        "Title": "It's So Much Work to Be Your Friend: Helping the Child with Learning Disabilities Find Social Success",
        "Authors": "By Lavoie, Richard",
        "Description": "As any parent, teacher, coach, or caregiver of a learning disabled child knows, every learning disability has a social component. The ADD child constantly interrupts conversations and doesn't follow directions. The child with visual-spatial issues loses his belongings and causes his siblings to be late to school. The child with paralinguistic difficulties appears stiff and wooden because she fails to gesture when she talks. These children are socially out of step with their classmates and peers, and often they are ridiculed or ostracized for their differences.  A successful social life is immeasurably important to a child's happiness, health, and development, but until now, no book has provided practical, expert advice on helping learning disabled children achieve social success.For more than thirty years, Richard Lavoie has lived with and taught learning disabled children. His bestselling PBS videos, including How Difficult Can This Be?: The F.A.T. City Workshop, and his sellout lectures and workshops have made him one of the most popular and respected experts in the field. At last, Rick's pioneering techniques for helping children achieve a happy and successful social life are available in book form.It's So Much Work to Be Your Friend offers practical strategies to help learning disabled children ages six through seventeen navigate the treacherous social waters of their school, home, and community. Rick examines the special social issues surrounding a wide variety of learning disabilities, including ADD and other attentional disorders, anxiety, paralinguistics, visual-spatial disorders, and executive functioning. Then he provides proven methods and step-by-step instructions for helping the learning disabled child through almost any social situation, including choosing a friend, going on a playdate, conducting a conversation, reading body language, overcoming shyness and low self-esteem, keeping track of belongings, living with siblings, and adjusting to new settings and situations.  Perhaps the most important component of this book is the author's compassion.  It comes through on every page that Rick feels the intensity with which children long for friends and acceptance, the exasperation they can cause in others, and the joy they feel in social connection. It's So Much Work to Be Your Friend answers the most intense yet, until now, silent need of the parents, teachers, and caregivers of learning disabled children -- or anyone who is associated with a child who needs a friend.",

        "Title": "We Are Their Heaven: Why the Dead Never Leave Us",
        "Authors": "By DuBois, Allison",
        "Description": "What happens to our loved ones when they die? Is there a heaven? Is there a true connection and communication between the living and the dead?With the success of the television series Medium and her first book, Don't Kiss Them Good-bye, millions of people have embraced Allison, her story, and her remarkable gift. The idea for We Are Their Heaven was born out of the pieces of communication that Allison received from the spirits who touched her over her years as a medium. In this book, she helps people to understand that we are so special to those who have died that they choose to remain with us, not because they're bound but because we are their happiness, we are their heaven.Now Allison brings readers into her psychic experiences. As we walk the continuum of life and death with her and meet the people whose lives she has touched, we feel the pain of loss and are at once saddened and then renewed by her experiences and the stories of loss and connection. Each chapter focuses on a different type of loss -- parents, children, friends, and spouses who have lost loved ones through accidents, murder, suicide, and illness.Throughout the book, people who have had readings with Allison share their experiences and the significance of their readings. They take us into their confidence and share the unique details, identifying the calling cards of the dead, the initial private piece of information that convinced them that they were communicating directly with their loved ones. Allison, in turn, takes us through the same readings and describes exactly what was delivered and how it was conveyed. She convinces us that an essential part of communicating with the deceased is learning how to read both their signs (the message) and their signature (the unique information). Through Allison's eyes, we see that the dead are trying to reach their living loved ones all the time. She explores timing, coincidence, auditory and sensory communications, dreams, visions, incident manipulation, and streaming events to affirm their attempts. Allison presents the riveting details of her communications -- what she hears, sees, and feels. Allison's desire to help these two worlds connect makes us want to reach out to her and at the same time fear for her. She shares her daily struggle of living with layers of information that few of us have about others and the world around us. Much like her character on the show, she often struggles with knowing when to intervene and when to keep her knowledge to herself.If you miss someone you love, take comfort in the fact that through the thousands of readings that Allison has done, no one has come through to say \"good-bye\" but rather to say \"hello again.\"",

        "Description": "Giant corporations wield excessive influence over our lives, often with frightening consequences: environmental destruction, political corruption, increased polarization of wealth, and stagnating wages and benefits. The rampant epidemic of accounting fraud, tax avoidance, outsourcing and war  profiteering in recent  years  has reconfirmed the widespread conviction that corporations are getting increasingly out of control, with potentially dangerous consequences for the communities where they operate, their own employees and even for their owners, the shareholders.  The People\u2019s Business tells us what we can do to fight back. Drutman and Cray show how corporations achieved their current privileged position and offer a comprehensive approach for reforming them so that they serve as engines of public prosperity, rather than as the tools of private plunder. They present recommendations from the prestigious members of the Citizen Works Commission on Corporate Reform\u2014which includes such notable members as Ralph Nader, David Korten, Herman Daly, Medea Benjamin, and many others\u2014to outline a clear-headed plan of action to: Get corporations out of politics Establish truly public-minded regulation of corporate behavior Combat unfair market domination by a handful of large corporations Crack down on corporate crime Challenge the corporate claim to constitutional rights Bolstered with relevant history and recent examples, The People\u2019s Business details immediate measures for effectively reforming the corporation.",

        "Description": "In a riveting new thriller from America's Queen of Suspense, a young woman is ensnared into returning to a place she had wanted to leave behind forever -- her childhood home. There, at the age of ten, Liza Barton had shot her mother, trying desperately to protect her from her estranged step-father, Ted Cartwright. Despite his claim that the shooting was a deliberate act, the Juvenile Court ruled the death an accident. Many people, however, agreed with Cartwright, and the tabloids compared her to the infamous murderess Lizzie Borden, pointing even to the similarity of their names.  To erase Liza's past, her adoptive parents change her name to Celia. At age twenty-eight, a successful interior designer in Manhattan, she marries a childless sixty-year-old widower, Laurence Foster, and they have a son. Before their marriage, she reveals to him her true identity. Two years later, on his deathbed, he makes her swear never to tell anyone so that their son, Jack, will not carry the stigma of her past.  Two years later, Celia is happily remarried. Her peace of mind is shattered when her new husband, Alex Nolan, surprises her with a gift -- the house in Mendham, New Jersey, where she killed her mother. On the day they move in, they find the words little lizzie's place -- beware painted on the lawn, splotches of red paint all over the house, and a skull and crossbones carved into the door.  More and more, there are signs that someone in the community knows Celia's true identity. When Georgette Grove, the real estate agent who sold the house to Alex, is brutally murdered and Celia is the first on the crime scene, she becomes a suspect.  As Celia fights to prove her innocence, she is not aware that she and her son, Jack, are now the targets of a killer.",

        "Description": "From first-day nerves to first-year grades, from bizarre job interviews to bar exam insanity, Ivy Briefs pulls back the curtain on the marbled halls of law school, revealing the absurdity often bubbling beneath the surface.Meet Martha Kimes: a na\u00efve small-town girl with strong neurotic tendencies who has (due to an inexplicable stroke of luck) been admitted to Columbia Law School. She's a Midwesterner in the middle of Manhattan, a student on the verge of a nervous breakdown. In her candid memoir -- the best of its kind since One L and the only one written by a woman -- Kimes makes her way through law school, doing battle with a memorable cast of characters: The Sadistic Professor: Every law student's nemesis, the Sadistic Professor takes pity on no one. The Socratic Method is his favorite torture device, and he's got staying power that rivals that of the Energizer Bunny.The Gunner: So enamored with the sound of his own voice, he finds it physically impossible to keep his hand from gunning up into the air every time a professor asks a question. Ten minutes into the start of the school year, everyone is already sick of the Gunner.The Do-gooder: Lurking behind a kind exterior is a pit bull ready to pounce on those who don't plan to devote their legal careers to public service. But would she be so quick to categorize all those who dare go into corporate law as loathsome, soulless warriors for the devil if she, too, had student loans to repay? The Boarding School Bastard: He wears a firmly pressed pin-striped oxford shirt and has a condescending attitude bigger than most European countries. By definition he is better than you because he went to Exeter. And he'll never let you forget it.With sharp wit, dead-on aim, and a healthy dose of self-deprecation, Kimes proves that it is possible to survive law school with both your sense of humor and your sanity intact.",

        "Authors": "By Dent, Harry S.",
        "Description": "For over fifteen years, New York Times bestselling author Harry S. Dent, Jr., has been uncannily accurate in predicting the financial future. In his three previous works, Dent predicted the financial recession of the early nineties, the economic expansion of the mid-nineties, and the financial free-for-all of 1998-2000.The Next Great Bubble Boom -- part crystal ball, part financial planner -- offers a comprehensive forecast for the next two decades, showing new models for predicting the future behavior of the economy, inflation, large- and small-cap stocks, bonds, key sectors, and so on. In taking a look at past booms and busts, Dent compares our current state to that of the crash of 1920-21, and the years ahead of us to the Roaring Twenties. Dent gives advice on everything from investment strategies to real estate cycles, and shows not only how bright our future will be but how best to profit from it.Dent gives us all something to look forward to, including:The Dow hitting 40,000 by the end of the decade The Nasdaq advancing at least ten times from its October 2001 lows to around 13,500, and potentially as high as 20,000 by 2009 Another strong advance in stocks in 2005, with a significant correction into around September/October 2006 The Great Boom resurging into its final and strongest stage in 2007, and even more fully in 2008, lasting until late 2009 to early 2010Dent's amazing ability to track and forecast our financial future is renowned, and here he takes that ability to the next level, showing not only what our economy will look like but also how it will affect us as individuals, as organizations, and as a culture. From the upcoming wealth revolution to the essential principles of entrepreneurial success, the book describes a new society where economic and philanthropic development go hand in hand. In The Next Great Bubble Boom, Dent shows not only how the economic growth of the late 1990s was a prelude to the true great boom right around the corner but how all of us can reap its benefits.",

He begins with a stunning account of the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, then turns to the main zones of conflict: Spain, from which the descendants of the Moors were eventually expelled; the Middle East, where Crusaders and Muslims clashed for years; and the Balkans, where distant memories spurred atrocities even into the twentieth century. Throughout, Wheatcroft delves beneath stereotypes, looking incisively at how images, ideas, language, and technology (from the printing press to the Internet), as well as politics, religion, and conquest, have allowed each side to demonize the other, revive old grievances, and fuel across centuries a seemingly unquenchable enmity. Finally, Wheatcroft tells how this fraught history led to our present maelstrom. We cannot, he argues, come to terms with today\u2019s perplexing animosities without confronting this dark past.",

        "Description": "Donald Ritchie offers a vibrant chronicle of news coverage in our nation's capital, from the early days of radio and print reporting and the heyday of the wire services to the brave new world of the Internet.         Beginning with 1932, when a newly elected FDR energized the sleepy capital, Ritchie highlights the dramatic changes in journalism that have occurred in the last seven decades. We meet legendary columnists--including Walter Lippmann, Joseph Alsop, and Drew Pearson --as well as the great investigative reporters, from Paul Y. Anderson to the two green Washington Post reporters who launched the political story of the decade--Woodward and Bernstein. We read of the rise of radio news--fought tooth and nail by the print barons--and of such pioneers as Edward R. Murrow, H. V. Kaltenborn, and Elmer Davis. Ritchie also offers a vivid history of TV news, from the early days of Meet the Press, to Huntley and Brinkley and Walter Cronkite, to the cable revolution led by C-SPAN and CNN. In addition, he compares political news on the Internet to the alternative press of the '60s and '70s; describes how black reporters slowly broke into the white press corps (helped mightily by FDR's White House); discusses path-breaking woman reporters such as Sarah McClendon and Helen Thomas, and much more.       From Walter Winchell to Matt Drudge, the people who cover Washington politics are among the most colorful and influential in American news. Reporting from Washington offers an unforgettable portrait of these figures as well as of the dramatic changes in American journalism in the twentieth century.",

This book will provide Christians with a unique, warm, and attractive presentation of the gospel to give to non-Christian family or friends.More than anything, God wants you to be with Him. The God who designed your world, the God who placed you on the planet, simply wants you home with Him. And to bring you home, He offers you a gift...the gift of eternal salvation. My prayer is that through the pages of this book you'll see his gift like you've never seen it. If you've already accepted it, you'll thank Him again. And if you've never accepted it, I pray that you will. For it's the gift of a lifetime. A gift for all people.",

What is certain is that the reader is in for a hell of a tale.Ranging widely over his own life and the lives of his nearest and dearest--the quick and not-so-quick--Garrett rewrites personal experience and history pretty much as he will. There is, for example, \"My Two One-Eyed Coaches,\" in which the author looks back with sharp nostalgia on his salad days at military school and at Princeton. He'll reexamine a career in the Army which, in retrospect, is darker than it once seemed. There are wise and irreverent observations on his forebears who fought in the War Between the States. Mix in Garrett's fresh commentaries on the state of politics and the literary swim, and you have a rich stew, fit for a fine palate but with a stick-to-the-ribsness about it.George Garrett's musings should be read in a state of lively comfort. So sit up and settle back: you're in for the best bellyful you've had in a long time.",

        "Description": "The brilliant sequel to Gore Vidal\u2019s acclaimed, bestselling memoir, Palimpsest.In Point to Point Navigation, the celebrated novelist, essayist, critic, and controversialist Gore Vidal ranges freely over his remarkable life with the signature wit and literary elegance that is uniquely his. The title refers to a form of navigation he resorted to as a first mate in the Navy during World War II. As he says, \u201cAs I was writing this account of my life and times since Palimpsest, I felt as if I were again dealing with those capes and rocks in the Bering Sea that we had to navigate so often with a compass made inoperable by weather.\u201d It is a beautifully apt analogy for the hazards (mostly) eluded during his eventful life and for the way this memoir proceeds\u2014far from linear but always on course.From his desks in Ravello and the Hollywood Hills, Gore Vidal travels in memory through the arenas of literature, television, film, theater, politics and international society where he has cut a broad swath, recounting achievements and defeats, friends and enemies made (and on a number of occasions lost). Among the gathering of notables to be found in these pages, sketched with a draftsman\u2019s ease and evoked with the panache of one of our great raconteurs, are Jack and Jacqueline Kennedy, Tennessee Williams (the \u201cGlorious Bird\u201d), Eleanor Roosevelt, Orson Welles, Johnny Carson, Greta Garbo, Federico Fellini, Rudolph Nureyev, Elia Kazan, and Francis Ford Coppola. Some of the book\u2019s most moving pages are devoted to the illness and death of his partner of five decades, Howard Austen, and indeed the book is, among other things, a meditation on mortality written in the spirit of Montaigne.Elegiac yet vital and even ornery, Point to Point Navigation is a summing-up of Gore Vidal\u2019s time on the planet that manages to be at once supremely entertaining, endlessly provocative, and thoroughly moving.",

Shriver\u2019s myriad historical legacies are testaments to the power of his vision and his ability to inspire others. But it is the colorful personality and indomitable spirit of the man himself\u2014traits that allowed him to survive the Depression, WWII, and the Kennedy family\u2014that will inspire readers today to expand the \u201chorizons of the possible.\u201d",

        "Authors": "By Kerber, Linda K. (EDT), Sklar, Kathryn Kish, Kessler-Harris, Alice (EDT), and Sklar, Kathryn Kish (EDT)",
        "Description": "This outstanding collection of fifteen original essays represents innovative work by some of the most influential scholars in the field of women's history. Covering a broad sweep of history from colonial to contemporary times and ranging over the fields of legal, social, political, and cultural history, this book, according to its editors, 'intrudes into regions of the American historical narrative from which women have been excluded or in which gender relations were not thought to play a part.'      State formation, power, and knowledge have not traditionally been understood as the subjects of women's history, but they are the themes that permeate this book. Individually and together, the essays explore how gender serves to legitimize particular constructions of power and knowledge and to meld these into accepted practice and state policy. They show how the field of women's history has moved from the discovery of women to an evaluation of social processes and institutions.      The book is dedicated to pioneering women's historian Gerda Lerner, whose work inspired so many of the contributors, and it includes a bibliography of her works.    from the book  The contributors to this volume grew up into a world in which history was rigidly limited. It paid little attention to social relationships, to issues of race, to the concerns of the poor, and virtually none to women. Women figured in it for their ritual status, as wives of presidents like Abigail Adams or Dolly Madison; for their role as spoilers, from the witches of Salem to Mary Todd Lincoln, or for their sacrificial caregiving, like Clara Barton or Dorothea Dix. Even when women like Sojourner Truth, Jane Addams, and Eleanor Roosevelt were named by historians, the radical substance of their work and their lives was routinely ignored. A very few historians of women--Eleanor Flexner, Julia Cherry Spruill, Caroline Ware--worked on the margins of the profession, their contributions unappreciated, and their writing vulnerable to the charge of irrelevance.    Contents    Part 1.  State Formation    Linda K. Kerber on women and the obligations of citizenship  Kathryn Kish Sklar on two political cultures in the Progressive Era  Linda Gordon on women, maternalism, and welfare in the twentieth century  Alice Kessler-Harris on the Social Security Amendments of 1939  Nancy F.
