More important, it shows how to get your work done faster with less typing.  Even if you've used UNIX for years,  techniques described in this book can make you more efficient.You'll learn how to:Make your prompt tell you where you are (no more pwd)Use what you've typed before (history)Type long command lines with very few keystrokes (command and     filename completion)Remind yourself of filenames when in the middle of typing a     commandEdit a botched command instead of retyping itThis book does not cover programming or script writing in csh ortcsh because the tasks are better done with a different shell,  such as sh (the Bourne shell) or a language like Perl.",

The 22 famous authors commence with Michel de Montaigne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and glide into the 20th century with Marcel Proust, Henry Miller, Vladimir Nabokov, John Fowles, and Sven Birkerts.  Some of the offerings are pedantical and instructive while others share a surprising point of view e.g. Miller says his promiscuous reading ruined him.  Our favorites are Stanley Elkins's ruminations on spending a year reading in bed before his PhD preliminaries, and Birkerts's reminisces of having to get \"vertical\" to please his father.
