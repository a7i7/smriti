        "Description": "A fascinating collection of revealing and entertaining interviews by the award-winning host of National Public Radio's premier interview program Fresh Air.Over the last twenty years, Terry Gross has interviewed many of our most celebrated writers, actors, musicians, comics, and visual artists. Her show, Fresh Air with Terry Gross, a weekday magazine of contemporary arts and issues produced by WHYY in Philadelphia, is one of National Public Radio's most popular programs. More than four million people tune in to the show, which is broadcast on over 400 NPR stations across the country.Gross is known for her thoughtful, probing interviewing style. In her trusted company, even the most reticent guest relaxes and opens up. But Gross doesn't shy away from controversy, and her questions can be tough--too tough, apparently, for Bill O'Reilly, who abruptly terminated his conversation with her. Her interview with Gene Simmons of Kiss, which is included in the book, prompted Entertainment Weekly to name Simmons its male \"Crackpot of the Year.\"For All I Did Was Ask, Gross has selected more than three dozen of her best interviews--ones of lasting relevance that are as lively on the page as they were on the air. Each is preceded by a personal introduction in which she reveals why a particular guest was on the show and the thinking behind some of her questions. And in an introductory chapter, the normally self-effacing Gross does something you're unlikely ever to hear her do on Fresh Air--she discusses her approach to interviewing, revealing a thing or two about herself in the bargain.The collection focuses on luminaries from the art and entertainment world, including actors, comedians, writers, visual artists, and musicians, such as:  Conan O'Brien  Chris Rock  Michael Caine  Dennis Hopper  Dustin Hoffman  Jodie Foster  John Updike  Mary Karr  Mario Puzo  Nick Hornby  Chuck Close  Eric Clapton  George Clinton  Sonny Rollins  Samuel L. Jackson  Johnny Cash  Isabella Rossellini  Divine  Uta Hagen  Carol Shields",

It shows what life on the frontier was really like, and portrays the brave, unpredictable and sometimes violent men and women who explored, fought over and finally tamed a continent.Jon E. Lewis vividly depicts the pioneers, the onrush of the cattle barons, the coming of the lawmen and the tragic demise of the Plains Indians. Heroes and villains - including Sitting Bull, Doc Holliday, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Crazy Horse and Custer - are often revealed in a startling new light, and a host of minor characters are rescued from obscurity. The book pays full homage to the part played by women and African-Americans and includes a mass of intriguing and fascinating detail - from how Montana cowboys warmed their horses' bits to the words of the Navajo medicine chants.",

        "Title": "Empires on the Pacific: World War Ii and the Struggle for the Mastery of Asia",
        "Authors": "By Thompson, Robert Smith",
        "Description": "By moving China to center stage, Robert Smith Thompson expands the traditional boundaries of the Pacific Theater of World War II and casts the conflict in an entirely new light. What is commonly viewed as a discrete military conflict between an aggressive Japan with imperial ambitions and a reluctant, passive America now becomes the stuff of Greek tragedy. The overreaching British Empire is waning, yet is unwilling to relinquish its foothold in China, while an increasingly ambitious Japan is determined to dominate the region and conquer China as part of that plan. Enter the young upstart, America, with imperial ambitions of its own in Asia. The United States meant to replace Britain as the dominant power in Asia and saw Japan as a direct threat to that dominance. For Franklin Delano Roosevelt and for the United States, the war with Japan had little to do with revenge for Pearl Harbor. Japan would have to be vanquished so that it would never again be an imperial rival.This recasting of the Asian conflict profoundly alters our understanding not just of World War II in the Pacific but also of what followed in the Korean War and the war in Vietnam. Revisionist history at its best, Empires on the Pacific will provoke discussion and debate and it will alter our view of what many still consider the last \"good war.\"Interest in WWII has never been higher: The summertime release of Touchstone Pictures' blockbuster Pearl Harbor-accompanied by Basic Books' own Pearl Harbor (April 19 release)-will create tremendous interest in the Pacific theater of WWII. Timely publication: The book anticipates the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 2001. Striking, revisionist, controversial: America's wartime actions in the Pacific were not revenge for Pearl Harbor but were part of America's larger imperial ambitions to replace the British Empire as the dominant force in Asia, and, especially, in China. America won the war with Japan but lost the peace, which led, inevitably, to the Korean War and to the war in Vietnam. A long overdue explanation of what America's war against Japan was all about-in a word: China.",

She was soon to experience a coming-of-age filled with the turmoil and upheaval that devastated the wartime South. She set down the Remarkable events of the war in a record that remains one of the most vivid, evocative portrayals in existence of a time and place that today make up a crucial chapter in our national history.  Sarah Morgan herself emerges as one of the most memorable nineteenth-century women in fiction or nonfiction, a young woman of intelligence and fortitude, as well as of high spirits and passion, who questioned the society into which she was born and the meaning of the war for ordinary families like her own and for the divided nation as a whole.  Now published in its entirety for the first time, Sarah Morgan's classic account brings the Civil War and the Old South to life with all the freshness and immediacy of great literature.",

        "Description": "It is the summer of 1983, and young Nick Guest has moved into an attic room in the Notting Hill home of the Feddens: Gerald, an ambitious new Tory MP, his wealthy wife Rachel, and their children Toby and Catherine. Nick had idolized Toby at Oxford, but in his London life it will be the troubled Catherine, the critic and rebel of the family, who becomes both his friend and his uneasy responsibility.As the boom years of the mid-80s unfold, Nick, an innocent in matters of politics and money, becomes caught up in the Feddens' world - its grand parties, its surprising alliances, its parade of monsters both comic and menacing. In an era of endless possibility, Nick finds himself able to pursue his own private obsession, with beauty - a prize as compelling to him as power and riches are to his friends. An affair with a young black council worker gives him his first experience of romance; but it is a later affair, with a beautiful millionaire, that will change his life more drastically and bring into question the larger fantasies of a ruthless decade.Framed by the two general elections which returned Mrs. Thatcher to power, The Line of Beauty unfurls through four extraordinary years of change and tragedy. Richly textured, emotionally charged, disarmingly funny, it is a major work by one of the finest writers in the English language.",

And meeting Buzz, the star's good-looking manager, hits her in a way she doesn't expect - somewhere right below the solar plexus.Leaping before she looks, Lee engages in a clandestine affair without envisioning its consequences - from jeopardizing her relationship with Tommy to something far more dangerous - until it is almost too late.

Where else but Schott's Original Miscellany will you stumble across the name of John Lennon's cat, the supplier of bagpipes to the Queen, and the brutal methods of murder encountered by Miss Marple? An encyclopedia? A dictionary? An anthology? An almanac? An amphigouri? A treasury? A commonplace book? Well... yes. Schott's Original Miscellany is all these and, of course, more. A book like no other, Schott's Original Miscellany is entertaining, informative, unpredictible, and utterly addictive. Ben Schott is a photographer, designer, and trivia collector. He is twenty-eight (although he believes you might prefer to picture him as a white-haired librarian) and lives in Highgate, London.",

        "Description": "The American Dream is in decline. Americans are increasingly overworked, underpaid, and squeezed for time. But there is an alternative: the European Dream-a more leisurely, healthy, prosperous, and sustainable way of life. Europe's lifestyle is not only desirable, argues Jeremy Rifkin, but may be crucial to sustaining prosperity in the new era.     With the dawn of the European Union, Europe has become an economic superpower in its own right-its GDP now surpasses that of the United States. Europe has achieved newfound dominance not by single-mindedly driving up stock prices, expanding working hours, and pressing every household into a double- wage-earner conundrum. Instead, the New Europe relies on market networks that place cooperation above competition; promotes a new sense of citizenship that extols the well-being of the whole person and the community rather than the dominant individual; and recognizes the necessity of deep play and leisure to create a better, more productive, and healthier workforce.   From the medieval era to modernity, Rifkin delves deeply into the history of Europe, and eventually America, to show how the continent has succeeded in slowly and steadily developing a more adaptive, sensible way of working and living. In The European Dream, Rifkin posits a dawning truth that only the most jingoistic can ignore: Europe's flexible, communitarian model of society, business, and citizenship is better suited to the challenges of the twenty-first century. Indeed, the European Dream may come to define the new century as the American Dream defined the century now past.",

        "Description": "By all accounts, Henry Seine should have packed it in long ago, certainly before he started scanning marine distress channels for fun. But sixteen-hour days spent hauling heavy cargo aboard tugs and icebreakers along the frozen arctic offshore (not to mention smoking copious amounts of Cannabis indica) can warp a man\u2019s sense of reality. Desperate for real human contact, he tunes the sideband radio to 2182 kHz (twenty-one eighty-two kilohertz), the international distress channel, in the vague hope of finding someone he can save.  Soon, though, even the paycheck that fattens his wallet each season isn\u2019t enough to fix his interest. Seine journeys south, but weathers a capsizing that leaves his fellow crewmen dead. Unable to break from his old habits, and haunted by the ghosts of dead shipmates, he flies north for another season. One day, idly monitoring 2182, Seine catches a fading distress call from somewhere out in the circumpolar twilight. A scientist named Louis Moneymaker is trapped alone on an ice floe that threatens to melt beneath his feet. Cobbling together a motley rescue team\u2013the frostbitten Wolf, a six-foot-eight Russian known as Big Man, a tattooed Eskimo nicknamed the Buff, and an intrepid, dark-eyed sailor named Julia\u2013Seine travels farther north than he\u2019s ever gone, determined to save Moneymaker and exorcise his demons in one grand sweep.  2182 kHz combines the white-knuckle adventure of The Perfect Storm with the dark humor and deadpan wit of Chuck Palahniuk to create an absorbing tale of search-and-rescue. David Masiel introduces us to a compelling antihero who is only one step away from either destruction or salvation.",

In COOKSMART, she returns with can't-fail recipes for everyday meals we all love, from spaghetti and meatballs, oven-fried chicken, and fajitas to foods for special occasions like crab cakes and vegetable lasagna. Pam knows today's cooks are too busy to tolerate less than superb results.

It means reducing the time and effort that go into a dish while delivering every bit of the flavor.

Cooking smart also means creating dishes the whole family can enjoy, such as turkey burgers as juicy as the best all-beef burgers but much lower in fat and cholesterol, and a crisp and creamy Caesar salad that isn't made with raw eggs.     COOKSMART recipes eliminate the unnecessary steps and troublesome quirks that keep you from making your favorite dishes. You'll learn how to prepare a pot roast as juicy and tender as the old-fashioned kind in just ninety minutes. You won't need special equipment for the meals in this book. Every ingredient used can be found in your local supermarket.

In every case, cooking smart means making a dish the very best it can be: a gazpacho chock full of summer-vegetable flavor, a pasta salad that -- for once! -- tastes as good as it looks, and a peach pie with a crisp crust and a fruity flavor that slices to perfection.     In COOKSMART, you'll not only get more than a hundred impeccable dishes that will become part of your cherished repertoire, but you'll acquire a wealth of culinary knowledge that you can apply to other recipes.",

        "Title": "Fighting with Allies:: America and Britain in Peace and War",
        "Authors": "By Renwick, Robin",
        "Description": "There is a great myth that Britain and America have always been the closest of allies, standing side by side in times of trouble, helping each other unquestionably and with a shared sense of united destiny. In his grand Fighting with Allies, former British ambassador Sir Robin Renwick illuminates as never before the tensions and battles that have defined the Anglo-American \"special relationship.\"Beginning in the early nineteenth century, Renwick goes behind the scenes to give us dramatic and revealing portraits of the personalities and events that have shaped the two nations. Drawing liberally on first-person accounts, private letters, and diaries, Renwick has crafted a narrative that manages to be intimate and personal even as it takes us through some of the most exciting and spectacular events of the past century and a half. Renwick's cast of characters is astonishing, and among those we meet are Rear Admiral George Cockburn, who burned the White House to the ground during the War of 1812; Theodore Roosevelt, who found intellectual inspiration in Rudyard Kipling; Woodrow Wilson, who declared America \"too proud to fight\"; Lloyd George, who patronized the Americans even as he began to realize that they would become the greater power; Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill (himself half American), who brought the alliance together to face the greatest threat the world had ever known; Harry Truman, who found himself caught in a delicate balancing act between Stalin and Churchill; Clement Attlee, who defeated Churchill for the prime ministership and then, with Truman and Dean Acheson, helped preside over the formation of NATO and the reluctant transformation of British Palestine into the state of Israel; Dwight Eisenhower, whom Churchill blamed for the failure of Allied forces to occupy Berlin and Prague; Anthony Eden, who doubted America's capacities in international affairs; John F. Kennedy, whose close friendship with Harold Macmillan brought the alliance to a new stage; Harold Wilson, accused of servility toward Lyndon Johnson, whose Vietnam nightmare threatened relations; Richard Nixon, who correctly predicted Wilson's downfall only to find that Edward Heath saw British interests to be more with Europe than with America; Jimmy Carter, whose own foreign policy was crippled by internal debates and debacles; Margaret Thatcher, who found a soul mate in Ronald Reagan and helped the alliance reach its strongest point in decades; George Bush, who shifted America's focus from Britain to Europe; and Bill Clinton and John Major, both confronted with a bloody war in the Balkans and unsure how to deal with it.",

        "Title": "Brother Woodrow: A Memoir of Woodrow Wilson by Stockton Axson (Papers of Woodrow Wilson, Supplementary Volumes, 5)",
        "Authors": "By Link, Arthur Stanley (EDT) and Axson, Stockton",
        "Description": "This memoir of Woodrow Wilson is a long-neglected treasure, full of the candid and perceptive observations of Wilson's brother-in-law and close friend, Stockton Axson. A charming and talented scholar of English literature, Axson became one of the few people in whom the reticent Wilson confided freely. Axson and Wilson met in 1884, when Wilson was courting Axson's sister Ellen, while Axson was still a school boy. The friendship of the two men ended only with the president's death in 1924. Axson's fondness for his mentor, \"Brother Woodrow,\" pervades this account, but he is frank in his analysis of Wilson's flaws. As one of only a few personal memoirs of Wilson, this book offers a uniquely intimate view of the \"human side\" of the introverted president--and a sensitive evocation of the social life of a bygone era.Axson begins with memories of Wilson's father and of Wilson's life as a young man, including his engagement and marriage to Ellen Axson and his early teaching posts. Wilson taught for twelve years at Princeton University before his accession to its presidency, and Axson also taught there during this period. After Wilson began his stormy career as president of Princeton, Axson's bachelor quarters were often a meeting place for the \"Wilson faction.\" His lucid analysis of Wilson's successes and failures as Princeton's president is one of the highlights of the book--and probably the best record of these years of Wilson's life.The book ends with a look behind the scenes of Wilson's career as governor of New Jersey and president of the United States, and an analysis of the growing complexity of his personality. \"It is Uncle Joseph [Wilson's father] in him,\" observed one relative of Wilson's seeming rigidity. From the standpoint of a loving family member, Axson offers a penetrating but sympathetic report on how Wilson changed as he bore the terrible burdens of World War I and its aftermath.Originally published in 1993.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

        "Title": "Honor's Voice: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln",
        "Authors": "By Wilson, Douglas L.",
        "Description": "Abraham Lincoln's remarkable emergence from the rural Midwest and his rise to the presidency have been the stuff of romance and legend. But as Douglas L. Wilson shows us in Honor's Voice, Lincoln's transformation was not one long triumphal march, but a process that was more than once seriously derailed. There were times, in his journey from storekeeper and mill operator to lawyer and member of the Illinois state legislature, when Lincoln lost his nerve and self-confidence - on at least two occasions he became so despondent as to appear suicidal - and when his acute emotional vulnerabilities were exposed.Focusing on the crucial years between 1831 and 1842, Wilson's skillful analysis of the testimonies and writings of Lincoln's contemporaries reveals the individual behind the legends. We see Lincoln as a boy: not the dutiful son studying by firelight, but the stubborn rebel determined to make something of himself. We see him as a young man: not the ascendant statesman, but the canny local politician who was renowned for his talents in wrestling and storytelling (as well as for his extensive store of off-color jokes). Wilson also reconstructs Lincoln's frequently anguished personal life: his religious skepticism, recurrent bouts of depression, and difficult relationships with women - from Ann Rutledge to Mary Owens to Mary Todd.Meticulously researched and well written, this is a fascinating book that makes us reexamine our ideas about one of the icons of American history.",

More than eighty thousand people subscribe to The Hightower Lowdown Newsletter while his radio show is aired on more than sixty public and commercial radio stations.  In They've Stolen Our Country and It's Time To Take It Back, he takes on the Bushites, the Wobblycrats, and the corporate Kleptocrats, digging up behind-the-scenes dirt that the corporate media overlooks-like BushCo's \"Friday Night Massacres,\" what's happened to our food, and the Bush plan for empire. But the book also offers grassroots solutions, drawing on Hightower's Rolling Thunder Down-Home Democracy Tour, a traveling festival of rebellion against every tentacle of the corporate-politico power grab. At kitchen tables all over America, Hightower has tapped into the thriving activist networks that are our country's grassroots muscle, and his book tells their uplifting stories of retaking control of their communities. This is the real America that the rest of the world doesn't get to see.  With his unique blend of wit and outrage, Jim Hightower \"lights a prairie fire\"-and it's just the spark that his growing national audience craves.",

Fifteen feet tall and indescribably beautiful - or unbelievably hideous, depending on your point of view - the alien invaders treated humankind in the worst way imaginable.They ignored us. They made no attempt to communicate with us. Walling themselves in impenetrable enclaves, enslaving a few willing collaborators with their telepathic PUSH, they casually plunged the rest of the Earth into a new Dark Age without electricity. Our few pathetic attempts at fighting back resulted in murderous plagues and mass executions, quickly convincing us that resistance was futile. The Entities' silent message was clear: We were allowed to live, but no longer as a dominant species.But a few refused to believe. Among them were the Carmichaels: a far-flung family of aviators, soldiers, misfits, hustlers, and hackers. As the world darkened into chaos around them, they gathered in their enclave in the hills of Santa Barbara, led by a patriarchal colonel who had learned to hate war in Vietnam and found himself devoting his life, and the lives of his descendants, to keeping the idea of resistance alive. The colonel's legacy is carried on by an unlikely team: an aging hippie, a cold-blooded Muslim assassin, a prodigal son, and a renegade hacker all united in spirit, who will penetrate the inner halls of cyberspace to kill the mysterious Prime Entity and free the planet the rest of us have all but forgotten how to love.",

The shooting took place directly across the street from the White House, the home of Sickles's friend and protector, President James Buchanan. Sickles turned himself in; political friends in New York's Tammany Hall machinery, including the dynamic criminal lawyer James Brady, quickly gathered around. While his beautiful young wife was banned from public life and shunned by society, Dan Sickles was acquitted.American Scoundrel is the story of this powerful mid-nineteenth-century politician and inveterate womanizer, whose irresistible charms and rock-solid connections not only allowed him to get away with murder - literally - but also paved the way to a stunning career.",

        "Description": "Have you tried sewing with no needles and no thread? Introduce yourself to fusible sewing--the stitchless, press-on way to make clothes, decorations, and gifts. Simply place adhesives between two layers of fabric and secure them with a touch of your iron. With fusibles, once difficult, time-consuming tasks are finished quickly, easily, and with professional results. Some adhesives iron directly onto cloth, others come with a paper backing that protects it and the fabric from your iron. You'll find lots of situations where fusibles are better than sewing, including seaming two layers of fabric, hemming a raw edge, binding a cut edge, and applying trim, fringe, or tassels. And, for times when you don't want a seam to show, fusibles are the perfect solution. With fusibles you can also create no-sew appliques, make perfect covered cording, and laminate a fabric. Projects featured here include pillows, place mats, shower curtains, box covers, desk sets, reversible curtains, sofa throws, and many imaginative  gifts.  128 pages (all in color), 8 1/2 x 10.

        "Description": "He was a pioneer in modern law enforcement, a trailblazing leader in the hunt for serial killers. But after decades of staring deep into the darkness, he entered a seminary to search for the good... BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL No one gets closer to evil than a criminal profiler, trained to penetrate the hearts and minds of society's most vicious psychopaths. And no one is a more towering figure in the world of criminal profilers than Roger L. Depue. Chief of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit at a time when its innovative work first came to prominence, he headed a renowned team of mind hunters that included John Douglas, Robert Ressler, and Roy Hazelwood. In a subbasement sixty feet under the Academy gun vault in Quantico, he broke new ground with analytical techniques and training programs that are still used today. After retiring from the FBI, he founded an elite forensics group that consulted on high-profile cases, including the Martha Moxley and JonBenet Ramsey murders, and the Columbine school shootings. But coming face-to-face with the darkest deeds human beings are capable of took a horrific toll. After suffering a devastating personal loss, Depue, on the brink of despair, walked away from the outside world and joined a seminary. For three years this was his safe haven, a place where he exorcised personal demons and found a refuge from terrifying memories of real-life monsters. And it was there, while counseling maximum security inmates, that he rediscovered the capacity for goodness in people, and made the decision to return to the world to resume his work. Here is Depue's extraordinary personal account, from growing up as a police officer's son to tracking down some of today's most brutal murderers. With its harrowing descriptions of human depravity and passionate call to fight against evil, BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL is both a riveting dispatch from the front lines of a war against human predators...and the powerful story of one man's journey between darkness and redemption.",
