But in the 1950s and 1960s, they were a pop culture phenomenon. The Great Books of Western Civilization, fifty-four volumes chosen by intellectuals at the University of Chicago, began as an educational movement, and evolved into a successful marketing idea. Why did a million American households buy books by Hippocrates and Nicomachus from door-to-door salesmen? And how and why did the great books fall out of fashion?In A Great Idea at the Time Alex Beam explores the Great Books mania, in an entertaining and strangely poignant portrait of American popular culture on the threshold of the television age. Populated with memorable characters, A Great Idea at the Time will leave readers asking themselves: Have I read Lucretius\u2019s De Rerum Natura lately? If not, why not?",

        "Title": "Beyond 2012: Catastrophe or Awakening?: A Complete Guide to End-of-Time Predictions",
        "Authors": "By Stray, Geoff",
        "Description": "An illustrated, encyclopedic overview of the prophecies, calendars, and theories that indicate the year 2012 is a threshold of great change for humanity  \u2022 Looks at the scientific and anthropological evidence for the rare galactic alignment due to occur in December 2012  \u2022 Sifts through the catastrophic theories to show what we might really expect in 2012  In December of 2012 the Mayan Calendar\u2019s Great Cycle will come to an end. Opinion remains divided as to whether apocalyptic scenarios of worldwide destruction or utopian visions of a spiritually renewed humanity will prevail after this key date has passed. What is certain, however, is that a rare galactic alignment will occur, one so unique that it is found at the core of many wisdom traditions from around the globe.  Geoff Stray has been collecting the vast amounts of data relating to the 2012 phenomena since 1982. Far from confining his research to the Maya, who provide the most prominent predictions indicating this date will herald significant changes for humanity, he has studied the prophetic traditions of other cultures--including the Tibetan, Chinese, Jewish, Ethiopian, and tribal cultures from around the globe--to show the kind of convergence of cosmic purposes happening along a number of parallel tracks. This book offers an extensive study of many modern theories, including Terence McKenna\u2019s timewave zero and Maurice Cotterell\u2019s sunspot research as well as anomalous phenomena such as near death experiences and crop circles. Sifting through all the scientific research and speculation that the year 2012 has inspired, Geoff Stray provides an encyclopedic look at what we might really expect on this pivotal date.",

        "Description": "Illustrated by Marie-Louise Gay. Usually it's the grandparent who takes the grandchild out. But here roles are reversed in a heartwarming story about a little girl who takes her grandmother to the museum for her first visit, allowing them to share something very special together. Written by Lois Wyse, the bestselling author of Funny, You Don't Look Like a Grandmother, with her ten-year-old granddaughter, Molly Rose Goldman, How to Take Your Grandmother to the Museum is a charming story of an adventurous little girl and her willing and eager grandmother, and the things they discover during a museum outing together. They visit Apatosaurus, whose bones are even older than Grandma's, and put on their pretend hiking boots for a trek to the Arctic. They imagine elephants trumpeting in the African Hall and travel through time to the Ice Age. How to Take Your Grandmother to the Museum mixes photographs with Marie-Louise Gay's whimsical illustrations for a realistic view of the museum, and includes two pages of additional information about the exhibits. But most of all, it's about that very special relationship between grandparent and grandchild, and how the young can often lead grown-ups to the joy of unexpected insight. ,By the author of Funny, You Don't Look Like a Grandmother and other books, with over 4.5 million copies in print. For children ages 5-8. 26,000 copies in print.",

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.\u00a0One of Dickens\u2019s most popular novels, Oliver Twist is the story of a young orphan who dares to say, \"Please, sir, I want some more.\" After escaping from the dark and dismal workhouse where he was born, Oliver finds himself on the mean streets of Victorian-era London and is unwittingly recruited into a scabrous gang of scheming urchins. In this band of petty thieves Oliver encounters the extraordinary and vibrant characters who have captured readers\u2019 imaginations for more than 150 years: the loathsome Fagin, the beautiful and tragic Nancy, the crafty Artful Dodger, and perhaps one of the greatest villains of all time\u2014the terrifying Bill Sikes.Rife with Dickens\u2019s disturbing descriptions of street life, the novel is buoyed by the purity of the orphan Oliver. Though he is treated with cruelty and surrounded by coarseness for most of his life, his pious innocence leads him at last to salvation\u2014and the shocking discovery of his true identity.\u00a0Features illustrations by George Cruikshank. \u00a0Jill Muller was born in England and educated at Mercy College and Columbia University, and currently teaches at Mercy College and Columbia University.
