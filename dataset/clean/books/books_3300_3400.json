With Hope Edelman's Motherless Daughters, millions of women found comfort in the experiences of other women who had lost their mothers. But until now, no book has been available to guide men through what can be an equally wrenching and life-changing event. Based on a landmark national survey of 300 men, and in-depth interviews with 70 others, FatherLoss is the first book that focuses specifically on how sons cope with the deaths of their dads. Chethik offers rich portraits of a variety of father-son relationships, and focuses on how the death of a father affects sons differently, depending on when in their lives it occurs. He also explores how such cultural figures as Ernest Hemingway, Dwight Eisenhower, and Michael Jordan were affected by the loss of their fathers. By weaving together the poignant experiences of diverse men and the results of his groundbreaking survey, Chethik offers fresh insight into the unique male grieving process, encouraging men to share an experience too many have been conditioned to endure in silence.",

Trade has been replaced by a business-friendly policy of \"asset realization\" ... which some might call piracy.Corporate starships of the Zantiu-Braun 3rd Fleet deploy to colonies, disgorging hordes of invulnerable soldiers called Skins. Enforcing their dictates with both orbital weapons and civilian hostages, the Skins loot whole planets, leaving only poverty, misery, and an industrial infrastructure - so that a few years later, Z-B can harvest again.But on the bucolic world of Thallspring, Z-B's plans are about to go badly awry, all because of: Sgt. Lawrence Newton: In his teens, Lawrence abandoned a life of privilege and love to pursue a dream of seeing the stars. Twenty years of violence as a Skin have destroyed all his hopes and desires, except for one ...; Denise Ebourn: An energetic, dedicated young schoolteacher with a penchant for spinning fables of wondrous lost worlds, Denise is also a guerrilla resistance leader whose tactics would put Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh, or even George Washington to shame. But then, they were only human ...; and Simon Roderick: Z-B's Director of Internal Security serves management with a transcendent dedication that nobody, perhaps not even he himself, can hope to understand . . .Now Lawrence just wants to buy his way out of Z-B by stealing a treasure he believes is stashed in a backwater province on Thallspring. Yet his \"score\" is also the one thing that Denise will protect at all costs, and that Roderick must possess at any price.",

In Search of Schrodinger's Cat tells the complete story of quantum mechanics, a truth stranger than any fiction. John Gribbin takes us step by step into an ever more bizarre and fascinating place, requiring only that we approach it with an open mind. He introduces the scientists who developed quantum theory. He investigates the atom, radiation, time travel, the birth of the universe, superconductors and life itself. And in a world full of its own delights, mysteries and surprises, he searches for Schrodinger's Cat - a search for quantum reality - as he brings every reader to a clear understanding of the most important area of scientific study today - quantum physics. In Search of Schrodinger's Cat is a fascinating and delightful introduction to the strange world of the quantum - an essential element in understanding today's world.",

        "Description": "\"Like werewolves. Zombies. Succubi, incubi....Everything you ever dreaded was under your bed and told yourself couldn't be by the light of day.\" -- Giles, \"Welcome to the Hellmouth\"  Vampires, werewolves, witches, demons of nonspecific origin. All of them are drawn to the Hellmouth in Sunnydale. California. And all of them have met their fate at the hands -- or stake -- of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Since its premiere. the popular TV show has pitted the Chosen One against the forces of darkness on a weekly basis. And her success is due in part to the intense research her Watcher Rupert Giles. and the rest of the gang have done to find the origin and best method of disposal for each villain.  The Monster Book expands upon information revealed through Giles' research and knowledge, exploring the mythological, literary, and cultural origins of the endless numbers of ghoulish creatures that have tried to take a piece of the Slayer. Before the Master, there was Dracula, before \"Becoming,\" there was Nosferatu. Before Buffy, there was...no one. The true horror fan knows that the legend of the vampire has existed for as long as there have been legends. But the demons that greet the business end of Buffy's stake are one part tradition, three parts creative genius. Indeed, the Buffy creators have purposefully moved away from recent vampire fictions to find a middle ground among ancient lore, Bram Stoker's \"rules.\" and their own twist on the topic.  \"Well, if we close our eyes and say it's all just a dream it'll stab us to death. These things are real.\" -- Xander. \"Fear, Itself\"  Here you'll find exclusive interviews with series creator Joss Whedon and the Emmy\u00ae-nominated team that creates the images you can't shake. The Monster Book welcomes you to the Hellmouth.  Enter at your own risk.  \"Wish me monsters.\" -- Buffy, \"Living Conditions\"",

        "Authors": "By Perry, George C.",
        "Description": "Famous for such Broadway hits as Jesus Christ Superstar, Cats, and Phantom of the Opera, Andrew Lloyd Webber has now transformed the classic Hollywood film Sunset Boulevard into a stunning theatrical experience. From the movie's portrayal of obsession in Hollywood and its atmosphere of romance, decadence, and cynicism, Lloyd Webber has created a haunting score and one of the greatest musicals of all time. This lavishly illustrated, definitive account traces the origins of the film and tells the fascinating story of the making of Lloyd Webber's latest masterpiece.Directed by Billy Wilder, the film Sunset Boulevard first appeared in 1950 with Oscar-nominee Gloria Swanson in the most memorable role of her career. As Norma Desmond, the great star of the silent screen, she attempted to use a failed young screenwriter, played by William Holden, as the means to make her return to the movies. Among the hundreds of films set in Los Angeles that used the silver screen as a mirror for Hollywood culture, Sunset Boulevard is recognized as one of the finest and has had an extraordinary influence on Hollywood cinema and film noir.As an introduction to Wilder's film, author George Perry looks at the famous street, Sunset Boulevard, and the history of silent movies. He describes the creation of the film and its significance in the chronology of American cinema and includes a recent interview with the director, archival photographs, and film memorabilia.For the remarkable musical staging of Sunset Boulevard, Andrew Lloyd Webber amassed a wealth of artistic talent - from director Trevor Nunn, stage designer John Napier, and costume designer Anthony Powell, to a magnificent cast headed by Patti LuPone and Kevin Anderson. Through interviews with all the principals, George Perry sheds light on the show's complex production machinery and pays tribute to the creativity of the many people who have contributed to its extraordinary success. The book includes a scene-by-scene synopsis of the film, the complete libretto of the musical, and specially commissioned color photographs of the stage production.Sunset Boulevard: From Movie to Musical is the definitive account of a memorable Hollywood film classic and a superb record of a great stage musical.",

On 11 September 2001, the scale of this conflict changed dramatically. As in 1998, the terrorist group responsible for this devastating campaign was Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda, a loose network of extremists, many of whom are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their cause?the promotion of a militant form of Islam and the destruction of the West. Award-winning international journalist Jane Corbin reports from an unmuzzled European perspective and her account of Operation Anaconda and the U.S. assault on Tora Bora differs greatly from the highly varnished Pentagon and State Department versions. Based on a number of trips she has made to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the wake of September 11, and on dozens of interviews with key eyewitnesses, investigators, and intelligence officers in the region, Corbin shows that al-Qaeda have not been \"smoked out.\"",

Commenting upon much of the critical work on Picasso that has appeared over the years, Mailer's biography brings us closer to the young artist than we have ever been before. Much at the heart of Mailer's interpretation is Picasso's first great love, Fernande Olivier, with whom the artist lived for seven years - a period that included Picasso's most revolutionary works, from the explosive innovations of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon to the mysteries of Cubism itself. To understand Picasso in these years, Mailer argues, it is necessary to follow his relationship with the extraordinary Fernande, who is here given her own voice by way of excerpts from her candid memoirs, hitherto unpublished in English. Since this period also includes Picasso's friendships with Apollinaire and Gertrude Stein, the book evokes the charm and special character of bohemian life in Paris in the early 1900s.Closely integrated throughout the text are more than 250 illustrations, including black-and-white and color reproductions of Picasso's works (drawings, sketches, and major paintings), as well as pertinent photographs and contributory works by other artists.",

Lowe-Evans&#39;s  book explores the specific influence of this controversial debate on  Joyce&#39;s<br>works, from <i>Dubliners</i> to <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, as well as that of other key historical events such as the<br>Great Famine, the Malthusian doctrine, the international birth control movement, the Catholic<br>church, and postwar populationism. </p><p>As Michel Foucault observed, \"one of the great  innovations in techniques of power in the eighteenth century was the  emergence of &#39;population&#39; as an economic and political problem.\"  Similarly, Lowe-Evans examines Joyce&#39;s works as the product of countless rhetorical pressures and trends, including histories of Ireland, the <i>Irish Homestead,</i> and reports of the obscenity trial of Margaret Sanger.</p><p>Joyce once wrote his good friend Frank Budgen that the idea underlying the famous \"Oxen of the Sun\" chapter in <i>Ulysses</i>  (set in a maternity hospital) was \"the crime committed against  fecundity by sterilizing the act of coition.\" Drawing upon this and  numerous other instances, Lowe-Evans demonstrates how Foucault&#39;s theory  of the deployment of sexuality is borne out both in Joyce&#39;s work and in  the debates that helped to produce it.</p><p>In <i>Crimes Against Fecundity</i>,  Lowe-Evans reveals new and fascinating aspect of this great writer\u00b7s  work, which will be of great interest not only to literary theorists and  Joyceans but to literary scholars in general.</p>",

        "Description": "At last the mystery is solved . . .The Turin Shroud. To many it is the holiest of Christianity's holy relics. The winding sheet of Christ. The cloth that his crucified body was wrapped in as he lay in the tomb, and which miraculously bears his image.To millions it has been a mystery whose origin has been debated for hundreds of years. Is the Turin Shroud the winding sheet of Christ? Is it his image that appears on the cloth, and, if so, how did it come to appear there? How does one reconcile the carbon dating which shows the shroud to have originated around the fourteenth century? Or is the cloth a carefully constructed fraud? A fraud so ingeniously conceived that its creation has baffled experts from around the world.Now, the true, shocking story of the Turin Shroud is revealed. In an investigation that is part detective story, part historical research and part scientific experiment, Turin Shroud reveals that the creator of the Shroud, and the man whose image appears on it, was actually one of the most brilliant and creative men the world has ever known - Leonardo da Vinci. Turin Shroud also shows the ingenious and revolutionary technique da Vinci used to create the image, making the Shroud the world's first photograph.But the image on the Shroud is only half the story. As the authors delve deep into the Shroud's mysterious history, they reveal its connection to one of the world's most secret societies. A powerful organization that has claimed as members some of the most important figures in European history and will stop at nothing to protect the Shroud.Turin Shroud finally uncovers the secrets behind this great mystery and challenges some of the most fundamental views about our past, not only religious and artistic but also technological.",

        "Description": "For this outstanding contemporary Glasgow novel, Louise Welsh\u00a0won the Saltire First Book of The Year Award and\u00a0the Crime Writers' Association Creasey Dagger, was\u00a0chosen as one of Britain's Best First Novelists by the Guardian, and was nominated for the Orange Prize for Fiction\u00a0Rilke, The Cutting Room's charismatic protagonist,\u00a0is eccentric, witty, and frequently outrageous. An auctioneer by profession, he is an acknowledged expert in antiques but also considers himself something of an expert in many other fields. When he\u00a0comes upon a hidden collection of graphically violent erotic photographs, he feels compelled to unearth more about the deceased owner who coveted them. What follows is a compulsive journey of discovery, decadence, and deviousness, steered in part by Rilke's gay promiscuity and inquisitive nature. Louise Welsh's writing is stylish and captivating; she combines aspects of a detective story with shades of the gothic in a colorful Glasgow ranging from the genteel suburbs to a transvestite club, auction house to the bookies, pub, and porn shop. The result is a page-turning, darkly atmosopheric, and deliciously original debut.",

The Bhagwan preached an eclectic doctrine of Eastern mysticism, chaotic therapy, and sexual freedom, and enjoyed inhaling laughing gas, preaching from a dentist's chair, and collecting Rolls Royces. Tim and his mother were given Sanskrit names, dressed entirely in orange, and encouraged to surrender themselves into their new family. While his mother worked tirelessly for the cause, Tim-or Yogesh, as he was now called-lived a life of well-meaning but woefully misguided neglect in various communes in England, Oregon, India, and Germany.In 1985 the movement collapsed amid allegations of mass poisonings, attempted murder, and tax evasion, and Yogesh was once again Tim. In this extraordinary memoir, Tim Guest chronicles the heartbreaking experience of being left alone on earth while his mother hunted heaven.",

Ralph Berton was privileged enough to have been a fan&#151;and younger brother of Bix's drummer&#151;just as Beiderbecke's genius was flowering, before he died in 1931 at age twenty-eight. Listening from behind the piano, tagging along to honky-tonks and jam sessions, Berton heard some of the most extraordinary music of the century, and he brings Bix and his era alive with a remarkable combination of the excitement of youth and the perspective of the five decades that followed&#151;decades that confirmed Bix's place in the pantheon of jazz.",

What a worthy performance, he thinks, murdering a man while a million people watch.The other is Kathleen Mallory. Once a feral child, loose on the city streets she is now a New York City policewoman and not much changed: a tall young woman with green eyes and a ferocious inner compass of right and wrong. For her, the death is too dramatic, too showy, and she is convinced that there will be another one - this perp loves spectacle. But even she cannot predict the spectacular chain of events that has already been set in motion, or the profoundly disturbing consequences it will have for those she holds most dear. For misdirection is the heart of magic. The lady never really gets sawed in half, does she?So why is there so much blood?",

        "Description": "Elizabeth Benedict's last novel, The Beginner's Book of Dreams, was hailed by Anne Tyler as \"a wonderful book ... complex, fascinating ... a joy to read\" (Chicago Tribune). Her new novel, Safe Conduct, is a harrowing exploration of trust and deception between men and women in the midst of the Cold War and at the heart of a marriage.Filmmaker Kate Lurie and her new husband, Eli MacKenzie, stop in Brussels, en route to Istanbul to finish making a movie, when out of Mac's past comes Lida, a stunning, determined Russian woman with whom he had an illicit affair while a diplomat in Leningrad fifteen years earlier. Lida's surprise appearance following the collapse of the Soviet empire, her shocking revelations about her relationship with Mac, and her brazen pursuit of him force Kate to confront the truth about her marriage, herself, and her husband's lost son.Kate narrates the story with a filmmaker's sharp eye and the intriguing sensibility of a cool headed, strong-willed woman whose confidence is slowly unraveled by Lida's familiarity and her husband's increasing distance. An exquisitely choreographed novel about first passion and missing children, about the complex burdens of love, lust, and memory, Safe Conduct confirms Elizabeth Benedict's reputation as a brilliant portraitist of broken families and \"an enormously talented writer\" (Philadelphia Inquirer).",

        "Authors": "By Vanden Heuvel, Katrina (EDT)",
        "Description": "?On Tuesday morning, a piece was torn out of our world. A patch of blue sky that should not have been there opened up in the New York skyline?. Our city was changed forever. Our country was changed forever. Our world was changed forever.\u201d So wrote Jonathan Schell in the first issue of The Nation magazine following September 11, 2001. In A Just Response, some of the most respected figures on the progressive left analyze the causes and consequences of this new American wound in a series of thoughtful, informed, and provocative essays. Selected from The Nation and other sources, these articles counter the bombast and jingoism of so much of the media coverage since September 11?while providing informed analysis, provocative commentary, and reasoned debates. The writers in these pages speak out against ?Fascism with an Islamic face,\u201d jingoism, and the undermining of civil rights, address the confusion between dissent and treason, and articulate a vision of a just response to terrorism. Others reflect on an interview with Osama bin Laden, the concept of ?Blowback\u201d?modern technological society turned unwittingly against itself?and the American right wing\u2019s exploitation of a national emergency to further its political agenda. Also included are dispatches from other countries around the world, brief background histories of bin Laden\u2019s origins, the roots of fundamentalism, asymmetrical warfare, and a heated exchange between Noam Chomsky and Christopher Hitchens.",

By focusing on its roots and branchings, Palmer charts rock's ongoing developmental processes, showing how its many tributaries - from blues and gospel to reggae, punk, and rap - converge and connect to create the most insightful history of rock and roll ever written.",
