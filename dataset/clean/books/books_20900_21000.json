From the several sorts of chocolate connoisseur-including the gourmoo, who eats only milk chocolate-to the several shapes of chocolate itself (bunny, kiss, glove compartment bar), Boynton's apologia for chocolate misses nothing.

Plus, how to grow chocolate at home, a foolproof method for determining if chocolate is in season (does the name of the month contain the letter A, E, or U?), and a recipe for Hippo Pot de Mousse.   \"Fourteen out of ten people like chocolate,\" says the artist.

Must relish sixteen-hour shifts with a deliberately nap-deprived preschooler. Must love getting thrown up on, literally and figuratively, by everyone in his family. Must enjoy the delicious anticipation of ridiculously erratic pay. Mostly, must love being treated like fungus found growing out of employers Herm\u00e8s bag. Those who take it personally need not apply.Who wouldn't want this job? Struggling to graduate from NYU and afford her microscopic studio apartment, Nanny takes a position caring for the only son of the wealthy X family. She rapidly learns the insane amount of juggling involved to ensure that a Park Avenue wife who doesn't work, cook, clean, or raise her own child has a smooth day. When the Xs' marriage begins to disintegrate, Nanny ends up involved way beyond the bounds of human decency or good taste. Her tenure with the X family becomes a nearly impossible mission to maintain the mental health of their four-year-old, her own integrity and, most importantly, her sense of humor. Over nine tense months, Mrs. X and Nanny perform the age-old dance of decorum and power as they test the limits of modern-day servitude. Written by two former nannies, The Nanny Diaries deftly punctures the glamour of Manhattan's upper class.",

        "Description": "\"I thought I knew Terry McAuliffe as well as anyone, but this time he surprised even me.  Who knew Terry could sit still long enough to give us a book this good? What a Party! is a must-read for all of us who love politics, believe in public service, and know that laughter is often the best survival strategy.\" --President Bill Clinton \"No one knows more about American politics than Terry McAuliffe. He givesus some remarkable insights and knows how to make his accounts both humorousand informative.\" --President Jimmy Carter \"I've often said Terry's energy could light up a city, and readers of this book will know why. Terry's excitement for politics--and life--is evident on every page.\"  --Senator Hillary Clinton     For more than twenty-five years, Terry McAuliffe has been at the epicenter of American politics.  Just out of Catholic University in Washington, Terry took a position with the Carter-Mondale campaign and quickly became one of the campaign's chief fund-raisers--and hasn't looked back since. The list of Terry\u00b4s former mentors, friends, and close associates in the nation's capital reads like a who's who of legendary Democrats: Tip O'Neill. Jimmy Carter. Dick Gephardt. Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton. Al Gore. The list goes on and on. Terry has fought hard for the Democratic Party his entire life and, as Bill Clinton reveals here for the first time, he was the first one in the party to see opportunity in the Republican gains in the 1994 Congressional elections.       Without question the most successful fund-raiser in political history, Terry established himself as a heavyweight Democratic strategist and leader who was George W. Bush\u00b4s most vocal and persistent critic during the first four years of the Bush 43 presidency. He earned rave reviews even from former critics for his groundbreaking work as chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2001 to 2005, pulling the DNC out of debt for the first time in its history.  Terry has served as a confidant and adviser to President Clinton and countless presidential candidates, a mediator among party leaders, the chairman of a national convention and presidential inaugural, and a forceful spokesman for the party--all without losing his reputation as a colorful, fun-loving character liked and respected even by his Republican adversaries.       What a Party! is a fascinating, hilarious, and provocative look at the life of one of Washington's legendary figures. From wrestling an alligator to running the Democratic National Committee to his friendship with President Clinton, Terry McAuliffe's wonderful memoir covers it all and is, without doubt, the political book of the year.",

Bejesus, isn't America a great and wonderful country?\" His older brother Frank's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, Angela's Ashes, took its somber tone from the bleak atmosphere of those slums, while Malachy's boisterous recollections are fueled by his zestful appreciation for the opportunities and oddities of his native land.He and Frank were born in Brooklyn, moved with their parents to Ireland as children, then returned to the States as adults. This book covers the decade 1952-63, when Malachy roistered across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, but spent most of his time in New York City. There his ready wit and quick tongue won him an acting job with the Irish Players, a semiregular stint onThe Tonight Show hosted by Jack Paar, and friendships with some well-heeled, well-born types who shared his fondness for saloon life and bankrolled him in an East Side saloon that may have been the first singles bar. He chronicles those events--and many others--with back-slapping bonhomie.Although McCourt acknowledges the personal demons that pursued him from his poverty-stricken childhood and destroyed his first marriage, this is on the whole an exuberant autobiography that pays tribute to the joys of a freewheeling life.",

        "Authors": "By Alvarez, R. Michael and Hall, Thad E.",
        "Description": "Whether responding to a CNN.com survey or voting for the NFL All-Pro team, computer users are becoming more and more comfortable with Internet polls. Computer use in the United States continues to grow&#151;more than half of all American households now have a personal computer. The next question, then, becomes obvious. Should Americans be able to use the Internet in the most important polls of all?     Some advocates of Internet voting argue that Americans are well suited to casting their ballots online in political elections. They are eager to make use of new technology, and they have relatively broad access to the Internet. Voting would become easier for people stuck at home, at the office, or on the road. Internet voting might encourage greater political participation among young adults, a group that stays away from the polling place in droves. It would hold special appeal for military personnel overseas, whose ability to vote is a growing concern. There are serious concerns, however, regarding computer security and voter fraud, unequal Internet access across socioeconomic lines (the \"digital divide\"), and the civic consequences of moving elections away from schools and other polling places and into private homes and offices. After all, showing up to vote is the most public civic activity many Americans engage in, and it is often their only overt participation in the democratic process.    In Point, Click, and Vote, voting experts Michael Alvarez and Thad Hall make a strong case for greater experimentation with Internet voting. In their words, \"There is no way to know whether any argument regarding Internet voting is accurate unless real Internet voting systems are tested, and they should be tested in small-scale, scientific trials so that their successes and failures can be evaluated.\" In other words, you never know until you try, and it's time to try harder.    The authors offer a realistic plan for putting pilot remote Internet voting programs into effect nationwide. Such programs would allow U.S. voters in selected areas to cast their ballots over any Internet connection; they would not even need to leave home. If these pilot programs are successful, the next step is to consider how they might be implemented on a larger scale in future elections.",

        "Description": "Created for the occasion of his twenty-fifth anniversary as Pope, John Paul II: A Light for the World provides a celebration in photographs and word of the courageous pastor who guides more than one billion Catholics and has made his mark on history the world over. John Paul II: A Light for the World features over 140 photographs - many of which seldom have been seen outside the Vatican - by official Vatican photographers who have captured the Pope's remarkable life and ministry for two and a half decades. These photographs are accompanied by selections from the Pope's own speeches and writings as well as essays and personal reflections by scholars and friends that provide insight into the public and private person of Pope John Paul II.Organized into three sections - Pastor, Pilgrim, Prophet - more than forty essays by staff of the United States Conference of Catholic bishops explore the depth and breadth of the themes central to John Paul's papacy, while nearly thirty personal reflections by cardinals, bishops, and others who have had personal encounters with the Pope reveal his profoundly human, and often humorous, side.The book opens with a personal greeting from Angelo Cardinal Sodano, Vatican Secretary of State; a foreword by Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations; an introduction by Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the USCCB; and a historical sketch by John Thavis, Rome bureau chief for the Catholic News Service. Also featured in the volume is a comprehensive essential resources section that includes a history of the Pope's life and ministry; lists of canonizations and beatifications; his world travels, including visits to the United States; summaries of all his encyclicals, major Apostolic Constitutions, Exhortations, and Letters; and a complete chronological listing of his key papal writings. A glossary of terms and an index are also included. This book is an invaluable resource and keepsake for Catholics, spiritual seekers, those interested in history, and anyone who has been moved by the witness and hopeful message of John Paul II.",

        "Description": "American business, economics, and society are changing at the speed of light. On the eve of the twenty-first century, the pressure is on, and managers need to learn faster, think smarter, and free themselves from confining assumptions and old mindsets. Bestselling author and business lecturer Jennifer James offers a dynamic new way of achieving these goals in Thinking in the Future Tense, explaining the skills necessary to break free from old mindsets, to leap abysses of change, and to exploit new business trends, products, and services.People in business today who hope to seize the competitive advantage tomorrow must learn to \"think in the future tense\": to identify the changes taking place around them, to interpret their meaning, and to benefit accordingly. Managers who do not learn the skills needed to separate old cultural beliefs from new realities will not survive the next all-too-inevitable reorganization. Companies that are not flexible and fast enough to exploit constantly evolving markets will soon be out of business. Survival skills now require perspective (the ability to identify the important changes), energy (the ability to do more with less), and a \"menagerie\" mind (the ability to create new patterns). Perceptive, stimulating, and packed with penetrating insights, Thinking in the Future Tense makes it possible to understand and apply the skills that will be crucial to success in the twenty-first century.",

In the text Lady Bird Johnson, in collaboration with an eminent horticulturist, makes a compelling argument for the preservation and proliferation of the natural beauty of our country's native flora. Since her childhood Mrs. Johnson has loved wildflowers, and on her seventieth birthday she founded a research center, now known as the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, with the aim of encouraging the use of more native plants and flowers in gardens and landscaping. This book includes a foreword by Mrs. Johnson, as well as up-to-date information about the Center.The book also deals with such practical matters as how to establish your own wildflower meadow and where to get the seeds if you need them.

From boyhood, the prince was trained by the finest scholars and mightiest soldiers to attain extraordinary strength of body and spirit. A descendant of Heracles and Achilles, Alexander aimed to surpass his ancestors' heroism and honor, and his chosen companions strove to be worthy to share his godlike fate.  Even as a youth, Alexander's deeds were unequaled. In a single day, he tamed the fierce steed Bucephalus. In his first battle, his troops defeated the invincible Sacred Band. And as he grew to manhood, surrounded by deadly plots and intrigue, his friends pledged to follow him to the ends of the world.

When the knife breaks, do you think Mrs. Coulter is aware of her influence on Will? Are there any connections between Mrs. Coulter and Will's mother? 3. In each book of the His Dark Materials trilogy, a special device (such as the alethiometer, the subtle knife, or the amber spyglass) is introduced in connection with the pursuit of Dust. What are the different properties of each instrument? How does each instrument reflect the personality of the person that uses it (i.e., Lyra, Will, and Dr. Malone)? 4. When asked to mend the subtle knife, Iorek is hesitant: 'Sometimes a tool may have other uses that you don't know. Sometimes in doing what you intend you also do what the knife intends, without knowing.' What do you think the knife's intentions are? Based on these intentions, who do you think created the knife and for what purpose? 5. By the end of The Amber Spyglass , what similiarites can you see between Lyra and Mrs. Coulter? How is Lyra's storytelling different from Mrs. Coulter's lying? 6. In The Amber Spyglass , Mrs. Coulter goes through a dramatic transformation as her maternal feelings for Lyra break through to the surface. What is the catalyst for this change?",

Let me sit down for a moment, and then I'll be on my way. Speaking of ways, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract.\"A tesseract (in case the reader doesn't know) is a wrinkle in time. To tell more would rob the reader of the enjoyment of Miss L'Engle's unusual book. A Wrinkle in Time, winner of the Newbery Medal in 1963, is the story of the adventures in space and time of Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe (athlete, student, and one of the most popular boys in high school). They are in search of Meg's father, a scientist who disappeared while engaged in secret work for the government on the tesseract problem.A Wrinkle in Time is the winner of the 1963 Newbery Medal. It is the first book in The Time Quintet, which consists of A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters, and An Acceptable Time.
