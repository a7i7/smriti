But when Bo's temper flares out of control and he's sentenced to three years of manual labor, he's not so down with the law anymore.   Bo's forced to live and work in a factory in the Canadian tundra. The warden running the place is totally out of his mind, and cares little for his inmates' safety. Bo will have to decide what's worse: a society that locks people up for road rage, or a prison where the wrong move could make you polar bear food.",

Covering everything from kitsch cars to sleek roadsters in his inimitable style, he unveils a fabulous collection of over 150 classic cars. An encyclopedia of true classics. With a keen eye for performance and styling, Quentin Wilson has chosen a superb line-up of cars, mouthwateringly photographed, and furnished with all the facts and figures you'll ever need. From the curvaceous E-type to the legendary GT40, Wilson dishes up the detail on classic cars from all over the world. You can cruise through alphabetically arranged profiles, technical specifications, and construction data right down to every last spoked wheel and swing half-axle. High-performance history. Wilson provides an engaging history of these coveted classics, with everything from the retro appeal of America's \"muscle cars\" -- Mustangs, Corvettes, and Firebirds--to the advent of classic car auctions, and the huge price swings that accompanied them. Style trends and engineering developments are also covered in Wilson's usual entertaining fashion. A series of illustrated sketches neatly capture the famous and infamous personalities of the car world. This is essential reading for anyone who, like the author, can't resist engines that sound \"like someone tearing sheets.\"",

To find the answer, this religious Israeli Jew began a two-year exploration to discover a common language with his Christian and Muslim neighbors. He followed their holiday cycles, befriended Christian monastics and Islamic mystics, and joined them in prayer in monasteries and mosques in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. At the Entrance to the Garden of Eden traces that remarkable spiritual journey. Halevi candidly reveals how he fought to reconcile his own fears and anger as a Jew to relate to Christians and Muslims as fellow spiritual seekers. He chronicles the difficulty of overcoming multiple obstacles\u2014theological, political, historical, and psychological\u2014that separate believers of the three monotheistic faiths. And he introduces a diverse range of people attempting to reconcile the dichotomous heart of this sacred place\u2014a struggle central to Israel, but which resonates for us all.",
