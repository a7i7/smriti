        "Authors": "By Clairmont, Patsy",
        "Description": "Sometimes if we try we can disconnect from tough problems around us, but eventually the network of fractures spreads to our front doors when a husband walks out, a loved-one is arrested, a friend betrays us, a church splits, a job is terminated, a diagnosis is bad, or a financial picture worsens. Suddenly with no place to hide from the reality we realize life is all cracked up. Through the lens of our pain everything seems broken, bruised, and battered. But, as best-selling author Patsy Clairmont points out, there's a redeemer of our pain--Jesus. The Redeemer of the broken and discarded who mends our hearts, and even gives us a reason to laugh again.Telling inspirational stories of women's brokenness and healing, with tenderness and her trademark humor, Patsy Clairmont helps us realize that we're not alone in our struggles. Jesus buoys our spirits and refreshes our tired minds. As Patsy says, \"life is so much easier to bear when its shared.'",

        "Title": "Everest: Summit of Achievement",
        "Authors": "By Royal Geographic Society, Venables, Stephen (EDT), and Hillary, Edmund, Sir (FRW)",
        "Description": "Everest: Summit Of Achievement On 29 May 1953, New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay stood atop the highest mountain in the world, where no one had ever stood before. This magnificent volume celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of their historic climb and chronicles the history of Everest exploration from the early years of the twentieth century to the present. It is the first and only book on the subject to benefit from complete access to the Royal Geographical Society's astonishingly rich collection of photographs, documents, and artifacts.  Painstakingly selected from over 20,000 subjects, more than 400 photographs -- many never before published -- record the surveying, planning, reconnaissance expeditions, and ascents that the Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club jointly launched -- beginning in 1921 and culminating in Hillary and Norgay's landmark feat. Among the memorable photographs reproduced here are the first aerial views of Mount Everest; the last known photograph of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, who perished soon afterward on the slopes of Everest; Hillary's iconic photograph of Tenzing Norgay standing triumphant on Everest's summit; images showing the daily experience of expedition members along with the dangers they faced; portraits of the life and customs of Sherpas and the other Tibetan peoples; and the spectacular beauty of the Everest massif itself.  These unique and breathtaking images are prefaced by Sir Edmund Hillary and HisHoliness the Dalai Lama, and are accompanied by chapters written by renowned mountaineer Stephen Venables; the well-known journalist and mountain climber Ed Douglas; Judy and Tashi Tenzing, grandson of Norgay; and noted historian John Keay.  The result is a work of lasting significance that captures as never before the sense of discovery, excitement, achievement, and exhilaration experienced over the years by those who are brave and determined enough to challenge the world's greatest mountain.",

        "Description": "In this heartfelt, incisive novel, Danielle Steel celebrates the virtues of unconventional beauty while exploring deeply resonant issues of weight, self-image, sisterhood, and family.  \u00a0 BIG GIRL \u00a0 A chubby little girl with ordinary looks, Victoria Dawson has always felt out of place in her family, especially in body-conscious L.A. While her parents and sister can eat anything and not gain an ounce, Victoria must watch everything she eats, as well as endure her father\u2019s belittling comments about her body and see her academic achievements go unacknowledged. Ice cream and oversized helpings of all the wrong foods give her comfort, but only briefly. The one thing she knows is that she has to get away from home, and after college in Chicago, she moves to New York City. Landing her dream job as a high school teacher, Victoria loves working with her students and wages war on her weight at the gym. Despite tension with her parents, Victoria remains close to her younger sister, Grace. Though they couldn\u2019t be more different in looks, they love each other unconditionally. So when Grace announces her engagement to a man who is an exact replica of their narcissistic father, Victoria worries about her sister\u2019s future happiness, and with no man of her own, she feels like a failure once again. As the wedding draws near, a chance encounter, a deeply upsetting betrayal, and a family confrontation lead to a turning point. Behind Victoria is a lifetime of hurt and neglect she has tried to forget. Ahead is a challenge and a risk: to accept herself as she is, celebrate it, and claim the victories she has fought so hard for and deserves. Big girl or not, she is terrific and discovers that herself.",

In The Light in the City, the Parshalls help readers understand the biblical basis for the need for Christians to be actively involved in the formation of public policy.  Issues addressed in this book are as current as tabloid headlines.  The Light in the City not only gives a biblical and historical basis for Christian involvement, but it also provides practical strategies and personal testimonies of encouragement.",

        "Title": "Faithful Travelers: A Father, His Daughter, A Fly-fishing Journey of the Heart",
        "Authors": "By Dodson, James",
        "Description": "In Final Rounds, James Dodson told the poignant story of the golf trip of a lifetime with his terminally ill father. Now, armed with a fly-fishing rod and reel, he embarks with his seven-year-old daughter on an equally memorable journey across America in search of clear-running streams, swift elusive fish, and the eternal truths that only nature can provide.It has been said that life is what happens while you're waiting to go fishing. Only weeks after his eleven-year marriage abruptly ended in an amicable divorce, James Dodson decided to go on a fly-fishing pilgrimage west. His goal: to heal his wounded spirit and explain as best he could the vagaries of life and love to his beautiful, precocious seven-year-old daughter, Maggie.With his beat-up truck, Old Blue, and his aging retriever, Amos, Dodson and Maggie travel without plans or reservations, following where the spirit--and the lure of America's mighty rivers--leads them, on their way to one of America's grandest treasures: Yellowstone National Park. On the way, Dodson discovers a great deal about fishing, about America, and about the special relationship that exists only between a father and daughter. They travel from the Adirondacks, once a fly-angler's haven, to the mist-shrouded Niagara Falls. From the Michigan lakes where Ernest Hemingway roamed as a boy to small-town county fairs. From the majesty of Mount Rushmore to the mysticism of Harney's Peak, where Black Elk had his legendary visions, to finally the fly-fisherman's paradise of the San Juan River. Together father and daughter are bound by a tie as resilient and unpredictable as a fly-fisherman's line. For as the emotional waters in which they fish become ever more turbulent, Maggie's unspoken feelings of grief, anger, and blame begin to surface--a depth of hurt that forces Dodson to face his own unacknowledged pain and, worse, leaves him feeling helpless to make everything all right in his daughter's life again. Yet if fly-fishing has taught James Dodson anything, it is the rewards of patience, of following the wisdom of the course of the stream, the unexpected revelations reflected in still pools, and, of course, an abiding belief in plain dumb luck. With a little of each, these faithful travelers will find their way home again.Literate, honest, and deeply observant, Faithful Travelers is a beautiful meditation on the bond between parent and child and the nature of love and loss. In Faithful Travelers, James Dodson proves that sometimes life isn't what happens while you're waiting to go fishing: sometimes it happens while you're there.",

The author of the bestselling Practical Feng Shui shows you how to hone those instincts with detailed knowledge about face shape, hairlines, eyebrows and eyes, cheeks and smile, noses, lips, ears, chins, and jowls. Each feature is extensively discussed, with ample close-up photos that visually clarify every point. Identify the three \"facial zones\" that allow you to access character quickly. Then see how to use this wisdom to improve everything from business meetings to social situations to your personal life. Communicate more persuasively, enhance decision-making, see yourself as others see you, choose the perfect partner, enjoy better relationships, develop your parenting ability, make wiser career choices, work more efficiently, and even ward off ill health.
