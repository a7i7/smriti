        "Description": "Given our history, this father and this son might well have gone completely separate ways ... And only in becoming a father did I even begin to understand what it meant, what it was, what would be required of me, and who I was/am within that identity, father.Pastor, author, and father Walter Wangerin Jr., along with his adopted son, Matthew, tell the story of their own lifelong relationship and how they survived times when brokenness and bitterness seemed inevitable. It is the story of Matthew's desperate search for independence and his father's own search for authentic fatherhood.This is a book of deep emotion and serious meditation about broken lives and redemption. Father and Son weaves together each writer's personal story and shows:how earthly fathers and sons are shaped by a Creator's relationship with his creation how within the human experience of parenting we discover insights into the spiritual nature of home, family, and eternity itself As in As for Me and My House, Mourning into Dancing, and Little Lamb, Who Made Thee? Walter Wangerin Jr. develops a series of insights about family, which readers can apply to their own lives. And these insights gain added resonance from the words of Matthew Aaron Wangerin.Together, father and son have written a book that must be experienced as well as read. It's a book parents will want to bring their lives to, not just their attention. Father and Son is the story of all of us, for we are all wayward children in need of a loving, patient father.",

        "Description": "A revised and updated version of the definitive peanut allergy book.Since the publication of The Peanut Allergy Answer Book in May 2001, there has been much additional research published in the field of peanut allergy and anaphylaxis in medical literature. This research includes new diagnostic tests, new vaccines and therapies, and new information on the history of peanut allergy. In addition, there has also been a great increase in public awareness of the societal impact of peanut allergy, such as in schools and other child-care facilities, in restaurants, and in the food and restaurant industry. This attention has led to the publication of guidelines for schools in the management of food allergies and anaphylaxis, to legislation such as the Food Allergen Labeling Consumer Protection Act of 2006, and proposed legislation for restaurant guidelines for food-allergic consumers. The incidence of peanut allergy has doubled in the past five years and continues to increase so the impact of this medical problem, particularly in young children, is enormous.The Peanut Allergy Answer Book, 2nd Edition, contains 50% of new and revised material, including a new foreword and introduction, as well as new chapters such as, \"Why has peanut allergy increased so much in the past 5-10 years?\u201d; \u201cWhat is the difference between being peanut-sensitive and peanut-allergic?\u201d; \u201cWhat is the Hygiene Hypothesis?\u201d; and \u201cCan skin contact cause an anaphylactic reaction?\u201d",

Thrown together to organize a fundraiser for their failing private school and bonded by loneliness, they begin an affair that at first thrills, then corrupts each of them. Judy sees in Zach the elements of a young man she loved as a child, but what Zach does not realize is that their relationship is&#151;for Judy&#151;only the latest in a lifetime of disturbing secrets.Rebecca Coleman&#39;s manuscript for The Kingdom of Childhood was a semifinalist in the 2010 Amazon Breakthrough Novel Competition. An emotionally tense, increasingly chilling work of fiction set in the controversial Waldorf school community, it is equal parts enchanting and unsettling and is sure to be a much-discussed and much-debated novel.",

        "Description": "On the anniversary of a life-shattering event, George Webb, a former policeman turned private detective, revisits the catastrophes of his past and reaffirms the extraordinary direction of his future. Two years before, an assignment to follow a strayed husband and his mistress appeared simple enough, but this routine job left George a transformed man.Suspenseful, moving, and hailed by critics as a detective story unlike any other, The Light of Day is a gripping tale of murder and redemption, as well as a bold exploration of love and self-discovery. This powerful novel signals yet another groundbreaking achievement from Graham Swift, the author of the Booker Prize-winning novel Last Orders.",

Having participated in a spectacular betrayal in Los Angeles, the giant, silent Arthur Key drifts into work as a carpenter in southern Idaho. Here he is hired, along with the shiftless and charming Ronnie Panelli, to build a stunt ramp beside a cavernous void. The two will be led by Darwin Gallegos, the foreman of the local ranch who is filled with a primeval rage at God, at man, at life. As they endeavor upon this simple, grand project, the three reveal themselves in cautiously resonant, profound ways. And in a voice of striking intimacy and grace, Carlson's novel reveals itself as a story of biblical, almost spiritual force. A bellwether return from one of our greatest craftsmen, Five Skies is sure to be one of the most praised and cherished novels of the year.",

        "Description": "Looking for real hope and change?The man Hardball host Chris Matthews calls \u201cthe legendary R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr.\u201d has done it again. Tyrrell, author of such tours de force as New York Times bestseller Boy Clinton: The Political Biography, The Liberal Crack-Up, and The Conservative Crack-Up, serves up an insightful and delightful exploration of the past, present, and future of American conservatism, or what he terms, \u201cAmerica\u2019s longest dying political philosophy.\u201d And its future is bright.Tyrrell begins with a sparkling distillation of conservative theory and history, complete with personal anecdotes from his decades in the movement, inspired by its luminaries, bored by its dim bulbs. He explains the nature of the conservative temperament\u2014its \u201cpolitical libido\u201d\u2014and how it plays out in today\u2019s curious political culture; examines the vital role of a true \u201cpolitical culture\u201d and solidarity in opposing the left and then offers a comprehensive agenda for the future of the movement that every political player on both the right and the left will have to read to grapple with in 2010 and 2012.Tyrrell also considers American Liberalism\u2014its excesses, quirks, and near suicidal instinct. Far from offering mere indictment, however, Tyrrell also delivers a unique perspective on Liberalism\u2019s strengths, such as its intramural ecumenism and rare ability to rally around shared causes, explaining how conservatives could learn and profit from the example.It goes without saying that through it all Tyrrell\u2019s famous humor crackles and lifts the spirit. Conservatives looking for perspective on the current scene, a richer understanding of their shared past, and hope for the future will find After the Hangover as refreshing as it is restorative.\u00a0PREVIOUS ACCLAIM\u201cThe legendary R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr.\u201d ?CHRIS MATTHEWS\u201cNo columnist, no author, has had a greater influence upon the course of American political history over the past decade than that ribald contrarian, R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr. Even the slain giants die laughing.\u201d ?TOM WOLFE\u201cWashington would not be the same without Bob Tyrrell and neither would the American conservative movement. While dilettantes come and go, the relentless and irrepressible Tyrrell is forever.\u201d ?DAILY TELEGRAPH (LONDON)\u201cTyrrell is the master of a particular form\u2014taking broken shards of silliness, deviance, hypocrisy, crime, and treason, shaping them into Erasmian examples of human folly, and doing so with style and flow.\u201d ?ARAM BAKSHIAN\u201cTyrrell alerts us to the dangers our political system faces . . . and he does it with the insight, wit, and style that mark him as a great American writer.\u201d ?BOB BARR\u201cR. Emmett Tyrrell Jr. has written a stimulating book which should cause many Americans to rethink positions they have taken in the debates of the past decade.\u201d ?HENRY KISSINGER\u201cFor a man I disagree with as much as Emmett Tyrrell . . . I must say that I enjoyed the sheer hell out of his book.\u201d ?NORMAN MAILER",

Organized in an easy-reference, A-Z format, Fish gives you the culinary lowdown on seventy kinds of fish and shellfish commonly found in American supermarkets and fish stores. Each entry describes how the fish is sold (fillets, steaks, whole, salted), other names it goes by, how the fish should look, and buying tips. Fish begins with general guidelines on how to store, prepare, and cook fish, whether sauteing, frying, grilling, or smoking, and you will find easy-to-follow illustrations of such important basics as how to gut and fillet a fish. Fish also includes up-to-the-minute information on the health benefits of fish in our diet. In addition, there are more than five hundred recipes and variations, all of which use low-fat, high-flavor ingredients to accent the intrinsic natures of the individual fish rather than mask them. And the vast majority of the recipes are ready in less than thirty minutes.",

        "Authors": "By Pearson, Diane",
        "Description": "In the style of Csardas and The Summer of the Barshinskeys, best-selling author Diane Pearson once again creates a cast of vibrant characters and places them in a dazzling, memorable locale for us to enjoy. Her writing has been called \"hauntingly beautiful\" and \"compelling\" by her reviewers and fans, and she is sure to add to her growing popularity with Voices of Summer, in which we visit the shimmering Alps and eavesdrop on the backstage affairs of the little country town of Hochhauser.This Austrian village was no different from any of the others nestled in the Alps, except for one thing - its operetta company. Dreamchild of Willi Zimmerman, the town's exuberant mayor, the company brought music and gaiety to Hochhauser's little theater. It wasn't Salzburg or Vienna, but it had charm and a certain faded elegance. It also had Karl Gesner.Gesner's voice and stage presence made him the matinee idol of the audiences. Unfortunately, this attractiveness did not extend to his personality. Offstage, Gesner was a monster. Each season it became harder and harder to find a soprano willing to appear opposite him, but each season, that was exactly what Franz Busacher, the director, had to do.When, in desperation, Busacher persuaded Therese Aschmann to return to the stage after nearly twenty years in obscurity, years of loneliness and pain, no one could have imagined it was to be the beginning of the most extraordinary season Hochhauser had ever seen - a season of angry scenes and magical transformations, both onstage and off. Above all, it was to be a season in which love blossomed, often in the most unlikely places. Voices of Summer is poignant, funny, romantic, and heartwarming - a gloriously satisfying read.",

        "Title": "The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Book for Digital Photographers",
        "Authors": "By Kelby, Scott",
        "Description": "Free Lightroom 1.1 update available. Simply visit peachpit.com/register to gain instant access.Scott Kelby, author of the world's #1 bestselling Photoshop book,\u00a0 The Photoshop Book for Digital Photographers, brings his same award-winning, step-by-step, plain-English style, look and feel to The Lightroom Book for Digital Photographers.   This groundbreaking new book doesn't just show you \"which sliders do what\" (every Lightroom book does that). This book takes you beyond that to reveal the secrets of the new digital photography workflow, and he does it using three simple, yet brilliant techniques that make this just an incredible learning tool:   #1) Throughout the book Scott shares his own personal settings and studio tested techniques he's developed using Lightroom for his own photography workflow since well before Adobe released even the first Beta version. He knows what really works, what doesn't, and he tells you flat out which tools to use, which to avoid, and why.   #2) The entire book is laid out in a real workflow order with everything step-by-step, so you can jump right in using Lightroom like a pro from the very start and sidestep a lot of productivity killing road blocks and time-wasting frustrations that might have tripped you up along the way.   #3) But what really sets this book apart from the rest, are the last two bonus chapters. This is where Scott visually answers his #1 \"most-asked\" Lightroom question, which is: \"Exactly what order am I supposed to do things in, and where does Photoshop fit in?\"   Scott teaches this in a manner we've never seen before in any book, by really showing every step of the entire process, from the initial shoot to the final prints. Both chapters start with an on-location photo shoot, including full details on the equipment, camera settings, and even the lighting techniques. You'll see it all as he takes the photos from each shoot (with you following right along using the very same images) all the way through the entire workflow process, to the final output of the 16x20\" prints for the client.\u00a0 Plus, because he incorporates Adobe Photoshop seamlessly right into this workflow, you'll also learn some of his latest Photoshop techniques for portrait and landscape photography, which takes this book to a whole new level.   It's the first, and only book to bring the whole process together in such a clear, concise, and visual way. Best all, it's taught in Scott's trademark plain-English style that has won him legions of Photoshop fans around the world, and made him the #1 bestselling author of all computer books across all Computing and Internet categories since 2004.   If you're one of those people who learns best by actually doing the projects yourself; who learns best without all the complicated technical explanations and confusing jargon, and if you really want to start using Lightroom today to unlock the productivity secrets of\u00a0 \"The new digital photography workflow,\"----there is no faster, more \"straight-to-the-point\" or more fun way to learn than this groundbreaking new book, and you are absolutely going to love it!",

It would seem a long way from his family-oriented Virginia theme park, Lordland, to a seat in the Senate, but The Reverend has been riding the high-speed rails of the nineties - television. His ticket to Washington comes courtesy of his right-wing Life Force organization, trained to disrupt abortion clinics and snare major coverage on the evening news. But The Reverend doesn't count on one day invading the privacy of Tom Bethany, Vietnam veteran, former college wrestler, and champion of the lost cause. When Bethany's married lover, Hope Edwards, reveals that she's pregnant by him, he leaves Boston to accompany her on a personal visit to an Arlington, Virginia, clinic. When they are forced to run a gauntlet of The Reverend's vitriolic supporters and intrusive news cameras, which wreak havoc on the emotional state of a teenage patient, Bethany is fighting mad. But when Life Force shows up on Hope's doorstep, and the young girl solves her problems by taking her own life, Bethany is determined to get even.The charismatic Reverend has recruited Archie Weider, the savviest politico in the business, to help him reach the Senate and meld the Word of God with the law of the land. Bethany's not fooled by this charade; he's preparing a full submission hold to put the brakes on the good Pastor's wheels. When Life Force christens him the \"spawn of Satan,\" a badge that Bethany sports with pride, he musters an ad hoc task force to convert The Reverend. Enlisted are Susan Freedman, a journalist who has seen a disturbing side of The Reverend and whose distaste for him grows with every media sound bite...teenage electronics whiz Roy Shipley, the only friend of the troubled young girl whose death has fueled Bethany's desire to even the score...and Wanda Vollmer, massage therapist and proprietress of Personal Leisure World, who harbors a very personal resentment of Life Force, and who jumps at the chance to assist Bethany in his crusade.As Bethany and his team conspire to topple The Reverend from his bully pulpit, they incite the wrath of a man intent upon serving both God and Mammon. In a city that rewards power over scruples, and convenience over faith, Bethany's got his own special brand of political persuasion, and a missionary zeal for the laying on of hands....",
