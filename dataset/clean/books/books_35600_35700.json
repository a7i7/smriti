But after she is chosen to marry the prince, life with the royal family is not the \"happily ever after\" that Ella imagined. Pitiless and cold, the royals try to mold her into their vision of a princess. Ella's life becomes a meaningless schedule of protocol, which she fears she will never grasp. And Prince Charming's beautiful face hides a vacant soul.Even as her life turns to misery, the stories persist that Ella's fairy godmother sent her to the ball: How else could the poor girl wear a beautiful gown, arrive in a coach, and dance in those glass slippers? But there is no fairy godmother to help Ella escape the deadening life of the castle. Can she do it on her own?Margaret Peterson Haddix's reconstruction of the Cinderella legend without the magic -- how a commoner could have married the prince -- is a story as richly fascinating as the classic tale.",

Efficient, professional, and without apology, Lily Mansfield is a hired assassin, working as a contract agent for the CIA. Her targets are the powerful and corrupt, those who can\u2019t be touched by the law. Now, after nineteen years of service, Lily has been drawn into a dangerous game that hasn\u2019t been sanctioned, seeking vengeance for her own reasons. Each move bolder than the next, she is compromising her superiors, drawing unwanted attention, and endangering her very life. Though stress and shock have made her feel somewhat invincible and a little cocky, Lily knows that she too can be taken out in an instant. And if it\u2019s her time, so be it. She intends to go down fighting.A CIA agent himself, Lucas Swain recognizes the signs of trauma in the line of fire. His orders: either bring her in or bring her down. Yet he too is drawn into the game with Lily Mansfield, dancing on a tightrope as he tries to avoid a major international incident while still battling a tenacious foe who is dogging their every step. Keeping laser focus on the task at hand while vigilantly watching her back, Mansfield never sees the lethal peril that lies directly in her path . . . and how loyalty has a price.Chock-full of the intrigue, breathless action, and sensuality that have made Linda Howard the master of romantic suspense, Kiss Me While I Sleep is a daring thriller of passion, sudden twists, and richly imagined characters who live and breathe in readers\u2019 hearts. It is the most gripping and complex novel of Linda Howard\u2019s career.",

A convicted killer will meet his end. Anne believes her five-year nightmare is over.Until, within days, a similar murder stuns the city, forcing Anne to face some disturbing questions.As the murderer stalks his next victims, creeping ever closer to her, Anne cannot help but feel an icy unease, a haunting sense of connection to these unspeakable crimes. And, relentlessly, she hears the eerie echo of the dead man's last words to her: \"Today won't end it. How will you feel, Anne? When I'm dead, and it all starts again, how will you feel?\"",

Mr. Givens leads you through the process of setting realistic goals for your future and demonstrates how to achieve those goals by using commonsense \"success strategies\" in response to those life events you identify as problems.SuperSelf gives you a toolbox of practical strategies that will guarantee success in any situation. You will learn how to win the game when you're playing in someone else's ballpark; create a blueprint for your life and put it into action; transform efficiency into effectiveness; control your time line; manage mundane details and eliminate interruption; extend your peak performance period; fight fatigue, fear, and stress; and become a victor instead of a victim.These strategies will enable you to achieve twice as much in half the time, literally doubling your personal effectiveness.

Now, SuperSelf makes it possible for anyone to learn the personal habits, the attitudes of mind, and the time-saving strategies that create success.",

Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness.  Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate\u2014a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister\u2014and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.  My Sister\u2019s Keeper examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child\u2019s life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you? Once again, in My Sister\u2019s Keeper, Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity.",

The Indianapolis News notes that a Deborah Knott book is \"more than just a mystery; it is a portrait of a place.\" The Houston Chronicle compares Maron's rich description of central North Carolina to the writings of Sarah Orne Jewett and Kate Chopin. And the Raleigh News & Observer gets it exactly right when it says that the series is \"like pecan pie. It leaves you wanting more.\"Now, in Shooting at Loons, we follow Judge Deborah Knott to the state's lush Crystal Coast, where expensive yachts ride at anchor...and murders wash in on the \"Down East\" tide.Asked to sit in for a hospitalized judge in gracious old Beaufort, Deborah hopes to spend a restful week at her cousin's nearby Harkers Island cottage; but her very first clamming expedition turns up the corpse of a well-known fisherman in the shallow waters. Discovering the body puts her right in the middle of the fight between the locals who have long made their living from the sea and the new tide of well-to-do \"dingbatters\": weekenders and land developers who view the coast as their personal playground and gold mine.Deborah soon realizes that the centuries-old way of life in this isolated corner of the South is as endangered as loons and sea turtles, and the fisherman's murder is clearly tied to the coming changes. On the bench and off, she can feel the rage and fear and greed these changes arouse.Even so, sipping her bourbon in the fresh salt air proves beneficial for Deborah's soul, and life at the beach takes a definite upswing when she meets a game warden who's hunting for loon poachers. Not until a second murder occurs and a lover from her past becomes a suspect does Deborah realize she's up to her own neck in intrigue - and dangerously close to a killer...",

        "Authors": "By Tada, Joni Eareckson and Estes, Steve",
        "Description": "It\u2019s easy to trust God when things are going our way and the world makes sense. But when suffering strikes--especially seemingly senseless suffering--we are filled with doubt and stunned by events spiraling beyond our control. In the midst of suffering, we often question the very foundation of our faith--our belief in the God who says he loves us.  Since our trust and obedience rest on God\u2019s character, the questions that life\u2019s tragedies force us to face are difficult, even frightening. Who is God? Can he really be trusted? What are his purposes in the face of suffering? If he can stop suffering, why doesn\u2019t he?  Joni Eareckson Tada, a woman who has lived in a wheelchair for more than thirty years, and Steve Estes, a pastor and one of Joni\u2019s closest friends, explore the answers. When God Weeps is not so much a book about suffering as it is about God. It tackles tough questions about heaven and hell, horrors and hardships, and why God allows suffering in this life.  Through a panoramic overview of what the Bible says about suffering, the authors make clear who God is, why he permits so much heartache and pain, and how it is we can trust him. With both a practical edge and heartfelt warmth, When God Weeps offers dependence on his love and mercy in spite of our doubts, fears, longings, and questions.  It\u2019s a message much needed. Despair and discouragement are rampant. At the same time, fewer people are able to balance God\u2019s purposes and his mercies. Instead, attempting to avoid tragedy and suffering, many Christians confuse simple formulas for faith. But where does that leave the family who loses a son on a military mission? Or the young mother who isn\u2019t healed of cancer? When God Weeps is for people like these . . . and for thousands more who need more -- much more -- than answers.",

In simple, practical, and biblical terms, LeRoy Eims revives the lost art of disciple making. He explains: - How the early church discipled new Christians - How to meet the basic needs of a growing Christian - How to spot and train potential workers - How to develop mature, godly leaders \"True growth takes time and tears and love and patience,\" Eims states. There is no instant maturity. This book examines the growth process in the life of a Christian and considers what nurture and guidance it takes to develop spiritually qualified workers in the church.",

        "Description": "HAVE AN UNEXPECTED ADVENTEngage your members with an Advent devotional resource different from any other they have seen. Expecting the Unexpected offers far more than a typical re-telling of the Nativity story. Instead, this daily devotional guide presents snapshots from throughout Jesus\u2019 life in which he persistently does the unexpected.His arrival came at an unexpected time for Mary & Joseph, and it began a lifetime pattern in which Jesus confounded his family, perplexed the religious leaders of his day, and baffled his own disciples. His followers did not expect his death & resurrection\u2026and, his second coming will occur at an unexpected time.For each day of Advent, this book offers reflections on: ___ Instances when Jesus did the unexpected___ Instances when we personally encounter\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the unexpected in our own livesThese daily devotions are presented in five chapters, for the 4 weeks of Advent, plus the week after Christmas. In addition to the author\u2019s comments, these brief devotions include \u2013ScripturesAppropriate lyrics from Charles Wesley hymnsImages for meditationReflective questionsPrayersThis private devotional resource can also serve as the basis of a group study during Advent.Going beyond the basic Advent story, Blair Meeks creatively uncovers the historical and theological meaning of Christ\u2019s birth, life, death, and reign of glory. This is an Advent journey viewed through a new set of lenses.Fear of terrorism, rumors of epidemic, the pressures of consumerism\u2026. Are today\u2019s anxieties shrinking your Christmas spirit, your sense of joy, your purpose, your song? This Advent, expect the unexpected. Reconnect with the Christmas story, the arrival of Christ\u2019s biblical message of hope and healing for this world.\u00a0 Expecting the Unexpected is a spiritual feast for mind and imagination.\u00a0From Expecting the Unexpected -- \"I often wonder how we can decorate our tree, haul out the nativity set, sing 'Away in a Manger' once or twice, pack it all away again, and think we have celebrated Christmas adequately,\" writes Meeks. \"The season holds so much more for us. \u2026God's work through Jesus Christ only begins in the manger. Our joy in God's gift of Jesus to us should be part of our lives every day.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -- Blair MeeksWith Meeks as your companion and guide, reclaim excitement and refreshment.\u00a0 Expect Christ\u2019s reign in your life \u2014 today.

The first and most important step is choosing ingredients wisely. For the Dinner Doctor, that means prepared foods, whether canned, frozen, jarred, dried, or fresh from the salad bar or deli counter. Then comes the doctoring.Jarred roasted red peppers are pur\u00e9ed with canned chicken broth and sour cream, and garnished with fresh chives for a memorable chilled soup for a summer dinner party. Bagged coleslaw mix is dressed up with nuts, bottle ranch dressing and pre-crumbled cheese for a Blue Cheese, Walnut, and Apple Slaw. Jars of marinara turn into Linguine with Red Clam Sauce (just add a can of clams, dry white wine, and parsley) or a zingy Saturday Night Fever Pasta\u2014with the help of black olive paste and capers. Even deli potato salad, as tasty as it often is, can take on a variety of personalities\u2014enhance it with crumbled cooked bacon, or prepared horseradish, or curry powder and chopped scallions and shredded carrots. And bland chicken tenders\u2014those saviors of quick cooking\u2014are reinvented as Chinese Chicken, Chicken Piccata, and Curried Chicken and Apple Stew.Making excellent use of slow cookers, embracing myriad shortcuts, boosting flavor and freshness with hundreds of ideas and quick touches, The Dinner Doctor brings all the joy of serving from-scratch meals into harried lives.",

Accused by some of harboring deep resentments against the church, Wills counters with a powerful statement of his Catholic faith.Wills begins with a reflection on his early experience of that faith as a child, and later as a Jesuit seminarian, revealing the importance of Catholicism in his own life. He goes on to challenge, in clear and forceful terms, the dogmatic claim that criticism or reform of the papacy is an assault on the faith itself. In a sweeping narrative covering two thousand years of church history, he reveals that the papacy, far from being an unchanging institution, has been transformed dramatically over the millennia and can be reimagined in the future. Wills ends with a moving meditation on the significance of the creed, the timeless core of the Catholic faith, which endures even as the institution of the church changes.Posing urgent questions for Catholic and non-Catholic readers alike, Wills argues for the continuing relevance of a papacy newly understood. He has already stirred up controversy about the failures of the church. Now, at a time when the selection of a new pope is imminent, he is sure to spark an equally heated conversation about its future.",
