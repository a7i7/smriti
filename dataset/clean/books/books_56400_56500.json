Before this night was over, someone was going to die from a bullet in Jesse's gun - one more death in a long, strange death trip. But Jesse would be married to this killing forever.Jesse stuffed the body of his victim into the chimney of an abandoned house before he fled Isthmus City that night. Then the city pulled him back - battered, bloodied, and stumbling wildly into the arms of an older man with bizarre tastes. In Isthmus City's gay community, Jesse found a home. Then he found a career and another side of himself. He became a cop.Burying years of rage, pain, and confusion into a custom-tailored, tight-fitting blue cotton uniform, he learned what it took to react under pressure, to match criminals with their crimes, even to pull the trigger on his 9mm Glock. He almost learned to forget about his violent past. Until he was called to a half-demolished crack house to investigate a grisly discovery: a skeleton in a chimney...",

        "Description": "Thousands of years in the future, all the northern hemisphere is buried under the ice and snow of a new Ice Age. At the southern end of a large landmass called Ifrik, two children of the Mahondi people, seven-year old Mara and her younger brother, Dann, are abducted from their home in the middle of the night. Raised as outsiders in a poor rural village, Mara and Dann learn to survive the hardships and dangers of a life threatened as much by an unforgiving climate and menacing animals as by a hostile community of Rock People. Eventually they join the great human migration North, away from the drought that is turning the southern land to dust, and in search of a place with enough water and food to support human life. Traveling across the continent, the siblings enter cities rife with crime, power struggles, and corruption, learning as much about human nature as about how societies function. With a clear-eyed vision of the human condition, Mara and Dann is imaginative fiction at its best.",

Here Wills turns to Paul the Apostle, whose writings have provoked controversy throughout Christian history. Upending many common assumptions, Wills argues eloquently that Paul\u2019s teachings are not opposed to Jesus' message. Rather, the best way to know Jesus is to discover Paul. In this stimulating and masterly analysis, Wills illuminates how Paul, writing on the road and in the heat of the moment, and often in the midst of controversy, galvanized a movement and offers us the best reflection of those early times.",

        "Description": "This book can make an extraordinary difference in the way we see one another, ourselves, and the vast amount of suffering in the world. Here is a guide for those who are just beginning to realize that self-fulfillment is possible through service to others. No two people are better qualified to help us along this path than Ram Dass, who has spent more than twenty years teaching and writing on the subject of living consciously, and Mirabai Bush, who succeeded him as chairperson of the Seva Foundation, an international organization devoted to compassionate service.The first part of the book is Ram Dass's spiritual autobiography, in which he reflects on the lessons of his own life and addresses two vital questions: \"What in us responds to the needs of others?\" and \"What can we actually do to alleviate suffering?\" Mirabai Bush then counsels readers on how to identify their most useful talents, gives direction for finding opportunities to serve in the community, and offers very practical suggestions on how to get started.What we have to give is who we are. We need to grow in awareness and insight if we wish to become more effective instruments for change. In this book of heartfelt encouragement and advice, Ram Dass and Mirabai Bush demonstrate the interdependence of social and spiritual development, reawakening in us the memory of true citizenship--a vital force in the conscious relief of pain and suffering. As His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, has said, \"Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.\"",

        "Title": "American Indian Design and Decoration (Dover Pictorial Archive)",
        "Authors": "By Appleton, LeRoy H",
        "Description": "The most original and most powerful design art produced in the Western Hemisphere is also its most indigenous: that of the Indian, in innumerable cultures existing from prehistory to the arrival of the white man, reaching from the Arctic Circle to Tierra del Fuego. It owes, of course, nothing to Europe or the classical Orient. It is tremendous in variety, differing region by region, era by era, often tribe by tribe. It is always vigorously distinctive. This book, 20 years in preparation, shows us that art in all its profuse diversity and in the almost numberless crafts for which the American Indian is famous. Well over 700 examples, drawn with painstaking care, are shown: representations of flora and fauna, men and gods, earth and sky; symbols of clan and tribe, religion and magic; formal designs from the primal to the highly intricate. They appear in examples of basketry, weaving, pottery, sculpture, painting, lapidary work, masks, drumheads, weapons, apparel, beadwork, goldwork, blankets, ponchos, and many other forms. The arts and crafts of Inca, Tiahuanaco, Chim\u00fa, Maya, Axtec, Zapotec, Totonac, Mixtec, Navaho, Zuni, Hopi, Apache, Cherokee, Creek, Winnebago, Dakota, Blackfoot, Nez Perc\u00e9, Cheyenne, Crow, Sioux, Cochiti, Haida, Bellacoola, and others known and unknown are here. Each section is preceded by a page of typical motifs of an area, making it easy to isolate the design elements. In addition, the lore and tradition behind the designs are told in a text reproducing the Indians' own stories and songs. Separate indices simplify locating the work of particular tribes and regions. Craftspeople will find in this book a prolific source of timeless, eternally valid design ideas representing years of research in museums all over the hemisphere; for the graphic artist there is a wealth of material than can be adapted directly to his needs. All those interested in the Americans who preceded us on these continents will find this work unique.",

        "Description": "\"You do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away\" (James 4:14). Living knowing that your life is a vapor is different than just living. Things here are passing away. You\u2019ve got to hold on to what will stand. Savor what matters. This collection of thirty-one articles is full of that heart-longing after Christ that distinguishes Piper\u2019s preaching ministry. Readers will feel as though they have stumbled into a garden as they enter these pages. The Scripture cuts, Christ is exalted in God, and we worship Him.Life Is Short. Eternity Is Long. Live Like It.  You will exist forever. You and God are both in the universe to stay\u2014either as friends on His terms, or enemies on yours\u2014which it will be is proven in this life. And this life is a vapor. Two seconds, and we will be gone.  In these thirty-one meditations, John Piper will connect you to a fresh understanding of God and a renewed relationship with Him. You\u2019ll find your faith stirred to make every day count for Christ when you consider life as a vapor. Story Behind the BookTime is precious. We are fragile. Life is short. Eternity is long. Every minute counts. Oh, to be a faithful steward of the breath God has given me. Three texts resound in my ears: \u201cRedeem the time\u201d (Ephesians 5:16 ); \u201cIt is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy\u201d (1 Corinthians 4:2); \u201cHis grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:10 ).  Surely God means for our minutes on earth to count for something significant. Paul said, \u201cIn the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain\u201d (Philippians 2:16). In the same way, I have good hope from the Lord that my \u201clabor is not in vain in the Lord\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:58 ).",

Since the dealth of her father, Isabelle's family has only functioned on the surface. Her mother, who used to take care of herself, now wears only lumpy, ill-fitting clothes, cries all night, and has taken every picture of her dead husband and put them under her bed. Isabelle tries to make light of this, but the underlying tension is expressed in overeating and then binging. As the novel opens, Isabelle's little sister, April, has told their mother about Isabelle's problem. Isabelle is enrolled in group therapy. Who should show up there, too, but Ashley Barnum, the prettiest, most together girl in class.",

The Book of Psalms is shared by all sections of Judaism and Christianity, and is fundamental to both Christian and Jewish liturgies. Its English translation in the King James Version of the Bible (1611), from which this edition is reprinted complete and unabridged, is an exceptionally beautiful and stirring one, long regarded as a classic of English literature.",

Duke knows high fashion\u2014he has dressed Hollywood A-listers for the red carpet for years\u2014but more important, he understands that putting together a truly fabulous look has everything to do with the woman who\u2019s wearing it. Every woman already knows what she does and doesn\u2019t like, so The Look wastes no time prescribing one-size-fits-all fashion solutions. Instead, it helps women make today\u2019s sometimes-intimidating array of options work cleverly and beautifully for them.It all starts with body type. Once you\u2019ve identified your shape from five broad categories, you\u2019ll learn to choose clothing that maximizes your positive features and downplays less desirable ones. Then, you can shop for flattering outfits that fit your lifestyle, whether you\u2019re a fan of bohemian or preppy, urban chic or country living. The Look also teaches you to mine your own closet (and your friends\u2019, too!) for pieces that can be refreshed or repurposed for a whole new look.Great style is more about a state of mind than it is about a designer wardrobe or a fat bank account. Learning to respect your body and your own taste is a critical part of Duke\u2019s philosophy. Exercises throughout the book help you identify what inspires you as you update your look and feel ever more gorgeous in your own skin. Stunning photographs of real, stylish women, from linear-figured supermodel Cheryl Tiegs to hourglassy fashion writer Merle Ginsberg, will encourage you to mix up and play with fashion to send your own message.With expert tips on everything from making occasion-appropriate accessories choices and matching makeup to your ensemble to spicing up your outfit with personality pieces and stocking up on essentials for work, play, and evenings out, The Look gives you all the tools you need to let your personal style shine through.",

Skinny Legs and All deals, in Robbins\u2019s audacious manner, with today\u2019s most sensitive issues: race, politics, marriage, art, religion, money, and lust. It weaves lyrically through what some call the \u201cend days of our planet. Refusing to avert its gaze from the horrors of the apocalypse, it also refuses to let the alleged end of the world spoil its mood. And its mood is defiantly upbeat.In the gloriously inventive Tom Robbins style, here are characters, phrases, stories, and ideas that dance together on the page, wild and sexy, like Salome herself.

The war in Europe is drawing to a close when the British government finally agrees to send a brigade of five thousand Jewish volunteers from Palestine to Europe to fight the German army. Among these soldiers are Israel Carmi, a veteran of the Haganah underground, a man who serves one army but whose loyalties belong to another; Johanan Peltz raised on, a vast, estate in Poland he dreams of returning home as a British officer and gentleman; and Arie Pinchuk, a former student who has returned to Europe with his own secret agenda -- to rescue his last remaining family member: the little sister he left behind. At the Senio River, Peitz leads the troops in a daring bayonet charge into the heart of the German line. When the savage hand-to-hand combat is finished, the men of the brigade emerge triumphant. At a time when Jews are being victimized, these soldiers -- yellow Stars of David emblazoned on their uniform sleeves -- show the world that a Jewish army can fight back. And win.But when the war ends and the soldiers witness firsthand the horrors their people have suffered in the concentration camps, the men launch a brutal and calculating campaign of vengeance, forming secret squads to identify, locate, and kill Nazi officers in hiding. Their own ferocity threatens to overwhelm them until a fortuitous encounter with an orphaned girl sets the men on a course of action -- rescuing Jewish war orphans and transporting them to Palestine -- that will not only change their lives but also forever alter the course of world history. With The Brigade, bestselling author Howard Blum has written his most harrowing and important book to date -- a story that is certain to make headlines as well as provoke debate about the moral elements ofjustice, the dividing lines between good and evil, and the possibility of redemption.",
