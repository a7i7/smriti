A dancer and choreographer, he would seem to have made the life of his choice: an international reputation; an exquisite French girlfriend, from whom he's been inseparable for seven years; careful plans for an interesting future, with no regrets lingering in his past. Moreover, he is charismatic and physically beautiful.Then, passing through a dark alley, he is accosted by three cloaked and hooded women - fans, he briefly thinks - who drug and then hold him their sexual prisoner. Their motivations remain to him as mysterious as the story of his abduction seems unbelievable, even laughable, to those in whom he later confides his plight and shame. Those eighteen days of bizarre captivity, and the subsequent years of his life, make The Book of Revelation a compelling and disturbing account of the most forbidding aspects of the human psyche.",

In her moving vision, relayed through powerfully told stories, respect is not the passive deference offered a superior but an active force that creates symmetry even in unequal relationships.The reader becomes an eyewitness to the remarkable empowering nature of respect, both given and received&#151;be it between doctor and patient, teacher and student, photographer and subject, and midwife and laboring mother. They will feel it in the reverent attention paid by a minister to the last moments of life, and in the Harvard Law School professor&#39;s lively curiosity about his student&#39;s extracurricular lives.Through the power of her narrative, Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot ultimately makes the reader an intimate partner in her observations of respect linking these varied and intense relationships. A book to be savored and shared, Respect has the power to transform lives.",

But nobody much wants Zen to succeed: not the local authorities, who view him as an interloper, and certainly not Miletti's children, who seem content to let the head of the family languish in the hands of his abductors--if he's still alive. Was Miletti truly the victim of professionals?\u00a0\u00a0Or might his kidnapper be someone closer to home: his preening son Daniele, with his million-lire wardrobe and his profitable drug business?\u00a0\u00a0His daughter, Cinzia, whose vapid beauty conceals a devastating secret? The perverse Silvio, or the eldest son Pietro, the unscrupulous fixer who manipulates the plots of others for his own ends? As Zen tries to unravel this rat's nest of family intrigue and official complicity, Michael Dibdin gives us one of his most accomplished thrillers.",

        "Authors": "By Freund, John E.",
        "Description": "For centuries, humans lived with the \u201cuncertainties\u201d of everyday life, unaware of probability theory and how it might be applied to the solution of simple problems of daily living or used to study the laws of nature. It was not until the advent of the scientific method with its emphasis on observation and experimentation that people began to think about the role probability might play in areas of life that once seemed ruled by blind chance. Today, of course, probability theory is the basis of statistics and game theory, and can be immensely useful to anyone engaged in business, the social and physical sciences, and many other areas of endeavor.This volume demonstrates that the study of probability can be fun, challenging, and relevant \u2014 both to daily life and to modern scientific thought. Lucid, well-written chapters introduce the reader to the concept of possibilities, including combinations and permutations; probabilities, expectations (utility, decision making, more), events, rules of probability, conditional probabilities, probability distributions, the law of large numbers, including Chebyshev\u2019s theorem, and more.Numerous exercises throughout the text are designed to reinforce the methods and ideas explained in the book. Answers to the odd-numbered exercises are provided. A bibliography and summary round out this valuable introduction that will be of great help to anyone engaged in business, social sciences, statistical work, game theory, or just the business of living.",

Drawing upon her influential philosophy of active learning, as well as her personal experience as a parent, Calkins shows parents how to stimulate curiosity and spark creative thinking in children. Having an open and creative approach to conversations, chores, and games can matter just as much as reading, writing, and math. And even in traditional skills like reading and writing, we need to encourage our children to read for meaning and write for expression, rather than focus only on mechanics like phonics and spelling.By giving parents new and imaginative techniques for educating children, and by providing them with an insider&#39;s view of what goes on in the early grades, Raising Lifelong Learners creates the ultimate partnership in learning between home and school, parents and teachers.",

        "Description": "Linear algebra is relatively easy for students during the early stages of the course, when the material is presented in a familiar, concrete setting. But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a brick wall. Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations), are not easily understood, and require time to assimilate. Since they are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, students' understanding of these concepts is vital to their mastery of the subject. David Lay introduces these concepts early in a familiar, concreteRn setting, develops them gradually, and returns to them again and again throughout the text so that when discussed in the abstract, these concepts are more accessible.Note: This is the standalone book, if you want the book/access card order the ISBN below.0321399145 / 9780321399144 Linear Algebra plus MyMathLab Getting Started Kit for Linear Algebra and Its ApplicationsPackage consists of: 0321385179 / 9780321385178 Linear Algebra and Its Applications0321431308 / 9780321431301 MyMathLab/MyStatLab -- Glue-in Access Card0321654064 / 9780321654069 MyMathLab Inside Star Sticker",

        "Authors": "By Kuntzman, Gersh",
        "Description": "Mixed-faith marriages are growing ever more common in the cultural gumbo that is America. This book embraces that stew, shellfish and all. The hybrid holiday Chrismukkah solves the pesky problem of having to celebrate twice. Chrismukkah, though not a new concept, was brought into the pop-culture lexicon by the Fox soap opera The OC and has since exploded in popularity. Gersh Kuntzman tracks down the history, myth, and practice of Chrismukkah. His enthusiasm for Chrismukkah is so great, in fact, that he has constructed a place for the holiday at the core of human society. Gersh\u2019s droll social commentary and liberal use of Biblical history make for a gripping account of the previously untold Chrismukkah story. This book is one part holiday satire, one part celebration, and one part absurd contrivance. From the \u201cRefusal of the Gift\u201d to the \u201cHour of Silent Reflection,\u201d this humorous handbook provides a witty treasury of Chrismukkah lore.",

        "Description": "Death is no joke on Broward's Rock, though reading about deadly doings remains as popular a pastime as ever for citizens of the stormy South Carolina sea island. Now, with spring newly sprung, Annie Darling has conceived of an ingenious promotional scheme to draw customers into her Death on Demand bookshop for the upcoming in-store appearance by world-class mystery author Emma Clyde. Offering a free book to anyone who can solve a series of clues about popular whodunits, Annie and hubby Max pass out their flyers all over town. But an April Fool prankster is distributing a counterfeit flyer, supposedly devised by the Darlings, offering clues to several lethal local \"accidents\" that have occurred lately -- including the drowning of Ms. Clyde's own husband -- complete with not-so-vague accusations of murder.Suddenly the Darling name is mud, thanks to the vicious slanders of an unknown counterfeiter. And Annie knows that she herself is going to have to do the bulk of the sleuthing -- with the only intermittently effective aid of Max--if she doesn't want this particular April Fool's to last well past Memorial Day.Then, just as things couldn't seem to get any worse, they do. In the wink of a bloodshot eye, Annie's hunt for a malicious trickster has become a desperate search for a killer. Because now more than her reputation is at stake. If she can't rid her idyllic isle of a secret slayer, the malefactor's next murderous \"joke\" may be on her!Brimming with stunning surprises, rapier wit, and wonderful suspense -- boasting the author's trademark cast of uniquely unforgettable eccentrics -- Carolyn Hart's lucky thirteenth Death on Demand novel is an unmitigated delight, ranking with the very best of this, or any, contemporary cozy mystery series.

Before long, one of them - the beautiful daughter of a U.S. senator - finds herself the virtual slave of a diabolical Southeast Asian drug lord.High above the English Channel during the early, desperate months of World War II, American pilot Zack Pontowski is almost shot down by a German fighter ace. His first test in the crucible of battle is about to begin.With these two violent events, separated in time by nearly half a century, Richard Herman opens his most ambitious novel to date. As readers of Firebreak already know, Zack Pontowski was to survive his brush with death over France. He would go on to fly many more missions - and ultimately would become Commander in Chief.The kidnapping of Senator Courtland's headstrong daughter is only the latest crisis that confronts President Pontowski. In the New World Order, American military might must be constantly vigilant to the threat of terrorist attack. When the blow falls, it rarely comes at a convenient time, and is likely to strike halfway around the world.And the resolution of the dilemma won't necessarily be easy. Allies must be informed and reassured, fighting forces must be placed in readiness and prepared for insertion. The formidable rivalry between Pontowski and Senator Courtland is a dangerous complicating factor because the scheming senator is quite prepared to further imperil his own child in order to further his political ends.The lights in the Situation Room of the White House will blaze day and night, as the President and his advisers ride the crisis, anticipating each development, squabbling over each conflicting piece of new intelligence, readying their own force for attack.As the dangers escalate, the President will more than once return to thoughts of the time long before, when he was at the cutting edge of a battle, facing his own demons, his own dangerous choices - knowing that the life of one near and dear hung in the balance.Call to Duty is Richard Herman at his best: unrelentingly suspenseful, packed with authentic military action in the air and on the ground, surprisingly insightful about America's role in the New World Order, and the living, breathing humans who must operate by this revised set of rules.",

        "Description": "It's sometimes called a hidden epidemic: One in ten Americans--more than twenty million people--has a thyroid disorder. At any given time, millions of people have an undiagnosed thyroid disorder and experience a chronic mental anguish that almost certainly arises from the very same source. This health crisis flourishes in the shadows of the medical community because many primary-care doctors still don't recognize the importance of the thyroid in mind-body health. In fact, when they do diagnose a thyroid disorder, they treat it as a simple physical problem rather than what it really is: a complex blow to the body and mind--and an increasingly common cause of clinical depression, weight gain, fibromyalgia, high cholesterol, memory loss, anxiety, and other disorders. It's time to treat the source and not the symptom!The Thyroid Solution is the first mind-body approach to identifying and curing thyroid imbalances. Written by a medical pioneer and leading authority in the field of thyroid research, this groundbreaking book offers Dr. Ridha Arem's practical program for maintaining thyroid health through diet, exercise, and stress control--and through his revolutionary medical plan, which combines two types of hormone treatments with astounding results. Inside you'll discover- The thyroid basics--what it is, where it is, what it does- How thyroid hormones affect the brain and alter mood, emotions, and behavior- The difference between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism and why both conditions are often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed- What tests to ask your doctor to give you--and what they mean- The facts your physician may not know about your thyroid, depression, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome- The vital connection between stress and thyroid imbalance- The benefits of antioxidants and essential fatty-acid foods and supplements- How to recognize and cure the deep and lingering effects of a thyroid imbalance- How thyroid hormone can work as an antidepressant when your thyroid gland is normal and conventional antidepressants have failedFilled with remarkable and dramatic patient histories and interviews that document the dramatic results of Dr. Arem's bold new treatments, The Thyroid Solution now gives you and your doctor the tools you need to live a life with peace of mind . . . and body.",

But this notorious corner's 24-hour open-air drug market provides the economic fuel for a dying neighborhood. David Simon, an award-winning author and crime reporter, and Edward Burns, a 20-year veteran of the urban drug war, tell the chilling story of this desolate crossroad.Through the eyes of one broken family--two drug-addicted adults and their smart, vulnerable 15-year-old son, DeAndre McCollough, Simon and Burns examine the sinister realities of inner cities across the country and unflinchingly assess why law enforcement policies, moral crusades, and the welfare system have accomplished so little. This extraordinary book is a crucial look at the price of the drug culture and the poignant scenes of hope, caring, and love that astonishingly rise in the midst of a place America has abandoned.",

He collects mutant candy, he won't venture more than four blocks from his apartment if he can help it, and he definitely doesn't like surprises. On the other hand, his best friend, Lizzy, isn't afraid of anything, even if that might get her into trouble now and then.  Jeremy's summer takes an unexpected turn when a mysterious wooden box arrives in the mail. According to the writing on the box, it holds the meaning of life! Jeremy is supposed to open it on his thirteenth birthday. The problem is, the keys are missing, and the box is made so that only the keys will open it without destroying what's inside. Jeremy and Lizzy set off to find the keys, but when one of their efforts goes very wrong, Jeremy starts to lose hope that he'll ever be able to open the box. But he soon discovers that when you're meeting people named Oswald Oswald and using a private limo to deliver unusual objects to strangers all over the city, there might be other ways of finding out the meaning of life.  Lively characters, surprising twists, and thought-provoking ideas make Wendy Mass's latest novel an unforgettable read.",
