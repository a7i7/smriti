The murder of Dora, the haunted daughter of a respectable bourgeois family, is being investigated by the Inspector, newly schooled in rationalist criminology. Almost every aspect of the case remains hidden, untouchable. He is trying to find the \"error in the situation\"- that small link that will lead him to the truth.His wife, Erszebet, a Hungarian steeped in intuition and the lore of Gypsy mysticism, becomes obsessed with the murder and lauches her own parallel, secret investigation. She is sure that the figs found in Dora's stomach are the clue to the identity of the murderer - for there are no fresh figs in Vienna at this time of the year. With the help of a young British governess, she unmasks an entirely other face of the crime, and of the society that would prefer it to be repressed forever.",

And now, with the Cheney-Bush leading us into permanent war, Vidal asks whose interests are served by this doctrine of pre-emptive war? Was Afghanistan turned to rubble to avenge the 3,000 slaughtered on September 11? Or was \"the unlovely Osama chosen on aesthetic grounds to be the frightening logo for our long contemplated invasion and conquest of Afghanistan?\" After all he was abruptly replaced with Saddam Hussein once the Taliban were overthrown. And while \"evidence\" is now being invented to connect Saddam with 9/11, the current administration are not helped by \"stories in the U.S. press about the vast oil wealth of Iraq which must- for the sake of the free world- be reassigned to U.S. consortiums.\"",

Big trouble.A decade ago, The Bonfire of the Vanities defined an era--and established Tom Wolfe as our prime fictional chronicler of America at its most outrageous and alive. This time the setting is Atlanta, Georgia--a racially mixed late-century boomtown full of fresh wealth, avid speculators, and worldly-wise politicians. The protagonist is Charles Croker, once a college football star, now a late-middle-aged Atlanta real-estate entrepreneur turned conglomerate king, whose expansionist ambitions and outsize ego have at last hit up against reality. Charlie has a 28,000-acre quail-shooting plantation, a young and demanding second wife--and a half-empty office tower with a staggering load of debt. When star running back Fareek Fanon--the pride of one of Atlanta's grimmest slums--is accused of raping an Atlanta blueblood's daughter, the city's delicate racial balance is shattered overnight. Networks of illegal Asian immigrants crisscrossing the continent, daily life behind bars, shady real-estate syndicates, cast-off first wives of the corporate elite, the racially charged politics of college sports--Wolfe shows us the disparate worlds of contemporary America with all the verve, wit, and insight that have made him our most phenomenal, most admired contemporary novelist.A Man in Full is a 1998 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.",

(His portrait of Sinatra is as affectionate and accurate as any written to date.)Schwartz's love for a married woman caught up in the fervor of the sexual revolution of the 1960s, and his other relationships with both lovers and wives, surround his eventually successful career on New York radio.The men and women who have roles to play include Richard Rodgers, Nelson Riddle, Carly Simon, Jimmy Van Heusen, Bennett Cerf, Elizabeth Taylor, and, of course, Sinatra himself.Schwartz writes of the start of FM radio, the inception of the LP, and the constantly changing flavors of popular music, while revealing the darker corners of his own history.Most of all, Jonathan Schwartz embraces the legacy his father left him: a passion for music, honored with both pride and sorrow.",

        "Title": "The Kennedy Curse: Why Tragedy Has Haunted America's First Family for 150 Years",
        "Authors": "By Klein, Edward",
        "Description": "Death was merciful to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, for it spared her a parent's worst nightmare: the loss of a child. But if Jackie had lived to see her son, JFK Jr., perish in a plane crash on his way to his cousin's wedding, she would have been doubly horrified by the familiar pattern in the tragedy. Once again, on a day that should have been full of joy and celebration, America's first family was struck by the Kennedy Curse.In this probing expose, renowned Kennedy biographer Edward Klein-a bestselling author and journalist personally acquainted with many members of the Kennedy family-unravels one of the great mysteries of our time and explains why the Kennedys have been subjected to such a mind-boggling chain of calamities.Drawing upon scores of interviews with people who have never spoken out before, troves of private documents, archives in Ireland and America, and private conversations with Jackie, Klein explores the underlying pattern that governs the Kennedy Curse. The reader is treated to penetrating portraits of the Irish immigrant Patrick Kennedy; Rose Kennedy's father, \"Honey Fitz\"; the dynasty's founding father Joe Kennedy and his ill-fated daughter Kathleen, President Kennedy, accused rapist William Kennedy Smith, and the star-crossed lovers, JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette. Each of the seven profiles demonstrates the basic premise of this book: The Kennedy Curse is the result of the destructive collision between the Kennedy's fantasy of omnipotence-an unremitting desire to get away with things that others cannot-and the cold, hard realities of life.",

Jon Dupre, who runs an upscale call-girl service, is accused of murdering a U.S. senator. Dupre claims to possess proof of the existence of a secret society of powerful men who have banded together for a commonly held political agenda. The rite of passage that binds them together -- the initiation into this powerful brotherhood -- is murder.To Amanda these seem the desperate claims of a man who will lie to save his own skin -- until she is pressured to walk away from the case. Determined to put a knife in the heart of the fear and psychological trauma that has plagued her ever since Cardoni, she refuses to abandon her investigation. It's a decision that will place her and those she loves directly in the path of a deadly juggernaut with ambitions that extend all the way to the presidency of the United States.",

Jesse\u2019s talent is for music, which has given him a livelihood and a home as a bass player in a bar band called Anything Goes. Band life offers the opportunity for the dregs of experience (hangovers, mildewed hotel rooms), and the antics of his band mates (all of them older than he is; some of them wiser, some not) offer more schooling in hard knocks.Anything Goes tells Jesse\u2019s story over the course of a year, during which he finds his life slowly being tempered by the unexpected: by a dad who wants to make up and be part of Jesse\u2019s life; by a female lead singer who suddenly makes the band sound a lot better than they have any right to be; and by the confidence Jesse begins to feel in his own musical talent.A complete departure from the sweeping historical vision of Madison Smartt Bell\u2019s Haitian novels and the gritty cynicism of his intense urban dramas,Anything Goes confirms Bell as one of the most versatile, most gifted, most surprising novelists of his generation.",

        "Authors": "By Maier, Thomas",
        "Description": "Meticulously researched both here and abroad, THE KENNEDYS examines the Kennedy's as exemplars of the Irish Catholic experience. Beginning with Patrick Kennedy's arrival in the Brahmin world of Boston in 1848, Maier delves into the deeper currents of the often spectacular Kennedy story, and the ways in which their immigrant background shaped their values-and in turn twentieth-century America-for over five generations. As the first and only Roman Catholic ever elected to high national office in this country, JFK's pioneering campaign for president rested on a tradition of navigating a cultural divide that began when Joseph Kennedy shed the brogues of the old country in order to get ahead on Wall Street. Whether studied exercise in cultural self-denial or sheer pragmatism, their movements mirror that of countless of other, albeit less storied, American families. But as much as the Kennedys distanced themselves from their religion and ethnic heritage on the public stage, Maier shows how Irish Catholicism informed many of their most well-known political decisions and stances. From their support of civil rights, to Joe Kennedy's tight relationship with Pope Pius XII and FDR, the impact of their personal family history on the national scene is without question-and makes for an immensely compelling narrative. Bringing together extensive new research in both Ireland and the United States, several exclusive interviews, as well as his own perspective as an Irish-American, Maier's original approach to the Kennedy era brilliantly illustrates the defining role of the immigrant experience for the country's foremost political dynasty.",

        "Authors": "By Gurian, Michael",
        "Description": "From depression to dropping grades, from incidents of violence to teen suicide, today's adolescent boys are one of the largest at-risk groups in America today. In this bracing and insightful book, the bestselling author of The Wonder of Boys directs our attention to the unknown problems and marvels of this age group, helping parents and mentors shepherd boys through the challenging ages of ten to twenty.Puberty encourages guilty alienation and fear. The result is that other boys often have a good deal of influence in the lives of younger adolescent friends, for better or for worse. A number of medical conditions have become almost common among adolescent boys, at least in part because of a lack of support. These range from simple depression, to trauma, to the elaborately named attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). Experimentation with drugs and alcohol has become almost common, and these contribute to delinquency and sometimes even to suicide.In A FINE YOUNG MAN Gurian establishes three major stages in a boy\u2019s progress to manhood: transformation (the metabolic changes from ages nine to thirteen), determination (characterized by alternate aggression and withdrawal), and consolidation (indicated by determining and testing definitions of adult male behavior). He concludes by offering what he considers indications that the process of individuation has begun. He returns often to the worthwhile observation that what boys need at every stage of the process of maturing is consistent support from a variety of sources both within and outside of the family. It is this support that is too often lacking.",

THE HUMAN POOL  Rumors about Willi Schmidt's actions during the Second World War were enigmatic, to say the least. He worked for U.S. Intelligence out of Switzerland; he cut black-market deals on the side; he rescued scores of Jews from the Nazis. Saint or sinner? Either way, Schmidt was strictly murky waters -- and reports of his death in 1945 surprised no one. Sixty years later, Joe Hoover is convinced Schmidt is still alive, armed with a false name and a fortune in pharmaceuticals. For years, Hoover, former Intelligence courier for the American spymaster Allen Dulles, has been haunted by misgivings about his own wartime role in his boss's top-secret financial partnership with the Third Reich. Now, someone wants Hoover dead. Back in Europe, Hoover discovers that operations he thought had ended long ago are still being played out. Forming an uneasy alliance with Vaughan, an undercover journalist investigating neo-Nazi traffic of Kurdish refugees, he begins to unravel a conspiracy that leads deep into his past, to his days mixing with Nazi officers in the supposedly neutral cities of Zurich, Istanbul, and Budapest, where enemies did deals over cocktails. At each step, Hoover finds the shadow of Willi Schmidt and the specter of World War II's most grotesque and enduring legacy -- a trade in people: the human pool.  Set against a vivid historical backdrop, The Human Pool mixes fiction and fact to explosive effect. Chris Petit has crafted his finest novel yet -- a cosmopolitan, thinking-person's thriller that turns the world inside out and traces its veins: It spells nothing less than the rebirth of the great espionage novel.",

One year later, Paula Huntley's husband signed on with the American Bar Association to help build a modern legal system in this broken country, and she reluctantly agreed to accompany him. Deeply uncertain as to how she might be of any service in a country that had seen such violence and hatred, Huntley found a position teaching English as a Second Language to a group of Kosovo Albanians in Prishtina.A war story, a teacher's story, but most of all a story of hope, The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo is the journal Hunt-ley kept in scattered notebooks or on her laptop over the eight months that she lived and worked in Kosovo. When Huntley asked her students if they would like to form an American-style \"book club,\" they jumped at the idea. After stumbling upon a stray English-language copy of Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, Huntley proposed it as the club's first selection. The simple fable touched all the students deeply, and the club rapidly became a forum in which they could discuss both the terrors of their past and their dreams for the future.The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo is a compelling tribute to the resilience of the human spirit.",

But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment,  which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail.  Three men  changed Seabiscuit\u2019s fortunes: Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who  introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire.   When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious  mustang breaker from the Colorado plains.  Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for  a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who  was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo  Emerson.  Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad  fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically  indolent also-ran into an American sports icon.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Description": "The Only Oral History of the Ryder CupSince Its Genesis in 1927Us Against Them recounts how the Ryder Cup grew from the brink of extinction to become the most compelling and controversial tournament in golf. The popularity of the Ryder Cup, played every other year in the fall (alternately in the United States and in Europe), has soared in the last ten years. Its worldwide television audience is now the largest of any in golf, and the last tournament, in 2002, was viewed by an estimated 100 million fans.The story of this meteoric rise -- and all the rich history that predated it -- is told in the actual voices of more than forty players and other participants, including Ryder Cup players and captains Curtis Strange, Dave Stockton, Sam Torrance, and Tony Jacklin; American legends Hale Irwin and Billy Casper; U.S. network television commentators Peter Alliss, David Feherty, Peter Oosterhuis, and Jimmy Roberts; Tour players Peter Jacobsen, Tom Lehman, and Brad Faxon; and such names from the past as Dow Finsterwald, Johnny Pott, and Tommy Bolt.More than recalling simply the play-by-play, Us Against Them also goes behind the scenes -- to the Ryder Cup tournament director whose participation almost ended in his own bloody death, to the matches in Britain that nearly ended in blows, to the car crash that some say decided the outcome of one of the matches, to a small plane carrying players that almost fell from the sky, and to the prominent American network golf commentator who introduced himself to a U.S. president while dressed in a large plastic garbage bag!",

        "Authors": "By Colmes, Alan",
        "Description": "As one of the foremost liberal voices in television and talk radio today, Alan Colmes has long been braving the wilds of controversial issues and conservative slander. Already a talk radio star and the only liberal to be heard nationally, Colmes has also taken the television world by storm on Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes, and he is famous for his hard-hitting stance on the challenges that Americans face today.In Red, White & Liberal, Alan Colmes addresses a fundamental question: In this time of uncertainty, how can we protect our freedom without diminishing our liberties, while burnishing our rightful place as the world's beacon of democracy? Colmes urges Americans to see past the tactics of the vocal right and to combat the problems that threaten our liberties, including the government's manipulation of the War on Terror to silence critics and expand its powers to frightening proportions; the lies we've been force-fed about the war in Iraq and the unsettled situation in Afghanistan; the misguided use of religion by the right to justify hatred and prejudice; and the successful conservative smear campaign against the left that has turned liberal into a four-letter word.In order to preserve our freedoms, Colmes calls America back to its liberal roots. He reminds us that our forefathers spoke out against the status quo and fought for the individual's right to opportunity, privacy, and personal choice; that they prized progress and open-mindedness over divisive party politics; and that they believed the ability to express dissent was crucial to keeping a democracy healthy. Colmes suggests that it is our patriotic duty to voice our concern when we feel that wrongs are being done. From debunking the myth of the liberal media to exposing conservative hypocrisy to showing how Jesus was a liberal and the War on Terror is a failure, Colmes presents the issues with thoughtful, provocative arguments, hard facts and logic, and searing humor. He urges us to extend our hands across party lines to find real solutions, protect our shores, and preserve our freedoms.Certain to spark debate and cause readers to both reevaluate and reaffirm their beliefs, Red, White & Liberal is a witty, passionate testament to the liberal ideals that have made America great, and that will continue to ensure liberty and justice for all.",

At the same moment, inside the church, a young man is stealing a treasured artifact, a chalice adorned with a single star-shaped diamond. Both the infant and the chalice disappear.  Seven years later, a few weeks before Christmas, Alvirah and Willy are busy helping Willy's sister Cordelia, a nun who runs a thrift shop that doubles as an after-school shelter for neighborhood kids, prepare for the upcoming Christmas pageant. The future of the shelter is threatened, however, when the city condemns the building for that use, and it is further jeopardized when a nearby brownstone to which the shelter was to be moved turns out to have been willed to a young couple who were tenants in the building. Alvirah refuses to believe that the will is genuine and sets out to prove that the couple are con artists. Soon she is involved in the mystery of the chalice and the child.

The twenty unfinished manuscript pages about a lost young girl - which signaled her most compelling work since Jane Eyre - sat in waiting for almost 150 years until Irish novelist Clare Boylan decided to finish it. This tale allows Bronte's tantalizing fragment of a novel, at last, to blossom.Emma Brown is the story of a young girl, Matilda, brought by her father to a small girls' school in provincial England. The school, Fuchsia Lodge, is foundering, so its new headmistress is delighted to welcome a new pupil - especially one so elaborately dressed with an apparently rich father who is \"quite the gentleman.\" But when the school term ends and it comes time to make arrangements for the Christmas holidays, Matilda's tuition goes unpaid, and the headmistress is shocked to find that the identity of the father, Conway Fitzgibbon - like the address he left behind - is a fiction. Before long, it becomes clear that the little heiress herself is not who she seemed.So who is the mysterious Matilda? When the girl refuses to reveal her true identity and then disappears, it falls to a local gentleman, Mr. Ellin, and Isabel Chalfont, a childless widow who briefly takes the girl in, to unravel the truth. In a journey that takes them from the drawing rooms of English country society to the grimy streets and back alleys of London's seamiest reached, Emma Brown follows the search - first for Matilda's real identity and then for the girl herself.",

        "Description": "Alan White is a hot young writer-producer looking for the one hit every Hollywood writer dreams of - and so few get. He thinks he's found it with his idea for a new pilot. He calls it The Mercenary and the networks have never seen anything like it.The show pours state-of-the-art death and dazzle all over the competing networks. Full frontal nudity. Geysers of blood. Shocking sexuality. The violence is beyond unsettling. It's traumatizing.Soon the ratings are through the roof - the show burns a fifty share on its first airing. America is riveted. The ratings are ready to pop the ozone. Sixty share. Eighty share. It's the biggest Nielsen juggernaut that ever opened its mouth and swallowed America's prime-time attention span. Alan's made it, enjoying success beyond his wildest dreams. But something is going wrong - life is beginning to mimic art with horrifying result.The morning headlines start to read like a grisly rerun of last night's episode of The Mercenary. Then it gets worse. Plots that Alan hasn't yet written or spoken of have begun to blood-blossom into reality.Suddenly the truth becomes chillingly clear. Alan is scripting a nightmare - and it's real. Now he must cancel The Mercenary before it cancels him.Created By explores the darkest recesses of human nature, where the meridian between reality and make-believe is as deceptive as a television screen, and the single difference between the two is that on the other side terror doesn't break for commercials.",

        "Title": "The Tribe of Tiger: Cats and Their Culture",
        "Authors": "By Thomas, Elizabeth Marshall and Williams, Jared Taylor (ILT)",
        "Description": "Elizabeth Marshall Thomas has an instinct for animals and for what makes them behave the way they do. This time her subject is felines - housecats and their wild siblings. \"As the cherub is to the angel, so the cat is to the tiger,\" she writes, \"and although today we tend to put the relationship the other way around, saying that tigers are a kind of cat rather than that cats are a kind of tiger, the fact is that cats and tigers do represent the two extremes of one family, the alpha and omega of their kind.\"The story of this graceful, resourceful tribe begins with what cats are: meat-eaters, first and foremost. But as Thomas shows, within that stark equation abides an astonishing range of experience and expression. Contrary to popular belief, cats - even tigers - are not solitary beings, but are homebodies who \"own\" property much as we do and favor extended clans when food supplies permit. They communicate eloquently with one another and with us - although they interpret our idioms better than we do theirs. Like dogs, they include us in their family structures, but while dogs treat us as friends and equals, cats relate to us hierarchically, as parents or children, and we tend to reciprocate. Most crucially, cats are, like us, individuals who - instinct notwithstanding - pass on, adapt, and invent codes of deportment as circumstances require.Cats, in other words, have culture. Whether they live among us or in the wild, as solo hunters or in circus troupes, they sustain an intricate, elegant, ever-changing web of community with us, among themselves, and with the other creatures, great and small, who dwell in the world.",
