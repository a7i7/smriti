His reputation is deadly, and his manipulation of enormous wealth begins to alter the world's political and financial structure. Although the old KGB has been dismantled, new KGB bosses and old KGB hard-liners bent on reinstating the old guard's lethal techniques are determined to find the sleeper. And so is the world's greatest reporter, Irving Fein.Fein is a character only William Safire could create: driven, mean, funny, always the \"skunk at the garden party.\" Relentlessly resourceful, Fein is always suspicious, always thinking; and his access to the top in politics, the CIA, the media, is the best. But Irving isn't charming, nor is he good on television; and he needs a big story. Viveca Farr is Fein's journalistic opposite - a TV anchorwoman who is popular on the air but lacks stature as a reporter. Working together, they decide to \"walk back the cat\" and break the story of the notorious sleeper spy - even as the sleeper is devising brilliant ways to elude them.",

Yet not even the Witch knows the stunning truth behind the myth and prophecy that fuel her terrible ambition - and she is determined to capture those who will unlock these deepest secrets.In another part of the countryside, a young girl named Orphan is maturing into a beautiful woman in the enchanted village that is her home. And somewhere nearby, a young man named Abasio Cermit is seeking adventure after running away from his family's small farm. Now, as the terrible walkers scour the countryside, Abasio and Orphan begin separate journeys toward each other and the shared destiny that will change their world forever.",

For Perdita cannot marry and attend the Conservatoire, and Alexander remains haunted by guilt and a dark secret from the past. Then an American acquaintance of the two arrives, turning mere gossip into grand scandal.As incessant rain dims the city of light, an intricate network of plots and counterplots swirls around the couple. And a deliciously elegant game of art and life turns deadly serious as a madman stalks first Alexander and then Perdita, threatening to destroy them both in retribution for a murder they know nothing about - or do they?",

        "Description": "\"To tell my own story is to tell that of my famous husband, General John A. Logan,\" explains Mary S. Logan in the preface to her autobiography.  Married to John A. Logan for thirty-one years, Mary Logan shared in her distinguished husband\u2019s career as a prosecutor in southern Illinois, as a Civil War general, and as a senator from Illinois. She observed firsthand the extraordinary events before, during, and after the Civil War, and she knew personally those world leaders who held the power to shape history. After the death of her husband, she maintained her influence in Washington, D.C. \"Under the brightest and darkest skies,\" she explains, \"I have passed than a half-century at the national capital.\"  Born in 1838, Logan writes of her early days growing up in southern Illinois through 1913, when this book was first published. A skillful observer, she recounts events that are personal, regional, and national in scope. In charming detail, she shares her courtship and subsequent marriage to a young prosecutor from Jackson County and the births of their children. She writes proudly of the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858 and her husband\u2019s election to the Thirty-seventh Congress that same year. Logan tells of the coming of the Civil War and of her husband\u2014formerly a Democrat and an enemy of Lincoln\u2014casting his fate with the Union and raising a regiment in southern Illinois. She poignantly describes her brother\u2019s defection to the Confederate Army, her life in war-torn Cairo, Illinois, and her horror at her husband\u2019s severe war wounds. She recounts the battles, the political campaigns, and Lincoln\u2019s reelection and subsequent assassination from her point of view\u2014and, as the wife of a politician and general, hers is a decidedly privileged perspective.  In a position to observe and to participate in events ranging from momentous to minute throughout the latter half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, she reports the essential episodes of history with the flair of journalism, a career she in fact embraced after the death of her husband. She writes movingly of a wounded captain on the road to recovery who suddenly died when the mini\u00e9 shifted next to his lung, amusingly of the excuses soldiers invented to wrangle a pass to town, and elegantly of her trips to Europe and of the pomp and circumstance of the parties attended by the great men and women of the time. Drawing on events grand and small, she re-creates history as only a skillful writer who was in the right place at the right time could.",

Drained of cash and spirit, Wood could not hold out much longer against a devouring giant, the Gannett Company. As editor and publisher of the nationally distinguished weekly Santa Fe Reporter, McCord had successfully fended off Gannett's \"Operation Demolition\" when it moved into town. Now Wood was seeking the help of a survivor.Startling case histories of the dubious tactics practiced by Gannett, unsparing insights into the newspaper industry, and harsh conclusions all come together in the dramatic story of these two men's efforts to save the small Green Bay daily from being obliterated at the hands of the nation's largest newspaper chain. Their success is a metaphor for one of the oldest triumphs of the world: that of David over Goliath.",

Yet all of this is just par for the course in slightly out-of-whack Moose County....Things become downright eerie when Koko begins to pass hours on the porch in the dark, watching the sky for stars - or something. And as the inexplicable goings-on get stranger and stranger, Qwill starts to wonder who or what is in fact responsible, if not extraterrestrial visitors.",

        "Title": "The Fermi Solution: Essays on Science",
        "Authors": "By Von Baeyer, Hans Christian",
        "Description": "From acclaimed science writer Hans Christian von Baeyer, the National Magazine Award - winning author of Taming the Atom, comes a magnificently written book that is a spectacular journey through the workings of the universe and into the minds of the creators of the twentieth-century-world picture, from the legendary geniuses, such as Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and Richard Feynman, to the current generation of scientists who follow in their footsteps.The Fermi Solution is a collection of dramatic tales bristling with subplots, vivid characters, and suspenseful twists and turns. Its subjects range across the spectrum of physical science, from the monumental - the Superconducting Super Collider and the Big Bang - to the enigmatic, such as crystals with impossible structures and the quest for the absolute zero of temperature. The drama of scientific research, the thoughts and feelings of its practitioners, the thrill of discovery, and the indomitable human urge to conquer the unknown form the rich background for the search for meaning that unites scientists and nonscientists alike.With wit and incisive intelligence the author pursues his central question: what do the breakthroughs and revolutionary insights at the cutting edge of science mean for ordinary people? In the course of this pursuit he explores the lessons that Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi's style of research teach us about the art of living, shows how CAT scans illustrate Richard Feynman's definition of the scientific method, and points out the visible clues for Einstein's theory of relativity that can be found in amusement parks. His fresh and illuminating images are drawn from the world of literature as often as from children's playgrounds and from daily life.",

As a teenage beauty queen she spikes her Cokes with spirits of ammonia and baffles her elders with her Freedom Riding sympathies. As a young woman in the 1960s and '70s, she hypnotizes her way to Harvard, finds herself as a lesbian, then very nearly loses herself to booze and shamans. And though the wry, rebellious, and vision-haunted heroine of this exhilarating novel may sometimes seem to be living a magnolia-scented Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman, Blanche McCrary Boyd's The Revolution Of Little Girls is a completely original arid captivating work.",

They tossed a coin to decide whose name should go first on the notice of incorporation, then cast about in search of products to sell.Today, the one-car garage in Palo Alto that housed their first workshop is a California historic landmark: the birthplace of Silicon Valley. And Hewlett-Packard has produced thousands of innovative products for millions of customers throughout the world. Their little company employs 98,400 people and boasts constantly increasing sales that reached $25 billion in 1994.While there are many successful companies, there is only one Hewlett-Packard. Because from the very beginning, Bill and Dave had a way of doing things that was contrary to the prevailing management strategies. In defining the objectives for their company, Packard and Hewlett wanted more than profits, revenue growth, and a constant stream of new, happy customers.",

        "Description": "With Between Two Worlds, David Callahan, author of Dangerous Capabilities: Paul Nitze and the Cold War, has written a provocative analysis of one of the most critical issues facing our nation: what course America's foreign policy should take in the post-Cold War era.The fall of the Soviet Union and an upsurge in global violence have left American foreign policy adrift in recent years. Exhaustively researched and elegantly written, Between Two Worlds unravels a muddled debate to argue that the United States now faces a basic choice between the foreign-policy strategies of realism and idealism. Realists, still dominant in Washington even with the Cold War's end, are preoccupied with safeguarding global order by keeping U.S. forces deployed in Europe and Asia and by preparing to fight new enemies in the Third World. They insist that America must continue the production of weapons begun during the 1980s and maintain defense budgets at near-Cold War levels.Idealists, Callahan among them, bring a more hopeful view to reinventing foreign policy. Callahan mounts a sweeping critique of realism to show how policymakers may be exaggerating the threats confronting the United States. Updating the idealist tradition pioneered by Woodrow Wilson, Between Two Worlds argues that U.S. actions abroad can and should be guided by the values that Americans treasure at home. Callahan's bold strategy for overhauling America's foreign policy would use some funds now spent on defense for new efforts to help fledgling democracies, strengthen international institutions, and promote sustainable development in the Third World.A controversial look at current U.S. foreign policy and a blueprint for more effective American leadership into the twenty-first century, Between Two Worlds is a valuable contribution to one of the most urgent tasks facing us.",

Rosen shares his insights as well as the lessons of thirty-six of the nation's outstanding leaders, among them: Alan Mulally, head of the Boeing 777 project; Barry Alvarez, head football coach at the University of Wisconsin; and Shirley DeLibero of the New Jersey Public Transit Authority. The visionary leaders are changing the landscape of business, and are demonstrating that healthy values, practices, and relationships produce superior results.Leading people is hard work. It is full of tensions and trade-offs, celebrations and disappointments. As Rosen demonstrates through rich stories and insightful analysis, the most successful leaders have a profound understanding of themselves, of the motivations of people around them, and of the external challenges their enterprises face.What America needs to thrive in the next century is not a new management practice or productivity program: what we need is new leadership. Leading People is a call for and a lesson in this new leadership.",

        "Authors": "By Vaughan, Susan C.",
        "Description": "In this fascinating book, Columbia University research scientist and psychoanalyst Susan Vaughan argues that our fundamental view of life as half empty or half full is determined by our capacity for emotional self-modulation. Based on her years of experience as a therapist and researcher, Dr. Vaughan shows how a sense of control over feelings like anger, anxiety, sadness, and even elation promotes optimism and well being. In contrast, feeling out of control makes us pessimistic and glum. Dr. Vaughan asserts that the roots of self-control are laid down through early interactions with caretakers, everyday experiences that literally shape the neural circuitry of the brain. The pictures of self and other formed in the first three years establish the basis for mood modulation in later life. How to limit the impact of early life and reshape our neural circuitry for effective mood modulation is the promise, and the gift, of this book. A convivial and accessible writer, Vaughan engages the reader in a conversation about what really determines whether we see the proverbial glass-as well as ourselves and the world around us-as half empty or half full.",

        "Title": "The Chemistry of Conscious States: How the Brain Changes Its Mind",
        "Authors": "By Hobson, J. Allan",
        "Description": "Do human beings have a soul, a self that is distinct from the mass of nerve cells and electrical impulses that we call the brain? Or is all of consciousness - thoughts, emotions, memories, fantasies, dreams - a set of electrochemical events? Where do we go when we go to sleep, and what is the purpose of dreaming? Are dreams really the disguised fulfillments of secret wishes, as Freud thought, or are they random images summoned by neural activity in the brain, which we do our best to shape into meaningful scenarios as we dream, and edit as stories when we awaken? How does the hallucinatory delirium of our nocturnal experience differ from madness - if at all?Eminent Harvard neuroscientist J. Allan Hobson has written a groundbreaking book about consciousness that overturns our most basic assumptions about identity and human nature and forces us to think again about who we are and what we're made of. In The Chemistry of Conscious States, Hobson argues lucidly and persuasively that the brain and the mind are one - that the thoughts, feelings, dreams, and memories that constitute our consciousness are in fact an amalgam of electrical impulses and chemical interactions. Using anecdote and narrative to illustrate his research on the waking and dreaming brain, Hobson introduces the revolutionary concept of conscious states: the notion that consciousness is not a fixed entity but a dynamic neuropsychological continuum, regulated by the two chemical systems that preside over our waking and dreaming lives.In other words, what we call the self - the \"I\" we refer to so securely - is much more precarious than most of us imagine, for identity, according to Hobson, is not a constant condition at all but a construction whose form reflects the balance, at any given moment, between waking and dreaming. Hobson leads us on a fascinating journey through Harvard's sleep labs and psych wards and, finally, to the pathways of the brain itself. Without questioning the complexity of the human experience, The Chemistry of Conscious States capsizes the rudiments of psychoanalytic theory and offers a stunning new vision to succeed it.From the cutting edge of brain research, here is a gripping theory of human consciousness written with clarity, wit, and magnificent insight, a provocative look at some of the most fascinating science being conducted today.",

It is accelerating our transformation into a more multicultural and multiethnic country, even as it helps redefine our understanding of \"family.\" But negative stereotypes still remain, and new problems-mostly stemming from the corrosive influence of money-are becoming pervasive.Adoption Nation provides valuable insight into the pleasures and perils of adoption, while laying out the ways in which policymakers should revise our laws to improve the process, stop treating members of the \"adoption triad\" as second-class citizens, and remove the obstacles that keep the children who most need permanent homes from getting them. Filled with up-to-the-minute information and a wealth of dramatic real-life stories, Adoption Nation is essential reading for adoptive families, for anyone contemplating adopting a child, and for everyone touched by this extraordinary cultural transformation.",

        "Title": "The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior",
        "Authors": "By Janus, Samuel S., Ph.D. and Janus, Cynthia L.",
        "Description": "Our society, in the opinion of many experts, has gone through more social and sexual change in the past twenty years than in the prior two centuries. Yet, amazingly, until The Janus Report, there has been no scientific study of sexuality since Masters & Johnson's influential report of the 1960s, and no large-scale survey since the Kinsey reports forty years ago.Based on a nationwide survey of adult Americans of every political and religious persuasion, from ages eighteen to eighty and beyond, and from every income bracket and every region of the United States, The Janus Report surpasses all previous studies of American sexuality in both its scope and breadth. Frank, penetrating, and at times surprising in its findings, the Report cuts through platitudes and media hype to delve deeply into the American sexual psyche.Presenting its copious statistical findings in more than 270 tables, along with the observations of a panel of consulting experts, and numerous candid accounts by participants recounting their personal experiences, The Janus Report details for the first time the enormous changes in sexual attitudes and practices that have occurred in the 1980s and 1990s.The Janus Report also sheds new light on a number of today's most important social and political issues including love, marriage, divorce, parenthood, and abortion - offering revelations that are bound to make a lasting impression on the general public and influence the thinking of national policymakers and social scientists for years to come.Some of the Eye-Opening Facts About Contemporary Sex in America Revealed in The Janus Report:...The Death of Sex in America or a Second Sexual Revolution?...Instead of uncovering a new sexual Dark Ages brought on by fear of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, the Drs. Janus found that mainstream Americans have resumed their ongoing love affair with bounteous sex and have begun to successfully cope, creating what the authors term a \"Second Sexual Revolution.\"...Life Begins at 50...People in their 50s, 60s, and 70s - both men and women - are experiencing a greatly heightened level of sexual activity, with people 65 years and older reporting a level only slightly lower than that of people in their 30s-to-40s....Sex and Politics...Ultraliberals are more interested in variety in sex than either independents or Ultraconservatives. Ultraconservatives are three times more accepting of sadomasochistic sex than either Ultraliberals or Independents....Regional Difference...The South has the earliest ages of sexual initiation and the most reported premarital sex. The Midwest consistently reports the least amount of sexual activity....The New Woman...Data identify a distinct new class, career women, whose attitudes on most sexual issues are much more similar to those of men than of women who are full-time homemakers....Sex and Education...Women with the highest education report having the greatest number of sex partners - twice as many as women in any other group. The acceptability of oral sex increases with education....Sex and Money...Eight percent of mainstream middle-income women reported having had sex for money. Middle-income men have the highest incidence of extramarital affairs.",

Wat, a crippled boy, is an outcast in his village and retreats often to the forest, away from the cruel taunts of the villagers.

Wat, outraged, steals the nestlings and escapes into the heart of the forest, where he meets a mysterious old man. He is a mage-a wizard-who teaches him many things, among them how to care for the birds so that they may eventually fly free, and how to find some helpful magic-which is closer to him than he ever believed.",
