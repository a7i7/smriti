It means in a world where every person has turned against him there is one person who will fight by his side for as long as there is a battle to be fought.\u2014Victor CarlAuthor of the acclaimed novels Fatal Flaw, Bitter Truth, and Hostile Witness, bestselling writer William Lashner crafts dark, witty, engrossing tales of suspense involving one of the most intriguing characters of modern popular fiction: Victor Carl.A defense attorney who lives his life in shades of gray, Victor Carl fights all the right fights for all the wrong reasons. With a failing legal practice, a dead-end love life, a pile of unpaid traffic tickets, and a talent for mixing it up in tough working-class bars and sparring with obstinate cops, Victor skates on the razor's edge of legal ethics in search of the easy buck. But the one absolute in Victor's life is loyalty, especially to a client\u2014even if he happens to be dead. Like Joey Cheaps, a no-account who takes a knife to the throat down on the waterfront, but not before he shares with his lawyer his part in a terrible crime.With his client murdered, Victor must search for a killer. But solving the crime means investigating the darkest spot in Joey Cheaps's misspent youth, sending Victor on a twisting journey that leads to a missing suitcase stuffed with money, photographs of a mysterious naked woman, and a Supreme Court justice with a secret to hide. And most dangerous of all, Victor steps into the crosshairs of a vengeful enemy with a past full of pain and a taste for blood.As thrilling as it is darkly evocative, Past Due is a superb tale of crime and justice that takes the intrepid Victor Carl into brilliant new territory and confirms William Lashner's place among the top suspense writers of our time.",

So, though he was the son of the Great Chief of Hikueru, a race of Polynesians who worshipped courage, and he was named Stout Heart, he feared and avoided tha sea, till everyone branded him a coward. When he could no longer bear their taunts and jibes, he determined to conquer that fear or be conquered-- so he went off in his canoe, alone except for his little dog and pet albatross. A storm gave him his first challenge. Then days on a desert island found him resourceful beyond his own expectation. This is the story of how his courage grew and how he finally returned home. This is a legend. It happened many years ago, but even today the people of Hikueru sing this story and tell it over their evening fires.",

Nan Mooney explores how and why some women hurt each other on the job, and what we can do to begin cleaning up the mess. Based on real stories from real women, I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE SHE DID THAT! provides a provocative social and cultural exploration of the often troubled and painful dynamics that unfold among women on the job.\u00a0The massive influx of women into the workplace in the past thirty years means a whole new category of problems has arisen. Suddenly women are working over, under and alongside other women. Their professional relationships are subject to the pressures and conflicts of organizational culture, not to mention society at large. Women on the job have grown more comfortable with ambition, competition and success, but that hasn\u2019t negated the value they place on communication and relationships, on being liked and being nice. Striking a balance between these two selves is a delicate undertaking and many women are uncertain how to interact in a workplace where such lines are regularly being blurred. \u00a0\u00a0Working together, women have fostered a breathtaking degree of positive change. But there is another side to the story. If women are to continue moving forward, the time has come to examine \u2014 honestly and unequivocally \u2014 our very human impulse to compete with, hurt and even destroy one another to get what we want. In I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE SHE DID THAT! Nan Mooney provides vivid insights on the emotional toll competition can take on working women and charts a path towards more productive and fulfilling relationships for professional women everywhere.",
