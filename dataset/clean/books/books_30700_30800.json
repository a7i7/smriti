What is Humanism? Can you define it?If there is in your judgment no clear definition in the literature, you may wish to propose one. You may also wish to focus on the relationship of Humanism to atheism, science, its ethical position, or some other theme.Those who have contributed represent a wide spectrum of Humanist opinion in the world today. They are primarily philosophers, psychologists, social scientists, ethical and religious leaders. Among the themes they discuss are historic roots of Humanism, the general problem of definition, the relationship of Humanism to ethics and morality, Humanism and religion, Humanism and atheism and Humanism on the world scene. Most of the varieties of Humanism are represented, including naturalistic Humanism, liberal Humanism, atheistic Humanism, humanistic psychology, behaviourism, Marxism, and Zen.If there is a common thread running throughout this volume, it is the conviction that Humanism is committed to the method of reason as the chief means of solving problems and the belief that mankind can survive and humans can enjoy a significant life. This conviction and this belief, however, can be realized only if men continue to have confidence in their own natural powers and abilities and the courage to use them.",

It is a complete symbolic system expressing the archetypal structure of the cosmos, of society and of the individual psyche. Traditionally, only those who were mature, trained or wise were permitted to study this hidden, inner aspect of the Torah. Using the basic structure of the Tree of Life, with its fruit, the ten Sefirot or spheres of consciousness, Kabbalah reveals the patterns and correspondences of Creation, and the practices by which the initiate can ascend through the realms to unite with the Absolute, and so serve the divine plan.Although ancient in origin, Kabbalah is alive and continuing to develop. The vast body of knowledge accumulated over the centuries has undergone many changes, adapting to different places and periods, and yet the study of psychology and the path of spirituality have always remained the core of this Hokhmah Nestorah or \"Hidden Wisdom.\" Today in workshops and retreats the timeless wisdom of Kabbalah can be explored anew to provide meaning, growth and spiritual renewal.",

        "Title": "The Little Zen Companion",
        "Authors": "By Schiller, David",
        "Description": "While it seeks neither to define Zen nor answer its most famous koan (a riddle unanswerable by conventional thinking, in this case the sound of one hand clapping), this bestselling little book with 437,000 copies in print possesses a maverick Zen spirit that points to a different way of looking at the world.With each page featuring a quote, phrase, story, koan, haiku, or poem, Zen Companion combines the feeling and format of a meditation book with 2,500 years of wisdom-from Lao-tzu and Groucho Marx, William Carlos Williams and The Little Prince, D. T. Suzuki and Walker Percy, the Buddha and the Bible, Einstein and Gertrude Stein. It's a celebration of intuition: \"If a man wishes to be sure of the road he treads on, he must close his eyes and walk in the dark\"-St. John the Cross. Individuality: \"Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old; seek what they sought.\"-Basho. Uncomplicated nature: \"Among twenty snowy mountains/The only moving thing/Was the eye of the blackbird.\"-Wallace Stevens. Childlike spontaneity: \"Goodnight stars. Goodnight air.\"-Margaret Wise Brown. Irreverent paradox: \"Wakuan complained when he saw a picture of bearded Bodhidharma: 'Why hasn't that fellow a beard?'\" And above all, the simple pleasure of life lived in the moment. \"Chop wood, carry water.\"",

His thousands of extemporaneously composed songs have been widely sung and studied since they were first recorded and disseminated centuries ago by his disciples. This volume features the best and most highly esteemed of the religious leader's songs of love and compassion that include lessons on the negative aspects of ambition and the importance of finding inner peace. In addition, he stresses the briefness of life: \". . . so apply yourself to meditation. Avoid doing evil, and acquire merit, to the best of your ability, even at the cost of life itself. In short: Act so that you have no cause to be ashamed of yourselves and hold fast to this rule.\"",

Susan sets out to determine who is responsible for an attempt on the life of a woman who called in to the show offering information on the mysterious disappearance from a cruise ship, years before, of Regina Clausen, a wealthy investment advisor. Soon Susan finds herself in a race against time, for not only does the killer stalk these lonely women, but he seems intent on eliminating anyone who can possibly further Susan\u2019s investigation.  As her search intensifies, Susan finds herself confronted with the realization that one of the men who have become important figures in her life might actually be the killer. And as she gets closer to uncovering his identity, she realizes almost too late that the hunter has become the hunted. Is she the next one marked for murder?",

Readers from their twenties to their seventies and beyond will experience a new appreciation of themselves through Bobbi's enriching book, and ultimately, even embrace -- yes, embrace -- the aging process.In the engaging, down-to-earth style that's pure Bobbi, she addresses the need-to-know issues we all face at one time or another -- from how to deal with changes in skin to what adjustments in makeup application are really necessary (and appropriate) as we age and everything in between.With more than 300 photographs specially commissioned for this book, Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution includes the personal, heartfelt thoughts of real women from all walks of life -- all ages (from 20 to 101!), shapes, sizes, and ethnicities -- reflecting on what beauty means to them. Their words serve to underscore Bobbi's message that true beauty isn't something you're blessed with -- \"it comes from having confidence and feeling good about who you are.\"",

        "Authors": "By Goodwin, Jason",
        "Description": "Since the Turks first shattered the glory of the French crusaders in 1396, the Ottoman Empire has exerted a long, strong pull on Western minds. For six hundred years, the Empire swelled and declined. Islamic, martial, civilized, and tolerant, in three centuries it advanced from the dusty foothills of Anatolia to rule on the Danube and the Nile; at the Empire's height, Indian rajahs and the kings of France beseeched its aid. For the next three hundred years the Empire seemed ready to collapse, a prodigy of survival and decay. Early in the twentieth century it fell. In this dazzling evocation of its power, Jason Goodwin explores how the Ottomans rose and how, against all odds, they lingered on. In the process he unfolds a sequence of mysteries, triumphs, treasures, and terrors unknown to most American readers.This was a place where pillows spoke and birds were fed in the snow; where time itself unfolded at a different rate and clocks were banned; where sounds were different, and even the hyacinths too strong to sniff. Dramatic and passionate, comic and gruesome, Lords of the Horizons is a history, a travel book, and a vision of a lost world all in one.",

Our earth and its skies are, for the Bush administration, the final frontiers of imperial control. In Hegemony or Survival  , Noam Chomsky investigates how we came to this moment, what kind of peril we find ourselves in, and why our rulers are willing to jeopardize the future of our species.With the striking logic that is his trademark, Chomsky dissects America's quest for global supremacy, tracking the U.S. government's aggressive pursuit of policies intended to achieve \"full spectrum dominance\" at any cost. He lays out vividly how the various strands of policy-the militarization of space, the ballistic-missile defense program, unilateralism, the dismantling of international agreements, and the response to the Iraqi crisis-cohere in a drive for hegemony that ultimately threatens our survival. In our era, he argues, empire is a recipe for an earthly wasteland.Lucid, rigorous, and thoroughly documented, Hegemony or Survival   promises to be Chomsky's most urgent and sweeping work in years, certain to spark widespread debate.",

But this week, it's gone a bit out of control.  A local group of activists calling themselves the Farberville Green Party is protesting a developer's plan to remove a copse of trees by having retired schoolteacher Miss Emily Parchester camp out in one of them while chained to it by the ankle. While concerned about the aged Miss Parchester's vigil in the tree, Claire isn't able to talk her down-and if that wasn't turmoil enough, a baby is left on Claire's doorstep with a note from his mother asking her to care for him for a few days.         While trying to track down the mother, Claire tries to avoid alerting either the authorities or the local gossips, but both efforts are doomed to failure.  When Claire is sighted buying diapers, the unlikely rumor that her daughter has an illegitimate child runs rampant in Caron's high school.  And when Claire does track down the mother of the child, it is because the teenager has been arrested for the murder of her own father - who is the local developer at the center of the controversy surrounding the trees.      Unconvinced that the baby's mother is really responsible, and juggling feedings and diaperings for the first time in fifteen-some years, Claire decides that the only way to rescue Caron's reputation and the baby's mother - not to mention coaxing Miss Parchester down out of the tree - is to uncover the truth behind the murder.",

In 1861 the Civil War reached the mountainous South-where the enemy was your neighbor, the victims were your friends, and the wrong army was whichever one you joined. When Malinda Blalock's husband, Keith, joined the army, she dressed as a boy and went with him. They spent the war close to home in the North Carolina mountains, acting as Union guerrilla fighters, raiding the farms of the Confederate sympathizers and making as much trouble as they could locally. As hard-riding, deadly outlaws, Keith and Malinda avenged Confederate raids on their kin and neighbors. McCrumb also brings into her story the larger-than-life narrative of the historical political figure Zebulon Vance, a self-made man and Confederate governor, who was from the mountains and fought for the interests of Appalachia within the hierarchy of the Confederacy.  Linking the forces of historical unrest with the present-day stories of mountain wisefolk Rattler and Nora Bonesteel, McCrumb weaves two overlapping narratives. It is up to Nora Bonesteel and Rattler to calm the Civil War ghosts who are still wandering the mountains, and prevent a clash between the living and the dead.",

He was also surprised to see how easy his nomination and confirmation turned out to be once Harry had given his approval and pulled more than a few strings.Now Tim feels he has the chance to make a difference, and perhaps clear a path for an eventual trip to the highest court in the land. But Tim soon realizes that Chief Judge Winston's influence and favors come at a price-not just undue influence from the Executive branch, but partiality towards private concerns as well, including a certain attorney whose cases often come before their bench..Winston expects his favors to be repaid in kind, by following his judicial lead and assuring a consistent majority ruling in matters as he sees fit... and he is not afraid to bring pressure to bear, financial or otherwise.Troubled Tim contacts a former paramour, now a Federal prosecutor, to help him unravel the unseemly entanglements that occur behind the bench. But in doing so, risks his own status as a judge, his good name, and perhaps even the lives of him and his family-it is sometimes deadly to disagree when The Majority Rules.",

The AT offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes\u2014and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings.For a start there's the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz, a buddy from Iowa along for the walk. Despite Katz's overwhelming desire to find cozy restaurants, he and Bryson eventually settle into their stride, and while on the trail they meet a bizarre assortment of hilarious characters. But A Walk in the Woods is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson's acute eye is a wise witness to this beautiful but fragile trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America's last great wilderness. An adventure, a comedy, and a celebration, A Walk in the Woods has become\u00a0a modern classic of travel literature.",
