And when a naive girl with a gift for keen observation enters the court, she can hardly imagine the role she will play in bringing England\u2014indeed, the whole of Europe\u2014to the brink of war. Nor can she foresee her own journey to the brink of ecstasy and beyond. . . . When she becomes a junior lady of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s bedchamber, Rosamund is instructed by her cousin, the brilliant and devious secretary of state Sir Francis Walsingham, to record everything she observes. Her promised reward: a chance at a good marriage. But through her brother Thomas, Rosamund finds herself drawn to the forbidden, rough-and-tumble world of theatre, and to Thomas\u2019s friend, the dramatic, impetuous playwright Christopher Marlowe. And then Rosamund meets Will Creighton\u2014a persuasive courtier, poet, and would-be playwright who is the embodiment of an unsuitable match. \u00a0The unsanctioned relationship between Rosamund and Will draws the wrath of Elizabeth, who prides herself on being the Virgin Queen. Rosamund is sent in disgrace to a remote castle that holds Elizabeth\u2019s cousin Mary Stuart, the imprisoned Queen of Scots. Here, Walsingham expects Rosamund to uncover proof of a plot against Elizabeth. But surely, nothing good can come of putting an artless girl in such close proximity to so many seductive players and deceptive games. Unless, of course, Rosamund can discover an affinity for passion and intrigue herself. . . . New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Jane Feather conspires with history to tell this dazzling story about two very real, very wily queens\u2014 and one impassioned young woman whose life they change forever.",

Lucky was on her way to becoming a pop star when she died, and Wonder and her family are still trying to recover from their loss. Offered a recording contract, Wonder jumps at the chance to escape from a dead-end town, her fractured family, and worst of all, high school.

And maybe what Wonder really wants is as simple as a guy who likes her for herself. With spark and humor Rachel Cohn captures the struggles and glories of an ordinary teenage girl's climb to celebrity.

Off to an early morning meeting in Scotland Yard, Superintendent Mike Yeadings boards a commuter train and prepares for the trip. The train, however, doesn't get too far before coming to a screeching halt: there is a body on the tracks. What at first looks like a suicide is soon revealed to be a vicious crime-the victim has been garroted and his hands mutilated. His pockets are also empty which makes them wonder if robbery was the motive or if the killer was trying to hide the identity of the victim to protect himself. Yeadings soon discovers that the victim was a customs officer and that he had been investigating a possible counterfeit operation at Fraylings Court-a family estate that has recently started hosting theme holidays and offering many classes in order to pay off their mounting debt. Along with the guests requiring art lessons, dance classes, and a dog-training course, some shady characters have emerged and started their own nightly poker school. Among those regularly dealt a hand is Detective Sergeant Rosemary Zyczynski of the Thames Valley Police who is working undercover to solve the murder. Will she be able to reveal the killer and the counterfeit operation while maintaining a poker face?",

I look forward to many more Mac Faraday mysteries.\"\u00a0 John J. Lamb, author of the Bear Collector Mysteries \"A most unusual and surprising plot, intriguing characters, snappy dialogue, great settings and a dog named Gnarly are the prime ingredients in Lauren Carr's terrific new mystery, It's Murder, My Son.\" F.M. Meredith, author of An Axe to Grind What started out as the worst day of Mac Faraday's life would end up being a new beginning. After a messy divorce hearing, the last person that Mac wanted to see was another lawyer. Yet, this lawyer wore the expression of a child bursting to tell his secret. This covert would reveal Mac as heir to undreamed of fortunes, and lead him to the birthplace of America's Queen of Mystery and an investigation that will unfold like one of her famous mystery novels. Soon after she moves to her new lakefront home in Spencer, Maryland, multi-millionaire Katrina Singleton learns that life in an exclusive community is not all good. For some unknown reason, a strange man calling himself \"Pay Back\" begins stalking her. When Katrina is found strangled all evidence points to her terrorist, who is nowhere to be found. Three months later the file on her murder is still open with only vague speculations from the local police department when Mac Faraday, sole heir to his unknown birth mother's home and fortune, moves into the estate next door. Little does he know as he drives up to Spencer Manor that he is driving into a closed gate community that is hiding more suspicious deaths than his DC workload as a homicide detective. With the help of his late mother's journal, this retired cop puts all his detective skills to work to pick up where the local investigators have left off to follow the clues to Katrina's killer.",

After \"THE END\" revises our concept of revision, illustrating it as a constant inventive search for new possibilities and divergent meanings, rather than mere correction or what students wearily refer to as \"redoing.\" For students in upper elementary to secondary school and beyond, and for every teacher looking to develop a common language of craft in the classroom, After \"THE END\" is a book of practical ideas and applications that inspire the reader to put it down and put it to use.",

Lopez chronicles every aspect of fighter combat in that theater: harrowing aerial battles, interludes of boredom and inactivity, instances of courage and cowardice. Describing different pilots\u2019 roles in each type of mission, the operation of the P-40, and the use of various weapons, he tells how he and his fellow pilots faced not only constant danger but also the munitions shortages, poor food, and rat-infested barracks of a remote sector of the war. The author also offers keen observations of wartime China, from the brutalities of the Japanese occupation to the conflict between Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and the Communist movement.This edition of Lopez's acclaimed account features new photographs, most of which have never before been published. Relating how the 23rd Fighter Group continued to win battles even as the Japanese gained ground, Into the Teeth of the Tiger is the humorous and insightful memoir of an ace pilot caught in the paradox of victory in retreat.",

The answers appear on another page, where you see the objects the way you usually look at them. Have you ever really looked at a single red-and-white spiral on a candy cane? Could you recognize a notch on the gear of a can opener? Or, a pair of kernels of corn? Of course you've seen them all before. They're so familiar, they're almost impossible to recognize!

Chiropractic doctors Todd and Sheldon Sinett have developed a new approach to diagnosing and relieving back pain based on the idea that the causes of back pain come from three distinct influences: structural-actual physical damage; nutritional-an unhealthy diet; and emotional-stress and personal issues that affect health.  Instead of resorting to radical therapies or surgical treatments, the Sinetts dispel the many prevalent myths about back pain and propose solutions that use non-invasive physical and easy-to-implement mental techniques. Offering concrete and specific advice ranging from exercises and meal plans to methods for dealing with everyday stress, this book provides all the necessary tools to understand the root causes of back pain and take the appropriate measures for relief.  For both sufferers and medical practitioners, The Truth About Back Pain will revolutionize way back pain is treated.",

        "Description": "It&#39;s pure bottled magic! A complete kit that ingeniously marries science and fun in the breakthrough vein of The Bug Book & Bug Bottle\u00a0and The Bones Book & Skeleton, Pop Bottle Science presents 79 easy, hands-on experiments that probe the worlds of chemistry, physics, biology, geology, weather, the human body, and even astronomy. The Pop Bottle bottle is a perfect miniature science lab--see-through, flexible, air-tight when necessary, made out of a durable, shatter-proof plastic and designed with a removable top that doubles as a funnel. The Pop Bottle book is a lively, fully illustrated 96-page guide to astonishment. Each experiment begins with a challenge and ends with an explanation of the scientific principles involved. Kids can design a volcano and watch it erupt. Create a tornado-maker and see how twisters work. Make quicksand--is it solid or liquid? Observe photosynthesis in action. Simulate Jupiter&#39;s giant red spot, investigate buoyancy, demonstrate inertia, and discover the Bernoulli principle--which allows planes to fly. Plus, turn the bottle into a barometer, a thermometer, walkie-talkie, trombone, compass--or groovy lava lamp.",

        "Authors": "By Griffin, Charles C., Kosack, Stephen, and Tolmie, Courtney",
        "Description": "A Brookings Institution Press and Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation publicationThis book is based on a simple concept: no one is in a better position to hold a government accountable than those it governs.When governments fail to meet the needs of their citizens, the internationalcommunity often turns to large external organizations such as the InternationalMonetary Fund or the World Bank. These analysts and monitors may have theresources and expertise to analyze and advise on public spending and governance,but where do they go when the time comes to implement new policies? And can theyreally have a more nuanced understanding of the country's problems than its owncitizens? Who is there to watch day and night to hold the government accountable?From the Ground Up proposes that the international community's efforts to improve public expenditure and budget execution decisions would be more effective if done in collaboration with local independent monitoring organizations. Stephen Kosack, Courtney Tolmie, and Charles Griffin track the work of sixteen independent monitoring organizations from across the developing world, demonstrating how these relatively small groups of local researchers produce both thoughtful analysis and workable solutions. They achieve these results because their vantage point allows them to more effectively discern problems with governance and to communicate with their fellow citizens about the ideals and methods of good governance.The authors also outline some disadvantages facing independent monitoringorganizations, such as insufficient resources, inadequate access to data, and too little influence with high government officials. Collaboration with larger international organizations could help independent monitoring organizations overcome such obstacles, increasing their chances of improving governance&#151;from the ground up.",

        "Description": "It is 1991 and the United States Government has been pressing Colombia to extradite drug dealers to the U.S. In response, the drug-cartel overlords join forces with international terrorists to form Puno Blanco, a narco-terrorist group, and initiate a daring and deadly plan: shift the battleground to New York City and export terrorism to the United States. The target: the New York City Police Department.Only four people have a chance of stopping Puno Blanco before New York City self-destructs: Dan Morgan, a highly respected police inspector whose effectiveness may be crippled by a guilty conscience; Chris Liberti, an ambitious FBI agent who has to prove her worthiness in a virtually all-male world; Donal Castillo, a DEA agent with a knack for hand-to-hand combat whose hatred of drug dealers threatens to compromise his professionalism; and Ray Fleming, a young and frighteningly inexperienced undercover officer who becomes the crucial linchpin between the two warring groups.Challenged by their common goals and the vision of New York City in ultimate chaos, the FBI, NYPD, and DEA unite in this tense and hard-hitting fiction. From sweaty bars to ritzy gun clubs to the Commissioner's office, Michael Grant brings to vivid life New York's battle-scarred streets, and the efforts of New York's finest to keep them under control. Filled with unforgettable characters and classic police drama, Officer Down is a standout in the genre, the most gripping and authentic crime writing since vintage Wambaugh.",
