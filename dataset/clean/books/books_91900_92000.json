        "Title": "Jamestown: The Buried Truth",
        "Authors": "By Kelso, William M.",
        "Description": "What was life  really like for the band of adventurers who first set foot on the banks of the James River in 1607? Important as the accomplishments of these men and women were, the written records pertaining to them are scarce, ambiguous, and often conflicting, and those curious about the birthplace of the United States are left to turn to dramatic and often highly fictionalized reports. In  Jamestown, the Buried Truth, William Kelso takes us literally to the soil where the Jamestown colony began, unearthing the James Fort and its contents to reveal fascinating evidence of the lives and deaths of the first settlers, of their endeavors and struggles, and of their relationships with the Virginia Indians. He offers up a lively but fact-based account, framed around a narrative of the archaeological team's exciting discoveries. Once thought to have been washed away by the James River, James Fort still retains much of its structure, including palisade walls, bulwarks, interior buildings, a well, a warehouse, and several pits, and more than 500,000 objects have been cataloged, half dating to the time of Queen Elizabeth and King James. Artifacts especially reflective of life at James Fort include an ivory compass, Cabasset helmets and breastplates, glass and copper beads and ornaments, ceramics, tools, religious icons, a pewter flagon, and personal items. Dr. Kelso and his team of archaeologists have discovered the lost burial of one of Jamestown's early leaders, presumed to be Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, and the remains of several other early settlers, including a young man who died of a musket ball wound. In addition, they've uncovered and analyzed the remains of the foundations of Jamestown's massive capitol building. Refuting the now decades-old stereotype that attributed the high mortality rate of the Jamestown settlers to their laziness and ineptitude,  Jamestown, the Buried Truth produces a vivid picture of the settlement that is far more complex, incorporating the most recent archaeology to give Jamestown its rightful place in history and thus contributing to a broader understanding of the transatlantic world.",

Chapter 2 offers guidance in transforming an idea into a logical design that's safe, practical, and affordable. Succeeding chapters instruct on collecting and organizing data, writing a report or giving an oral presentation, building a display, and improving a project as it evolves. She also provides helpful checklists on topics ranging from safety to seeking expert help. Kids learn to enjoy doing original science projects, rather than merely repeating experiments taken from books. Middle school and high school students who think they hate science will change their minds in a hurry when they use this book.",

        "Title": "A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]",
        "Authors": "By Dick, Philip K.",
        "Description": "A haunting graphic version of one of Philip K. Dick\u2019s most popular and best-selling novels. Bob Arctor is a dealer of the lethally addictive drug Substance D, which he also takes in massive quantities. Fred is the police agent assigned to tail and eventually bust him. What Fred doesn\u2019t know is that Substance D gradually splits the user\u2019s brain into two distinct, combative entities, and that he is, in fact, in frantic pursuit of himself. A Scanner Darkly is caustically funny and razor sharp in its depiction of drug-induced paranoia and madness; it\u2019s an industrial-strength stress test of identity as unnerving as it is riveting. The novel is captured in this brilliant graphic vision, composed entirely of stills from the movie. Writer/Director Richard Linklater shot a live-action film, starring Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, and Winona Ryder, and then animated over the underlying images. The result is an eerily lifelike, richly detailed animation that translates beautifully to the page.",

Practically a century of history and of an artistic evolution that, arisen from the agelong, consummate technical, material and creative legacy of the European art craftsmanship of the preceding centuries, also took into account industrial production and the radical changes of society and taste that occurred in Europe and the United States between the second half of the nineteenth century and the 1950'sThe Dictionary, enhanced by over three hundred illustrations, provides information, critical commentaries, historical data about artists, designers, manufactories, laboratories, techniques and materials connected with glass and crystal, silverware and jewellery, processed metals, textiles and furnishings, pottery and porcelain, furniture, offering an appendix featuring a concise bibliography raisonn\u00e9 and a repertory of trademarks, related to pottery production, of of signatures and trademarks of artists working in the various fields. Perusual of the individual headings and the illustrations allows to review the history and the evolution of the decorative arts in Europe and the Unites States from Biedermeier to the eclectic and historicist taste, from international modernism, with its different Secessions and liberty versions, to art deco, from Novecento style up to industrial design.",

Now in Change Forces - The Sequel he extends and expands the use of chaos theory as a lens through which to view and comprehend change, and the forces which govern it. Educators have already widely embraced this approach, and taken on board the idea that change is not so straightforward as we might hope. As Fullan worked on his ideas relating them to school systems, higher education and research, the field of change forces was also developing significantly. This volume covers new aspects of this 'science of complexity' and helps educators obtain insights for delving deeper into moral purpose, and expanding into fresh dimensions of changing forces in the environment.The first volume appealed to a wide market from classroom teachers, through school administrators, to student teachers and academics. This volume will appeal to a similar cross-section.",

He emerges with a penetrating analysis of the competing forces that nurture the Ivy League goals of the academic elite while often quashing the less glamorous dreams and potential of the rest. His investigation shows that America's best high schools often cultivate complacency when challenges and incentives should be available to all.",

        "Title": "Dawn Over Baghdad: How the U.S. Military Is Using Bullets and Ballots to Remake Iraq",
        "Authors": "By Zinsmeister, Karl",
        "Description": "THIS IS A COMPLETELY FRESH, close-up look at the guerilla struggle in Iraq. It is built on weeks spent re-embedded with U.S. soldiers in the most dangerous parts of the Sunni Triangle in early 2004, direct polling of Iraqis, and unmatched reporting on combat raids, interrogations, daily diplomacy, and reconstruction heroics.     It follows the author's \"Boots on the Ground: A Month with the 82nd Airborne in the Battle for Iraq,\" which was the first book from an embedded reporter describing the toppling of Saddam Hussein. Gripping, perceptive, funny, and bluntly honest, \"Boots\" became the most popular chronicle of the hot war in Iraq. Now Karl Zinsmeister has again beaten the pack with this groundbreaking sequel on the counterinsurgency phase of the war. This is a powerful, clich\u00e9-smashing, up-to-the-minute report on America's most urgent national struggle, as seen through the eyes of ordinary Iraqis and the U.S. servicemen doing today's dirty work.     \"Dawn Over Baghdad\" takes you into Iraq's urban neighborhoods, rural villages, and guerilla snake pits, and shows exactly how young American soldiers are quietly but inexorably choking off a terrorist insurrection and planting the seeds (sometimes at great personal cost) of a dramatically different Middle East. Zinsmeister brings home a fascinating, intimate, and insightful story missed by the major media: With the quiet cooperation of millions of everyday Iraqis, the U.S. is approaching something historic -- success in a tough guerilla war.      Includes a 32-page section of color photos taken by the author.",
