Edelman takes issue with the many current cognitive and behavioral approaches to the brain that leave biology out of the picture, and argues that the workings of the brain more closely resemble the living ecology of a jungle than they do the activities of a computer. Some startling conclusions emerge from these ideas: individuality is necessarily at the very center of what it means to have a mind, no creature is born value-free, and no physical theory of the universe can claim to be a \u201dtheory of everything\u201d without including an account of how the brain gives rise to the mind. There is no greater scientific challenge than understanding the brain. Bright Air, Brilliant Fire is a book that provides a window on that understanding.",

Yet Chloe is disturbed\u2014by the aggression of her government\u2019s foreign policy, by the poacher who roams the land behind her studio punctuating her solitude with rifle fire, and finally, by Toby\u2019s new girlfriend, a Croatian refugee named Salome Drago.Raised in the Croatian expatriate community of New Orleans, Salome is a toxic mix of the old world and the new: intelligent, superstitious, sly, seductive, and confident. But Salome\u2019s past is a mine of dangerous secrets, and the violence that destroyed her homeland is far from over. Chloe distrusts her on sight, and as Toby\u2019s obsession with Salome grows, Chloe\u2019s mistrust deepens, alienating her from her tolerant husband and besotted son. Rich with menace, the novel unfolds in a world where darkness intrudes into bright and pleasant places, a world with betrayal at its heart.

        "Title": "Crime and Punishment in American History",
        "Authors": "By Friedman, Lawrence Meir",
        "Description": "In a panoramic history of our criminal justice system from colonial times to today, one of our foremost legal thinkers shows how America fashioned a system of crime and punishment in its own image.Lawrence M. Friedman argues that the evolution of criminal justice has reflected transformations in America's character. Thus the theocratic world of seventeenth-century Puritanism generated a peculiar equation between crime and sin. The extraordinary geographic and social mobility of nineteenth-century America produced its own distinctive approach to crime and punishment. And the expressive individualism of the twentieth century encouraged an emphasis on \"crimes of the self.\"Crime and Punishment in American History covers vast and fascinating terrain: the Salem witchcraft trials; the Red Scare after World War I; the rise of the American penitentiary; the emergence of the professional detective; the development of laws against fornication and gambling and the reform of rape laws; the rise of the insanity defense; the growth of a prisoners rights movement; and much more. It is about vigilantes, outlaws, embezzlers, swindlers, and what happened to them; about the growth of white-collar crime; and about revolutionary changes in the relationship between gender and criminal justice.Informed by the perspective of the social sciences, this book is a social history of crime and punishment, the story of the social reaction to crime. Not a history of criminal law or an intellectual history of penology or a treatise on the philosophy of good and evil, this book chronicles the development of a working system of criminal justice, from arrest to trial to prison and punishment.Serious crime has skyrocketed in our day, affecting the lives of millions of people directly and all of us indirectly. This elegant and magisterial history helps us understand why this is happening - where we have been and where we are heading. It is a story that needs to be told.",

In The Meaning of Jesus two leading Jesus scholars with widely divergent views go right to the heart of these questions and others, presenting the opposing visions of Jesus that shape our faith today.  In alternating chapters, Marcus Borg, the most popular revisionist voice on Jesus and a member of the Jesus Seminar, and N. T. Wright, the most prominent standard\u2013bearer for the traditional stance and an outspoken critic of the Jesus Seminar, present their views of who Jesus was, what he taught, and what he did.  Candid, spirited, and thoughtfully debated, this compelling discourse will stimulate fresh ideas and intense dialogue among anyone concerned with what it means to be a Christian today.",

Meanwhile, scenting a sure kill in the \"War on Terror,\" the rival spies of Germany, England and America converge upon the innocents.Thrilling, compassionate, peopled with characters the reader never wants to let go, A Most Wanted Man is a work of deep humanity and uncommon relevance to our times.",

Written with the pure joy of discovery, Ancient Inventions is a treasure trove of the triumphs and marvels of applied science, from the stone tools hewn by the earliest prehistoric people to the dawn of the modern era in 1492.Historian and archaeologist team Peter James and Nick Thorpe have pooled their expertise in amassing this compendium of human ingenuity through the ages. Together they conclusively prove that our ancestors, however long ago they lived and whatever part of the globe they occupied, were brilliant problem-solvers.Organized thematically, Ancient Inventions covers everything from medicine to communication, from high-tech devices to city life, from military equipment to sports and leisure, from transportation to human sexuality. Brimming with odd facts and entertaining curiosities, written with zest and humor, comprehensive and fun to read, Ancient Inventions is a wonderful celebration of the endless inventiveness of the human mind.",

The night before the festival begins, a group of employees at the local market learn that they have won $160 million in the lottery. One of their co-workers, Duncan, decided at the last minute, on the advice of a pair of crooks masquerading as financial advisers, not to play. Then he goes missing.

        "Description": "A photo essay on the life and times of America's 40th President. \"He did not adjust his beliefs to conform to prevailing political winds.... Instead he spoke directly from his heart to the hearts and minds of the American people. And, in doing so, he initiated the greatest love affair between an American President and his constituents in recent history.\" -- Frederick J. Ryan, Jr., chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation Even before he made the White House his home, Ronald Reagan spoke for the American people, capturing the hearts of small-town citizens and world leaders alike. His remarkable career in public life, spanning over fifty years, began in the Midwest, as a student leader and sports broadcaster, then in Hollywood as an actor and long-time director of the Screen Actors Guild, later as governor of California, and finally, as president of the United States. His legacy, too, is extraordinary: In the eight short years as president, Ronald Reagan presided over epochal international changes and ushered in unparalleled peace and prosperity--not only to his country but the world. Ronald Reagan: An American Hero is the story of Ronald Reagan's trials and triumphs, the story of his character and vision and values. It's the love story of a man for his wife, his country, and the world--the story of his unquenchable passion for liberty and life itself. Over 500 archival and full-color images, including many never-before-published photographs from Nancy Reagan's private collection and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, chronicle the milestones of America's fortieth president. Punctuating this visual history are close to 200 quotes from world leaders, actors, journalists, family, and friends who bear testimony to the greatness of the man who, for millions, has become an enduring American hero.",

It is a story of tremendous courage, astonishing achievement and heart-breaking loss. Their leader was the boyish, fanatically driven Chris Bonington. His inner circle \u2014 which came to be know as Bonington\u2019s Boys \u2014 included a dozen who became climbing\u2019s greatest generation. Bonington\u2019s Boys gave birth to a new brand of climbing. They took increasingly terrible risks on now-legendary expeditions to the world\u2019s most fearsome peaks. And they paid an enormous price for their achievements. Most of Bonington\u2019s Boys died in the mountains, leaving behind the hardest question of all: Was it worth it?The Boys of Everest, based on interviews with surviving climbers and other individuals, as well as five decades of journals, expedition accounts, and letters, provides the closest thing to an answer that we\u2019ll ever have. It offers riveting descriptions of what Bonington's Boys found in the mountains, as well as an understanding of what they lost there.",

        "Description": "The fifth volume in Carroll and Graf\u2019s successful series of literary references, which has included Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s The Great Gatsby, Hardboiled Mystery Writers, and The Beats, provides an engagingly documented account of Raymond Chandler\u2019s life and work. Born in Chicago in 1888 but raised in Victorian England, Chandler was publishing poetry in London literary magazines when he set out at twenty-four for California and a business career. Two decades later he held the directorship of a lucrative oil conglomerate, until heavy drinking ended all that. Forced to return to professional writing for his livelihood, with artistic aspirations Chandler began writing detective stories in the hard-boiled style of Dashiell Hammett for popular pulp magazines. Then, in 1939, he published The Big Sleep, and the world met the slick, wisecracking sleuth Philip Marlowe in a decadent, glamorous Los Angeles rife with gangsters, crooked politicians, and dissolute movie queens. Amply illustrated with personal photographs and with reproductions of manuscript pages, letters, print ads, movie promotions, dust jackets, and paperback covers, this volume follows Chandler\u2019s career from his early pulp fiction to his classic detective novels.",

        "Title": "The Pontiff in Winter: Triumph and Conflict in the Reign of John Paul II",
        "Authors": "By Cornwell, John",
        "Description": "Over more than a quarter of a century, John Paul II has firmly set his stamp on the billion-member strong Catholic Church for future generations and he has become one of the most influential political figures in the world. His key role in the downfall of communism in Europe, as well as his apologies for the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of Jews and to victims of the Inquisition, racism, and religious wars, won him worldwide admiration. Yet his papacy has also been marked by what many perceive as misogyny, homophobia, and ecclesiastical tyranny. Some critics suggest that his perpetuation of the Church\u2019s traditional hierarchical paternalism contributed to pedophiliac behavior in the priesthood and encouraged superiors to sweep the crimes under the carpet. The Pontiff in Winter brings John Paul\u2019s complex, contradictory character into sharp focus. In a bold, highly original work, John Cornwell argues that John Paul\u2019s mystical view of history and conviction that his mission has been divinely established are central to understanding his pontificate. Focusing on the period from the eve of the millennium to the present, Cornwell shows how John Paul\u2019s increasing sense of providential rightness profoundly influenced his reactions to turbulence in the secular world and within the Church, including the 9/11 attacks, the pedophilia scandals in the United States, the clash between Islam and Christianity, the ongoing debates over the Church\u2019s policies regarding women, homosexuals, abortion, AIDS, and other social issues, and much more. A close, trusted observer of the Vatican, Cornwell combines eyewitness reporting with information from the best sources in and outside the pope\u2019s inner circle. Always respectful of John Paul\u2019s prodigious spirit and unrelenting battles for human rights and religious freedom, Cornwell raises serious questions about a system that grants lifetime power to an individual vulnerable to the vicissitudes of aging and illness. The result is a moving, elegiac portrait of John Paul in the winter of his life and a thoughtful, incisive assessment of his legacy to the Church.",

This number will increase drastically over the next decade\u2014as baby boomers tiptoe toward old age; as soldiers return home from war wounded, mentally and physically; as a growing number of Americans find themselves caught between the needs of elderly parents and young children; as medical advances extend lives and health insurance fails to cover them. This compelling book offers both literary solace and guidance to the people who find themselves witness to\u2014and participants in\u2014the fading lives of their intimates.Some of the country's most accomplished writers offer frank insights and revelations about this complex relationship. Julia Glass describes the tension between giving care\u2014to her two young sons\u2014and needing care after being diagnosed with breast cancer; Ann Harleman explores her decision to place her husband in an institution; Sam Lipsyte alternates between dark humor and profound understanding in telling the story of his mother's battle with cancer; Ann Hood wishes she'd had more time as a caregiver, to prepare herself for the loss of her daughter; Andrew Solomon examines the humbling experience of returning as an adult to be cared for by his father; cartoonist Stan Mack offers an illustrated piece about the humor and hell of making his way through the medical bureaucracy alongside his partner, Janet; Julia Alvarez writes about the competition between her and her three sisters to be the best daughter as they tend to their ailing parents. An Uncertain Inheritance examines the caregiving relationship from every angle\u2014children caring for parents; parents caring for children; sib-lings, spouses, and close friends, all looking after one another\u2014to reveal the pain, intimacy, and grace that take place in this meaningful connection.",

        "Authors": "By Holmes, Hannah",
        "Description": "The suburban lawn sprouts a crop of contradictory myths. To some, it's a green oasis; to others, it's eco-purgatory. Science writer Hannah Holmes spent a year appraising the lawn through the eyes of the squirrels, crows, worms, and spiders who think of her backyard as their own. Suburban Safari is a fascinating and often hilarious record of her discoveries: that many animals adore the suburban environment, including bears and cougars venturing in from the woods; how plants, in their struggle for dominance, communicate with their own kind and battle other species; and that ways already exist for us to grow healthier, livelier lawns. Hannah Holmes is the author of The Secret Life of Dust. Her science and travel writing has appeared in publications including the New York Times Magazine, Outside, Sierra, and the Los Angeles Times Magazine. She lives in South Portland, Maine. \"Witty environmentalists are as rare as shy politicians. But in Suburban Safari, Hannah Holmes laughs at herself while celebrating the wild kingdom she explores...Holmes is a science writer who doesn't lecture. She shares the joy of discovery about the secret lives of ants, spiders and crows.\"-USA Today \"Holmes' backyard assumes strange, oversize proportions in the course of this fascinating book: the Bamboo Wilderness, the Insect Nation, the Freedom Lawn-who needs Mongolia?\"-Los Angeles Times \"The writing is punchy and chock-full of strange and wonderful facts...Holmes makes it seem utterly commonplace to invite a chipmunk into one's home or spend the afternoon observing slugs.\"-Oregonian  \"Holmes sends even the most jaded urbanite out into the yard with a magnifying glass and a newly forged sense of awe...One of the most unusual, entertaining, effortlessly educational homages to nature since Euell Gibbons ate a pine tree.\"-Mary Roach, author of Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers",

The question gets to the heart of a set of fundamental questions: What is the purpose of a business? In what ways does a business create value, and whom does it really serve? Can a business promote social causes and yet remain robust, competitive, and profitable?Jeffrey Hollender has run Seventh Generation, the world leader in creating environmentally friendly, nontoxic household and personal care products for more than fifteen years. That the company's success continued through the 90's bubble attests to an unwavering set of principles and behavioral guidelines based on the premise that social responsibility is a viable, vital, and sustainable business strategy. What Matters Most illuminates the successful practices of Seventh Generation--and many other pioneering companies, including Intel, Chiquita, and BP--to demonstrate a corporate strategy that hardwires social and environmental concerns into a company's culture, operating systems, and business relationships. Outlining seven specific principles of corporate responsibility, What Matters Most shows you how to assess your company's performance, address rising consumer expectations, honestly communicate your game plan, and embark on a path of long-term growth. For general readers, What Matters Most is bound to fuel the debate over the role of business in society and the limits to which it can drive positive change.",

For decades, Robert Frank has been asking his economics students to pose and answer questions like these as a way of learning how economic principles operate in the real world--which they do everywhere, all the time.Once you learn to think like an economist, all kinds of puzzling observations start to make sense. Drive-up ATM keypads have Braille dots because it's cheaper to make the same machine for both drive-up and walk-up locations. Travelers from Kansas City to Orlando pay less because they are usually price-sensitive tourists with many choices of destination, whereas travelers originating from Orlando typically choose Kansas City for specific family or business reasons.The Economic Naturalist employs basic economic principles to answer scores of intriguing questions from everyday life, and, along the way, introduces key ideas such as the cost benefit principle, the \"no cash left on the table\" principle, and the law of one price. There is no more delightful and painless way of learning these fundamental principles.",

But, at last, a path has opened in the enormous, overgrown thicket of diet information. This revolutionary book takes information from these weight loss and health management plans and organizes them into a sensible, easy to use reference. There is no other book even remotely like this one-as complete or as useful. The Diet Selector gives readers the skinny on more than 50 ways to lose weight through low- calorie, lowcarbohydrate, or low-fat diets with a thorough discussion on the merits of each approach. It gives the lowdown on popular fasting diets, liquid regimens, surgical solutions, jaw wiring, patches, and pills-every conceivable tactic used today to slim down. The Diet Selector ranks all of the best-known diets with at-aglance icons indicating: how punishing they are, cost of food, whether they\u2019re for quick weight loss or the long haul, popularity, and suitability for people of different ages. Although the information is serious and valuable, the presentation is full of colorful charts, indicating such things as caloric values of key foods and the effectiveness of different exercise regimes. Also in there for fun: diet trivia that includes the first known diet, crazy celebrity trends, and fab or forbidden foods. There are also sample weekly eating plans presented diary-style on a grid with links to relevant websites. Beyond the quest for thin, this volume also addresses how to use nutrition to effectively combat health conditions like allergies, gastrointestinal disorders, thyroid problems, migraines, low metabolism, and heart disease. It truly is the most comprehensive diet book you can buy.",

        "Authors": "By Smolan, Rick and Erwitt, Jennifer",
        "Description": "From the co-author of the New York Times Bestseller America 24/7. The week of September 17, 2007, marked the largest collaborative project in Internet history as 100 of the top photojournalists and millions of Americans documented the concept of home. The result?which included several million photos?is the most extensive record of American home life at the beginning of the 21st century. Now the powerhouse team of photographers and editors behind such bestselling titles as America 24/7 and the A Day in the Life of... series, present their latest collection of stunning personal and dramatic moments with this tie-in volume. America at Home aims to capture the emotions of home: the distinctive rituals, ceremonies, traditions, intimate moments, and all the myriad ways in which we work, play, learn, conduct our lives, and interact with friends, family members (and pets!) as we transform our houses (and apartments, trailers, etc.) into our homes. From McMansions to mobile homes, from tree houses to tenement slums, from ranches to old-age homes, the public was invited to help document the harmonies and paradoxes of home life across America over a single seven-day period... Highlights of this extraordinary project include: Massive grassroots online outreach: Americans were invited to simultaneously contribute their own images via a series of daily snapshots each day throughout the week. These shots covered topics such as: morning rush, what\u2019s for dinner, and evening family rituals. Participants received daily emails with assignment instructions and also took general photos of what makes their home special. The public was able to sign in and upload them at www.MyAmericaAtHome.com. Multiple formats: An international team of leading magazine and newspaper photo editors edited all of the images, shot by both professionals and amateurs. The best images are woven together here with essays from leading writers in a unique and evocative coffee table book. In addition to the website, a TV show and photography exhibit are planned, with the help (and advertising) of major corporate sponsors such as IKEA, Google, HP\u2019s Snapfish, and BabyCenter.com.",

        "Description": "From Yankee Bucky F**ing\u201d Dent\u2019s spirit-shattering home run in the 1978 American League East playoff to Aaron Boone\u2019s pennant-winning blast for the Bombers twenty-five years later; from Roger Clemens\u2019s treasonous signing (at least in Red Sox country) with the Yankees in 1998 to the infamous Curse of the Bambino that started it all, there is nothing in the history of sports more spirited, vitriolic, romantic, and impassioned than the rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The Yankees vs. Red Sox Reader collects the finest writing on what is surely the pinnacle of contentious athletic team competition. A rich array of our most gifted sports writers chronicle an enmity that reaches far beyond the playing field as it is interwoven into the mythologies of these two cities and inextricably linked to the identity of the fans that inhabit them. Chronicling every cheer, jeer, and 1918\u201d (the last year the Red Sox won the World Series) shouted from Fenway to the Bronx, The Yankees vs. Red Sox Reader is an absolute must for not only the fans of these storied franchises, but also anyone interested in the truly epic nature of a great sports rivalry.",

Commander Juan Almeida ? was secretly working with JFK in November 1963 to overthrow\u00a0 Fidel.\u00a0 The US government recently revealed Almeida's work for JFK, allowing the updated trade paperback of Ultimate Sacrifice to tell the full story for the first time (complete with new photos and documents).The authors obtained the story from almost two dozen associates of John and Robert Kennedy, starting in 1990 with JFK's Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Their accounts are supported by thousands of newly-released files at the National Archives.Almeida's \"palace coup\" set for December 1, 1963, was to be backed up by US forces \"invited\" in by Commander Almeida, then Chief of the Cuban Army.\u00a0 However, three Mafia bosses being targeted by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy used several CIA assets to infiltrate the secret plot and murder JFK.This resulted in cover-ups by officials like RFK and LBJ, to prevent the exposure of Almeida and a possible nuclear confrontation with the Soviets. The new edition explains why Almeida was not a double agent, why Fidel suspected Almeida's ally Che Guevara, and what Fidel did in 1990 when he finally found out about Almeida's work for JFK.",

        "Description": "Benjamin, Alepho, and Benson were raised among the Dinka tribe of Sudan. Their world was an insulated, close-knit community of grass-roofed cottages, cattle herders, and tribal councils. The lions and pythons that prowled beyond the village fences were the greatest threat they knew.All that changed the night the government-armed Murahiliin began attacking their villages. Amid the chaos, screams, conflagration, and gunfire, five-year-old Benson and seven-year-old Benjamin fled into the dark night. Two years later, Alepho, age seven, was forced to do the same. Across the Southern Sudan, over the next five years, thousands of other boys did likewise, joining this stream of child refugees that became known as the Lost Boys. Their journey would take them over one thousand miles across a war-ravaged country, through landmine-sown paths, crocodile-infested waters, and grotesque extremes of hunger, thirst, and disease. The refugee camps they eventually filtered through offered little respite from the brutality they were fleeing.In They Poured Fire on Us From the Sky, Alepho, Benson, and Benjamin, by turn, recount their experiences along this unthinkable journey. They vividly recall the family, friends, and tribal world they left far behind them and their desperate efforts to keep track of one another. This is a captivating memoir of Sudan and a powerful portrait of war as seen through the eyes of children. And it is, in the end, an inspiring and unforgettable tribute to the tenacity of even the youngest human spirits.",

        "Description": "George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy-most would agree their presidencies were among the most successful in American history. But what made these very different men such effective leaders? According to presidential historian Gil Troy, these presidents succeeded not because of their bold political visions, but because of their moderation. Although many of the presidential hopefuls for 2008 will claim to be moderates, the word cannot conceal a political climate defined by extreme rhetoric and virulent partisanship. In Leading From the Center, Gil Troy argues that this is a distinctly un-American state of affairs. The great presidents of American history have always sought a golden mean-from Washington, who brilliantly mediated between the competing visions of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, to Lincoln, who rescued the Union with his principled pragmatism, to the two Roosevelts, who united millions of Americans with their powerful, affirmative, nationalist visions. As America lines up to select a president for the future, Gil Troy astutely reminds us of the finest traditions of presidential leadership from our nation&#39;s past.",

        "Description": "FIRST IN WAR, FIRST IN PEACE, FIRST IN LEADERSHIP. Richard Brookhiser\u2019s revolutionary biography, Founding Father, took George Washington off the dollar bill and made him live. Now, with his trademark wit and precision, Brookhiser expertly examines the details of Washington\u2019s life that fullscale biographies sweep over, to instruct us in true leadership. George Washington on Leadership is a textbook look at Washington\u2019s three spectacularly successful careers as an executive: general, president, and tycoon. Brookhiser explains how Washington maximized his strengths and overcame his flaws, and inspires us to do likewise. It shows how one man\u2019s struggles and successes 200 years ago can be a model for leaders today. Washington oversaw two startups-the army and the presidency. He chaired the most important meeting in American history-the Constitutional Convention. Washington rose from being a third son who was a major in the militia, to one of the most famous men in the world. At every stage in his career, he had to deal with changing circumstances, from tobacco prices to geopolitics, and with wildly different classes of men, from frontiersmen to aristocrats. Washington\u2019s example is so crucial because of the many firsts he is responsible for.",

        "Title": "The Reagan I Knew",
        "Authors": "By Buckley, William F.",
        "Description": "In The Regan I Knew, the late William F. Buckley Jr. offers a reminiscence of thirty years of friendship with the man who brought the American conservative movement out of the political wilderness and into the White House. Ronald Reagan and Buckley were political allies and close friends throughout Reagan\u2019s political career. They went on vacations together and shared inside jokes. When Reagan was elected president, Buckley wrote him to say that Reagan should not offer him any position in the new administration; Reagan wrote back saying he had hoped to appoint Buckley U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan (then under Soviet occupation). For the rest of his term, Reagan called Buckley ?Mr. Ambassador.\u201d On the day the Soviets withdrew, he wrote Buckley to congratulate him for single-handedly driving out the Red Army ?without ever leaving Kabul.\u201dYet for all the words that have been written about him, Ronald Reagan remains an enigma. His former speechwriter Peggy Noonan called him ?paradox all the way down,\u201d and even his son Ron Reagan despaired of ever truly knowing him. But Reagan was not an enigma to William F. Buckley Jr. They understood and taught each other for decades, and together they changed history.This book presents an American political giant as seen by another giant, who knew him perhaps better than anyone else. It is the most revealing portrait of Ronald Reagan the world is likely to have.",

        "Description": "The status of the United States as a world power, and the nature of power itself, are at a historic turning point. It is essential that we understand and adapt to the new security environment in which we find ourselves.Two of the most respected figures in American foreign policy are Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft?both former National Security Advisors under markedly different administrations. In America and the World they dissect, in spontaneous and unscripted conversations moderated by David Ignatius, the most significant foreign policy challenges facing the U.S.: the Middle East, Russia, China, Europe, the Developing World, the changing nature of power in a globalized world, and what Brzezinski has called the ?global political awakening.\u201d While one author is a Republican and the other a Democrat, they broadly agree on the need to adapt to a new international environment. Where they disagree, their exchanges are always both deeply informed and provocative.America and the World will define the center of responsible opinion on American foreign policy at a time when the nation\u2019s decisions could determine how long it remains a superpower.",
