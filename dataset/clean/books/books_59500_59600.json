When investigative journalist Rhoda Gradwyn arrived there one late autumn afternoon, scheduled to have a disfiguring and long-standing facial scar removed, she had every expectation of a successful operation and a pleasant week recuperating.Two days later she was dead, the victim of murder.To Commander Adam Dalgliesh, who with his team is called in to investigate the case, the mystery at first seems absolute. Few things about it make sense. Yet as the detectives begin probing the lives and backgrounds of those connected with the dead woman\u2014the surgeon, members of the manor staff, close acquaintances\u2014suspects multiply all too rapidly. New confusions arise, including strange historical overtones of madness and a lynching 350 years in the past. Then there is a second murder, and Dalgliesh finds himself confronted by issues even more challenging than innocence or guilt.P. D. James has gained an enviable reputation for creating detective stories of uncommon depth and intricacy, combined with the sort of humanity and perceptiveness found only in the finest novelists. The Private Patient ranks among her very best.",

Get on Tachibana's bad side, and life becomes hell. When Hatsumi has to buy a pregnancy test because her popular sister Akane is late, Mrs. Tachibana's son, Ryoki, who used to bully Hatsumi as a kid, promises not to tell the world about Hatsumi's secret, only if she becomes his slave. Suddenly Azusa, Hatsumi's protector in their youth, reappears to save her again! He's moving back into the neighbourhood! Despite the budding romance between Hatsumi and Azusa, Ryoki has control over her through the secret that could ruin the lives of everyone in Hatsumi's family, and he hasn't forgotten who his slave is!   But she says he's just a friend...Well that's not how Ryoki feels. His New Year's fete with our hapless heroine Hatsumi didn't go according to plan, so childhood bully/potential boyfriend Ryoki hightails it back home in a huff. Luckily, Hatsumi's heavenly older brother Shinogu is there to give her a lift back to civilization. A botched burglary at the Narita household leaves Hatsumi panicky and, in an act that goes way against character, Ryoki lends her a hand, but their affections do not go unseen. Will Hatsumi and Ryoki's feelings be able to survive the harsh scrutiny of company-housing life?",

        "Title": "The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History",
        "Authors": "By Bobbitt, Philip",
        "Description": "\"We are at a moment in world affairs when the essential ideas that govern statecraft must change. For five centuries it has taken the resources of a state to destroy another state . . . This is no longer true, owing to advances in international telecommunications, rapid computation, and weapons of mass destruction. The change in statecraft that will accompany these developments will be as profound as any that the State has thus far undergone.\"\u2014from the PrologueThe Shield of Achilles is a classic inquiry into the nature of the State, its origin in war, and its drive for peace and legitimacy. Philip Bobbitt, a professor of constitutional law and a historian of nuclear strategy, has served in the White House, the Senate, the State Department, and the National Security Council in both Democratic and Republican administrations, and here he brings his formidable experience and analytical gifts to bear on our changing world. Many have observed that the nation-state is dying, yet others have noted that the power of the State has never been greater. Bobbitt reconciles this paradox and introduces the idea of the market-state, which is already replacing its predecessor. Along the way he treats such themes as the Long War (which began in 1914 and ended in 1990). He explains the relation of violence to legitimacy, and the role of key individuals in fates that are partially\u2014but only partially\u2014determined.This book anticipates the coalitional war against terrorism and lays out alternative futures for the world. Bobbitt shows how nations might avoid the great power confrontations that have a potential for limitless destruction, and he traces the origin and evolution of the State to such wars and the peace conferences that forged their outcomes into law, from Augsburg to Westphalia to Utrecht to Vienna to Versailles.The author paints a powerful portrait of the ever-changing interrelatedness of our world, and he uses his expertise in law and strategy to discern the paths that statehood will follow in the coming years and decades. Timely and perceptive, The Shield of Achilles will change the way we think about the world.",

        "Title": "Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution",
        "Authors": "By Behe, Michael J.",
        "Description": "Virtually all serious scientists accept the truth of Darwin's theory of evolution. While the fight for its acceptance has been a long and difficult one, after a century of struggle among the cognoscenti the battle is over. Biologists are now confident that their remaining questions, such as how life on Earth began, or how the Cambrian explosion could have produced so many new species in such a short time, will be found to have Darwinian answers. They, like most of the rest of us, accept Darwin's theory to be true.  But should we? What would happen if we found something that radically challenged the now-accepted wisdom? In Darwin's Black Box, Michael Behe argues that evidence of evolution's limits has been right under our noses -- but it is so small that we have only recently been able to see it. The field of biochemistry, begun when Watson and Crick discovered the double-helical shape of DNA, has unlocked the secrets of the cell. There, biochemists have unexpectedly discovered a world of Lilliputian complexity. As Belie engagingly demonstrates, using the examples of vision, bloodclotting, cellular transport, and more, the biochemical world comprises an arsenal of chemical machines, made up of finely calibrated, interdependent parts. For Darwinian evolution to be true, there must have been a series of mutations, each of which produced its own working machine, that led to the complexity we can now see. The more complex and interdependent each machine's parts are shown to be, the harder it is to envision Darwin's gradualistic paths, Behe surveys the professional science literature and shows that it is completely silent on the subject, stymied by the elegance of the foundation of life. Could it be that there is some greater force at work? Michael Behe is not a creationist. He believes in the scientific method, and he does not look to religious dogma for answers to these questions. But he argues persuasively that biochemical machines must have been designed -- either by God, or by some other higher intelligence. For decades science has been frustrated, trying to reconcile the astonishing discoveries of modern biochemistry to a nineteenth-century theory that cannot accommodate them. With the publication of Darwin's Black Box, it is time for scientists to allow themselves to consider exciting new possibilities, and for the rest of us to watch closely.",

        "Title": "Who Moved the Stone?",
        "Authors": "By Morrison, Frank",
        "Description": "\"I owe Morison a great debt of gratitude. Who Moved the Stone? was an important early link in a long chain of evidence that God used to bring me into his kingdom. Morison\u2019s stirring intellectual exploration of the historical record proved to be an excellent starting point for my spiritual investigation.\" --From the foreword by Lee Strobel English journalist Frank Morison had a tremendous drive to learn of Christ. The strangeness of the Resurrection story had captured his attention, and, influenced by skeptic thinkers at the turn of the century, he set out to prove that the story of Christ\u2019s Resurrection was only a myth. His probings, however, led him to discover the validity of the biblical record in a moving, personal way. Who Moved the Stone? is considered by many to be a classic apologetic on the subject of the Resurrection. Morison includes a vivid and poignant account of Christ\u2019s betrayal, trial, and death as a backdrop to his retelling of the climactic Resurrection itself. Among the chapter titles are: * The Book That Refused to Be Written * The Real Case Against the Prisoner * What Happened Before Midnight on Thursday * Between Sunset and Dawn * The Witness of the Great Stone * Some Realities of That Far-off Morning Who Moved the Stone? is a well-researched book that is as fascinating in its appeal to reason as it is accurate to the truthfulness of the Resurrection.",

        "Description": "The need for clarity and precision in legal writing has become increasingly apparent in recent years.  Until this award-winning book appeared, the unwieldy body of legal language had not been collected or scrutinized in any systematic way.      Far more than a typical law dictionary, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage is the first and only comprehensive guide to style and usage for the legal writer. Bryan A. Garner, an editor, academic, and practicing lawyer has written an accessible, authoritative, and up-to-date guide that will help anyone in the legal thicket write better, including lawyers, judges, students, journalists, and those who work in other fields concerned with law (among them medicine, business, and finance).      At once scholarly and entertaining, the alphabetical entries define and distinguish between commonly misused words; explain standard usages that other reference works ignore; and cumulatively provide an unparalleled guide to legal style.  On virtually every page, the volume contains sparkling essays on such topics as metaphors, sexism, cliches, Latinisms, danglers, split infinitives, and purple prose.  It also brims with actual illustrations from judicial opinions, statutes, briefs, and law review articles.      Already viewed as the classic book in its field, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage fills an important gap in legal reference literature.",

One                 night he lay down in the wilderness to sleep and had one of the                 great mystical experiences of Western religion. He dreamed                 there was a ladder, with angels ascending and descending,                 stretched between heaven and earth. For thousands of years,                 people have tried to overhear what the messengers came down to                 tell Jacob, and us.              Now in a daring blend of scholarship and                 imagination, psychology and history, Lawrence Kushner gathers                 an inspiring range of interpretations of Genesis 28:16 given by                 sages, from Shmuel bar Nachmani in third-century Palestine to                 Hannah Rachel Werbermacher of Ludomir who lived in Poland two                 hundred years ago. Through a fascinating new literary genre and                 Kushner\u2019s creative reconstruction of the teachers\u2019                 lives and times, we enter the study halls and sit at the feet                 of these spiritual masters to learn what each discovered about                 God\u2019s Self and ourselves as they ascend and descend                 Jacob\u2019s ladder.              In this illuminating journey, our                 spiritual guides ask and answer the fundamental questions of                 human experience: Who am I? Who is God? What is God\u2019s                 role in history? What is the nature of evil? How should I                 relate to God and other people? Could the universe really have                 a self?              Rabbi Lawrence Kushner brilliantly                 reclaims a millennium of Jewish spirituality for contemporary                 seekers of all faiths and backgrounds. God Was in This Place & I, i Did Not Know is about God and about you; it is about                 discovering God\u2019s place in the universe, and yours.",

        "Description": "This superb text by David Bohm, formerly Princeton University and Emeritus Professor of Theoretical Physics at Birkbeck College, University of London, provides a formulation of the quantum theory in terms of qualitative and imaginative concepts that have evolved outside and beyond classical theory. Although it presents the main ideas of quantum theory essentially in nonmathematical terms, it follows these with a broad range of specific applications that are worked out in considerable mathematical detail. Addressed primarily to advanced undergraduate students, the text begins with a study of the physical formulation of the quantum theory, from its origin and early development through an analysis of wave vs. particle properties of matter. In Part II, Professor Bohm addresses the mathematical formulation of the quantum theory, examining wave functions, operators, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, fluctuations, correlations, and eigenfunctions.Part III takes up applications to simple systems and further extensions of quantum theory formulation, including matrix formulation and spin and angular momentum. Parts IV and V explore the methods of approximate solution of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation and the theory of scattering. In Part VI, the process of measurement is examined along with the relationship between quantum and classical concepts.Throughout the text, Professor Bohm places strong emphasis on showing how the quantum theory can be developed in a natural way, starting from the previously existing classical theory and going step by step through the experimental facts and theoretical lines of reasoning which led to replacement of the classical theory by the quantum theory.",

But it takes something else, something more than courage to keep HIM going when every instinct, every shred of reason dictates that he do otherwise.This hard truth becomes self-evident when the men belonging to Recon Team Kilo, a Special Forces A team operating deep in hostile territory, is overwhelmed by indigenous forces. Stripped of their leadership and unit cohesion, the survivors struggle to stay faithful to a code of conduct in the face of brutal imprisonment and an uncertain future. Isolated from their brethren, each man is forced to rely upon his own skills and strengths. Some rise to the occasion with a defiance that is unnerving to their captors and some draw upon an inner grace that sees them through their darkest hours. Others, alone and suffering, find themselves wavering as they are hammered by an unending drumbeat of depraved cruelty.The challenges faced by those selected to rescue the men of Recon Team Kilo are no less daunting, the catalysts that propel them and see them through any diverse. For Robert Delmont, Special Ops Plans Officer, a compelling need for atonement colors his recommendations. He steers the Army's senior leadership toward a course of action that allows him to become an active participant.Courage is not a factor for the commander of the unit selected to execute Delmont's plan. A dedicated professional, Lieutenant Colonel Harry Shaddock has no doubt that the men under his command will follow him anywhere--even into an operation designed to save fellow soldiers while putting his own in harm's way.While Dermont, Shaddock, and other members of the armed forces bend their collective efforts to save the survivors of Recon Team Kilo, the families of those men must endure a trial no less daunting. They must find a way to deal with their fears and their emotions as they stand on the sidelines watching their loved ones killed off, one by one, by a ruthless foe in a contest that demands more of them than any had imagined. In order to triumph, all must reach out and draw upon something within, something more than courage.",
