        "Title": "The Squandering of America: How the Failure of Our Politics Undermines Our Prosperity",
        "Authors": "By Kuttner, Robert",
        "Description": "The incomes of most Americans today are static or declining. Tens of millions of workers are newly vulnerable to layoffs and outsourcing. Health care and retirement burdens are increasingly being shifted from employers to individuals. Two-income families find they are working longer hours for lower wages, with decreased social support. As wealth has become more concentrated, the economy has become more recklessly speculative, jeopardizing not only the prospects of ordinary Americans, but the solvency of the entire system. What links these trends, writes Robert Kuttner in this provocative, engaging, and necessary book, is the consolidation of political and economic power by a narrow elite, who blocks the ability of government to restore broad prosperity to the majority of citizens.Kuttner\u2014one of our most lucid economic critics\u2014explores the roots of these problems and outlines a persuasive, bold alternative. In BusinessWeek, The Boston Globe, and The American Prospect, he has established himself as a prophetic voice connecting economics and politics. Here he demonstrates how our economy has fallen hostage to a casino of financial speculation, creating instability as well as inequality. He debunks alarmist claims about supposed economic hazards, such as Social Security and Medicare, and exposes the genuine dangers: hedge funds and private equity run amok, sub-prime lenders, Wall Street middlemen, and America\u2019s dependence on foreign central banks. He describes how globalization of commerce has been used by business less to promote free trade than to escape the balanced regulation that delivered widespread abundance in the decades after World War II.While our financial security has weakened under President George W. Bush, Kuttner also faults many Democrats for failing to offer compelling alternatives. Now, with financial markets in crisis and public opinion supporting a more active role for government, he offers a new model of managed capitalism that can deliver security and opportunity, and rekindle democracy as a check on concentrated wealth.Here is a passionate, articulate naming of the problem and a call for reform. The Squandering of America sets out a path for reclaiming our democratic politics\u2014and our prosperity.",

        "Title": "American Business - A Two Minute Warning",
        "Authors": "By Grayson, C. Jackson, Jr. and O'Dell, Carla",
        "Description": "In less than two decades -- about \"two minutes\" in world history time -- Japan will succeed the United States as the world's productivity leader, and in the twenty-first century this Pacific nation will become the world's economic leader. The United States will drop back to number two or three in the global economy, burdened with a large foreign debt, and faced with a relatively lower standard of living, following the path of decline of Great Britain and other former world leaders.  So predict C. Jackson Grayson, Jr., and Carla O'Dell, two of the world's leading authorities on productivity, unless American government, management, and labor can work together-and soon -- to revive American productivity growth and bolster the quality of American products and services. Showing how hundreds of companies including Xerox, Federal Express, Ford, IBM, and Motorola are successfully responding to the competitive challenge, the authors make a compelling case that American industry can benefit from the lessons of history, learn to adjust, and thus retain its world economic leadership.  Speaking directly to managers, Grayson and O'Dell offer a wealth of practical suggestions for American business in their specific ten-part \"Agenda for Adjustment.\" Based on their experience with successful firms, the Agenda spells out workable recommendations for improvement -- from operating systems and organization structure, to employment stability and compensation systems.  American Business: A Two-Minute Warning also addresses the role of government in industrial revitalization. Grayson and O'Dell contend that much of what is recommended for government action tackles the wrong problems. Not only will such proposed responses fail, they argue, but they will make the situation worse. They then make specific suggestions for what government should -- and should not -- do.  The stakes are enormous. Few single issues will have a greater impact than productivity and quality on the everyday lives, aspirations, and futures of Americans and their children. Grayson and O'Dell's message' grow or decline. A two-minute warning. And there are no timeouts left.",

        "Authors": "By Scott, Pamela and Lee, Antoinette J.",
        "Description": "Series copy: America's architectural heritage is incredibly rich--from Alaska's log cabins and Iowa's silos, to Michigan's automobile plants and the District of Columbia's monuments. Now, in Buildings of the United States, a monumental project commissioned by the Society of Architecural Historians, we have the first state-by-state survey American architecture reflecting the geographic, climatic, and ethnic diversity of the country.  It records the works of national and international masters of American architecture, as well as works by unknown hands. From pre-Columbian ruins to modern skyscrapers, from churches, courthouses, and theatres, to factories, barns, and gas stations, the volumes balance coverage of urban, suburban, and rural architecture. The authors of the volumes are architectural historians with a distinct and thorough knowledge of the states about which they have written. Each volume is profusely illustrated with photographs and line drawings, many of which were commissioned for the work.    Destined to become a national treasure, Buildings of the United States is the authoritative reference on our architectural heritage and will become delight to the general reader and traveler as well as an indispensable source book for scholars and students of architectural history, preservation, and urban planning.      The public architecture of Washington D.C. is well-known throughout the world. The Capitol, the White House, and other major monuments are familiar to millions of people who have never visited the city. Less familiar are many notable public and private buildings located in the central city and scattered throughout Washington's residential neighborhoods, ranging from the eighteenth-century port city of Georgetown to the mid-twentieth-century urban renewal area known as the Southwest Quadrant.    Tracing the evolution of the district's architectrual character from the Revolutionary War to the present, Pamela Scott and Antoinette J. Lee survey major public and government buildings, monuments and memorials, residential buildings and neighborhoods, parks and recreational areas, and commercial and industrial centers. From the Vietnam Memorial, the Smithsonian Institution, and the United States Patent Office to Howard and Georgetown universities, nineteenth-century row houses, and elegant Beaux-Arts mansions, this volume captures the full array of Washington's architecural styles.    Containing over 360 magnificent photographs, drawings, and maps, Buildings of the District of Columbia is a compelling source of information for the general reader, and a splendid guidebook for the traveler.",

        "Authors": "By Wilson, George C.",
        "Description": "Drawing on nearly 40 years of news writing focused on military issues, George C. Wilson takes the reader through a fascinating, but little understood, process: how the Pentagon and Congress spend $500,000 a minute on guns and soldiers. Interweaving personal stories and insights from the major players throughout a fast-paced narrative, Wilson provides an inside look at how the 105th Congress and the Pentagon battled for a 250 billion dollar defense budget.Wilson demystifies the \"realpolitik\" among the individual armed forces and highly partisan members of Congress, as well as civilian and military leaders, thus giving a sense of the trade-offs involved on all sides. Exclusive interviews with major players\u2014including Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, Rep. David R. Obey, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Hugh H. Shelton\u2014relate their distinctive perspectives on how Congress allocates and the Pentagon spends defense dollars.Wilson takes a look ahead\u2014with a critical eye\u2014to the wars of the next century and asks tough questions: Are we ready for future wars or are we still preparing for the last war, the Cold War? Does the Pentagon need more money? Or can it really do its job with less?",

        "Description": "How did it come to pass that, not so long after 9/11 brought the free world to our side, U.S. foreign policy is in a shambles? In this thought-provoking book, the renowned peace negotiator Dennis Ross argues that the Bush administration\u2019s problems stem from its inability to use the tools of statecraft\u2014diplomatic, economic, and military\u2014to advance our interests.Statecraft is as old as politics: Plato wrote about it, Machiavelli practiced it. After the demise of Communism, some predicted that statecraft would wither away. But Ross explains that in the globalized world\u2014with its fluid borders, terrorist networks, and violent unrest\u2014statecraft is necessary simply to keep the peace.In illuminating chapters, he outlines how statecraft helped shape a new world order after 1989. He shows how the failure of statecraft in Iraq and the Middle East has undercut the United States internationally, and makes clear that only statecraft can check the rise of China and the danger of a nuclear Iran. He draws on his expertise to reveal the art of successful negotiation. And he shows how the next president could resolve today\u2019s problems and define a realistic, ambitious foreign policy.Statecraft is essential reading for anyone interested in foreign policy\u2014or concerned about America\u2019s place in the world.",

Lia's parents, Foua and Nao Kao, were part of a large Hmong community in Merced, refugees from the CIA-run \"Quiet War\" in Laos. The Hmong, traditionally a close-knit and fiercely people, have been less amenable to assimilation than most immigrants, adhering steadfastly to the rituals and beliefs of their ancestors. Lia's pediatricians, Neil Ernst and his wife, Peggy Philip, cleaved just as strongly to another tradition: that of Western medicine. When Lia Lee Entered the American medical system, diagnosed as an epileptic, her story became a tragic case history of cultural miscommunication.Parents and doctors both wanted the best for Lia, but their ideas about the causes of her illness and its treatment could hardly have been more different. The Hmong see illness aand healing as spiritual matters linked to virtually everything in the universe, while medical community marks a division between body and soul, and concerns itself almost exclusively with the former. Lia's doctors ascribed her seizures to the misfiring of her cerebral neurons; her parents called her illness, qaug dab peg--the spirit catches you and you fall down--and ascribed it to the wandering of her soul. The doctors prescribed anticonvulsants; her parents preferred animal sacrifices.",

        "Authors": "By Bailey, Paul (EDT)",
        "Description": "All great cities inspire great literature, but no other city has so consistently stimulated the literary imagination as London. Over the centuries writers, poets, historians, artists, and simple observers have chronicled the life and growth of the capital from its humble beginnings to the teeming metropolis it is today. In his sparkling anthology Paul Bailey has captured the essence of London's allure for visitors and inhabitants--from the Middle Ages to the present day--with wit, humor, and pathos. Among the many contributors are those whose evocations of the city have forever fixed it in the popular mind: Charles Dickens's descriptions of fogbound London streets, the bustle and hustle of the Victorian city; Ben Jonson's satires on London low life from 1616; William Wordsworth rhapsodizing on the view from Westminster Bridge; George Bernard Shaw's archetypal Cockney, Eliza Doolittle. Less well known but equally vivid are descriptions of everyday life for the down and out and the aristocrat, of the museums, theaters, galleries and churches, the restaurants and pubs, the parks and institutions, the topography of London mapped out in unforgettable verse and prose. The great set pieces, Daniel Defoe's description of the Plague year, John Evelyn's and Samuel Pepys's daily records of the Great Fire, join eyewitness accounts of coronations and funerals, unequaled in their immediacy. The bemusement of foreign visitors, the joys and horrors of London buses and the London Underground, the sprawl of the suburbs and the excitement of the city, all add to the dazzling panorama. Beginning in 1180 or thereabouts, with a monk named William Fitzstephen enumerating the delights of the capital, and ending in the present day, The Oxford Book of London offers an unparalleled introduction and tribute to this fascinating city. Armchair travellers, anyone planning to visit London, and those interested in fine writing will gain a sense of the ways in which the city has grown and changed over eight centuries.",

        "Description": "With its balanced approach to reading instruction, Reading and Learning to Read, 5/e, remains a comprehensive, active learning tool that encourages students to teach reading in ways that are both meaningful and reflective. Rather than emphasizing a traditional skills-based approach, this book focuses on teaching skills within a meaning-centered approach. This includes an emphasis on literature-based reading instruction, the integration of technology into the teaching of reading, and the integration of reading and writing instruction.    This book continues to promote a contemporary, balanced approach to teaching reading and writing with a renewed emphasis on integrating technology, accommodating the needs of diverse learners, and teaching the middle school young adolescent. Given the increasingly focused interest on literacy standards in the teaching of reading world-wide, this edition also highlights practical examples and references that exemplify the International Reading Associations Standards for Reading Professionals. User friendly marginal icons highlight each of these new features, making them easy to locate for classroom discussion. Additionally, this updated edition features a new section in each chapter that discusses pertinent issues regarding struggling with readers, a recurring concern of classroom teachers. Web sites are also included at the end of each chapter that direct the reader to online practical resources on a variety topics.     Designed for anyone interested in elementary reading methods, reading in the elementary school, and developmental reading.",

        "Title": "Educational Psychology: Theory and Practice, Seventh Edition",
        "Authors": "By Slavin, Robert E.",
        "Description": "This popular book from renowned educational psychologist Robert Slavin translates theory into practices that teachers can use in their classrooms with a further inquiry into the concept of intentionality. An \"intentional teacher,\" according to Slavin, is one who constantly reflects on his or her practices and makes instructional decisions based on a clear conception of how these practices affect students. To help readers become \"intentional teachers,\" the author offers a set of questions to guide them and models best practices through classroom examples.     Educational Psychology prepares teachers as no other text does.

No one who lived through those days in the late summer of 1997 will ever forget the unprecedented outpourings of grief, shock, and anger that followed. And in the days leading up to her funeral, it seemed as if the whole of humanity had spontaneously united to mourn her loss.But who was this young woman who had come to symbolize so much to so many? How was it that she could reach out to touch lives not only of whole communities but individuals, too? What lay behind her inspiration-and what will be the lasting impact of her legacy?No book yet written about Diana has come close to the person so many people speak of as having been a beacon of light in their lives. Here, for the first time, is the Diana that many of those closest to her knew.Written with the full cooperation of the late princess's estate, Diana: The Portrait tells Diana's story through her own words and the words of people, both famous, and, until now, unknown. Beautifully designed, it is a lavishly illustrated with nearly 500 images of Diana, including many pictures never previously published, taken from sources including the Spencer family archive, the Althorp Museum, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund archive, and the private collections of the friends, charities, and individuals whose lives she touched.Drawing on over 200 original interviews, including those of family members and friends, many of whom have never spoken before, this remarkable book will stand as a unique and lasting testament to the life and work of one of the extraordinary and enduring icons of the 20th century.",

        "Description": "No one can deny that our culture is opposed to Christian values, and the influences bombarding our children\u2019s moral development can be deadly. But few parents and church leaders realize how critical it is to start developing a child\u2019s biblical worldview from the very earliest years of life. The problem is complex: parents who themselves did not receive early spiritual training leave their children\u2019s training to the church. Yet the church often focuses on older children\u2014not realizing that a child\u2019s moral development is set by the age of nine. The answer is for churches to recognize the need to come alongside parents to provide them biblical worldview training, parenting information, counseling, etc., that will equip them to help their children become the spiritually matuare Church of tomorrow. Profiles presented of churches who are effectively ministering to children and winning the war our enemy is waging against them\\.

        "Description": "\"I have no hesitation in describing Bananas, Beaches and Bases as the most significant book in contemporary feminist International Politics. Each time I re-visit it, I am taken aback by its profound implications for both feminism and International Politics. The deceptively provocative question at its core--'where are the women?'--irrevocably transforms our views about what the central and important landscape of global politics is. In my view, it is the essential text not only for feminist International Politics courses but for anyone interested in starting to understand just how International Politics really works.\"--Marysia Zalewski, author of Feminism After Postmodernism: Theorising Through Practice\"A new edition of Bananas, Beaches, and Bases is cause for cosmic good cheer. This trailblazing treatment of the gender politics of global market and military projects is a feminist classic. Always ahead of the curve, before globalization had achieved cache in academic circles Enloe was there, cajoling Western feminists out of our political parochialism. There is no more creative, insightful, engaging feminist guide to international politics. Cynthia Enloe is an international feminist treasure, and Bananas, Beaches, and Bases her signature work.\"--Judith Stacey, author of Brave New Families\"Bananas, Beaches, and Bases is both a 'Pandora's Box' and a roadmap: It unleashes questions and insights that many conventional students of International Politics are accustomed to ignoring or overlooking about the dynamic between gender and international political life, and it guides us to see how both are mutually constitutive. As the \"magna carta\" of Feminist International Relations, it has helped create a new generation of women and men in the world of international relations.\"--Katharine Moon, author of Sex Among Allies\"Cynthia Enloe writes with passion, conviction, intelligence and verve as she makes such good feminist sense of international politics that the world never looks quite the same again. Innovative and a great read, Bananas, Beaches and Bases continues to be an outstanding example of the difference gender makes in social analysis. This is a book which provokes discussion with students, colleagues, friends and family. It is a book which has set the standard form much that followed. A classic.\"--Diane Bell, author of Ngarrindjeri Wurrurwarrin: A World That Is, Was, and Will Be\"With this volume, Cynthia Enloe single-handedly carved out a major new field. Combining contemporary political insight and historical sensitivity, Bananas, Beaches and Bases revealed the gendered workings of high politics, without which the entire machinery of war, diplomacy and governance would have long since collapsed.

When he hits a lonely stretch of Colorado highway, he spies something that will shake up his gilded life in ways he can't imagine. A young woman . . . dressed in a beaver suit. Blue Bailey is on a mission to murder her ex. Or at least inflict serious damage. As for the beaver suit she's wearing . . . Is it her fault that life keeps throwing her curveballs? Witness the expensive black sports car pulling up next to her on the highway and the Greek god stepping out of it.Blue's career as a portrait painter is the perfect job for someone who refuses to stay in one place for very long. She needs a ride, and America's most famous football player has an imposing set of wheels.

Running his ramshackle saloon in the frigid North is far from the life Rachel envisions for herself - especially when she loses her heart to explorer Noel Magnus. But Magnus's sweet kisses are accompanied by promises of marriage that Rachel fears he will never fulfill.A wealthy New York publisher, Magnus gave up an elegant bachelor's existence to lead an Arctic expedition in search of the doomed Franklin party - and the famed black opal Franklin reportedly found. Lovely Rachel is the reason he docks at Herschel Island whenever he can. But the tundra is a far more demanding mistress than any woman, and when he doesn't return home, New York society believes it has taken his life. Magnus is willing to let the world mourn his \"death\" if it means conquering the Arctic - and retrieving the opal.Only Rachel knows where the gem is hidden. Convinced that her dream of a life with Magnus can never be realized, Rachel decides to pursue what her errant lover has rejected - his New York home and her own happiness. But the modest cottage Rachel imagined is an opulent mansion, and the quiet existence she dreams of as his \"widow\" is immediately complicated by new demands. Rachel never dreams that Magnus - who is furious that he must choose between the lure of adventure and the \"wife\" who has stolen his heart - will one day follow her.",

        "Description": "There Is No Me Without You is the story of Haregewoin Tefarra, a middle-aged Ethiopian woman of modest means whose home has become a refuge for hundreds of children orphaned by AIDS. It is a story as much about the power of the bond between children and parents as about the epidemic that every year leaves millions of children, mostly healthy themselves, without family. Originally a middle-class woman with a happy family life, Haregewoin fell into a deep depression after the death of her recently married daughter. But then a priest brought her two children, AIDS orphans, with nowhere to go. Unexpectedly, the children thrived, and Haregewoin found herself drawn back into daily life. As word got out, an endless stream of children began to arrive at her door, delivered by dying parents and other relatives who begged for her help, and, pushing against the limits of her home and bank account, she took more and more in. Today, Haregewoin runs a school, a daycare system, and a shelter for sick mothers. Without medication for her charges\u2014some HIV-positive, some uninfected, and some infants trying to fight off the virus, but almost all of whom come to her terrified and malnourished\u2014she forges on, caring for as many as she can handle. Increasingly, she also places them for adoption with families like that of journalist Melissa Fay Greene, who has two children adopted from Ethiopia. In Haregewoin Tefarra\u2019s story, Greene gives us an astonishing portrait of a woman fighting a continent-wide epidemic.",

With a staff of thirty-eight thousand people, it dwarfs the CIA in budget, manpower, and influence. Recent headlines have linked it to economic espionage throughout Europe and to the ongoing hunt for the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.James Bamford first penetrated the wall of silence surrounding the NSA in 1982, with the much-talked-about bestseller The Puzzle Palace. In Body of Secrets, he offers shocking new details about the inner workings of the agency, gathered through unique access to thousands of internal documents and interviews with current and former officials. Unveiling extremely sensitive information for the first time, Bamford exposes the role the NSA played in numerous Soviet bloc Cold War conflicts and discusses its undercover involvement in the Vietnam War. His investigation into the NSA's technological advances during the last fifteen years brings to light a network of global surveillance ranging from on-line listening posts to sophisticated intelligence-gathering satellites. In a hard-hitting conclusion, he warns that the NSA is a two-edged sword. While its worldwide eavesdropping activities offer the potential for tracking down terrorists and uncovering nuclear weapons deals, it also has the capability to listen in on global personal communications.",

By Robin HahnelBoom and BustAmong economic systems, capitalism is the manic-depressive patient. Exuberance, unbridled optimism, and euphoria are followed by gloom, listlessness, and depression. But no matter how often the cycle is repeated the patient always believes the latest boom will last forever, only to feel foolish again when the bubble bursts. And no matter how often the patient reverts to manic behavior when taken off medication, the economic \"psychiatric\" establishment eventually succumbs to the patient's pleas to be taken off medication during the \"ups\"-freeing the exuberant economy from policy restraints-only to insist on placing the patient back on meds-re-application of necessary policy protections-when the unmedicated patient \"crashes.\"The Latest BoomThe truth is that neither part of capitalism's manic-depressive boom-and-bust cycle is \"healthy.\" Like most capitalist booms, the benefits of global liberalization during the 1980s and 1990s were not all they were made out to be. In fact, most people in the world were worse off economically at the end of the latest boom than they had been when it began-that is, even before the over-hyped boom metamorphosed into the global economic crisis of 1997-98. How is this possible, you ask? We were told \"the world economy grew at 3 percent a year in the 1980s and 2 percent in the first half of the 1990s,\" and that \"low- and middle-income economies grew more rapidly, averaging 3.4 percent growth in the 1980s and 5 percent in the 1990s.\" We were assured that \"growth in trade from increased trade liberalization that has gone hand-in-hand with increased private capital flows and financial integration,\"",

        "Authors": "By Gardner, Howard and Laskin, Emma (COM)",
        "Description": "While much has been written on the subject, a crucial component of leadership has been largely ignored: the mind of the leader and the minds of his or her followers. Linking the study of creativity and leadership, Gardner demonstrates the strong tie between traditional creators (artists and scientists) and leaders in the realms of business, politics, and the military.Gardner claims that the key to leadership is the creation and embodiment of an effective story. He argues that unless they're working with specialists, leaders must deal with the \"unschooled mind.\" They must take into account the fundamental theories about the world that all of us acquire as children and that persist through life - even when those theories are later undermined by what we learn in school. In striking portraits of a wide range of leaders - from J. Robert Oppenheimer to Alfred P. Sloan, from Margaret Mead to Pope John XXIII to Mahatma GandhiGardner recreates the leaders' stories and depicts the struggles among rival stories that occur in the minds of an audience. He explains the overwhelming appeal of simplistic stories and enumerates the key moves needed to counter that appeal. He also describes the ways in which all leaders ultimately confront failure.In a powerful conclusion, Gardner identifies the six constant features of leadership, six trends that complexify leadership in our time, and the paradoxes that must be resolved for leadership to be effective.",

It was with this exercise philosophy firmly in place that she set off to complete a marathon. The Nonrunner's Marathon Guide for Women is the ideal training manual for women who don't believe that running is their biological destiny but who dream of crossing the finish line nonetheless. Nonrunners offers a realistic training schedule and is chock-full of how-to's and funny observations, which she felt were lacking in the guides she had consulted. She also integrates entries from her journal, sharing everything would-be marathoners need to know about the gear, the blisters, the early morning workouts, the late-night carb binges, and most important of all, the amazing rewards. Running may not seem like a friendly endeavor, but with Dawn Dais, you can tame the beast and hit the marathon trail.",

Aubrey, now a considerable though impoverished landowner, has dimmed his prospects at the Admiralty by his erratic voting as a Member of Parliament; he is feuding with his neighbor, a man with strong Navy connections who wants to enclose the common land between their estates; he is on even worse terms with his wife, Sophie, whose mother has ferreted out a most damaging trove of old personal letters. Even Jack's exploits at sea turn sour: in the storm waters off Brest he captures a French privateer laden with gold and ivory, but this at the expense of missing a signal and deserting his post. Worst of all, in the spring of 1814, peace breaks out, and this feeds into Jack's private fears for his career.Fortunately, Jack is not left to his own devices. Stephen Maturin returns from a mission in France with the news that the Chileans, to secure their independence, require a navy, and the service of English officers. Jack is savoring this apparent reprieve for his career, as well as Sophie's forgiveness, when he receives an urgent dispatch ordering him to Gibraltar: Napoleon has escaped from Elba.",
