Failing that, run off with your ex-boyfriend, carry suspicious packages through customs, and lie to the person who loves you. . . .Georgie Beauchamp is totally happy and in love with her wonderful, dependable boyfriend, David. So why does she always daydream about running into her gorgeous ex-boyfriend Mike? It can\u2019t mean she\u2019s still in love with him\u2014especially since the cad dumped her so horribly. As luck would have it, when Georgie\u2019s daydream actually comes true, she is dressed in unglamorous sweats and carrying a curtain rod down the street, while Mike is driving an expensive sports car and looking better than Brad Pitt at the Oscars. She longs to have the glamorous life Mike can offer\u2014and starts to think that he might want her back in his arms.But when he invites her for a weekend in Rome, Georgie is torn. David has always said he\u2019d take her there for the romantic getaway of a lifetime, but his work keeps him totally tied up. So she must choose: David, all comfort and reliability, or Mike, all flirtation and butterfly-stomachs. The decision isn\u2019t too hard to make, and faster than she can say Vespa, she\u2019s off to Rome with Mike, full of plans to frolic on the Spanish Steps and sip wine in intimate trattorias. But when David shows up unexpectedly, this roman holiday gets a hell of a lot more complicated. . . .",

In The Hunt Ball, the latest novel in this popular series, all the ingredients Brown\u2019s readers love are abundantly present: richness of character and landscape, the thrill of the hunt, and the chill of violence.The trouble begins at Custis Hall, an exclusive girls\u2019 school in Virginia that has gloried in its good name for nearly two hundred years. At first, the outcry is a mere tempest in a silver teapot\u2013a small group of students protesting the school\u2019s exhibit of antique household objects crafted by slaves\u2013and headmistress Charlotte Norton quells the ruckus easily. But when one of the two hanging corpses ornamenting the students\u2019 Halloween dance turns out to be real\u2013the body of the school\u2019s talented fund-raiser, in fact\u2013Charlotte and the entire community are stunned. Everyone liked Al Perez, or so it seemed, yet his murder was particularly unpleasant. Even \u201cSister\u201d Jane Arnold, master of the Jefferson Hunt Club, beloved by man and beast, is at a loss, although she knows better than anyone where the bodies are buried in this community of land-grant families and new-money settlers. Aided and abetted by foxes and owls, cats and hounds, Sister picks up a scent that leads her in a most unwelcome direction: straight to the heart of the foxhunting crowd. The chase is on, not only for foxes but also for a deadly human predator.No one has created a fictional paradise more delightful than the rolling hills of Rita Mae Brown\u2019s Virginia countryside, or has more charmingly captured the rituals of the hunt. No one understands human and animal nature more deeply. The Hunt Ball combines a rounded, welcoming world with an edge of unforgettable white-knuckled menace.",

They\u2019ve gained new perspectives on the trials and temptations they face, new tools to help them survive automatic human responses to challenging situations, and new actions which produce humility and flexibility in God\u2019s strength. You can be a man of integrity too.Confession breaks the power of temptation in men of integrity; connection with other men sustains the victory. Being God\u2019s Man\u2026in the Face of Temptation will help you\u2013whether in individual or group study\u2013confront this pervasive problem in God\u2019s wisdom and strength. And begin to live the undivided life.",

Naipaul gives us a tale as wholly un-expected as it is affecting, his first novel since the exultantly acclaimed A Way in the World, published seven years ago.Half a Life is the story of Willie Chandran, whose father, heeding the call of Mahatma Gandhi, turned his back on his brahmin heritage and married a woman of low caste\u2014a disastrous union he would live to regret, as he would the children that issued from it. When Willie reaches manhood, his flight from the travails of his mixed birth takes him from India to London, where, in the shabby haunts of immigrants and literary bohemians of the 1950s, he contrives a new identity. This is what happens as he tries to defeat self-doubt in sexual adventures and in the struggle to become a writer\u2014strivings that bring him to the brink of exhaustion, from which he is rescued, to his amazement, only by the love of a good woman. And this is what happens when he returns with her\u2014carried along, really\u2014to her home in Africa, to live, until the last doomed days of colonialism, yet another life not his own.In a luminous narrative that takes us across three continents, Naipaul explores his great theme of inheritance with an intimacy and directness unsurpassed in his extraordinary body of work. And even as he lays bare the bitter comical ironies of assumed identities, he gives us a poignant spectacle of the enervation peculiar to a borrowed life. In one man\u2019s determined refusal of what he has been given to be, Naipaul reveals the way of all our experience. As Willie comes to see, \u201cEverything goes on a bias. The world should stop, but it goes on.\u201d A masterpiece of economy and emotional nuance, Half a Life is an indelible feat of the imagination.",

But years of failure and bad choices created a heartbreaking distance that has grown far worse since the day Josh was hit by a drunk driver. Now on medical disability, Josh has put his life on hold for years, waiting for the insurance company to send a settlement that never seems to come. Worse, he believes the story of a scheming woman who claims they have a seven-year-old daughter named Savannah.  Despite the unlikelihood and complete lack of evidence, Josh dreams of being a father and is determined to one day claim the child. His family doesn't know the full story. They don't know what happened the night of the accident that was worth the chronic pain Josh suffers every waking minute, or that he is turning his life around. They haven't seen that Savannah's eyes are his, and they don't know how desperately the little girl needs her family.  When the settlement that rightly belongs to Josh is threatened, Annie sets out to defend her son. But she might find a treasure more valuable than money, one she never expected, one that is the greatest gift her son could ever give her--THIS SIDE OF HEAVEN.",

Intelligence has been largely ignored, not because it wasn't critically important - Lincoln called it the most difficult problem faced by the Union - but because so little has been known about it. At the end of the war most of the intelligence records disappeared, and they remained hidden for almost a century, until Edwin Fishel uncovered them during the forty years of research that has resulted in this monumental book. The Secret War for the Union is unique among Civil War histories in its reliance on original, previously unknown sources. It is the first book to examine in detail the impact of intelligence, and this intelligence explanation alters, sometimes radically, history's understanding of virtually every campaign. Both enthralling and authoritative, The Secret War for the Union is one of the most important books ever published about the Civil War.",

        "Description": "There's no escaping the ACT. Many colleges require that you suffer through the ordeal of taking this entrance exam before they will even look at your application. Some colleges emphasize ACT scores to compensate for grade inflation; that is, some high schools may give students A's for doing the same level work that would gain them C's in other high schools. Because the ACT is the same for everyone (students nationwide take the exact same exam), colleges use ACT scores to get inside your head to see what's really in there. Think of this as an opportunity, not a crisis \u2013 after all, good ACT scores can overcome low GPAs.No matter how good your high school teachers are, their main goal is to prepare you for the real world \u2013 and not the world of the ACT. That's where The ACT For Dummies, 3rd Edition, takes over. Newly revised for the latest version of the exam, this book takes a substantive, but easy-to-understand, approach to helping you prepare for the exam, while at the same time presenting its information in the typical Dummies style \u2013 with humor and fun. If anything can make preparing for the ACT enjoyable, this book can.Here's a sampling of what you'll find in The ACT For Dummies, 3rd Edition:An overview of the test: Understanding the format and how the scoring worksStress-busters: How to survive exam dayThings to double-check and things to avoid while taking the testReviews of grammar and spelling, algebra and geometry, reading, and science reasoningPlenty of practice questions for all parts of the testThree full-length ACT practice tests (no, not the real thing!)Top Ten lists debunking ACT rumors, differences between the ACT and SAT, and true ACT storiesYou know you have to take the ACT seriously; after all, it can determine the college you go to, which will, in turn, affect the rest of your life. (Talk about pressure!) So why not be prepared? With The ACT For Dummies, 3rd Edition, you'll be as prepared for the exam as anyone can be, and you may just have a little fun in the process.",

Darby Conley's first book, This Dog Is Not a Toy, sold more than 115,000 copies; his second book, Fuzzy Logic, more than 85,000.When he was a child, Darby Conley used to wonder what his beloved pooch was thinking.

Showcasing the relationship between Bucky, a temperamental cat with an attitude; the sweet and sensitive dog Satchel; and their mild-mannered human companion, Rob Wilco, Get Fuzzy has cornered the market on anthropomorphic antics.Anyone who finds animals both amazing and amusing will find this new Get Fuzzy collection one of the most bitingly funny books ever printed.",

With warmth and wit, Steinbach guides us through the pleasures and perils of discovering how to be a student again.
