        "Description": "A chance to be a part of a headline-grabbing case against a drug company has lured attorney Avery Andrews back to Charleston, South Carolina. She agrees to meet with Mark Tilman, a young doctor from her hometown who seems to have something on his mind. When he doesn\u2019t show, she figures he stood her up and takes comfort in the stilt restaurant\u2019s she-crab soup. But it turns out he had a fatal car accident. Something about the crash isn\u2019t right, and Mark\u2019s father asks Avery to look into his death. Between that and digging up dirt on the wonder drug Uplift, Avery is coming up with more questions than answers.\u00a0Of course, Avery isn\u2019t the only one making headlines. Back in Dacus, her mom is on live television confronting a teenager\u2019s dynamite-toting paramour in a hostage crisis at the Burger Hut, Great-Aunt Aletha is mixing it up with the now-toupeeless postman, and the son of a ghost wants vengeance. In short, it\u2019s life as usual back in Dacus, while in Charleston, Avery is forced to face demons from her past. \u00a0Cathy Pickens\u2019s first mystery novel established her as a distinctive voice in the cozy tradition. In this second, readers can expect more Southern wit and charm, more courtroom drama, and even crazier antics from the folks back home, all the while falling more and more in love with this endearing heroine.",

After her mother\u2019s death, she quits her teaching job and descends upon her poor but aristocratic relatives, the Count and Countess Casati, in Assisi. It takes a while before they realize, to their chagrin, that Rita has come to stay. When the family assembles to watch the penitentes procession in the town square during Easter Week, a Casati tradition, Rita does not join them as planned. Her corpse is later found in the family mausoleum.  Alessandro Cenni, a commissario in the State Police of Umbria, and a handsome bachelor whose twin brother is about to become a bishop, must penetrate the secrets of the Casati family and their circle if he is to discover who killed Rita and why. But he is blocked by their powerful right-wing connections, and by a superior who prefers to arrest a scapegoat rather than risk political suicide. Aided by a loyal staff in his quest for that rarity\u2014justice\u2014he still must acknowledge that no one can defeat the last enemy, death itself.   Grace Brophy grew up in Queens, New York. She now divides her time between New York and Terni, a village in Umbria, where she lives with her husband, a Uruguayan artist. This is the first in the Commissario Cenni series of investigations set in Italy.",

They know with conviction what they believe within themselves. They understand that all actions have consequences. And they find commonsense solutions to the nation\u2019s problems.  One such American, Thomas Paine, was an ordinary man who changed the course of history by penning Common Sense, the concise 1776 masterpiece in which, through extraordinarily straightforward and indisputable arguments, he encouraged his fellow citizens to take control of America\u2019s future\u2014and, ultimately, her freedom.  Nearly two and a half centuries later, those very freedoms once again hang in the balance. And now, Glenn Beck revisits Paine\u2019s powerful treatise with one purpose: to galvanize Americans to see past government\u2019s easy solutions, two-party monopoly, and illogical methods and take back our great country.",

The wit, acuity, and sheer delight these writers take in slaughtering sacred cows make this collection so appealing that even liberals may find it irresistible.Among the selections: Mark Helprin, admitting (to a class of West Point graduates) that what he did during the war in Vietnam was draft-dodging and wrong; Danielle Crittenden, with a manifesto for unnatural (or, at least, drug-assisted) childbirth; Andrew Ferguson, lampooning the movement to create sensitive men; Joe Queenan, intrepidly pushing the envelope of New York City's anti-smoking laws; and Florence King, on the elitist art of insulting.All this plus contributions by George Gilder, Charles Murray, James Q.

He has produced two gorgeous colour pictures of each cat in its typical habitat. These are accompanied by a pen portrait documenting the cat&apos;s life in the cathedral and its particular foibles and eccentricities.  The book is full of humour and insight into the twilight world of the cat.  Biggles, feline tyrant of Westminster Abbey, was born in a mining village and now hunts rats and other cats in the ancient cloisters. His daily promenade takes him right down the centre aisle of the Abbey, and he has been seen both asleep and sharpening his claws on the high altar. He hides in a dense Virginia creeper and surprises passers by, notably dogs and Japanese tourists. He was issued with an official warning by the Westminster police after he mauled a constable&apos;s trousers. Such is the stuff of Cathedral Cats.",

        "Description": "Lend Me Your Ears collects, in one immensely rich compendium, some two hundred of history's outstanding instances of oratorical eloquence. They are selected, arranged, and introduced by William Safire, one of America's most influential political columnists, himself a former speechwriter and language scholar. From Demosthenes mounting an angry defense against his attackers in one of his immortal philippics, to Abraham Lincoln consecrating the memory of the Union dead at Gettysburg, to Winston Churchill rallying a beleaguered Britain with a promise of \"blood, toil, sweat and tears,\" to Salman Rushdie unexpectedly electrifying an audience with his paean to the necessity of free speech - this anthology contains the finest examples of the art of speechmaking in human experience.The book is arranged by theme and occasion: Memorials and Patriotic Speeches, War and Revolution Speeches, Tributes and Eulogies, Debates and Argumentation, Trial Speeches, Gallows and Farewell Speeches, Sermons, Inspirational Speeches, Lectures and Instructive Speeches, Speeches of Social Responsibility, Media Speeches, Political Speeches (in Safire's words, \"the anthologist's mother's milk\"), and Commencement Addresses. Each speech is expertly introduced by the editor, who places the speech's occasion in historical context and analyzes the particular techniques that give the speech its force and effect. William Safire enlivens many of these introductions with personal anecdotes of the circumstances of the speechmaker and the speech. His Introduction is a brisk, compact, effective short course in how to make a great speech - with a cornucopia of examples to follow.No one faced with the need to go before an audience of any size to argue, persuade, uplift, introduce, memorialize, or amuse should be without Lend Me Your Ears. It serves equally as a work of permanent reference use and as a treasure-house for the browser in search of inspiration, instruction, and entertainment. In this anthology, editor and subject matter have met to result in a book that draws from the ages - and that will last for decades as the definitive word on human eloquence.",

        "Description": "In response to current events, Charles Tripp has updated his incisive book A History of Iraq to include developments as recent as mid-2002. Since its establishment by the British in the 1920s, Iraq has witnessed the rise and fall of successive authoritarian regimes, competing ruthlessly for power and resources. This struggle culminated in the dictatorship of Saddam Husain, who still maintains his grip over a fragmented and increasingly isolated society. Tripp's book traces Iraq's political history from its nineteenth-century roots in the Ottoman empire, to the development of the state, its transformation from monarchy to republic and the rise of the Ba'th party and the ascendancy and current rule of Saddam Husain.     This is a story of social conflict, of power struggles between rival clans, of hostility and wars with neighboring states, as well as of their aftermath, and Iraq's deteriorating relations with the West.  A History of Iraq offers incisive analysis of the making of a modern state and how it creates its own distinctive politics.   Charles Tripp is Senior Lecturer in the Department of Political Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.  He is the co-author of Iran-Saudi Arabia Relations and Regional Order (Oxford, 1997) and Iran and Iraq at War (Westview, 1998).",

K. C. Cole's \"Fun with Physics\" is a profile of astrophysicist Janet Conrad that blends her personal life with professional activity. In \"Desperate Measures,\" the doctor and writer Atul Gawande profiles the surgeon Francis Daniels Moore, whose experiments in the 1940s and '50s pushed medicine harder and farther than almost anyone had contemplated. Also included is a poem by the legendary John Updike, \"Mars as Bright as Venus.\" The collection ends with Diane Ackerman's \"ebullient\" essay \"We Are All a Part of Nature.\"Together these twenty-three articles on a wide range of today's most current topics in science -- from biology, physics, biotechnology, and astronomy, to anthropology, genetics, evolutionary theory, and cognition\u201a represent the full spectrum of scientific writing from America's most prominent science authors, proving once again that \"good science writing is evidently plentiful\" (Scientific American).",
