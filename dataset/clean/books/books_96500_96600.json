        "Authors": "By Schell, Orville (EDT), Spiegel, Mickey (EDT), Sperling, Elliot (EDT), Aaronson, Jeffrey (EDT), and Marshall, Steven D. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Through a diverse selection of photographs, personal interviews, and historical information, Tibet Since 1950:  Silence, Prison, or Exile, a collaboration between Aperture and Human Rights Watch, looks beyond the Shangri-la image of Tibet to the impact of political repression by the Chinese government on Tibetan lives.The Tibet Autonomous Region as well as the area known as \"eastern Tibet,\" has been shaped by fifty years of direct Chinese government control. The impact of that control is evident in Tibetan culture, politics, economic activity, and religious practice. It is manifest in the extensive prison network used to detain those perceived as challenging Chinese rule and in the extreme measures used to keep protests in check. This publication contains rare photographs of Chinese government crackdowns on Tibetan demonstrations and riveting first-hand accounts from Tibetans living in exile. It examines the physical damange inflicted upon Tibetan religious institutions in the past and the more subtle destruction still going on today.Tibet Since 1950 offers a new perspective on the complicated subject of recent Tibetan history, avoiding the standard clich\u00e9s of Tibet as a land defined by the search for spiritual enlightenment and as an exotic paradise. The real Tibet is far more complex. This book examines the bleak banality of repressive control that is as much a part of Tibet as is its scenic beauty.The richly varied photographs are accompanied by an introduction by Tibet expert Elliot Sperling; accounts by Mickey Spiegel of Human Rights Watch with Tibetans who were detained in prison and are now living in exile; a discussion of Tibetan prisons by Steven Marshall; and a consideration of Tibet, myth and reality, by Orville Schell.Photographers include:  Jeffrey Aaronson, John Ackerly, Diane Barker, Kevin Bubriski, Kathryn Culley, Ian Cumming, Carl de Keyzer, Raphaele Demandre, Guy Dinmore, Stuart Franklin, Richard Gere, Alberto Giuliani, Catherine Henriette, Lynn Johnson, Russell Johnson, Steven Marshall, Marcos Prado, Matthieu Ricard, Galen Rowell, Michael Springer, and Franz Stich.",

In 2008, the president of the United Nations General Assembly convened an international panel, chaired by Nobel Prize&#150;winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and including twenty leading international experts on the international monetary system, to address this crucial issue.The Stiglitz Report, released by the committee in late 2009, sees the recent financial crisis as the latest and most damaging of several concurrent crises&#151;of food, water, energy, and sustainability&#151;that are tightly interrelated. The analysis and recommendations in the report cover the gamut from short-term mitigation to deep structural changes, from crisis response to reform of the global, economic, and financial architecture.The report establishes a bold agenda for policy change, that is sure to be the gold standard for understanding and contending with the international economy for many years to come. The Stiglitz Report is essential reading for anyone concerned about a secure and prosperous world.",

        "Description": "Windows XP is the latest, most reliable, and best-looking version of the world's most widely used operating system, combining the extremely stable engine of Windows NT and 2000 with the user-friendliness of the Windows 98 and Me consumer models. In its first year, XP became the fastest-selling Windows OS ever. But one major failing remains unaddressed: XP Pro comes without a single page of printed instructions.This superbly written guide fills the gap. Coauthored by David Pogue, New York Times technology columnist and Missing Manuals creator, Windows XP Pro: The Missing Manual uses wit, technical insight, and scrupulous objectivity to light the way for first-time and intermediate PC fans. The book reveals which features work well and which don't, such as the Remote Desktop software that enables people to connect to the office from home, the encryption file system that protects sensitive information, and the Windows Messenger that enables real-time text, voice and video communication. Contents include:Getting started. The book's early chapters cover using menus, finding lost files, reducing window clutter, and taming the new, multi-column Start menu.Mastering the network. Special chapters help you navigate the corporate network, dial in from the road, and even set up your own small-office (peer-to-peer) network, step by step.Understanding security. User accounts, file encryption, and the NTFS file system keep your private files private, while still offering network access to coworkers you specify.Flying the Net. This book demystifies Outlook Express 6 for email, Internet Explorer 6 for Web browsing, and the new Windows Messenger for voice, chat, and video conferencing.Windows XP Pro: The Missing Manual isn't for system administrators or OS theory geeks; it's for the novice or budding power user who wants to master the machine and get down to work. Yet, anyone who uses XP Pro (including hardcore techies) will find this new system much easier -- and more fun -- to digest with this new Missing Manual. This is the crystal-clear, jargon-free book that should have been in the box.",

        "Authors": "By Baker, Tiffany",
        "Description": "When Truly Plaice's mother was pregnant, the town of Aberdeen joined together in betting how recordbreakingly huge the baby boy would ultimately be.  The girl who proved to be Truly paid the price of her enormity; her father blamed her for her mother's death in childbirth, and was totally ill equipped to raise either this giant child or her polar opposite sister Serena Jane, the epitome of femine perfection. When he, too, relinquished his increasingly tenuous grip on life, Truly and Serena Jane are separated--Serena Jane to live a life of privilege as the future May Queen and Truly to live on the outskirts of town on the farm of the town sadsack, the subject of constant abuse and humiliation at the hands of her peers.Serena Jane's beauty proves to be her greatest blessing and her biggest curse, for it makes her the obsession of classmate Bob Bob Morgan, the youngest in a line of Robert Morgans who have been doctors in Aberdeen for generations. Though they have long been the pillars of the community, the earliest Robert Morgan married the town witch, Tabitha Dyerson, and the location of her fabled shadow book--containing mysterious secrets for healing and darker powers--has been the subject of town gossip ever since. Bob Bob Morgan, one of Truly's biggest tormentors, does the unthinkable to claim the prize of Serena Jane, and changes the destiny of all Aberdeen from there on.  When Serena Jane flees town and a loveless marriage to Bob Bob, it is Truly who must become the woman of a house that she did not choose and mother to her eight-year-old nephew Bobbie. Truly's brother-in-law is relentless and brutal; he criticizes her physique and the limitations of her health as a result, and degrades her more than any one human could bear. It is only when Truly finds her calling--the ability to heal illness with herbs and naturopathic techniques--hidden within the folds of Robert Morgan's family quilt, that she begins to regain control over her life and herself. Unearthed family secrets, however, will lead to the kind of betrayal that eventually break the Morgan family apart forever, but Truly's reckoning with her own demons allows for both an uprooting of Aberdeen County, and the possibility of love in unexpected places.",

        "Authors": "By Lee, Thomas H. and Mongan, James J.",
        "Description": "Two leading physicians' prescription for solving our health care problems: organizing the fragmented system that delivers care.One of the most daunting challenges facing the new U.S. administration is health care reform. The size of the system, the number of stakeholders, and ever-rising costs make the problem seem almost intractable. But in Chaos and Organization in Health Care, two leading physicians offer an optimistic prognosis. In their frontline work as providers, Thomas Lee and James Mongan see the inefficiency, the missed opportunities, and the occasional harm that can result from the current system. The root cause of these problems, they argue, is chaos in the delivery of care. If the problem is chaos, the solution is organization, and in this timely and outspoken book, they offer a plan.In many ways, this chaos is caused by something good: the dramatic progress in medical science\u2014the explosion of medical knowledge and the exponential increase in treatment options. Imposed on a fragmented system of small practices and individual patients with multiple providers, progress results in chaos. Lee and Mongan argue that attacking this chaos is even more important than whether health care is managed by government or controlled by market forces. Some providers are already tightly organized, adapting management principles from business and offering care that is by many measures safer, better, and less costly. Lee and Mongan propose multiple strategies that can be adopted nationwide, including electronic medical records and information systems for sharing knowledge; team-based care, with doctors and other providers working together; and disease management programs to coordinate care for the sickest patients.",

        "Description": "For the first time, in one volume of provocative essays, women speak out about their experiences with the American health-care system. From victims to victors, their reflections in Misdiagnosis: Woman As A Disease serve as an inspirational clarion call to all women who have been on the short end of American medicine. It is also a wake-up call to providers and institutions of medicine who, for more than a century, have treated women with arrogance and disrespect.Not since Our Bodies, Ourselves has a book about women's health been so powerful. Never before has any publication explored so many diverse and pertinent themes - all through the eyes, and in the words, of women.Sometimes poignant but always provocative, Misdiagnosis: Woman As A Disease is a collection of essays and short works on the most important topics related to the woman's health experience. Women voice their reactions to the medicalization of childbirth, the \"reshaping\" of women by plastic surgery, the obvious flaws in physician training that lead to indifference and trivialization of women's health concerns ... and so much more.In his preface to Misdiagnosis: Woman As A Disease, People's Medical Society President Charles B. Inlander indicts the medical system for decades of medical scandals perpetrated on women: DES, thalidomide, the Dalkon Shield, unnecessary hysterectomies, the sky-high cesarean section rate, silicone breast implants - all resulting in a long trail of victims.\"American medicine,\" he charges, \"has made the word 'woman' a medical diagnosis.\"For decades women have written of their experiences in the health-care system. But never have their thoughts and ideas been collected in one volume. Misdiagnosis: Woman As A Disease is that volume.",

With good implementations in Internet Explorer 5.0 and Opera  3.6, and 100% support expected in Netscape's \"Mozilla\" browser,  signs are that CSS is rapidly becoming a useful, reliable, and  powerful tool for web authors.CSS is the W3C-approved method for enriching the visual  presentation of web pages. Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive  Guide offers a complete, detailed review of CSS1 and CSS  positioning, as well as an overview of CSS2. Each property is  explored in detail with a discussion of how each interacts with  other properties. There is also information on how to avoid common  mistakes in interpretation.This book is the first major title to cover CSS in a way that both acknowledges and describes current browser support, instead of simply describing the way things work in theory. It offers both web authors and scripters a comprehensive guide to using CSS effectively.Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide targets veteran web authors who have already invested thousands of hours in learning HTML and writing web pages and are wondering why they need to learn a brand new language of style. This book supplies those dubious but curious web authors with the information they need to easily implement CSS for their web site.This book also addresses an audience of novice web authors who are already straining to learn all of the tags and attributes of HTML and can benefit now from implementing CSS correctly instead of repeating the mistakes of the past.The author has extensive experience writing about pitfalls and interesting tricks in CSS. He is a member of the CSS&FP Working Group, coordinates the W3C's CSS1 Test Suite, remains active on CSS newsgroups, and edits Web Review's Style Sheets Reference Guide. He has built a widespread reputation as a CSS expert, particularly with regard to his understanding of the intricacies of browser support for CSS. He brings his knowledge and expertise to this book in the form of hints, workarounds, and many other tips for web authors.",

        "Authors": "By Callahan, John",
        "Description": "It's the day after the disputed 2000 presidential election, and political strategist Gabe Bontempo is feeling that familiar itch. From a semiretired state in the forests of the Northwest, he begins to look back on a lifetime of politics and his generation's hastened coming of age.This novel follows the lives of Bontempo and his friend Mick Whelan, a young idealist from Oregon. They first meet at the March on Washington in 1963, then continue to cross paths on the presidential campaign trail - Whelan stumping for Eugene McCarthy, Bontempo for Robert Kennedy.Whelan is a \"half brooder, half wild man\" with visions of a better America. Bontempo grows to love him like a brother, and when Whelan launches an underdog bid for Congress, their fates become intertwined. Together they weather decades of political upheaval, from the civil rights and Vietnam era into the 1990s, while facing personal crises of their own.Offering a fresh look at the ins and outs of Washington politics, the thrills and surprises of the campaign trail, and the ongoing complexities of war, A Man You Could Love is also a tribute to friendship and families - the ones you are born into and those you find along the way.",

        "Authors": "By Merkl, Peter H.",
        "Description": "This is an exploration, with hundreds of appropriate quotes from French, British, German, Italian, and other newspapers, on how differently European journalists interpreted our attempt to impeach and remove our twice-elected president. This is not an effort to defend President Clinton. Contrary to what our media told us, Europeans did not just snicker about our attitude to sex scandals\u2014they did little of that\u2014but they critically and knowledgeably examined our obvious abuses of American legal procedures and concepts (e.g. perjury) and relevant constitutional clauses. They saw this as a five-year vendetta culminating in a quasi-constitutional coup attempt, not just the pursuit of a scandal, and believed an important part of our media was involved in the \"vast rightwing conspiracy\" to overthrow Clinton. Finally, and again unlike our media, they thought that this action damaged our constitutional system and would have destroyed it had the coup succeeded.",

        "Description": "No foreign policy decision in recent history has had greater repercussions than President George W. Bush's decision to invade and occupy Iraq. It launched a new doctrine of preemptive war, mired the American military in an intractable armed conflict, disrupted world petroleum supplies, cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars, and damaged or ended the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans and Iraqis. Its impact on international politics and America's standing in the world remains incalculable.The Iraq Papers offers a compelling documentary narrative and interpretation of this momentous conflict. With keen editing and incisive commentary, the book weaves together original documents that range from presidential addresses to redacted memos, carrying us from the ideology behind the invasion to negotiations for withdrawal. These papers trace the rise of the neoconservatives and reveal the role of strategic thinking about oil supplies. In moving to the planning for the war itself, the authors not only provide Congressional resolutions and speeches by President Bush, but internal security papers, Pentagon planning documents, the report of the Future of Iraq Project, and eloquent opposition statements by Senator Robert Byrd, other world governments, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the World Council of Churches. This collection addresses every aspect of the conflict, from the military's evolving counterinsurgency strategy to declarations by Iraqi resisters and political figures-from Coalition Provisional Authority orders to Donald Rumsfeld's dismissal of the insurgents as \"dead-enders\" and Iraqi discussions of state- and nationbuilding under the shadow of occupation. The economics of petroleum, the legal and ethical questions surrounding terrorism and torture, international agreements, the theory of the \"unitary presidency,\" and the Bush administration's use of presidential signing statements all receive in-depth coverage.The Iraq War has reshaped the domestic and international landscape. The Iraq Papers offers the authoritative one-volume source for understanding the conflict and its many repercussions.",

Then her eyes sprang wide and her lips parted and she repeated over and over like a sinner's prayer how she would not sorry away like Marnie...-- From Like a Sister It is 1956 and Sister is only thirteen years old, but she is a mother to her two younger twin brothers and her toddler sister.  Her mother, Marnie, has had a string of boyfriends, and her latest is more interested in building up business at his new caf\u00e9 than he is in raising three children that are not his own.  Marnie is involved in the caf\u00e9 as well--but Sister is not exactly sure how.  All she knows is that Marnie isn't around very much.  Things weren't always this way--at one time they were close, \"just like sisters.\" Now it seems they are strangers, and Sister has noticed that the neighbors are giving each other looks--looks that say that whatever Marnie is up to at the caf\u00e9, it isn't respectable.  Deciding that she will not follow in Marnie's footsteps, Sister begins to take charge of her life, as best she can, by minding her manners, and by befriending her kindly next-door neighbor, Willa, who seems to Sister to be a fine example of how a mother should be.  But then Ray Williams, a respected and powerful man in town, begins to notice the blossoming Sister, and when he realizes that she has no adult supervision, he sets his sights on her.  Willa steps in to intervene, and Sister thinks she may have found salvation, but in Like a Sister, all is never what it seems. A haunting coming-of-age tale, Like a Sister will linger in the minds of readers long after the last page has been turned.",

        "Authors": "By Ehrbar, Al",
        "Description": "Called \"today's hottest financial idea and getting hotter\" by fortune magazine, Economic Value Added (EVA) is the topic of conversation in financial circles around the world, from Germany and Japan to Singapore and South Africa. A revolutionary strategy for creating corporate and shareholder wealth that measures a company's real profitability, it has been adopted by such prominent corporations as Coca-Cola, Eli Lilly, and Siemens AG-with spectacular financial results. Yet, despite its increasing visibility, most executives still only have a vague notion of what EVA is and what it can do for their company. This groundbreaking book explains and clarifies all. Written by Al Ehrbar, a leading business journalist and senior vice president at EVA inventor Stern Stewart & Co., EVA: The Real Key to Creating Wealth provides a complete, accessible overview that examines how exactly EVA works, how it is measured, what it can do to structure incentives for employees, and why it is as potent as it is.  At its most basic, Economic Value Added is a measure of corporate performance that differs from most others by charging profit for the cost of all the capital a company employs, including equity. To help translate principle into real-world practice, Ehrbar presents revealing case histories of EVA success stories, including those of Briggs & Stratton, the U.S. Postal Service, and Coca-Cola, which was catapulted from mediocrity to the number one wealth creator in the world with the addition of EVA.  An in-depth look at a breakthrough idea whose impact is being felt from corporate boardrooms to Wall Street, this indispensable book is must reading for business leaders looking to fully grasp-and profit from-\"the real key to creating wealth.\"",
