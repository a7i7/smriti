        "Description": "Four stories of comedy, deception, and revenge, including one previously unpublished, from the acclaimed author of Heir to the Glimmering World. Cynthia Ozick\u2019s new work of fiction brings together four long stories that showcase this incomparable writer\u2019s sly humor and piercing insight into the human heart. Each starts in the comic mode, with heroes who suffer from willful self-deceit. These not-so-innocents proceed from self-deception to deceiving others, who do not take it lightly. Revenge is the consequence -- and for the reader, a delicious, if dark, recognition of emotional truth. The glorious new novella \u201cDictation\u201d imagines a fateful meeting between the secretaries to Henry James and Joseph Conrad at the peak of their fame. Timid Miss Hallowes, who types for Conrad, comes under the influence of James\u2019s Miss Bosanquet, high-spirited, flirtatious, and scheming. In a masterstroke of genius, Ozick hatches a plot between them to insert themselves into posterity. Ozick is at her most devious, delightful best in these four works, illuminating the ease with which comedy can glide into calamity.",

The proud owner of a spanking-new medical degree and little else in the way of worldly possessions, Barry jumps at the chance to secure a position as an assistant in a small rural practice.At least until he meets Dr. Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly.The older physician, whose motto is to never let the patients get the upper hand, has his own way of doing things.

Through O'Reilly Barry soon gets to know all of the village's colorful and endearing residents, including:A malingering Major and his equally hypochondriacal wife;An unwed servant girl, who refuses to divulge the father of her upcoming baby;A slightly daft old couple unable to marry for lack of a roof;And a host of other eccentric characters who make every day an education for the inexperienced young doctor.Ballybucklebo is long way from Belfast, and Barry is quick to discover that he still has a lot to learn about the quirks and traditions of country life.

        "Title": "Shiksa Goddess: Or, How I Spent My Forties",
        "Authors": "By Wasserstein, Wendy",
        "Description": "1. Wasserstein says in the preface that most of these essays were written in response to a To Do list she\u2019d composed when she turned forty: \u201close weight, exercise, read more, improve female friendships, improve male friendships, become a better citizen . . . move, fall in love, and the enormous \u2018decide about baby\u2019\u201d (p. ix). In what ways do these goals reflect a midlife frame of mind? How well does Wasserstein succeed in accomplishing these goals? What examples of humor and self-irony does she find in her attempts complete her list? 2. The title of this book is Shiksa Goddess , and in the opening essay Wasserstein indirectly pokes fun at gentiles like Madeline Albright and Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2013both of whom publicly announced that they had Jewish ancestors\u2013by revealing her own \u201cEpiscopalian\u201d roots. In what ways does Wasserstein bring a distinctly Jewish perspective to her view of herself and the world around her? 3. What conclusions does Wasserstein draw from her experiment of taking eight high school students to see a variety of Broadway plays? How do the students respond to the plays? What do their responses suggest about both the strength of American theater and the problems it has in reaching a larger, more inclusive audience? 4. Wasserstein is a passionate advocate of funding the arts. In the essay \u201cThe State of the Arts,\u201d she writes, \u201cFor every congressman who would say that the arts are elitist, I would answer that museums, plays, and dance are not responsible for violence in elementary schools or the tragedy at Columbine High or the hopelessness felt by many adolescents\u201d [p. 153]. Is this an effective argument? What other reasons does she give for why the government should support the arts? What does she feel is the ultimate value of the arts for the individual and for the nation? What direction does she think future funding for the arts should take? 5. Why is Wasserstein so disappointed with Hillary Clinton? Are her criticisms just? How does her view of Hillary Clinton fit with the other statements she makes about women throughout the book? 6. Much of the charm of Wasserstein\u2019s essays comes from the persona she presents. In \u201cMaking Nice: When Is Enough Enough?\u201d she writes, \u201cWhatever nice means, I\u2019ve been it all my life\u201d [p.143]. How is this quality revealed in her writing? What other characteristics or personality traits of Wendy Wasserstein are on display in Shiksa Goddess ? How seriously does she take herself? 7. When Wasserstein visits her mother\u2019s Poland she is reminded of the terrible fate of Polish Jews in World War II. How does her own Jewish perspective help her understand what is happening in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina? In what ways does the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans parallel the Holocaust? Why does she feel it is so important to keep telling the stories of oppression and genocide? 8. Many of the essays in Shiksa Goddess are imbued with a deep admiration for the important people in Wasserstein\u2019s life, from her sister and her mother to the 101-year-old director George Abbott and the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov. What does Wasserstein admire about Chekhov\u2019s plays and Abbott\u2019s direction? How have these two figures influenced her work? 9. In \u201cWaif Goodbye, Hello Bulge\u201d and \u201cNew York Theater: Isn\u2019t It Romantic,\u201d Wasserstein challenges prevailing views about the attractiveness of women\u2019s bodies and the vitality of contemporary theater, suggesting that super-thin supermodels are now trying to gain weight in order to be fashionable and that actors are now spurning Hollywood movies for the New York stage. What point is she making in these satirical essays? Why is this a more effective way of revealing society\u2019s foolishness than a more straightforward criticism would be? 10. In \u201cThree Sisters,\u201d after Wasserstein has just watched her play The Sisters Rosensweig , she thinks to herself that \u201cthis author must be very mature. She must believe in family and personal history. She must believe in the challenge and tradition of well-structured plays. . . . She must believe there are possibilities. Obviously, then, the author could not possibly be me\u201d [p. 67]. Why would Wasserstein view herself in this way? Where else in Shiksa Goddess does this self-deprecating humor occur? In what ways do these essays in fact demonstrate a strong belief in family and personal history? 11. Wasserstein observes, \u201cChekhov got to do it all. He was funny, he was sad. He was moving, he was satirical\u201d [p. 183]. Where does this mixture of humor, satire, sadness, and poignancy appear in Wasserstein\u2019s own writing? How does humor help her to deal with her sister\u2019s illness and death, and with all the painful, nerve-wracking uncertainties surrounding her daughter\u2019s birth? 12. In \u201cJill\u2019s Adventures in Real Estate,\u201d a one-act about an aspiring writer searching for affordable housing in Manhattan, the interior designer Bario Baronial complains, \u201cThe thing about these Park Avenue apartments is they\u2019re all really too small. That\u2019s why the Carnegies, the Vanderbilts, and the Warburgs all built houses. The problem is they\u2019re all museums now, and it\u2019s very hard to get Landmarks Preservation to permit you to turn a museum into a private home\u201d [p. 109]. What is Wasserstein suggesting here about the relationship between art and money, or between artists and real estate agents, in New York? What makes her satire of the way artists are treated in New York so biting and so effective? 13. In discussing her sister\u2019s career, Wasserstein writes, \u201cMy sister would say that life takes its toll, male or female, period. I heartily disagree. I can\u2019t help but wonder what difference it would have made in my sister\u2019s personal or corporate life if she had been a man. Of course, Sandra would say that if you\u2019re a player, gender shouldn\u2019t be an issue. But for my generation, gender is the issue\u201d [p. 82]. Based on these essays and on her plays, how does Wasserstein view the unique problems and possibilities women face in contemporary America? 14. Wasserstein often mentions or quotes her mother, Lola, in these essays. What kind of woman is she? How has she influenced Wasserstein\u2019s life? 15. While many of the essays in Shiksa Goddess are quick and lighthearted, the final two, \u201cHow I Spent My Forties\u201d and \u201cDays of Awe: The Birth of Lucy Jane\u201d are longer and deal with the much weightier subjects of her sister\u2019s terminal illness and the turmoil of her daughter\u2019s premature birth. Why would Wasserstein choose to end her book with these essays? What makes them so powerful and moving? In what ways does Wasserstein\u2019s skill as a playwright allow her to convey all the tension and drama of",

        "Title": "Prodigal Soldiers: How the Generation of Officers Born of Vietnam Revolutionized the American Style of War (An AUSA Institute of Land Warfare book)",
        "Authors": "By Kitfield, James",
        "Description": "The unprecedented display of prowess and efficiency in Desert Storm revealed a military unlike any the nation had ever seen before. From the disarray in the aftermath of Vietnam to the \"Be All That You Can Be\" campaign in the 1980s, the U.S. armed services did no less than reinvent themselves, with stunning results. In Prodigal Soldiers, James Kitfield chronicles that remarkable revitalization of the military by following the lives of a unique generation of officers, the senior commanders who led the nation to victory in Desert Storm.There is Colin Powell, the nation's youngest and first African-American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose epiphany on leadership came not in Washington, D.C., but in the 1970s as a young commander in South Korea in the midst of anarchy; Chuck Horner, the irreverent combat pilot who watched the Air Force fall into the habit of lying to itself in Vietnam, and who was seemingly at the end of his career before being called on to lead the air war; Barry McCaffrey, the infantryman wounded three times and nearly killed in Vietnam, who went on to become Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf's most aggressive division commander and the most highly decorated general in uniform; Adm. Stan Arthur, the decorated naval aviator who had to temper the Navy's fierce streak of independence to fight a joint-service war; and Walt Boomer, the laconic Marine commander from Tennessee whose own experience as a grunt in Vietnam helped him to face an agonizing decision that seemed to pit the good of his beloved Corps against the lives of his young Marines.In a tightly woven narrative tracing the lives of these officers through three decades, Kitfield reveals how their experiences as young men in Vietnam changed forever their ideas about how wars should be fought and what is worth dying for. In the dark aftermath of Vietnam marked by racial tension, drug abuse, and insubordination, each of the services confronted a demoralization within the ranks that threatened far more than the outcome of a single war. Significant social upheavals, including the end of the draft and an increased reliance on the reserves, and integration of women into the ranks, also pulled the military into new and uncertain directions in the 1970s.Tactics and training were revised as military leaders abandoned the old warfighting model of wearing an enemy down with industrial might in favor of a hotly debated strategy of gaining technological superiority and limiting casualties. Visionary mavericks in uniform provoked Congress to enact the most sweeping reorganization of military command structure in forty years, heralding an era of joint operations that drew synergy from the armed services.Prodigal Soldiers is the stirring tale of the American military's renewal and redemption.",

He has taken readers from the underbelly of New Orleans to the jungles of Vietnam, from the brutality of war-torn Central America to the sinister glamour of Hollywood. It has been nearly five years since the publication of his best-selling novel Outerbridge Reach, a work distinguished for its integrity and vision. The stories collected in Bear and His Daughter span nearly thirty years. Written between 1969 and the present, they explore, as powerfully and acutely as his novels, our common troubled condition and the humanity that unites us.

When sixteen-year-old Nouf goes missing, along with a truck and her favorite camel, her prominent family calls on Nayir al-Sharqi, a desert guide, to lead a search party. Ten days later, just as Nayir is about to give up in frustration, her body is discovered by anonymous desert travelers. But when the coroner\u2019s office determines that Nouf died not of dehydration but from drowning, and her family seems suspiciously uninterested in getting at the truth, Nayir takes it upon himself to find out what really happened to her. This mission will push gentle, hulking, pious Nayir, a Palestinian orphan raised by his bachelor uncle, to delve into the secret life of a rich, protected teenage girl\u2014in one of the most rigidly gender-segregated of Middle Eastern societies. Initially horrified at the idea of a woman bold enough to bare her face and to work in public, Nayir soon realizes that if he wants to gain access to the hidden world of women, he will have to join forces with Katya Hijazi, a lab worker at the coroner\u2019s office. Their partnership challenges Nayir, bringing him face to face with his desire for female companionship and the limitations imposed by his beliefs. It also ultimately leads them both to surprising revelations. Fast-paced and utterly transporting, Finding Nouf offers an intimate glimpse inside a closed society and a riveting literary mystery.",

Arnie and Jack.  Palmer and Nicklaus.  Their fifty-year duel, in both the clubhouse and the boardroom, propelled each to the status of American icon and pushed modern golf to the heights and popularity it enjoys today.Arnie was the cowboy, with rugged good looks, Popeye-like forearms, a flailing swing, and charm enough to win fans worldwide.  Jack was scientific, precise, conservative, aloof, even fat and awkward.  Ultimately, Nicklaus got the better of Palmer on the course, beating him in major victories 18-7.  But Palmer bested Nicklaus almost everywhere else, especially in the hearts of the public and in endorsement dollars.  By the end of this page-turning narrative, we see that each man wanted what the other had: Arnold wanted the trophies.  Jack wanted the love.In the tradition of John Feinstein and Mark Frost, Ian O\u2019Connor has written a compelling account of one of the greatest rivalries in sports history.",

He is serene and surrounded by lush scenes, depictions of this world as paradise. Yet once he appeared as crucified, dying was virtually all Jesus seemed able to do, and paradise disappeared from the earth. Saving Paradise turns a fascinating new lens on Christianity, from its first centuries to the present day, asking how its early vision of beauty evolved into a vision of torture, and what changes in society and theology marked that evolution. It also retrieves, for today, a life-affirming Christianity that the world sorely needs.",

        "Description": "As the cycle of change increases its speed, leadership communication is becoming more important than ever. Since the original publication of Leading Out Loud in 1995, the development of a leader's message has become as critical to success as the delivery of that message. In this new and revised edition of his highly praised work, Terry Pearce explains how the events of recent years, including the information revolution, worldwide focus on terrorism, and the revelation of corporate scandals, have significantly increased the importance of authenticity in leadership to build loyalty in organizations.This new edition focuses on the source of a message for change, its development as a platform for leadership communication, and its many forms of expression from speeches to e-mails, memos, and even informal \"water cooler\" conversation. Pearce shows leaders in business, politics, and nonprofits how to communicate their values and vision to inspire commitment; he provides tools and examples from well-known leaders as well as less-known but effective change agents. Leading Out Loud gives readers concrete methods for improving their own communication by guiding them to do the internal work necessary for creating an honest and compelling vision, and by demonstrating how readers can find their authentic voice and articulate their messages with confidence.People make commitments, says Pearce, to causes they value and to people they respect and trust. An authentic voice and an inclusive perspective are requisites for any leader who would inspire change. Trust is built by communicating from both the mind and the heart, speaking directly to the minds and hearts of others, listening to their response, and respecting their points of view. All leaders will benefit from Pearce's wisdom, as will anyone else who wants to inspire positive change through others.",

But Keisha and some of the villagers refuse to flee. As a Healer she knows she will be needed if there is bloodshed, and her Gift dictates that she stay, even if it puts her life in jeopardy. Yet how can one small band of Hawkbrothers and two Valdemaran teenagers with partially trained Gifts stand against the destructive might of a barbarian horde?",

        "Description": "The reigning master of grand historical fiction returns with the stirring conclusion to his bestselling Dublin Saga.\u00a0\u00a0The Princes of Ireland, the first volume of Edward Rutherfurd\u2019s magisterial epic of Irish history, ended with the disastrous Irish revolt of 1534 and the disappearance of the sacred Staff of Saint Patrick. The Rebels of Ireland opens with an Ireland transformed; plantation, the final step in the centuries-long English conquest of Ireland, is the order of the day, and the subjugation of the native Irish Catholic population has begun in earnest.   Edward Rutherfurd brings history to life through the tales of families whose fates rise and fall in each generation: Brothers who must choose between fidelity to their ancient faith or the security of their families; a wife whose passion for a charismatic Irish chieftain threatens her comfortable marriage to a prosperous merchant; a young scholar whose secret rebel sympathies are put to the test; men who risk their lives and their children\u2019s fortunes in the tragic pursuit of freedom, and those determined to root them out forever. Rutherfurd spins the saga of Ireland\u2019s 400-year path to independence in all its drama, tragedy, and glory through the stories of people from all strata of society--Protestant and Catholic, rich and poor, conniving and heroic.  \u00a0His richly detailed narrative brings to life watershed moments and events, from the time of plantation settlements to the \u201cFlight of the Earls,\u201d when the native aristocracy fled the island, to Cromwell\u2019s suppression of the population and the imposition of the harsh anti-Catholic penal laws. He describes the hardships of ordinary people and the romantic, doomed attempt to overthrow the Protestant oppressors, which ended in defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and the departure of the \u201cWild Geese.\u201d In vivid tones Rutherfurd re-creates Grattan\u2019s Parliament, Wolfe Tone's attempted French invasion of 1798, the tragic rising of Robert Emmet, the Catholic campaign of Daniel O\u2019Connell, the catastrophic famine, the mass migration to America, and the glorious Irish Renaissance of Yeats and Joyce. And through the eyes of his characters, he captures the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the great Irish nationalists and the birth of an Ireland free of all ties to England. \u00a0A tale of fierce battles, hot-blooded romances, and family and political intrigues, The Rebels of Ireland brings the story begun in The Princes of Ireland to a stunning conclusion.",

More than 300 new terms have been added, the same number from the first edition have been completely rewritten, and many of the others have also been revised.  As well as clear and concise definitions of all the terms commonly used in epidemiology, the dictionary provides definitions of terms from closely related fields.  Brief biographical sketches of historically important figures in epidemiology add to its value as a reference work.  The book's success is reflected in the number of foreign-language editions underway.  The first edition was translated into Japanese and Chinese. Spanish and Portuguese translations are in progress, and a French language version comparable to this second edition is in press.",

Intelligence gathering is an immensely complicated and vulnerable endeavor. And   it often fails. Until the invention of the telegraph and radio, information often   traveled no faster than a horse could ride, yet intelligence helped defeat Napoleon.   In the twentieth century, photo analysts didn\u2019t recognize Germany\u2019s V-2 rockets for   what they were; on the other hand, intelligence helped lead to victory over the Japanese   at Midway. In Intelligence in War, John Keegan illustrates that only when paired   with force has military intelligence been an effective tool, as it may one day be   in besting al-Qaeda.",
