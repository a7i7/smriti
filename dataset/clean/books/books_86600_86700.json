        "Description": "The highly-acclaimed Oxford Illustrated History of Britain tells the story of Britain and her peoples over two thousand years, from the coming of the Roman legions to the present day.  Now available in an easy-to-read, updated format, The Oxford History of Britain presents the text of this classic in British history.      Ten leading historians--including Peter Salway, John Blair, John Gillingham, Ralph A. Griffiths, John Guy, John S. Morrill, Paul Langford, Christopher Harvie, H.C.G. Matthew, and the editor himself, Kenneth O. Morgan--offer a dramatic narrative of developments throughout the British Isles, based on the fruits of the best modern scholarship. They explore the relationship between the political, economic, social, and cultural transformations in British history in order to reveal not only a vivid and sometimes surprising picture of continuous turmoil and change in every period, but also a pattern of continuity in British cultural and social ideals, as well as the special awareness of nationality and patriotism that characterizes British society.  Relating both these strands in the British experience and exploring the many ways in which Britain has shaped and been shaped by contact with Europe and the wider world, this comprehensive work brings the reader face to face with the past and the foundations of modern British society.      This voume updates the events in Kenneth O. Morgan's final chapter on the twentieth century as well as in the consolidated chronology.  Dr. John Guy has also revised his chapter on the Tudor age in light of exciting new developments in the research of the period.  The Oxford History of Britain contains 18 maps, genealogies of monarchs, a table of Prime Ministers, and an index, as well as an updated annotated guide to further reading.",

        "Description": "Congress empowered the Environmental Protection Agency on the theory that only a national agency that is insulated from accountability to voters could produce the scientifically grounded pollution rules needed to save a careless public from its own filth. In this provocative book, David Schoenbrod explains how his experience as an environmental advocate brought him to this startling realization: letting EPA dictate to the nation is a mistake.Through a series of gripping and illuminating anecdotes from his own career, the author reveals the EPA to be an agency that, under Democrats and Republicans alike, delays good rules, imposes bad ones, and is so big, muscle-bound, and remote that it does unnecessary damage to our society. EPA stays in power, he says, because it enables elected legislators to evade responsibility by hiding behind appointed bureaucrats. The best environmental rules?those that have done the most good?have come when Congress had to take responsibility or from states and localities rather than the EPA.With the passion of an authentic environmentalist, Schoenbrod makes a sensible plea for ?bottom-up\u201d environmental protection now. The responsibility for pollution control belongs not in agencies but in legislatures, and usually not at the federal level but rather closer to home.",

Maarten Troost has charmed legions of readers with his laugh-out-loud tales of wandering the remote islands of the South Pacific. When the travel bug hit again, he decided to go big-time, taking on the world\u2019s most populous and intriguing nation. In Lost on Planet China, Troost escorts readers on a rollicking journey through the new beating heart of the modern world, from the megalopolises of Beijing and Shanghai to the Gobi Desert and the hinterlands of Tibet. Lost on Planet China finds Troost dodging deadly drivers in Shanghai; eating Yak in Tibet; deciphering restaurant menus (offering local favorites such as Cattle Penis with Garlic); visiting with Chairman Mao (still dead, very orange); and hiking (with 80,000 other people) up Tai Shan, China\u2019s most revered mountain. But in addition to his trademark gonzo adventures, the book also delivers a telling look at a vast and complex country on the brink of transformation that will soon shape the way we all work, live, and think. As Troost shows, while we may be familiar with Yao Ming or dim sum or the cheap, plastic products that line the shelves of every store, the real China remains a world\u2014indeed, a planet--unto itself. Maarten Troost brings China to life as you\u2019ve never seen it before, and his insightful, rip-roaringly funny narrative proves that once again he is one of the most entertaining and insightful armchair travel companions around.",

In Fine Just the Way It Is, she has expanded the limits of the form. Her stories about multiple generations of Americans struggling through life in the West are a ferocious, dazzling panorama of American folly and fate.   \"Every ranch...had lost a boy,\" thinks Dakotah Hicks as she drives through \"the hammered red landscape\" of Wyoming, \"boys smiling, sure in their risks, healthy, tipped out of the current of life by liquor and acceleration, rodeo smashups, bad horses, deep irrigation ditches, high trestles, tractor rollovers and 'unloaded' guns. Her boy, too...The trip along this road was a roll call of grief.\"   Proulx's characters try to climb out of poverty and desperation but get cut down as if the land itself wanted their blood. Deeply sympathetic to the men and women fighting to survive in this harsh place, Proulx turns their lives into fiction with the power of myth -- and leaves the reader in awe.  The winner of two O. Henry Prizes, Annie Proulx has been anthologized in nearly every major collection of great American stories. Her bold, inimitable language, her exhilarating eye for detail and her dark sense of humor make this a profoundly compelling collection.",

        "Description": "\"This wonderful book illustrates precisely why we can never have enough Twain. His humor is timeless, his wisdom about all things without equal.\"--Ken Burns\"Mark Twain's Helpful Hints for Good Living is a real discovery as well as a delight. It brings us fresh material from an old friend, and rediscovers great moments from the long shelves of his published writings. It's the best, most reliable collection of Mark Twain as social observer, moralist, and comic genius.\"--Bruce Michelson, author of Mark Twain on the Loose and Literary Wit\"A delightful display of Mark Twain's wit and humor loosely tied together under the guise of an advice book. Containing some things old, some things new, some things borrowed (in parody), but nothing blue, this charming collection of old favorites and new releases will guide you through life's exigencies in fine spirits, if not in fine form. Twain's advice occasionally touches the sublime, but only in the form of the ridiculous. This is the perfect gift book for any aficionado of Mark Twain, any connoisseur of the risible, or any stuffed-shirt who needs to lighten up.\"--Gregg Camfield, author of The Oxford Companion to Mark Twain\"Twain came to understand himself as 'a moralist in disguise,' and this collection reveals that truth clearly, without jettisoning any of his humor. If you are wrestling with how to advance stimulating dinner conversation, what to do with unwanted magazine subscriptions, how to deal with the 'odious flummery' of fashion, or whether or not to bring your dog to the next funeral, Twain is here to offer his gentle guidance. Old chestnuts and surprising obscurities are provided in a refreshed context through the rich and illuminating annotations of the ever brilliant editorial team at the Mark Twain Papers.\"--John Boyer, executive director of The Mark Twain House and MuseumThis book serves up an elegant taste of Mark Twain's love for the food of the American South, spiced generously with his celebrated wit. Food lovers and humorists alike will revel in the timeless wisdom gathered here.--Nathalie Dupree, television host and author of Nathalie Dupree's Southern Memories\"This is a masterfully edited compendium that does Twain proud. It captures the note-taking, aphorism-creating, angry-letter-writing essence of Twain's brain in a way essential, I think, to understanding the man, and by extension, the history of the United States and the nature of life on Earth.\"--Dave Eggers, editor of McSweeney's",

But how many non-scholarly books have been written about giraffes-one of nature's most intriguing and unique animals? None. Until now.You know Lynn Sherr as a veteran journalist and as a leading correspondent for the ABC news magazine20/20, but you probably didn't know that she has been an avid giraffophile since a visit to the African wilderness nearly twenty-five years ago.The days of the giraffe being overlooked and under-appreciated are over with the publishing of Tall Blondes,a one-of-a-kind book about a one-of-a-kind animal. The giraffe's unusually long neck and legs make it one of the most recognizable creatures on our planet. But it also possesses a wide range of other fascinating and endearing traits and features. And while most giraffes areblondes, they come in beautiful arrays of red, brown, and even white.Sherr traces the cultural history of the giraffe, from it's first appearance in Europe in 46 B.C. (thanks to Julius Caesar) through medieval bestiaries and up to the modern giraffe star of a TV movie. The book is not just about giraffes in the wild: it's about how they have impacted on humans (and visa versa), stirring the imaginations of artists, writers and thinkers. Taking a whimsical approach to her very serious subject, Sherr has filled it with little-known tidbits, awe-inspiring photographs and drawings, and intriguing tales about the world's tallest land animal.Read it, and you'll not only learn about why Sherr (a tall blond herself) has fallen head over heals for this gawky but graceful animal-you'll fall in love too.",

        "Title": "The Ottomans: Dissolving Images",
        "Authors": "By Wheatcroft, Andrew",
        "Description": "The Ottomans elude us, as mysterious now as they have been for four and a half centuries. Were they the bloodthirsty savages of one legend, spitting babies on their swords, and enslaving all who crossed their path? Or were they sybarites, with an eye only for a fine silk robe, a unique black tulip, a beautiful Circassian?The Ottomans were all - and none - of these. In this book the author teases out those qualities which were uniquely Ottoman. Not Turkish, not Middle Eastern, nor even a shadowy echo of the west. For the Ottomans, born warriors from the steppes of Central Asia, became a unique urban culture, the successors of Rome in a political sense but quite unlike any culture before or since. Yet it is wrong to talk of the Ottomans in the past tense, for their legacy is alive in the Middle East and in parts of Europe to this day. And no country has to live in so ambivalent a relationship to its Ottoman past as Turkey itself.The great British, Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian empires are gone - for long they despised the Ottomans, 'The Sick Man of Europe'; and yet the Ottomans outlasted all of them. And today, the pervasive influence of the 'Ottoman style' is still present throughout the Middle East. Four hundred years of a culture cannot be extinguished at the stroke of a pen or some notional redrawing of boundaries on the map.This book focuses on the inner life of the Ottoman world as seen through western eyes. It asks how it was that the 'Ottoman way' flourished and survived over so many centuries, even as the imperial power crumbled, and suggests that being an Ottoman is an attitude of mind.For more than ten years Andrew Wheatcroft has been collecting and interpreting evidence from the old empire. Much of his work has been with the subject peoples of the Ottomans, so he sees less 'The Sick Man of Europe', so prevalent in western accounts, and more 'The Terrible Turk', which was the experience of Muslims and Christians alike. He now seeks to represent a culture long misunderstood and shamefully neglected.",

        "Description": "Got Kids?Get Mrs. Clean Jean's Housekeeping with Kids!From staying sane while sharing a bathroom (whether with teens or with toddlers in the throes of toilet training) to getting the kids to pitch in on laundry day (and keep the darks separate!), Mrs. Clean Jeans brings a wealth of tried-and-true tactics to the rescue. Her motto is \"You didn't make this mess all by yourself, so why should you have to clean it up?\" So she's figured out all the ingenious ways to get your kids to help you do the chores--or even do them all by themselves! Mrs. Clean Jeans starts with strategies, including involving the whole family, letting kids pick their favorite chores, having a set chore time so everybody's working together, and keeping chores reasonable, plus, of course, giving suitable rewards for jobs well done. Then she takes readers room by room, showing how to create kid-friendly storage, make sure things get picked up, avoid fights and confusion, and see to it that everything gets done--including the dishes. Packed with firsthand tips from the author's years of cleaning with three kids (now ages 3 through 13), Mrs. Clean Jeans' Housekeeping with Kids is the ultimate household help book",
