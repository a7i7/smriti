Four years later, European mercenaries find themselves stranded on the coast of North Africa - with an embarrassing corpse- in \"The Logistics of Carthage\" by Mary Gentle.In Walter Jon Williams's \"The Last Ride of German Freddie,\" a mysterious Old World figure stalks Tombstone, Arizona, as a cardsharp, trading philosophy - and lead - with the likes of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday.",

        "Description": "When the marines -- or \"jarheads,\" as they call themselves -- were sent in 1990 to Saudi Arabia to fight the Iraqis, Swofford was there, with a hundred-pound pack on his shoulders and a sniper's rifle in his hands. It was one misery upon another. He lived in sand for six months, his girlfriend back home betrayed him for a scrawny hotel clerk, he was punished by boredom and fear, he considered suicide, he pulled a gun on one of his fellow marines, and he was shot at by both Iraqis and Americans. At the end of the war, Swofford hiked for miles through a landscape of incinerated Iraqi soldiers and later was nearly killed in a booby-trapped Iraqi bunker.  Swofford weaves this experience of war with vivid accounts of boot camp, reflections on the mythos of the marines, and remembrances of battles with lovers and family. As engagement with the Iraqis draws closer, he is forced to consider what it is to be an American, a soldier, a son of a soldier, and a man.  Jarhead insists we remember the Americans who are wounded or killed, the fields of smoking enemy corpses left behind, and the continuing difficulty that American soldiers have reentering civilian life.  A harrowing yet inspiring portrait of a tormented consciousness struggling for inner peace, Jarhead will elbow for room on that short shelf of American war classics.",

The automobile altered everything, from the way crimes were committed to the way courtships were conducted, and the car itself came to embody power and independence, becoming the ultimate erotic accessory--a sexual object of sometimes ambiguous gender.In Highways to Heaven, Christopher Finch chronicles the dramatic rise of the automobile and describes how it transformed the American landscape and the American psyche. He evokes the ambitious men who created a giant industry and shows how that industry, and our passion for the automobile, shaped the world we live in today--the world of freeways and exurbs, of shopping malls and fast-food franchises--even determining the character of whole cities like Los Angeles.",

His ideas of adult fun are more than she can handle, so she packs her bags and walks out of his luxury Florida apartment, heading back to Washington DC in search of a regular life with a regular guy. But for a girl like Audrey, this is not as easy as it sounds. When Patrick Dugan, the charismatic owner of an old-world bar, fixes Audrey in his sights, some strange alliances are about to be formed. Within a week Audrey talks her way into a job at Patrick's bar and a room in the apartment he shares with a drag queen jazz singer called Basil. The highly sexed roommates are soon getting intimate with each other, even experimenting with games of kinky SM sex. But Audrey soon suspects that Patrick is not all that he seems. Why is he pretending to be gay? And what is he covering up for his father, a pillar of the local community? Audrey is so affected by the enigmatic, dominant barman that she doesn't realise they are connected by a mutual adversary - a cold-hearted man who will take them all down if he doesn't get what he wants.",

        "Title": "An Hour Before Daylight: Memories of a Rural Boyhood",
        "Authors": "By Carter, Jimmy",
        "Description": "In an American story of enduring importance, Jimmy Carter re-creates his Depression-era boyhood on a Georgia farm, before the civil rights movement that changed it and the country.  In what is sure to become a classic, the bestselling author of Living Faith and Sources of Strength writes about the powerful rhythms of countryside and community in a sharecropping economy. Along the way, he offers an unforgettable portrait of his father, a brilliant farmer and strict segregationist who treated black workers with his own brand of \"separate\" respect and fairness, and his strong-willed and well-read mother, a nurse who cared for all in need -- regardless of their position in the community. Carter describes the five other people who shaped his early life, only two of them white: his eccentric relatives who sometimes caused the boy to examine his heritage with dismay; the boyhood friends with whom he hunted with slingshots and boomerangs and worked the farm, but who could not attend the same school; and the eminent black bishop who refused to come to the Carters' back door but who would stand near his Cadillac in the front yard discussing crops and politics with Jimmy's father.  Carter's clean and eloquent prose evokes a time when the cycles of life were predictable and simple and the rules were heartbreaking and complex. In his singular voice and with a novelist's gift for detail, Jimmy Carter creates a sensitive portrait of an era that shaped the nation. An Hour Before Daylight is destined to stand with other timeless works of American literature.",

Captured in Witness Iraq are the trials and tribulations of the coalition forces and the Iraqi people as the universally recognized terror of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime is brought to an end by U.S.-led coalition forces. Showcasing dramatic and compelling scenes of the three-week war, the book begins with the missile launch on Iraqi leadership targets and continues through the massive roll-out of tanks and troops in the desert, and from the fight of the Kurds in the North to the anticlimactic\u2014but no less dramatic\u2014fall of Baghdad. Witness the desperation of Iraqi soldiers as they attempt to surrender. Witness in unprecedented detail the jubilation in Baghdad when the famed huge statue of Saddam Hussein is toppled. Feel the empathy of a U.S. soldier as he cradles a gravely injured Iraqi child. Although this has become history\u2019s most photographed military conflict, most photographs in this book have not been seen before. These images take you inside the war and show courage, tragedy, humor, and compassion, portraying the chaos of conflict as well as the respect and empathy for human life. Through these images, you will witness not only the realities of war but also the triumph of the human spirit.",

Spectacular photographs, using hundreds of leaves and petals, illustrate the gardener's color wheel and the effects you can produce. Stunning garden pictures look at form, texture, scale, distance, and changes in natural light - all factors that influence our reaction to color.Season-by-season themes present Malcolm Hillier's decidedly adventurous way of combining colors. A checkerboard palette of plants brings together all the colors we familiarly associate with a given season. For each theme, annotated flower-and-foliage swatches review how his mix of colors reflects and gives rise to different emotions. Glorious photographs, taken on location, suggest how to carry the themes into your own garden.",

Meyer Nudelman came to America from Russia at the turn of the twentieth century, when he was nineteen. Pursuing the immigrant\u2019s dream of a better life but finding the opposite, he lived an endless round of frustration, despair, anger, and loss: overwhelmed by the premature deaths of his first son and wife; his oldest surviving son disabled by rheumatic fever in his teens; his youngest son, Sherwin, dutiful but defiant, caring for him as his life, beset by illness and fierce bitterness, wound to its unalterable end.Lost in America, Nuland\u2019s harrowing and empathetic account of his father\u2019s life, is equally revealing about the author himself. We see what it cost him to admit the inextricable ties between father and son and to accept the burden of his father\u2019s legacy.In Lost in America, Sherwin Nuland has written a memoir at once timeless and universal.",

A sensitive innocent, she escapes the harsh realities of her garrison home-town to become a servant in Rembrandt's household. She soon becomes his lover and closest confidante, filling the void in his life resulting from the death of his wife and two of their children. 'Reborn at twenty' in Rembrandt's studio, enlightened by the positive values of beauty, truth, love and art, Hendrickje is fated to discover the hypocrisy and fickleness of Amsterdam society, which ostracises her and precipitates Rembrandt's final collapse.In a serene, sensuous style of writing, Matton paints a powerful fictional portrait of this impassioned relationship in the fascinating context of a turbulent era of Dutch history.",

        "Title": "The Amorous Busboy of Decatur Avenue: A Child of the Fifties Looks Back",
        "Authors": "By Klein, Robert",
        "Description": "Dear Reader,  When we asked the beloved award-winning comedian and actor Robert Klein to write a book, you can imagine our utter surprise when he told us that he wanted to write about sixth-century Chinese pottery. Thankfully, he hit a creative brick wall (since he doesn't really know anything about pottery from China or anywhere else). Then came similar failures to write books about sea turtles, circumnavigation of the globe, building jet engines at home, the sociology of chickens, or fungi of the skin.  Luckily, Mr. Klein's paramount concern was the consumer. He knew that if we, his publishers, were going to boldly ask you to purchase his book (see above for price), he would have to write something so good, so worthwhile, so meaningful as to make you want to send additional money to your bookseller in gratitude for having allowed you to partake in this reading experience.  So Mr. Klein set out to write about what he knows best: himself. This book is about the adventures of a child who becomes a young man: how he thinks and dreams and lusts and fears and laughs and handles adversity.    From the beginning of his distinguished career as a comedian, Robert Klein established himself as a pioneer in observational humor and razor-sharp routines that are infectiously funny. Now -- for the first time -- Klein brings his trademark humor and honesty to the printed page. In this portrait of a comic as a young man, Klein takes us back to the people and streets of his Bronx neighborhood, the eccentric cast of characters in the Catskills hotels and bungalow colonies where he worked, the college dorms where he received more than an academic education, the 1964 World's Fair where he fell in love, New York City and Chicago in the 1960s as he developed his talent, and Los Angeles just as he was about to embark on a show business career. Throughout, Klein reveals the hilarity of growing up and explores the mysteries and his own foibles in sex and relationships. He recounts with wit and poignancy losing his virginity with a prostitute, bringing home a German girlfriend to his Jewish family, and the amorous adventures of the busboy he once was.  With an ego more fragile than Chinese pottery, Robert Klein has written a funny and evocative coming-of-age memoir -- well worth the price (if we say so ourselves). Enjoy.  All the best, The Publisher",
