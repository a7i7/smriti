        "Authors": "By Wharton, Jim, Wharton, Phil, and Browning, Bev",
        "Description": "Whether you're a serious competitor or weekend warrior, you know that proper stretching before and after your workout can improve your performance, increase your flexibility, help prevent injury, and make you feel better. But did you know that the traditional way of stretching -- lock your knees, bounce, hold, hurt, hold longer -- actually makes muscles tighter and more prone to injury?There's a new and better way to stretch: Active-Isolated Stretching. And with The Whartons' Stretch Book,\u00a0\u00a0the method used successfully by scores of professional, amateur, and Olympic athletes is now available to everyone.This groundbreaking technique, developed by researchers, coaches, and trainers, and pioneered by Jim and Phil Wharton, is your new exercise prescription. The routine is simple: First, you prepare to stretch one isolated muscle at a time. Then you actively contract the muscle opposite the isolated muscle, which will then relax in preparation for its stretch. You stretch it gently and quickly -- for no more than two seconds -- and release it before it goes into its protective contraction. Then you repeat. Simple, but the results are outstanding. The Whartons' Stretch Book explains it all. Part I contains the Active-Isolated Stretch Catalog, with fully illustrated, easy-to-follow stretches for each of five body zones, from neck and shoulders to trunk, arms, and legs -- over fifty stretches in all. Part II offers specific stretching prescriptions for over fifty-five sports and activities, from running, tennis, track, and aerobics to skiing, skating, and swimming. You'll also find advice on stretching for daily activities such as driving, working at a desk, lifting, and keyboarding. Part III discusses stretching for life, with specific recommendations for expectant mothers and older athletes. It also includes specific stretching exercises that could help you avoid unnecessary surgery.Give Active-Isolated Stretching a try for three weeks. You'll never go back to your old stretching routines again.",

With his trademark humor and brilliant anecdotes, Lewis paints the mood and market factors leading up to each event, weaves contemporary accounts to show what people thought was happening at the time, and then, with the luxury of hindsight, analyzes what actually happened and what we should have learned from experience.As he proved in Liar's Poker, The New New Thing, and Moneyball, Lewis is without peer in his understanding of market forces and human foibles. He is also, arguably, the funniest serious writer in America.",

In the midst of so many changes, the most meaningful things can sometimes go unsaid. It's particularly important at times like these to keep open the lines of communication... to give parents an opportunity to share their hopes, advice, and life experiences; to empower teenagers with some well-deserved encouragement as they find their way in a challenging world.This book is especially for those times. It's a reminder to parents and children alike that the teenage years are not just to be endured, but enjoyed to the fullest -- for they are creating memories that will be treasured forever. It's for every teen who needs to hear how special they are, and for every parent who wants to share some beautiful thoughts... with their wonderful teenager.\"I love you beyond all words. And I promise that I will love you beyond all time. So many treasures await you in your journey of life... and being blessed with you... has been mine.\"  - Douglas Pagels",

        "Authors": "By Gray, Alice and Stephens, Steve",
        "Description": "Every woman longs to be appreciated, respected, and adored, but when her needs aren\u2019t met within her marriage, she could be tempted to walk away. As little hurts and disappointments accumulate and her heart hardens, a woman\u2019s loneliness and vulnerability take over, and she might find emotional fulfillment elsewhere, perhaps in even a casual encounter with another man. When the marriage enters this realm of real danger, the woman believes it will be less painful to walk away than try to work on it. With heart and wisdom, Dr. Steve Stephens and Alice Gray offer practical advice for how to stop this epidemic of walk-out women. They outline the warning signs of severe marital discontent and share how to reconnect with your spouse, communicate your hurt, and open your heart. If both partners are willing to work at it, any marriage can be saved.Are You Even Thinking About Walking Out?  \u201cI\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t think it is worth the effort anymore.\u201d  \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m staying is because of the children.\u201d  \u201cSurely God doesn\u2019t want me to be this unhappy.\u201d  Every woman longs to be appreciated, valued, and cared for. When these needs go unmet, she may be tempted to leave the husband she once loved\u2014but walking out is seldom the path to happiness.  Like trusted friends, Dr. Steve Stephens and Alice Gray offer wise and gentle advice to restore hope to your marriage. You\u2019ll discover proven methods for how you can move toward each other rather than away, build up instead of tear down, and find love rather than lose it.  Story Behind the BookAlthough a growing number of women are walking away from their marriages, there are no books to help them realize that this is not the path to happiness. A woman\u2019s discontentment settles like dust on furniture, and although she tries, she fails to make her husband understand. His responses seem too little and too late. Many women mistakenly believe it is easier emotionally to leave the marriage than try to restore it. We want a woman to realize that even when her heart seems closed to her husband, there is a way to open it and become one again. Loss of love does not equal loss of marriage. Loss of hope does not mean the relationship should be abandoned.",

And as Billy Bob's grandfather once told him, you do well in life by keeping the roots in a clear stream and not letting anyone taint the water for you. But in Holland's dusty little hometown of Deaf Smith, in the hill country north of Austin, local kingpin Earl Deitrich has made a fortune running roughshod and tainting anyone who stands in his way. Billy Bob has problems with Deitrich and his shamelessly callous demeanor, but can't shake the legacy of his passion for Deitrich's \"heartbreak-beautiful\" wife, Peggy Jean.When Holland takes on the defense of Wilbur Pickett\u2014a man accused of stealing an heirloom and three hundred thousand dollars in bonds from Deitrich's office--he finds himself up against not only Earl's power and influence, but also a past Billy Bob can't will away.\u00a0\u00a0A wonderfully realized novel, rich in Texas atmosphere and lore, and a dazzling portrait of the deadly consequences of self-delusion, Heartwood could only have been written by James Lee Burke, a writer in expert command of his craft.",

One of them is Pavel Kazakov, a Russian oilman with close ties to organized crime, and an audacious idea: Build a huge pipeline through the Balkans, get the Russian army to back him, and everybody gets rich. Sure, NATO will object, but the new president\u2019s emphatic decision that American will no longer be the world\u2019s policeman guarantees no effective opposition. Russia will dominate Europe. Kazakov will dominate the oil supply. He hasn\u2019t reckoned with Patrick McLanahan, however. The young Air Force general leads a combat mission deep into Russia to rescue a spy on the ground, but when things start to spin out of control, McLanahan\u2019s intuition is to push it even further, to create whatever havoc he can. That puts him directly in opposition to the president himself, and pretty soon McLanahan and his team find themselves faced with a dire choice. Which is the greater threat: the empire in front of them&#151;or the president behind? Whichever way they choose, life as they know it will never be the same.",
