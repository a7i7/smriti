        "Title": "The Clinton Tapes: Wrestling History with the President",
        "Authors": "By Branch, Taylor",
        "Description": "A GROUNDBREAKING BOOK about the modern presidency, The Clinton Tapes invites readers into private dialogue with a gifted, tormented, resilient President of the United States. Here is what President Clinton thought and felt but could not say in public.   This book rests upon a secret project, initiated by Clinton, to preserve for future historians an unfiltered record of presidential experience. During his eight years in office, between 1993 and 2001, Clinton answered questions and told stories in the White House, usually late at night. His friend Pulitzer Prize-winning author Taylor Branch recorded seventy-nine of these dialogues to compile a trove of raw information about a presidency as it happened. Clinton drew upon the diary transcripts for his memoir in 2004.   Branch recorded his own detailed recollections immediately after each session, covering not only the subjects discussed but also the look and feel of each evening with the president. The text engages Clinton from many angles. Readers hear candid stories, feel buffeting pressures, and weigh vivid descriptions of the White House settings.   Branch's firsthand narrative is confessional, unsparing, and personal. The author admits straying at times from his primary role -- to collect raw material for future historians -- because his discussions with Clinton were unpredictable and intense. What should an objective prompter say when the President of the United States seeks advice, argues facts, or lodges complaints against the press? The dynamic relationship that emerges from these interviews is both affectionate and charged, with flashes of anger and humor. President Clinton drives the history, but this story is also about friends.   The Clinton Tapes highlights major events of Clinton's two terms, including wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, the failure of health care reform, peace initiatives on three continents, the anti-deficit crusade, and titanic political struggles from Whitewater to American history's second presidential impeachment trial. Along the way, Clinton delivers colorful portraits of countless political figures and world leaders from Nelson Mandela to Pope John Paul II.   These unprecedented White House dialogues will become a staple of presidential scholarship. Branch's masterly account opens a new window on a controversial era and Bill Clinton's eventual place among our chief executives.",

But it\u2019s in that serene place that Jeremy meets Clara Mulpas, whom he tries his hardest to seduce.

Jeremy isn\u2019t sure how to press his case\u2014but he won\u2019t give up. Wilder\u2019s prose is elegant, spare and affecting.

        "Description": "When was the last time you were truly gripped by God's greatness?Most Christians recall heartfelt resolutions around a fire at bible camp  as children or a revival meeting. But what causes the fervor of those experiences  to translate into a consistent life pattern? Pastor and author James MacDonald  believes that the better we understand God, the better we understand ourselves,  and the less likely we are to favor our own will over God's. He writes, \"God  is not safe and He will not be squeezed into some neat, respectable Sunday discussion...  No. To know God at all is to watch Him explode any box we put Him in with His terror,  majesty, and indescribable wonder.'\"Expounding upon Isaiah's encounters  with God, MacDonald prods snoozing saints to rediscover the wonder of God's attributes.  He also shares candidly from his experiences in life and ministry where God proved  Himself to be the Great I AM. This book will spur new and seasoned believers  alike to detest mediocrity in their spiritual walks. Ideal for individual or small  group study.",

        "Authors": "By Ehrlich, Robert",
        "Description": "AIDS is not caused by HIV. Coal and oil are not fossil fuels. Radiation exposure is good for you. Distributing more guns reduces crime. These ideas make headlines, but most educated people scoff at them. Yet some of science's most important concepts-from gravity to evolution-have surfaced from the pool of crazy ideas. In fact, a good part of science is distinguishing between useful crazy ideas and those that are just plain nutty. In this book, a well-known physicist with an affinity for odd ideas applies his open mind to nine controversial propositions on topical subjects. Some, it turns out, are considerably lower on the cuckoo scale than others.  Robert Ehrlich evaluates, for the general reader or student, nine seemingly far-out propositions culled from physics, biology, and social science. In the process, he demonstrates in easy-to-understand terms how to weigh an argument, judge someone's use of statistics, identify underlying assumptions, and ferret out secret agendas. His conclusions are sometimes surprising. For instance, he finds that while HIV does cause AIDS and the universe almost certainly started with a big bang, our solar system could have two suns, faster-than-light particles might exist, and time travel can't be ruled out as mere science fiction.  Anyone interested in unorthodox ideas will get a kick out of this book. And, as a fun way of learning how to think like a scientist, it has enormous educational value. Of course, only time will tell whether any of these nine ideas will be the next continental drift--the now orthodox account of the Earth's geology that was for years just a crazy idea.",

His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man\u2019s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka\u2019s masterpiece, \u201c&&LI&&RThe Metamorphosis&&L/I&&R,\u201d a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. &&LP&&RBringing together some of Kafka\u2019s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author\u2019s artistry. \u201c&&LI&&RThe Judgment&&L/I&&R,\u201d which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and \u201c&&LI&&RThe Stoker&&L/I&&R,\u201d which became the first chapter of his novel &&LI&&RAmerika&&L/I&&R, are here included. These two, along with \u201c&&LI&&RThe Metamorphosis&&L/I&&R,\u201d form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as \u201cThe Sons,\u201d and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family. &&L/P&&R&&LP&&RAlso included are \u201c&&LI&&RIn the Penal Colony&&L/I&&R,\u201d a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and \u201c&&LI&&RA Hunger Artist&&L/I&&R,\u201d about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public.

She reveals both the very private woman and the acclaimed author behind the enduring classics Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Emma. With its fascinating insights into the writing process from an award\u2013winning novelist, Carol Shields\u2019s magnificent biography of Jane Austen is also a compelling meditation on how great fiction is created.",
