        "Description": "Beginning with the introduction of the steam locomotive, followed by the development of iron railroads, the North American railroads impacted the nation in ways unseen by anyone before or since. Just under two centuries ago, not even the most gifted of visionaries could have foreseen the impact on the development of the United States of America that would follow the introduction of the steam locomotive. Then, in the second quarter of the 19th century, the trails of horse-drawn wagon trains were quickly followed by the iron railroads with steam locomotives hauling an ever larger and more diverse assortment of loads - humans, animal and freight. So while the horse may have opened up the North American continent, its real exploitation was made possible by the steam-hauled railroad service. Whereas it had taken weeks, if not months, to take long journeys within and across the U.S.A., the advent of the railroad permitted such journeys to be completed in days, or at worst weeks. While the steam locomotive did not complete the exploration and opening of the U. S. A., it was essential to its development in social, political and economic terms, in the last half of the 19th century turning a small, poorly populated and economically insignificant nation into a huge, rapidly growing and economically powerfully entity that had come to rival the most advance European nations.",

This book helps men understand their anger by explaining what the specific symptoms of chronic anger are and by showing angry men how their actions negatively affect family, friends, and coworkers. It helps men control violent feelings by using simple exercises - developed especially for men - to identify when and why anger occurs and by helping them form new habits to prevent anger before it starts. Women, too, will learn essential strategies for understanding and helping the angry men in their lives. Beyond Anger is honest, tough, and real.",

Marie Peterssen, an ambitious young aviation reporter, has a hunch about the crashes, and her suspicions are confirmed when she\u2019s approached by Julian Granot, an Israeli airline security expert and former Special Forces commando who has noticed her work. Julian offers Marie a rare lead, one that will send her to London and later into the devastation of war-torn Iraq.  With the help of a maverick FBI agent, Morgan Ensley, Marie stumbles onto the makings of a terrorist plot well beyond the destruction of airliners: the detonation of a rogue nuclear device in New York Harbor. The terrorists know that America\u2019s most vulnerable spot is its transportation system, and they mean to exploit it. Time is short.But Marie is in the grip of circumstances beyond her control. Julian\u2019s intentions are unclear: Is he helping a journalist uncover answers the world craves, or is he setting up the girl to flush out an Islamic terrorist who killed Julian\u2019s partner twenty years earlier?Julian holds the key, but Marie\u2019s role in the frantic race to unravel the plot grows when she learns that she may be tied to the terrorist leader in a more personal way.  Author Emily Benedek was writing an article on counterterrorism for Newsweek when she came into contact with a high-level Israeli counterterrorism expert.  Due to his ongoing role in international investigations, much of what she learned in the course of their talks could only be told in a novel.  What emerges from those meetings is a bone-chilling story of suspense, as thrilling as it is plausible.",

        "Title": "Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency",
        "Authors": "By Gellman, Barton",
        "Description": "Dick Cheney changed history, defining his times and shaping a White House as no vice president has before--yet concealing most of his work from public view. Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman shows how Cheney operated, why, and what he wrought. This is a work of careful, concrete, and original reporting backed by hundreds of interviews with close Cheney allies as well as rivals, many speaking candidly on the record for the first time. It is a study of the inner workings of theBush administration and the vice president's central role as the administration's canniest power player. Gellman exposes the mechanics of Cheney's largely successful post-September 11 campaign to win unchecked power for the commander in chief, and reflects upon, and perhaps changes, the legacy that Cheney--and the Bush administration as a whole--will leave as they exit office.--From publisher description.",

My hope is that you'll consider my words and remember my heart.  Harry Whitney is dying. And in the process, he's losing his mind. Afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, he knows his \"good\" time is dwindling. Wishing to be remembered as more than an ailing old man, Harry realizes the greatest gift he can pass on is the wisdom of his years, the jumbled mix of experiences and emotions that add up to a life. And so he compiles a book of his poems for his favorite granddaughter, Emily, in the hope that his words might somehow heal the tenuous relationships in a family that is falling apart.  But Harry's poems contain much more than meets the eye....As Emily and her family discover, intricate messages are hidden in them, clues and riddles that lead to an extraordinary cache of letters, and even a promise of hidden gold. Are they the ramblings of a man losing touch with reality? Or has Harry given them a gift more valuable than any of them could have guessed? As Harry's secrets are uncovered one by one, his family learns about romance, compassion, and hope -- and together they set out to search for something priceless, a shining prize to treasure forever. They may grow closer in spirit or be torn apart by greed...but their lives will be undeniably altered by Harry's words in his letters for Emily.",

We should not try to manipulate and hustle ourselves into a place of advantage with God, a position that has been ours all along. After all, God is the one who climbed down the ladder to be with us. Using true anecdotes from the men, women, and families of the churches he has served, Barnes invites hard-running, stressed-out, burned-out people to stop striving. Life is not something we grasp and clutch to us, but a gift God freely gives. Only when we open our hands can God fill them with the blessings he has been waiting to lavish upon us all along.",
