        "Description": "Everybody wants to hire super performers - but people don't come with a guarantee attached. So how do you know which prospective employees will perform successfully on the job - and which will not?You'll be far better able to predict success if you follow the proven techniques in Michael Mercer's Hire the Best...and Avoid the Rest. This pragmatic guide removes much of the uncertainty and inefficiency from the hiring process, showing you how to make the most of the three key tools: interviewing, testing, and reference checking.For many employers, testing, interviewing, and reference checking can pose a tough dilemma: how to gain essential, sometimes sensitive, information without violating legal and ethical constraints. Throughout the book, Mercer emphasizes four guiding principles: Make sure every action you take is objective, valid, reliable, and applied in a nondiscriminatory manner. You'll find out everything you need to know to hire the best and avoid the rest - fairly and legally.Hiring dependable, honest, and productive employees has always been a key management need. \"Not all benefits can be measured strictly in dollars and cents. Yet many bottom-line improvements can probably be traced ultimately to hiring high-achievers and avoiding underachievers, asserts Mercer. Hire the Best...and Avoid the Rest provides a proven model for selecting the most promising candidates and improving your entire company's performance for years to come.",

        "Description": "In a front-page profile, The Wall Street Journal said, \"Mr. Pacetta's experience shows how one hard-charging personality can quickly revitalize a moribund sales office.\" But, as Frank Pacetta explains in Don't Fire Them, Fire Them Up, there's more to it than just one person.When Frank Pacetta became district manager of Xerox's Cleveland sales office, that district was a disaster area, dragging along near the bottom of Xerox's national organization. Within a year, Pacetta had turned it around, making Cleveland first in the region and fourth nationally out of sixty-five sales districts. And it was no fluke. Pacetta left Cleveland to turn Xerox's Columbus district from a loser into a winner.Don't Fire Them, Fire Them Up tells the reader how to build a winning business team: how to develop trust, create loyalty, and generate enthusiasm and excitement. It explains how to build or rebuild an organization, lead and energize it, and put it on top and keep it there, year after year after year.This book is chock-full of practical, proven tips on leadership and management, everything from motivation to communication to all the nuts and bolts of selling successfully. It's all here - the warning signs that tell you trouble lies ahead: employees who arrive at work late and leave early, who complain about the customers while the customers complain about them, who see problems but not opportunities, and who don't know what the competition is up to. Pacetta includes his Top Ten Tips, which were featured in The Wall Street Journal story and have been copied and posted on office bulletin boards everywhere, and he adds Ten More Top Tips in this book.Don't Fire Them, Fire Them Up is a real-world story of winning in business by motivating employees in the most positive way possible - nurturing them, showing that you value accomplishment, and giving them the skills and the responsibility to become winners.",

        "Title": "Everest : Mountain Without Mercy",
        "Authors": "By Coburn, Broughton, Cahill, Tim (INT), and Breasbears, David",
        "Description": "Less than half a century ago, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first humans to stand atop Mount Everest and gaze outward from the highest point on our planet. Since their historic ascent, scores of other climbing expeditions have attempted these forbidding heights and many have succeeded. But though she can be climbed, \"the Mother Goddess of the World\" cannot be conquered.  Few know this as well as David Breashears. The first American to scale Everest twice, he was a veteran of nine previous Himalayan filmmaking expeditions when he agreed to lead what became his most challenging filmmaking experience. The expedition was organized by large-format motion picture producer MacGillivray Freeman Films and was comprised of an international team of climbers. Their goal was to carry a specially modified 48-pound IMAX\u00ae motion picture camera to the summit of Everest and return from the top of the world with the first footage ever shot there in this spectacular format. Even in the best of conditions, Breashears knew, Everest is a daunting challenge -- but in May 1996, the mountain proved how deadly it can really be.  A stunningly illustrated portrait of life and death in a hostile, high-altitude environment where no human can survive for long, Everest invites you to join Breashears, his climbers, and his crew as they make photographic history. Author Broughton Coburn traces each step of the team's progress toward a rendezvous with history -- and suddenly you're on the scene of a disaster that riveted the world's attention. Everest incorporates a first-person, on-the-scene account of the most tragic event in the mountain's history: The May 10, 1996, blizzard that claimed eight lives, including two of the world's top climbing expedition leaders. It is a chronicle of the courage and cooperation that resulted in the rescue of several men and women who were trapped on the lethal, windswept slopes. Everest is also a tale of triumph. In a struggle to overcome both the physical and emotional effects of the disaster on Everest, Breashears and his team rise to the challenge of achieving their goal -- humbled by the mountain's overwhelming power, yet exhilarated by their own accomplishment.  Arresting photographs taken by members of this courageous team capture the glory and grandeur of the highest mountains in the world -- and the grim toll they often demand. Its pages present the expertise of prominent scientists, the hard-won experience of world-class adventures, and the first-person accounts of expedition climbers including Jamling Norgay, son of Tenzing Norgay, who fulfilled a dream of following in his father's footsteps, and Dr. Beck Weathers, who after miraculously surviving a night on Everest without shelter, is rescued by helicopter in one of the highest rescue efforts in history.  Illustrated with detailed maps and more than one hundred and thirty dramatic photographs, Everest encapsulates the culture, the history, and the adventure that surround this",

        "Title": "Learned Hand : The Man and the Judge",
        "Authors": "By Gunther, Gerald",
        "Description": "A masterful, moving account of the life and work of one of the great judges of the twentieth century, whose work has left a profound mark on our legal, intellectual, and social landscape. The greatest judge never to be appointed to the Supreme Court, Learned Hand is widely considered the peer of Justices Holmes, Brandeis, and Cardozo. In his more than fifty years on the bench, he left an unequaled legacy of lastingly influential writings. This distinctive biography goes well beyond Hand's official work, however, to depict both a complex human being and the times in which he lived. The first to draw on the enormous collection of the judge's private papers, the eminent constitutional scholar Gerald Gunther vividly portrays a public man consumed by private doubts. Gunther's lively account moves from Hand's childhood in a formidable (and anxiety producing) family of lawyers to his years at Harvard as a studious outsider, his frustrating experience in private law practice, his felt inadequacies in marriage, and his work as a federal judge. Throughout his life, Hand believed himself unworthy of the accolades bestowed upon him; self-doubt permeated all aspects of his life.Gunther subtly explores the ties between the modest, uncertain man - a liberal skeptic who was never \"too sure [he was] right\" - and his public record, and suggests that Hand's personal traits shaped his modest approach to judging: the questioning human being could not help acting that way as a judge. Hand's most enduring legacy is his advocacy of judicial restraint: repeatedly he sounded the dangers of excessive activism in unelected judges. Yet he mustered the courage to support such basic values as freedom of expression - from his personally costly defense of dissenters amid the hysteria of World War I to his strong affirmation of free speech in his rulings on obscenity and his outspoken attacks on McCarthyism in the 1950s.This biography also offers the perspective of one of this era's most sensitive public figures on the rich political and social history of the first six decades of the twentieth century. By examining Hand's voluminous correspondence with such acquaintances as Walter Lippmann, Felix Frankfurter, and Herbert Croly (with whom he was a founding contributor to The New Republic), Gunther illuminates Hand's intense involvement with the public issues of his times, such as his enthusiastic support of Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive party. Gunther gives us a graphic portrait of a complex and uncommon man whose thoughts and words inspired generations of Americans and continue to do so today.",

        "Description": "During a routine parent-teacher conference in November 1991, Echo Fling was told by her son's teacher that his behaviour in class was `not normal'. After two years at the pre-school, five-year-old Jimmy had failed to make any friends, had recently started to act aggressively towards his classmates, and was beginning to react violently to any changes in his routine. Echo was not taken completely by surprise: she had suspected for some time that her son was different from other children. Over the next five years, she and her husband accompanied Jimmy to doctors, medical specialists, learning consultants and psychologists. Finally, at the age of ten, Jimmy was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome.This is the book that Echo Fling needed when she first set out to have Jimmy diagnosed, and it will enable parents and teachers to understand and help other children with Asperger Syndrome.",

        "Description": "Creative folks often know all too well that the muse doesn\u2019t always strike when you want it to, or when the deadline for your next brilliant project is creeping up on you like an ill-fitting turtleneck. Originality doesn\u2019t follow a time clock, even when you have to. While conventional time management books offer tons of instruction for using time wisely, they are traditionally organized in a linear fashion, which just isn\u2019t helpful for the right-brain mind. In Time Management for the Creative Person, creativity guru Lee Silber offers real advice for using the strengths of artistic folks\u2014like originality and resourcefulness\u2014to adopt innovative time-saving solutions, such as:* Learning to say no when your plate is just too full* How to know when a good job, not a great one, is good enough* Making \u201cto do\u201d lists that include fun stuff, too\u2014that way you won\u2019t feel overwhelmed by work* Time-saving techniques around the house that give you more time to get your work done and more time to spend with your loved ones* The keys to clutter control that will keep your work space and your living space neatWith these and lots of other practical tips, Lee Silber will help anyone, from the time-starved caterer rushing to prepare for her next party to the preoccupied painter who forgets when the electric bill is due, make the most of their time and turn the clock and the calendar into friends, not foes.",

At the historically black college of Dillard University in the lush mystical city of New Orleans, the beautiful and serious Leslie Beaudet is struggling with a dark secret of power in a world that is pulling her in many different directions.  In the eyes of her Haitian immigrant father, Leslie is a queen who deserves more than the broken dreams and carnage of poverty. To her Black Indian mother, she is a source of pride and strength, a reason for carrying on. To her younger sister, already the mother of two and a high school dropout, Leslie is the only person who cares enough to share her woes. To her brother, she is the victim he failed to protect. To her college peers and teachers, Leslie is a determined, resourceful student, most likely to succeed, yet always impenetrably private.  When a series of murders befall her New Orleans community, they increasingly point in Leslie's direction. Slowly, her friends and relatives realize they've never really known Leslie -- a complicated young woman terrified of failure, struggling with painful family secrets, praying for security that has eluded everyone around her, and craving the power to change her fate, a power that was hidden from her until now...when it's too late to stop her.",

        "Description": "The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon left us stunned, angry, and uncomprehending. As it became clear that these horrifying acts had been committed in the name of religion, the media, the government, and ordinary citizens alike sought answers to questions about Islam and its adherents.In this level-headed and authoritative book, John L. Esposito, one of the world's most respected scholars of political Islam, provides answers. He clearly and carefully explains the teachings of Islam--the Quran, the example of the Prophet, Islamic law--about jihad or holy war, the use of violence, and terrorism. He chronicles the rise of extremist groups and examines their frightening worldview and tactics. Anti-Americanism (and anti-Europeanism), he shows, is a broad-based phenomenon that cuts across Arab and Muslim societies. It is not just driven by religious zealotry, but by frustration and anger at U.S. policy. It is vital to understand, however, that the vast majority of Muslims are appalled by the acts of violence committed in the name of their faith. It is essential that we distinguish between the religion of Islam and the actions of extremists like Osama bin Laden, who hijack Islamic discourse and belief to justify their acts of terrorism. This brief, clear-sighted book reflects twenty years of study, reflection, and experience on the part of a scholar who is equally respected in the West and in the Muslim world. It will prove to be the best single guide to the urgent questions that have recently forced themselves on the attention of the entire world.",

Or did someone push Antonia down the stairs of the family home? Surviving Antonia are an elderly father, Sir Adrian Morton, two bewildered school-aged children, and a former husband who has recently been released from prison.The reluctant executor of Antonia's estate, Celia has hardly arrived in Madeira when she encounters some very suspicious characters in and around the house. What are the true aims of the bizarre neighbors? Why is Antonia's ex-husband so anxious to gain custody of the children? And who took the valuable orchids that are missing from Sir Adrian's prized collection?The more Celia discovers about her dead niece, the more mysterious things become. She's so preoccupied that it takes her a while to realize that Sir Adrian's housekeeper, Maria, is - quite literally - terrified for her life.Bringing together one of the most unlikely and convincing sleuths in all of crime fiction, the stunning beauty of Madeira, and the devious plot twists that only an author like John Sherwood can devise, The Hanging Garden is classic mystery fiction at its best.",

It wasn?t until she entered the kitchen--and world--of her mother-in-law, Miriam, a Holocaust survivor, that Ehrlich began to understand the importance of preserving the traditions of the past. As Ehrlich looks on, Miriam methodically and lovingly prepares countless kosher meals while relating the often painful stories of her life in Poland and her immigration to America. These stories trigger a kind of religious awakening in Ehrlich, who--as she moves tentatively toward reclaiming the heritage she rejected as a young woman--gains a new appreciation of life?s possibilities, choices, and limitations.",

        "Description": "The teenage years are tough-for kids, and for parents. Many teenagers are grappling with a slew of overwhelming emotions, and the results can range from not wanting to be seen with a parent in public to reckless and destructive behavior that can destroy a family. Parents despair as a child becomes a sullen, defiant stranger.  A clinical psychologist who's spent more than two decades bringing families back from the brink, Dr. Neil I. Bernstein knows how to help parents and teens successfully navigate these difficult and trying years. Thoughtful, clear-eyed, comprehensive, and refreshingly free of jargon, HOW TO KEEP YOUR TEENAGER OUT OF TROUBLE AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN'T helps parents identify whether their teens are exhibiting typical behavior-such as locking themselves in their room for  hours-or are exhibiting real danger signs, such as being secretive, despondent, or constantly angry. And then he tells what to do about it. The focus, above all else, is effective communication: how to avoid threats and put-downs, offer clear explanations, stick with the issues at hand, negotiate, improve listening skills, ask relevant questions, and stop interrogating or lecturing. Throughout, Bernstein uses examples from his practice to tell specifically what to do and say. There is sample dialogue to keep discussions from becoming arguments; signals that parental efforts are actually working; and Skill Builders that give parents the tools they need to ensure their teenagers leave home as responsible, moral adults.",

Indeed, he argues that the popular \u201czero-sum\u201d way of thinking, according to which one side must lose if the other wins, often makes both sides worse off than they would be when bargaining for joint mutual gains.Using a vast array of specific cases and clear, helpful diagrams, Raiffa not only elucidates the step-by-step processes of negotiation but also translates this deeper understanding into practical guidelines for negotiators and \u201cintervenors.\u201d He examines the mechanics of negotiation in imaginative fashion, drawing on his extensive background in game theory and decision analysis, on his quarter-century of teaching nonspecialists in schools of business and public policy, on his personal experiences as director of an international institute dealing with East/West problems, and on the results of simulated negotiation exercises with hundreds of participants.There are popular books on the art of winning and scholarly books on the science of negotiation, but this is the first book to bridge the two currents. Shrewd, accessible, and engagingly written, it shows how a little analysis sprinkled with a touch of art can work to the advantage of any negotiator.",
