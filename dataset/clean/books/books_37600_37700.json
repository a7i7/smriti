        "Title": "Seeing in the Dark : How Backyard Stargazers Are Probing Deep Space and Guarding Earth from Interplanetary Peril",
        "Authors": "By Ferris, Timothy",
        "Description": "Seeing in the Dark is a poetic love letter to the skies and a stirring report on the revolution now sweeping amateur astronomy, in which backyard stargazers linked globally by the Internet are exploring deep space and making discoveries worthy of the professionals. Timothy Ferris invites us all to become stargazers, recounting his lifelong experiences as an enthralled stargazer, and capturing the exquisite experience when ancient starlight strikes the eye and incites the mind. Reporting from around the globe -- from England and Italy to the Florida Keys and the Chilean Andes -- on the revolution that's putting millions in touch with the night sky, Ferris also offers an authoritative and magical description of what is out there to be seen, from the rings of Saturn to remote quasars whose light is older than Earth. Astronomy is the most accessible and democratic of all the sciences: Anyone can get started in it just by going outside with a star chart on a dark night and looking up. A pair of binoculars suffices to see galaxies millions of light-years away, and a small telescope can probe what Ferris calls the \"blue waters\" of deep space. An accessible, nontechnical invitation to get to know the sky, Seeing in the Dark encourages readers to make the glories of the stars a part of their lives. \"The universe,\" Ferris writes, \"is accessible to all, and can inform one's existence with a sense of beauty, reason, and awe as enriching as anything to be found in music, art, or poetry.\" An appendix includes star charts, observing guides, and tips on how you can get involved with the night sky.",

        "Description": "High above the Rocky Mountains, a routine airline flight becomes a midair standoff as 130 passengers listen to their captain relate the unprecedented demands of an unseen hijacker. Federal and state officials must hunt down, arrest, and indict the murderer of a young girl, and do it all in eight hours - or the airplane will be blown out of the sky.With the airline in confusion, the media pursuing, and the hijacker forcing the aircraft into wild maneuvers as they head toward Salt Lake City, the FBI reluctantly fields its closest hostage negotiator, a rookie female agent and psychologist named Katherine Bronsky. Immediately, Bronsky finds herself sucked into the vortex of an impossible war of wills between a volatile, unstable hijacker holding the trigger to a bomb and stonewalling Justice Department officials who have no real intention of meeting the lone gunman's demands.Successful at last in getting him to land in a remote Colorado airport, Bronsky's brave and desperate attempts to reason with the hijacker backfire, and she becomes a hostage herself. Now discounted and ignored by her superiors in Washington for losing control, Bronsky's only hope to save the passengers and crew of AirBridge Flight 90 is to solve the wrenching mystery of who killed an eleven-year-old girl in a dark Connecticut forest two years before. And for that, all she has is an airborne phone and precious few hours before the bomb detonates.",

Bound to a life of servitude as a young girl in ancient China, where the life of a woman is valued less than that of livestock. Bound to be alone and unmarried, with no parents to arrange for a suitable husband. Dubbed \"Lazy One\" by her stepmother, Xing Xing spends her days taking care of her half sister, Wei Ping, who cannot walk because of her foot bindings, the painful but compulsory tradition for girls who are fit to be married. Even so, Xing Xing is content, for now, to practice her gift for poetry and calligraphy, to tend to the mysterious but beautiful carp in her garden, and to dream of a life unbound by the laws of family and society. But all of this is about to change as the time for the village's annual festival draws near, and Stepmother, who has spent nearly all of the family's money, grows desperate to find a husband for Wei Ping. Xing Xing soon realizes that this greed and desperation may threaten not only her memories of the past, but also her dreams for the future. In this searing story, Donna Jo Napoli, acclaimed author of Beast and Breath, delves into the roots of the Cinderella myth and unearths a tale as powerful as it is familiar.",

Moving back and forth in time, and among unforgettable characters and their stories, Walker crosses conventional borders of all kinds as she explores in this magical novel the ways in which a woman's denied sexuality leads to the loss of the much prized and necessary original self; and how she regains that self, even as her family's past of lies and love is transformed.",

        "Authors": "By Frank, Scott M. and Heller, Andy",
        "Description": "Facing a volatile stock market, many people have turned to real estate as a way to invest their hard-earned money. While many investors opt to buy property and then sell it quickly, other investors choose to hold onto their property for a longer period of time to realize a greater return on their investment. Real estate experts Scott Frank and Andy Heller have developed a proven and diversified program for real estate investing that incorporates both approaches and enables investors to take control of their financial futures and build wealth over time. Their new book, Buy Low, Rent Smart, Sell High: Real Estate Investing for the Long Run outlines a win-win-win program, one where average people can reap significant financial rewards by investing in real estate. * Win One: Buying Low - The investors first win occurs by purchasing real estate at a 10-20 percent discount by seeking out motivated buyers and avoiding paying agent commissions. The book reveals the secret to buying foreclosed homes with clean titles from banks and mortgage companies. * Win Two: Renting Smart - The property is rented through a lease/purchase agreement. Not only does the investor get a down payment from the lease/purchasee, but he or she also receives monthly rent that usually exceeds the monthly mortgage payment. Also, the lease/purchasee takes on the maintenance and repair responsibilities and tends to be a better tenant in return for their special lease/purchase terms. In addition, as the owner of the property, the investor is able to receive tax write-offs. * Win Three: Selling High - The final win results when the lease/purchasee exercises his or her right to purchase the property. The owner has realized the benefits of owning the property and has sold it to the lease/purchasee without agent commissions. If the lease/purchasee decides not to exercise his or right, the investor still wins because he or she can either extend the lease purchase agreement and increase the purchase price (based on property appreciation) or enter into another lease/purchase agreement with a new tenant and begin the cycle of wins all over.",

Why were so many of them turning to therapy in the first place? Why had these lovely and promising human beings fallen prey to depression, eating disorders, suicide attempts, and crushingly low self-esteem? The answer hit a nerve with Pipher, with parents, and with the girls themselves. Crashing and burning in a \u201cdevelopmental Bermuda Triangle,\u201d they were coming of age in a media-saturated culture preoccupied with unrealistic ideals of beauty and images of dehumanized sex, a culture rife with addictions and sexually transmitted diseases. They were losing their resiliency and optimism in a \u201cgirl-poisoning\u201d culture that propagated values at odds with those necessary to survive.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Told in the brave, fearless, and honest voices of the girls themselves who are emerging from the chaos of adolescence, Reviving Ophelia is a call to arms, offering important tactics, empathy, and strength, and urging a change where young hearts can flourish again, and rediscover and reengage their sense of self.",

In the meantime there are only questions: Why did this happen? Why her? What about her art? What about her life? In this striking first novel, Kelly Bingham uses poems, letters, telephone conversations, and newspaper clippings to look unflinchingly at what it\u2019s like to lose part of yourself - and to summon the courage it takes to find yourself again.",

But something is sadly familiar here, perhaps because we have been taught to anticipate a world in which people suddenly fly off the planet. It might be The Rapture. Or it might be some violation of the force of gravity. Whatever it is, it\u2019s spreading madness, religious hysteria, and some truly formidable government powers.The voice of these Lamentations is a sixty-something, club-footed scientist named Julius Marantz, an obsessive researcher who suffers both from forbidden knowledge and an insistent conscience. As his spirit and his heart begin to fail, Julius realizes what is lost to him: a childhood of possibility, the consolation of belief, and the undying optimism of a father who taught him the principles of physics on the roller-coaster and the parachute jump.Partly a portrait of cynical politics and religious fervor, part scientific speculation and even a meditation on the glories of Coney Island, The Lamentations of Julius Marantz traces the rise and fall of science in a truly personal story that finally fairly ascends.",

        "Authors": "By Conyers., John, Jr. (FRW), Bleifuss, Joel, and Freeman, Steven F.",
        "Description": "On the afternoon of Election Day 2004, the world was abuzz with the news: Exit polls indicated that John Kerry would win the election and become the next president of the United States. That proved not to be the case.According to the official count\u2014that is the number of votes tallied, not necessarily the number of votes cast\u2014George W. Bush beat Kerry by a margin of three million votes. The exit polls however had predicted a margin of victory for Kerry of five million votes. In every \u201cbattleground\u201d state across the nation the final tally swung clearly beyond the exit poll\u2019s margin of error to favor the president.How can one explain this eight-million-vote discrepancy between the Election Day exit polls and the official count? Either the exit poll data was wrong or the official count was wrong.Was the 2004 Presidential Election Stolen? analyzes the exit poll data and looks at documented examples of conventional vote suppression and outright vote fraud. It investigates the possibility that enough election fraud occurred to determine the outcome of the presidential race. And it asks the question why neither the government, nor the Democratic Party, nor any major media organization did their own investigation.Steve Freeman has a PhD in organization studies from MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management. He is a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Organizational Dynamics, where he teaches research methods and survey design (a domain that includes polling). He has received four national awards for best research paper of the year\u2014on four different topics in three different fields.Joel Bleifuss, a journalist of 23 years, is the editor of In These Times. In his 18 years there, he has had more articles cited as one of the Top Censored Stories of the Year by Project Censored than any other journalist.",

In this provocative work, Mander challenges the utopian promise of technological society and tracks its devastating impact on native cultures worldwide. The Western world\u2019s loss of a sense of the sacred in the natural world, he says, has led us toward global environmental disaster and social disorder?and worse lies ahead. Yet models for restoring our relationship with the Earth exist in the cultures of native peoples, whose values and skills have enabled them to survive centuries of invasion and exploitation.Far from creating paradise on Earth, technology has instead produced an unsustainable contest for resources. Mander surveys the major technologies shaping the ?new world order\u201d?computers, telecommunications, space exploration, genetic engineering, robotics, and the corporation itself?and warns that they are merging into a global mega-technology, with dire environmental and political results.",

We'd just toss out our birth control pills and before we knew it, we'd be rocking our little one to sleep.

Sound familiar?If your idea of foreplay is screaming, \"I'm ovulating; it's time!!!\" to your oblivious husband...If your ovulation schedule is ruling your life and every trip to the drug store includes a bulk purchase of pregnancy sticks...If you're running out of answers to the chronic questioning from the pregnancy paparazzi about your plans for parenthood ...Then this is the book for you. Whether it's been three months or three years since you've been trying, the more complicated and overwhelming the process becomes.The Conception Chronicles shares candid humor, hold-nothing-back banter and practical advice on everything that goes along with trying to start a family: from dealing with your fertile friends to the battery of tests you may have to face; from surviving \"sex on demand\" to navigating the ins and outs of high-tech fertility treatments. This book will guide you through the emotional journey to motherhood, offering compassion and laughter like only your best girlfriends can. And we promise you'll never hear us say, \"Relax and you'll be pregnant in no time.\"",

Verghese brought a singular perspective to Johnson City: as a doctor unique in his abilities; as an outsider who could talk to people suspicious of local practitioners; above all, as a writer of grace and compassion who saw that what was happening in this conservative community was both a medical and a spiritual emergency.",

        "Description": "When the first Superman movie came out I was frequently asked 'What is a hero?'\u00a0\u00a0I remember the glib response I repeated so many times.\u00a0\u00a0My answer was that a hero is someone who commits a courageous action without considering the consequences--a soldier who crawls out of a foxhole to drag an injured buddy to safety.\u00a0\u00a0And I also meant individuals who are slightly larger than life: Houdini and Lindbergh, John Wayne, JFK, and Joe DiMaggio.\u00a0\u00a0Now my definition is completely different.\u00a0\u00a0I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles: a fifteen-year-old boy who landed on his head while wrestling with his brother, leaving him barely able to swallow or speak; Travis Roy, paralyzed in the first thirty seconds of a hockey game in his freshman year at college.\u00a0\u00a0These are real heroes, and so are the families and friends who have stood by them.\"The whole world held its breath when Christopher Reeve struggled for life on Memorial Day, 1995.\u00a0\u00a0On the third jump of a riding competition, Reeve was thrown headfirst from his horse in an accident that broke his neck and left him unable to move or breathe.In the years since then, Reeve has not only survived, but has fought for himself, for his family, and for the hundreds of thousands of people with spinal cord injuries in the United States and around the world.\u00a0\u00a0And he has written Still Me, the heartbreaking, funny, courageous, and hopeful story of his life.Chris describes his early success on Broadway opposite the legendary Katherine Hepburn, the adventure of filming Superman on the streets of New York, and how the movie made him a star.\u00a0\u00a0He continued to move regularly between film acting and theater work in New York, Los Angeles, and at the WIlliamstown Theatre Festival in the Berkshires.\u00a0\u00a0Reunited with his Bostonians director, James Ivory, in 1992, he traveled to England to work with Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins in The Remains of the Day.The Man who cannot move has not stopped moving.\u00a0\u00a0He has established a charitable foundation to raise awareness and money for research on spinal cord injuries.\u00a0\u00a0His work as director of the HBO film In the Gloaming earned him an Emmy nomination, one of five that the film received.\u00a0\u00a0His speeches at the Democratic National Convention and the Academy Awards inspired people around the country and the world.\u00a0\u00a0He has testified before Congress on behalf of health insurance legislation, lobbied for increased federal funding for spinal cord research, and developed a working relationship with President Clinton.With dignity and sensitivity, he describes the journey he has made--physically, emotionally, spiritually.\u00a0\u00a0He explores his complex relationship with his parents, his efforts to remain a devoted husband and father, and his continuing and heroic battle to rebuild his life.This is the determined, passionate story of one man, a gifted actor and star, and how he and his family came to grips with the kind of devastating, unexplainable shock that fate can bring to any of us.\u00a0\u00a0Chris and Dana Reeve have gathered the will and the spirit to create a new life, one responsive and engaged and focused on the future.",
