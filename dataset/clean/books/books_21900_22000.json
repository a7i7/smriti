Feeling a need for roots, she buys her ancestral home, a restored Victorian house in the historic New Jersey seaside resort town of Spring Lake. Her family had sold the house in 1892, after one of Emily's forebears, Madeline Shapley, then still a young girl, disappeared.  Now, more than a century later, as the house is being renovated and the backyard excavated for a pool, the skeleton of a young woman is found. She is identified as Martha Lawrence, who had disappeared from Spring Lake over four year ago. Within her skeletal hand is the finger bone of another woman with a ring still on it -- a Shapley family heirloom.  In seeking to find the link between her family's past and the recent murder, Emily becomes a threat to a devious and seductive killer, who has chosen her as the next victim.",

        "Title": "The Fire of His Genius: Robert Fulton and the American Dream",
        "Authors": "By Sale, Kirkpatrick",
        "Description": "None of the well-dressed crowd that gathered on the Hudson River side of Lower Manhattan on the hot afternoon of August 17, 1808, could have known the importance of the object they had come to see and, mostly, deride: Robert Fulton's new steamboat, the North River, the boat that is frequently -- and wrongly -- remembered as the Clermont. But, as Kirkpatrick Sale shows in this remarkable biography of Fulton, the North River's successful four-day round-trip to Albany proved a technology that would transform nineteenth-century America, open up the interior to huge waves of settlers, create and sustain industrial and plantation economies in the nation's heartland, and destroy the remaining Indian civilizations and most of the wild lands on which they depended. The North River's four-day trip introduced the machines and culture that marked the birth of the Industrial Revolution in America.  The Fire of His Genius tells the story of the extraordinarily driven and ambitious inventor who brought all this about, probing into the undoubted genius of his mind but, too, laying bare the darker side of the man -- and the darker side of the American dream that inspired him. It depicts one of America's earliest heroes both at the pinnacle of creativity and success, fame, and fortune and in the depths of solitude, recklessness, and contentiousness that preceded his early death (Fulton spent much of his life defending patents for everything from rope-making machinery to submarines to proto-torpedoes that he attempted to sell, in succession, to the French, the British, and the American navies). All this is set against a brilliant portrait of a dynamic historical period filled with characters from Bonaparte to Jefferson, Cornelius Vanderbilt to Meriwether Lewis, Robert Livingston to Benjamin West, and events from the Lewis and Clark expedition to the War of 1812, the Louisiana Purchase to the bombing of Fort McHenry, the treasontrial of Aaron Burr to the \"Great Removal\" of American Indians. Here are the \"taming\" of America's rivers and the building of its great canals, the introduction to every body of water of Fulton's \"large, noisy, showy, fast, brash, exciting, powerful, and audacious\" machine that was the very embodiment of America. A biography that bears comparison to the best work of David McCullough, Dava Sobel, and Garry Wills, The Fire of His Genius is a remarkable achievement: an extraordinarily clear window into an extraordinary time told with deftness, zest, and unflagging verve.",

But music has an even more astonishing power, one you may have suspected from your own experience, but which you will now learn well documented. Quite simply, music is good for you-physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Particular sounds, tones and rhythms, especially the music of Mozart, Gregorian chant, and some jazz, New Age, Latin, pop, and even rock music, can strengthen the mind, unlock the creative spirit, and, miraculously, even heal the body. This remarkable phenomenon is called The Mozart Effect.Stimulating, authoritative, and often lyrical, THE MOZART EFFECT offers dramatic accounts of how doctors, shamans, musicians, and health care professionals use music to deal with everything from anxiety to cancer, high blood pressure, chronic pain, dyslexia, even mental illness. Students who sing or play an instrument score up to 51 points higher on SAT than the national average. During strenuous exercise, the upbeat music of Diana Ross can lessen fatigue and release endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. The director of a Baltimore hospital's coronary care unit says that half an hour of classical music produces the same effect as ten milligrams of Valium. And now, whatever your listening taste, Don Campbell explains how to make the Mozart Effect work for you.",

Neither parents nor children need to take potty training too seriously, because sooner or later, everything works out just fine.

This immediate best-seller, based on Martha's experience as a professional caterer, introduced readers to a new style of entertaining and a new style of cookbook - one that was gloriously photographed and filled with a wealth of information on the art of hospitality.

More than 1,600 recipes and variations - all the recipes from Entertaining, Quick Cook, Pies & Tarts, Hors d'Oeuvres, Quick Cook Menus, Gardening, Weddings, Christmas, and Menus for Entertaining - are gathered together in a single volume. Thoroughly revised and updated, The Martha Stewart Cookbook includes a new introduction by Martha, new step-by-step illustrations, new menus, and sidebars and tips on subjects as varied as freezing pastry, selecting the best fruit, and setting the table.",

        "Title": "Chasing Ghosts: A Soldier's Fight for America from Baghdad to Washington",
        "Authors": "By Rieckhoff, Paul",
        "Description": "The riveting, action-packed true story of the first soldier to challenge the war in Iraq.  As a 1st Lieutenant and Infantry Platoon Leader for the U.S. Army, charged with leading 38 young men in Iraq, Paul Rieckhoff was proud to follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, who served during Vietnam and WWII respectively. He and his soldiers spent almost a year in one of the most dangerous and volatile areas of Baghdad. And what they encountered there was chaos: not nearly enough troops, no humanitarian aid, no body armor, no radios, and no real plan for what to do after Baghdad fell.  Rieckhoff was shocked to see that sometimes the greatest challenges his platoon faced did not come from enemy combatants. He saw fi rsthand the disastrous results of disbanding the Iraqi army, sending thousands of armed, angry, and unemployed men out into the streets. And he saw what happened when we tried to conduct a war on the cheap, by bestowing government contracts to the lowest bidder and sending our military into battle inadequately protected and armed. What followed, over the next ten months, set him on a course that would forever change his life.  When he fi nally came home from his tour of duty, Rieckhoff vowed to tell Americans the truth about what was going on in Iraq. He demanded accountability from elected officials and was the first Iraq veteran to do so publicly. He created Operation Truth, the first and largest veterans' group specifically for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Through this organization, he has become a leading spokesman for troops, veterans, and their families, and a critical voice in the ongoing debate surrounding this conflict.  What is really happening in Iraq? Should we be there? Should we stay? Rieckhoff is in a unique position to answer these crucial questions. Not only was he on the ground in the heat of battle but he is also on the front lines politically at home. He provides a grunt's-eye view of the harrowing, bloody battles on the streets of Baghdad and a patriot's vision of where America has gone wrong and how it can reset its path.",

        "Description": "Israel\u2019s Mossad is thought by many to be one of the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world. In Man in the Shadows, Efraim Halevy\u2014a Mossad officer since 1961 and its chief between 1998 and 2002\u2014provides an unprecedented portrait of the Middle East crisis. Having served as the secret envoy of prime ministers Rabin, Shamir, Netanyahu, Barak, and Sharon, Halevy was privy to many of the top-level negotiations that determined the progress of the region\u2019s struggle for peace during the years when the threat of Islamic terror became increasingly powerful. Informed by his extraordinary access, he writes candidly about the workings of the Mossad, the prime ministers he served under, and the other major players on the international stage: Yasir Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Hafiz al-Assad, Mu\u2019amar Gadhafi, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. From the vantage point of a chief in charge of a large organization, he frankly describes the difficulty of running an intelligence agency in a time when heads of state are immersed, as never before, in using intelligence to protect their nations while, at the same time, acting to protect themselves politically. Most important, he writes fiercely and without hesitation about how the world might achieve peace in the face of the growing threat from Islamic terrorist organizations. In this gripping inside look, Halevy opens his private dossier on events past and present: the assassination attempt by the Mossad on the life of Khaled Mashal, now the leader of Khammas; the negotiations surrounding the Israeli-Jordan Peace Accord and its importance for the stability of the region; figures in the CIA, like Jim Angleton and George Tenet, with whom he worked (Halevy even shares his feelings about Tenet\u2019s abrupt resignation). He tells the truth about what the Mossad really knew before 9/11. He writes candidly about assessing the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the region and beyond, and what this spells for the future of international stability and survival. He touches on the increasing visibility of the CIA in the Middle East and openly shares his misgivings about both the report of the 9/11 Commission and the Middle East road map to peace that was pressed on all sides of the conflict by the U.S. government. He looks at the terrorist attacks in Madrid and London and their far-reaching effects, and states the unthinkable: We have yet to see the worst of what the radical Islamic terrorists are capable of. Sure to be one of the year\u2019s most talked-about books, this fierce and intelligent account of will be a must-read for those looking to hear from a man who wielded his influence, in the shadows, to save the Middle East and the world from a never-ending cycle of violence and destruction.",

        "Description": "Countess Elizabeth Bathory of Hungary (1560-1613) was beautiful, well educated in the best traditions of the Renaissance, and wealthy beyond measure.Upon assuming her seat of power at the age of sixteen, the Countess set out upon a course of revelry and debauchery, aided by her spiritual adviser, Darvulia, and by her faithful bevy of overwrought maids. Eventually, time and an excess of increasingly bizarre pleasures led the Countess to fear the loss of her beauty. She was advised by her witches to take baths in the blood of virgins to regenerate her body. A long procession of young girls were \"chosen\" to spend the night with Elizabeth. Six hundred and fifty young women are said to have died in the Countess's castles.Countess Elizabeth Bathory's direct descendant, Drake Bathory-Kereshtur, is a Hungarian emigre living in New York near the end of the twentieth century. He considers himself a failure at life. His relationships with women have been disasters. He is haunted by the Hungary of his youth, which he had to flee during the Hungarian revolution of 1956. After the collapse of Communism, he returned to Hungary to find his youth, but found instead something a lot more horrifying: the pervasive presence of his ancestor, Countess Bathory. When he returns to the United States, he confesses to a hideous crime before a New York magistrate. This exquisite novel is told through Drake's eyes, as he searches for his roots and comes to terms with this gruesome part of his family history.",

Then one wintry night, Rom finds a corpse at the mouth of his cave that rouses his well-defined sense of ethics and launches him on an obsessive quest for answers. Forced to reconnect with society, Rom leaves his world and journeys through a spiraling web of clues and hunches, straight into a sinister den of money, temptation, and murder--otherwise known as the \"civilized\" world.",

A veteran of some of the war's bloodiest fighting, he tells the story of a gallant band of young Marines coming of age in a crucible of fire, lead, and steel.For Privates Moe, Cole, Cannon, and the other riflemen of the 3d Squad, 3d Platoon, Dog Company, the war was not all killing or being killed. While camped on islands far from the focus of battle, these free spirits hatched many a plan to foil the officers struggling to rein them in. Their hilarious misadventures provide a dramatic contrast to the sobering accounts of close-quarters combat.",

        "Authors": "By Ambrose, Stephen E. and Immerman, Richard H.",
        "Description": "Dwight D. Eisenhower's public image was that of a wide-grinning Daddy Warbucks who preferred the golf course over the cabinet room. He was perceived as a military bureaucrat who never held a combat command. A Republican sandwiched between two Democratic administrations, he lacked the political vigor of his predecessor Harry S. Truman and the star quality of his successor JFK. Yet behind the placid image he was a sly fox who ran the most efficient espionage establishment in the world. His goal was to keep the Free World free. To do so, he fostered the growth of the CIA, overthrew governments, flew spy flights, and hatched assassination plots. At the top of the intelligence pyramid, Ike shouldered some of the greatest coups in espionage history, as well as some of its most ignominious failures. Among Ike's successes: The \"Man Who Never Was\" strategem, the ULTRA-guided ambush of the German counterattack at Mortain, which opened the Allies' way to the Rhine, the 1954 overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz Guzman's government of Guatemala, Operation AJAX, which toppled Iran's Mossadegh, and the U-2 flights over Russia. But Ike can be credited likewise for miscalculations: the failure to predict the German attack during the Battle of the Bulge, the Francis Gary Powers fiasco, and the tragic and irresponsible encouragement of freedom fighters in Hungary, Indonesia, and Cuba. In writing this revealing probe into the 1950s spy world, Stephen E. Ambrose, the author of the most acclaimed full-scale biography of Eisenhower, interviewed the president and many of his agents and had access to much previously unpublished archival material. \"The story he tells,\" said the New York Review of Books in 1981 when the book was first published, \"is one of some very low deeds done in the name of high moral principles.\" Stephen E. Ambrose was Director Emeritus of the Eisenhower Center, Boyd Professor of History at the University of New Orleans, and president of the National D- Day Museum. He was the author of many books, most recently The Mississippi and the Making of a Nation: From the Louisana Purchase to Today. His compilation of 1,400 oral histories from American veterans and authorship of over 20 books established him as one of the foremost historians of the Second World War in Europe. He died October 13, 2002, in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.",

Complicating the natural mourning process is the fact that this loss often occurs in our thirties, forties, or fifties--as we are raising our own children, watching them leave the nest, and facing other adjustments in our lives, from our jobs to our marriages to our health. This thoughtful exploration of a neglected subject explains the emotional impact of losing our parents in the midst of midlife--and why many underestimate it. Discussing such topics as changes in self-image, unresolved issues, guilt, sorrow, and anger, the emotional impact of inheritance, and the shifting of roles as a result of \"midlife orphanhood,\"Jane Brooks shows us how to find new sources of strength, in both ourselves and others, after our parents are gone.",

Their only escape from the grim streets of Chicago's West Side is onto the neighborhood courts, where they and their friends dream of playing in the NBA. For most it's just a forlorn hope, but Arthur and William are different: barely out of grade school, they already display the raw potential that just might make their dreams come true.Hoop Dreams began as a documentary film that tracked these two young men for almost five years as they struggled to turn their playground skills into the kind of basketball mastery that could earn them college scholarships - and maybe even a place in the pros. Critics from coast to coast hailed the film as one of the finest documentaries ever made, both a superb portrait of two gifted teenagers working their way through the tough, often cruel basketball machine, and a searing look at the harsh realities of inner-city life.In this remarkable book, award-winning journalist Ben Joravsky chronicles Arthur and William's battle to reach the top and tells the story that could not be told on film. His vivid prose evokes the experience of being plucked from the projects and offered a glittering future. He captures not only the moments of basketball glory at suburban St. Joseph High School, which produced superstar Isiah Thomas, but also the loneliness of being poor and black in an affluent, mostly white school and the overwhelming pressure to perform both on the court and in the classroom.",
