        "Title": "State of the Unions: How Labor Can Strengthen the Middle Class, Improve Our Economy, and Regain Political Influence",
        "Authors": "By Dine, Philip M.",
        "Description": "From steel workers, Teamsters, and coal miners to teachers, actors, and civil servants, union members once accounted for more than one third of the American workforce. At a mere 12 percent, union membership today is a shadow of what it once was. What happened to organized labor in America and what can be done to restore it to its role of the defender of middle-class values and economic well-being?Award-winning investigative reporter Philip M. Dine takes us on a riveting journey through America's cities and back roads, its factories and union halls, to answer those questions. From the health care crisis to massive job flight overseas, from rampant home foreclosures to illegal immigration, he clearly shows how virtually every major economic, political, and social trend impacting our way of life is tied to the state of America's unions.Combining a compelling narrative with expert analysis, Dine offers firsthand accounts of the union members striving to make their voices heard in a political landscape increasingly shaped by corporate interests, including how:The women of Delta Pride-a major player in the multi-billion dollar catfish industry-went up against generations of racial and economic prejudiceIowa's firefighters union flexed its collective muscle to score a major political victory in the 2004 caucusThe American Federation of Teachers and the AFL-CIO played a key role in bringing down the Iron CurtainThe Teamsters enlisted community support to temporarily stop a move by Mr. Coffee to relocate to Mexico and saved nearly 400 manufacturing jobs in the Cleveland areaA reporter who has covered labor for two decades, Dine not only details where labor has gone wrong, but he also offers sage advice on how it can adapt to a global economy to recover the ground it lost over the last quarter century.",

Set in 1990s London, the plot centers on a treasure lost in the Blitz and newly discovered by an unscrupulous lawyer, who is tempted by greed into a series of crimes leading to murder. \"The true treasure here is Stevenson's motley chorus of characters\" (The New Yorker); the main character is London itself, lovingly depicted in all its rich variousness. With elegant wit, keen social observation, and dazzling intelligence, Stevenson explores the ways that people's lives intertwine in a great city, often with startling results.",

When her uncle Eric is murdered, Jayn\u00e9 travels to Denver to settle his estate, only to learn that it's all hers -- and vaster than she ever imagined. And along with properties across the world and an inexhaustible fortune, Eric left her a legacy of a different kind: his unfinished business with a cabal of wizards known as the Invisible College.

Like its predecessor, the popular Baby 411, the book provides practical advice in a handy question-and-answer format that allows frantic parents to find information fast. Pediatrician Ari Brown and coauthor Denise Fields, both mothers, tackle toddlerhood with a reassuring, \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d attitude that puts parents\u2019 minds at ease. Parents learn how to cope with a picky eater; raise a well-behaved child; potty train in just one day; what to look for in a preschool; what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s not, and what to do about it. Covering all aspects of a young child\u2019s development, both physical and emotional, Toddler 411 offers the up-to-date, evidence-based guidance that today\u2019s parents demand and deserve.",
