        "Title": "The Grand Idea: George Washington's Potomac and the Race to the West",
        "Authors": "By Achenbach, Joel",
        "Description": "The war had been won. Now what? This was the pressing political question for the United States in 1784, and a consuming one for George Washington. He had laid down his sword and returned home to Mount Vernon after eight and a half years as commander of the Continental Army. He vowed that he had retired forever, that he would be a farmer on the bank of the Potomac River, under his own \"vine and fig tree.\" But history was not done with him, and he was not done with history.   Within a year, as Joel Achenbach relates in this stunning narrative, Washington saddled up and rode away on one of the most daring journeys of his rich and adventurous life: a trek across the Appalachian mountains to the frontier, where he would inspect his long-neglected western property and try to collect rent.  The Grand Idea is the story of Washington's ambitions for the brand-new republic that he had fought so hard to create. His western journey culminates in a breathtaking scheme: Washington, with the help of Thomas Jefferson, will transform the Potomac River into a commercial artery that will link the new West to the old East. Worried that the newborn country was so fragmented that it might literally split into two separate and rival nations, he uses the skills he learned as a young backwoods surveyor to come up with his river plan. The future of the Union, Washington believes, depends on the Potomac route to the West, which will bind the country to one enterprise.  Achenbach's sympathetic and wry portrait of General Washington is not the stiff figure of official portraits, but that of a bold man who plunges into uncharted forest and sleeps in a downpour with only his cloak for shelter. He is an inventor, entrepreneur, and land speculator. He loves the West. This Washington is someone who understands that the fledgling republic clinging to the Atlantic seaboard will become a great and booming nation.  Achenbach tracks Washington's river plan from the choosing of the site for the national capital, which led to his being elected as the first president, to its link, decades after his death, to various grandiose plans for a canal that would run hundreds of miles. Ultimately the dream of a Potomac route to the West is abandoned. The nation splits not East and West but North and South, and the river becomes a boundary between warring sides in the Civil War.  Like such classics as Undaunted Courage and Founding Brothers, Achenbach's The Grand Idea is a large narrative of a great man and his grand plan that captures the uncertainties and conflicts of the new country, the passions of an ambitious people, and the seemingly endless beauty of the American landscape.",

The experience of combat and his easy dominance of home-state politics have made Charlie fearless. He's a hot, if occasionally reckless, political property - dashing, honorable, and irreverent.And then Charlie's life begins to fall apart. He campaigns for the presidency and fails. The wacky father of a volunteer decks him - in front of the cameras; a well-kept secret from Charlie's Vietnam days is revealed; he reluctantly finds himself at the center of a friend's cliff-hanging confirmation process for Secretary of Defense ... And Senator Martin begins to learn that politics in an era of spin, marketing, and vicious personal assaults can be as treacherous - and life-threatening - as combat was.Finally, Charlie Martin must confront the two greatest challenges of his life - a political opponent who has no scruples and a dazzling, unconventional woman who loves him but is appalled by his life's work. Charlie's dilemma is one that has come to haunt contemporary American politics: Is it possible to be a good politician and a good man, can you live in the public glare and still construct a habitable life?",

'What ex-professional football player, known for a squeaky clean image, got caught in bed with a sexy woman and claimed it was all a set up? Who started the rumor about Mamie Eisenhower's drinking problems? About Richard Gere's interesting sexual partners? Did you know George Bush and Bob Dole had mistresses?Some of these things are true -- others are just rumors -- but all of them were gossiped about, and they are just a delicious sampling of the unforgettable tidbits offered up in the bewitching Scorpion Tongues.Gail Collins has pulled together an immensely appealing, bag-o'- popcorn book, with one intriguing piece of rumor and innuendo following another in a veritable parade of peccadillos and misdeeds. But Collins also explores the more serious effects of gossip, noting that it can be as unpredictable as a summer tornado, flattening one person's reputation while passing over another's with hardly a rustle. Compare, for example, Gary Hart's career-ending \"Monkey Business\" trip with JFK's conquest of a stewardess, which he confessed to by flippantly saying, \"I got into the blonde.\" 'With anecdotes and illustrations from politics, movies, television, culture, and sports, Scorpion Tongues offers sinful scandals and mild hearsay for every taste.",

Heather's ballet interpretation of Sandi Patty's \"Via Dolorosa\" drew repeated ovations from her spellbound audience as she danced to music she could not hear. That night, Heather became the 75th Anniversary Miss America, the first physically challenged Miss America in the pageant's history - and eventually, one of the most popular Miss Americas ever.But Heather's dramatic story really began twenty years earlier. At eighteen months, Heather fell victim to a deadly illness that left her with a devastating hearing loss. In those dark days, her parents were faced with the first of many hard choices they would have to make about Heather's health, hearing, and education - choices that would dramatically affect their daughter's life.In this moving story, Heather's mother, Daphne Gray, recounts those agonizing choices. Refusing to leave her daughter in a silent world, Daphne enrolled her in ballet class. She researched the educational options for her daughter, making the controversial choice to emphasize speech rather than sign language. And she never, ever stopped believing that Heather could one day thrive in a hearing person's world.",

The ghost of the Sea-born Woman is said to give aid to sailors around Portsmouth Island even today. Roberta \"Bert\" Lenehan is a latter-day sea-born woman who comes to the island as a National Park Service volunteer. Bert is between jobs and lovers, and she believes that a three-month stint as caretaker of Portsmouth village\u2014a remote, pristine, picturesque ghost town\u2014is what she needs to soothe her soul. She soon learns differently. One of the previous caretakers died under mysterious circumstances, and another woman turns up dead on the island shortly after her arrival. From park ranger Hunter O'Hagan, she hears rumors of artifact hunters digging illegally on Portsmouth and learns the story of Hunter's distant ancestor Jerushia Spriggs O'Hagan, the original Sea-born Woman. Who is the killer stalking the island? And what bearing do a murdered pirate and centuries-old legend have on the crimes? Those are the questions Bert is pressured to answer as a hurricane bears down on the island and she finds herself the target of a killer.BJ Mountford comes from a merchant-marine family. She was born in San Francisco but was brought up on the coast of Chile, Venezuela, and Barbados. She attended college in Pennsylvania, where she met her husband at a nearby law school. After a 25-year career in real estate, BJ sold her office and tried her hand at writing. When she retired to Emerald Isle, North Carolina, she began volunteering with the National Park Service. She\u2019s worked at Portsmouth Island and Cape Lookout Keepers\u2019 Quarters on the Outer Banks.

        "Description": "No fabled creature of the Pleistocene Era has a more powerful hold on the imagination than the woolly mammoth. Cave paintings of the giant beasts hint at the profound role they played in early human culture: Our Ice Age ancestors built igloo-shaped huts out of mammoth bones, sewed their clothing with mammoth hair, even feasted on mammoth tongues.Eager to uncover more clues to this vanished prehistoric age, explorers since the time of Peter the Great have scoured Siberia for mammoth remains. Now a new generation of explorers has taken to the tundra. Armed with GPS, ground-penetrating radar, and Soviet-era military helicopters, they seek an elusive prize: a mammoth carcass that will help determine how the creature lived, how it died - and how it might be brought back to life.In this adventure-filled narrative, science writer Richard Stone follows two groups of explorers - one a Russian-Japanese team, the other a French-led consortium - as they battle bitter cold, high winds, and supply shortages to carry out their quest. This daring band of 21st century mammoth hunters includes the eccentric French explorer, Bernard Buigues, whose Arctic tourism company flies wealthy travelers to the North Pole and whose partner, Christian de Marliave, once retraced Shackleton's journey across South Georgia Island; the quirky Japanese scientist, Kazufumi Goto, who is determined to clone a mammoth, and the Dutch customs official, Dick Mol, an amateur fossilist who is dead set against cloning. Each of these explorers must gain the trust of the indigenous Siberians, many of whom fear the consequences of awakening the \"rat beneath the ice.\"",

Murderers, rapists, and armed robbers were competing in the annual rodeo at Angola, the grim maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana.The incongruity of seeing hope where one would expect only hopelessness, self-control in men who were there because they'd had none, sparked an urgent quest in him. Having gained unlimited and unmonitored access, Bergner spent an unflinching year inside the harsh world of Angola. He forged relationships with seven prisoners who left an indelible impression on him.Looming front and center is Warden Burl Cain, the larger-than-life ruler of Angola who quotes both Jesus and Attila the Hun, declares himself a prophet, and declaims that redemption is possible for even the most depraved criminal. Cain welcomes Bergner in, and so begins a journey that takes the author deep into a forgotten world and forces him to question his most closely held beliefs. The climax of his story is as unexpected as it is wrenching.",

Now thirty, DeFoe works with Edward as a guard in Halifax's three-room Glace Museum. By day, he and his uncle break the silence of the museum with heated conversations that show them to be \"opposites at life.\" By night, DeFoe spends his time trying to keep the affection of Imogen Linny, the young caretaker of the small Jewish cemetery. Their relationship is a most provocative example of unrequited love. When the Dutch painting Jewess on a Street in Amsterdam arrives at the museum, Imogen becomes obsessed and abandons her life in favor of the ennobled one she imagines for its subject - even though being a Jew in Amsterdam is becoming more and more perilous as the clouds of World War II begin to gather.As the true story of the Jewess emerges, Imogen leaves DeFoe and enters the orbit of Edward and his own fascination with the horrific news being broadcast from Europe. Drawing together the mysteries of identity and self-determination and the ominous aura of the late 1930s, The Museum Guard is an examination of the desire to step out of the everyday and into action - and of that desire's often tragic consequences.",

The decisive importance of these five days is the focus of John Lukacs\u2019s magisterial new book.Lukacs takes us hour by hour into the critical unfolding of events at 10 Downing Street, where Churchill and the members of his cabinet were painfully considering their war responsibilities. We see how the military disasters taking place on the Continent\u2014particularly the plight of the nearly 400,000 British soldiers bottled up in Dunkirk\u2014affected Churchill\u2019s fragile political situation, for he had been prime minister only a fortnight and was regarded as impetuous and hotheaded even by many of his own party. Lukacs also investigates the mood of the British people, drawing on newspaper and Mass-Observation reports that show how the citizenry, though only partly informed about the dangers that faced them, nevertheless began to support Churchill\u2019s determination to stand fast.Other historians have dealt with Churchill\u2019s difficulties during this period, using the partial revelations of certain memoirs and private and public papers. But Lukacs is the first to convey the drama and importance of these days, and he does so in a compelling narrative that combines deep knowledge with high literary style.",

        "Authors": "By Chapman, Matthew",
        "Description": "\"When Darwin called his second book The Descent of Man instead of The Ascent of Man he was thinking of his progeny.\" So declares Darwin's great-great grandson Matthew Chapman as he leaves behind his stressful career as a Hollywood screenwriter and travels to Dayton, Tennessee where in 1925 creationist opposition to the teaching of evolution in schools was played out in a famous legal drama, the Scopes Monkey Trial.The purpose of this journey is to see if opinions have changed in the seventy- five intervening years. A defiant atheist, Chapman is confronted not only by the fundamentalist beliefs that continue to banish the theory of evolution but by his own spiritual malaise as the outward journey becomes an inward quest, a tragicomic \"accidental memoir\".\"First there was Charles Darwin, two yards long and nobody's fool. Then there was his son, my great-grandfather, Sir Francis Darwin, an eminent botanist. Then came my grandmother Frances, a modest poet who spent a considerable amount of time in rest-homes for depression From her issued my beloved mother, Clare, who was extremely short, failed to complete medical school, and eventually became an alcoholic. Then we get down to me. I'm in the movie business.\"Trials of the Monkey combines travel writing and reportage, as Chapman records his encounters in the South, with history and the accidental memoir of a man full of mid-life doubts in a genre-breaking first book that is darkly funny, provocative and poignant.",

In the intervening sixteen years much has changed--the Cold War is over, nuclear arms production has decreased, and there has been a marked growth in environmental awareness. But the nuclear genie has not been forced back into the bottle. The disaster at Chernobyl and the \"incidents\" at other plants around the world have disproven the image of \"safe\" nuclear power. Nuclear waste dumping has further poisoned our environment, and developing nuclear technology in the Third World poses still further risks.In this completely revised, updated, and expanded edition, Dr. Caldicott defines for the 1990s the dangers of this madness--including the insidious influence of the nuclear power industry and the American government's complicity in medical \"experiments\" using nuclear material--and calls on us to accept the moral challenge to fight against it, both for our own sake and for that of future generations.",

And so in New York a few weeks later, a sometimes writer, sometime thief named Nick Tosches gets a phone call from a friend. There's an item he wants him to look at, a manuscript that needs authentication. Tosches recognizes the pages for what they are - and embarks on the most harrowing adventure of his life.As this story unfolds, so too does a parallel tale: the odyssey, seven hundred years ago, of Dante himself, a man trying to weave out of the grossness of his own humanity a poem that contains the sum of the world's wisdom and the very breath of the divine. It is a struggle every bit as deadly as, centuries later, that between the individuals fighting to possess his manuscript.",

This is a war for dominance in the global marketplace, a war for economic supremacy.The United States is losing this war. Year after year, tens of billions of dollars flow from American bank accounts to Japanese pockets - the stark meaning of the oft-cited \"merchandise trade deficit\" - half a trillion dollars worth in the last decade. The United States is not losing because the Japanese are devious, or mercenary, or \"unfair traders.\" We are losing because of our own greed, myopia, and arrogance.The Keys to the Kingdom, a masterful account of bureaucratic ineptitude, political bloodshed, high-level intrigue, and sometimes breathtaking stupidity, chronicles the first major battle in this war. Aerospace and aviation products are America's most lucrative exports, bringing in billions of dollars and providing millions of high-wage jobs. The Japanese, having developed world-class auto, steel, and electronics industries (in the process devastating large segments of the American economy), make no secret of the fact that aviation and aerospace are their next targets.Despite these high stakes, the government of the United States, incredibly, agreed to give the Japanese some of the most sensitive, state-of-the-art aviation technology and design information America possesses - to build a plane called the FS-X.How this astonishing event transpired is the subject of The Keys to the Kingdom. Here is a tale of people at the front lines of the United States-Japan rivalry: the Japanese engineer who dreamed of re-creating the glory of the fabled Zero; the hard-nosed career bureaucrat whose fierce opposition to the FS-X deal set off internecine warfare in the American government; the mysterious Japanese lobbyist who seemed to have connections everywhere.Impeccably researched, brilliantly rendered, The Keys to the Kingdom boldly illuminates the themes that will dictate the fate of American power in the twenty-first century.",

        "Authors": "By Lohr, Steve",
        "Description": "In the 1950s, just before John Backus's team developed the Fortran language that revolutionized the first generation of programming, it took dozens of full-time programmers and operators to run and debug each of the era's room-sized computers. Today, languages like HTML are simple enough that anyone who knows it can set up a personal Web page, using a laptop that has many times the power of those early giant computers.In Go To, Steve Lohr chronicles the history of software from the early days of complex mathematical codes mastered by a few thousand to today's era of user-friendly software and over six million professional programmers worldwide. Lohr maps out the unique seductions of programming, and gives us an intimate portrait of the peculiar kind of genius that is drawn to this unique blend of art, science, and engineering. We meet the movers and shakers of every era from the 1950s to the open-source movement of today-iconoclasts such as Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, the Bell Labs engineers whose Unix operating system and C programming language loosened the grip of IBM; Charles Simonyi, the father of Word, the most popular software application; and James Gosling, the creative force behind Java, the leading programming language for the Internet.With original reporting and deft storytelling, Steve Lohr shows us how software transformed the world, and what it holds in store for our future. \"They took anyone who seemed to have an aptitude for problem-solving skills-bridge players, chess players, even women.\"-Lois Haibt, a member of IBM's original Fortran team\"It's like building something where you don't have to order the cement.\u2026 You can create a world of your own, your own environment, and never leave the room.\"-Ken Thompson, creator of the Unix operating system\"BASIC was an open city, Shanghai a hundred years ago. There were no laws.\"-Alan Cooper, the \"father\" of Visual Basic\"There is an odd and obsessive side to it. The people who are best at it are the kind of people who are intellectually drawn to something like it's magnetic, sucked into it, and they don't know why.\"-James Gosling, creator of the Java programming language\"Not being able to program is going to be like not being able to drive-lacking a fundamental skill in our society.\"-Brian Behlendorf, a leading figure in the open-source software movement",

As he moves on to Eleusis, Athens, and Crete, his playfulness and fondness for pranks matures into the courage to attempt singular heroic feats, the gallantry and leadership he was known for on the battlefield, and the bold-hearted ingenuity he shows in navigating the labyrinth and slaying the Minotaur. In what is perhaps the most inventive of all her novels of Ancient Greece, Renault casts Theseus in a surprisingly original pose; she teases the flawed human out of the bronze hero, and draws the plausible out of the fantastic.",
