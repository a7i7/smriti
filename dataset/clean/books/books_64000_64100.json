While there have always been those who cut corners, he shows that cheating on every level-from the highly publicized corporate scandals to Little League fraud-has risen dramatically in the last two decades. Why all the cheating? Why now?  Callahan pins the blame on the dog-eat-dog economic climate of the past two decades. An unfettered market and unprecedented economic inequality have corroded our values, he argues-and ultimately threaten the level playing field so central to American democracy itself. Through revealing interviews and extensive data, he takes us on a gripping tour of cheating in America and offers a powerful argument for why it matters. Lucidly written, scrupulously argued, The Cheating Culture is an important, original examination of the hidden costs of the boom years.",

Larson examines the many facets of the Scopes trial and shows how its enduring legacy has crossed religious, cultural, educational, and political lines.The \"Monkey Trial,\" as it was playfully nicknamed, was instigated by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a controversial Tennessee law banning the teaching of human evolution in public schools. The Tennessee statute represented the first major victory for an intense national campaign against Darwinism, launched in the 1920s by Protestant fundamentalists and led by the famed politician and orator William Jennings Bryan. At the behest of the ACLU, a teacher named John Scopes agreed to challenge the statute, and what resulted was a trial of mythic proportions. Bryan joined the prosecutors and acclaimed criminal attorney Clarence Darrow led the defense - a dramatic legal matchup that spurred enormous media attention and later inspired the classic play Inherit the Wind.The Scopes trial marked a watershed in our national discussion of science and religion. In addition to symbolizing the clash between evolutionists and creationists, the trial helped shape the development of both popular religion and constitutional law in America, serving as a precedent for more recent legal and political battles.",

This common sense approach puts the concept of evolution in the grasp of everyday Christians and reminds us that ultimately the key to our purpose in this life comes from understanding whose we are and who created us.",

        "Authors": "By Corcoran, Kevin and Fischer, Joel",
        "Description": "Today, as practitioners in all areas of the human services are increasingly held accountable for monitoring and evaluating their practices in an objective and efficient manner, a sound familiarity with objective measurement is more essential than ever before. In addition, practitioners must also be concerned with satisfying a dizzying array of state, agency, health maintenance organization, and insurance company guidelines.  For more than twelve years, through two highly acclaimed editions and now in an updated and expanded third edition, Kevin Corcoran and Joel Fischer's standard reference, Measures for Clinical Practice, has enabled professionals to gather this vital information easily and effectively. In Measures for Clinical Practice, Volume 1: Couples, Families, and Children, and Volume 2: Adults, Corcoran and Fischer provide an extensive collection of more than 400\"rapid assessment instruments\" (RAIs), including many questionnaires and scales, which assess virtually any problem commonly encountered in clinical practice. Corcoran and Fischer have revised this edition to reflect new research and contemporary clinical practices. They include new scales and materials in areas such as assessment in culturally diverse populations and measurement in managed care systems, as well as the best instruments updated from the previous editions.  Brief and easy to administer, these \"best practice measures\" will be useful for all types of therapeutic and theoretical orientations. All instruments are actually reprinted in the book, and are carefully introduced and evaluated to aid in their selection. Corcoran and Fischer explain the principles of measurement and how to apply them in practice. They explore the range of assessment techniques available, including behavioral observations, rating scales, and client logs, as well as unobtrusive, electromechanical, and standardized measures. And after examining the advantages and disadvantages of rapid assessment instruments, they show practitioners how to effectively select and administer these measures as part of the treatment process.  More comprehensive than ever, this edition of Measures for Clinical Practice is essential to every practitioner and student of social work, psychology, psychiatry, nursing, counseling, and the rehabilitative therapies.",

It\u2019s a chilling Christmas greeting for Boston medical examiner  Maura Isles and Detective Jane Rizzoli, who swiftly link the victim to controversial  celebrity psychiatrist Joyce O\u2019Donnell\u2013Jane\u2019s professional nemesis and member of  a sinister cabal called the Mephisto Club. On top of Beacon Hill, the club\u2019s acolytes  devote themselves to the analysis of evil: Can it be explained by science? Does it  have a physical presence? Do demons walk the earth? Drawing on a wealth of dark historical  data and mysterious religious symbolism, the Mephisto scholars aim to prove a startling  theory: that Satan himself exists among us.  With the grisly appearance of a corpse  on their doorstep, it\u2019s clear that someone\u2013or something\u2013is indeed prowling the city.  The members of the club begin to fear the very subject of their study. Could this  maniacal killer be one of their own\u2013or have they inadvertently summoned an evil entity  from the darkness?  Delving deep into the most baffling and unusual case of their  careers, Maura and Jane embark on a terrifying journey to the very heart of evil,  where they encounter a malevolent foe more dangerous than any they have ever faced  . . . one whose work is only just beginning.From the Hardcover edition.",

Though the novel is written as fiction, it is filled with all-too-real details provided by insiders in the oil industry, military, and Middle Eastern affairs that extrapolates real events from the past and present that will lead us down a path of self-destruction...unless we stop the insanity now!   The story opens in 2007 when two CIA spooks meet with an American Colonel in military intelligence. The war is going badly, and President Bush, who steadfastly refuses to back down, remains unchallenged at home as Democrats and Republicans continue to toss verbal grenades \u2013  positioning themselves for the 2008 elections. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear energy will yield enriched uranium within five years -- uranium that can be used to manufacture suitcase nukes. The United States\u2019 military is too drained to invade Iran, and a preemptive strike is out of the question...unless a nuclear detonation were to occur in an American city -- the enriched uranium traced back to Iran. A U.S. reprisal would strike a death-blow against radical Islam, quell the insurgent violence in Iraq...and yield more oil. Yes, the cost is unthinkable \u2013 but if we sit back and do nothing then one day a dozen suitcase bombs could go off in a dozen American cities \u2013 bringing with it anarchy and the collapse of Western civilization.December 2011: Ashley \u201cAce\u201d Futrell is an oil expert working for PetroConsultants, married to Kelli Doyle, a former National Security Advisor and one of the CIA spooks from the opening scene.
