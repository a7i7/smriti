Our guests who feel most comfortable here, and return year after year, are Gentiles.

As Natalie tries to enter the world that has excluded her\u2014and succeeds through the sheerest of accidents\u2014The Inn at Lake Devine becomes a delightful and provocative romantic comedy full of sparkling social mischief.",

With one insightful story after another, he reveals what goes on inside grade school and high school classrooms and inside big corporations and small companies in the three main capitalist economies; how that affects our future; and why today's greatest need is a new mind-set.In revealing portraits, Smith contrasts how American CEOs think at giants such as GM, Boeing, Motorola, compared to CEOs at Germany's Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Bank or at Japan's Toyota or Mitsubishi. He discloses how differently decisions are made and power is wielded in the corporate boardrooms of America, Germany, and Japan. He shows us what workers think and do in these rival economies and how the lives of workers at companies such as Ford and Motorola were transformed once management began rethinking its approach.Education is where the race begins. Smith contrasts what American grade school teachers emphasize, compared with the skills and values taught elsewhere. He shows how businessmen in Germany and Japan cooperate with educators in creating programs to prepare \"mid-kids\" - average high school students - for solid careers and how innovative American communities are developing similar strategies.",

Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: A Savannah Story  is a sublime and seductive reading experience.\u00a0\u00a0Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city is certain to become a modern classic.",

Her enduring subject, she tells us in the book's introduction, is \"the world as we experience it, a place where life spills over the retaining walls\" - and whether she is reflecting on the abortion wars, the changing roles of men and women, or the tensions and consolations of marriage and family life, her distinctive blend of cool reasonableness and sudden intuition strikes the reader again and again as the voice of our common wisdom. In everything she writes, Goodman is in search of our values, our \"ethics and standards, the qualities in life that mean the most to us. The things that matter.\" Always genuine, continually provocative, surprising, and beguiling, Value Judgments leaves the reader with a refreshed and deepened understanding of the complex world that is ours.",

        "Title": "Coming Apart: A Memoir of the Harvard Wars of 1969",
        "Authors": "By Rosenblatt, Roger",
        "Description": "On the afternoon of April 9, 1969, Roger Rosenblatt, then a young English instructor at Harvard, stepped out of his classroom building. There, across the Yard, he saw students hanging out of the windows of the main administrative building, waving revolutionary flags and chanting. The student uprisings that were rocking the country had finally come to America's most prestigious university. In short order, the demonstrators forcibly ejected deans from their offices. Less than twenty-four hours later - in an act unprecedented in Harvard's history - the University president invited local police to storm the Yard, and in riot gear, they attacked the students with tear gas and truncheons.In the turbulent weeks that followed, Rosenblatt soon found himself at the center of the chaos. As the Senior Tutor in an undergraduate House, he sat up night after night counseling angry, frightened students. As a member of the faculty committee formed to investigate the takeover and determine punishments, he saw just how fragile the bonds were that held the University together. For himself, Rosenblatt gained a very special Harvard education.Drawing on the recollections of faculty - Archibald Cox, Derek Bok, John Kenneth Galbraith, John Dunlop, James Q. Wilson, and Martin Peretz - and of students - Al Gore, Michael Kinsley, James Fallows, Frank Rich, Christopher Durang, and Mark Helprin - Rosenblatt has written an eloquent, often ironic, sometimes funny memoir that can be read as modern history and as a moral tale about a time when people persuaded themselves that they could fix things by taking them apart.",

        "Description": "Millions watch it. Billions are spent on it. Yet few fans know what life is really like in the NFL. Now an eight-year veteran of the game and a rising sports media superstar reveals - for the first time - the pathos, the horror, the abuses, and the wonder of the sport they call professional football.Fame and fortune, satisfaction, and thrills define the dream of playing in the NFL. But there's a dark side to that dream. And no one knows it better than Tim Green, former defensive end for the Atlanta Falcons, a featured color analyst for Fox Sports, and National Public Radio's weekly NFL commentator.Unreported things happen during the season when the player is on the field - and on the sidelines and in the locker rooms. Unreported things also happen during the 149 days of the year when the player is not on the field. All of it takes its toll on the human body and spirit. In professional football, there is a price and it must be paid.Here's the play-by-play the NFL powers-that-be don't want you to know: the futility of training camp - and the outrageous lengths players go to get out of it; the paradoxes of pain protection - goodbye padding, hello drugs; the untold war inside every team between the offensive and defensive squads; the truth about groupies and NFL players; the thriving perfect partnership between the mob and the NFL; what the salary cap really is - and why players hate it; the best - and worst - places to play in the NFL; and the score on racism, AIDS, gambling, steroids, and life after football.",

Somehow the whole world looks like little altars everywhere.\"Little Altars Everywhere is a national best-seller, a companion to Rebecca Wells's celebrated novel Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Originally published in 1992, Little Altars introduces Sidda, Vivi, the rest of the spirited walker clan, and the indomitable Ya-Yas. It is now available for the first time in hardcover.Told in alternating voices of Vivi and her husband, Big Shep, along with Sidda, her siblings Little Shep, Lulu, Baylor, and Cheney and Willetta--the black couple who impact the Walkers' lives in ways they never fully comprehend--Little Altars embraces nearly thirty years of life on the plantation in Thorton, Louisiana, where the cloying air of the bayou and a web of family secrets at once shelter, trap and define an utterly original community of souls.Who can resist such cadences of Sidda Walker and her flamboyant, secretive mother, ViVi? Here the young Sidda -- a precocious reader and an eloquent observer of the fault lines that divide her family -- leads us on a mischievous adventures at Our Lady of Divine Compassion parochial school and beyond. A Catholic girl of pristine manners, devotion, and provocative ideas, Sidda is the very essence of childhood sorrow and joy and sorrow.In a series of Luminous reminiscences, we also hear Little Shep's stories of his eccentric grandmother, Lulu's matter-of-fact account of her shoplifting skills, and Baylor's memories of Vivi and her friends, the Ya-Yas. Beneath the humor and tight-knit bonds of family and friendship lie the undercurrents of alcoholism, abuse, and violence. The overlapping recollections of how the Walkers' charming life uncoils to convey their heart-breaking confusion are oat once unsettling and familiar. Wells creates an unforgettable portrait of the eccentric cast of characters and exposes their poignant and funny attempts to keep reality at arm's length. Through our laughter we feel their inevitable pain, with a glimmer of hope for forgiveness and healing.An arresting combination of colloquialism, poetry, and grace Little Altars Everywhere is an insightful, piercing and unflinching evocation of childhood, a loving tribute to the transformative power of faith, and thoroughly fresh chronicle of a family that is as haunted as it is blessed.",

Uncle Harvey believes he is the embodiment of the Weather Channel's \"Local Forecast,\" even though all meteorological evidence points to the contrary. His niece, Josie, is fixed with a different predicament -- she's young and pretty, with nowhere to go except into deep trouble. Her mother, Elaine, lives under a fa\u00e7ade of cheerful efficiency, desperately masking a far more urgent quest.

        "Description": "To Libby Mason, Mr. Right has always meant Mr. Rich.  A twenty-seven-year-old publicist, she\u2019s barely able to afford her fashionable and fabulous lifestyle, and often has to foot the bill for dates with Struggling Writer Nick, a sexy but perpetually strapped-for-cash guy she\u2019s dating (no commitments\u2013really).  So when Ed, Britain\u2019s wealthiest but stodgiest bachelor, enters the picture, her idea of the fairy-tale romance is turned on its head. Libby soon finds herself weighing the advantages of Nick\u2019s sexual prowess and tender heart against Ed\u2019s luxurious lifestyle and unlimited retail therapy. But when the diamond shopping commences, Libby is forced to realize that the time for \u201cmaybe\u201d is up.  Taking romantic comedy to a hip, sparkling new level, Mr. Maybe is a classic tale of what happens to one girl when her heart and her head aren\u2019t looking for the same thing.

        "Authors": "By Rosen, Michael J. (EDT)",
        "Description": "More seriously funny writing from American's most trusted humor anthology Witty, wise, and just plain wonderful, the inaugural volume of this biennial, Mirth of a Nation, ensured a place for the best contemporary humor writing in the country. And with this second treasury, Michael J. Rosen has once again assembled a triumphant salute to one of America's greatest assets: its sense of humor. More than five dozen acclaimed authors showcase their hilariously inventive works, including Paul Rudnick, Henry Alford, Susan McCarthy, Media Person Lewis Grossberger, Ian Frazier, Richard Bausch, Amy Krouse Rosenthal, Nell Scovell, Andy Borowitz, and Ben Greenman -- just to mention a handful so that the other contributors can justify their feelings that the world slights them. But there's more! More Mirth of a Nation includes scads of Unnatural Histories from Randy Cohen, Will Durst's \"Top Top-100 Lists\" (including the top 100 colors, foods, and body parts), and three unabridged (albeit rather short) chapbooks: David Bader's \"How to Meditate Faster\" (Enlightenment for those who keep asking, \"Are we done yet?\") Matt Neuman's \"49 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth\" (for instance, \"Make your own honey\" and \"Share your shower.\") Francis Heaney's \"Holy Tango of Poetry\" (which answers the question, \"What if poets wrote poems whose titles were anagrams of their names, i.e., 'Toilets,' by T. S. Eliot?\") And there's still more: \"The Periodic Table of Rejected Elements,\" meaningless fables, Van Gogh's Etch A Sketch drawings, a Zagat's survey of existence, an international baby-naming encyclopedia, Aristotle's long-lost treatise \"On Baseball,\" and an unhealthy selection of letters from Dr. Science's mailbag. And that's just for starters! Just remember, as one reviewer wrote of the first volume, \"Don't drink milk while reading.\"",

After all, who but a wise guy would blow the toilet in his new home to smithereens with an M-80 firecracker? Or end up in a hotel lobby wearing nothing but strawberry underwear and the latest addition of USA Today? Only Ken Davis could pull these stranger than life stories together and use them to drive home insights that cut to the heart of Christ-like living. Because Ken, being Ken, knows what human fallibility is all about. He knows how tough we adults can be on ourselves. He knows how hard we try to appear more together than we really are. And to all of us, he offers two words of very solid wisdom: LIGHTEN UP!  Ken's hilarious and touching stories underscore one simple, encouraging theme: God's grace is for you. You're not perfect, but you are perfectly loved by God. So take heart. God doesn't just love you, he enjoys you. No reason you shouldn't, too!",

Not just Dave's, but that of the whole Baby Boom Generation--those millions of us who set a standard for whining self-absorption that will never be equaled, and who gave birth to such stunning accomplishments as Saturday Night Live!, the New Age movement, and call waiting. Here Dave pinpoints the glaring signs that you've passed the half-century mark:- You are suddenly unable to read anything written in letters smaller than Marlon Brando.- You have accepted the fact that you can't possibly be hip. You don't even know if \"hip\" is the right word for hip anymore, and you don't care.- You remember nuclear-attack drills at school wherein you practiced protecting yourself by crouching under your desk, which was apparently made out of some kind of atomic-bomb-proof wood.- You can't name the secretary of defense, but you can still sing the Mister Clean song.So pop open a can of Geritol\u00ae, kick back in that recliner, grab those reading glasses, and let the good times roll--before they roll right over you!",

His name is Jakob Beer. He is only seven years old. And although by all rights he should have shared the fate of the other Jews in his village, he has not only survived but been rescued by a Greek geologist, who does not recognize the boy as human until he begins to cry. With this electrifying image, Anne Michaels ushers us into her rapturously acclaimed novel of loss, memory, history, and redemption. \u00a0 As Michaels follows Jakob across two continents, she lets us witness his transformation from a half-wild casualty of the Holocaust to an artist who extracts meaning from its abyss. Filled with mysterious symmetries and rendered in heart-stopping prose, Fugitive Pieces is a triumphant work, a book that should not so much be read as it should be surrendered to.",
