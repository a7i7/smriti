What none of them know is how to stop these Michelangelos of crime, who for thirty years have eluded jail-and even arrest. Their secret is at the heart of George Higgins's most searing and shocking dissection of the criminal life yet. At End of Day lays bare not only the inner workings of a criminal empire, but also reveals the corruption at the heart of American law enforcement. Few writers have mapped the intricate highways and byways of crime with equal vividness and elegance, and with At End of Day, Higgins has created a cast of characters to match his unique gifts. McKeach and Cistaro stand shoulder-to-shoulder with any of Eddie Coyle's friends, and their story solidifies George Higgins's place in the forefront of novelists who write about crime in America.",

He examines the new federal law requiring prospective fathers to free themselves from their self-made macho prisons--to laugh, cry, love and just generally behave like certified wimps.Dave also reveals, for the first time in print, the secret chant for painless childbirth.Then learn why no secret chant could possibly take a woman's mind off the fact that she is in such pain that she wants a gigantic comet to crash into the earth and kill her and her husband and the dotor and the nurses and everyone else in the world.",

        "Authors": "By Brock, David",
        "Description": "David Brock, America's most controversial journalist, has taken on the most controversial first lady in history, producing a boldly incisive yet surprisingly sensitive portrait. The Hillary Rodham who emerges from these pages is not just a fascinating and important figure in her own right but the figurehead and unofficial leader of an activist liberal cohort that was born in the social and civil unrest of the 1960s and has risen to the highest levels of American government. A political biography of the highest order, The Seduction of Hillary Rodham is the story of one strong-willed woman's struggle to maintain her personal and political integrity in the face of powerfully seductive forces: the allure of a religiously inspired progressive ideology that engendered easy certitudes; the temptations of exercising unencumbered political power in a one-party state; and above all, the appeal of Bill Clinton, a charismatic, talented, but deeply flawed man who may have been both the best and worst thing that ever happened to Hillary Rodham.With unparalleled depth, Brock profiles Hillary's early mentors; delves into the byzantine world of Arkansas politics; and describes in explicit detail what Hillary has done to ensure Bill's meteoric rise to the top of American politics. Along the way, Hillary comes to terms with the strains in her marriage and undergoes multiple makeovers for the sake of an unprecedented political partnership. She plays an extensive role in staffing the Clinton White House and shaping its agenda, but her vaunted health care initiative ends in spectacular collapse and much of the still-brewing Whitewater scandal is laid at her door.Concluding that Hillary is neither the selfless and untarnished icon that her allies would portray nor the scheming Lady MacBeth of conservative demonology, Brock illuminates the character and actions of one of America's most poorly understood and unfairly maligned public figures.",

From the newly revised \"Nutcracker\" to \"Frosty the Persun of Snow,\" these stories rekindle the true holiday spirit and redefine the idea of \"good will to all men\" to include womyn, pre-adults, and companion animals as well.",

As Boston reels from the shock of such a tragedy, newspapers across the city scramble to get the biggest story in this city's recent history. Who would wish harm upon a man regarded as a sainted soul who dedicated his life to helping the poor and downtrodden?The Boston Post has put its best investigative reporter on the case. Frank Cronin has achieved near celebrity status himself as a shrewd, tireless journalist who always manages to get his story - even if it means bending the rules, ignoring conventional wisdom, or bucking political pressures. Before long, while rival papers are still printing their glowing eulogies, Cronin is hunting down the story no one else wants to know about. In death, facts about Councillor Philip Stewart are emerging that raise troubling questions about the true nature of his life, his character, and his deeds.As Cronin persists in stripping back the facade that in life made Stewart such a beloved public figure, the trouble begins. With pressure mounting to leave the dead man's reputation alone, Cronin must put everything on the line - his job, his reputation, even his life - as he decides just how much of the truth to tell.Digging ever deeper into Stewart's past, Cronin moves inexorably closer to unmasking the killer and his motive - but just when you think you know exactly what to expect, the story takes a stunning turn.",

By 1830, their graceful life of parties and parlor games begins to shatter. Gangs of Georgia vigilantes roam the roads. Treaties have been broken. Trouble rumbles closer, forcing men to choose sides. And Temple's fiance, reckless, dangerously seductive \"The Blade\" Stuart, knows the old ways Temple so dearly loves are coming to an end.Soon Temple and her entire family - including her tormented teenage brother Kipp and the Gordons' slaves, who have dreams of their own - are caught in a crossfire of tribal arguments and government betrayal.

A schoolteacher who arrives from New England expecting wilderness and savages, she finds instead a loving, genteel family to inspire her loyalty and devotion.Yet no one can stop the Cherokees' history from being written in blood. Challenged by tragedy and hardship, Temple will face losing everything and everyone she knows, as the Cherokees are forced westward by the government in Washington. Now desperate to be with the man she loves, determined to defy the world and stay by his side, Temple becomes a woman whose valor is forged by tears . . . and whose future lies at the end of a journey to a wild and turbulent destiny.An epic novel of sweeping grandeur, The Proud and the Free combines factual history with a wonderfully imagined cast of characters set against the scenic antebellum South.

Pogrebin's journey out of her forties and into her fifties becomes a user-friendly map of this challenging terrain as she demystifies the fears most people can't face and celebrates the possibilities most people can't see.Every woman who is facing fifty or has already moved past it will be grateful for this warm, witty exploration of the indignities and epiphanies of midlife, large and small.

Discovering one day that you can no longer read the phone book. Finally figuring out what you want to be when you grow up.

        "Authors": "By Mungo, Paul and Clough, Bryan",
        "Description": "A place has been created that has no physical dimensions. It can only be reached with a computer. You can hear it in the hum of a modem or the whistle of a fax machine, and see it in the lines on a computer screen, but you can never touch it. This place is a network of connections - from microwaves and fiber-optical cables to telephones, computers, and data banks, it is an ethereal web that links every remote corner of the world. It controls the technology that runs our lives, managing the flow of information, communication, and money, and it is now riddled with arcane computer viruses, overrun by adolescent hackers, and disputed in the electronic turf wars of high-tech street gangs.This place is called Cyberspace, a technological frontier where the outlaws are sophisticated computer renegades - hackers, phreakers, and virus writers who know the interconnected electronic networks as well as the engineers and programmers who built them. Using only small personal computers, hackers with names like Captain Zap and Acid Phreak, or hacker gangs like Rabid and the Legion of Doom, can infiltrate the protected and secured computers at the Pentagon, NATO, or NASA at will. They can roam invisibly through the electronic switches and links of our telephone network and tap into the computers that hold the credit records of all Americans, altering data and copying credit card numbers and access codes. They can even hack into the world's largest banking systems, and have learned how to transfer funds into their own accounts.In recent years, Cyberspace has been invaded by viruses with names like Number of the Beast, LoveChild, and Michelangelo, which can erase data and cause computers to crash. The shadowy creators of these viruses, working from obscure places like Bulgaria, Indonesia, or Thailand, have invented scores of pernicious programs that will infect as many as 12 million of the world's 90 million PCs over the next two years.Approaching Zero is the definitive history of the computer underworld, from its obscure origins in the phone phreaking of the late sixties to the extraordinary international phenomenon it has become in the present day. The book captures the exploits of the most accomplished data criminals, like Bulgaria's Dark Avenger, whose viruses have devastated systems across the world, and Fry Guy, in Indiana, who at the age of fifteen tampered with credit records and fund transfers for personal gain. It also charts the development of the other forms of electronic blight - the rabbits, trojans, logic bombs, and worms - as well as the international dimensions of the computer underworld, from America to Britain to Germany, then to Bulgaria, Russia, and the Far East. It is the first book to define the technological subculture of phreaking, hacking, and virus writing, and to put these elements into the context of our increasingly technology-dependent society, for in the future all crime will be data crime.",

        "Description": "As an outspoken lawyer, law professor, bestselling author, and public personality extraordinaire, Alan M. Dershowitz has been a controversial and vocal critic of the status quo for more than two decades. Never afraid to tackle controversy or take on an unpopular case, Dershowitz has emerged as the nation's preeminent civil libertarian. While his list of clients, including Claus Von Bulow, Jim Bakker, Leona Helmsley, Michael Milken, and Mike Tyson may read like a who's-who of celebrity outcasts, Dershowitz has also devoted countless hours to uncelebrated legal work on behalf of victims of shoddy law and social injustice. As a political gadfly and enemy of anti-Semitism, he has challenged the Polish Catholic hierarchy on its own ground and publicly admonished former Soviet President Gorbachev to renounce Soviet anti-Semitism. He has denounced critics who hold democratic Israel to an unrealistically high standard of behavior while turning a blind eye towards the massive human rights violations of its hostile neighbors. He has blasted the appointments Reagan and Bush have made to the Supreme Court, calling the current chief justice an \"enemy of liberty,\" and characterizing several recent appointees as \"mediocrities in robes.\"In Contrary to Popular Opinion Dershowitz selects his most recent columns, articles and essays and adds original commentary to present an engaging and spirited discussion from a remarkable mind about the most pressing issues of our time. Readers of Dershowitz's previous bestsellers, The Best Defense, Reversal of Fortune, and Chutzpah, will delight to see that Contrary to Popular Opinion continues Dershowitz's style of studied audacity. No matter how sensitive or incendiary the subject, Dershowitz is never afraid to say what is on his mind and back it up with solid and surprising arguments. In Contrary to Popular Opinion Dershowitz continues his crusade against blatant and subtle examples of anti-Semitism; dissects the \"political correctness\" controversy; exposes well-meaning censors on both the right and the left; blasts Bush's overtures to Beijing's repressive regime; makes a strong case for arresting and trying Yasir Arafat; questions the fairness of the RICO laws; makes a surprising pro-choice argument for the overturn of Roe v. Wade; wonders aloud about the damage the \"war on drugs\" is doing to our civil liberties; and condemns the ominous odor of fascism and bigotry rising from such diverse quarters as Russia's Pamyat and the Presidential campaigns of David Duke and Patrick Buchanan.No matter what your political convictions, Alan Dershowitz is certain to delight and inform and possibly surprise you. In an age when political discourse has gone the way of the sound-bite, Alan Dershowitz provides a stimulating dose of that all-too-rare commodity - original thought compellingly presented.",

        "Description": "\"We live in a time of unprecedented market uncertainty, where the order of the day is often disorder,\" warns author Allan J. Magrath. Breaking through the marketing maelstrom of issues, priorities, and questions is perhaps the most difficult challenge for any company that wants to be a market leader. The 6 Imperatives of Marketing presents Magrath's insightful analysis of how to meet this challenge--based on the experiences of more than 300 highly successful organizations in 40 different industries. His lucid and objective viewpoint allows you to mentally stand back from the storm and get a clear sense of which issues are critical and which are mere distractions.As Magrath shows, \"winner\" companies concentrate their attention on six key areas:1. Marketing productivity2. Innovation3. Distribution channels4. Alliances5. Globalization6. QualityThe 6 Imperatives of Marketing examines these urgent issues, interweaving Magrath's lively observations with hundreds of examples of actual marketing victories. The book takes you on a fascinating sightseeing tour of the dilemmas, debates, and decisions these companies experienced--and are still working through. For instance, you'll learn about how the tightly-focused marketing productivity of Polaroid helped it beat out the much larger Kodak in the instant photography category... or how Braun uses innovation in product design... or how lumber chain Home Depot uses innovation in staffing... or how GE requires that one of its distributors, Cameron and Barkley Co., provides just-in-time service, with all inventory and orders routed through GE's computers... or how A.T. Cross invested its marketing energy in the global market for a decade and watched its sales grow from $20 million to $200 million.Each chapter focuses on one imperative, breaks it apart, and provides focused advice on how to deal with it--in terms the practicing manager can put to use immediately.In today's marketing-driven competitive environment, all forward-looking managers must consider the marketing strategies their company is using and how to tie those strategies into overall business strategy. The 6 Imperatives of Marketing alerts you to the critical make-or-break issues--and shows you how to deal with them before they break you.",

He returns to a city where Prohibition has been repealed and a dark underworld is developing a new source of profits--illegal heroin trafficking. Meanwhile, legitimate industries are launching an offensive against unionization and the specter of Communism--and they're not above fighting dirty.  When Victor's old Army buddy, Freddy Stillman, a munitions salesman, reports a murder but can't explain why the body has disappeared, he unwittingly pulls himself and Victor into the bewildering swirl of corruption and conspiracy that encompasses everyone in the book's vast, raging cityscape. Combining the atmospheric richness of Dashiell Hammett and the irresistible, subversive humor of Thomas Pynchon, The Disappearing Body weaves suspenseful mystery into a stunning, darkly hilarious portrait of urban America between the wars.",

But one day she gets a letter - sent from the small Oklahoma town where she grew up - that brings it all back. Memories of people she had once known and loved dearly - and of the sultry summer when her life changed forever...In the summer of 1944, Gretchen Gilman was working as a reporter at the local newspaper. Her assignments weren't very exciting - she mostly wrote about local boys just back from the war - but it was a good opportunity for a young woman with talent and ambition to spare. Gretchen knew better than anyone what people in town were talking about. And that summer they were talking about Faye Tatum.Just hours after Faye was found dead in her own living room, the speculation began. Murdered, people said, by her jealous husband - just back from the war - who hadn't been seen since the night of her death. A woman, they whispered, who got what she deserved. Shouldn't have been dancing down at the bar - and with a different man every night. Just imagine! What kind of example is that for her daughter? It seemed like the gossip would never stop...But Gretchen knew a different Faye - the talented artist, the devoted mother, the kind, fun-loving neighbor. She knew the circumstances of Faye's life and death were much different than people imagined - and she was determined to uncover the truth once and for all.

        "Description": "For more than twenty-five years, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has made children her passion and her cause. Her long experience with children -- not only through her personal roles as mother, daughter, sister, and wife but also as advocate, legal expert, and public servant -- has strengthened her conviction that how children develop and what they need to succeed are inextricably entwined with the society in which they live and how well it sustains and supports its families and individuals. In other words, it takes a village to raise a child.  This book chronicles her quest -- both deeply personal and, in the truest sense, public -- to discover how we can make our society into the kind of village that enables children to grow into able, caring, resilient adults. It is time, Mrs. Clinton believes, to acknowledge that we have to make some changes for our children's sake. Advances in technology and the global economy along with other developments society have brought us much good, but they have also strained the fabric of family life, leaving us and our children poorer in many ways -- physically, intellectually, emotionally, spiritually.  She doesn't believe that we should, or can, turn back the clock to \"the good old days.\" False nostalgia for \"family values\" is no solution. Nor is it useful to make an all-purpose bogeyman or savior of \"government.\" But by looking honestly at the condition of our children, by understanding the wealth of new information research offers us about them, and, most important, by listening to the children themselves, we can begin a more fruitful discussion about their needs. And by sifting the past for clues to the structures that once bound us together, by looking with an open mind at what other countries and cultures do for their children that we do not, and by identifying places where our \"village\" is flourishing -- in families, schools, churches, businesses, civic organizations, even in cyberspace -- we can begin to create for our children the better tomorrow they deserve.",

Lately, low-carb diets have been all the rage, but until recently little scientific research has been available regarding their effectiveness and potential health consequences. Now, studies are proving that low-carb diets do work and, contrary to popular belief, they don't pose health risks-if they are done right. But with so many diets to choose from, it is hard for many people to find a program that is realistic for their lifestyle and to which they can adhere. Nationally recognized nutritionist Sandra Woodruff demystifies the process and explains how anyone can tailor a low-carb plan to their individual needs to achieve long-term weight loss. She provides hundreds of delicious recipes, innovative menu plans, instructive cooking tips, and helpful advice for eating out. The healthy eating plan in Secrets of Good-Carb/Low-Carb Living includes lean proteins, healthy fats, and good carbs to not only lose weight but also to lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels and help correct metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Now anyone can get better results from their low-carb diet or formulate a new eating plan specifically for their needs. With Sandra Woodruff, low-carb living never tasted so good!",

        "Title": "The Kennedy Women: The Saga of an American Family",
        "Authors": "By Leamer, Laurence",
        "Description": "Monumental in scope and extraordinary in sensitivity, The Kennedy Women chronicles five matrilineal generations in our nation's premier political dynasty. Not merely distinguished cultural history, it is a story of epic sweep, brimming with triumph and tragedy, courage and compliance, self-sacrifice and self-delusion.Moving from steerage on an immigrant vessel to the slums of Boston, from the Court of St. James's to the White House and beyond, The Kennedy Women paints startling, in-depth portraits of the mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters who stood beside some of the most dynamic men of the twentieth century through occasions of great opulence and heartbreak, victory and scandal. Among its revelations: how Rose's marriage almost ended on her wedding day; the poignantly detailed life stories of mentally challenged Rosemary and the glorious, lost Kathleen; Jackie's near death in the weeks before the inauguration; Eunice's struggle, despite chronic illness, to build the Special Olympics; a long-guarded account of Rose's response to Chappaquiddick; Jean Kennedy Smith's and the family's private reactions to the William Kennedy Smith rape charges; Jackie's gallant battle to live and die with dignity and privacy; and the unique challenges and pressures confronting future Kennedy matriarchs Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, Maria Shriver Schwarzenegger, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, and Rory Kennedy.Here, finally, is the women's story; even those who feel they know all there is to know about the Kennedys will discover how much more there is to the story. For five years, Laurence Leamer researched this book, receiving unprecedented cooperation from family members, interviewing scores of relatives and close associates, gaining access to hundreds of personal documents. Included are thirty-two pages of rare and fascinating family photographs.The Kennedy Women combines exhaustive and superb scholarship with a gripping narrative that will alter forever our perception of America's royal family.",

        "Authors": "By Brokaw, Tom",
        "Description": "Reflections on America and the American experience as he has lived and observed it, by the bestselling author ofThe Greatest Generation.In this beautiful memoir, Tom Brokaw writes of America and of the American experience. From his parents\u2019 life in theThirties, on to his boyhood along the Missouri River and on the prairies of South Dakota in the Forties, into his early journalism career in the Fifties and the tumultuous Sixties, up to the present, this personal story is a reflection on America in our time. Tom Brokaw writes about growing up and coming of age in the heartland, and of the family, the people, the culture and the values that shaped him then and still do today. His father, Red Brokaw, a genius with machines, followed the instincts of Tom's mother Jean, and took the risk of moving his small family from an Army base to Pickstown, South Dakota, where Red got a job as a heavy equipment operator in the Army Corps of Engineers' project building the Ft. Randall dam along the Missouri River. Tom Brokaw describes how this move became the pivotal decision in their lives, as the Brokaw family, along with others after World War II, began to live out the American Dream: community, relative prosperity, middle class pleasures and good educations for their children. \"Along the river and in the surrounding hills, I had a Tom Sawyer boyhood,\" Brokaw writes; and as he describes his own pilgrimage as it unfolded\u2013from childhood to love, marriage, the early days in broadcast journalism, and beyond\u2013he also reflects on what brought him and so many Americans of his generation to lead lives a long way from home, yet forever affected by it.",

        "Title": "I Am a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story",
        "Authors": "By Bragg, Rick and Lynch, Jessica (CON)",
        "Description": "I Am a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story is the story this country has hungered for, as told by Jessica Lynch herself to Rick Bragg. In it, she tells what really happened in the ambush; what really happened in the hospital; what really happened, from her perspective, on the night of the rescue. More than this, the collaboration between Lynch and Bragg captures who she is and where she's from: her childhood in Palestine, West Virginia, a lovely, rugged stretch of land always referred to as the hollow, where she rode horses, played softball, and was crowned Miss Congeniality at the Wirt County Fair the same year the steer she raised took a ribbon. It reveals her relationships with her older brother, Greg Jr., also an enlisted soldier, and her younger sister, Brandi; with her father, Greg Sr., a forty-three-year-old truck driver who has at times worked construction, cut hay, cut firewood, hauled timber, hauled concrete, run a bulldozer, run a backhoe, cleaned houses, and dug graves; and with her mother, Deadra, a city girl from Parkersburg who moved to the hollow and met her future husband when he was eleven and she was nine. And it describes what happened to the Lynch family in the agony of Jessica's capture and captivity; the terror and disbelief that cascaded through an entire town at the news of her disappearance into enemy hands; the joy of her rescue; and the long work of healing and recovery that lie ahead. Jessica Lynch has won the hearts and minds of Americans. In the hands of Rick Bragg, a renowned chronicler of American lives, her tale is told at last.",

A mesmerizing and achingly beautiful debut.Winter, 1919. Amanda Starkey spends her days nursing soldiers wounded in the Great War. Finding herself suddenly overwhelmed, she flees Milwaukee and retreats to her family's farm on Nagawaukee Lake, seeking comfort with her younger sister, Mathilda, and three-year-old niece, Ruth. But very soon, Amanda comes to see that her old home is no refuge--she has carried her troubles with her. On one terrible night almost a year later, Amanda loses nearly everything that is dearest to her when her sister mysteriously disappears and is later found drowned beneath the ice that covers the lake. When Mathilda's husband comes home from the war, wounded and troubled himself, he finds that Amanda has taken charge of Ruth and the farm, assuming her responsibility with a frightening intensity. Wry and guarded, Amanda tells the story of her family in careful doses, as anxious to hide from herself as from us the secrets of her own past and of that night.Ruth, haunted by her own memory of that fateful night, grows up under the watchful eye of her prickly and possessive aunt and gradually becomes aware of the odd events of her childhood. As she tells her own story with increasing clarity, she reveals the mounting toll that her aunt's secrets exact from her family and everyone around her, until the heartrending truth is uncovered.Guiding us through the lives of the Starkey women, Christina Schwarz's first novel shows her compassion and a unique understanding of the American landscape and the people who live on it.",

Together they give us an extraordinary panorama of American life and work throughout this century and underscore the ways in which the times have changed.Coming of Age is also, in many ways, a sequel to Terkel's acclaimed Working (1974), for it traces the extraordinary ways our working lives have changed in the past few decades - often beyond recognition. We meet politicians and preachers, advertising men and hucksters. Here is the partner in a large law firm, suing the colleagues who have forced him out; here, too, is the carpenter, accepting as inevitable the replacement of his skilled tasks by machine. But this is not a group of disgruntled Luddites; most accept - indeed welcome - the new technologies, yet they all deplore the degree to which human contact has declined and how traditional hopes and aspirations have been superseded by the often ruthless demands of the modern corporation.",

Like his legendary predecessors, the tough and classy Boston PI has become an American institution. With Paper Doll, Robert B. Parker takes Spenser down a sinister path, where every welcome masks a warning and identity is paper-thin.Hired by Loudon Tripp, an aggrieved Boston aristocrat who believes the brutal street slaying of his wife, Olivia, to be something other than random violence, Spenser immediately senses Tripp's picture-perfect version of his family's life is false. For starters, the victim's reputation is far too saintly, while her house is as lived-in as a stage set and her troubled children don't appear the product of a happy home. Spenser plunges into a world of grand illusion, peopled by cardboard cutouts, including: a distinguished public servant with plenty to hide; a wealthy executive whose checks bounce; a sleepy southern town seething with scandal; and the ambiguous Olivia herself.Consummately mysterious and smokily sensual, Paper Doll is Parker and Spenser at their compelling best.",
