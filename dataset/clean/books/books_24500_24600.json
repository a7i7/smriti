        "Description": "Attorney Paul Madriani defends a highly decorated soldier who is on trial for murder, and unwittingly steps into a maze of secrets and lies that the government - and even this client - would rather leave hidden and undisturbed.Madriani is faced with arcane ballistics evidence, the so-called double tap - two bullet wounds tightly grouped to a victim's head, from shots that can have been made only by a crack marksman. Madriani's client is an enigma, a career soldier who refuses to talk about his past, though clearly he is a battle-tested pro. The victim was an alluring businesswoman and software tycoon whose empire catered to the military, and the most damning evidence is the weapon that killed her: a handgun used solely in special operations where the double tap is the trademark of the most skilled assassins.Madriani begins to have new fears about his client, a man who would rather sit on a legal time bomb than talk about his past and get a chance at acquittal. And yet more troubling, Madriani discovers that the victim was involved in a controversial government contract to combat terrorism by combing through the private computer records of millions of American citizens.Madriani faces a wilderness of mirrors in a courtroom battle where every witness can hide behind \"national security,\" where information is power and digital information is absolute power. It is a war in which the scales of justice are being tipped by evasion, deceit - and murder. Finding the unvarnished truth has never been so elusive - or so dangerous.",

There is an important decision to be made. The Cornish Foundation is thriving under the directorship of Arthur Cornish when Arthur and his beguiling wife, Maria Theotoky, decide to undertake a project worthy of Francis Cornish -- connoisseur, collector, and notable eccentric -- whose vast fortune endows the Foundation. The grumpy, grimy, extraordinarily talented music student Hulda Schnakenburg is commissioned to complete E. T .A. Hoffmann\u2019s unfinished opera\u00a0Arthur of Britain, or The Magnanimous Cuckold; and the scholarly priest Simon Darcourt finds himself charged with writing the libretto. \u00a0 Complications both practical and emotional arise: the gypsy in Maria\u2019s blood rises with a vengeance; Darcourt stoops to petty crime; and various others indulge in perjury, blackmail, and other unsavory pursuits. Hoffmann\u2019s dictum, \"the lyre of Orpheus opens the door of the underworld,\" seems to be all too true -- especially when the long-hidden secrets of Francis Cornish himself are finally revealed. \u00a0 Baroque and deliciously funny, this third book in The Cornish Trilogy shows Robertson Davies at his very considerable best.\"Robertson Davies is the sort of novelist readers can hardly wait to tell their friends about.\" -- The Washington Post Book World",

        "Description": "In the spring of 1947, Jackie Robinson played his first game with the Brooklyn Dodgers, breaking down baseball's decades-old color line and changing the face of the game forever. Now, in this intimate portrait, Robinson's widow, Rachel, tells her husband's story - and that of her life with him - from her unique perspective.But the tale of Jackie Robinson doesn't begin and end with baseball. It includes family, friends, and - after retirement - the business world and the civil rights movement. Confronted by challenges at every turn, together the Robinsons struggled to live to the fullest in every way. Rachel Robinson describes the trials the family faced as carefully as she relates her husband's thrilling triumphs on the diamond.With a compelling foreword by noted historian Roger Wilkins and epilogues by the Robinsons' two living children, Jackie Robinson: An Intimate Portrait presents a new and revealing picture of a man who is a hero to so many - black and white, old and young, male and female.",

The resulting volume is guaranteed to shake the assumptions of readers of every pigmentation and political allegiance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In What's Going On, McCall adds up the hidden costs of the stereotype of black athletic prowess, which tells African American teenagers that they can only succeed on the white man's terms. He introduces a fresh perspective to the debates on gangsta rap and sexual violence. He indicts the bigotry of white churches and the complacency of the black suburban middle class, celebrates the heroism of Muhammad Ali, and defends the truth-telling of Alice Walker. Engaging, provocative, and utterly fearless, here is a commentator to reckon with, addressing our most persistent divisions in a voice of stinging immediacy.",

Born into slavery in 1797, Truth fled from bondage some 30 years later to become a powerful figure in the progressive movements reshaping American society.This remarkable narrative, first published in 1850, offers a rare glimpse into the little-documented world of Northern slavery. Truth recounts her life as a slave in rural New York, her separation from her family, her religious conversion, and her life as a traveling preacher during the 1840s. She also describes her work as a social reformer, counselor of former slaves, and sponsor of a black migration to the West.A spellbinding orator and implacable prophet, Truth mesmerized audiences with her tales of life in bondage and with her moving renditions of Methodist hymns and her own songs. Frederick Douglass described her message as a \"strange compound of wit and wisdom, of wild enthusiasm, and flint-like common sense.\" This inspiring account of a black woman's struggles for racial and sexual equality is essential reading for students of American history, as well as for those interested in the continuing quest for equality of opportunity.",

His reason: the war was a senseless slaughter. He was officially classified \"mentally unsound\" and sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital. There a brilliant psychiatrist, Dr. William Rivers, set about restoring Sassoon's \"sanity\" and sending him back to the trenches. This novel tells what happened as only a novel can. It is a war saga in which not a shot is fired. It is a story of a battle for a man's mind in which only the reader can decide who is the victor, who the vanquished, and who the victim.       One of the most amazing feats of fiction of our time, Regneration has been hailed by critics across the globe.  As August 2014 marks the 100-year anniversary of World War I, this book is as timely and relevant as ever.",

        "Authors": "By D'Souza, Dinesh",
        "Description": "Ten years ago Ronald Reagan stood at the Berlin Wall and said, \"General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate. Tear down this wall.\" Soon after that, the wall came tumbling down, and the regime that Reagan called the \"evil empire\" was no more.  Looking back, we now recognize the 1980s as a remarkable decade: one that saw the spread of freedom and democracy around the world, the revival of the American economy, and the restoration of national spirit and pride after years of indefinable malaise.  Yet, oddly, the man who occupied the White House is not credited with the changes that occurred during those tumultuous years. His critics and even many of his aides and allies are reluctant to celebrate Reagan as a great president.  It's not hard to see why. He was a most unusual leader: a former actor who seemed disengaged from the daily operations of government. He was said to nap at cabinet meetings. He spent much of his time telling stories and cracking jokes, sometimes reinforcing his critics' perceptions. \"The doctors say hard work never killed anyone,\" Reagan once observed, \"but why take the chance?\"  How, then, can we square Reagan the man with the astonishing events of the Reagan era? The mystery of Reagan is best summarized in the remark that National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane made to Secretary of State George Shultz: \"He knows so little, and accomplishes so much.\"  In Ronald Reagan: How an Ordinary Man Became an Extraordinary Leader, Dinesh D'Souza solves the mystery of Reagan by showing how this \"ordinary\" man was able to transform the political landscape in a way that made a permanent impact on America and the world. Through firsthand reporting and interviews, D'Souza portrays the private side of Reagan -- the man behind the mask -- and reveals the moral sources of his vision and leadership.  Indeed, D'Souza argues that Reagan deserves to be considered one of the most important presidents in American history and, with Franklin Roosevelt, one of the two most influential of the 20th century. He concludes that, if Reagan does not fit our preconceptions of what makes a great leader, then we must rethink our understanding of both greatness and leadership.",

Into the chaos that has become typical of the modern American family, judge Judy Sheindlin attempts to bring some order. With Keep It Simple, Stupid, Judge Judy addresses how convoluted family life has become. The traditional nuclear family has expanded to include exes and parents of exes, merging families, stepchildren, lovers, adopted children, in-laws the list goes on and on.Complex issues naturally arise from the enlarged families into which we're born. There is the ex-wife who wants more child support from husband number one so she can stay home with new baby by husband number two. There are the parents who gave their daughter thirty thousand dollars as a wedding gift only to watch the marriage quickly crumble and their former son-in-law claim half the money. How about the adult son who runs out on his kids, leaving his parents to pay his child support? When it comes to families, Judge Judy has seen it all in her courtroom, and she knows stupidity when she sees it.Tackling all the explosive issues that drive families crazy -- and into court -- Judge Judy shares her on-target, brutally honest thoughts on the chaos that is characteristic of today's American family and gives no-holds-barred advice on how to resolve conflicts and repair relationships.",
