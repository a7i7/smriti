        "Authors": "By Bush, Barbara",
        "Description": "\"There is a myth in the United States -- you've heard it many times. It says that all American mothers hope that their child will grow up to be President of the United States. In my case that certainly is a myth. I never dreamed that any of ours would; there were days when I hoped they'd just grow up!...But on January 20, 2001...there we were sitting on the west side of the United States Capitol, waiting for our son George W. to be sworn in as the forty-third President of the United States of America.\"             -- from the Prologue  This inspiring follow-up to Barbara Bush's number one bestselling memoir covers the momentous eight years between President George H. W. Bush's leaving office and President George W. Bush's inauguration.  Not since Abigail Adams has one woman been both the wife and mother to a president. Barbara Bush's prominent place in American history is matched by her extraordinary popularity: Republicans and Democrats alike appreciate her wit, her compassion, and her devotion to her family. Dignified, loyal, and unpretentious, Barbara Bush defied skeptics to become one of the most admired first ladies in history; she remains a beloved public figure today.  Picking up where Barbara Bush: A Memoir left off, Reflections begins with the inauguration of her son, President George W. Bush, in January 2001, and then flashes back eight years to President Clinton's inauguration, when she and her husband President George H. W. Bush were leaving the White House. Drawing on excerpts from her diary, Mrs. Bush chronologically takes us through this time in her life, devoting one chapter to each year. She reveals her and her husband's inner lives through sometimes touching and often hilarious stories about their extensive travels, their hobbies, and their charity work. She discusses her experiences on the campaign trail with her sons, and relates her continuing interactions with VIPs from around the world. Mrs. Bush also touches on more controversial issues, such as her husband's resignation from the NRA, the caning of an American student in Singapore, and the hypocrisy of certain politicians. The extraordinary amount of love she feels for her family and the pride she takes in their many achievements is always clear, particularly when she writes of her relationships with her five children and fourteen grandchildren. In the epilogue, she reflects on the experience of having a president for a son and discusses the family's reactions to September 11, 2001, and its aftermath.  Reflections will delight Barbara Bush's millions of admirers with the former first lady's warmth and wit, as well as with candid revelations and anecdotes from the past decade of a full and fascinating life.",

It's too much like looking into his own future. But Kovac has a sixth sense for crime, and it's burning.",

As Father Girzone guides the reader,\u00a0\u00a0he brings us before a god who is neither silent\u00a0\u00a0nor condemning, but a patient God who heals gently\u00a0\u00a0and thoroughly, a realistic God who knows quite\u00a0\u00a0well how we function. We may be shocked or ashamed bv\u00a0\u00a0what we see in ourselves, but God understands.

        "Description": "\"What would you say if I told you that the secret to healthy, vigorous, and disease-free living might be as simple as knowing your blood type,\" ask Dr. Peter D'Adamo and Catherine Whitney, and in Eat Right 4 Your Type, they shows us the simple answer.     If you've ever suspected that not everyone should eat the same thing or do the same exercise, you're right. In fact, what foods we absorb well and how our bodies handle stress differ with each blood type.     Your blood type reflects your internal chemistry. It is the key that unlocks the mysteries of disease, longevity, fitness, and emotional strength. It determines your susceptibility to illness, the foods you should eat, and ways to avoid the most troubling health problems.     Only recently have all the pieces of the scientific and clinical puzzle started coming together. Dr. D'Adamo has spent the past fifteen years researching the connections among blood type and exercise, food, and disease, and his research is built on thirty years of work done by his father.     In Eat Right 4 Your Type he shows:   which foods, spices, teas, and condiments help someone of your blood type maintain optimal health and ideal weight;   which vitamins and supplements to emphasize or avoid;   which medications function best in your system;   whether your stress goes to your muscles or your nervous system;   whether your stress is relieved better through aerobics or meditation;   whether you should walk, swim or play tennis or golf as your mode of exercise;   how knowing your blood type can help you avoid many common viruses and infections;   how knowing your blood type can help you fight back against life-threatening diseases;   how to slow down the aging process by avoiding factors specific to your blood type that cause rapid cell deterioration.     Eat Right 4 Your Type provides a clear, simple life plan that anyone can follow and suggests the easiest ways to determine your blood type and diet for your blood type. Here is a breakthrough book that will change the way we eat and live.",

To the worlds of the interstellar Thousand Cultures, where the reborn are accepted as normal citizens, it's a monstrous crime and reinforces their distaste for Earth, which they consider the stagnant heart of humanity. If Giraut cannot stop Earth from ratifying its plans, the tenuous structure of interstellar human civilization will collapse. Complicating matters, Giraut's brain now hosts a second consciousness - the revived consciousness of his old, long-dead friend Raimbaut.

This vibrant, varied sampler of the American literary scene revels in life\u2019s little absurdities, captures timely personal and cultural challenges, and ultimately shares subtle insight and compassion. In \u201cThe View from Castle Rock,\u201d the short story master Alice Munro imagines a fictional account of her Scottish ancestors\u2019 emigration to Canada in 1818. Nathan Englander\u2019s cast of young characters in \u201cHow We Avenged the Blums\u201d confronts a bully dubbed \u201cThe Anti-Semite\u201d to both comic and tragic ends. In \u201cRefresh, Refresh,\u201d Benjamin Percy gives a forceful, heart-wrenching look at a young man\u2019s choices when his father -- along with most of the men in his small town -- is deployed to Iraq. Yiyun Li\u2019s \u201cAfter a Life\u201d reveals secrets, hidden shame, and cultural change in modern China. And in \u201cTatooizm,\u201d Kevin Moffett weaves a story full of humor and humanity about a young couple\u2019s relationship that has run its course.Ann Patchett \u201cbrought unprecedented enthusiasm and judiciousness [to The Best American Short Stories 2006],\u201d writes Katrina Kenison in her foreword, \u201cand she is, surely, every story writer\u2019s ideal reader, eager to love, slow to fault, exquisitely attentive to the text and all that lies beneath it.\u201d",

Next, examine the structure and shape of your home as well as its setting, and determine how these affect your life favorably or unfavorably. See how to furnish and decorate each room in the house in the best possible way. Guidance is given in choosing colors, fabrics, plants, mirrors, lighting, artwork, and other decorative elements. Arrange the seating in the living room to promote family harmony and sociability. Select table settings that will improve mealtimes. Situate your bed to enhance your communication skills, cure insomnia, or heighten romance. Regardless of how you want to improve your life, using Feng Shui you can get the forces of nature to work with you rather than against you.  Ward Lock 160 pages (all in color), 7 3/4 x 10.",

        "Authors": "By Kallos, Stephanie",
        "Description": "National best seller and Today show Book Club selection, Broken for You is the story of two women in self-imposed exile whose lives are transformed when their paths intersect. Stephanie Kallos's debut novel is a work of infinite charm, wit and heart. It is also a glorious homage to the beauty of broken things. When we meet septuagenarian Margaret Hughes, she is living alone in a mansion in Seattle with only a massive collection of valuable antiques for company. Enter Wanda Schultz, a young woman with a broken heart who has come west to search for her wayward boyfriend. Both women are guarding dark secrets and have spent many years building up protective armor against the outside world. As their tentative friendship evolves, the armor begins to fall away and Margaret opens her house to the younger woman. This launches a series of unanticipated events, leading Margaret to discover a way to redeem her cursed past, and Wanda to learn the true purpose of her cross-country journey. Both funny and heartbreaking, Broken for You is a testament to the saving graces of surrogate families and shows how far the tiniest repair jobs can go in righting the world's wrongs.",

        "Title": "The Working Poor: Invisible in America",
        "Authors": "By Shipler, David K.",
        "Description": "\u201cMost of the people I write about in this book do not have the luxury of rage. They are caught in exhausting struggles. Their wages do not lift them far enough from poverty to improve their lives, and their lives, in turn, hold them back. The term by which they are usually described, \u2018working poor,\u2019 should be an oxymoron. Nobody who works hard should be poor in America.\u201d \u2014from the Introduction    From the author of the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning Arab and Jew, a new book that presents a searing, intimate portrait of working American families struggling against insurmountable odds to escape poverty.     As David K. Shipler makes clear in this powerful, humane study, the invisible poor are engaged in the activity most respected in American ideology\u2014hard, honest work. But their version of the American Dream is a nightmare: low-paying, dead-end jobs; the profound failure of government to improve upon decaying housing, health care, and education; the failure of families to break the patterns of child abuse and substance abuse. Shipler exposes the interlocking problems by taking us into the sorrowful, infuriating, courageous lives of the poor\u2014white and black, Asian and Latino, citizens and immigrants. We encounter them every day, for they do jobs essential to the American economy.      We meet drifting farmworkers in North Carolina, exploited garment workers in New Hampshire, illegal immigrants trapped in the steaming kitchens of Los Angeles restaurants, addicts who struggle into productive work from the cruel streets of the nation\u2019s capital\u2014each life another aspect of a confounding, far-reaching urgent national crisis. And unlike most works on poverty, this one delves into the calculations of some employers as well\u2014their razor-thin profits, their anxieties about competition from abroad, their frustrations in finding qualified workers.     This impassioned book not only dissects the problems, but makes pointed, informed recommendations for change. It is a book that stands to make a difference.",

Masses of entrepreneurs and tech wizards, immigrants and investors, dreamers and visionaries, are heading west to seek their fortune and a new destiny. In Bronson, they have found their troubadour.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Already hailed by The Village Voice Literary Supplement as \"the most complete and empathetic portrait of the Valley so far,\" The Nudist on the Late Shift establishes Bronson as the first author to capture the spirit of this new mecca. Recently chosen by the VLS as one of 1999's     \"Writers on the Verge,\" Bronson has spent the past decade searching Silicon Valley for the best stories, several of which have been published in Wired. Now he has woven those stories together, taking us inside the world of the newcomers, brainiacs, salespeople, headhunters, utopians, plutocrats, and innovators who are transforming our culture.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Writes the VLS: \"Bronson evocatively portrays the overwhelming unpredictability of life in the Valley: getting fired can be part of daily life. But with a zero unemployment rate, the wounded don't stay that way for long. Bronson is at his best describing this radically shifting environment, where everyday folk with the right idea and the stamina stand to make millions in a couple of years, skipping rungs on the career ladder at a mind-boggling pace. Bronson recognizes that Silicon Valley's boom is made up of small explosions, and The Nudist puts us at ground zero.\"",

        "Authors": "By MacDonald, Anne L.",
        "Description": "\"What useful things have American women conceived of and developed that have contributed to the progress of technology, science, and engineering?\" Raise that question, even among educated feminists of the 1990s, and you are likely to be met with a fumbling for names. Raise it among the skeptics of women's creative talents and they will reply \"Where, after all, is the historical record?\"\"In the Patent Office,\" replies historian Anne L. Macdonald, author of Feminine Ingenuity. In her engaging and meticulously researched history of American women inventors, she presents not only the official evidence of women's remarkable achievements contained in two centuries' worth of Patent Office archives, but also a wealth of material she has discovered in unofficial contemporary accounts of women's inventions: magazines, journals, lectures, major fairs and expositions, and the manuscripts of several important inventors.Feminine Ingenuity celebrates the achievements of women inventors from Mary Kies, whose 1809 patent for a method of weaving straw was the first issued to a woman, to Gertrude Elion, the Nobel Prize Laureate whose anticancer drugs led to her 1991 election as the first woman in the Inventors Hall of Fame. It is not, however, a litany of accomplishments of previously unsung individual women, for Macdonald doesn't ignore the downside of women's struggle.Society, with its relentless assignment of females to the domestic sphere, discouraged mechanically talented girls by barring them from the kind of technical education it lavished upon their brothers. It took the Civil War and the consequent absence of their men to force these alumnae of required cooking and sewing classes to learn not only to operate farm machinery but to invent major improvements to it.By presenting women inventors against such a historical backdrop, Macdonald keys their experiences to the larger themes of women's changing economic, political, and social position. This makes Feminine Ingenuity a thought-provoking account of a significant and previously neglected aspect of the history of women.",
