Yet Patricia McCracken, her client and long-suffering friend, won't be satisfied until Goldy adds a hefty side order of revenge....Patricia is convinced that her obstetrician and her Health Maintenance Organization - penny-pinching ACHMO - are to blame for the recent loss of her baby. And the doctor in question is none other than John Richard Korman, Aspen Meadow's leading ob-gyn and Goldy's ex-husband, whose clean-cut good looks hide his dirty habit of battering women. Now Patricia is suing the doctor and ACHMO for malpractice, but that's not enough. She wants Goldy's advice on getting even - and coming out on top.At first, Goldy relishes the fact that her ex-husband is finally going to pay. For the handsome, charming, dangerous doctor deserves to be in a financial pickle. Even so, it's a horrid shock when John Richard is arrested for the murder of his current girlfriend, glamorous Suz Craig...especially when it's Goldy who makes the gruesome discovery.Shaken by the thought that she could easily have been the victim, Goldy feverishly throws herself into her work, grilling vegetables for Slapshot Salad and molding hockey-puck-shaped biscuits. But with her new husband, homicide cop Tom Schulz, relegated to the background of the case, and her fourteen-year-old son begging her to prove his father innocent, Goldy has no choice but to sift through Aspen Meadow's premium mix of sizzling gossip and reheated rumors for clues.The Grilling Season, replete with tantalizing recipes, is Diane Mott Davidson's tastiest mystery yet.",

Middle-aged, wealthy, and diffident, Anna has lived an ascetic life, submitting to the protective dependence of her frail mother and avoiding emotional entanglements with everyone else.Acquaintances don't think very much about Anna. Perhaps they have noticed her bland features or her patient smile. Certainly none of them has understood her complexity, the conspiracy into which she has entered, and the life she has denied herself.When her absence is reported to the police, the few people who knew Anna begin to wonder what could have happened to her: Mrs. Marsh, an elderly woman who observed Anna's intense relationship with her mother, and Lawrence Halliday, the reticent doctor whose interest in Anna may have been more than professional.As Anita Brookner's masterful story unfolds, we realize that none of the characters have been honest with one another or with themselves. To understand their connection to Anna's disturbing disappearance, they must first confront their own fraudulent behavior. What they discover is surprising and liberating, an unexpected contemporary response to the Jamesian dictum of Live all you can.Brilliantly written, filled with wisdom and insight, Fraud is Anita Brookner's triumphant portrait of a woman who finally takes charge of her own destiny.",

        "Description": "Marita Golden began her writing career with Migrations of the Heart, a memoir about living with her husband in his native Nigeria. In Migrations, Golden described how it was only with the birth of her child - a son - that she was truly respected, for in that culture males are held in the highest esteem. Ten years later, in SAVING OUR SONS, Golden presents, in essence, her son's story.Having returned to the United States from Nigeria, Marita and Michael, in his teens, find their lives haunted by evidence of a horrifying statistic: The leading cause of death among black males under the age of twenty-one is homicide. The boy who was once surrounded by a warm, loving African family is now looked upon with scorn by many whites and with a deep, aching fear by his fellow African-Americans that his life may be casually taken.Through the story of raising her son against the backdrop of a racially divided society, Golden confronts the causes of the violence that surrounds African-American men and reassesses the legacy of her own generation's struggle for civil rights. She talks to psychologists, writers, and young black men - criminals and scholars both - and explores how single black mothers are often blamed for troubled youth.In this fiercely lyrical and revealing narrative, Golden has created a work of profound and lasting importance: a book that sensitively and uniquely addresses the problems of boyhood and emerging manhood. This is a book in which mothers across the country will see themselves and their sons.",

        "Description": "He has been called the most trusted man in America. His 60-year-long journalistic career has spanned the Great Depression, several wars, and the extraordinary changes that have engulfed our nation over the last two-thirds of the 20th century. When Walter Cronkite advised his television audience in 1968 that the war in Vietnam could not be won, President Lyndon B. Johnson said: \"If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America.\"Now, at the age of eighty, Cronkite has written his life story--the personal and professional odyssey of the original \"anchorman\" for whom that very word was coined. As a witness to the crucial events of this century--first for the Houston Press, then for the United Press wire service, and finally for CBS in the fledgling medium of television--Cronkite set a standard for integrity, objectivity, enthusiasm, compassion, and insight that is difficult to surpass. He is an overflowing vessel of history, and a direct link with the people and places that have defined our nation and established its unique role in the world.But Walter Cronkite is also the man who loved to drive race cars \"for the same reason that others do exhibitionist, dangerous stunts. It sets us apart from the average man; puts us, in our own minds, on a level just a little above the chap who doesn't race.\" He is also the man whose \"softheartedness knows no rational bounds\" and who always had \"great problems at the theater, tearing up at the slightest offense against animals and people, notably the very old or the very young.\" He is the man who could barely refrain from spitting on the defendants at the Nuremberg Trials, and who could barely announce President Kennedy's assassination over the air for the sobs in his throat.Walter Cronkite helped launch the juggernaut of television, and tried to imbue it with his own respect for quality and ethics; but now he occupies a ringside seat during the decline of his profession and the ascent of the lowest common denominator. As he aptly observes, \"They'd rewrite Exodus to include a car chase.\" Still, the American people know the difference. They know that for decades they have had the privilege of getting their news from a gentleman of the highest caliber. And they will immensely enjoy A Reporter's Life.",

        "Description": "Java Examples in a Nutshell is chock full of practical real-world Java programming examples.  The author of the bestsellingJava in a Nutshell has created an entire book of example programs that you can learn from and modify for your own use.  If you learn best \"by example,\" this is the book for you.This book is a companion volume to Java in a Nutshell.  WhileJava in a Nutshell is a quick-reference at heart, it also includes an accelerated introduction to Java programming.  Java Examples in a Nutshell picks up where that book leaves off, providing a suite of example programs for novice Java programmers and experts alike.  This book doesn't hold your hand or supply detailed explanations of Java syntax or method calls; it simply delivers well-commented working examples that help you explore the wide range of what is possible with Java 1.1. Each chapter concludes with programming  exercises that suggest further avenues for building on what you have learned.Java Examples in a Nutshell contains all of the example programs  from the first edition of Java in a Nutshell, completely updated  for Java 1.1.  In addition, the I/O, networking, and GUI chapters have  been augmented to include even more practical examples. It also expands  on the examples from the second edition of Java in a Nutshell that  demonstrate the new features in Java 1.1, including the new AWT event  handling model, the JavaBeans API, internationalization, object serialization,  and reflection.In addition, this book provides never-before-published programming examples  for remote method invocation, database connectivity, and security -- important  elements of the Java Enterprise APIs. Finally, the book offers a glimpse of the features of \"Swing,\" the set of new components that are part of the forthcoming Java Foundation Classes (JFC).",

        "Description": "Beyond the headlines, Losing Jessica is Robby DeBoer's personal and very moving account of the battle to keep her baby daughter.On August 2, 1993, Robby and Jan DeBoer were forced to give up the little girl that they had raised, since infancy, for two and a half years. In a decision that shocked the entire country, the courts ruled that Jessi DeBoer was to be taken from the only parents and the only home she had ever known and given back to the biological parents who were virtual strangers to her.How do you say goodbye to your daughter?Losing Jessica is more than the story of a court battle. This is Robby's own story - of the hopes and dreams with which she and Jan began their marriage, and of the tremendous struggles that followed. Robby eloquently describes what it was like to meet her daughter for the first time, after years of trying to adopt. We feel her elation at the moment when she and Jan are awarded custody of the baby at the termination hearing, and we feel her pain and distress when she learns that the man who had signed the adoption papers might not be Jessi's biological father after all. Robby's story highlights the complications and inequities of a legal system that places the biological rights of birth parents above those of the adoptive parents - and makes decisions without regard to the best interests of the child. Above all, Losing Jessica is the story of a mother's unequivocal love for her child, the strongest, most compelling, and most unbreakable human bond of all.",

But while a rustic sign welcomes travelers with the motto \"A good place to visit - a great place to raise a family,\" Seward has suffered an inexplicable tragedy. A fifteen-year-old girl from the Island's most prominent family has been found brutally slain.It is a case that will start longtime resident Ginger Earley, a young, earnest detective, on a complex journey that will challenge her professionalism and her conscience.For Ginger and the police department, led by Ruben Martinez, a battle-weary, Mexican-born chief, the murder is baffling and frustrating. After months of exploring the life and death of Tara Breckenridge, Ginger and Ruben finally get what they need most: a suspect. He is an outspoken, liberal high school teacher who came to Seward from the East. He is also - and this is rare for Seward - a Jew.While building the case against Jerry Frankel, Ginger begins a relationship with Ruben that is at once forbidden and exhilarating. And as her personal life collides with her job as a detective, Ginger begins to have serious doubts about the work she is doing on the Breckenridge murder. Is she the heroine of Seward island - or part of a terrible rush to judgment? What is more important: to follow the explicit and implicit rules of a police officer or to obey the dictates of conscience she feels as a human being? And when and how does a community gather so much momentum against one man that the truth can be totally obscured?",

Gilda Radner came out of the Second City troupe in Toronto and joined the original cast of Saturday Night Live, the most influential comedy show on television. At SNL she created such memorable characters as Emily Litella and Roseanne Roseannadanna. She fell in love with Gene Wilder, and they married in 1984 with hopes of having a family. But in 1986, after persistent health problems and two miscarriages, Gilda was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.             Brave, funny, and painfully honest, It's Always Something is the story of Gilda's struggle against cancer and her determination to continue laughing. Cancer, she says, is about the most unfunny thing in the world. But Gilda's gutsy and unique sense of humor never deserts her as she talks about her life and describes two years of cancer therapy\u2014surgery, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, with all their side effects, including baldness. Gilda poignantly remembers her father's death from a brain tumor when she was only fourteen. She recalls the high and low points of her own career, including the magical early days of Saturday Night Live. She describes her transformation from star to cancer patient, and her rediscovery of her sense of humor at The Wellness Community, a dynamic caner-patient support program that gave her courage, hope, and the tools to participate in her own therapy. And she talks movingly about her emotional life-support system: her husband, Gene; her oldest girlfriends; her nurses; and Sparkle, her Yorkshire terrier.             Told as only Gilda could tell it, It's Always Something is the inspiring story of a courageous, funny woman fighting to enjoy life no matter what the circumstances. The twentieth-annversary edition includes a resource guide for people living with cancer, as well as tributes from Gilda's co-stars at Saturday Night Live.",

Abe Trillin had the western Missouri accent of someone who had grown up in St. Joseph and the dreams of America of someone who had been born is Russia. In Kansas City, he was a grocer, at least until he swore off the grocery business. He was given to swearing off things - coffee, tobacco, alcohol, all neckties that were not yellow in color. Presumably he had also sworn off swearing, although he was a collector of curses like \"May you have an injury that is not covered by workman's compensation.\" Although he had a strong vision of the sort of person he wanted his son to be, his explicit advice about how to behave didn't go beyond an almost lackadaisical \"You might as well be a mensch.\" Somehow, though, Abe Trillin's messages got through clearly. Fathers, sons, and admirers of Trillin's unerring sense of the American character will be entertained and touched by this quietly powerful memoir.",

        "Description": "A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEARIn 1985 Ari L. Goldman took a year\u2019s leave from his job as a religion reporter for The New York Times and enrolled in the Harvard Divinity School. What began as a project to deepen his knowledge of the world\u2019s sacred beliefs turned out to be an extraordinary journey of spiritual illumination, one in which Goldman reexamined his own faith as an Orthodox Jew and opened his mind to the great religions of the world.In his year at Harvard, Goldman found to his surprise that his fellow students were not straitlaced, somber clerics, but a diverse, vibrant, and sometimes embattled group from every major religion, united by their deep spiritual commitment. Even more surprising was the spiritual climate of the Divinity School itself: Far from being an ivory tower or a bastion of old-time Christian piety, the school was a forum for passionate debate on the relationships between religion and politics, social mores and sexuality.Written with warmth, humor, and penetrating clarity, The Search for God at Harvard is a book for anyone who has wrestled with the question of what it means to take religion seriously today.Praise for The Search for God at Harvard:\u201cPersonal yet informative, warm and humorous, beautifully written. In a word, superb.\u201d\u2013Elie Wiesel\u201cIs it possible to honor the truth of one\u2019s own religion while being genuinely open to others? In The Search for God at Harvard, Ari Goldman tells his story in so fine a manner that he helps us to understand why the answer must be yes.\u201d\u2013The New York Times Book Review\u201cExcellent: intelligent, informative, infused with humor.\u201d\u2013Cleveland Plain Dealer\u201cEnriching . . . well-written, absorbing.\u201d\u2013The Boston Globe\u201cA valuable and unique contribution.\u201d\u2013The Washington Post Book World",

His best friend thinks he's a role model. His boss thinks he's a good soldier.This weekend's run should be business as usual - guns for money, money for guns - moving the product north on the Iron Highway from Dirty City to Manhattan. But this weekend is going to teach Burdon something he doesn't yet know about who he is...and isn't. When the meet in Manhattan turns into a five-alarm fire and an all-out war on the tenth floor of a New York hotel, there is only one way out: an uneasy alliance with a hard case named Jinx and the street gang known as the U Street Crew. And once the heat is on, with a cadre of killers and every police officer and Federal agent on the eastern seaboard on their tail, Burdon gets the chilling sensation that, one way or another, this so-called milk run may be his last.",

        "Description": "An astonishing story of bravery and honor: One man's quest -- against incredible odds -- to pursue justice . . . and to uncover the painful truths of his own background.From the sagging row houses of Paterson, New Jersey, to the cocaine fields of Colombia, from the razor wire of Rikers Island to the streets of New York City, Bernard Kerik has dedicated his life to a single goal: to fight the injustice he sees around him. A jail warden with a black belt and a background in international security and anti-terrorism, he took a substantial pay cut to become a beat cop on the streets of Times Square in 1986. A fearless narcotics detective, he went undercover to buy drugs in Harlem, seized millions of dollars of cocaine from the drug lords of the Cali cartel, and was awarded the Police Department's Medal of Valor for saving the life of a fellow officer. In the 1990s, as the city's Commissioner of Correction, he ended the hellish violence at Rikers Island and transformed it into a model of its kind. Today, as Kerik directs a police force of 55,000 -- the largest municipal force in the world -- his battles continue.And yet Bernard Kerik's greatest battle was not pitched on tough city streets, but within himself. For, even as he was driven to seek justice in every corner of the world, this extraordinary man never looked back until he reached the top. And when he did, he faced the greatest unsolved case of his life -- the tragic mystery of his own mother, who abandoned her young son forty-one years ago.The odyssey of Bernard B. Kerik is a poignant tale with lessons for all about what it means to be a good and brave man, and just how each of us should aspire to those ideals. A testament to courage in the service of honor, The Lost Son is a harrowing, inspirational, and uniquely American story.",
