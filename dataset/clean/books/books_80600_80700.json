Each of these fascinating feats appears to be the work of magical forces, but their true secret lies in mathematical manipulations. Correctly guess the age of any volunteer. Startle a stranger with knowledge about his or her life. Read minds, make accurate predictions, perform lightning-quick calculations, and demonstrate seemingly mystical powers of memory. Perform extraordinary effects with cards, dice, pencil and paper (and occasionally a calculator). In all of these tricks, the mathematical principle is well-concealed, and in many of them the use of numbers isn't even suspected. For each trick, an explanation of why it works is included in order to help you better understand the principle behind it, as well as to enable you to make your own variations on the trick or to develop other tricks on your own. Suggestions are given for what to say when introducing a trick so as to heighten suspense, increase sur prise, and keep your audience as confounded as possible. No sleight of hand is used, but with your brain power as your \"magic wand,\" you'll have fun entertaining, amazing, and confusing people for hours.  96 pages, 51 b/w illus., 5 3/8 x 8 1/4.

        "Description": "The girls' guide to giving the cosmetics industry a makeover.  Lead in lipstick? 1,4 dioxane in baby soap? Coal tar in shampoo? How is this possible?  Simple. The $35 billion cosmetics industry is so powerful that they've kept themselves unregulated for decades.  Not one cosmetic product has to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration before hitting the market.  Incredible? Consider this:  The European Union has banned more than 1,100 chemicals from cosmetics. The United States has banned just 10.  Only 11% of chemicals used in cosmetics in the US have been assessed for health and safety \u2013 leaving a staggering 89% with unknown or undisclosed effects.  More than 70% of all personal care products may contain phthalates, which are linked to birth defects and infertility.  Many baby soaps are contaminated with the cancer-causing chemical 1,4 dioxane.  It's not just women who are affected by this chemists' brew. Shampoo, deodorant, face lotion and other products used daily by men, women and children contain hazardous chemicals that the industry claims are \"within acceptable limits.\" But there's nothing acceptable about daily multiple exposures to carcinogenic chemicals-from products that are supposed to make us feel healthy and beautiful.  Not Just a Pretty Face  delves deeply into the dark side of the beauty industry, and looks to hopeful solutions for a healthier future. This scathing investigation peels away less-than-lovely layers to expose an industry in dire need of an extreme makeover.  15 percent of the purchase price of each book sold benefits the national Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, administered by the Breast Cancer Fund, through December 31, 2012.",

Basil Pennington, the well-known spiritual writer, addresses this question by using Peter, the first of the Apostles, as the prime example of the maturing follower of Christ. Through Peter, he demonstrates, the Gospel takes on an immediacy and relevance that is unique -- and from which the contemporary Christian can learn a valuable lesson. Peter's spiritual awakening and growth points the way for us to live out our call, with its inevitable challenges, frustrations, and occasional failures. Jesus calls us, as He did the first Apostles, into a special filial relationship with Him. \"It is our life's work,\" Pennington writes, \"to learn to think and act in accord with who we are by creation and by the recreation of baptism.\"  DAILY WE FOLLOW HIM will be of great help to anyone struggling with the demands of faith, built on the premise that we are all called to be disciples, called to give Christian witness in our everyday life. Pennington's spiritual reflections enable us to respond to that call in the only way possible.",

At least until the DNA tests reveal that blood at the crime scene can only be Malone's.Did Malone do it?

        "Authors": "By Balakian, Peter",
        "Description": "\u201cHis visions are burning\u2026his poetry heartbreaking,\u201d wrote Elie Wiesel of American poet Peter Balakian. Now, in elegant prose, the prize-winning poet who James Dickey called \u201can extraordinary talent\u201d has written a compelling memoir about growing up American in a family that was haunted by a past too fraught with terror to be spoken of openly.Black Dog of Fate is set in the affluent New Jersey suburbs where Balakian\u2014the firstborn son of his generation\u2014grew up in a close, extended family. At the center of what was a quintessential American baby boom childhood lay the dark specter of a trauma his forebears had experienced\u2014the Ottoman Turkish government\u2019s extermination of more than a million Armenians in 1915, the century\u2019s first genocide. In a story that climaxes to powerful personal and moral revelations, Balakian traces the complex process of discovering the facts of his people\u2019s history and the horrifying aftermath of the Turkish government\u2019s campaign to cover up one of the worst crimes ever committed against humanity.In describing his awakening to the facts of history, Balakian introduces us to a remarkable family of matriarchs and merchants, physicians, a bishop, and his aunts, two well-known figures in the world of literature. The unforgettable central figure of the story is Balakian\u2019s grandmother, a survivor and widow of the Genocide who speaks in fragments of metaphor and myth as she cooks up Armenian delicacies, plays the stock market, and keeps track of the baseball stats of her beloved Yankees. The book is infused with the intense and often comic collision between this family\u2019s ancient Near Eastern traditions and the American pop culture of the \u201950s and \u201960s.Balakian moves with ease from childhood memory, to history, to his ancestors\u2019 lives, to the story of a poet\u2019s coming of age. Written with power and grace, Black Dog of Fate unfolds like a tapestry its tale of survival against enormous odds. Through the eyes of a poet, here is the arresting story of a family\u2019s journey from its haunted past to a new life in a new world.",

This coolly\u00a0reasoned polemic influenced religious thinking throughout the world at the dawn of the nineteenth century, and its resonance remains undiminished by time. The selfsame humanist and egalitarian views that made Paine a popular figure of the American Revolution brought him into frequent conflict with political authorities. Parts of\u00a0The Age of Reason were written in a French jail, where Paine was confined for his opposition\u00a0to the execution of Louis XVI. An atack on revealed religion from the deist point of view \u2014 embodied by Paine's credo, \"I believe in one God, and no more\" \u2014 this work undertakes a hitherto unheard-of approach\u00a0to Bible study. Its critical and objective examination of Old and New Testatments cites nemerous contradictions as evidence\u00a0against literal interpretations of the text. Well articulated and eminently readable, The Age of Reason is a classic of free thought.",

        "Description": "Money has great power in our lives. Used wisely, it is one key to accomplishing our goals, providing for our needs, and fulfilling our life purpose. In recent years, many of us ignored the wisdom of the past when it came to managing and spending our money. Credit card debt soared, savings rates plummeted, and our home equity became something to be tapped into and spent rather than a source of security in retirement. We felt an insatiable desire for more. And we found ourselves spending tomorrow\u2019s money today in order to have what we hoped would satisfy. The result of all of this was not greater happiness and satisfaction, but greater stress and anxiety.Enough is an invitation to rediscover the Bible\u2019s wisdom when it comes to prudent financial practices. In these pages are found the keys to experiencing contentment, overcoming fear, and discovering joy through simplicity and generosity. This book could change your life, by changing your relationship with money.\u201cWe Americans love our stuff. We\u2019re living in a fast-paced, me-first, instant-gratification world, and it\u2019s finally catching up to us. Debt is out of control, homes are in foreclosure ... even banks are going out of business. What the world needs today is the message of contentment and simplicity, and that\u2019s exactly what Pastor Adam Hamilton delivers in Enough.\u201dDave Ramsey, New York Times Best-Selling Author and Nationally Syndicated Radio Talk Show Host\u201cOnce again, Adam Hamilton is leading the church; \u2018Enough is enough\u2019 was once a Wesleyan watchword. Adam breathes new life into the Wesleyan commitment to simplicity. Amid a culture of greed and conspicuous consumption Adam calls us to a biblically based, evangelical joy of having the faith to say \u2018enough is enough.\u2019\u201dBishop Will WillimonUnited Methodist Church, Birmingham Area\u201cI pay close attention to whatever Adam Hamilton writes. His books are marked by extraordinary pastoral insight, biblical and theological depth, courage to speak the truth, and down-to-earth practicality. Enough comes like an antidote in the middle of a pandemic. I hope that classes, groups, couples, and individuals will use this book\u2014and the economic crisis it addresses\u2014as a challenge to get healthy again by deepening our discipleship in the vital area of money and possessions.\u201dBrian McLaren, Author/Networker (brianmclaren.net)",
