        "Title": "Cuban Communism",

        "Description": "\"Cuban Communism remains, like its previous ten editions, an important contribution to the field of Cuban Studies. It includes many useful chronological facts, as well as a selection of Fidel Castro's speeches which are interesting and informative for any reader interested in the island.\" -- Maria Gropas, Department of Social Anthropology, University of Cambridge  This new 11th edition of a classic text, come to be known as \"the bible of Cuban Studies,\" emphasizes two key issues of the twenty-first century. First, transition concerns in a world without Castro, and second, the continuing embargo of Cuba by the United States in the aftermath of a major change in the presidency. Cuban Communism has been updated to take account of changes in the 44 years of Castro's rule since seizing power in 1959. In addition to articles and essays that represent new developments in Cuba, the work boasts a database upgrade that makes it more important to students, scholars, and researchers.  The volume has expanded the section on future prospects for civil society and democracy in a post-Castro environment; including \"Regime Change in Cuba\" by Eusebio Mujal-Leon and Joshua W. Busby; \"Transition Scenarios\" by Randolph H. Pherson, and \"A Policy Conundrum over Cuba\" by Edward Gonzalez. It also contains a chronology of events from 1959 through 2002. Finally, the new work contains a carefully constructed Who's Who of important players in Cuba and the regime during the Castro period up to the present.  Other articles new to the 11th edition of Cuban Communism are by Ernesto Betancourt, \"Cuba's Balance of Payment Gap\"; Carmelo Mesa-Lago, \"The Cuban Economy From 1999-2001\"; Taylor Boas, \"The Internet and U.S. Policy toward Cuba\"; Aldo M. Leiva, \"Environmental Technology Transfer and Foreign Investment\"; Moises Asis, \"Judaism in Cuba\"; Wolf Grabendorff, \"A View from the European Union.\" More than ever, it is a must volume for those interested in political systems and social structures.  Irving Louis Horowitz is Hannah Arendt Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Sociology and Political Science at Rutgers University. Among his works are Three Worlds of Development, Beyond Empire and Revolution, and his Bacardi Lectures on Cuba that was published as The Conscience of Worms and the Cowardice of Lions.  Jaime Suchlicki is Bacardi Professor of History at the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Miami, and executive director of its Cuban-American and Cuban Center. He is author of From Columbus to Castro, University Students and Revolution in Cuba, and Mexico: From Montezuma to Nafta and Beyond.",

Twenty years later, after having helped shape America's culinary revolution, Hay Day presents 250 of the recipes that keep its customers coming back again and again. Reflecting its passion for quality, freshness, inventiveness, and character, The Hay Day Country Market Cookbook mirrors the way the country cooks and eats today. It's not about trends or gimmicks, but about ingredients and a love for sound, deep, palate-pleasing flavor. About the delicious simplicity of Veal Chops in Mustard Sauce, the tangy surprise of Lemon Chevre Chicken, the perfection of the perfect Maryland Crab Cake. It's about the sophisticated--Wilted Radicchio with Gorgonzola and Walnuts--and the down-to-earth--Chunky Tomato and Bacon Soup. And it's about the integrity of cooking in concert with the seasons--New Potatoes and Fiddlehead Ferns in spring, Grilled Duck with Citrus Cherry Relish in summer, Wild Rice and Cranberries in fall, Rosy Root Vegetable Chili for the dead of winter. Now even without a Hay Day in town, you can still get the best market-based, seasonal dishes around.",

        "Description": "In this important book, Dr. Laura Schlessinger shows men and women that they can have a Good Life no matter how Bad their Childhood.For each of us, there is a connection between our early family dynamics and experiences  and our current attitudes and decisions. Many of the people Dr. Laura has helped did not realize how their histories impacted their adult lives, or how their choices in people, repetitive situations, and decisions -- even their emotional reactions -- were connected to those early negative experiences, playing a major role in their current unhappiness.For these people and millions like them, too much time is dedicated to repeating the ugly dynamics of childhood in a vain attempt to repair or cope with deep hurt and longings. Too often they use their emotional pain to control others or excuse their own inappropriate and destructive behaviors. Some turn to therapy, only to find themselves trapped in their self-pitying victim mode, robbed of optimism, confidence, and growth.Dr. Laura will help you realize that no matter what circumstances you came from or currently live in, you are ultimately responsible for how you react to them. The acceptance of this basic truth is the source of your power to secure the Good Life you long for. In her signature straightforward style, with real-life examples, Dr. Laura shows you what you will gain by not being satisfied with an identity as a victim, or even as a survivor -- but striving to be a victor!In Bad Childhood -- Good Life, Dr. Laura will guide you to accept the truth of the assaults on your psyche and soul, understand your unique coping style and how it impacts your daily thoughts and actions, and help you embrace a life of more peace and happiness.Bad Childhood -- Good Life comes from a compassionate and personal place.  Dr. Laura also reveals some of her own experiences with a difficult childhood and what efforts it took to attain a Good Life.  She writes, \"My resilience has paid off, and I'm doing the best I can with what I've got.\" Now you can, too.",

        "Description": "There is a serious information gap for Webmasters learning client-side JavaScript skills and trying to solve common Web-related problems. Knowing the syntax is one thing, being able to build a useful application is another. And while there are dozens of \"how- to\" JavaScript books available, few literally hand the Webmaster a set of ready-to-go, client-side JavaScript applications with thorough documentation that enable the reader to fully understand and extend those applications. By providing such a set of applications, JavaScript Application Cookbook allows Webmasters to immediately add extra functionality to their Web sites.This book targets readers with two different skill sets. The primary target is JavaScript-knowledgeable Webmasters and  designers who can immediately begin constructing their own  versions of the applications. The secondary target is those with little or no JavaScript experience. The included  applications are ready for immediate use and require little  customization.This book explores both the code and the techniques that are centered around core JavaScript functionality, a functionality  that will not become incompatible or obsolete. The source file  design of most applications and libraries will help modularize  reader Web sites and facilitate easier site management and coding  practices.Chapters are organized by application. Among the included  applications are:A client-side search engine that will show coders how to build their own search engine and get excellent results, all with a client-side toolA drag-and-drop greeting application that lets users custom build and send DHTML email greetingsA GUI image rollover tool that generates cross-browser image rollover code for all versions of JavaScriptA robust client-side shopping cart application that lets shoppers browse and shop, while the application keeps a tab of the shopper's selections and a running bill, including tax and shippingAn online test application that auto-administers, grades, and displays answers to online exams or surveysAn additional value to this book is an online resource www.serve.com that discusses the applications  and points to other resources. With its focus on providing practical real-world solutions for Webmasters, JavaScript  Application Cookbook is destined to become a staple for every JavaScript developer, regardless of experience.",

Here are American families who can no longer pay their medical bills, who\u2019ve lost high-wage-earning jobs to NAFTA. And here are white supremacists who claim common ground with progressives. Maharidge\u2019s approach is rigorously historical, creating a tapestry of today as it is lived in America, a self-portrait that is shockingly different from what we\u2019re used to seeing and yet which rings of truth.Dale Maharidge is among the very few American journalists attempting to describe the full range of the American experience. Together with Michael Williamson, who\u2019s produced several other important books about the other America, including their first book together, Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass, based on a three-year journey through homeless encampments from coast to coast, and The Last Great American Hobo. Journey to Nowhere inspired Bruce Springsteen to write two of the songs on his album The Ghost of Tom Joad, including \"Youngstown,\" based on a conversation between Maharidge and two former steelworkers, and \"New Timer.\" And Their Children After Them won the Pulitzer Prize in 1990. Maharidge has been a visiting professor of journalism at Columbia University and Stanford. Maharidge was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1998. He now lives in Northern California.Michael Williamson is a photographer for the Washington Post with numerous honors including the World Press Photo and Nikon World Understanding Through Photography awards.",

In his debut collection of essays, Rakoff uses his razor-sharp wit and snarky humor to deliver a barrage of damaging blows that, more often than not, land squarely on his own jaw\u2013hilariously satirizing the writer, not the subject. Joining the wry and the heartfelt, Fraud offers an object lesson in not taking life, or ourselves, too seriously.",

The result is an abundant assortment of verbal and visual images that reveals the universal fascination with fathers and their relationships with children as a subject in literature and art.Biographical notes give the reader background information on the artists and writers represented in Fathers and Children.",

        "Title": "You're Wearing That?: Understanding Mothers and Daughters in Conversation",
        "Authors": "By Tannen, Deborah",
        "Description": "Deborah Tannen's #1 New York Times bestseller You Just Don\u2019t Understand revolutionized communication between women and men. Now, in her most provocative and engaging book to date, she takes on what is potentially the most fraught and passionate connection of women\u2019s lives: the mother-daughter relationship.It was Tannen who first showed us that men and women speak different languages. Mothers and daughters speak the same language\u2013but still often misunderstand each other, as they struggle to find the right balance between closeness and independence. Both mothers and daughters want to be seen for who they are, but tend to see the other as falling short of who she should be. Each overestimates the other\u2019s power and underestimates her own. Why do daughters complain that their mothers always criticize, while mothers feel hurt that their daughters shut them out? Why do mothers and daughters critique each other on the Big Three\u2013hair, clothes, and weight\u2013while longing for approval and understanding? And why do they scrutinize each other for reflections of themselves?  Deborah Tannen answers these and many other questions as she explains why a remark that would be harmless coming from anyone else can cause an explosion when it comes from your mother or your daughter. She examines every aspect of this complex dynamic, from the dark side that can shadow a woman throughout her life, to the new technologies like e-mail and instant messaging that are transforming mother-daughter communication. Most important, she helps mothers and daughters understand each other, the key to improving their relationship.With groundbreaking insights, pitch-perfect dialogues, and deeply moving memories of her own mother, Tannen untangles the knots daughters and mothers can get tied up in. Readers will appreciate Tannen\u2019s humor as they see themselves on every page and come away with real hope for breaking down barriers and opening new lines of communication. Eye-opening and heartfelt, You\u2019re Wearing That? illuminates and enriches one of the most important relationships in our lives.\u201cTannen analyzes and decodes scores of conversations between moms and daughters. These exchanges are so real they can make you squirm as you relive the last fraught conversation you had with your own mother or daughter. But Tannen doesn't just point out the pitfalls of the mother-daughter relationship, she also provides guidance for changing the conversations (or the way that we feel about the conversations) before they degenerate into what Tannen calls a mutually aggravating spiral, a \"self-perpetuating cycle of escalating responses that become provocations.\" \u2013 The San Francisco Chronicle",
