        "Description": "The 100-foot promontory known as Pointe du Hoc -- where six big German guns were ensconced -- was the number one target of the heavy U.S. and British warships poised in the English Channel on D-Day morning. Facing arguably the toughest task to befall U.S. forces during the war, the brave men of the Army 2nd Ranger Battalion boldly took control of the fortified cliff and set in motion the liberation of Europe.Based upon recently released documents, here is the first in-depth, anecdotal remembrance of these fearless Army Rangers. Acclaimed author and historian Douglas Brinkley deftly moves between events four decades apart to tell two riveting stories: the making of Ronald Reagan's historic 1984 speeches about the storming of the Normandy coast and the actual heroic event that inspired them and helped to end the Second World War.",

Schildt understands this and gets right to the point in this fast-paced, no-nonsense guide to learning C++.As you may already know, C++ is built on the foundation of C.

Schildt's clear instructions, practical examples, and valuable tips put this book in a class by itself.Written in the clear, uncompromising style that has made Schildt's programming books the choice of millions worldwide, C++ from the Ground Up starts with an overview of C++ and the general form of a C++ program. You'll then progress to the fundamentals of C++ programming, including control statements, operators, variables, expressions, and data types.From this foundation, you'll then delve into functions; pointers and references; classes and objects; function and operator overloading; constructors and destructors; templates; exception handling; inheritance; virtual functions; the C++ I/O system; the preprocessor; the principles behind Object-Oriented Programming (OOP); and much, much more.Unlike other C++ programming books, C++ from the Ground Up adheres to the draft ANSI C++ standard, so you will be learning the most up-to-date specification of C++, the version supported by all major C++ compilers. Therefore, what you learn today will still apply tomorrow.If you're ready to start using the power and versatility of C++ - whether you program in DOS, Windows, OS/2, Unix, or any other operating system - Schildt's C++ from the Ground Up is the ideal book for you.",

And within the history of the scorecard are some of baseball's greatest moments. From the first scorecard introduced in 1845, to the scoring system devised by direct-marketing genius L. L. Bean; from presidential scoring habits to batting titles decided by official scorers to Phil Rizzuto's inspired scoring symbol \"WW,* Dickson delights in his subject. Henry Chadwick (the inventor of the scorecard), Ty Cobb, Mel Allen and Red Barber, FDR and Ike, concessionaire Harry M. Stevens, California Angels' official scorer, Ed Munson, and many others all play their parts in this history.Among this book's many illustrations is a gallery of historic scorecards, some of them from baseball's most memorable contests, including Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Babe Ruth's \"called\" home run, and Cal Ripken's record-breaking 2,131st consecutive game. In addition, Dickson provides basic and advanced scoring techniques for fans who record the games they see, a year-by-year timeline of rule changes, a guide to baseball's quirkiest statutes, stories of famous scoring blunders, and many more unexpected rewards.For those who keep or have kept score, this book will be an elixir. For those who haven't, it will be a revelation. For baseball fans everywhere, it will be a treasure.",

What kind of nation are we becoming? I fear it's the very kind the Colonists fought against.But perhaps most of all, we are fed up because deep down we know how great America has always been, how many great things the people do in spite of their government, and how great the nation can be in the future if government will just get out of the way.Our fight is clear. We must step up and retake the reins of our government from a Washington establishment that has abused our trust. We must empower states to fight for our beliefs, elect only leaders who are on our team, set out to remind our fellow Americans why liberty is guaranteed in the Constitution, and take concrete steps to take back our country.

        "Authors": "By Bourne, Edmund J., Brownstein, Arlen, and Garano, Lorna",
        "Description": "Twenty-five million Americans suffer from diagnosable anxiety disorder, and our cultural climate seems to breed more apprehension and fear with each passing day. It is no surprise that international pharmaceutical companies spend billions each year to research and develop psychoactive drugs that counter psychological symptoms. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any magic pill for people who are chronically anxious. Successful treatments that rely on drugs have an extremely high incidence of relapse, and the side effects of most prescription anti-anxiety drugs are as debilitating as the disorder itself.From the best-selling author of The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook and a naturopathic physician, this book helps you develop a treatment strategy for anxiety that is totally drug-free. The authors begin with an introduction to healthy lifestyle choices. Then they discuss a variety of conditions that can aggravate anxiety-related problems. They provide an overview of complimentary approaches to anxiety treatment using herbs and supplements, massage, chiropractic, and homeopathy. In later chapters, learn about controlling body toxicity.",

When a series of attacks on animal researchers leave several people dead, the government\u2014including the President\u2014issues an immediate ban on animal testing. And that\u2019s when the real trouble begins\u2026At the heart of the action are two government agents, the dashing Commander \u201cCamp\u201d Campbell, a man as decorated for his bravery in Iraq as for his own self-professed charm. Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Raines is the more practical of the two, a woman defined by her dedication to rules.   Camp has returned to the States, newly reassigned to a government-funded test site. When the ban on animals comes down, Camp pulls a restless act by making off with two hundred rats\u2026and winds up in deep trouble. He is immediately banished for a year, his superiors hoping the ramifications of his stunt will have worn off by then. Raines, uncharacteristically covering for him, finds herself joining him. But where they are headed only increases the risk\u2014both to themselves, to the scientist whose very existence is threatened\u2026and the future of the human race. Who is really behind the ban on animal testing? And why? Could a deadly, dangerous fanatical group be behind the threat of a new vein of plague sweeping across the country\u2026or worse, could it be someone people have come to trust?",

Truscott was an American military giant: tough, resourceful, and devoted to the men under his command. Unlike the more flamboyant high-ranking European field commanders of the time, he was neither arrogant nor in pursuit of personal glory-but rather a loyal, humble man who led his troops from the front and fought every enemy with a tenacity that made him one of the most respected and revered commanders in the U.S. Army. In Command of Honor, author H. Paul Jeffers chronicles the life of this American hero. For the first time, the life of Truscott is revealed: his ramshackle childhood in Texas and Oklahoma, his extraordinary combat service, and his peacetime duties. But above all, this is a story of leadership and sacrifice by a man who lived for duty, honor, and courage-a man who would become a legend in the annals of U.S. Army history.",

        "Description": "Becoming a Literacy Leader chronicles the work of Jennifer Allen, an elementary teacher who moved to a new school and a new job as a literacy specialist, and found herself tackling everything from teacher study groups to state-mandated assessment plans.  The book is rooted  in Jennifer's  belief that teachers know what they need when it comes to professional development in literacy, and the best literacy leaders are those who listen to and respect the educators in their midst. Grounded in research but thoroughly practical, Jennifer shares advice on:organizing a literacy room with resources for classroom teachers, including book lists, bins of children's books tied to craft and strategy lessons, bulletin board ideas, and files with instructional materials;developing intervention classrooms for struggling readers and writers built on collaboration between teachers and literacy specialists;setting up assessment notebooks for teachers, and preparing new and veteran teachers for student assessments across grades;creating model programs for dealing with schoolwide problems like reading fluency, and then moving from the pilot to implementation in many classrooms;coaching new and veteran teachers in the latest literacy practices, without taking on the role of expert;analyzing and using books, videos and journals in professional development programs;infusing routine staff meetings with discussions of new literacy curricula;leading teacher study groups using a variety of formats;finding and budgeting money for professional development programs in literacy;protecting time and scheduling priorities, to ensure the literacy specialist position doesn't become a &#147;catch-all\u201d for the random needs of teachers or administrators.At a time when all administrators are urged to be literacy leaders, this insider's view helps to define what leadership looks like and shows how to create an environment that fosters professional development.  Jennifer Allen shares the balance leaders struggle with, as they strive to support and honor the fine practices of teachers, even as they nudge colleagues to improve their literacy instruction.  Ultimately, Becoming a Literacy Leader is a hopeful book, an optimistic and realistic portrait of life in schools among teachers committed to doing their jobs well.",

        "Description": "A medical mistake during an IVF procedure. An unthinkable situation . . . you\u2019re pregnant with the wrong baby. You can terminate, but you can\u2019t keep him. What choice would you make?Carolyn and Sean Savage had been trying to expand their family for years. When they underwent an IVF transfer in February 2009, they knew it would be their last chance. If they became pregnant, they would celebrate the baby as an answer to their prayers. If not, they would be grateful for the family they had and leave their fertility struggles behind forever.They never imagined a third option. The pregnancy test was positive, but the clinic had transferred the wrong embryos. Carolyn was pregnant with someone else\u2019s baby.The Savages faced a series of heartbreaking decisions: terminate the pregnancy, sue for custody, or hand over the infant to his genetic parents upon delivery. Knowing that Carolyn was carrying another couple\u2019s hope for a baby, the Savages wanted to do what they prayed the other family would do for them if the situation was reversed. Sean and Carolyn Savage decided to give the ultimate gift, the gift of life, to a family they didn\u2019t know, no strings attached.Inconceivable provides an inside look at how modern medicine, which creates miracles daily, could allow such a tragic mistake, and the many legal ramifications that ensued with both the genetic family and the clinic. Chronicling their tumultuous pregnancy and its aftermath, which tested the Savage\u2019s faith, their relationship to their church, and their marriage, Inconceivable is ultimately a testament to love. Carolyn and Sean loved this baby, making it impossible for them to imagine how they could give him life and then give him away.In the end, Inconceivable is a story of what it is to be a parent, someone who nurtures a life, protects a soul, only to release that child into the world long before you\u2019re ready to let him go.",
