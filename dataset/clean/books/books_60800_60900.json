But in 2001, working his way from the minors to the majors, all of the plans for Josh went off the rails in a moment of weakness.  What followed was a 4-year nightmare of drugs and alcohol, estrangement from friends and family, and his eventual suspension from baseball.

But it is also the memoir of a spiritual journey that breaks through pain and heartbreak and leads to the rebirth of his major-league career.Josh Hamilton makes no excuses and places no blame on anyone other than himself.  He takes responsibility for his poor decisions and believes his story can help millions who battle the same demons.  \"I have been given a platform to tell my story\" he says. \"I pray every night I am a good messenger.\"",

Nina has just received a last-minute call from her old boss and mentor in Monterey County, California, where she is enjoying the breathtaking scenery and spending time with her boyfriend, P.I. Paul van Wagoner.  Klaus Pohlmann is in desperate straits and begs Nina to take over a seemingly unwinnable case: A luckless two-time felon named Stefan Wyatt has robbed a grave and made off with the long-buried bones of a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9. When he is caught and arrested, further devastating evidence found in the grave suggests that Stefan is guilty of a far more deadly crime.A young woman, a classmate of Stefan\u2019s, has been killed, and he is accused of her murder.  Now, as a result of California\u2019s Third Strike law, Wyatt is looking at twenty-five years to life whether he\u2019s convicted of grand theft or murder. Either way, he\u2019s in big trouble. With her client\u2019s blood DNA found in the dead woman\u2019s apartment, Nina faces an uphill battle. Suspecting that her hapless client has been set up, Nina brings in a brilliant forensic pathologist who comes up with a startling theory about the case that could rewrite a crucial page of European history. As the evidence mounts against Nina\u2019s client, Paul launches his own investigation into the shadowy past of the two-decades-old skeleton. But long-held secrets nearly get him killed and reveal a more insidious evil at work\u2014and an extraordinary story dating back to tsarist Russia and the Romanov court. As Wyatt edges closer to the unluckiest verdict of his young life, Nina makes an astounding discovery that just might save her client\u2014or expose a killer who could bury them all. Brilliantly  imagined  and  compulsively  readable,  Unlucky in Law  is a beguiling mix of wrenching drama and gripping action.

        "Title": "Virginia at War, 1862",
        "Authors": "By Davis, William C. (EDT) and Robertson, James I. (EDT)",
        "Description": "As the Civil War entered its first full calendar year for the Old Dominion, Virginians began to experience the full ramifications of the conflict. Their expectations for the coming year did not prepare them for what was about to happen; in 1862 the war became earnest and real, and the state became then and thereafter the major battleground of the war in the East. Virginia emerged from the year 1861 in much the same state of uncertainty and confusion as the rest of the Confederacy. While the North was known to be rebuilding its army, no one could be sure if the northern people and government were willing to continue the war. The landscape and the people of Virginia were a part of the battlefield. Virginia at War, 1862 demonstrates how no aspect of life in the Commonwealth escaped the war's impact. The collection of essays examines topics as diverse as daily civilian life and the effects of military occupation, the massive influx of tens of thousands of wounded and sick into Richmond, and the wartime expansion of Virginia's industrial base, the largest in the Confederacy. Out on the field, Robert E. Lee's army was devastated by the Battle of Antietam, and Lee strove to rebuild the army with recruits from the interior of the state. Many Virginians, however, were far behind the front lines. A growing illustrated press brought the war into the homes of civilians and allowed them to see what was happening in their state and in the larger war beyond their borders. To round out this volume, indefatigable Richmond diarist Judith McGuire continues her day-by-day reflections on life during wartime. The second in a five-volume series examining each year of the war, Virginia at War, 1862 illuminates the happenings on both homefront and battlefield in the state that served as the crucible of America's greatest internal conflict.",

Dallas narrates in meticulous detail the conflicts, contradictions, motives, and counter-motives that marked the end of the greatest military conflict in modern history and established lasting patterns of deceit, uncertainty, and distrust out of which the Cold War was born.Beginning with the siege of Berlin, Dallas describes in simple human terms the interactions of Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Hitler, Zhukov, Truman, de Gaulle, Macmillan, along with others relatively unknown, vividly portraying the interpenetration of the daily with the epochal, the obscure with the great political events taking place on the world stage. A grand narrative of diplomatic mistakes, military accidents, and the chaos inherent in human affairs,1945 draws the reader into a profound reflection on the basic shaping forces of history, the arbitrary ways we objectify its conflicts, and the subtle, almost invisible filaments that enmesh public events with private passions.",

The material is organized into thematic chapters bearing the titles: Irrepressible Conflict, Gathering Momentum, War in the East, Wartime Politics, Wan on the Water, Fighting for Freedom, Turning points, Army Life, War in the West, Behind the Lines, Valor and Sacrifice, and An Uneasy Peace. Oddly, a rather minor feature of the book is announced in the subtitle: each of the 365 textual pages includes a one-sentence reference to a significant event of a particular day during one of the years of the war.

        "Description": "The controversial bestseller that caused huge waves in the UK! The Independent calls it \"required reading.\" Noam Chomsky says it \"contains valuable information that we should know, over here, for our own good, and the world's.\" We call it our biggest book so far and will be backing it from day one with guaranteed coop spending, a national publicity and review blitz, talk radio bookings, various retail sales aids including postcards, and of course the usual full court press on the Web and via email.This is NOT just another 9/11 book: it is the book for those of us trying to understand why America--and Americans--are targets for hate. Many people do hate America, in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa, as well as in the Middle East. Ziauddin Sardar and Merryl Wyn Davies explore the global impact of America's foreign policy and its corporate and cultural power, placing this unprecedented dominance in the context of America's own perception of itself. In doing so, they consider TV and the Hollywood machine as a mirror which reflects both the American Dream and the American Nightmare. Their analysis provides an important contribution to a debate which needs to be addressed by people of all nations, cultures, religions and political persuasions--and especially by Americans.Described by The Times Higher Education Supplement as \"packed with tightly argued points,\" the book is carefully researched and built to withstand the inevitable criticism that will be aimed at it. A book that some reviewers will love to hate and others will praise for its insights, it's guaranteed to cause a stir.",

With her sharp insight and uncensored observations of the mating rituals of the Manhattan elite, Bushnell has become a celebrity in her own right\u2014on television, on the newsstands, and in bookstores across the globe.In a new collection of stories, 4 Blondes, the romantic intrigues, betrayals, victories, and insecurities of four modern women are told with Bushnell's keen wit and sardonic eye. A beautiful B-list model in \"Nice N'Easy\" attaches herself yearly to the man with the largest summer house in the Hamptons, but she soon realizes that snagging a rich man and living in a fancy beach house won't necessarily bring her happiness. In \"Highlights (for Adults),\" a high-powered magazine columnist doesn't feel that she needs a man; an examination of her deteriorating marriage shows that her literary journalist husband could never live up to her sexual or emotional expectations. Too many expectations overwhelm Princess Cecilia in \"Platinum\"; her marriage to \"the world's most eligible bachelor\" leads to a descent into paranoia that she chronicles in her journal. And in \"Single Process,\" an aging \"It girl\" worries that she is getting too old to meet a local eligible bachelor, so she travels to London in search of a husband, where she makes pithy observations about the differences between British and American men.Once again, Bushnell returns to the land of the pretty and the powerful, breaking down bedroom doors with her wry humor and frank portrayals of love and lust among the \"It people.\"",

Legions of beginners give up when they could have made it with the aid of a book like this.  But for centuries schoolmasters have frowned on this device, calling it dirty names like crib, crutch, pony. But the truth is that highly educated and motivated people have learned to read a foreign language this way. The great German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who knew many ancient and modern languages, acquired them by using Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's Paul et Virginie as a pony. There are many bilingual series, such as the Loeb Classics or the Bollingen series, which have gained high prestige.",

        "Authors": "By Rogers, Everett M.",
        "Description": "Since the first edition of this landmark book was published in 1962,Everett Rogers's name has become \"virtually synonymous with the studyof diffusion of innovations,\" according to Choice. The second andthird editions of Diffusion of Innovations became the standardtextbook and reference on diffusion studies. Now, in the fourthedition, Rogers presents the culmination of more than thirty years ofresearch that will set a new standard for analysis and inquiry.The fourth edition is (1) a revision of the theoretical framework andthe research evidence supporting this model of diffusion, and (2) anew intellectual venture, in that new concepts and new theoreticalviewpoints are introduced. This edition differs from its predecessorsin that it takes a much more critical stance in its review andsynthesis of 5,000 diffusion publications. During the past thirtyyears or so, diffusion research has grown to be widely recognized,applied and admired, but it has also been subjected to bothconstructive and destructive criticism. This criticism is due in largepart to the stereotyped and limited ways in which many diffusionscholars have defined the scope and method of their field of study.Rogers analyzes the limitations of previous diffusion studies,showing, for example, that the convergence model, by whichparticipants create and share information to reach a mutualunderstanding, more accurately describes diffusion in most cases thanthe linear model. Rogers provides an entirely new set of case examples, from theBalinese Water Temple to Nintendo videogames, that beautifullyillustrate his expansive research, as well as a completely revisedbibliography covering all relevant diffusion scholarship in the pastdecade. Most important, he discusses recent research and currenttopics, including social marketing, forecasting the rate of adoption,technology transfer, and more. This all-inclusive work will beessential reading for scholars and students in the fields ofcommunications, marketing, geography, economic development, politicalscience, sociology, and other related fields for generations to come.",
