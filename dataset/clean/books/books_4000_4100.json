        "Description": "John Updike\u2019s twenty-first novel, a bildungsroman, follows its hero, Owen Mackenzie, from his birth in the semi-rural Pennsylvania town of Willow to his retirement in the rather geriatric community of Haskells Crossing, Massachusetts. In between these two settlements comes Middle Falls, Connecticut, where Owen, an early computer programmer, founds with a partner, Ed Mervine, the successful firm of E-O Data, which is housed in an old gun factory on the Chunkaunkabaug River. Owen\u2019s education(Bildung) is not merely technical but liberal, as the humanity of his three villages, especially that of their female citizens, works to disengage him from his youthful innocence. As a child he early felt an abyss of calamity beneath the sunny surface quotidian, yet also had a dreamlike sense of leading a charmed existence. The women of his life, including his wives, Phyllis and Julia, shed what light they can. At one juncture he reflects, \u201cHow lovely she is, naked in the dark! How little men deserve the beauty and mercy of women!\u201d His life as a sexual being merges with the communal shelter of villages: \u201cA village is woven of secrets, of truths better left unstated, of houses with less window than opaque wall.\u201dThis delightful, witty, passionate novel runs from the Depression era to the early twenty-first century.",

        "Description": "How a business replaces its chief executive often determines that firm's future. If a business does not effectively manage the transfer of power, utter turmoil can result, with profound implications not only for the CEO, but also for the other employees, the shareholders, and the community at large.Filled with inside stories from corporate boardrooms and fresh conceptual perspectives,The Hero's Farewell describes in rich detail the factors that affect executive succession. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld offers the first close examination of the critical role a CEO's departure style plays in helping, or hindering, the transfer of power. Through candid interviews with fifty prominent retired chief executives from corporations such as AT&T, Ford, Dupont, United Technologies, and Raytheon (David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan and Thomas J. Watson, Jr. of IBM among them) and a survey of an additional three hundred top managers, Sonnenfeld identifies the four major types of leadership departure styles. These types includeMonarchs, who choose not to leave voluntarily but either die in office or are overthrown;Generals, who leave reluctantly and spend their retirement planning a comeback;Ambassadors, who retain close ties with their former firms; and Governors, who willingly serve a limited time and leave to pursue new interests.Capturing the human drama of these departures and succession battles, The Hero's Farewell will fascinate anyone intrigued by power struggles in large corporations. Outlining ways to smooth out the inevitable transfers of power that corporations must face, Sonnenfeld presents essential information for all top executives and especially for CEOs.",

        "Description": "Based on the conviction that only translators who write poetry themselves can properly recreate the celebrated and timeless tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the Greek Tragedy in New Translations series offers new translations that go beyond the literal meaning of the Greek in order to evoke the sense of poetry evident in the originals.  Under the editorship of Peter Burian and Alan Shaprio, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on difficult passages, ample stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical names and geographical references encountered in the dialogue.Sophocles' Oedipus the King paves the way as the first in the series to appear in paperback.  In this highly-acclaimed translation of the greatest of all Greek tragedies, Stephen Berg--the well-known poet--and Diskin Clay--the distinguished classicist--combine their talents to offer the contemporary reader a dazzling version of Sophocles' timeless work. Emphasizing the intensity of the spoken language, they capture the unrelenting power of Sophoclean drama. No other English translation conveys the same terrifying emotional level, especially in the choral odes, the forceful descriptions of Jokasta's death, the blinding of Oedipus, and the final scene of desolation. Berg and Clay's translation--now available for the first time in paperback--both adheres strictly to the original meaning of the play and breathes new life into its language.",

Today, millions of women in their twenties and thirties, many of whom are just beginning to plan a family, are receiving the shocking news that their reproductive years are already over. They are in premature menopause -- menopause years before its time. Whether due to an autoimmune disorder, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or the often undiagnosed condition known as Premature Ovarian Failure (POF), premature menopause is common, increasing -- and almost always traumatic.If you are one of the women experiencing early menopause, you have hundreds of questions, but have probably found few answers...until now. The Premature Menopause Book is the first book focusing on this difficult transition -- written by a woman who faced the same questions: What can I do about it? Do I need hormones? How can I have a baby despite this condition? How can I feel like \"me\" again? The Premature Menopause Book provides the latest information on health and emotional issues, explores all of your options, lists resources, websites and support groups, shares the experiences and advice of women going through this experience, answers frequently asked questions and offers the support and understanding you need.",

Even with the most dynamic language, images and characters, no piece of fiction will work without a strong infrastructure. Kercheval shows how to build that structure using tools such as point of view, characterization, pacing and flashbacks.The designs of Frank Lloyd Wright were always influenced by the terrain, says Kercheval. The building site helped him determine the materials and methods of construction. This book will help you envision the landscape of your fiction and build great stories there.",

Here, with the scent of boules cooking in an oak-fired oven, artisan-baker Louis Lapoine introduced the innocent nineteen-year-old to the exquisite parallel pleasures of making bread and making love. Although their affair ended in heartbreak, for Esme, sensual joy and sourdough would forever after be inextricably entwined.Fifteen years later, Esme is living by the sea east of London with her husband, Pog, their four-and-a-half-year-old son, and her grandmother and father-in-law. Esme may no longer be the career-driven, model-thin girl she once was, yet throughout her marriage, one thing has remained a blissful, eagerly awaited constant: Every day she has risen at the crack of dawn to bake sourdough bread from scratch, lovingly kneading the dough from the starter Louis once gave her. But now a major domestic crisis looms. It has been exactly thirty-three days since Esme baked a loaf, and her family fears that their home - the wonderfully eccentric House in the Clouds - will never again smell of crust and comfort.Then, just when Esme is ready to take her life firmly in hand again, an unexpected encounter in a London restaurant sends her world careening wildly off its axis - forcing her to come to terms with the past and a tragedy that has been haunting her for the past two years.",

        "Description": "How do women treat one another in the absence of men to treat them badly? Martha finds out when, reeling from the shock of yet another failed romance and sick of her own starchy literal-mindedness, she seeks solace among a group of somewhat addled devotees of the ancient matriarchal Goddess. Befriended by Isis Moonwagon, an academic turned New Age priestess, Martha follows the Goddess worshippers from the upscale beaches of Fire Island to the inhospitable Arizona desert, where a Native American medicine woman bullies them through the punitive rituals of the sweat lodge and vision quest. As petty tensions and major crises escalate out of control, the women's dream of returning to the simple ways of primitive hunters and gatherers shatters under the pressure of a more predatory reality.With the acerbic wit and compassion that have marked her widely acclaimed previous works, Francine Prose here offers a sharp-eyed consideration of how men and women differ in their pursuit - and avoidance - of power, sex, and competition. A satire of the pieties of New Age religion and knee-jerk feminism, Hunters and Gatherers nevertheless radiates sympathy for our efforts to reconcile spiritual longings with our earthbound, all-too-human nature.",

        "Description": "The development of the supercomputer has given scientists an awesome new capability: the power to virtually re-create the physical world on the computer screen, with a stunning degree of precision and sophistication. Everything from weather systems to biochemical interactions to car crashes to air pollution to high speed subatomic particle collisions can now be simulated, manipulated, and observed at the scientist's will.As a result, supercomputers have led to profound levels of insight and understanding. Indeed, they have revolutionized the very process of scientific discovery itself. Scientists no longer have to rely exclusively on either experiment-based or theoretical research methodologies, but rather can utilize both direct observation and mathematical modeling to visualize and simulate complex phenomena.The fascinating, strikingly illustrated Supercomputing and the Transformation of Science provides a state-of-the-art look at the capabilities and scientific contributions of the most powerful computers. Written by noted science author William Kaufmann and supercomputing expert Larry Smarr, the book examines the hardware, software, and techniques of supercomputing, showing how these powerful machines \"solve\" the mathematical laws that govern natural phenomena and convert the numbers into comprehensive visual images. The book then explores the impact of this extraordinary technology on a wide range of endeavors from medicine to environmental protection, from particle physics to astronomy, from automobile design to meteorology.The computer revolution continues to surge ahead. Reporting from the leading edge of the revolution, Supercomputing and the Transformation of Science shows us how far we have come in devising ways to understand the world in which we live. It is a celebration of the drive for knowledge that led to the development of the first computer not so long ago.",

Morris weaves together three essential themes: the parallel lives and tortured relationship of the Clintons personally; the essence of the bipartisan misrule that is Washington, D.C. (how the collusive culture of our national government defeats change); and, most telling, the behind-the-scenes story of the making of a president in a world where corrupting money and favors flow freely and the tyranny of wealthy interests and their captive politicians mock democracy.Beyond myriad scandals - whether shady bond, banking, and commodity \"deals\"; the Whitewater imbroglio; abuses of power in covering up sexual infidelities; document \"shredding parties\"; the Vince Foster tragedy; or a multibillion-dollar Arkansas gunrunning and drug-smuggling ring implicating the Colombian cartel, the CIA, organized crime, and two Republican presidents as well as a Democratic governor and future president - Morris's evocation of a climb to power is the most candid, revealing, and courageous portrait ever drawn of a sitting president.",

        "Description": "Africa is portrayed by the world's media as a giant disaster area, plagued by civil war, ethnic and tribal conflict, natural and climatic catastrophes, famine and disease. Rural poverty is rife and burgeoning shanty-towns disfigure the outskirts of every African city. Yet travellers, including journalists, people in business and academics, are often struck by the timeless normality of African life and the survival of communities against all odds.This book does not conceal the huge problems, but examines them with empathy and suggests solutions. It stresses the extent to which there has already been positive political, economic and social progress - in particular, the gradual process of democratization and the growth of civil society. People are better educated and trained than ever before, and structural adjustment, despite its often brutal effects, has reduced over-blown state structures in several countries. Aid is now being channelled into stimulating local economic development and is no longer merely a \"\"top-down\"\" exercise. Agricultural production is rising despite the droughts of the early 1990s and there is growing industrialization. This accessible and topical account provides a good introduction to some of the main issues.",

        "Title": "Peace Like a River: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Enger, Leif",
        "Description": "Hailed as one of the year's top five novels by Time, and selected as one of the best books of the year by nearly all major newspapers, national bestseller Peace Like a River captured the hearts of a nation in need of comfort. \"A rich mixture of adventure, tragedy, and healing,\" Peace Like a River is \"a collage of legends from sources sacred and profane -- from the Old Testament to the Old West, from the Gospels to police dramas\" (Ron Charles, The Christian Science Monitor). In \"lyrical, openhearted prose\" (Michael Glitz, The New York Post), Enger tells the story of eleven-year-old Reuben Land, an asthmatic boy who has reason to believe in miracles. Along with his sister and father, Reuben finds himself on a cross-country search for his outlaw older brother who has been controversially charged with murder. Their journey is touched by serendipity and the kindness of strangers, and its remarkable conclusion shows how family, love, and faith can stand up to the most terrifying of enemies, the most tragic of fates. Leif Enger's \"miraculous\" (Valerie Ryan, The Seattle Times) novel is a \"perfect book for an anxious time ... of great literary merit that nonetheless restores readers' faith in the kindness of stories\" (Marta Salij, Detroit Free Press).",

But in those days they didn't call you \"black.\" They didnt say \"minority.\" They called us \"colored\" or \"nigger.\"Leon Tillage grew up the son of a sharecropper in a small town in North Carolina. Told in vignettes, this is his story about walking four miles to the school for black children, and watching a school bus full of white children go past. It's about his being forced to sit in the balcony at the movie theater, hiding all night when the Klansmen came riding, and worse. Much worse.But it is also the story of a strong family and the love that bound them together. And, finally, it's about working to change an oppressive existence by joining the civil rights movement. Edited from recorded interviews conducted by Susan L. Roth, Leon's story will stay with readers long after they have finished his powerful account.Leon's Story is the winner of the 1998 Boston Globe - Horn Book Award for Nonfiction.",

        "Authors": "By Dent, David J.",
        "Description": "Exposing myths and exploding stereotypes, In Search of Black America is a landmark work that looks at the lives of African Americans throughout the United States. David Dent, a noted journalist and professor, set out on a cross-country road trip into the heart of black America with stops in Detroit; Washington, D.C.; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Gallipolis, Ohio; Seattle, Washington; Hampton, Virginia; and many other places, including Lawnside, New Jersey, a historically black town with strong roots and ties to the Underground Railroad.  This book is the result of his five-year odyssey, which took him and his tape recorder to upscale art galleries, schools, bowling alleys, formal balls, college campuses, fishing trips, mansions, summer homes, ranches, rodeos, and many more places -- well off the beaten path. What he discovered not only contradicts most of the common stereotypes about black America prevalent in today's popular media but uncovers new truths about African-Americana.  Drawing from hundreds of hours of taped interviews and keen journalistic observation, Dent uncovers the widespread diversity of the lives of the black majority -- middle- and upper-middle-class African Americans. Along the way, Dent encounters a most eclectic and insightful array of characters. Through their lives, he not only examines and questions the most common American beliefs about race and politics but also explores issues that go beyond race and touch on social and moral questions that Americans of any hue confront.  All of Dent's subjects share at least one thing: They park pieces of their lives in what Dent calls secluded spaces of black culture. Few are separatists but most are profoundly ambivalent -- yet often hopeful for a future America free of racial inequality and social injustice.  Candid and honest, controversial and pragmatic, In Search of Black America is written with journalistic fervor, and will change the way people view this piece of America that is often over-looked and little",

Fathers reveal how their daughters brought out their protective, responsible, and loving sides and remember both the fears and the pride they felt as their little girls became independent women.

        "Description": "With one nerve-shattering New York Times bestseller after another, Michael Palmer has demonstrated his extraordinary ability to create medical thrillers that are at once relentlessly suspenseful and chillingly realistic. And now the former ER physician returns with the stunning and explosive tale of a gifted neurosurgeon drawn into a world of escalating danger and violence, all because of...The Patient.Dr. Jessie Copeland is exactly where she wants to be: A respected neurosurgeon at Eastern Mass Medical Center, she spends her days waging life-and-death battles in the OR and her spare time holed up in a lab, spearheading the development of a tiny robot that could revolutionize brain surgery.ARTIE--Assisted Robotic Tissue Incision and Extraction--is an exciting fusion of biomechanics and radiology that, when perfected, will be able to excise tumors now considered inoperable. But it could be months before ARTIE is ready for use on human beings...or so Jessie thinks, until her ambitious department head jumps the gun and uses the robot in a high-profile case that nets immediate worldwide attention.Suddenly the hospital is swarming with media, vying for a multimillion-dollar grant, and fielding calls from patients desperate for this lifesaving technology. But what no one at the medical center realizes is that the publicity has also reached one of the most malevolent men on earth.Claude Malloche is brilliant, secretive, remorseless, and without regard for human life--a mercenary willing to bring down a world leader or a jetliner filled with people if the price is right. He is also ill with a life-threatening brain tumor that is exactly the sort ARTIE was invented to treat. Now Malloche must come into the open, and he has set his sights on the hospital that has burst to the forefront of neurosurgery: Eastern Mass Medical Center.For those caught on the neurosurgical floor, the nightmare has just begun...and no one is more aware of the stakes than Jessie Copeland. In brain surgery there are no guarantees. But that's exactly what Claude Malloche demands, leaving Jessie to face the most harrowing case of her life. Disaster is just a cut away. And the price of failure may be thousands of lives....Heart-poundingly scary and immensely entertaining, The Patient is riveting, unpredictable, page-turning suspense. It is terror to which no one is immune.Claude Malloche is a master assassin, more rumor than man, for whom murder is an art.\u00a0\u00a0No one can identify his face.\u00a0\u00a0Now Malloche has a deadly brain tumor, and he intends to have the best neurosurgeon in the world operate on it.To ensure Jessie's cooperation, Malloche has devised a plan of intimidation that puts at risk her life and the lives of hundreds of innocent people.\u00a0\u00a0Neurosurgery requires nerves of steel, but in coming up with a scheme to fulfill her oath as a doctor yet thwart a diabolical killer, Jessie will be performing the most complex surgery of her career--on a knife-edge of terror.With every book he writes, Michael Palmer raises the standard of the medical thriller, writing \"wrenchingly scary,\"* \"chillingly sinister\"** novels packed with the authenticity that his years as an ER physician provide.\u00a0\u00a0THE PATIENT\u00a0\u00a0proves he is the master of scalpel-sharp suspense. -->",

The daughter of a banker and diplomat, the wife of Charles Lindbergh, and a pioneer aviatrix, she also wrote one of the most beloved works of our century, A Gift from the Sea. This compelling biography explores the career of this remarkable woman, beginning with her sheltered and privileged upbringing and her marriage to the foremost hero of her generation and continuing on to the trauma of their baby's kidnapping, the ensuing years of self-imposed exile, the bitter controversy concerning Lindbergh's political isolationism, and the postwar years, which saw the publication of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's most enduring works.Dorothy Herrmann offers a sensitive, probing life that is brimful with prominent figures of the century: Amelia Earhart, Franklin Roosevelt, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Frida Kahlo, Joseph Kennedy, Hermann Goring, Harold Nicolson, Vita Sackville-West, and Charles Lindbergh, the brilliant, troubled young man who was catapulted to fame in 1927 by his solo flight across the Atlantic. Throughout we watch Anne Morrow Lindbergh's struggle to find her own identity and then to balance the demands of being a wife, a mother, and an artist amid the contending pressures of family and fame. In depicting the excitement, tragedy, and ultimate triumph of Anne Morrow Lindbergh, this biography adds a significant new chapter to the history of women in the twentieth century.",

He provides the full story behind his \"confrontation\" with Vice President George Bush over the Iran-contra scandal. And from Tiananmen Square to Red Square, from devastating floods in the Midwest to hurricanes in the Atlantic, he takes you with him as he scours the world for breaking stories and shows how and why what we see on our television screens winds up there.Here is his inside account of his interview with Saddam Hussein, the first by any American after the invasion of Kuwait. Here are his candid reflections on returning to Vietnam with General H. Norman Schwarzkopf - the first time back for both men. Here is a chance encounter with Mikhail Gorbachev inside the Kremlin. And here are his observations on the aftermath of the Cold War, the fall of the Wall in Berlin, and the present strife in the former Yugoslavia.Rather laces the narrative with short pieces on subjects ranging from encounters with two very different late-night dictators - Fidel Castro and David Letterman - to the real story behind the so-called \"six-minute blackout\" in Miami, the night CBS put the pope on hold to finish a tennis match.In The Camera Never Blinks Twice, Rather pays homage to some of the all-time greats of broadcasting - including Murrow and Sevareid - and to all the courageous journalists who risk their lives to bring home the news. And he doesn't pull any punches in his assessment of world leaders, government officials, the press - or himself.",
