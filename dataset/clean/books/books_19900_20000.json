Speculation remains rife as to its probable conclusion; evidence suggests that, fascinated as Dickens was by details of the plotting, his basic concern was for character and appropriate setting, in particular the character of the hero-villain, Jasper. The ancient city of Cloisterham, its cathedral a reminder of mortality, human frailty, and the lawful life, is an effective background for what Dickens's daughter called a tale of 'the tragic secrets of the human heart'. Humour is provided by a host of characters ranging from Mr Grewgious, the admirable though eccentric lawyer, and Miss Twinkleton, guardian of the Young Ladies' Seminary, to Durdles, the hard-drinking stonemason, and Deputy, the irreverent lodging-house boy.",

In The Inner Voice, this great singer shares what she has learned from her experience as an inspiration for those contemplating a career in the arts. From struggling to get a career under way to dealing with her own personal doubts, Fleming is wonderfully candid and articulate about her art?especially the little discussed heart-throat-mind connection?and childhood influences, formal education, mentors, preparation, and mental and physical discipline. Here is a look at the real life of an artist today, a life confronted by the loneliness of touring, the need for resilience, the desire for creativity in the face of overwhelming commercial pressures, coping with business issues, and, most important, balancing personal and professional fulfillment. The Inner Voice adds its distinctive voice to works such as Eudora Welty?s One Writer?s Beginnings and Uta Hagen?s Respect for Acting, teaching by example and the hard-won human lessons all artists must learn. It will be eagerly awaited not only by her legion of fans, but will also be required reading for anyone contemplating a career in the arts.",

There is no higher praise we can give people than to say they have good character.  But what, really, does that mean?  What makes this quality so essential to achieving personal success and fulfillment?  More important, how can we build our own character and live more satisfying lives? Reflecting society's diversity, the contributing authors speak from various cultural and professional backgrounds to share their observations on living with integrity, honesty, and compassion. This select group includes best-selling authors, educators, journalists, artists, business executives, political leaders, attorneys, and media figures. From Dan Rather of CBS, radio host Dr. Laura Schlessinger, and author Arianna Huffington to management expert Stephen R. Covey, attorney Alan M. Dershowitz, and sports commentator John Naber, the contributors explore how character and ethics shape our destinies. For a better home and work life, they call for the cultivation of character-- in ourselves, in our co-workers, in our neighbors, and in our children. Their stories will inspire readers to explore character as a means of building better personal lives, and a better world.",

        "Title": "Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam (Pivotal Moments in American History)",
        "Authors": "By McPherson, James M.",
        "Description": "The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, was the bloodiest single day in American history, with more than 6,000 soldiers killed--four times the number lost on D-Day, and twice the number killed in the September 11th terrorist attacks. In Crossroads of Freedom, America's most eminent Civil War historian, James M. McPherson, paints a masterful account of this pivotal battle, the events that led up to it, and its aftermath.As McPherson shows, by September 1862 the survival of the United States was in doubt. The Union had suffered a string of defeats, and Robert E. Lee's army was in Maryland, poised to threaten Washington. The British government was openly talking of recognizing the Confederacy and brokering a peace between North and South.  Northern armies and voters were demoralized. And Lincoln had shelved his proposed edict of emancipation months before, waiting for a victory that had not come--that some thought would never come. Both Confederate and Union troops knew the war was at a crossroads, that they were marching toward a decisive battle. It came along the ridges and in the woods and cornfields between Antietam Creek and the Potomac River. Valor, misjudgment, and astonishing coincidence all played a role in the outcome.  McPherson vividly describes a day of savage fighting in locales that became forever famous--The Cornfield, the Dunkard Church, the West Woods, and Bloody Lane. Lee's battered army escaped to fight another day, but Antietam was a critical victory for the Union.  It restored morale in the North and kept Lincoln's party in control of Congress. It crushed Confederate hopes of British intervention. And it freed Lincoln to deliver the Emancipation Proclamation, which instantly changed the character of the war. McPherson brilliantly weaves these strands of diplomatic, political, and military history into a compact, swift-moving narrative that shows why America's bloodiest day is, indeed, a turning point in our history.",

The answer is no.Brainless: The Lies and Lunacy of Ann Coulter is an unbridled look at a woman who twists the truth, misleads, plays loose with facts and allusions, and has been accused of plagiarism in hammering home her logic-defying arguments.Brainless illustrates the dangers, ironies, and hypocrisies of the Mistress of Malice. She spews her venom generously across the spectrum. Democrats and Liberals are just the beginning. If you're a woman (you shouldn't vote), gay (you're going to hell), a 9/11 widow (dancing on your murdered husband's grave) or Bill Clinton (slurs and charges too numerous to mention here), you will find yourself the object of her ire.Now it's time to turn the tables and take a good hard look at the High Priestess of Hypocrisy. Journalist Joe Maguire takes apart her arguments, picks apart her agenda, and gives us a look at the psychology and background of the woman who has reduced public political and cultural debate to browbeating and name-calling.Diligently researched (with source notes you can verify!), Maguire separates fact from myth and gives us an unvarnished look at the REAL Ann Coulter.Let's face it. You don't ever want to read a book by Ann Coulter. Read this so you don't have to!",

        "Title": "The Sense of Beauty: Being the Outline of Aesthetic Theory",
        "Authors": "By Santayana, George",
        "Description": "It is remarkably appropriate that this work on aesthetics should have been written by George Santayana, who is probably the most brilliant philosophic writer and the philosopher with the strongest sense of beauty since Plato. It is not a dry metaphysical treatise, as works on aesthetics so often are, but is itself a fascinating document: as much a revelation of the beauty of language as of the concept of beauty.This unabridged reproduction of the 1896 edition of lectures delivered at Harvard College is a study of \"why, when, and how beauty appears, what conditions an object must fulfill to be beautiful, what elements of our nature make us sensible of beauty, and what the relation is between the constitution of the object and the excitement of our susceptibility.\"Santayana first analyzes the nature of beauty, finding it irrational, \"pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing.\" He then proceeds to the materials of beauty, showing what all human functions can contribute: love, social instincts, senses, etc. Beauty of form is then analyzed, and finally the author discusses the expression of beauty. Literature, religion, values, evil, wit, humor, and the possibility of finite perfection are all examined. Presentation throughout the work is concrete and easy to follow, with examples drawn from art, history, anthropology, psychology, and similar areas.",

        "Title": "The Myth of Global Chaos",
        "Authors": "By Sadowski, Yahya M.",
        "Description": "When the Cold War ended in 1989, American hopes for a new world order were quickly disappointed. A new wave of violence soon erupted, engulfing places from Rwanda and Somalia to Chechnya and Bosnia. These new \"clashes of civilizations,\" fundamentalist jihads, and ethnic massacres appeared to be more savage and less rational than the long twilight struggle with the USSR, during which Washington's adversary was clearly identified and relatively predictable.In an effort to understand these post-Cold War conflicts and to advise the government on how to deal with them, a new school of foreign policy thought has developed. Dubbed \"chaos theory,\" it argues that the much heralded processes of globalization are actually breeding a reaction of irrational violence. Thus, the spread of Western cultural icons through new electronic media often shocks and offends moral sensibilities in traditional societies. The explosive growth of international commerce has triggered a wave of migration and urbanization that throws together people from different cultures and fertilizes xenophobia. Chaos theory has already won converts in the U.S. military, the intelligence community, and the foreign service. Its influence has been manifest in an array of policies, particularly during the U.S. engagement in Bosnia.But chaos theory is mostly wrong. In this book, the author outlines the growth of chaos theory and its growing influence, and then provides a thorough empirical critique. Using detailed studies of Bosnia and global comparisons, he shows that globalization has not played a decisive role in fueling recent conflicts. Indeed, journalists' impressions notwithstanding, there is no evidence that since 1989 warfare has become more savage or even more frequent. The advocates of chaos theory are thus urging the U.S. to invest in preparing for a threat that is largely mythical--a strategy that is at least wasteful and potentially dangerous. The author argues that the most useful tools for preventing or prosecuting post-Cold War conflicts remain the same ones that worked in the recent past: crafty diplomacy, conventional military preparedness, and expanded support for economic development.Previously titled Is Chaos a Strategic Threat?

        "Title": "The Nuclear Age",
        "Authors": "By O'Brien, Tim",
        "Description": "Going After Cacciato (winner of the National Book Award in 1979) was widely acclaimed as one of the most powerful and emotionally vivid novels about Vietnam. Now, writing with the same sharp, richly expressive language, the same edgy dark humor and complete honesty, and the same rawness of nerve and energy, Tim O\u2019Brien gives us an equally powerful novel about growing up as a child of anxiety\u2014thebig anxiety, the one that\u2019s been with us since the fifties, when we finally realized that Einstein\u2019s theories translated into Russian.It\u2019s 1995 and William Cowling is digging a hole in his backyard. He is forty-nine, and after years and years of pent-up terror he has finally found the courage of a fighting man. And so a hole. A hold that he hopes will one day be large enough to swallow up his almost fifty years\u2019 worth of fear. A hole that causes his twelve-year-old daughter to call him a \u201cnutto,\u201d and his wife to stop speaking to him. A hole that William will not stop digging and out of which rise scenes of his past to play themselves out in his memory.The scenes take him back to his quietly peculiar adolescence (No. 2 pencils had a surprising significance), to his college days, down into the underground, and up through several stabs at \u201cnormal\u201d adulthood . . . they take him from Montana to Florida, from Cuba to California, from Kansas to New York to Germany and back to Montana as he makes him way through an often mystifying\u2014but just as often hilarious \u2014labyrinth of fears and desires, obsessions and obligations, blessed madness and less-than-blessed sobriety . . . they take him into the lives of a shrink who\u2019s a whiz a role reversal and of a dizzying eccentric cheerleader; of radical misfits and misfit radicals; of an ethereal stewardess (the traveling man\u2019s dream); and two guerilla commandos who mix shtick and nightmare in their tactical brew. And each scene is a reminder of the unbargained-for-terror that has guided him to the bottom of his hole. For this digging is his final act of \u201cprudence and sanity\u201d\u2014he\u2019s taking control, getting there first, robbing his fears of their power to destroy . . . or so he believes. But is this act really sane? Is his daughter\u2019s estimation of his emotional well-being (\u201cpretty buggo, too\u201d) the only truly sane statement being made? Is sanity even the issue? In the dazzling final scenes, William turns from the hole\u2014from his past and from his future 0 to himself, digging deeper and deeper to find his answers.The Nuclear Age is pyrotechnically funny and moving, courageous and irreverent. It takes on our supreme unacknowledged terror (whose reality we both refuse to accept and all too easily accommodate ourselves to), finds it lunatic core, and shapes it into a story that speaks of, and to, an entire age: our own, our nuclear age. It is an extraordinary novel.",

        "Description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of Band of Brothers and D-Day, the definitive book on Lewis and Clark\u2019s exploration of the Louisiana Purchase, the most momentous expedition in American history and one of the great adventure stories of all time.In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson selected his personal secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, to lead a voyage up the Missouri River to the Rockies, over the mountains, down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, and back. Lewis and his partner, Captain William Clark, made the first map of the trans-Mississippi West, provided invaluable scientific data on the flora and fauna of the Louisiana Purchase territory, and established the American claim to Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Ambrose has pieced together previously unknown information about weather, terrain, and medical knowledge at the time to provide a vivid backdrop for the expedition. Lewis is supported by a rich variety of colorful characters, first of all Jefferson himself, whose interest in exploring and acquiring the American West went back thirty years. Next comes Clark, a rugged frontiersman whose love for Lewis matched Jefferson\u2019s. There are numerous Indian chiefs, and Sacagawea, the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition, along with the French-Indian hunter Drouillard, the great naturalists of Philadelphia, the French and Spanish fur traders of St. Louis, John Quincy Adams, and many more leading political, scientific, and military figures of the turn of the century. High adventure, high politics, suspense, drama, and diplomacy combine with high romance and personal tragedy to make this outstanding work of scholarship as readable as a novel.",

You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twenty-something guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had to drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls, and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten landed in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey, Jr., are immediately dashed by the grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click, and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life\u2014and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is real. Dry is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a higher power.

        "Title": "Baseball: An Illustrated History",
        "Authors": "By Ward, Geoffrey C. and Burns, Ken",
        "Description": "The authors of the acclaimed and history-making nationwide best-seller The Civil War now turn to the other defining American phenomenon. Their subject is baseball. And in words and pictures they provide the richest evocation we have ever had of the formidable institution that is our beloved national pastime, the \"mere game\" woven so deeply into our lives that it provides common ground for young and old, black and white, North, South, East, and West - for taxi driver and schoolteacher and president of the United States.During eight months of the year, it is played professionally every day; all year round, amateurs play it, watch it, and dream about it, losing themselves in a base runner's progress around the diamond, in the elemental clash between pitcher and batter, in the outfielder's lonely vigil. Baseball produces remarkable Americans: it seizes hold of ordinary people and shapes them into something we must regard with awe. Ty Cobb, Satchel Paige, Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Joe DiMaggio, Hank Aaron, not gods exactly, not even necessarily heroes, but truly gifted human beings acting out universal fantasies that, for whatever reason, are most perfectly expressed on a baseball field.All this and more rings through Geoffrey C. Ward and Ken Burns's moving, crowded, fascinating history of the game - a history that goes beyond stolen bases, triple plays, and home runs (although they, too, are here) to demonstrate how baseball has been influenced by, and has in turn influenced, our national life: politics, race, labor, big business, advertising, social custom, literature, art, and morality. The book covers every milestone of the game: from the rules drawn up in 1845 by Alexander Cartwright to the American League's introduction of the designated hitter in 1973, from the founding of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players in 1885 to the seven-week players' strike of 1981, from the 1924 Negro World Series (Kansas City Monarchs vs. Philadelphia Hilldales) to Jack Roosevelt Robinson's major-league debut in 1947, from the first curve ball in 1867 (pitched by Candy Cummings of the Brooklyn Excelsiors) to Nolan Ryan's seventh and last no-hitter in 1991. Nine essays by notable baseball enthusiasts, exploring their individual preoccupations with the game, complement the narrative. And a wealth of pictures, many in full color, document baseball's evolution since the mid-nineteenth century and bring to life its most memorable practitioners.Monumental, affecting, informative, entertaining, and sumptuously illustrated - Baseball is a book that speaks to all Americans.",

        "Title": "The End of the Hunt",
        "Authors": "By Flanagan, Thomas",
        "Description": "Thomas Flanagan, author of The Year of the French and The Tenants of Time, has written an epic of the 20th century. It is set in Ireland at the time of the Troubles, during the watershed year of 1919. World War I has ended and the British are attempting to put down once and for all the centuries-old dream of an independent Ireland.As before, Flanagan brings to life a wide range of historical figures and fictional characters whose private lives are shaped by the public history that leaves no one untouched. His heroine, Janice Nugent, a member of the Irish Catholic landed gentry, has been living through the war years in London, her young life scarred by the death in 1915 of her soldier husband, an officer in an Irish battalion fighting in France alongside the British. In the winter of 1919, she decides to return to Ireland. In fact, she is going back to her family and their ancient estate in Galway, because she is tired of being one of a generation of war widows, and hopes to find in the serenity of Coolater a way of rebuilding her life. But on the way from Dublin, her train is stopped by I.R.A. gunmen, who take off a civilian passenger and execute him, virtually under Janice's gaze. To a fellow passenger in the first-class carriage she says, \"I loathe guns.\" Yet within the year she will be in love with a man described by newpapers as a gunman. That man is Christopher Blake, a young historian who has put his pen and sophisticated intelligence at the service of Michael Collins and the cause of Irish independence. As they become lovers more deeply and more fatefully than either of them had intended, Blake draws Janice into the searing revolutionary struggle.On the pages of this gripping novel, we are transported from the smoky pubs of Dublin, where men argue eloquently but action has the final word, to the Irish countryside, where lonely roads become paths to the grave as fast as a rifle shot; from stately manors, where an ancient way of life is threatened, to the gleaming London conference table, where men like Lloyd George and Winston Churchill play games of power, tainting the triumph of their Irish opponents; through the painful dilemmas and grievous losses of men and women for whom old certainties have been splintered and new sides must be chosen. The End of the Hunt is fiction of a very high order. It brings us face-to-face with history as it was made, and life as it was given and lost.",

        "Title": "What's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America",
        "Authors": "By Frank, Thomas",
        "Description": "Thomas Frank turns his eye on what he calls \"the Great Backlash\" - the popular revolt against a supposedly liberal establishment. Marshaling public outrage over everything from improper flag display to un-Christian art, the backlash has achieved the most unnatural of alliances, bringing together blue-collar midwesterners and Wall Street business interests, workers and bosses, populists and right-wingers.In asking \"What's the matter with Kansas?\" - how a place famous for its radicalism came to rank among the nation's most eager audiences for backlash bunkum - Frank, a native Kansan and onetime conservative, seeks to answer some fundamental American riddles: Why do so many Americans vote against their economic and social interests? Where's the outrage at corporate thievery? Why do illusory slights to the Ten Commandments trouble some people more than do the prospects of falling wages or monopoly power or the destruction of their very way of life?Frank answers these questions by examining the conservative revolution in his home state, a place that has lately drawn the astonished attention of the world for its unlikely skirmishes over abortion and homosexuality. In Kansas, as in so much of mid-America, Frank finds, society's losers are even more committed to the Republican agenda than are society's winners. The state's low-wage slaughterhouse workers and its struggling farm towns today far outdo the state's real-estate millionaires and its prosperous telecom execs in dedication to a political program that can only wind up hurting them.What's the Matter with Kansas? is a portrait of an upside-down country where blue-collar patriots recite the Pledge while they strangle their life chances; where small farmers cast votes for an economic order that will eventually push them off the land; and where a group of frat boys, lawyers, and CEOs has managed to convince the world that it speaks on behalf of the common People.",

        "Description": "At last, the passionate pundit and alliterative analyst William Safire has written of his lifelong love affair with Norma Loquendi - common speech.Translated from Latin, Norma Loquendi means \"the everyday voice of the native speaker.\" William Safire has been entranced by plain-spoken language all of his life.Consumed by his desire for the proper word, Safire bares his soul, explaining why he favors naked aggression over nude aggression. He sensitively probes virile woman, a phrase uttered by cigarette advertisers in search of a new target group. And, taking liberties with Norma, Safire admits he prefers enthuse to emote, excite, or gush, even though he knows enthuse is not yet Standard English.Readers will experience the rapture of knowing the difference between a bubba (a Southern redneck male) and a buba (an affectionate Yiddish term for a small grandmother). They will be able to distinguish between rich and wealthy (\"A rich family has to wait until its money ages before it becomes a wealthy family\"). And perhaps most important, they will discover the correct pronunciation of salmon.A grand amount will attract attention, so it comes as no surprise that Safire's liaisons with Norma are scrutinized by a crowd of grammatical voyeurs known as the Lexicographic Irregulars, including Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, General Colin Powell, and comedian George Carlin, who invented the phrase vuja de (\"the eerie sense that you never want to be in this place again\").Words slip in and out of vogue. Meanings change. Grammar can be hard. Only love of the lingo survives. William Safire knows, and he's willing to explain the difference between who and whom to prove it. Norma Loquendi - fickle, mysterious, relentless - will forever earn your tryst.",

        "Description": "A terrorist attack on the United States is imminent. Renegade Syrian intelligence operatives have found the most effective way of smuggling forty pounds of uranium-235 -- the key material needed to build an atomic weapon -- into the United States undetected. With calculated cunning, the terrorists hit upon exploiting a network of the most experienced, sophisticated smugglers the world has ever known....As the CIA repeatedly misinterprets numerous intelligence warnings, only the irresistible Marta Pradilla -- Colombia's beautiful, tough new female president, who has become a close friend of the conservative, isolationist U.S. president, John Stockman -- can help the United States find the terrorists and their deadly cargo before they can breach the point of entry, before it's too late.Set in Washington, D.C., Bogot\u00e1, Rome, and Tbilisi, and featuring appearances by major international figures such as Fidel Castro and the presidents of France, Syria, and many others, Point of Entry propels readers into an intensely treacherous world that reads less like fiction every day. From remote international borders to covert government operations on the highest level, it is ultimately a story about the consequences of crossing boundaries. It is about the personal relationship between two world leaders that traverses beyond the politically acceptable and the porous borders that may not be able to protect millions of innocent lives from the murderous intent of those with nothing to lose.",

        "Description": "Set on the border between South Africa and an unnamed neighboring country in the 1970s, A Blade of Grass is a suspenseful novel about a bitter struggle over a small farm and its dramatic consequences for two women, one white and one black. The story centers on M\u00e4rit Laurens, a young woman of British descent, recently orphaned and newly wed, who comes to live with her husband, Ben, on their newly purchased farm. Shortly after her arrival, violence strikes at the heart of M\u00e4rit's world, leaving her alone and isolated. Devastated, confused, but determined to run the farm on her own, M\u00e4rit finds herself in a simmering tug of war between the local Afrikaner community that surrounds the farm and the black workers who live on it, both vying for control over the land in the wake of tragedy.  M\u00e4rit's only supporter is her black housekeeper, Tembi, who, like M\u00e4rit, is alone in the world. The women are determined to hold on to the farm, but the quietly encroaching civil war brings out conflicting loyalties that turn the fight for the farm into a fight for their lives.  A Blade of Grass is a wrenching story of friendship and betrayal and of the trauma of the land that has shaped post-colonial Africa. Thrilling to read and morally complex in its message, it offers a fresh, profound, and emotionally immediate perspective on what it means to be black or white in a country where both races live and feel entitlement.",

        "Title": "Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter (Hinges of History)",
        "Authors": "By Cahill, Thomas",
        "Description": "In the fourth volume of the acclaimed Hinges of History series, Thomas Cahill brings his characteristic wit and style to a fascinating tour of ancient Greece. The Greeks invented everything from Western warfare to mystical prayer, from logic to statecraft. Many of their achievements, particularly in art and philosophy, are widely celebrated; other important innovations and accomplishments, however, are unknown or underappreciated. In Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea, Thomas Cahill explores the legacy, good and bad, of the ancient Greeks. From the origins of Greek culture in the migrations of armed Indo-European tribes into Attica and the Peloponnesian peninsula, to the formation of the city-states, to the birth of Western literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, art, and architecture, Cahill makes the distant past relevant to the present. Greek society is one of the two primeval influences on the Western world: While Jews gave us our value system, the Greeks set the foundation and framework for our intellectual lives. They are responsible for our vocabulary, our logic, and our entire system of categorization. They provided the intellectual tools we bring to bear on problems in philosophy, mathematics, medicine, physics, and the other sciences. Their modes of thinking, considered in classical times to be the pinnacle of human achievement, are largely responsible for the shape that the Christian religion took. But, as Cahill points out, the Greeks left a less appealing bequest as well. They created Western militarism and, in making the warrior the ultimate ideal, perpetrated the assumption that only males could be entrusted with the duties of citizenship. The consequences of their exclusion of women from the political sphere and the social segregation of the sexes continue to reverberate today. Full of surprising, often controversial, insights, Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea is a remarkable intellectual adventure\u2014conducted by the most companionable guide imaginable. Cahill\u2019s knowledge of his sources is so intimate that he has made his own fresh translations of the Greek lyric poets for this volume.",

        "Description": "For more than thirty years, the case has remained stone cold -- the brutal murder of a local Papago girl, her butchered body found stuffed into a large cooler that was left on the side of Highway 86. No one ever paid for the horrific crime ... except, that is, the victim's loved ones, who suffer to this day.Brandon Walker, once the sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, no longer feels he has purpose. A reluctant retiree living in the long shadow of his wife, Diana Ladd, a successful author of true-crime books, he is bored with golf, and more so with life. Salvation, though, comes with an invitation to join the ranks of The Last Chance, an exclusive nationwide fraternity of former cops and forensic experts who look into unsolved murders that have baffled local law enforcement agencies. And one such case is staring Brandon in the face with cold, dead, entreating eyes -- a murder investigation that may have been mishandled by his department when he was a young lawman.The trail of a sadistic, calculating, and blood-chillinglyefficient killer soon leads Brandon into a strange world at the unlikely border between forensic science and tribal mysticism: a place where evil hides behind a perfect facade. Now the seeds of terror sown three decades earlier have bloomed and are bearing awful fruit. A forgotten homicide in the Arizona desert is only the beginning of the nightmare that is about to ensnare a diligent ex-cop and his family, for Brandon Walker is the only one still alive who can unravel a blood knot of terror and obsession that will free a dark truth more frightening than he ever imagined.A novel that bristles with electrifying intensity and is alive with the breathtaking atmosphere and rich characterizations that have become J. A. Jance trademarks, Day of the Dead is a gripping and extraordinary journey into the darkness -- a welcome return to the shadow world of the sensational New York Times bestseller Kiss of the Bees -- and the author's most spellbinding and powerfully resonant thriller to date.",

        "Title": "Money-Driven Medicine: The Real Reason Health Care Costs So Much",
        "Authors": "By Mahar, Maggie",
        "Description": "Why is medical care in the United States so expensive? For decades, Americans have taken it as a matter of faith that we spend more because we have the best health care system in the world. But as costs levitate, that argument becomes more difficult to make. Today, we spend twice as much as Japan on health care\u2014yet few would argue that our health care system is twice as good.Instead, startling new evidence suggests that one out of every three of our health care dollars is squandered on unnecessary or redundant tests; unproven, sometimes unwanted procedures; and overpriced drugs and devices that, too often, are no better than the less expensive products they have replaced.How did this happen? In Money-Driven Medicine, Maggie Mahar takes the reader behind the scenes of a $2 trillion industry to witness how billions of dollars are wasted in a Hobbesian marketplace that pits the industry's players against each other. In remarkably candid interviews, doctors, hospital administrators, patients, health care economists, corporate executives, and Wall Street analysts describe a war of \"all against all\" that can turn physicians, hospitals, insurers, drugmakers, and device makers into blood rivals. Rather than collaborating, doctors and hospitals compete. Rather than sharing knowledge, drugmakers and device makers divide value. Rather than thinking about long-term collective goals, the imperatives of an impatient marketplace force health care providers to focus on short-term fiscal imperatives. And so investments in untested bleeding-edge medical technologies crowd out investments in information technology that might, in the long run, not only reduce errors but contain costs.In theory, free market competition should tame health care inflation. In fact, Mahar demonstrates, when it comes to medicine, the traditional laws of supply and demand do not apply. Normally, when supply expands, prices fall. But in the health care industry, as the number and variety of drugs, devices, and treatments multiplies, demand rises to absorb the excess, and prices climb. Meanwhile, the perverse incentives of a fee-for-service system reward health care providers for doing more, not less.In this superbly written book, Mahar shows why doctors must take responsibility for the future of our health care industry. Today, she observes, \"physicians have been stripped of their standing as professionals: Insurers address them as vendors ('Dear Health Care Provider'), drugmakers and device makers see them as customers (someone you might take to lunch or a strip club), while . . . consumers (aka patients) are encouraged to see their doctors as overpaid retailers. . . . Before patients can reclaim their rightful place as the center\u2014and indeed as the raison d'\u00eatre\u2014of our health care system,\" Mahar suggests, \"we must once again empower doctors . . . to practice patient-centered medicine\u2014based not on corporate imperatives, doctors' druthers, or even patients' demands,\" but on the best scientific research available.",

He is haunted both by his own, shameful history of \"passing\" as a white man in college, and by the prospects for his people in the harsh, new, racist age he fears the world is entering.

From then on, their paths cross repeatedly as they each go about trying to find what they really want out of the roiling, wartime city, until the moment when Harlem finally erupts around them, as a people driven beyond endurance strikes out blindly at all the forces keeping it entrapped in misery and hopelessness.

        "Description": "A well-conceived, nicely executed historical atlas. The selection of maps is designed to illustrate subjects which are of interest and importance in themselves, but also to assist the reader to form a general view of human history as a whole.  Accordingly, the text offers a series of essays on some of the larger themes and questions which provide a historical context for a particular group of maps. It's up-to-date to the end of 1994; but, of course, recent events call urgently for a newly updated edition. 9x12\" Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.",
