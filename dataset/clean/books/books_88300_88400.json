Living on a borrowed estate, he undertook to clear the property, and his young son bonded with his father as they worked alongside each other in the woods. When thirteen-year-old Ben contracted polio, his father nursed him back to health until they could go to work again. Ben Bradlee tells the story of how this lifelong love of working outdoors enabled him to forge an intimate connection with his own son, Quinn, who was born with a heart defect and is learning disabled. Quinn Bradlee writes about how his father gave him courage and confidence, about what it is like not just to be the son of the Ben Bradlee but his father\u2019s best pal. He tells wistfully how their roles have reversed and how he has become his father\u2019s protector. Sally Quinn, wife and mother, offers her observation on fathers and sons in this joyous celebration of a special relationship.",

It not only speaks true but makes you strive for more.\u201d--Stephen R. Covey, author,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness\u201cBeautifully written and full of wisdom, The Ring in the Rubble is a gem.\u201d--Ken Blanchard, co-author ofThe One Minute Manager and Leading at a Higher LevelChange always creates hidden opportunities. A leader's job is unearthing them. InThe Ring in the Rubble, change authority Gary Bradt reveals the secrets to moving beyond the rubble of disruption, fear, and uncertainty that change often creates, to finding the golden ring of opportunity that always lies beneath.Each chapter of this breakthrough book delivers a powerful principle for leading change, supported by engaging real-life experiences of the author and other well-known business executives that illustrate how to put principles into action. Bradt asks penetrating questions that help you \u201cdig deeper\u201d and pinpoint the best ways for applying these principles to your specific change effort.You will discover how Richard Schulze weathered a devastating event that threatened to destroy everything he'd worked so hard to build-and became the founder of Best Buy in the process. You'll see how a 65-year-old man, nearly broke after having suffered a string of disastrous setbacks, dug through the rubble to emerge as Colonel Harland Sanders, who remains the face of Kentucky Fried Chicken to this day. Change itself doesn't dictate the eventual outcome of your situation; how you think about and handle change is what makes all the difference. You'll never find the ring if you don't start digging!",

Madison's prom was killer?literally. For some reason she's been targeted by a dark reaper?yeah, that kind of reaper?intent on getting rid of her, body and soul. But before the reaper could finish the job, Madison was able to snag his strange, glowing amulet and get away.  Now she's stuck on Earth?dead but not gone. Somehow the amulet gives her the illusion of a body, allowing her to toe the line between life and death. She still doesn't know why the dark reaper is after her, but she's not about to just sit around and let fate take its course.  With a little ingenuity, some light-bending, and the help of a light reaper (one of the good guys! Maybe . . . ), her cute crush, and oh yeah, her guardian angel, Madison's ready to take control of her own destiny once and for all, before it takes control of her.

        "Authors": "By Schlesinger, William H.",
        "Description": "For the past 4 billion years, the chemistry of the Earth's surface, where all life exists, has changed remarkably. Historically, these changes have occurred slowly enough to allow life to adapt and evolve. In more recent times, the chemistry of the Earth is being altered at a staggering rate, fueled by industrialization and an ever-growing human population. Human activities, from the rapid consumption of resources to the destruction of the rainforests and the expansion of smog-covered cities, are all leading to rapid changes in the basic chemistry of the Earth.The Second Edition of Biogeochemistry considers the effects of life on the Earth's chemistry on a global level. This expansive text employs current technology to help students extrapolate small-scale examples to the global level, and also discusses the instrumentation being used by NASA and its role in studies of global change. With the Earth's changing chemistry as the focus, this text pulls together the many disparate fields that are encompassed by the broad reach of biogeochemistry. With extensive cross-referencing of chapters, figures, and tables, and an interdisciplinary coverage of the topic at hand, this text will provide an excellent framework for courses examining global change and environmental chemistry, and will also be a useful self-study guide.* Emphasizes the effects of life on the basic chemistry of the atmosphere, the soils, and seawaters of the Earth* Calculates and compares the effects of industrial emissions, land clearing, agriculture, and rising population on Earths chemistry* Synthesizes the global cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur, and suggests the best current budgets for atmospheric gases such as ammonia, nitrous oxide, dimethyl sulfide, and carbonyl sulfide* Includes an extensive review and up-to-date synthesis of the current literature on the Earths biogeochemistry",

        "Description": "When Amanda first came to Dr. Sachs for treatment, she had attempted suicide more than once. Withdrawn and cynical, she refused to speak during her therapy sessions. Determined to connect, Dr. Sachs tried something unconventional: he wrote letters to Amanda between sessions and invited her to write back, thinking she might feel more comfortable opening up in this way\u2014and indeed she did. This correspondence gradually built trust between them, helping her to survive and ultimately to heal.When No One Understands consists of twenty letters that Dr. Sachs wrote to Amanda over the course of her therapy. In these letters, Sachs reaches out to Amanda with the core message that there is nothing wrong with her\u2014that adolescence is painful, complex, and challenging for everyone and that her emotional pain deserves to be honored, openly explored, and viewed with compassion. Dr. Sachs also addresses many of the common questions and concerns shared by all teens on such topics as relationships, breakups, drugs and alcohol, parents, family dynamics, and more. Along the way, Dr. Sachs offers adults an inspiring image of a truly open, human-to-human relationship between an adult and a teenager. Parents, mental health professionals, guidance counselors, educators, and others who work with teens will see how they might also bring honesty, compassion, and humility to bear in their interactions with young people in order to create truly healing and supportive relationships.",

Joy Harkness had built a university career and a safe life in New York, protected and insulated from the intrusions and involvements of other people. When offered a position at Amherst College, she impulsively leaves the city, and along with generations of material belongings, she packs her equally heavy emotional baggage. A tumbledown Victorian house proves an unlikely choice for a woman whose family heirlooms have been boxed away for years. Nevertheless, this white elephant becomes the home that changes Joy forever.

Amid the half-wanted attention of the campus\u2019s single, middle-aged men, known as \u201cthe Coyotes,\u201dand the legitimate dramas of her close-knit community, Joy learns that the key to the affection of family and friends is being worthy of it, and most important, that second chances are waiting to be discovered within us all.",

        "Description": "A highly original, stirring book on Mahatma Gandhi that deepens our sense of his achievements and disappointments\u2014his success in seizing India\u2019s imagination and shaping its independence struggle as a mass movement, his recognition late in life that few of his followers paid more than lip service to his ambitious goals of social justice for the country\u2019s minorities, outcasts, and rural poor.Pulitzer Prize\u2013winner Joseph Lelyveld shows in vivid, unmatched detail how Gandhi\u2019s sense of mission, social values, and philosophy of nonviolent resistance were shaped on another subcontinent\u2014during two decades in South Africa\u2014and then tested by an India that quickly learned to revere him as a Mahatma, or \u201cGreat Soul,\u201d while following him only a small part of the way to the social transformation he envisioned. The man himself emerges as one of history\u2019s most remarkable self-creations, a prosperous lawyer who became an ascetic in a loincloth wholly dedicated to political and social action. Lelyveld leads us step-by-step through the heroic\u2014and tragic\u2014last months of this selfless leader\u2019s long campaign when his nonviolent efforts culminated in the partition of India, the creation of Pakistan, and a bloodbath of ethnic cleansing that ended only with his own assassination. India and its politicians were ready to place Gandhi on a pedestal as \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d but were less inclined to embrace his teachings. Muslim support, crucial in his rise to leadership, soon waned, and the oppressed untouchables\u2014for whom Gandhi spoke to Hindus as a whole\u2014produced their own leaders. Here is a vital, brilliant reconsideration of Gandhi\u2019s extraordinary struggles on two continents, of his fierce but, finally, unfulfilled hopes, and of his ever-evolving legacy, which more than six decades after his death still ensures his place as India\u2019s social conscience\u2014and not just India\u2019s.",

Suze Orman, the woman millions of Americans have turned to for financial advice, says it\u2019s time for a serious reconsideration of the American Dream\u2014what promise it still holds, what aspects are in need of revision, and how it must be refashioned to fit our lives so that we can once again have faith that our hard work will pay off and that a secure and hopeful future is within our reach.\u00a0In nine electrifying chapters, Orman delivers a master class on personal finance for this pivotal moment in time.

        "Description": "With unequaled insight and brio, David Brooks, the New York Times columnist and bestselling author of Bobos in Paradise, has long explored and explained the way we live. Now, with the intellectual curiosity and emotional wisdom that make his columns among the most read in the nation, Brooks turns to the building blocks of human flourishing in a multilayered, profoundly illuminating work grounded in everyday life.This is the story of how success happens. It is told through the lives of one composite American couple, Harold and Erica\u2014how they grow, push forward, are pulled back, fail, and succeed. Distilling a vast array of information into these two vividly realized characters, Brooks illustrates a fundamental new understanding of human nature. A scientific revolution has occurred\u2014we have learned more about the human brain in the last thirty years than we had in the previous three thousand. The unconscious mind, it turns out, is most of the mind\u2014not a dark, vestigial place but a creative and enchanted one, where most of the brain\u2019s work gets done. This is the realm of emotions, intuitions, biases, longings, genetic predispositions, personality traits, and social norms: the realm where character is formed and where our most important life decisions are made. The natural habitat of The Social Animal. Drawing on a wealth of current research from numerous disciplines, Brooks takes Harold and Erica from infancy to school; from the \u201codyssey years\u201d that have come to define young adulthood to the high walls of poverty; from the nature of attachment, love, and commitment, to the nature of effective leadership. He reveals the deeply social aspect of our very minds and exposes the bias in modern culture that overemphasizes rationalism, individualism, and IQ. Along the way, he demolishes conventional definitions of success while looking toward a culture based on trust and humility.The Social Animal is a moving and nuanced intellectual adventure, a story of achievement and a defense of progress. Impossible to put down, it is an essential book for our time, one that will have broad social impact and will change the way we see ourselves and the world.",

        "Authors": "By Baer, Robert and Baer, Dayna",
        "Description": "Robert Baer was known inside the CIA as perhaps the best operative working the Middle East. Over several decades he served everywhere from Iraq to New Delhi and racked up such an impressive list of accomplishments that he was eventually awarded the Career Intelligence Medal.  But if his career was everything a spy might aspire to, his personal life was a brutal illustration of everything a spy is asked to sacrifice. Bob had few enduring non-work friendships, only contacts and acquaintances. His prolonged absences destroyed his marriage, and he felt intense guilt at spending so little time with his children. Sworn to secrecy and constantly driven by ulterior motives, he was a man apart wherever he went. Dayna Williamson thought of herself as just an ordinary California girl -- admittedly one born into a comfortable lifestyle.  But she was always looking to get closer to the edge.  When she joined the CIA, she was initially tasked with Agency background checks, but the attractive Berkeley graduate quickly distinguished herself as someone who could thrive in the field, and she was eventually assigned to \u201cProtective Operations\u201d training where she learned to handle weapons and explosives and conduct high-speed escape and evasion. Tapped to serve in some of the world's most dangerous places, she discovered an inner strength and resourcefulness she'd never known -- but she also came to see that the spy life exacts a heavy toll.  Her marriage crumbled, her parents grew distant, and she lost touch with friends who'd once meant everything to her. When Bob and Dayna met on a mission in Sarajevo, it wasn't love at first sight. They were both too jaded for that. But there was something there, a spark. And as the danger escalated and their affection for each other grew, they realized it was time to leave \u201cthe Company,\u201d to somehow rediscover the people they\u2019d once been. As worldly as both were, the couple didn\u2019t realize at first that turning in their Agency I.D. cards would not be enough to put their covert past behind.  The fact was, their clandestine relationships remained.  Living as \u201ccivilians\u201d in conflict-ridden Beirut, they fielded assassination proposals, met with Arab sheiks, wily oil tycoons, terrorists, and assorted outlaws \u2013 and came perilously close to dying.  But even then they couldn\u2019t know that their most formidable challenge lay ahead. Simultaneously a trip deep down the intelligence rabbit hole \u2013 one that shows how the \u201cgame\u201d actually works, including the compromises it asks of those who play by its rules -- and a portrait of two people trying to regain a normal life, The Company We Keep is a masterly depiction of the real world of shadows.",

        "Description": "\"This book is a final act of posthumous loyalty. Without it, history will have an incomplete -- and I believe unbalanced -- picture of the remarkable man who was the sixteenth chief justice of the United States, a man I was proud to call my friend.\"  ? ? ?   The impact of Chief Justice William Rehnquist -- who served as a Supreme Court justice for a third of a century and headed the federal judiciary under four presidents -- cannot be overstated. His dissenting opinion in Roe v. Wade, and his strongly stated positions on issues as various as freedom of the press, school prayer, and civil rights, would guarantee his memory on their own. Chiefly, though, William Rehnquist will always be remembered for his highly visible role in two of the most important and contentious political events of recent American history: the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999 and the Supreme Court's decision that made George W. Bush the victor in the presidential election of 2000.   Despite his importance as a public figure, however, William Rehnquist scrupulously preserved his private life. And while his judicial opinions often inflamed passions and aroused both ire and praise, they were rarely personal. The underlying quirks, foibles, and eccentricities of the man were always under wraps.   Now, however, journalist Herman J. Obermayer has broken that silence in a memoir of their nineteen-year friendship that is both factually detailed and intensely moving, his own personal tribute to his dearest friend. In these pages, we meet for the first time William Rehnquist the man, in a portrait that can only serve to enhance the legacy of a Chief Justice who will be remembered in history as being among America's most influential.",

        "Description": "From Ragtime and Billy Bathgate to World\u2019s Fair, The March, and Homer & Langley, the fiction of E. L. Doctorow comprises a towering achievement in modern American letters. Now Doctorow returns with an enthralling collection of brilliant, startling short fiction about people who, as the author notes in his Preface, are somehow \u201cdistinct from their surroundings\u2014people in some sort of contest with the prevailing world\u201d. A man at the end of an ordinary workday, extracts himself from his upper-middle-class life and turns to foraging in the same affluent suburb where he once lived with his family. A college graduate takes a dishwasher\u2019s job on a whim, and becomes entangled in a criminal enterprise after agreeing to marry a beautiful immigrant for money. A husband and wife\u2019s tense relationship is exacerbated when a stranger enters their home and claims to have grown up there. An urbanite out on his morning run suspects that the city in which he\u2019s lived all his life has transmogrified into another city altogether. These are among the wide-ranging creations in this stunning collection, resonant with the mystery, tension, and moral investigation that distinguish the fiction of E. L. Doctorow. Containing six unforgettable stories that have never appeared in book form, and a selection of previous Doctorow classics, All the Time in the World affords us another opportunity to savor the genius of this American master.",

Twiss listens to the birds' heartbeats, assessing what she can fix and what she can't, while Milly listens to the heartaches of the people who've brought them. These spinster sisters have spent their lives nursing people and birds back to health. But back in the summer of 1947, Milly and Twiss knew nothing about trying to mend what had been accidentally broken. Milly was known as a great beauty with emerald eyes and Twiss was a brazen wild child who never wore a dress or did what she was told. That was the summer their golf pro father got into an accident that cost him both his swing and his charm, and their mother, the daughter of a wealthy jeweler, finally admitted their hardscrabble lives wouldn't change. It was the summer their priest, Father Rice, announced that God didn't exist and ran off to Mexico, and a boy named Asa finally caught Milly's eye. And, most unforgettably, it was the summer their cousin Bett came down from a town called Deadwater and changed the course of their lives forever. Rebecca Rasmussen's masterfully written debut novel is full of hope and beauty, heartbreak and sacrifice, love and the power of sisterhood, and offers wonderful surprises at every turn.",

        "Description": "In July 1883, just a few days after the twentieth anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, a group of editors at The Century Magazine engaged in a lively argument: Which Civil War battle was the bloodiest battle of them all? One claimed it was Chickamauga, another Cold Harbor. The argument inspired a brainstorm: Why not let the magazine\u2019s 125,000 readers in on the conversation by offering \u201ca series of papers on some of the great battles of the war to be written by officers in command on both sides.\u201d  The articles would be written by generals, Union and Confederate alike, who had commanded the engagements two decades earlier\u2014\u201cor, if he were not living,\u201d by \u201cthe person most entitled to speak for him or in his place.\u201d The pieces would present both sides of each major battle, and would be fair and free of politics. In commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, the most enduring entries from the classic four-volume series Battles and Leaders of the Civil War have now been edited and merged into one definitive volume. Here are the best of the immortal first-person accounts of the Civil War originally published in the pages of The Century Magazine more than a hundred years ago. Hearts Touched by Fire offers stunning accounts of the war\u2019s great battles written by the men who planned, fought, and witnessed them, from leaders such as General Ulysses S. Grant, General George McClellan, and Confederate captain Clement Sullivane to men of lesser rank. This collection also features new year-by-year introductions by esteemed historians, including James M. McPherson, Craig L. Symonds, and James I. Robertson, Jr., who cast wise modern eyes on the cataclysm that changed America and would go down as the bloodiest conflict in our nation\u2019s history. No one interested in our country\u2019s past will want to be without this collection of the most popular and influential first-person Civil War memoirs ever published.",

It contradicts much popular thinking about how to lead a long, healthy and happy life, and it does so based on scientifically grounded arguments and research which shows that the key to good health, success and longevity is the CONSERVATION of life energy.On the basis of the scientifically recognized Metabolic Theory, this book develops a program that can work for everyone. It explains the scientific correlation between life energy and longevity in an easy-to-understand way. The authors have found through their research that older but hearty and active people often do not follow the regimen we have believed was the secret to a long life. They are calm in every situation; they enjoy life, play sports in moderation, eat little and do not waste their valuable life energy. They are not excessively ambitious. All this seems to be the secret to vitality and good health.The book contains valuable tips and advice for everyone who wants to stay healthy and live longer, energy-saving suggestions about eating, working and exercising, and quizzes to test your stress level, life energy and physical well-being.",

And every square inch was being devotedly restored to its original splendor\u2014even as a relationship fell to pieces.

The final tenant is Marya, a celebrated cookbook author hoping to start a new chapter in her life after the death of her husband. As Francesca\u2019s art gallery begins to find its footing and Todd moves on to another woman, she discovers that her accidental tenants have become the most important people in her life. As the roommates bond, and the house fills with the aroma of Marya\u2019s exquisite cuisine, there are shadows as well as light. Na\u00efve Eileen explores the precarious boundaries of online dating with a series of strangers. Chris\u2019s custody fight for his son escalates to devastating levels. Marya faces an unexpected choice that will take her into untested waters. And Francesca herself will contemplate what had seemed impossible: opening her heart once more.Over the course of one amazing, unforgettable, ultimately life-changing year, the house at 44 Charles Street fills with laughter, heartbreak, and, always, hope.

        "Description": "Pierre Franey: embodiment of the art and the pleasures of French cookery, and for four decades one of the most influential and beloved of America's culinary figures. His memoir reflects his relish for life as well as his mastery of his profession.Before he created his \"60-Minute Gourmet\" column in the New York Times, before he wrote his celebrated (and best-selling) cookbooks, and before he entered our homes via television, Pierre Franey presided over the cuisine at two of the greatest French restaurants ever to be opened in America - as executive chef first of the legendary Le Pavillon, then of La Cote Basque.And now, with style, charm and affection for his native France and adopted America, Franey takes us into his life in the world of food, interweaving his story with irresistible recipes and, here and there, impulsively giving away a chef's secrets.He takes us into his childhood in Burgundy, where the bountiful produce and the high respect accorded to the preparation of food grounded Franey in a tradition that would serve him well when he began his apprenticeship at age fourteen in Paris restaurants - the first level of his classical training.The lessons he learned there - the simple artistry that results in a fine omelette, the importance of a well-organized kitchen, the esthetics of texture and color and combination of flavors - are as valuable today as ever. And as Franey reveals the essence of French country food - civet de lapin, boeuf en daube, sole meuniere - we begin to understand cooking fundamentals as the masters do.Franey escorts us around prewar Paris as he tells the story of his coming of age in (and out of) the kitchen, and of his true professional beginnings at the fabled Drouant. He shows us the great 1939 New York World's Fair, where Le Pavillon was born. He relives the days of America's French food revolution and speaks with gusto about such celebrated culinary figures as the incomparable Henri Soule, and Craig Claiborne, his longtime collaborator. He has written a book that charms while it adds immeasurably to our sophistication about the great world of French cooking - and about cooking itself.",

The Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC, comprise the Smithsonian Institution's national museums of Asian art. The two museums are physically linked and also ideologically linked in their commitment to the study, exhibition and preservation of Asian art. The Freer Gallery also contains an important collection ofnineteenth-century American art, featuring James McNeill Whistler's fantastic blue-and-gold Peacock Room, perhaps one of the earliest art installations on record. Sections on the museums' conservation and scientific research activities, archives and libraries highlight the Galleries' scholarly undertakings.\"--Publisher's description.",

The Dark Path introduced a new alien force into the delicate balance of power \u00bf one that was the actual puppetmaster of the human-zor war and now wishes to bring both worlds under its madness inducing shadow. But the same ancient philosophy of the zor race that prophesized \"the Dark Wing\" has also foreseen a hero that will meet the new menace - a hero now mystically embodied in a rebellious space commodore by the name of Jackie Lappierre. As armadas clash and outposts fall, the overly confident alien menace is forced to confront a zor human alliance that has been warned, their covert and insidious plans of infiltration now exposed. \u00bf though victory is hardly ascertained for either side in The Dark Ascent.",

        "Description": "Is your child a spendthrift? A hoarder? Or maybe, downright oblivious? Are there family money dramas you can do without? In RAISING FINANCIALLY FIT KIDS, Joline Godfrey, one of the country?s leading experts on kids, parents, and money, gives parents the secrets and knowledge she has gleaned from a decade of working with kids on financial literacy and business. At the heart of the book lies a defined set of values:Money is a tool for achieving and maintaining independence. Saving is good; accumulation for its own sake is not. Spending is best done wisely and within one?s means (though a bold purchase or investment may also be an act of wisdom). Greed is not good. Giving generously is part of one?s responsibility to the human family; shepherding wealth is an act of respect?to the past and the future. Money is an energy (not a commodity) that can be used for evil or for good.Designed for adults?parents, grandparents, mentors, advisors, and educators?concerned about raising children ages 5 to 18, RAISING FINANCIALLY FIT KIDS is centered around a developmental map covering ten specific money skills each child can master by the age of 18 to become a financially secure adult. This map gives parents a step-by-step approach to helping their kids become habitual savers, smart money mangers, and responsible decision makers. More than just a money book, RAISING FINANCIALLY FIT KIDS will help parents send their children into the world as balanced, financially stable individuals and contributing members of both their family and community.",
