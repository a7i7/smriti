        "Authors": "By Miller, Dennis",
        "Description": "In this fourth installment of his acclaimed Rants series, bestselling author, Emmy Award-winning talk-show host, and wisecracking analyst for ABC's Monday Night Football Dennis Miller makes hamburger meat out of society's most sacred cows as only he can, with the kinds of allusions that require high SAT scores -- or at least a smart crib sheet. For instance, in ranting against bureaucrats, Miller notes, \"They may bestride the rest of us like some kind of Cubicle Colossus bellowing, 'I am Ozymandias, Clerk of Clerks! Look on my Files, ye Mighty, and despair!' All ye who enter here.\"Long before he became America's most-beloved, most-trusted, and most-heckled network football analyst, Miller was an expert commentator on another violent full-contact sport: American pop culture. His gridiron work is merely a sideline, a diversion from his life's mission: to flagellate the fat cats and to punish the puny-minded pundits.This time around, Miller takes on child stars with rap sheets, women with bigger muscles than his own, herbs you don't smoke, God, and, yes, football. As always, nothing is out of bounds. And don't feel guilty for laughing -- these rants are actually good for you. (They provide your daily irony supplement.) Hilarious, sometimes angry, always insightful, The Rant Zone is Miller's most provocative book to date. With Dennis Miller calling the signals, the comedy always goes deep.",

His own wife is dark-skinned, but that is no shield when she is afflicted with a curse meant for her husband. When her affliction cannot be exorcised, their ten-year-old son must be sent to England. There he will become a minister as hardhearted as his father, his missionary zeal directed against the demons he senses in the world around him. His son, however, will not have the same unforgiving strength: a poet possessed by his own demons, he will end his life wandering the halls of Bedlam.",

Small wonder, then, that the golden age of crime fiction has seen a feast of stories in which murder features prominently on the menu. From the breakfast porridge laced with arsenic to the bedtime cocoa doctored with strychnine, no meal has escaped the determined killer. Country house parties have had a predilection for weedkiller, while many a restaurant specialty has concealed a deadly dose of cyanide in the delicately flavored sauce.Poison is not the only weapon chosen by the mealtime murderer. Guns, knives, and the good old-fashioned blunt instrument have all been used to strike down the unsuspecting victim.",

Scarred by the failure of a recent relationship, and haunted by the violent death of his alcoholic mother, Adam finds himself cut adrift in the city of West Hollywood. Determined to expose the facts behind the suicide of the Marine pilot, he discovers that his estranged lover has vanished without a trace, and that his disappearance matches several other recent missing persons cases. Working with his new boss, James Wilton - a famously curmudgeonly mystery novelist with his own battle scars, who is eager for a new case to write about - Adam begins to suspect a serial killer is preying on the city's young gay men.Meanwhile, Caroline Hughes, an intense young surgical resident, scours central California, also seeking a serial killer: an avenger of such legendary violence he seems more demon than man.The truth that Adam, Caroline, and James Wilton discover is far more diabolical than they could ever have imagined.From the mansion-strung Hollywood Hills to the drug-ravaged hamlets of the Central Valley, they enter a labyrinth that leads to the darkest core of the human heart - uncovering a conspiracy so extraordinary that it threatens both their sanity and their lives.",

In The Opposite of Fate: A Book of Musings, she explores this legacy, as well as American circumstances, and finds ways to honor the past while creating her own brand of destiny. She discovers answers in everyday actions and attitudes-from writing stories, decorating her house with charms, learning to ski, and living with squirrels, to dealing with three members of her family afflicted with brain disease, surviving natural disasters, and shaking off both family curses and the expectations that she should become a doctor and a concert pianist.  With the same spirit, humor, and magic that characterize her beloved novels, Amy Tan presents a refreshing antidote to the world-weariness and uncertainties we face today, contemplating how things happen-in her own life and beyond-but always returning to the question of fate and its opposites: the choices, charms, influences, attitudes, and lucky accidents that shape us all.",

Rather than simply charting activity, it explores the issues and the influences that have formed this country over the centuries, clarifying our environmental, social, economic, demographic, political, and cultural development.

Nearly 400 color maps, created specially for this volume, help to illustrate the abundant history of the United States, from pre-Columbian times to the present. With text by an acclaimed team of historians, and further enhanced by more than 120 paintings, engravings, and photographs that provide a visual commentary on the country's life and culture, Mapping America's Past is a vibrant and informative history that offers a truly new look at who Americans are.",

The sanctuary of the lakeside cottage she shares with Atlanta detective Joe Quinn and their adopted daughter Jane has been invaded by a killer who\u2019s sent the grimmest of threats: the face of his next victim. To stop him, Eve must put her own life in the balance and question everything and everyone she trusts. Not even Quinn can go where Eve must go this time. As the trail of faceless bodies leads to a chilling revelation, Eve finds herself trying to catch a master murderer whose grisly work is a testament to a mind warped by perversion and revenge. Now she must pit her skills against his in a showdown where the stakes are life itself\u2014and where the unbearable cost of failure will make Eve\u2019s own murder seem like a mercy killing.",

The human nervous system has seven biological responses that correspond to seven levels of divine experience. These are shaped not by any one religion (they are shared by all faiths), but by the brain's need to take an infinite, chaotic universe and find meaning in it. How to Know God describes the quest each of us is on, whether we realize it or not. For, as Chopra puts it, \"God is our highest instinct to know ourselves.\" This book makes a dramatic and enduring contribution to that knowledge.",

Today, more than 100,000 multiple births take place annually, but despite this astonishing statistic, there hasn't been an authoritative reference that adequately focuses on the unique concerns of the parents until now.   Twins! gives parents comprehensive information on the physical, medical, emotional, and psychological issues involved in having twins. The first part of the book covers the pregnancy, birth, and postpartum experience, and discusses a broad range of twin-specific information such as the epidemiology of twinning, fetal and embryonic development, nutritional needs, and exercise. The second section covers the first year of life, discussing such topics as telling the twins apart, size and energy differences, and how to cope with the extra work.   Additional features include discussions with parents of twins, in which they share their experience on a variety of topics; sidebars filled with fascinating facts; a workbook for recording the pregnancies progress; and several appendices.",

        "Authors": "By Cox, Archibald",
        "Description": "The appointment of Earl Warren as Chief Justice of the United States in 1953 marked the opening of a new era in the nation's constitutional development. As Mr. Cox points out in his Preface, during the next fifteen years the Supreme Court rewrote, with profound social consequences, major constitutional doctrines governing race relations, the administration of criminal justice, and the operation of the political process. The extent and the rapidity of these changes raise grave questions concerning the nature and function of constitutional adjudication and the proper role of the Supreme Court in the national life.In these lectures, originally given in somewhat shorter form in Honolulu in the summer of 1967 under the joint auspices of Harvard Law School and the University of Hawaii, Mr. Cox describes the main lines of constitutional development under the Warren Court. He analyzes the underlying pressures involved and the long-range institutional consequences in terms of the distribution of governmental power. The central theme of Mr. Cox's book is embodied in his examination of the American paradox that invests the judicial branch with the responsibility of deciding \"according to law\" our most pressing and divisive social, economic, and political questions.Although not uncritical of the grounds on which several of the court's crucial decisions have been reached, Mr. Cox comes to the conclusion that the trend of the rulings has been \"in keeping with the mainstream of American history--a bit progressive but also moderate, a bit humane but not sentimental, a bit idealistic but seldom doctrinaire, and in the long run essentially pragmatic--in short, in keeping with the true genius of our institutions.\"",

        "Description": "\"Has anyone really stood up against George Bush and his policies? Don't you think it's time somebody did?\"As the 2004 election shifts into primary overdrive, the one candidate who is getting the most ink and air time is former Vermont Governor Howard Dean. His fundraising has skyrocketed past his Democratic opponents and almost a quarter-million people from all fifty states have signed up to volunteer for his campaign.To say Howard Dean is outspoken is something of an understatement. But what is Dean really saying? And why does the media -- and the other Democratic candidates as well as Republicans -- constantly try to paint Dean as an extreme liberal? Howard Dean In His Own Words clearly states the governor's opinions on over 100 issues, from the military to the environment to education. A valuable primer for the politically curious to the most ardent Dean blogger, Howard Dean In His Own Words captures the voice and intellect of one of America's most fascinating political figures.Howard Dean on How to Win the Election:\"The way to beat this president is not to be like him. We have to stand up and give the 50 percent of Americans who don't vote a reason to vote.\"Howard Dean on the Democratic Party:\"When I say that a lot of Democrats are more mad at the Democrats than at the Republicans, I get a lot of nods.\"Howard Dean on Education:\"The single most important factor in how a child learns has less to do with the quality of the building, the computers or even the teachers. The most important predictor is the attitude in that child's home toward education. We must involve the parents again.\"Howard Dean on Being Called a Liberal:\"I think it's pathetic that I'm considered the left-wing liberal. It shows just how far to the right this country has lurched.\"",

Now, in response to new developments in theory and research, as well as changes in service delivery within the field, the second edition contains updated and accessible information on how mental illnesses develop and how they can be treated within a social work framework that recognizes the importance of family, economics, and culture as well as biochemical and psychodynamic factors. Each chapter is written by the leading social work authority on that subject and includes practical, in-depth discussion of state-of-the-art technologies, treatments, and research.",
