        "Description": "In North Carolina the sauce is loaded with vinegar, and hickory smoke is essential. South Carolinians swear by mustard, while Texans insist on tomato sauce and Worcestershire. Author and cook Jane Butel has traveled all across the country to pick up on the passions for America's favorite summertime food: barbecued hamburgers, chicken, ham, duck, ribs and more ribs. From fast and simple Louisiana Down Home Barbecue to Hawaii's slow and delicious Illahee Pork Chops, Butel's recipes are the best and latest from every region. They have been coaxed from friends and relatives, competitors and restaurateurs, from everyone with a good idea-including barbecue champion Jerry Wood and a chauffeur named Anthony who revealed his own glorious concoction (it relies on plum tomatoes) while driving Butel to a barbecue contest. Step-by-step instructions explain Basic Sauce and Butel's Super Secret Recipe. The author remarks on spiciness, and considers the pit-smoking versus smokehouse debate. She lists sources for mail-order supplies, and even provides recipes for side dishes: cole slaw, beans, potato salad, and-to finish things off for good-a sumptuous chocolate double fudge cake.

        "Description": "Ralph Nader is one of America\u2019s most controversial\u2014and uncompromising\u2014 public figures. He is a man on a mission who believes that taking on the powers that be involves more than just talking about it\u2014it also means taking action. From car safety in the 1960s to opposition to the World Trade Organization in the 1990s, Nader\u2019s work has increased government responsiveness to citizens, served as a check against the abuse of power by big business, and shaped the political consciousness of a nation. Nader\u2019s sense of mission is infused in all of his work, especially his weekly columns. In Pursuit of Justice, a collection of Nader\u2019s most recent, trenchant articles written in the years immediately following the publication of The Ralph Nader Reader, Nader addresses a broad array of issues, among them: corporate crime and power, government accountability, media control, consumer rights, healthcare, congressional reform, nuclear power and energy, racial discrimination, poverty, food and drug safety, air and water pollution, fair taxation, product liability protection, union democracy, living family wage, unfair lending practices, community radio, industrial hemp, banking, pension law, telecommunications and the importance of character. Nader has even sponsored consumer initiatives to reform university governance, educational testing, daily newspapers, women's health care, legal services, and professional sports\u2014all of which are reflected in these sharp and sometimes humorous essays.As informative as it is pleasurable to read, section after section of In Pursuit of Justice slices through government and corporate propaganda and reveals the corruption, bias and injustice that all too often connect politics with big business, thereby impeding the pursuit of justice. Collecting more than one hundred of his most recent writings, In Pursuit of Justice conveys Nader's inimitable sense of both the global political economy and our nation's democratic promise.",

He argues that new groups of immigrants such as Asians, Latinos, and African-Americans (here termed new because they've only recently gained legal equality) can be compared to the older immigrant groups of Jews, Italians, and Irish, respectively.  He argues that if these other groups just learn English and assimilate American culture as their metaphorical forebears did, than there are few, if any, barriers to their eventual success in American life.

When a dear old friend dies in a grotesque holiday accident, Jamie is pulled into a homicide investigation in her small New Jersey hometown, and reunited with the friends and secrets she left behind. There's Barclay, now a rich womanizing developer; Pudge, a funny man who owns a local restaurant; Amanda, a gorgeous and promiscuous young widow; and Garth McBride, the boy who broke Jamie's heart. At the funeral Pudge reminds Jamie that the death was mysteriously similar to the murder dreamed up a decade ago by their secret \"killing club,\" formed when they were high school misfits who spent their free time thinking up ingenious ways to murder the people they despised.Seeking the truth about her friend's death, Jamie finds more questions than answers. As she battles her superiors, who tell her the similarity is a mere coincidence, and her own conscience -- as she's not clear which friends to trust -- she discovers that her heart is once again tugged by her feelings for Garth and that the evidence might be leading her to the most horrific truth imaginable.The Killing Club is a suspenseful page-turner that will leave readers riveted -- and hungry for more.",

Much of his book documents the Nixon strategy, which relied on a constant flow of positive news, the sophisticated use of television to evade the press and address viewers directly, and intimidation through classified or censored information. What is particularly startling is Spear's revelation about the extent to which the so-called experts (media specialists, pollsters, and the like) and technology now shape our view of the President. As editor and chief of staff for syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, Joe Spear is primarily responsible for covering diplomatic and foreign affairs and has broken some of the major news stories of our day.",

Still reeling from the bloody showdown where she took the lives of two serial killers, one of whom was her lover, Angela is hell-bent on facing the future. She's enjoying the perks of a well-deserved promotion, as well as getting to know her new boyfriend on a romantic camping trip. All that changes when the FBI interrupts her relaxing getaway and puts her on a complicated high-profile case.Inside a secluded Chesapeake bed-and-breakfast, Dr. Leslie Collins, a prominent African-American obstetrician, has been found dead and mutilated. His white mistress, a Clinton White House advisor, was also dead in their bed, apparently from a poisonous snakebite. And no one at the inn heard or saw a thing. Angela can't help but be shaken to the core - Dr. Collins was a family friend, and now it's up to her to apprehend the killer.Angela's superiors at the Bureau suspect a shadowy white supremacy group that has been terrorizing abortion clinics and liberal leaders, but such tidy motives are soon discredited as other influential Black men from the worlds of business, politics, and religion start to share the doctor's gruesome fate. Angela's quest for justice deepens when she discovers the unlikely connections that link the men to one another, and to Antoine Jones, a convicted murderer on death row. Angela's investigation also uncovers disturbing evidence that these murders are bound to a world of spells and ancient prophecies rooted in South African witchcraft, and of age-old vendettas being played out in a very modern D.C.",

        "Authors": "By Friedman, Michael Jan",
        "Description": "Three hundred years ago, the S.S. Valiant was destroyed during an ill-fated attempt to cross the legendary Galactic Barrier. Starfleet had always assumed that the Valiant had perished with all hands aboard, until a pair of unusual humanoids arrive at Starbase 209, claiming to be the descendants of a handful of Valiant survivors who found refuge on an M-Class planet beyond the Barrier.  Even more shocking, the visitors warn that a hostile alien species, the Nuyyad, are preparing to invade our galaxy. Uncertain of how much of the strangers' story to believe, Starfleet orders the U.S.S. Stargazer to investigate at once.  Lieutenant Commander Jean-Luc Picard is second officer on the Stargazer. A young man who has yet to command a vessel of his own, he soon develops a special bond with one of the visitors, a strikingly beautiful woman who has inherited mysterious psychic abilities from her alleged Starfleet ancestors. But can Picard truly trust her?  His doubts deepen when the Stargazer is ambushed by Nuyyad warships, leaving the captain dead and the first officer incapacitated. Picard suddenly finds himself in command -- and facing immediate danger. Trapped on the wrong side of the Barrier, cut off from Starfleet, he must now rely on questionable allies and a crew uncertain of his abilities. And not only the Stargazer, but perhaps the entire Federation, may depend on the decisions he must make.  The Valiant is a gripping saga that explores an untold chapter in the life of Jean-Luc Picard -- and reveals the making of a captain!",

        "Title": "Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World",
        "Authors": "By Critser, Greg and Crister, Greg",
        "Description": "What in American society has changed so dramatically that nearly 60 percent of us are now overweight, plunging the nation into what the surgeon general calls an \"epidemic of obesity\"? Greg Critser engages every aspect of American life - class, politics, culture, and economics - to show how we have made ourselves the second fattest people on the planet (after South Sea Islanders).Fat Land highlights the groundbreaking research that implicates cheap fats and sugars as the alarming new metabolic factor making our calories stick and shows how and why children are too often the chief metabolic victims of such foods. No one else writing on fat America takes as hard a line as Critser on the institutionalized lies we've been telling ourselves about how much we can eat and how little we can exercise. His expose of the Los Angeles schools' opening of the nutritional floodgates in the lunchroom and his examination of the political and cultural forces that have set the bar on American fitness low and then lower, are both discerning reporting and impassioned wake-up calls.Disarmingly funny, Fat Land leaves no diet book - including Dr. Atkins's - unturned. Fashions, both leisure and street, and American-style religion are subject to Critser's gimlet eye as well. Memorably, Fat Land takes on baby-boomer parenting shibboleths - that young children won't eat past the point of being full and that the dinner table isn't the place to talk about food rules - and gives advice many families will use to lose.Critser's brilliantly drawn futuristic portrait of a Fat America just around the corner and his all too contemporary foray into the diabetes ward of a major children's hospital make Fat Land a chilling but brilliantly rendered portrait of the cost in human lives - many of them very young lives - of America's obesity epidemic.",

        "Description": "England, mid-1580s. Facing an array of international foes and torn internally by religious strife, England finds that its safety depends more than ever on a slight woman of exceptional intellectual brilliance, a master of realpolitik - Queen Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, Gloriana. Elizabeth is revered like a goddess, her stature a shrewd political tool designed to hold her people together. And it's about to be destroyed by a dark revelation from a hidden part of her past.Narrated by a defrocked nun, a poignant victim of Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries, Unicorn's Blood is about a dangerous secret, the existence of a private diary kept by the Queen as a young princess. Should this stolen journal, embroidered with a unicorn that has a ruby for an eye, fall into the wrong hands, its intimate revelations would destroy the entire edifice of Tudor government.On one side are the persecuted Catholic recusants, desperate to bring down their hated tormentor; on the other, Elizabeth's own ruthlessly ambitious spymasters, eager to hold the trump card against the Catholics - and against the Queen. The prize is the key to the real Elizabeth, written at a time when her own life stood in the balance.",

There Hawke considers his cousin Simon Tibeault's job offer to work in his bakery on a small nearby island with a suspect history. Lulled by Sweeney's stories and the comfort of the diner, Hawke misses the only ferry. But, provisioned with doughnuts and Sweeney's map, he sets out anyway across the frozen part of the lake, alone and in failing light.A ruined house, deep in a dark forest, is the first thing he sees after stumbling ashore on the wrong end of the island. It is the glimmer of light beneath the door that brings him closer. Behind the door, he meets tall, redheaded Obdulia Lamb, grieving for her mother, ten years dead.Drawn in by Obdulia's overbearing father and her octogenarian femme fatale of a stepmother, Hawke tries to resist their scheme to involve him in a comic yet gruesome conspiracy to cure Obdulia of her grief.

        "Authors": "By Kelly, Donovan",
        "Description": "From  1997-1999 Donovan Kelly wrote a column for the Washington Post called \"Crummy But Good\" in which he reviewed local eateries that looked dubious from the outside, but that offered something beyond the ordinary on the inside. His popular column, the ongoing radio series (WAMU-FM) and the never-ending suggestions from his legion of \"crummy-but-good\" scouts are brought together for this first compilation of reviews of the 50 best establishments meeting the highly technical crummy-but-good criteria. \"Crummy\" means a place that looks so bad from the outside that you would hesitate to take your mother inside, especially if she were wearing her good dress. \"But Good\" means that, once inside, you find some combination of a good menu, good food, relaxing atmosphere, friendly people, and reasonable prices that makes you want to come back. And maybe bring your smart aleck brother from New Jersey who thinks he\u2019s seen everything.     The restaurants are located in DC, and nearby and not so nearby Maryland and Virginia, and West Virginia. Included is a completely unbiased (?) list of the ten best places as well as a chronicle of the ongoing, ever-controversial Crummy but Good Crabcake War.",

        "Description": "An international best-seller, Alexandra Lapierre's Artemisia sweeps us through the streets once frequented by Caravaggio, Velasquez, and Van Dyck and into the studios of artists who used their daggers as efficiently as their brushes. Born in the early 1600s when artists were the celebrities of the day, Artemisia was apprenticed to her father, the artist Orazio Gentileschi, at an early age. Raped by his partner Agostino Tassi at seventeen, the Gentileschi name was dragged through scandal for Artemisia refused, even when tortured, to deny that she had been raped. Indeed, she went farther: she dared to plead her case in court. Artemisia is the story of a powerful love/hate relationship between master and pupil, father and daughter, and a talent that overturned the prejudices of the day, winning commissions from wealthy patrons, nobles, and kings. Lapierre brings Artemisia Gentileschi to vivid life as she tells of the emotional struggles of the most fascinating and controversial artist of her time.",

She weaves the experiences of individual women together with general social trends, to show, for example, how women's lives were changing in response to the economy and the institutions of property ownership and slavery.By looking at what the Petersburg women did and thought and comparing their behavior with that of men, Lebsock discovers that they placed high value on economic security, on the personal, on the religious, and on the interests of other women. In a society committed to materialism, male dominance, and the maintenance of slavery, their influence was subversive. They operated from an alternative value system, indeed a distinct female culture.",

        "Title": "A Time to Live: Seven Tasks of Creative Aging",
        "Authors": "By Raines, Robert",
        "Description": "In A Time To Live, Robert Raines explores the spiritual and emotional dimensions of what can be the most rewarding time of life. Drawing on his experiences as an ordained minister and as director of a non-denominational retreat center focusing on issues of personal growth, Raines delineates the important passages we must all make from our middle years in the process of growing older. In an approach that is both meditative and inspirational, drawing from a variety of backgrounds, anecdotes, and literature, Raines provides a new perspective on the aging process and its implications. To make the most of this ultimate period of life, he argues, we must each confront certain issues: waking up to mortality, embracing sorrow, savoring blessedness, re-imagining work, nurturing intimacy, seeking forgiveness, and taking on the mysterious process of exploring what is yet to be done in life with a sense of possibility and hope. For the millions of baby boomers just entering their fifties and others approaching their sixties who are determined to be aware and take advantage of the challenges they face, A Time To Live, is the only book to directly address their needs. Sure to be a welcome and important spiritual guide for many, it offers the possibility of fulfillment and personal satisfaction.",
