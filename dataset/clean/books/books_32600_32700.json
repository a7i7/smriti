While Toby is fiercely proud of the stripes she earned as a resident in a big-city ER, she's come to appreciate the pace at Springer. But no hospital could have been prepared for the man Toby admits one quiet night. Delirious and in critical condition from a possible viral infection of the brain, he barely responds to treatment. And then he disappears without a trace.Under fire from the hospital administration for literally losing a patient, and fearful that she's missed a life-threatening diagnosis, Toby knows she must find the patient. Her hunt is intensified when a second delirious patient dies in the hospital's care. But even more chilling is the discovery that the infection can only be spread through direct tissue exchange.",

        "Authors": "By Dale, Jim, Shapiro, Ronald M., Jankowski, Mark A., and Ripkin, Cal (FRW)",
        "Description": "One of the most successful dealmakers in the sports industry presents his unique negotiating strategies\"Ron Shapiro's new book is insightful and entertaining. The lessons he learned and the methods he uses should be required reading for anyone whose business relies on the art of negotiation. Ron never forgets that treating people with respect and fairness is the key to success. Ron and Mark have been helping our company for many years-I guess we won't need them anymore-they put it all in their book.\"\u2014Charles M. Cawley, Chief Executive Officer, MBNA America Bank, N.A.\"In the field of negotiation Ron Shapiro has always been regarded as the quintessence of class and integrity. Predictably, he and Mark Jankowski have written a compelling book filled with anecdotes and insights.The Power of Nice is a fascinating and useful book that is a must read for anyone who wants to build long-term mutually profitable relationships.\"\u2014Herb Cohen, Author, You Can Negotiate Anything\"This book taught me everything I ever wanted to know about negotiation-and I use it everyday.\"\u2014Kirby Puckett, Former All-Star Center Fielder and Executive Vice President, Minnesota Twins\"Negotiation is not war. Negotiation is not a science. Negotiation is the commerce of information for ultimate gain.\"\u2014from The Power of NiceThough not a science, negotiating is an art, and in this eye-opening new book, a true master shares his secrets and strategies for success. Ron Shapiro is a corporate lawyer, teacher, and, in what is almost a contradiction in terms, one of today's most respected sports agents. He has worked with baseball's biggest names: Cal Ripken, Jr., Kirby Puckett, Brooks Robinson, Dennis Martinez, Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray, and many others. Rising to-and remaining at-the top of a competitive pool filled with smooth-talking, \"sleazeball\" sharks, he has succeeded by being, of all things, a nice guy. Now, along with his business partner, lawyer, lecturer, and negotiations expert, Mark Jankowski, Shapiro reveals how anyone who sits down to make a deal can get what they want by exercising the surprising \"power of nice.\" Together, Shapiro and Jankowski have shared their negotiation insights with Fortune 500 companies, entrepreneurs, universities, and government agencies.Though the name of the game in negotiating is to obtain desired results, how you get them is just as important. While many dealmakers play hardball by assuming a winner-take-all, scorched-earth attitude, they do so at the risk of alienating the party opposite them at the negotiating table, thereby losing out on future opportunities. This approach is, as Shapiro and Jankowski tell us, a major strike against effective negotiating, and can-and should-be avoided. By using a kinder, gentler approach that focuses on forming-and keeping-strong business connections, ultimate gain can still be yours: \"You can be 'a nice guy' and still get what you're after. In fact, you often get better results, achieve more of your goals, and build longer-term relationships with even greater returns.\"Drawing on their vast experience in win-win negotiating, as well as such essentials as managing tough situations, handling difficult negotiators, and unlocking deadlocks, the authors take you, step-by-step, through a systematic approach that, when repeated and mastered, will maximize results. Based on \"the three Ps,\" it consists of: preparing better than the other side; probing so you know what they want and why; and proposing, ideally without going first and revealing too much, but still achieving what you want.Supported by invaluable \"portable\" negotiation summaries-so you can take the \"power of nice\" with you-this is must reading for anyone who has to make a deal, whether it's negotiating with a customer, s",

InThe Gifts of the Jews Thomas Cahill takes us on another enchanting journey into history, once again recreating a time when the actions of a small band of people had repercussions that are still felt today.The Gifts of the Jews reveals the critical change that made western civilization possible. Within the matrix of ancient religions and philosophies, life was seen as part of an endless cycle of birth and death; time was like a wheel, spinning ceaselessly. Yet somehow, the ancient Jews began to see time differently. For them, time had a beginning and an end; it was a narrative, whose triumphant conclusion would come in the future. From this insight came a new conception of men and women as individuals with unique destinies--a conception that would inform the Declaration of Independence--and our hopeful belief in progress and the sense that tomorrow can be better than today. As Thomas Cahill narrates this momentous shift, he also explains the real significance of such Biblical figures as Abraham and Sarah, Moses and the Pharaoh, Joshua, Isaiah, and Jeremiah.Full of compelling stories, insights and humor, The Gifts of the Jews is an irresistible exploration of history as fascinating and fun asHow the Irish Saved Civilization.",

        "Authors": "By Picoult, Jodi",
        "Description": "Jodi Picoult, the New York Times bestselling author of Vanishing Acts, offers her most powerful chronicle yet of an American family with a story that probes the unbreakable bond between parent and child -- and the dangerous repercussions of trying to play the hero.  Trixie Stone is fourteen years old and in love for the first time. She's also the light of her father's life -- a straight-A student; a freshman in high school who is pretty and popular; a girl who's always looked up to Daniel Stone as a hero. Until, that is, her world is turned upside down with a single act of violence...and suddenly everything Trixie has believed about her family -- and herself -- seems to be a lie.   For fifteen years, Daniel Stone has been an even-tempered, mild-mannered man: a stay-at-home dad to Trixie and a husband who has put his own career as a comic book artist behind that of his wife, Laura, who teaches Dante's Inferno at a local college. But years ago, he was completely different: growing up as the only white boy in an Eskimo village, he was teased mercilessly for the color of his skin. He learned to fight back: stealing, drinking, robbing, and cheating his way out of the Alaskan bush. To become part of a family, he reinvented himself, channeling his rage onto the page and burying his past completely...until now. Could the young boy who once made Trixie's face fill with light when he came to the door have been the one to end her childhood forever? She says that he is, and that is all it takes to make Daniel, a man with a history he has hidden even from his family, venture to hell and back in order to protect his daughter.   The Tenth Circle looks at that delicate moment when a child learns that her parents don't know all of the answers and when being a good parent means letting go of your child. It asks whether you can reinvent yourself in the course of a lifetime or if your mistakes are carried forever -- if life is, as in any good comic book, a struggle to control good and evil, or if good and evil control you.",

Barely escaping with her life, the sexy, stylish thirty-two-year-old brunette calls the police and finds herself face-to-face with FBI agent Sam McCabe. Unnerved by his questions-and his good looks-Maddie is told she's been targeted by a hired killer, one who has eluded McCabe for years.  Apparently, she's been mistaken for another woman, an FBI informant of the same name who was also staying at the hotel that night. McCabe grills her, and then disappears. Shaken, she finishes her business and returns home to St. Louis.  But days later, Maddie is attacked a second time, and again McCabe returns to question her. He convinces her that the only way she'll ever be safe again is if the killer is caught, and the quickest way to nab him is to use her as bait. Maddie reluctantly agrees, and sparks fly and then ignite as McCabe shadows her. But their unexpected romance throws McCabe off his stride-and puts Maddie in the hands of a killer.  A bewitching combination of pulse-pounding twists and blazing romance, Bait is the remarkable Karen Robards at her best.",

Throughout her harrowing ordeal, Melba was taunted by her schoolmates and their parents, threatened by a lynch mob\u2019s rope, attacked with lighted sticks of dynamite, and injured by acid sprayed in her eyes. But through it all, she acted with dignity and courage, and refused to back down. Warriors Don\u2019t Cry is, at times, a difficult but necessary reminder of the valuable lessons we can learn from our nation\u2019s past. It is a story of courage and the bravery of a handful of young, black students who used their voices to influence change during a turbulent time.",

For three years, Mary Pipher dedicated herself to understanding the experience of coming to America. And the people who spring  to life on the pages of this book become as real to the reader as neighbors and friends. Never again will you pass an exotic looking newcomer and see them as a stranger. The stories of these newcomers and their hair-raising escapes, their hopes and the speed of their adjustment to 21st century America, help us to see our country through fresh eyes. Pipher shows us the effects of trauma on identity, and she identifies the characteristics of strong people who can survive terrible events, and then go on to build better lives. These are the lessons we can learn from the people who speak in this book: a better understanding of who we are, and a richer understanding of where we are. The gifts of the refugees are manifold. Their stories will make you laugh and weep--and give you a deeper understanding of the wider world in which we live.  Our new Americans are experiencing the age-old, mythic journey from slavery to freedom, and the ups and downs of arriving in the promised land. Mary Pipher tells these stories, and their great lessons, as only she can.",

        "Description": "Throughout history women have traditionally passed along their knowledge of womanhood to their daughters, who in turn entrusted their own daughters with these precious secrets. Sadly, it is a tradition lost. But at what cost?In this powerful book, Debra Evans eloquently and clearly presents what thousands of pages of research document: women's health care is in crisis. She details how medical \"experts\" have taken the place of mothers and grandmothers. How the womb has been rendered optional for procreation now that new techniques allow life to begin in a petrie dish. How doctors are \"liberating\" women from their biological, God-designed destiny and are disregarding medical and moral norms at the expense of their patients' emotions, finances, and bodies. And how, as the traditional domain of women has become the technical domain of doctors, our reproductive competency and dependence on God has increasingly eroded and been sabotaged by our trust in medical professionals and their technology.But Evans also reminds us of a better way. One that understands God's wonderful plan for sexuality and childbearing-- and realizes that therein lies the greatest hope for women.",

        "Description": "In May 2001, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) broke a major pizza story on the ABC television program 20/20 and once again captured front-page headlines, just as it did when it released studies on movie popcorn and take-out Chinese food. In Restaurant Confidential, Dr. Michael F. Jacobson and his CSPI team do for sit-down meals what their Fast-Food Guide--with 247,000 copies in print--did for fast food. Belgian Waffle or Rib-Eye Steak? Bloomin' Onion or Mrs. Fields's Double-Fudge Brownie? Americans are now eating almost one-third of their meals outside the home, spending $222 billion annually doing so-and watching their waistlines balloon. What's in this food? To answer, CSPI performs across-the-board restaurant profiles that give straight-shooting scientific data on the fat, sodium, and calorie content of the most popular dishes. The information is organized by type of cuisine--Chinese, Mexican, steak house, and more--and covers all the major chains, such as The Olive Garden, Applebee's, and Outback. The book provides specific eating strategies for every kind of restaurant, as well as shocking facts: Did you know that a typical order of stuffed potato skins packs a whopping 1,260 calories and 48 grams--two days' worth--of saturated fat? A 10-point plan for ordering wisely, plus dozens of tips throughout, takes the information one step further by showing how to eat happily and healthfully. It's the nutrition book that reads like a thriller. Take the steak and brownies; a whole fried onion with dipping sauce has a blooming 163 grams of fat, and the seemingly innocent Belgian waffle with whipped topping and fruit has even more fat and calories than two sirloin steaks.",

        "Title": "Ancient Egypt",
        "Authors": "By Silverman, David P. (EDT)",
        "Description": "The ancient Egyptians lived in a remarkable culture that created some of the world's most beautiful art and architecture. It was a land where Pharaoh was the monarch of the entire world, the living emodiment on Earth of the god Horus, son of Osiris, ruler of the underworld. It was a culture that relied on the rising and falling of the Nile, but resided next to the Great Sahara, one of the hottest and driest deserts on the planet. Even today, the ancient civilization of Egypt--which produced the great pyramids, the riddle of the Sphinx, and the riches of Tutankhamum--exerts a strong hold on our imaginations. Now, in Ancient Egypt, eminent Egyptologist David P. Silverman and a team of leading scholars explore the cultural wealth of this civilization in a series of intriguing and authoritative essays based on the latest theories and discoveries. Illustrated with more than 200 superb color photographs, maps, and charts, Ancient Egypt illuminates the vivid and powerful symbolic images of this fascinating culture--from pyramids and temples to priests and rituals; from hieroglyphic writing to daily life by the Nile; and from temple carvings to the cult of the dead. Correcting the popular misconception of the Egyptians as a death-obsessed people, the book uses the most recent historical research and archaeological finds to illuminate the routines of daily life in royal, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlite, and priestly circles, as well as at lower levels of society. We learn, for example, that despite the monochromatic appearance of most temple ruins today, in ancient times they would have been colorful, even gleaming structures; that the title \"Pharaoh\" derives from the Egyptian phrase per aa, which means \"great house\" and was originally a reference to the royal palace; that temples employed all manner of part-time and full-time personnel, from farmers and carpenters to scribes, jewellers, and keepers of livestock; and that Egyptian law viewed women as equal to men, and they could, in some cases, wield considerable influence. Lavishly illustrated with beautiful color artwork, Ancient Egypt is an authoritative and accessible guide to the many dimensions of the ancient Egyptian world.",

        "Description": "Written by a premier group of thinkers from around the world, Alternatives to Economic Globalization is the defining document of the antiglobalization movement. It presents both a sober critique of globalization as well as practical, thoughtful alternatives.The authors assert ten core requirements for democratic societies, including equality, basic human rights, local decision making, and ecological sustainability, and demonstrate how globalization undermines each. Offering specific strategies for reining in corporate domination, they address alternative systems for energy, agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing; ideas for weakening or dismantling the WTO, World Bank, and IMF; and rebuilding economies that are responsive to human needs.",

        "Description": "The inspiring, true coming-of-age story of a ferociously determined young man who, armed only with his intellect and his willpower, fights his way out of despair.In 1993, Cedric Jennings was a bright and ferociously determined honor student   at Ballou, a high school in one of Washington D.C.\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods,   where the dropout rate was well into double digits and just 80 students out of more   than 1,350 boasted an average of B or better. At Ballou, Cedric had almost no friends.   He ate lunch in a classroom most days, plowing through the extra work he asked   for, knowing that he was really competing with kids from other, harder schools. Cedric   Jennings\u2019s driving ambition\u2014which was fully supported by his forceful mother\u2014was to   attend a top college. In September 1995, after years of near superhuman dedication,   he realized that ambition when he began as a freshman at Brown University. But he didn't leave his struggles behind. He found himself unprepared for college: he struggled to master classwork and fit in with the white upper-class students.\u00a0Having traveled too far to turn back, Cedric was left to rely on his intelligence and his determination to maintain hope in the unseen\u2014a future of acceptance and reward.In this   updated edition, A Hope in the Unseen chronicles Cedric\u2019s odyssey during his last   two years of high school, follows him through his difficult first year at Brown,   and tells the story of his subsequent successes in college and the world of work.\u00a0Eye-opening, sometimes humorous, and often deeply moving,\u00a0A Hope in the Unseen\u00a0weaves a crucial new thread into the rich and ongoing narrative of the American experience.",
