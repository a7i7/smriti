Their solution would allow people the freedom to invest their FICA taxes in financial assets that more than meet retirement needs at a fraction of Social Security's cost.Under their plan, financial security for all retirees would be more certain, worker's taxes would be cut, and the nation's staggering unfunded Social Security liability would drop by 60 percent. Disability and hospital insurance would continue as they are - neither would be altered even slightly.Promises to Keep is not a doomsday book. Nor is it a jargon-filled economics text. Rather, it is a book that points to a secure future for all Americans.",

Maverick journalists and filmmakers Max Wallace and Jonathan Goldstein have proven it. Schmelvis: In Search of Elvis Presley's Jewish Roots is a behind-the-scenes account of their irreverent and witty film documentary. With the help of a Hasidic Jewish Elvis impersonator and an eccentric Orthodox Rabbi, they trace Elvis's Jewish roots, all the way to Israel. Next? Bring the good news back home to Graceland! This wacky crew pilots the \"Winnebagel\" on a pilgrimage down America's legendary Highway 61 to the home of the King, and along the way they share the startling truth with Elvis' own disciples, rednecks, truckers, white trash and plain old unsuspecting Americans. Schmelvis: In Search of Elvis Presley's Jewish Roots compiles the journals of the filmmakers, production logs, selections from the film script, trivia, and a private investigator's official report on Elvis's Jewish roots. Finally, it has Aunty Pearly's original recipe for kosher peanut butter and banana sandwiches: Elvis's favourite.",

A talented photographer, she creates happy memories for others - videotaping weddings, splicing together scenes of smiling faces, editing out the awkward moments. But she cannot edit her own memories so easily - images of a childhood career as her father's model and muse, the subject of his celebrated series of controversial photographs. And so Ann escapes into a secret life: She hides in the bathroom, takes speed, and shoplifts.In razor-sharp prose - The New York Times described her writing as \"hallucinatory, poetic\" - Kathryn Harrison shows how patterns of exploitation in the past form a psychological trap for Ann, a trap that closes tighter and tighter, until it finally threatens to destroy her. When the Museum of Modern Art announces a retrospective of her father's disturbing portraits, Ann's carefully controlled balance on the edge of self-destruction slips.Like Thicker Than Water, Kathryn Harrison's previous novel, Exposure illuminates how a desperate struggle for identity, for self, and for self-respect can go under the surface of what seems like a successful life. And like Thicker Than Water, Exposure is sure to be praised as \"beautifully written, unsparingly honest\" (The New York Times Book Review) and \"devastating...remarkable\" (The New York Times).",

Anne-Sophie is a proper young Frenchwoman engaged to Tim Nolinger, a struggling American journalist who is hot on the trail of a breaking story: the theft of a valuable illuminated manuscript from a private collection in New York. Rumor has it that the manuscript may be in the hands of Serge Cray, a reclusive film director living on the outskirts of Paris. As Tim, Anne-Sophie, a pair of American antique dealers, and one amorous member of the local gentry converge on the Cray home - a chateau rumored to have once belonged to Madame du Barry - Clara Holly, Cray's Oregon-born wife and a former actress, is propelled into a Kafkaesque nightmare: She stands accused of desecrating a national monument. Add to that a disappearing American; a hunting contretemps; a wrongful arrest; murder; and various suspicions, seductions, domestic crises, and declarations of love that send both hosts and houseguests into erotic tailspins.",

Saddam Hussein is stockpiling an arsenal of terror. Someone is covertly selling him the chemicals needed to make deadly biological weapons. Veteran TV correspondent Peter Dees--hard-living, wisecracking, eager for a break--seizes the story. But his sources, many of them his friends, are dying one by one, shot in the head execution-style.Determined to uncover the truth behind these slayings, Dees himself becomes a target in an insidious emerging plot. From Port-au-Prince and Cairo to the scorched deserts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, Dees finds the conspiracy much deeper than he ever imagined as he discovers a shocking secret hidden inside a murdered producer's computer file. Then, along with the sassy, canny, and beautiful TV producer Melinda Adams, Dees's search for answers propels him into the very heart of a death-charred war zone.Yet as Dees scrambles to piece together a story that could rock the world, he senses powerful forces closing in on him. For it seems that everyone--even the U.S. government--masks deep, damning secrets. And the closer Dees gets to the truth, the likelier it becomes that he will never get out of the country alive.In his riveting novel of suspense, laced through with biting humor and a breakneck pace, Jaco captures the spirit of the men and women who report--and sometimes shape--the major events of the world in a novel you will never forget.",

        "Title": "Circle William: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Harlow, Bill",
        "Description": "Two brothers -- one a presidential press secretary, the other a maverick captain on a Navy destroyer -- scramble to prevent a Libyan plot to use chemical weapons against Israel and the United States.  Jim Schmidt is a master of spin. As White House press secretary, his job is to cajole, sweet-talk, and otherwise persuade the nation's most powerful journalists to play a story the way the White House wants it played. Jim's younger brother, Bill, is equally skillful, but in a different realm. He's the charismatic captain of the USS Winston Churchill, and he leads an able but rambunctious crew with a penchant for causing well-publicized \"liberty incidents\" around the Mediterranean.  Both men instinctively understand their jobs, but more important, they understand power and how it works: He who controls the facts controls the response. So when the United States learns of a Libyan plot to drop a planeload of chemical weapons on the Israeli Knesset, the brothers -- thousands of miles apart -- unexpectedly find themselves working together to defuse the plan. Their first step is to set \"Circle William,\" a Navy phrase meaning to prepare for chemical, germ, or nuclear attack.  As Jim huddles with the country's top defense and intelligence officials to plot a viable strategy to prevent the strike, Bill, on the front lines of the crisis, prepares to implement the plan. Complicating their mission is the inconvenient presence of Sue O'Dell, a smart Washington Post Style reporter who wants to write a feature on the commander and his notorious ship.  How the brothers counter the Libyan threat and how they spin the story make Circle William as much a story of international terrorism as a contemporary political thriller.  Drawing from more than two decades of service in the U.S. Navy, his work inside the Pentagon, and from his tenure as an assistant White House press secretary, Bill Harlow combines the insider's detail of Primary Colors with the technical expertise of The Hunt for Red October. Circle William, as authentic and chilling as any news event, is an impressive debut by a writer with an intimate knowledge of the workings of Washington, the military, and international terrorism.",

        "Title": "Talking from 9 to 5: How Women's and Men's Conversational Styles Affect Who Gets Heard, Who Gets Credit, and What Gets Done at Work",
        "Authors": "By Tannen, Deborah",
        "Description": "You say something at a meeting, it is ignored, then someone else says the same thing and everyone embraces it as a marvelous idea. You devote yourself to a project, but don't get credit for the results. You work around the clock to avoid a crisis, but your efforts are not recognized because no one notices a crisis that never occurs. You give what you think are clear instructions, but the job is not done, or is done wrong. Sometimes it seems you are not getting heard, not getting credit for your efforts, not getting ahead as fast as you should.Many of us spend more of our lives at work than we do at home, yet while we choose our life-partners and friends, at work we are thrown together with people we did not choose, some of whom we don't understand and may not even like.In Talking from 9 to 5, Deborah Tannen brings to the workplace the same compelling voice, keen eye, and deep insight that made That's Not What I Meant! and You Just Don't Understand best-selling classics. Here, she offers powerful new ways of understanding what happens in the workplace, ranging from the simplest exchanges to the complex contemporary issues of the glass ceiling and sexual harassment.Work is a special world because as we talk to get our jobs done, we are also being evaluated. How we get others to do what we want, and how we accept or avoid responsibility for mistakes, display or challenge authority, reveal or conceal what we don't know - all affect how we are regarded and rewarded.Individuals in positions of authority are judged by how they enact that authority. This poses a particular challenge for women, since the ways that women are expected to talk are at odds with our usual images of authority. Women at work often have ways of creating authority that can be misinterpreted as a lack of confidence or even competence.Tannen maintains that no one style of speaking is superior. She does not tell women to speak like men or men to speak like women. Instead, she explains a variety of styles with real-life examples and urges everyone to be aware of and to learn from other conversational styles and to develop flexibility.Talking from 9 to 5 will have a dramatic impact on those who are struggling with co-workers, jobs, and companies - and will help individuals as well as companies thrive in a working world made up of increasingly diverse work forces and ever more competitive markets.",

        "Authors": "By Clements, Marcelle",
        "Description": "Finally the real lives of the more than 40 million single American women are captured--and celebrated--in a work of wit, scope, and exceptional empathy. Over the past seven years journalist and essayist Marcelle Clements asked over one hundred women--young and old, never married, divorced, and widowed, the childless and single mothers--to talk to her about being single. How did they get there? Were they sorry or glad? What is the texture of their experience? They spoke with stunning frankness and eloquence on subjects such as power, status, money, class, family, sense of home, romance, love, sex, fears of old age and death, and the future of gender. The Improvised Woman is the groundbreaking result: a powerful portrait, in their own words and in the probing essay/introduction by Marcelle Clements, of women whose ever-changing lives defy easy categorization even as they shatter the crude stereotypes of the past. The change in the status and psyche of single women from Cosmo icon to powerful sociocultural player is perhaps the most significant trend of our time. Moving, funny, immensely readable, The Improvised Woman is the first book to take the measure of this development, and women everywhere are certain to say \"It's about time.\"",

When their mother dies in childbirth, Moira and Julia O'Leary are left to rear their infant sister, Ann, while their father, a sheep farmer, despairs. After Ann dies, Moira and Julia depart Cork for Boston, but the painful secret behind Ann's death haunts their new lives and presages the confusion that will come to trouble the next generation.

Moira's Crossing charts their shared journey through marriage, children, and life on the coast of Maine.

But sometimes the rules do not apply. When Sydney's friend, the father of her godchild, NYPD Captain John Cannady, is found shot and critically wounded outside of his own apartment door, the rule book goes out the window. Eager to help Cannady's distraught wife, Peggy, an old friend of Sydney's from their college days, Sloane tries to pitch in any way she can.With no real clues to go on, the police assume that the shooting was either completely random or the work of a criminal from Cannady's past looking for revenge. But those theories get scrapped when Peggy receives a threatening call from a man claiming to be someone from her own past - the now-adult child she gave up for adoption after an unfortunate teen pregnancy. His desire for revenge is terrifying, even more so when he raises the stakes and targets her young daughter Lucy.With only the thinnest of leads, Sydney must somehow find a man about whom they know almost nothing, and who has had a lifetime to cover what few tracks he might have left on any official records. With one friend fighting for his life in the hospital, another paralyzed by guilt and fear, and her godchild at risk, Sydney's skills are put to their ultimate test.",

Mining is fraught with danger. Fortunately, the camp has a watch-wher, a creature distantly related to dragons and uniquely suited to specialized work in the dark, cold mineshafts. Kindan's father is the watch-wher's handler, and his son sometimes helps him out. But even that important job promises no opportunity outside the mine.Then disaster strikes. In one terrible instant, Kindan loses his family and the camp loses its watch-wher. Fathers are replaced by sons in the mine - except for Kindan, who is taken in by the camp's new Harper. Grieving, Kindan finds a measure of solace in a burgeoning musical talent ... and in a new friendship with Nuella, a mysterious girl no one seems to know exists. It is Nuella who assists Kindan when he is selected to hatch and train a new watch-wher, a job that forces him to give up his dream of becoming a Harper; and it is Nuella who helps him give new meaning to his life.Meanwhile, sparked by the tragedy, long-simmering tensions are dividing the camp. Far below the surface, a group of resentful miners hides a deadly secret. As warring factions threaten to explode, Nuella and Kindan begin to discover unknown talents in the misunderstood watch-wher - talents that could very well save an entire Hold. During their time teaching the watch-wher, the two learn some things themselves: that even a seemingly impossible dream is never completely out of reach ... and that light can be found even in the deepest darkness.",

His father, Kevin, teaches history with a decidedly socialist tinge at the Chicago private school Henry and his sister attend. His mother, Beth, who plays the piano in a group specializing in antique music, is a loving, attentive wife and parent. Henry even accepts the offbeat behavior of his thirteen-year-old sister, Elvira, who is obsessed with Civil War reenactments and insists on dressing in handmade Union uniforms at inopportune times.When he stumbles on his mother's e-mail account, however, Henry realizes that all is not as it seems. There, under the name Liza38, a name that Henry innocently established for her, is undeniable evidence that his mother is having an affair with one Richard Polloco, a violin maker and unlikely paramour who nonetheless has a very appealing way with words and a romantic spirit that, in Henry's estimation, his own father woefully lacks.Against his better judgment, Henry charts the progress of his mother's infatuation, her feelings of euphoria, of guilt, and of profound, touching confusion. His knowledge of Beth's secret life colors his own tentative explorations of love and sex with the ephemeral Lily, and casts a new light on the arguments - usually focused on Elvira - in which his parents regularly indulge. Over the course of his final year of high school, Henry observes each member of the family, trying to anticipate when they will find out about the infidelity and what the knowledge will mean to each of them.Henry's observations, set down ten years after that fateful year, are much more than the \"old story\" of adultery his mother deemed her affair to be.",

But when a team of moonlighting medical students accidentally takes skin from the wrong donor, the results are catastrophic:  a New York City hospital ward is destroyed in a psychotic bloodbath, and an elderly professor, admitted for a routine skin graft, is suddenly the city's most wanted fugitive.  Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are the only ones to suspect something more ominous than a medical procedure gone awry.  As the FBI agents investigating the \"X-Files\"--strange and inexplicable cases the Bureau wants to keep hidden, Mulder and Scully are determined to track down the forces they suspect are behind the murderer.  While the police hunt the fleeing professor, Mulder and Scully track the skin that was mistakenly grafted onto him.  The trail leads from the morgue to the headquarters of a cutting-edge biotech company.  Soon Mulder and Scully are in Thailand, searching the jungles for an abandoned MASH Unit, where napalm victims were treated with an amazing recovery rate--even though none of the hundreds of men who were nursed back to health ever returned to their families.  Scully is looking for an experimental medical technology with disastrous side effects.  Mulder suspects the stakes are even higher, a fear gruesomely confirmed as they begin to uncover an unholy and totally deniable alliance between a battle-trained plastic surgeon, international politicians, and a legendary Thai monster known as the \"Skin-Eater.\"",

        "Title": "My Spy: Memoir of a Cia Wife",
        "Authors": "By Kiyonaga, Bina Cady",
        "Description": "Our story spans fifty years, four continents, three wars, a revolution, five children, two races and one faith. It is the story of an often stormy, sometimes blissful, but never dull marriage. It lasted thirty years - and then death did the parting.So begins the love story of Joe Kiyonaga, the striking Japanese-American war hero from Hawaii, and Bina Cady, the irreverent Irish-Catholic redhead from Baltimore. Similar in their convictions, different in most every other respect, the two leaped into a marriage in 1947 that defied the anti-Japanese sentiments of the day. Their unlikely union would come to include a powerful, top-secret cohort: the CIA.During the darkest days of the Cold War, Bina, as a CIA wife, was initiated into a world of silence. She would learn not to ask who had called at 2:00 A.M., where Joe had disappeared to for days at a time, or why a notorious dictator had shown up at their door unannounced. Joe's \"cover' had to be maintained, and no one could be trusted with the truth. Bina would learn to live a lie and lie bravely.From the surreal intrigue of post-war Japan to the raucous mariachi-band parties of 1960s El Salvador and the \"Yankee Go Home\" Panama of the 1970s to the planning of a coup d'etat in Brazil, Bina would become Joe's unwitting partner, playing the traditional role of wife and mother for the most untraditional of ends: helping Joe recruit agents. Everything from cocktail parties to the children's swim meets would become possible venues for agent recruitment, every casual acquaintance-even the parish priest-a potential intelligence source. Through Joe's work, Bina was introduced to foreign leaders, military strongmen and influential journalists secretly working with Washington-a cast of like-minded souls who believed, as did Joe and Bina, that the CIA's cause was noble and that its methods served a greater good.In the end, Bina's story is the story of the spy she loved. Born out in the cold, on an island where being too tall and too western-looking made him a rumor incarnate, Joe Kiyonaga was all the more remarkable for what he became, and overcame. A man with a foothold in many worlds, but at home in none, he was ready to kick over the traces and re-invent himself as the consummate spy.Only after thirty years, as Joe lay dying, did Bina finally meet the husband she never knew, and hear the full details of the secret life and global cause of which she and their five children had been a part.This is the story that Joe entrusted to Bina, a story she promised him she would tell. A story of a time to remember, and of a marriage forged by trust and faith in a world full of lies.Our story spans fifty years, four continents, three wars, a revolution, five children, two races and one faith.

He yearns to write long philosophical pieces about the American dream gone sour, not the flaccid write-ups of bake-off contests demanded by the Truth. Then, old man Lawton goes missing, and suspicion fixes on his son, Ronny. Paradoxically, the specter of violent death breathes new life into the town. For Bill, a deeper and more disturbing involvement with the Lawtons ensues. The Lawton murder and the obsessions it awakes in the town come to symbolize the mood of a nation on the edge. Compulsively readable, The Keepers of Truth startles both with its insights and with Collins's powerful, incisive writing.",

Bush - the eldest son of former president George Herbert Walker Bush - would be heir apparent to the Republican presidential nomination, if not to the presidency itself.In this first book by journalist Elizabeth Mitchell, the author makes the case that George W. learned well from watching his father, that from the beginning he had personal characteristics - including an easy and convivial way with people - that his father did not have in the same measure, and that, perhaps most importantly, in George W.'s quest to become president, he is fueled not only by his own ambition and grooming, but also by his desire to avenge his father's painful loss to Bill Clinton in 1992.In the tradition of political journalists like David Maraniss and Richard Ben Cramer, Elizabeth Mitchell looks at the whole person in the context of his life and family tradition, in order to answer the questions: What makes George W. run? And should he win, what kind of president will he be?",

Despite this massive and uniquely devoted following, until now there has been no comprehensive, one-stop source for the stories and information these fans demand - The Phishing Manual satisfies that demand and more. The Manual begins with a lively account of Phish's origins and history, starting with the band's initial meeting at the University of Vermont in 1983 and continuing through to 1996 as their concert sales reach an all-time high. Other chapters contain insights and trivia about Phish compositions - from \"AC/DC Bag\" \"You Enjoy Myself\" - as well as information about the band's favorite covers - from \"All along the Watchtower\" to \"Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey.\" The Manual successfully recreates the unique Phish concert experience - explaining the phenomenon known as \"Macaroni and Cheese Dinner\" - as well as providing extensive tape concert recommendations and a fantastic library of set lists. For the die-hard Phish-head or the new initiate, for the veteran tape trader or the casual concert-goer, The Phishing Manual is the perfect companion to the Phish experience.",

According to Tim LaHaye and David Noebel, life is mainly about the battle for your mind: whether you will live by man's wisdom, from the likes of Marx, Darwin, Freud, and Nietzsche, or God's wisdom and those who gave it, such as Moses, the prophets, Christ, and the apostles.
