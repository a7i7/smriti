Drawing on his exclusive access to the key players at the White House and Downing Street, Con Coughlin explains what led Blair to risk his political career for a cause that he truly believed in. Just as Bob Woodward called on insiders to analyze George W. Bush in Bush at War, Coughlin now calls on his own experience and sources to offer a critical analysis and account of Tony Blair at war.Here is an in-depth, probing look at the man who has become America&#39;s first ally in the post-9/11 world. Tony Blair&#39;s staunch support for the United States since 9/11 has confirmed his position as one of the most important and controversial world leaders of the twenty-first century. In the aftermath of terrorist attacks in London and with Iraq in turmoil, the relationship between Britain and the United States will be critical in determining how future international crises are resolved. American Ally is an essential read for those wishing to make an informed opinion.",

Not only is a renegade member of the Peruvian military seeking to make sure his candidate wins, but he is prepared to go to great lengths to make sure that happens. Realizing that military coup is likely to backfire, the general wants to tilt public sentiment in favor of his candidate, who is recognized by the public as being closely tied to the army. He has purchased a tactical nuclear bomb and by making it seem the nuke has fallen into the hands of guerillas-and then staging an operation to confiscate it-he hopes to turn the election.When the general and his plot are exposed, the NSA concludes the greatest threat is over. But in fact, it's just beginning. Dean's partner, ex-Delta Force trooper Lia DeFrancesca, is kidnapped and held hostage in a mountain hideaway. The general vanishes.

        "Description": "A broken kitchen appliance leads Bobbie Kaplowitz -- a single mother of a six-year-old son -- to a new understanding of love and life in the title story of In Case We're Separated, Alice Mattison's family chronicle of interrelated stories.Spanning the twentieth century, In Case We're Separated looks at a family of Jewish immigrants in the 1920s and 1930s, and follows their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren as they all lead urban, emotionally turbulent lives against the backdrop of political assassinations, the Vietnam War, and the AIDS epidemic.The title story, which appeared in Best American Short Stories 2002, begins with Bobbie in 1954 Brooklyn. Subsequent stories deal with Bobbie's son, Bradley, a gay man living outside Boston with his partner and playing detective after a cousin's girlfriend is assaulted at knifepoint.Other stories concern two sisters: one is an editor, always trying to figure out just how Jewish she is, always trying to get through to her troubled sister. The sister, a would-be suicide during the 1960s and 1970s, reappears as a shaky Prozac miracle, helping others and scrambling to hold on to happiness in her middle-aged life. The sisters keep looking for the right man, and the next-to-the-last story includes a midlife wedding and the gathering of what remains of this varied clan.The sisters' aunt Sylvia appears and reappears throughout the book. She's a schoolteacher who always knows what's best for everyone; later, she's a middle-aged woman still trying to hold on to hope -- and looking for her \"next affair\" -- despite an aging mother, an unhappy son, and the election of Ronald Reagan. Later still, with failing eyesight, she hangs on to dignity in her own old age, not wanting to ask her busy, professional daughter whether her shoes match.Alice Mattison's recent novel The Wedding of the Two-Headed Woman was called \"quietly splendid\" by the New York Times. The Los Angeles Times has called her \"a writer's writer.\" In In Case We're Separated, Mattison's gift for storytelling and ability to create rich, multidimentional characters prove, once again, that she is a master of her craft.",

        "Description": "The WARREN BUFFETT WA Peter Lynch, bestselling author of One Up on Wall Street, says he's \"the Greatest Investor of them all. What is the secret of Warren Buffett's spectacular success How has he managed to so consistently beat all the major indices and so regularly come up a market winner? Is his track record really nothing more than a rare statistical aberration\u2014or is it the result of an identifiable approach that other investors can learn and master? The Warren Buffett Way offers investors their first in-depth look at the innovative investment and business strategies behind the spectacular success of living legend Warren E. Buffett. Tracing Warren Buffett's career from the beginning, Robert G. Hagstrom, Jr., tells us exactly how, starting with an initial investment of only $100, Buffett built a business empire worth $19.4 billion A folksy midwesterner given to terse, homespun wisdom, Warren E. Buffett is one of the most closely watched figures in business today. A savvy investor and brilliant stock-picker, Buffett disdains market trends and sees himself as an investor in businesses rather than stocks \"Warren Buffett is often characterized simply as a 'value investor' or a 'Ben Graham disciple.' Hagstrom fills in the rest of the story with some immensely practical pointers on prospering in the market.\" \u2014Martin S. Fridson Managing Director Merrill Lync \"Warren Buffett is surely the Greatest Investor of this century\u2014not so much because he built a great fortune within a free market as because he has shared his important thinking with us and has openly demonstrated the sagacity and courage so vital to success. Berkshire Hathaway has been my largest, longest investment. Warren has been my best teacher.\" \u2014Charles D. Ellis Managing Partner Greenwich Associate The Warren Buffett Way is both a fascinating read and a valuable resource for investors and business leaders Business Week called him \"The Most Famous Investor. Forbes dubbed him \"The richest person in America and an investment genius on a scale that the world rarely sees. \"The Warren Buffett Way outlines his career and presents examples of how his investment techniques and methods evolved and the important individuals in that process. It also details the key investment decisions that produced his unmatched record of performance. Finally the book contains the thinking and the philosophy of an investor that consistently made money using the tools available to every citizen no matter their level of wealth.\" \u2014from the Foreword by Peter S. Lynch Bestselling author, One Up on Wall Street and Beating the Stree \"Robert Hagstrom presents an in-depth examination of Warren Buffett's strategies, and the 'how and why' behind his selection of each of the major equity securities that have contributed to his remarkable record of success. His 'homespun' wisdom and philosophy are also part of this comprehensive, interesting, and readable book.\" \u2014John C. Bogle Chairman, The Vanguard Grou \"In simple language this book tells the rules by which the most successful American stock investor of modern time got that way. It could be a godsend to the legion of unhappy investors who keep floundering because they ignore the basics of major investment success.\"\u2014Phil Fisher Author of Common Stocks and Uncommon Profit \"Fans of Warren Buffett (count me in) have been waiting anxiously for the great man to write a book and tell us how he does it. Now we can all relax and read this one. It's first rate. Buffett gets a lot of attention for what he preaches, but nobody has described what he practices better than Hagstrom. Here is the lowdown on every major stock he ever bought and why he bought it. Fascinating. You could even try this at home.\" \u2014John Rothchild Financial columnist Time magazin",

There is nothing left for him to do but say good-bye to the wife and child he loves, get his mind right with the God in whom he believes - and give one last statement to the public: an interview with a reporter for the St. Louis News.Steve Everett is the reporter. Despised by his colleagues and unfaithful to his wife, he's looking for a big story to get his life and career back on track. The last thing he needs is to waste his time on a human-interest feature about a convicted killer's last testament. But Everett is good at what he does, and when the Beachum interview is dropped in his lap, he begins to uncover another story - a more frightening story - just below the surface.As Frank Beachum's time dwindles to nothing, Everett begins to believe that the man may be a wholly guiltless victim of rough justice, political blindness and human error. He believes the state may be about to murder an innocent.There are eighteen hours until midnight. In those hours Frank Beachum is going to be pushed to the very limits of his faith, looking over the edge into a nightmare. And Steve Everett, in spite of himself, is going to risk everything, even his own life, in a breathless attempt to save him.",

The author looks beyond the myth enshrouding one of the absolute masterpieces of Leonardo's genius, and gives us Mona Lisa as an authentic and living woman. With his engaging and casual style, he has reconstructed her personal and historical dimension. The revelation of the mysterious identity of the model, hidden up until now and object of the most disparate and far-fetched hypotheses, certainly takes nothing away from the enigmatic quality of that \"smile\". It becomes even more fascinating to us after we have been immersed in the world of her affections and read her husband's will, palpably imbued with a genuine love for his \"cherished wife\". The beauty of her spirit now seems even more radiant than the external beauty eternalized by Leonardo.",

        "Authors": "By Joachim, David, Newman, Bettina, and Revsin, Leslie",
        "Description": "From Atkins to The Zone, low-carbohydrate diets have taken the country by storm. But despite their popularity, they have a downside. Many require that you give up virtually all carbohydrates-- not only favorites like bread and pasta, but healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Such low-carb diets are nutritionally unsound, alarmingly low in calories and nutrients, and dangerously high in heart-harming fat. But breakthrough research into how and why low-carb diets work convinced Bettina Newman, R.D., that limiting the intake of carbohydrates can lead to safe, healthy weight loss-- if it's done right. Teaming up with Prevention magazine, America's premier health magazine, Bettina developed this moderate, nutritionally sound low-carb approach to weight loss. Packed with delicious recipes, this book doesn't ask you to eliminate carbohydrates completely. Nor does it foolishly recommend feasting on pork rinds and butter, as some low-carb diets do. What it does is to offer up a simple, seven-step plan for shedding excess pounds the smart, healthy low-carb way-- along with 200 flavorful low-carb recipes for snacks, sandwiches, easy one-dish dinners, even desserts! In short, there's a low-carbohydrate eating plan that works in the real world. It allows you many of your favorite foods, like pasta, grains, and potatoes. It contains adequate calories, so you don't experience hunger pangs or miss out on important nutrients. And it isn't dangerously high in fat, so you won't increase your risk of developing heart disease. Nor will you miss out on taste. One look at the recipes-- Chocolate Hazelnut Flourless Cake, Whole Grain Pancakes with Berry Cream Syrup, Pesto Chicken Sandwich with Roasted Peppers-- will convince you of that. And you'll love the inspiring, real-life stories of people who lost weight the smart low-carb way and have kept it off for as long as 15 years! You'll also find: * Six weight-loss plans for every need-- choose the calorie and carb levels that are right for you * Insider tips on mastering a low-carb diet * A \"cheat sheet\" for stocking the smart low-carb kitchen * How to conquer the dreaded weight-loss plateau * The Smart Low-Carb Food Pyramid * Time-savers and flavor-boosting tips with recipes * Smart low-carb food substitutions * Seven days of slimming menus",

She inspires us all to find a way to translate our spiritual beliefs into action in the world. How has one woman accomplished so much? And what are the guiding principles that have enabled this humble nun to so profoundly effect the lives of millions?Now, in her own words, Mother Teresa shares the thoughts and experiences that have led her to do her extraordinary charitable work. A candid look at her everyday life--at the very simplicity and self-sacrifice that give her the strength to move mountains--A Simple Path gives voice to the remarkable spirit who has dedicated her life to the poorest among us.Just as important as her beliefs are how they are put into action in the world, and A Simple Path also tells the story of the founding of the Missionaries of Charity, their purpose and practice, and the results of their tireless work. Through faith, surrender, and prayer, the missionaries live to serve others; they have improved the lives of countless souls and given dignity to the dying. Their mission has also produced a ripple effect, spreading human compassion to communities where there is need.Through these examples, as well as the uplifting words and guiding prayers of Mother Teresa and those who work with her, everyone can learn how to walk the simple path that Mother Teresa has laid out for us, to help create a truly kinder world for the future.A Simple Path is a unique spiritual guide for Catholics and non-Catholics alike: full of wisdom and hope from the one person who has given us the greatest model of love in action in our time.",

        "Description": "At last, the true and complete story of Marilyn Monroe's final days can be told.This riveting, headline-making, myth-shattering book, based on thousands of newly discovered documents, hours of newly available footage from her final film, and over 300 revealing new interviews, is a detailed and astonishing account of what really happened during the last fourteen weeks in the life of Hollywood's legendary sex goddess. Recreating the drama of a bygone era of glamour and intrigue, it presents compelling evidence that Marilyn Monroe was the victim of two conspiracies that, together, brought about her professional and personal downfall: an elaborate scheme on the part of a once-mighty film studio teetering on the brink of bankruptcy; and an even more sinister plot masterminded by America's First Family. Among the shattering, totally authenticated revelations: the searing details of Marilyn's affairs with John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, including her famous birthday song to JFK and her final series of rendezvous with RFK; how Marilyn was sabotaged by executives of 20th Century-Fox and psychologically shredded on the set by a predatory pack led by vengeful director George Cukor; how the cruel competition between Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor sealed Marilyn's fate with the studio bosses; the role the FBI, CIA, and Secret Service played in blanketing the scene of her death and in the disposal of her private papers and personal effects; and why the accidental overdose theory cannot stand.Just as affecting as these and other eyeopening new facts is the way that Marilyn herself comes to life again. Marilyn, confidently in love, not hesitating to phone her powerful lover when he was with his wife. Marilyn, the ultimate professional, an actress at the peak of her talent and beauty. Marilyn without makeup, fresh and funny and unspoiled. Marilyn, tormented by her past and her private demons, seeking escape in alcohol and pills, and release in her art. Complete with 16 pages of stunning photos, many never seen before, this is an unforgettable portrait of Marilyn Monroe as she deserves to be remembered - the way she really was.",

        "Authors": "By Bing, Stanley",
        "Description": "A hilarious and tough-minded guide to winning the war of contemporary life. We live in a vicious, highly competitive workplace environment, and things aren\u2032t getting any better. Jobs are few and far between, and people aren\u2032t any nicer now than they were when Ghengis Khan ran around in big furs killing people in unfriendly acquisitions. For thousands of years, people have been reading the writings of the deeply wise, but also extremely dead Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu, who was perhaps the first to look on the waging of war as a strategic art that could be taught to people who wished to be warlords and other kinds of senior managers.  In a nutshell, Sun Tzu taught that readiness is all, that knowledge of oneself and the enemy was the foundation of strength and that those who fight best are those who are prepared and wise enough not to fight at all. Unfortunately, in the current day, this approach is pretty much horse hockey, a fact that has not been recognized by the bloated, tree-hugging Sun Tzu industry, which churns out mushy-gushy pseudo-philosophy for business school types who want to make war and keep their hands clean.  Sun Tzu was a Sissy will transcend all those efforts and teach the reader how to make war, win and enjoy the plunder in the real world, where those who do not kick, gouge and grab are left behind at the table to pay the tab. Students of Bing will be taught how to plan and execute battles that hurt other people a lot, and advance their flags and those of their friends, if possible. All military strategies will be explored, from mustering, equipping, organizing, plotting, scheming, rampaging, squashing and reaping spoils.  Every other book on The Art of War bows low to Sun Tzu. We\u2032re going to tell him to get lost and inform our readers how real war is currently conducted on the battlefield of life.",

That war persists today, as the wizard Mauryl's Shaping confronts the Shadows that Hasufin summoned from Chaos against the Siddhe lords.Tristen is that Shaping, a halfling creature of Fire and Shadow.  Both more and less than human, he turned back sorcery's tides in the legend-heavy battle of Lewenbrook.  Tristen's victory brought his friend Cefwyn the burden of a Kingdom, Ylesuin, and the light of a love that would outlast the ages--Ninevrise, with her gift of prophecy.But the Lines that hold the world in place are shifting once again.  The lightning-sheeted sky is aflame with sorcery's terror and magic's promise.  Tasmorden has raised an army of rebels, and planted betrayers in Cefwyn's Dragon Guard.  Once again, Cefwyn's peril is Tristen's call to arms.Astride black-maned Dys, with the eyes of Owl and the counsel of Auld Syes, with the friendship of Crissand and the loyalty of Uwen, Tristen takes up his sword inscribed with \"Truth\" and \"Illusion\" back-to-back on its blade. But the day will not be won by iron edges. Even Tristen's double-edged sword cannot cut through the knot of this new challenge. For Tristen is facing more than a pretender to Cefwyn's throne. The Shadows he sees are not from the overwhelmed sun, but straight from Ruin--a flow of darkness covering the world like ink.If sorcery is wizardry gone askew, what is magic's dark side? A wind, as nameless as the abyss from which it rises and as cold as the knowledge of Tristen's true origin....Fortress of Dragons completes the soaring tale of two friends, sovereign and sorcerer, begun in Fortress in the Eye of Time and continued in Fortress of Eagles and Fortress of Owls. This awesome high fantasy epic from the acclaimed, awardwinning author is set in a world tangled with magic, dark with violence, and filled with wonder and awe--a world as vividly real as our own.",

With virtually unlimited access to Farleigh's wallet, pool, and imported cars, he couldn't possibly be better situated. Until Farleigh, after weeks of remaining conspicuously cold and aloof, drops the big one, the unthinkable, the horror of horrors: Dennis must get a job.Dennis believes there can be only one explanation for this outrage: he's let himself go. And as any kept boy worth his gym membership knows, a spare tire can run right over a relationship. Alas, even after a crash course in iron pumping with an albino Amazon, his situation only worsens. First, he discovers that he's unemployable virtually anywhere on the planet. Then he learns that his old career is in jeopardy as well, for Farleigh's affections have been snared by the lithe young pool boy Jasper Batton. When Jasper is promoted from chlorination duties to directing Farleigh's production of Lady Windermere's Fan, Dennis panics; he's in danger of losing not only his position as Farleigh's house hunk, but also his place in Farleigh's last will and testament.Desperate for a way up from this devastating downfall, Dennis turns to his best friends: Lonnie Roach, the kept man of ancient gossip columnist Dierdre Diamon, and Paulette Ng, the kept woman of a member of Congress whose anonymity she protects by referring to him only as \"the Spanker of the House.\" Together, the three devise a cunning plan to whisk Farleigh away to the romantic Greek Isles, where Dennis hopes to re-seduce him.But the warm Hellenic breeze stirs up more trouble than magic, and Dennis, with only a pair of Iowa coeds for allies, must wage one final, desperate campaign to keep Farleigh's love, battling everything from stampeding goats to a deranged Santorini grandmother.",

That a perfect solution for those easy-to-lose TV remotes is to duct tape them to your arm? (Not only won't you lose it, you'll never have to relinquish control over it, either!) But can you also believe that Jim and Tim's creative ideas for duct tape spawned not just one bestselling book, but three, plus a calendar? And now the ultimate collection?  With two-thirds of the material drawn from their previous books and calendars and one-third all-new, The Jumbo Duct Tape Book is pure nuttiness to the nth degree. The premise is right there, on page one: \"One rule can get you through life. It if ain't stuck and it's supposed to be, duct tape it.\" But of course it's the interpretation that counts-like duct taping the gas pedal for cruise control, or duct taping marbles to your pressure points for instant reflexology. And then there's bending the rule-transforming sneakers into golf shoes by punching nails through duct tape and taping it to the soles, saving energy by taping all switches in the off position. Plus cosmetic dentistry (use white tape for the \"The Mask\" look, silver for the metal-mouth bad guy look), cell phone safety (tape phone to side of head while driving so hands stay on wheel), home decorating (use duct tape for easy drapery tie-backs). You can even convert the book to a \"hard cover\" by taping a piece of 1/4 inch sheet of plate steel to the front and back covers. It'll last for years!",

Now we finally learn what happened to Pei, as she leaves the silk house for Hong Kong in the 1930s, arriving with a young orphan, Ji Shen, in her care. Her first job, in the home of a wealthy family, ends in disgrace, but soon Pei and Ji Shen find a new life in the home of Mrs. Finch, a British ex-patriate who welcomes them as the daughters she never had.  Their idyllic life is interrupted, however, by war, and the Japanese occupation. Pei is once again forced to make her own way, struggling to survive and to keep her extended family alive as well.

Hermanisms offers readers an assortment of straightforward advice, blunt commentary, and engaging stories based on Herman\u2019s more than 35 years of surviving the real world of business \u2014 and especially surviving failure. While the book discusses the likelihood of failure when you\u2019re an entrepreneur, it\u2019s not intended to discourage you from starting a new venture. Instead, it is intended to make you realize issues you may want to ignore, but shouldn\u2019t. And it has another goal: to make you understand that playing the game gives you more than just money. There are other \u201cprofits\u201d to be derived from being your own boss. While your company may not make you rich, or last a lifetime, it will definitely enhance your being\u2014if you choose to let it. With short, easy-to-read chapters for each of the 77 sayings that Herman lovingly refers to as \u201cHermanisms,\u201d this is a great book to have nearby. Use the few free minutes in your day to hear from someone who\u2019s been there \u2014 and perhaps learn something that may helpful.",

As Bethany approaches her thirteenth birthday, her parents act more oddly than usual. Her mother cries constantly, and her father barely lets Bethany out of his sight. Then one morning he hustles the entire family into the car, drives across several state lines -- and leaves Bethany with an aunt she never knew existed. Bethany has no idea what's going on. She's worried her mom and dad are running from some kind of trouble, but she can't find out because they won't tell her where they are going.   Bethany's only clue is a few words she overheard her father tell her aunt: \"She doesn't know anything about Elizabeth.\" But Aunt Myrlie won't tell Bethany who Elizabeth is, and she won't explain why people in her small town react to Bethany as if they've seen a ghost. The mystery intensifies when Bethany gets a package from her father containing four different birth certificates from four different states, with four different last names -- and thousands of dollars in cash. And when a strange man shows up asking questions, Bethany realizes the's not the only one who's desperate to unravel the secrets of her past.",
