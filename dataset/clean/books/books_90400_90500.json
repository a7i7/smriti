        "Authors": "By Bissex, Janice Newell and Weiss, Liz",
        "Description": "For the legions of harried moms who have tossed in the dishtowel on cooking healthy meals (or any meals!), the easiest-ever guide for bringing super nutrition back to the kitchen. Getting dinner on the table night after night can be a challenge.  So it\u2019s no surprise that busy moms often rely on fast food, takeout, and convenience meals like macaroni & cheese, chicken nuggets, and fries.  The kids love it but the drawback is that little twinge of guilt moms feel every time they feed their family another not-so-healthy meal.  At the end of the day, many children end up with a poor diet high in sugar, saturated fat, and calories \u2026 a major factor in the rising rates of obesity.Finally, here are realistic guidelines designed to give families a healthy meal makeover. The Moms lay out a 5-Step Meal Makeover Plan, explaining how to market good nutrition to kids, establish food rules, and make life easier in the kitchen.  In The Best of the Bunch chapter they reveal which brands of kid convenience foods\u2013hot dogs, frozen pizza, and more\u2013are the best tasting and most nutritious ones out there.  The Moms show how to stock a healthy pantry and whip up delicious anytime meals using pantry staples. They even serve up 120 reworked recipes for family favorites such as Fast-as-Boxed Macaroni & Cheese, Squishy Squash Lasagna, Cheesy Broccoli Soup, Sweet Potato Fries, and Chocolate Pudding with Toppers.",

        "Title": "Making War to Keep Peace",
        "Authors": "By Kirkpatrick, Jeane J",
        "Description": "When Jeane J. Kirkpatrick died in December 2006, she left behind more than her legacy as a \"heroine of conservatives.\" She had just completed work on this extraordinary survey of American foreign policy in the post\u2013Cold War age: a bold and revisionist assessment of two decades of American interventions abroad\u2014a troubled period of small successes, tragic failures, and important lessons for our future.Since the end of the Cold War, Kirkpatrick argues, America's relationship with the world has been especially compromised by its mutual distrust with the United Nations, and by continuing uncertainty over U.S. involvement in conflicts among rogue nations overseas. In Making War to Keep Peace, Kirkpatrick offers a tightly observed chronicle of the result: a period in which the United States has increasingly used force around the world\u2014to mixed and often challenging results. Tracing the course of diplomatic initiatives and armed conflict in Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo, she illuminates the shift from the first Bush administration's ambitious vision of a New World Order to the overambitious nation-building efforts of the Clinton administration. Kirkpatrick offers a strong critique of Clinton's foreign policy, arguing that his administration went beyond Bush's interest in building international consensus and turned it into a risky reliance on the United Nations. But she also questions when, how, and why the United States should resort to military solutions\u2014especially in light of the challenging war in Iraq, about which Kirkpatrick shares her \"grave reservations\" here for the first time.With the powerful words that have marked her long and distinguished career, Kirkpatrick explores where we have gone wrong\u2014and raises lingering questions about what perils tomorrow might hold.",

Shakespeare's treatment of the age-old tale of love and betrayal is based on many sources, from Homer and Ovid to Chaucer and Shakespeare's near contemporary Robert Greene.  In the introduction the various problems connected with the play, its performance, and publication, are considered succinctly; its multiple sources are discussed in detail, together with its peculiar stage history and its renewed popularity in recent years.",

With middle age bearing down on him, he takes stock: How has he measured up to his own youthful aspirations? In contemporary America, what is a life well lived? What is a heroic life? From the foothills of Washington's Mount Olympus, through the forgotten corners of America, and finally to his college reunion in Ithaca, New York, Brad shares his personal odyssey. Stopping in classically named towns, he meets everyday heroes, including a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Troy, Oregon;a modern-day hobo in Iliad, Montana;and a bomb-squad soldier in Sparta, Wisconsin. These encounters and Brad's effortlessly infused musings make for an exciting, one-of-a-kind ride.\"A truly epic journey.\"--A.J.

        "Authors": "By Hornfischer, James D.",
        "Description": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\"Son, we\u2019re going to Hell.\" The navigator of the USS Houston confided these prophetic  words to a young officer as he and his captain charted a course into U.S. naval legend.  Renowned as FDR\u2019s favorite warship, the cruiser USS Houston was a prize target trapped  in the far Pacific after Pearl Harbor. Without hope of reinforcement, her crew faced  a superior Japanese force ruthlessly committed to total conquest. It wasn\u2019t a fair  fight, but the men of the Houston would wage it to the death. Hornfischer brings  to life the awesome terror of nighttime naval battles that turned decks into strobe-lit  slaughterhouses, the deadly rain of fire from Japanese bombers, and the almost superhuman  effort of the crew as they miraculously escaped disaster again and again\u2013until their  luck ran out during a daring action in Sunda Strait. There, hopelessly outnumbered,  the Houston was finally sunk and its survivors taken prisoner. For more than three  years their fate would be a mystery to families waiting at home. In the brutal privation  of jungle POW camps dubiously immortalized in such films as The Bridge on the River  Kwai, the war continued for the men of the Houston\u2014a life-and-death struggle to survive  forced labor, starvation, disease, and psychological torture. Here is the gritty,  unvarnished story of the infamous Burma\u2013Thailand Death Railway glamorized by Hollywood,  but which in reality mercilessly reduced men to little more than animals, who fought  back against their dehumanization with dignity, ingenuity, sabotage, will\u2013power\u2014and  the undying faith that their country would prevail. Using journals and letters,  rare historical documents, including testimony from postwar Japanese war crimes tribunals,  and the eyewitness accounts of Houston\u2019s survivors, James Hornfischer has crafted  an account of human valor so riveting and awe-inspiring, it\u2019s easy to forget that  every single word is true.",

        "Description": "\"In men like Traveler and Alcazar we find the beating heart and struggling soul of baseball...\" -Jeff MacGregor, Sports Illustrated; author of Sunday MoneyHowie Traveler never made it as a player-his one major league hit and .091 batting average attest to that. He wascursed with that worst of professional maladies, the ill fortune of almost. Now after years of struggling up the coaching ladder, Howie's finally been given his shot: as manager of the Cleveland Indians. But America's pastime has changed. Whether Howie can spot a small flaw in a batter's swing won't matter if he can't manage his superstar outfielder Jay Alcazar, a slugger with enormous talent (and an ego to match).No crisis on the field fazes Jay and no woman off the field ever rejects him. But one night at the hotel Howie sees something at Jay's door he wishes he hadn't...and it leaves Howie with an impossible choice.From six-time National Sportswriter of the Year and NPR commentator Frank Deford comes a richly detailed, page-turning tale that takes you deep into America's game. From the dugouts to the tabloid scandals, from the lights of the field to the glare of the media, The Entitled is the great novel of baseball's modern era. \"The Entitled is a baseball masterpiece, like The Natural and Field of Dreams; the difference is the plot and the characters depict the true inside world of baseball. Frank Deford writes like he played in the majors for ten years. If you have a passion for baseball, this is a must read.\" -Mike Schmidt, Baseball Hall of Fame \"Frank Deford is not just an immensely talented sportswriter, he's an immensely talented American writer. The Entitled is his wise and pleasurable portrait of a Willy Loman-like baseball manager finally getting his chance in the Bigs late in his career.\" -David Halberstam \"Engrossing...Readers are exposed to a richly textured understanding of baseball and, no less, of estrangement, ambition, mendacity and the search for one's destiny-notwithstanding the cost in human or financial terms.\" -Library Journal \"I loved The Entitled and could not put it down. It was a great read from start to finish with characters that reminded me of the many people I've known and played with-pure baseball.\" ??Lou Piniella, Manager, Chicago Cubs \" The Entitled contains all of the keen insider knowledge one expects of America's premier sports journalist. It also displays Frank Deford's gifts for dialogue and intricate plotting and his poignant grasp of character. It proves once again that Deford can play at the highest level in any league.\" -Michael Mewshaw, author of Year of the Gun \"Deford scores another hit with this novel of athletes behaving badly...tackles timely and provocative issues without flinching.\" -Publishers Weekly",

Michael Volkin discovered that fact soon after 9-11, when his personal vow to serve my country convinced him to enlist in the U.S. Army. As Volkin quickly discovered, he was utterly unprepared for the new world of the military, \u201ca completely different environment full of unknown exercises and acronyms, where can\u2019t eat or talk without permission. Volkin began taking notes on everything and anything with the hope that no one else would have to go through basic training like I did completely unarmed with knowledge that would have eased my transition into the military and allowed me to be more successful.During Operation Enduring/Iraqi Freedom, Volkin organized his notes, interviewed hundreds of other soldiers, and began to write. The result is The Ultimate Basic Training Guidebook, a unique and utterly indispensable guide to successfully coping with and thriving in today\u2019s military.  The Ultimate Basic Training Guidebook is a comprehensive, practical, and easy-to-follow survival guide written specifically for every new or prospective recruit about to enter any branch of the armed forces. Volkin\u2019s book offers step-by-step instructions and solutions, including helpful charts and graphics, for how to prepare both physically and mentally for boot camp. It includes a special eight-week fitness program specifically designed to improve your fitness test scores, specific study guides, an instructional How to\u201dchapter, a list of what to bring (and not to bring) to basic training, tips for success, and much more. The Ultimate Basic Training Guidebook was written by a soldier for men and women who want to become soldiers. No one should enter boot camp without having read this book.",

        "Title": "Hopes and Shadows: Eastern Europe After Communism (Perspectives on the Past and Present)",
        "Authors": "By Brown, J. F.",
        "Description": "After the exuberance that marked the revolutions of 1989, the countries of Eastern Europe have faced the breathtakingly ambitious task of remaking their societies. Simultaneously they have sought to build liberal democracies based on market economics, while confronting reassertions of claims for national independence long suppressed. Taking up where his previous book Surge to Freedom ended, J. F. Brown\u2019s Hopes and Shadows analyzes the results of the first four years of Eastern Europe\u2019s separation from communist rule and the prospects for the future. The forces at work in the midst of this revolution are examined from a perspective that is necessarily both historical and contemporary as the complex relationship between the tasks that face these countries and the legacy of their communist and pre-communist past shape the difficult present. As the usefulness of the designation \"Eastern Europe\" is itself questioned, Brown provides both regional and country-by-country analysis of the political situation. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland are grouped together, as are Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, to address questions such as the development of liberal democratic culture, the activation of democratic institutions and procedures, and the future of former communist bureaucracies. He considers the former Yugoslavia\u2014now torn violently apart\u2014largely as a separate case. The theoretical, political, social, financial, cultural, and psychological dimensions of the transition from socialism to a market economy are discussed in detail. The final aspect of this revolution, the failure of which most immediately threatens the entire process, is the attempt to build new and stable national statehoods. Brown explores the history and impact of the current reemergence of nationalism and the dangers it represents. A comprehensive and authoritative survey, J. F. Brown\u2019s analysis and presentation of the contemporary Eastern European political landscape will be essential reading for scholars and specialists and of great interest to general readers.",

        "Authors": "By Khanna, Parag",
        "Description": "Grand explanations of how to understand the complex twenty-first-century world have all fallen short\u2013until now. In The Second World, the brilliant young scholar Parag Khanna takes readers on a thrilling global tour, one that shows how America\u2019s dominant moment has been suddenly replaced by a geopolitical marketplace wherein the European Union and China compete with the United States to shape world order on their own terms. This contest is hottest and most decisive in the Second World: pivotal regions in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and East Asia. Khanna explores the evolution of geopolitics through the recent histories of such underreported, fascinating, and complicated countries as Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Colombia, Libya, Vietnam, and Malaysia\u2013nations whose resources will ultimately determine the fate of the three superpowers, but whose futures are perennially uncertain as they struggle to rise into the first world or avoid falling into the third.Informed, witty, and armed with a traveler\u2019s intuition for blending into diverse cultures, Khanna mixes copious research with deep reportage to remake the map of the world. He depicts second-world societies from the inside out, observing how globalization divides them into winners and losers along political, economic, and cultural lines\u2013and shows how China, Europe, and America use their unique imperial gravities to pull the second-world countries into their orbits. Along the way, Khanna also explains how Arabism and Islamism compete for the Arab soul, reveals how Iran and Saudi Arabia play the superpowers against one another, unmasks Singapore\u2019s inspirational role in East Asia, and psychoanalyzes the second-world leaders whose decisions are reshaping the balance of power. He captures the most elusive formula in international affairs: how to think like a country.In the twenty-first century, globalization is the main battlefield of geopolitics, and America itself runs the risk of descending into the second world if it does not renew itself and redefine its role in the world. Comparable in scope and boldness to Francis Fukuyama\u2019s The End of History and the Last Man and Samuel P. Huntington\u2019s The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, Parag Khanna\u2019s The Second World will be the definitive guide to world politics for years to come.\u201cA savvy, streetwise primer on dozens of individual countries that adds up to a coherent theory of global politics.\u201d\u2013Robert D. Kaplan, author of Eastward to Tartary and Warrior Politics\u201cA panoramic overview that boldly addresses the dilemmas of the world that our next president will confront.\u201d\u2013Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security advisor\"Parag Khanna's fascinating book takes us on an epic journey around the multipolar world, elegantly combining historical analysis, political theory, and eye-witness reports to shed light on the battle for primacy between the world's new empires.\" \u2013Mark Leonard, Executive Director, European Council on Foreign Relations \"Khanna, a widely recognized expert on global politics, offers an study of the 21st century's emerging \"geopolitical marketplace\" dominated by three \"first world\" superpowers, the U.S., Europe and China... The final pages of his book warn eloquently of the risks of imperial overstretch combined with declining economic dominance and deteriorating quality of life.

        "Authors": "By Stoker, Bram",
        "Description": "A true masterwork of storytelling, Dracula has transcended generation, language, and culture to become one of the most popular novels ever written. It is a quintessential tale of suspense and horror, boasting one of the most terrifying characters ever born in literature: Count Dracula, a tragic, night-dwelling specter who feeds upon the blood of the living, and whose diabolical passions prey upon the innocent, the helpless, and the beautiful. But Dracula also stands as a bleak allegorical saga of an eternally cursed being whose nocturnal atrocities reflect the dark underside of the supremely moralistic age in which it was originally written -- and the corrupt desires that continue to plague the modern human condition.  Pocket Books Enriched Classics present the great works of world literature enhanced for the contemporary reader. This edition of Dracula was prepared by Joseph Valente, Professor of English at the University of Illinois and the author of Dracula's Crypt: Bram Stoker, Irishness, and the Question of Blood, who provides insight into the racial connotations of this enduring masterpiece.",
