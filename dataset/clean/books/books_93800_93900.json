From the Godwines, the Percys, and the Cecils to the so\u2013called \u201cmedia barons\u201d of the 21st century, The Dynasties surveys the ?uctuating fortunes of a privileged elite: their loyalties tested and rewarded, honors bestowed and withdrawn, their successes and failures, their adulteries, schemes, bloody battles, murderous plots, and shocking executions\u2014stories that reveal the true powers behind the throne.",

        "Description": "Whistlin' Dixie in a Nor'Easter is the story of a sweet Southern belle who leaves her beloved Memphis, Tennessee to follow her husband's dream of becoming the proprietor of a quaint Vermont inn.Leelee Satterfield seemed to have it all: a gorgeous husband, two adorable daughters, and roots in the sunny city of Memphis, Tennessee. So when her husband gets the idea to uproot the family to run a quaint Vermont inn, Leelee is devastated\u2026and her three best friends are outraged. But she's loved Baker Satterfield since the tenth grade, how can she not indulge his dream? Plus, the glossy photos of bright autumn trees and smiling children in ski suits push her over the edge\u2026after all, how much trouble can it really be? But Leelee discovers pretty fast that there's a truckload of things nobody tells you about Vermont until you live there: such as mud season, vampire flies, and the danger of ice sheets careening off roofs. Not to mention when her beloved Yorkie decides to pick New Year's Eve to go to doggie heaven-she encounters one more New England oddity: frozen ground means you can't bury your dead in the winter. And that Yankee idiosyncrasy just won't do. The inn they've bought also has its host of problems: an odor that no amount of potpourri can erase, tacky d\u00e9cor, and a staff of peculiar Vermonters whose personalities are as unique as the hippopotamus collection gracing the fireplace mantle. The whole operation is managed by Helga, a stern German woman who takes special delight in bullying Leelee for her southern gentility. Needless to say, it doesn't take long for Leelee to start wondering when to drag out the moving boxes again.But when an unexpected hardship takes Leelee by surprise, she finds herself left alone with an inn to run, a mortgage to pay, and two daughters to raise. But this Southern belle won't be run out of town so easily. Drawing on the Southern grit and inner strength she didn't know she had, Leelee decides to turn around the Inn, her attitude and her life. In doing so, she makes friends with her neighbors, finds a little romance, and realizes there's a lot more in common with Vermont than she first thought.In this moving and comedic debut, Lisa Patton paints a hilarious portrait of life in Vermont as seen through the eyes of a southern belle readers won't soon forget. A charming fish-out-of-water tale of one woman who learns to stand up for herself-in sandals and snow boots-against the odds.",

Dinner with Persephone is an indelible masterwork about a place and a people whose culture has influenced us all.With great smartness of style, winning detail, and infectious humor, acclaimed poet and essayist Patricia Storace magically conjures up noisy, anarchic cities and quiet, idyllic towns and harbors, where the unseen worlds of the past - the Roman, the Byzantine, the Ottoman - continue to make their presence felt. She evokes with sympathy and irony the social mores and religious customs and rites of a highly varied and paradoxical people who contentiously affirm their legacy as Greeks but suffer at the same time from profound xenomania - a people fascinated by the dual nature of all things: the transsexual, the biracial, the mother/whore.",
