        "Description": "A landmark biography. The full-scale, riveting, hitherto untold story of Marlene Dietrich as only her daughter, Maria Riva - from girlhood through most of her life her mother's confidant and companion - knows it and can tell it.With her total recall of the detail and texture of her mother's life, she powerfully evokes a woman, a career, a world. Here is Dietrich the child - the adored Maria Magdalena - raised meticulously by a mother who knew her place as a successful tradesman's daughter in Berlin society and her duty as a good wife...the adolescent Lena, revealed in Dietrich's voluminous and emotional life-long diaries (at age seventeen: \"Somebody told me I looked like a doll one wants to keep on kissing\"...\"I had a very big fight with Mutti. She said that as I 'hang' around with all those schoolboys, that I must be boy crazy\"... \"Countess Gersdorf, your feet are pink my heart is set on fire for you...\").We see the young Marlene, the energetic, disciplined, quickly successful actress whose mother equated actors with shiftless tambourine-playing thieves...Marlene about to marry Rudolf Sieber (\"He was dressed like an English lord on his country estate. A little assistant director in real tweeds. Right away I knew I loved him!\")... Marlene totally trusting her husband's impeccable instinct for an approach that would work for his actress-wife: to play vulgarity but not become it, to startle the world but maintain the aloofness of an aristocrat.Here is Dietrich in the Berlin of the 1920s, becoming recognized for her sharp wit, her bisexual sensuality; in top hat, white tie, and tails (made by her husband's tailor), visiting cabarets where transvestites congregated and performed, embodying for them all they yearned to be...Marlene seen through the eyes of her young daughter (\"At age three, I knew quite definitely that I did not have a mother, I belonged to a queen\").Dietrich is here in all of her incarnations: Sternberg's muse and collaborator in The Blue Angel, Morocco, Shanghai Express, The Scarlet Empress, The Devil Is a Woman (\"Mister von Sternberg is a... god! A Master! No wonder they all hate him...He paints, like Rembrandt, with his lights\"). And without him, Dietrich floundering until, with her understanding of what he had done and how he had done it, she was able herself to create Shanghai Lily in all her luminous beauty and to take command of Marlene Dietrich, the Movie Star.We see Dietrich the international symbol of unattainable glamour...Dietrich as Box Office Poison...Dietrich reborn as (almost) the girl next door, in Destry Rides Again...Dietrich in control of her husband, her husband's mistress, her own daughter, her own lovers, her films (the minutest detail of costume and lighting)...Dietrich the Romantic...Dietrich visiting Colette, talking till dawn with Erich Maria Remarque, searching for Jean Gabin in Algiers, adored by Brian Aherne, helplessly in love with Yul Brynner, palling around with Noel Coward and Cole Porter...Dietrich desiring - needing - ultimate Romance, passionate declarations of eternal devotion; her lovers unwittingly playing the roles she cast them in.Dietrich in her fifties and sixties, Vegas star, SRO concert performer around the world again, and again, and again...Dietrich in her eighties, divorcing herself from the world, making herself invisible, devoting herself to the immortality of The Legend.But what we have said barely does justice to the rich complexity of the story told, the woman revealed, the world portrayed in Maria Riva's astonishing work. Her biography of her mother has the depth, the range, and the resonance of the nineteenth-century novel and the conviction and feeling of life passionately recollected.",

M. Thomas, Paul Auster, and others, and the paintings of Edward Hopper, Francis Bacon, and Pablo Picasso to guide her self-discovery, Grumbach returns to her inner self and the source of her creativity.",

On the contrary, their marriage flourished right up to the time of Rose's death more than fifty years after the wedding. So, at seventy-five, Conrad finds himself horribly alone, rejecting offers of consolation, neglecting Rose's garden for the four months since her death.Even so, it's there - in that ragged and overgrown paradise - that an apparation confronts the grieving, distraught widower one blustery fall night. Had it been Rose, Conrad might have found a way to follow her. It isn't Rose, though - it's someone else altogether.And the visitation is so startling that Conrad, who believed he would never want any human company beyond Rose's, feels compelled to spread the news. In some cases, his description of the encounter falls on deaf ears (his neighbor, the fearful widow May Brown is afraid of the dark, much less ghosts), but others in the small New Hampshire town are drawn to his story.When storm rains break a dam and flood waters threaten the town and its people, Conrad realizes how deeply he belongs, how much he wants to save it all. A loner who found himself all too alone, Conrad learns the precious lesson of reaching out, a lesson Rose tried all her life to teach him.",

Turning her back on painful memories as well as heavy sauces, she's committed to helping America rediscover its palate by focusing on natural cooking, from Cal-Ital to nouvelle Tex-Mex. There's one problem, though: someone is killing the great chefs of America.As the police round up the usual suspects, Natasha finds herself cheek to cheek with her ex-husband, Maximilian (Mr. Fast Food) Ogden - a.k.a. Millie - as they try to put aside their culinary differences to establish their innocence and find the killer. Despite Natasha's determination not to let history repeat itself - and not to fall in love with Millie again - American chefs are found dead in a series of brutal tableaux that could only have been conceived by that psychopathic gourmand, the legendary Achille van Golk. But Achille is dead - n'est-ce pas?The past begins to intrude upon the present. Faster than bistro food captured New York, Natasha turns up on someone's menu as the next victim. But who is the culprit? Is it the exotic Mrs. Nakamura, head of Fuji Food, who has an insatiable appetite for Millie? The neurotic food critic Roy Drake, who has made an art of killing chefs - though heretofore only with his poison pen? The prim Miss Beauchamp, a secretary scorned, who was secretly in love with Achille? Or is it that most dangerous monster of all - the fat person inside every thin person who is desperate to escape?All is revealed as the book reaches its hilarious high-calorie climax at the Culinary Olympics in Paris, where foodies of the world become part of the obsessive plot to kill Natasha.",

The City of Brotherly Love has been proclaimed number one in the nation...for hostility. English teacher Amanda Pepper, crabbily gearing up for summer school at exclusive Philly Prep, feels she fits right in with the hostility mode.And it's going to get worse. Amanda gets her first prickling of unease in her own classroom, where a reading of Romeo and Juliet activates some very strange chemistry. Then the computer science teacher begins receiving anonymous \"go-back-to-Africa\" phone calls. A young Vietnamese boy dies in a drive-by shooting. And late one night, outside a Chinatown massage parlor, student April Tuong is kidnapped.Random violence? Perhaps. But Amanda refuses to let gentle April vanish without at least asking a few questions, starting in her own classroom.Gillian Roberts's Philadelphia is the real thing. So, too, are her wit and humor, and her gripping story of Amanda's tenacious search for the missing girl--along the brick streets of historic Philadelphia, in exotic Chinatown, and through the shady, sinister back alleys of the impoverished. The truth, when she finds it, is appalling, deadly, and much too close to home.",

        "Authors": "By Morton, Andrew",
        "Description": "The publication in 1992 of Andrew Morton's number-one national bestseller, Diana: Her True Story, shook the British royal family to its very foundations. The book's many revelations - that Prince Charles had been having a long-term affair, that the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales had been a sham, that the Princess had been suffering from an eating disorder and had made several halfhearted suicide attempts - were initially greeted with disbelief. But as time passed, it became clear that the book was, as its title claimed, Diana's true story, especially when the couple announced their separation in December 1992. When Prince Charles eventually admitted his adultery on television, he put the final seal of confirmation on Andrew Morton's claims.Diana's friends were hopeful that the separation from Charles, which ended years of a torturous existence, would bring Diana the freedom to find happiness in a new role. But has she? With her marriage in limbo and her children only occasionally by her side, Diana's position in the royal family is one of increasing isolation. Diana: Her New Life chronicles the secret battles that have raged behind closed doors, and Diana's constant frustration as she endeavors to break free from the restrictions of her semi-detached royal life.Again with unprecedented access to some of Diana's closest friends and advisers, Andrew Morton is able to strip away the royal propaganda and reveal how Diana, who became a princess before she had reached maturity, is at last learning to become a woman in her own right rather than a puppet of the palace. Andrew Morton exposes the infighting and intrigue behind this most sensational royal crisis, as well as Diana's private thoughts on her retirement from public life, remarriage, the men in her life, and the grooming of Prince William for his future role.Illustrated with 32 pages of remarkable color photographs, Diana: Her New Life is a revealing, explosive look at the struggle of one of the world's most intriguing and beloved women.",

On a trip to Key West to talk with a wealthy developer about a new building project, Deal stops to help a young black man who is being rousted by police on a lonely beach road. The young man is appreciative-which makes it all the more shocking two days later, when he turns up dead. What happened? The police won't say. The locals won't talk. An old girlfriend appears, but Deal can't tell if she's there to help or hinder him. References keep being made to a seventy-year-old tale of piracy and murder as if it should mean something to him. All Deal knows for sure is that the more he looks into it all, the more layers he finds, and the more people seem to have died. And that, unless he can get to the bottom of it soon, the next death just might be his own.  Filled with intense, character-driven action and rich, textured prose, Bone Key proves again why \"Standiford's stories are some of the best suspense novels out there\" (Rocky Mountain News).",

Many of his new techno-economy rules invert traditional wisdom: initial successes aren't self-limiting, but self-feeding (increasing returns); value is carried by abundance; generosity begets wealth (free stuff equals consumer attention); and the highly successful must be abandoned in order to escape its eventual obsolescence.

        "Description": "One of America's foremost prognosticators and author of the bestseller and management classic The Art of the Long View discusses the big surprises ahead, the resulting scenarios that are creating the future of our world, and what they will mean for you and your business.  The world we live in today is more volatile than ever. At times it seems that the only constant we can rely on is change itself-and what the future will bring appears to be anybody's guess. But Peter Schwartz, one of the most visionary scenario planners of our time, believes the future is taking shape around us now, and that by taking a closer look at the changes in action today, we can predict what the world of tomorrow will be like.  With Inevitable Surprises, Schwartz offers a provocative look at the forces that are dramatically reshaping our world-and shows what we can do to plan ahead for our society, our businesses, and ourselves. Each chapter takes a predetermined new reality that we will soon face-including regenerative medicine, global climate change, an aging population in the West, and the rise of terrorism-and offers critical foresight for the coming decades. Ultimately, Schwartz brings his analyses of these developments together to offer three overarching scenarios that are possible directions for world history in the coming years, and outlines the implications for each.  Timely, thought-provoking, and endlessly fascinating, Peter Schwartz's Inevitable Surprises is a book no one in business-or anyone with an interest in the future-can afford to miss.",

That day these rousing ball clubs would meet at Fenway Park. Both had won ninety-nine games. Only one would win one hundred. The Yankees should have been reaching for their golf clubs-they had feuded until they were fourteen games out of first place. Then their fortunes turned, and they capped one of the most thrilling comebacks in baseball history by defeating the Red Sox that October afternoon in a game that many still remember as the greatest ever played. Transporting us into the midst of this unforgettable team, Roger Kahn weaves the first in-depth account of the legendary season of '78 and reaffirms his standing as our nation's master storyteller of baseball.",

        "Description": "For over twenty years Robert Littell was John F. Kennedy Jr.'s closest confidant.  Now, in a beautiful and moving memoir, Littell introduces us to the private John.  A story of laughter and sorrow, joy and heartbreak, The Men We Became is an unforgettable memoir.  Rob Littell was a freshman at Brown when he met the young JFK, Jr. during orientation week.  Although Littell came from a privileged background, it was worlds apart from the glamorous life of the son of the late President and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.  Eager to be accepted on his own terms, Kennedy admired Littell's irreverence toward his celebrity and they became close friends.   John opened up to Littell on a very personal level, revealing the complex and sometimes tense nature of his relationships with his sister and cousins, as well as his mother's extraordinary influence on John - and how they both worked to keep it from being overbearing.  John's marriage had its ups and downs and Carolyn had made enemies of some of his friends, but she was in great shape mentally and physically and they were planning to have children. Littell recounts wonderful dinners at Jacqueline Onassis's apartment where she surprised him with his favorite dinner of specially burned hamburgers and weekends at her retreat in Martha's Vineyard where she critiqued their touch football while lying on a chaise lounge, her face covered in cold cream and cucumber slices.  As students, Littell and Kennedy bummed around Europe.  They slept in Hyde Park, sampled the pleasures of Amsterdam, ran afoul of customs officers and almost got busted at the Ritz Hotel for smoking pot.  They even shared apartments in New York City until Jackie summoned them to dinner one day and gently suggested it was time to grow up.  The two went on to pursue their professional lives.  John trained as a lawyer - and Littell speaks of his friend's anguish at repeatedly failing the bar - and then he founded his own political magazine, which seemed only fitting because Kennedy yearned to live up to the family name and accepted that politics would be his destiny.  Later on, Littell was a part of JFK, Jr.'s secret wedding to Carolyn Bessette on Cumberland Island, Georgia, and three years later a pallbearer at his funeral.From shared adventures, private moments and lasting memories, Robert Littell offers a unique look at John F. Kennedy Jr.'s life - one that has never been seen before. For over twenty years Robert Littell was John F. Kennedy Jr.'s closest confidant.

The wife he adored was recently dead, his once thriving practice had withered, he had stumbled into early retirement. And relations with his beloved and perfectly bred daughter couldn't have been worse: she mercilessly decided to marry one of Schmidt's former partners, a man odious to Schmidt for reasons too shameful to admit. The only glimmer of salvation was his unlikely, and mysteriously dangerous, love affair with Carrie, a Puerto Rican waitress younger than his daughterWithin the modest luxury of his Hamptons home, Schmidtie rediscovers domestic bliss, with Carrie. He keeps his own hours and steers his own course, even as he becomes increasingly ensnared by the odd Levantine billionaire Michael Mansour. (Is Mansour a real friend, or just a big cat playing with a WASP mouse?) Among Schmidt's other satisfactions is the thought of the cold dish of \"I told you so\" he could serve himself as his yuppie daughter's marriage founders on a scandal that engulfs the detested son-in-law. Where will it all lead? Can May and December remain on the same calendar as the sun sets? Will the irrepressible Schmidtie remain content in his deck chair indefinitely?",

        "Title": "Daughters of Britannia: The Lives and Times of Diplomatic Wives",
        "Authors": "By Hickman, Katie",
        "Description": "In an absorbing mixture of poignant biography and wonderfully entertaining social history, Daughters of Britannia offers the story of diplomatic life as it has never been told before. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Vita Sackville-West and Lady Diana Cooper are among the wellknown wives of diplomats who represented Britain in the far-flung corners of the globe. Yet, despite serving such crucial roles, the vast majority of these women are entirely unknown to history. Who was Mrs Vigor, gossiping from St Petersburg in the 1730s about the intrigues of the imperial court, or Miss Tully, incarcerated in the British consulate in famine-torn Tripoli on the eve of the French Revolution? Drawing on letters, private journals and memoirs, as well as contemporary oral history, Katie Hickman explores not only the public pomp and glamour of diplomatic life, but also the most intimate, private face of this most fascinating and rays mysterious world. Far from leading pampered lives of luxury and privilege, many women endured harsh, isolated circumstances that they continuously met with remarkable resourcefulness and strength: journeys could take many months to complete, medical facilities were often primitive or nonexistent and young children frequently died due to the conditions, not to mention wars, kidnappings and assassination attempts. Katie Hickman balances stories of high drama with detailed recollections of domestic life in which women faced such daily challenges as getting their husbands' shirt fronts suitably boiled and starched in the wilds of Xinkiang or finding the right size bulletproof vest in which to do the gardening in Beirut. Touching on the lives of nearly a hundred diplomatic wives (as well as sisters and daughters), Daughters of Britannia is a brilliant and compelling account of more than three centuries of British diplomacy as seen through the eyes of some of its most intrepid but least heralded participants.",

And in Jonathan Kellerman's riveting and ingenious new novel, Monster, he faces one of the most grisly and baffling mysteries of his career: How can a nonfunctional psychotic locked up in a supposedly secure institution for homicidal madmen predict brutal murders in the outside world? Delaware and his friend and partner Detective Milo Sturgis must penetrate this enigma in order to stop the horrific killings.A marginal actor is found dead in a car trunk, sawn in half. Months later, a psychologist at a hospital for the criminally insane is discovered murdered and mutilated in a tantalizingly similar way. When reports of an inmate's incoherent ramblings begin to make frightening sense as predictions of yet more slayings, Delaware and Sturgis are drawn into a web of family secrets, vengeance, and manipulation--both inside the asylum and on the streets of L.A., where death, drugs, and sex are marketed as commodities. The climactic discovery they make as they race to prevent more killings gives fresh and terrifying meaning to the concept of monstrosity.With Monster's incomparably deft characterizations and dazzlingly dark plot twists, Jonathan Kellerman further enhances his literary position as master of the psychological thriller.",

        "Authors": "By Brown, Rosellen",
        "Description": "Rosellen Brown's long-awaited novel is the extraordinary story of a family's struggle to survive the throes of tragedy. Set in the small town of Hyland, the backdrop for Brown's Tender Mercies, Before and After centers on Carolyn and Ben Reiser and their two children, Judith and Jacob, who have moved to New England for the comforts of rural life. Carolyn is a pediatrician who devotes her time and energy to making young lives painless and healthy. Ben is a sculptor whose imagination works overtime, yielding strange creatures of benevolent, almost totemic significance. Jacob is their seventeen-year-old son, whose shyness conceals darker impulses he keeps hidden from his parents. And Judith is his unforgettable sister, puzzled by her brother's secrecy and sexual preoccupations, suspicious of his suppressed anger.When the chief of police comes looking for Jacob one evening to question him about the bludgeoning to death of his teenage girlfriend, the Reisers' lives are changed forever. Before and After is the compelling drama of the search for Jacob, his capture, and the chain of events set in motion by a brutal crime of passion. It's a story that pits parent against parent, brother against sister, family against community, blood loyalty against the law. With a flawless ear for dialogue and a profound understanding of character and motive, Rosellen Brown has given us a heart-wrenching novel that questions the very nature of violence in our society and our ability to ever really know our children. Beautifully written, compassionate and wise, Before and After confirms Rosellen Brown's reputation as a writer who \"can do anything with language . . . She can engender and render five emotions simultaneously, and throw over a whole novel a skein of sureness and sympathy\" (Cynthia Ozick).",
