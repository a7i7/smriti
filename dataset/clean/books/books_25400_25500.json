        "Authors": "By Guaspari, John",
        "Description": "Everybody says that Quality is it: the revered panacea for all corporate ills, the business obsession, the solution of solutions. Except what do you do when you've achieved Quality but it still isn't enough? When you've tried your darnedest, but the competition still has the edge? That's exactly the dilemma that faces the leader of Punctuation, Inc., the prosperous company featured in this business fable, It's About Time. Despite Punctuation, Inc.'s world-renowned quality and concern for customer satisfaction, a brash new company has appeared on the scene. Its products aren't simply just as good and just as inventive, but new ones keep appearing faster than seems possible!!In It's About Time, John Guaspari, quality expert and bestselling author, offers a bedtime story for companies that ought to be waking up to a new business reality - that time is the next competitive weapon. This unique, witty tale provides an eye-opening presentation of the basics of \"time-based competition\" - an approach destined to be the management paradigm for the 1990s. It's About Time continues the story of Guaspari's first fable, I Know It When I See It, which explained a crucial message about how to measure quality (let the customer define it). With over 250,000 copies sold to date, I Know It When I See It proved that a light-hearted approach to a serious business concept is a lucid (and time-saving) way to get an idea across.Now, with It's About Time, managers and employees at all levels receive a powerful (and memorable) introduction in just forty-five minutes to today's critical business topic - that you've got to make it, market it, and sell it, not just better, but faster than your rivals.Isn't it about time we all got the message?",

As he moved from west to east - from Berlin glamour to Berlin danger - the East German secret police, the so-called Stasi, was compiling a secret file on his activities, monitoring his Berlin days and nights and tracking his growing involvement with the Solidarity movement in Poland.Fifteen years later, with the wall torn down and Berlin now unified, Garton Ash visited Stasi headquarters to find his file. The thick dossier he was given forms the basis for this real-life thriller in which he traces and confronts the German friends and acquaintances who informed on him, and the officers who hired them. Behind Stasi reports of suspicious meetings we discover the love affairs, friendships, and formative intellectual encounters that actually occurred. And behind a baffling web of lies, half-truths, and forgotten stories we find a forty-year-old man spying on his younger self.",

But Nina is wholly unprepared for her latest client - sixteen-year-old Nicole Zack, a rebel, a thief, and the best friend of Nina's teenage son, Bob. Did Nikki steal something from her uncle, a prominent plastic surgeon, and then kill him with an ancient samurai sword? The district attorney is trying Nikki as an adult and the charge is first degree murder.With the stakes this high, Nina calls in private investigator Paul Van Wagoner, her ex-lover and constant ally, whose bravado conceals a troubling personal secret. As Paul investigates the eerily coincidental death of the surgeon's son - killed in a plane crash the same night his father was murdered - Nina sorts through the twisting lies surrounding Nikki, uncovering a bitter struggle over a mining claim, enraged former patients, and two old crimes. Finally, Nina must confront the central question she needs to answer in order to save her client: What did Nikki really see the night of her uncle's murder?",

        "Title": "Pictures at an Execution : An Inquiry into the Subject of Murder",
        "Authors": "By Lesser, Wendy",
        "Description": "This book is about murder - in life and in art - and about how we look at it and feel about it. At the center of Wendy Lesser's investigation is a groundbreaking legal case in which a federal court judge was asked to decide whether a gas chamber execution would be broadcast on public television. Our grim and seemingly endless fascination with murder gets its day in court as Lesser conducts us through the proceedings, pausing along the way to reflect on the circumstances of violent death in our culture. Her book, itself a murder mystery of sorts, circling suspensefully around a central point, is also a meditation on murder in a civilized society - what we make of it in law, morality, and art.Lesser narrates the trial with a sharp eye for detail and an absorbing sense of character. Questions that arise in the courtroom conjure other, broader ones why are we drawn to murder, as an act and as a spectacle? Who in a murder story are we drawn to - victim, murderer, detective? Is such interest, even pleasure, morally suspect? Lesser's reflections on these questions follow the culture in its danse macabre, from Norman Mailer's The Executioner's Song to the Jacobean play The Changeling, from Errol Morris's documentary The Thin Blue Line to Crime and Punishment, from Janet Malcolm's The Journalist and the Murderer to Jim Thompson's The Killer Inside Me, from Weegee's photographs to television's movie of the week. Always anchored in the courtroom, where the question of murder as theater is being settled in immediate, human terms, this circle of thought widens outward to the increasingly blurred borderline between real and fictional murder, between event and story, between murder as news and murder as art. As gripping as its subject, Pictures at an Execution brings us face to face with our own most disturbing cultural impulses.",

What they don't know is that the two older children, thirteen-year-old Matthew and his sister Annie, will take control of their house, their siblings, and their father.As soon as the bereaved Mr. Heenan returns from his wife's hospital deathbed, Annie and Matthew realize that their lives as carefree children have come to an abrupt and premature end. Dad isn't just mourning. He's insane, muttering about \"sin\" and \"punishment,\" and retreating to a little upstairs bedroom, hardly ever to emerge.If the authorities discover Mr. Heenan's true condition, the children will be separated and taken into \"care.\" Anything is preferable, so instead of playing with their classmates after school, Annie and Matthew learn to cook and clean and watch out for the little ones. And they learn how to lie.The charade can't continue forever, and soon the townspeople begin to wonder why Mr. Heenan never visits his usual haunts. But the real trouble starts when Annie and Matthew find a body in their backyard. Now the police will discover the true situation at the house - unless the children can dispose of the bloodied corpse.Gripping and poignant, The Masters of the House affirms Robert Barnard's extraordinary and versatile talent. It is vintage Barnard from beginning to shocking end.",

        "Description": "If the unexamined life is not worth living, surely the unexamined media is not worth heeding. Sentinel Under Siege traces the evolution of the media in the United States and its capacity to examine and regulate itself, from its earliest colonial roots to the modern explosion of digital technology.Once the Bill of Rights was enacted in 1791, the press became the first and only enterprise explicitly protected by the United States Constitution. This book is concerned with the legal content given to freedom of the press by the Supreme Court, and the fitful attempts of media criticism\u2014both intramural and external\u2014to build a greater sense of responsibility among the practitioners.Stanley Flink, former correspondent of Life Magazine and writer/producer at NBC and CBS, is concerned less with the people\u2019s right to know than with the people\u2019s need to know. Only a competent, responsible press\u2014whatever its means of distribution\u2014can perform the role of watchdog over official abuse of power, business corruption, and political distortions. But the acquisition of so many newspapers, magazines, and broadcasting facilities by corporate conglomerates threatens a new kind of prior restraint on an independent press\u2014the conflicts of interest; the power of advertising; the unspoken self-censorship of reporters and editors, print or electronic, based on the perceived predilections of their employers; and the financial interests of related companies.Flink believes that responsible journalism can also be economically viable in the twenty-first century because the mass communication of reliable news reporting and media accountability will be vital to the democratic process. Unless the news media persistently seeks the high moral ground of public service, the first casualty will be an informed electorate. The second may well be constitutional protection.",

He's an avid hunter and fisherman who can advise on the best bait for catfish and on dressing freshly shot quail. He makes his living off the stock market, but he moonlights as a sleuth for the lawyer who is Pensacola's patron saint of hopeless causes.In this case, Hunt comes to the aid of a \"blue chipper,\" the high school basketball star William Coleman. As dazzling in the classroom as he is on the court, Coleman faces the devil's bargain of surrendering his dreams or sending his hoodlum brother to the electric chair. Unraveling the extortion scheme draws Hunt into the dark web of university recruiters, for whom athletes are mere prey to be exploited and discarded - and whose corruption can even encompass murder.James Crumley called the first Morgan Hunt mystery, Sweetwater Ranch, \"one of those wonders that transcend the genre,\" and Christopher Buckley hailed it as a \"hell of a satisfying story.\" Newsweek praised its evocation of the Florida panhandle \"with its bait and tackle shops, piney woods, palmetto, sluggish streams, and sawgrass marshes...[the] Florida never seen on picture postcards.\"Blue Chipper is equally vivid and atmospheric - a fast-paced drama of gripping suspense and a chilling glimpse at the underbelly of college athletics.",

Journalism was a tough profession. Police reporters were on the take from mobsters and editors paid more attention to advertisers than to readers. Reporters carried phony police badges and hid pints of bad whiskey in their bottom drawers. They smoked. They drank. And Royko out-wrote the best of them. He insulted and taunted the most vicious killers in Chicago and the most powerful big city boss of the century. He exposed graft and greed. He damned hypocrisy and he defended the little man.Mike Royko was also haunted by conflict. A difficult man, he would intimidate his assistants every morning and retire to the Billy Goat Tavern every night. He was arrogant and kind. He was incomparably witty and suddenly morose. He was vain and insecure. He played hard and he wrote harder and longer than any other newspaperman.Royko: A Life in Print not only tells the story of one of America's greatest newspapermen, but also explores the dramatic developments in journalism and in American society over the course of the twentieth century.",

        "Title": "River Angel: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Ansay, A. Manette",
        "Description": "In April 1991, in a little Wisconsin town about a hundred miles southwest of the town where I grew up, a misfit boy was kidnapped by a group of high school kids who, later, would testify they'd merely meant to frighten him, to drive him around for a while. Somehow they ended up at the rive, whooping and hollering on a two-lane bridge. Somehow the boy was shoved, he jumped, he slipped\u2014acounts vary\u2014into the icy water. The kids told police they never heard a splash; one reported seeing a brilliant flash of light. (Several people in the area witnessed a similar light, while others recalled hearing something \"kind of like thunder.\") All night, volunteers walked the river's edge, but it was dawn before the body was found in a barn a good mile from the bridge . . .The owner of the barn had been the one to discover the body, and she said the boy's cheeks were rosy, his skin warm to the touch. A sweet smell hung in the air. \"It was,\" she said \"as if he were just sleeping.\" And then she told police she believed an angel had carried him there.For years, it had been said that an angel lived in the river. Residents flipped coins into the water for luck, and a few claimed they had seen the angel, or known someone who'd seen it. The historical society downtown had a farmwife's journal, dated 1898, in which a woman described how an angel had rescued her family from a flood. Now, as the story of the boy's death spread, more people came forward with accounts of strange things that had happened on that night. Dogs had barked without ceasing till dawn; livestock broke free of padlocked barns. Someone's child crayoned a bridge and, above it, a wide-winged tapioca angel.A miracle? A hoax? Or something in between? With acute insight and great compassion, A. Manette Ansay captures the inner life of a town and its residents struggling to forge a new identity in the face of a rapidly changing world.",

        "Title": "On the Social Utility of Psychopathology: A Deviant Majority and Its Keepers",
        "Authors": "By Pallone, Nathaniel J.",
        "Description": "Nathaniel Pallone argues that, whatever else is true of psycho-pathology, it serves purposes which are socially useful. What\u00adever else is true of its clinical treatment, such treatment func\u00adtions as a form of social regula\u00adtion. In societal terms, such treat\u00adment may serve purposes quite other than the relief of psycho\u00adlogical disease or even the remedy of psychological disorder. If psychopathology had not emerged naturally, society might have needed to engender psychopathogenic conditions both to fulfill so\u00adcially useful purposes and to elicit that subtle mechanism for social regulation we term \"psychother\u00adapy.\" Pallone constructs his ar\u00adgument by summing up the evi\u00addence for two points which apply to all psychotherapeutic practice: that the relief of psychopathology is in no dependable way associ\u00adated with psychotherapeutic treatment; and that in all schools of psychotherapy, the only clear-cut criterion for terminating treatment is the limit of the pa\u00adtient's financial resources.What surprised me in this manu\u00adscript is the stark simplicity with which Pallone constructs his ar\u00adgument [that] society acquires the license to create unlimited [psy\u00adchological] disease, to define this disease as intolerable, to finance armies of disease alleviators providing 'treatments' that are in even more profound contradic\u00adtion with each other than were the religions of old.... The illustra\u00adtion[s] make Pallone's argument crystal clear. - Ivan Illich, from the Preface",

        "Description": "The gripping and inspiring story of two extraordinary women--from their imprisonment by the Taliban to their rescue by U.S. Special Forces. When Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer arrived in Afghanistan, they had come to help bring a better life and a little hope to some of the poorest and most oppressed people in the world. Within a few months, their lives were thrown into chaos as they became pawns in historic international events.  They were arrested by the ruling Taliban government for teaching about Christianity to the people with whom they worked.  In the middle of their trial, the events of September 11, 2001, led to the international war on terrorism, with the Taliban a primary target.  While many feared Curry and Mercer could not survive in the midst of war, Americans nonetheless prayed for their safe return, and in November their prayers were answered.In Prisoners of Hope, Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer tell the story of their work in Afghanistan, their love for the people they served, their arrest, trial, and imprisonment by the Taliban, and their rescue by U.S. Special Forces. The heart of the book will discuss how two middle-class American women decided to leave the comforts of home in exchange for the opportunity to serve the disadvantaged, and how their faith motivated them and sustained them through the events that followed.  Their story is a magnificent narrative of ordinary women caught in extraordinary circumstances as a result of their commitment to serve the poorest and most oppressed women and children in the world. This book will be inspiring to those who seek a purpose greater than themselves.",

In this age of computers and form letters, Joyce's examples can help us recover a time-honored tradition that goes back to biblical days.You'll find sample letters in chapters that offer \"special words\" for: Special Days - birthdays, weddings, anniversaries of all sorts; Thanks - and not just your ordinary thank-you cards; Relationships - including love notes for the pillows of your loved ones; appreciation of neighbors, fellow church members, and those who help you; people in grief or pain, including the sick, the ostracized, and the deeply wounded; Apologies - both lighthearted and deeply healing; people with specific hurts, such as mothers who have miscarried; \"Balcony People\" - those who cheer for you and those you cheer for; appreciation of an employer and thanks to a prospective employer; and the person whose name comes up in prayer times.There are even samples for letters that you will never send, but that should be written - those letters to the difficult ones in our lives whom we don't wish to hurt but whom we must address silently. In addition, in a chapter all its own, Joyce offers hard-won wisdom and sample letters for those deeply affected by breast cancer.Best of all, each chapter starts out with Joyce's \"letters\" to the reader - her own \"special words\" offering the compassion, encouragement, and deep sensitivity Joyce's readers have loved and learned to depend on.",
