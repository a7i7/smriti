        "Title": "A Long Way from Tipperary: What a Former Monk Discovered in His Search for the Truth",
        "Authors": "By Crossan, John Dominic",
        "Description": "I have spent thirty years reconstructing the historical Jesus. I have done so self-consciously and self-critically and have tried to do the same on reconstructing myself. But what justifies this memoir is how my own personal experience, from Ireland to America, from priest to professor, from monastery to university, and ... from celibacy to marriage, may have influenced that reconstruction. Where has it helped me see what others have not, and where has it made invisible to me what others find obvious?-from A Long Way from TipperaryFrom his upbringing in Ireland to front-page coverage in the New York Times and mention in cover stories in Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report, John Dominic Crossan-who has courageously pioneered the contemporary quest for the historical Jesus-has dared to go his own way. In this candid and engaging memoir, the world's foremost Jesus scholar reveals what he has discovered over a lifetime of open-eyed, fearless exploration of God, Jesus, Christianity, and himself. Crossan shares his provocative thinking on such issues as how one can be a Christian without going to church; whether God is vengeful, or just, or both; and why Jesus is more like Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. than like the Pope or Jerry Falwell.Raised in the traditional Irish Catholic Church, Crossan inherited a faith that was \"accepted fully and internalized completely but undiscussed, uninvestigated, and uncriticized.\" A dauntless spirit whose imagination was ignited not by piety but by the lure and challenge of adventure, he became a monk to travel and explore the world, unaware that his most thrilling quests would be scholarly and spiritual. \"God had going the best adventure around,\" Crossan confesses.Because he could never subject his theological convictions and historical findings to the restrictions of the Church, Crossan chose to leave the monastery and priesthood. Speaking of this time in his life, Crossan writes, \"Not even a vow of obedience could make me sing a song I did not hear.\" But he never abandoned the Roman Catholic community or tradition and never lost his faith. He has devoted his life and career to a reexamination of what he calls \"necessary open-heart surgery on Christianity itself.\"",

Mismanagement of economic policy threatens both the United States' position in the international system and our national security. Moran examines three economic threats that could endanger America's national security: America's fundamental and cumulative decline relative to the other major industrial states; a loss of crucial economic and technological capabilities within our own country; and the growing dependence on other countries for vital goods, services, and technologies. He explores the nature of each threat and analyzes the policy alternatives to meet it. Moran argues that the policy responses of greatest benefit to the Unites Stats cannot be  based soley on economic criteria. Instead, American policymakers must construct what the author calls a \"grand stategy\" that envisions an international system that best serves American intersts and includes an assessment of the ability of American political leaders to guide the public in ways that support this system.",

Surviving passengers recount heart-breaking tales of parting with loved ones, watching\u00a0the great ship sink while the steadfast band played \"Nearer, My God, to Thee,\" and floating helplessly for long hours on icy seas. The search for responsibility began amid the grief of widows and orphans aboard the rescue vessel Carpathia, with accusations of ignored warnings, reckless attempts at record-setting, and the woefully inadequate supply of lifeboats. Enhancing the text are drawings of the ship's decks and luxurious interiors, along with numerous rare photographs of celebrity passengers, captain and crew, poignant images of survivors huddled in lifeboats, and many more striking scenes. Readers will be spellbound by the gripping, you-are-there quality of this unique volume and its remarkable vision of one of the great maritime disasters of history.",

        "Description": "Among the most influential philosophers of modern times, Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) declared in this classic study that Greek tragedy achieved greatness through a fusion of elements of Apollonian restraint and control with Dionysian components of passion and the irrational. In Nietzsche's eyes, however, Greek tragedy had been destroyed by the rationalism and optimism of thinkers like Socrates. Nevertheless, he found in these ancient works the life-affirming concept that existence is still beautiful, however grim and depressing it may sometimes be. These and many other ideas are argued with passionate conviction in this challenging book, called by British classicist F. M. Cornford \"a work of profound imaginative insight, which left the scholarship of a generation toiling in the rear.\"",

        "Description": "\"When the word fable is mentioned,\" writes Jack Zipes in his foreword to this volume, \"one automatically thinks of the name Aesop, never Avianus.\" Nevertheless, the lively and instructive fables of this early fifth-century Roman writer enjoyed significant popularity in Europe throughout the Middle Ages. Now the complete work of Avianus - forty-two elegiac fables in all - has been rendered into contemporary English verse by acclaimed translator David Slavitt. The volume also features four new illustrations by the artist Neil Welliver.The fables of Avianus show a world in flux, a topsy-turvy world, in which humor and cunning constitute the only saving grace for humans - and, one might add, the poet. While remaining true to the Aesopic spirit of depicting scenes of survival of the fittest in a blunt and candid manner, Avianus is fond of hyperbole and the grotesque, and he skillfully employs his hexameters to bring about an ironic twist that often makes the reader question traditional assumptions. Writing at a time when the Roman world was being transformed by the rise of Christianity, Avianus appears to voice doubt about humankind's ability to deal with change.But Avianus's voice was not a voice of despair. Like Aesop, he shows a clear preference in his fables for learning how to survive and for the underdog. These and other parallels between Avianus's world and our own are all the more striking in the splendid verse translations of David Slavitt. Speaking as clearly to us as he did to his Roman contemporaries, Avianus is once again revealed as a shrewd poet who can unmask hypocrisy and overcome adversity every bit as well as his savvy master Aesop.",

        "Title": "The Myth of America's Decline: Leading the World Economy into the 1990s",
        "Authors": "By Nau, Henry R.",
        "Description": "How can America be in decline and yet win the Cold War in 1989 and the Persian Gulf war in 1991?  Because, as Henry R. Nau argues in this probing analysis of postwar policy, the Untied States, unlike the Soviet Union, shared power with its allies as it built a converging world community of political democracies and liberalized market. Today America leads that community as both the world's only military superpower and the one country Western governments trust to use military force for common objectives--a trust exemplified by the recent war in Kuwait.       A loss of relative power, Nau contends, is not troublesome if it leads to more convergent domestic values and institutions among countries.  Over a period of forty years, carefully chronicled in this book, the United States pursued political and economic policies that successfully nurtured Western democracies and integrated industrial economies.  Through open markets, America helped allies catch up; and through open societies, the industrial nations overcame ethnic and economic divisions and grew to trust one another more.  Although the United States lost relative economic power, it gained political friends and still remains, economically, the world's leader in absolute levels of productivity.       Nor, according to the data assembled in this study, has the United States lost its ability to compete in foreign markets.  The economic policies of the 1980s led to growth rates and manufacturing productivity increases that surpassed the boom years of American dominance from 1947-1967 and equaled or exceeded the performance of Germany and Japan in the latter part of the decade.       The threat to our future, Nau contends, does not come from trade competition with the allies.  It comes instead from domestic divisions that immobilize America's fiscal and domestic policies and prevent the country from taking the lead role in assisting the historic transformation underway in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and many developing countries.  Americans have to decide whether half of their federal budget outlays should continue to go to middle class entitlements, distributed without regard to need, or whether some of these savings--as well as defense cuts--should go to needy people both at home and in the reforming countries abroad.  Nau demonstrates that America can only live up to its high standards at home only if it recognizes that these standards are now widely recognized and accepted around the world.  To turn America's back on a world yearning to be free would not only weaken the prospects for success in the reforming countries but scuttle America's self-image and confidence at home.",

        "Description": "Unlike most slang dictionaries that list entries alphabetically, Slang takes on modern American English one topic at a time, from \"auctionese\" to \"computerese\", the drug trade and sports slang. Slang was originally published by Pocket Books in 1990 in paperback (ISBN 0671672517, out of print) and revised in 1998 in hardcover and paperback (ISBN 0671549200 and 0671549197; hc out of print soon after publication, pb in print until 2005). The new Slang has 50% new material, including new chapters on slang associated with work cubicles, gaming, hip hop, and coffeehouses. Dickson brings slang into the twenty-first century with such blogger slang as TMPMITW, which stands for \"the most powerful man in the world\" (the president).  Whether you want to be privy to the inside banter of the boardroom, backroom or the Washington Beltway, Slang is an indispensable resource, and a lot of fun. Slang is evidence that the spoken language is continually changing to meet new needs for verbal expressions, tailored to changing realities and perceptions.",

        "Description": "The perimenopausal years can start as early as age thirty-five and last for up to ten years. This transitional period in a woman's life has often been misdiagnosed or ignored. Now Stephanie Bender, an expert in women's hormonal health, sounds a wake-up call for the confusing years before menopause, which require special emotional, dietary, and health guidance.The Power of Perimenopause explains how symptoms such as irregular cycles, night sweats and insomnia, decreased libido, memory lapses, and mood swings can be traced to fluctuating hormones. It gives detailed recommendations on how to use both conventional and alternative approaches to lessen symptoms, including the most up-to-date research and new treatments. Bender also goes beyond medical advice to show women how all facets of their lives, from diet to attitude to lifestyle, can be transformed to make this an exciting and productive phase. Perimenopause is a time when women can reconsider their beliefs and priorities with newfound wisdom--perhaps discarding outmoded images of female beauty and examining their relationships with lovers and family on a deeper level. The Power of Perimenopause explores this neglected age with practical ways to enhance the quality of all areas of women's lives.From the Trade Paperback edition.",

While there are many current theories on organizational management and team productivity, there is a scarcity of wisdom to help each of us adapt and thrive as we ride the tumultuous wave of societal change.
