Only Alma Guillermoprieto, the most highly regarded writer on the region, could unravel the complex threads of Colombia\u2019s cocaine wars or assess the combination of despotism, charm, and political jiu-jitsu that has kept Fidel Castro in power for more than 40 years. And no one else can write with such acumen and sympathy about statesmen and campesinos, leftist revolutionaries and right-wing militias, and political figures from Evita Peron to Mexico\u2019s irrepressible president, Vicente Fox.  Whether she is following the historic papal visit to Havana or staying awake for a pre-dawn interview with an insomniac Subcomandante Marcos, Guillermoprieto displays both the passion and knowledge of an insider and the perspective of a seasoned analyst.  Looking for History is journalism in the finest traditions of Joan Didion, V. S. Naipaul, and Ryszard Kapucinski: observant, empathetic, and beautifully written.",

With information both practical (how to find the right running shoes for you, when to enter a race, what to eat before a run) and inspirational (focus on where you are instead of where you want to be, accepting the body you have, the beauty of being realistic about goals), Bingham extends a trusted hand and expert advice to beginners and veterans alike.",

        "Description": "A new edition of a classic, still considered one of the best books ever written for the older golfer looking to improve his or her game Sam Snead is one of the most remarkable athletes of this or any other era, a man whose skills and competitive instincts seem to be immune to the ravages of time.\u00a0\u00a0He is the perfect individual to explain how older golfers can get the most from their game. In Golf Begins At Forty, Snead advocates improving the strengths one already has, rather than trying to make radical changes in swing or overall technique.\u00a0\u00a0Using stories from his career to emphasize his points, Snead picks out specific problem areas (such as tension, attitude, loss of distance, reduced flexibility, and fatigue) that are affected by age, and demonstrates how to deal with them, providing new approaches for experienced players who think they have nothing more to learn.\u00a0\u00a0It is never too early to start developing certain swing habits and certain attitudes toward the game that will offset the problems to come, and it's much easier to start to adjust at forty-five than it is at fifty-five. This book offers simple and straightforward cures, but it also tells the older player how to better utilize those advantages he or she may have over the younger golfer, such as additional experience and, perhaps, additional time to play and practice. Each chapter begins with a wise and insightful anecdote from Snead's long career, which makes it not only more fun to read, but also easier to understand and remember.\u00a0\u00a0The text is complemented throughout with drawings by one of the world's leading golf illustrators, James McQueen.",

Impoverished but well-born, Lily realizes a secure future depends on her acquiring a wealthy husband. Her downfall begins with a romantic indiscretion, intensifies with an accumulation of gambling debts, and climaxes in a maelstrom of social disasters.More a tale of social exclusion than of failed love, The House of Mirth reveals Wharton's compelling gifts as a storyteller and her clear-eyed observations of the savagery beneath the well-bred surface of high society. As with The Age of Innocence and Ethan Frome, this novel was also made into a successful motion picture.",

Over six feet tall, clean cut, and college educated, he didn't pitch on the Sabbath and rarely spoke an ill word about anyone. He also had one of the most devastating arms in all of baseball. New York Giants manager John McGraw, by contrast, was ferocious. The pugnacious tough guy was already a star infielder who, with the Baltimore Orioles, helped develop a new, scrappy style of baseball, with plays like the hit-and-run, the Baltimore chop, and the squeeze play. When McGraw joined the Giants in 1902, the Giants were coming off their worst season ever. Yet within three years, Mathewson clinched New York City's first World Series for McGraw's team by throwing three straight shutouts in only six days, an incredible feat that is invariably called the greatest World Series performance ever. Because of their wonderful odd-couple association, baseball had its first superstar, the Giants ascended into legend, and baseball as a national pastime bloomed.",

Here are a pair of classic contemporary novels that prove once and for all that when it comes to love, you can\u2019t get too much of a good thing.Stormy VowsFor a struggling actress, a private audition with a young Hollywood turk like Michael Donovan was the break of a lifetime. But Brenna Sloan refused to be intimidated by the temperamental and sensually overwhelming filmmaker, even if it did cost her the role of a lifetime. For Brenna was both far stronger\u2014and far more vulnerable\u2014than Michael could ever guess. And the secret that she was keeping from him would draw them more intimately together with each encounter\u2026and threaten to drive them apart forever.Tempest at SeaAn idealist and activist, Jane Smith stole aboard Jake Dominic\u2019s yacht one warm Miami night as part of an antinuke protest. But in her earnestness Jane hadn\u2019t fully considered the consequences if she got caught or that her act of principled vandalism would end with her serving as Dominic\u2019s part-time prisoner and cabinmate. For the next two months she would accompany this successful, sexy but darkly brooding man aboard the Sea Breeze as they sailed around the Gulf of Mexico from one exotic port of call to another. Danger, close escapes, and erotic adventure await, but nothing can be more unexpected than their romantic destination.",

Michael writes about the hard-won perspective that helped him see challenges as opportunities. Instead of building walls around himself, he developed a personal policy of engagement and discovery: an emotional, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual outlook that has served him throughout his struggle with Parkinson's disease. Michael's exit from a very demanding, very public arena offered him the time-and the inspiration-to open up new doors leading to unexpected places. One door even led him to the center of his own family, the greatest destination of all. The last ten years, which is really the stuff of this book, began with such a loss: my retirement from Spin City. I found myself struggling with a strange new dynamic: the shifting of public and private personas. I had been Mike the actor, then Mike the actor with PD. Now was I just Mike with PD Parkinson's had consumed my career and, in a sense, had become my career. But where did all of this leave Me? I had to build a new life when I was already pretty happy with the old one.. Always Looking Up is a memoir of this last decade, told through the critical themes of Michael's life: work, politics, faith, and family. The book is a journey of self-discovery and reinvention, and a testament to the consolations that protect him from the ravages of Parkinson's. With the humor and wit that captivated fans of his first book, Lucky Man, Michael describes how he became a happier, more satisfied person by recognizing the gifts of everyday life.",

This book seeks to understand the terrible attacks of September 11th within a broader historical, political and ideological context. Rather than drawing on simple 'clash of civilisation' oppositions, the author argues that it is important to have an awareness of the complex historical processes which influence: America's sense of itself and its changing view of the world How the world, especially the Muslim world, views America The changing nature of international politics and the global system since the end of the cold war. Drawing on a wide range of contemporary and historical sources Richard Crockatt has written a balanced, subtle and highly readable book which provides genuine insight into American foreign policy, anti-Americanism and Islamic fundamentalism. It will be important reading for all those seeking to understand the background to the 'war on terror'.",

Governor Sarah Palin (R---Alaska) brings both of those qualities to her new role as candidate for the vice presidency of the United States.  Her familiarity with a broad range of issues and her strong moral center are just two of the leadership traits that have allowed Palin to organize and focus her efforts in elected office.  Exploring themes from her career in politics, her life as a hockey mom, and her strongly held Christian faith, author Joe Hilley's biographical leadership study of Sarah Palin explores the leadership principles that have catapulted her into the national spotlight and explains how she models a fresh paradigm of leadership that will guide our nation through the 21st century.",

        "Description": "\"The ideas in his book will help you see the world in a new way.\"-Bill Clinton\"Mark Penn has a keen mind and a fascinating sense of what makes America tick, and you see it on every page of Microtrends.\"-Bill GatesIn 1982, readers discovered Megatrends.In 2000, The Tipping Point entered the lexicon.Now, in Microtrends, one of the most respected and sought-after analysts in the world articulates a new way of understanding how we live.           Mark Penn, the man who identified \"Soccer Moms\" as a crucial constituency in President Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign, is known for his ability to detect relatively small patterns of behavior in our culture-microtrends that are wielding great influence on business, politics, and our personal lives. Only one percent of the public, or three million people, is enough to launch a business or social movement. Relying on some of the best data available, Penn identifies more than 70 microtrends in religion, leisure, politics, and family life that are changing the way we live. Among them:People are retiring but continuing to work.Teens are turning to knitting.Geeks are becoming the most sociable people around.Women are driving technology.Dads are older than ever and spending more time with their kids than in the past.  You have to look at and interpret data to know what's going on, and that conventional wisdom is almost always wrong and outdated. The nation is no longer a melting pot. We are a collection of communities with many individual tastes and lifestyles. Those who recognize these emerging groups will prosper.Penn shows readers how to identify the microtrends that can transform a business enterprise, tip an election, spark a movement, or change your life. In today's world, small groups can have the biggest impact.",

        "Description": "Greg Palast digs deep to unearth the ugly facts that few reporters working anywhere in the world today have the courage or ability to cover. From East Timor to Waco, Karachi to Santiago, he has exposed some of the most egregious cases of political corruption, corporate fraud, and financial manipulation, globally. His uncanny investigative skills as well as his acerbic wit and no-holds-barred style have made him an anathema among magnates on four continents and a living legend among his colleagues and his devoted readership, worldwide. This exciting new collection brings together some of Palast's most powerful and influential writing of the past decade. His columns in the Observer have a cult following and he made headline news when he went undercover for the Observer to break open the 'Lobbygate' scandal of corruption inside the Blair Cabinet. Included here are his reports on that story, which earned him the distinction of being the first journalist ever to be personally attacked on the floor of Parliament by a prime minister; his celebrated Washington Post expos\u00e9 on Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris's stealing of the presidential election in Florida, which made him \"a legend and a hero on the Internet\" (Alan Colmes / Fox Radio) when it ran in Salon.com; and recent stories on George W. Bush's pay-offs to corporate cronies, and the business-created 'energy crisis.'
