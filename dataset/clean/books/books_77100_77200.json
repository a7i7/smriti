        "Title": "Science: A History of Discovery in the Twentieth Century",
        "Authors": "By Williams, Trevor I. (EDT)",
        "Description": "As the twentieth century began, there were no airplanes, no radio stations, no mass-produced cars--even the zipper had yet to be invented.  Within a lifetime, scientists had unlocked some of nature's deepest secrets, leading to home computers, genetic engineering, landings on the moon, nuclear weapons, and Velcro.  For better or for worse, no other period in history has been so changed by the advance of science.      With over 300 informatively captioned photographs and 50 pieces of full-color artwork and maps, Science provides an intelligent, enjoyable, and comprehensive look at the history of scientific discovery in the twentieth century.  In a lively narrative, supplemented by maps, chronological tables, datafiles, and special features, a team of distinguished contributors examine the history of science, technology, the scientific community, and the role of government, the military, and industry in research and development.  Science unfolds the breathtaking advance of knowledge and techniques--showing how Einstein's \"thought experiments\" led to a whole new concept of the universe (and to atomic bombs), and tracing the evolution of television from an odd-looking apparatus that relied on a spinning disk with a spiral of holes to the fiber optic technology that allows surgeons to look inside tiny blood vessels.  It also covers the epic events of recent history that sparked sudden advances, such as World War II (which gave birth to radar, jets, advanced rockets, and atomic power) and the Space Race (leading to new knowledge of the solar system, weather and communication satellites, and Teflon).  The text offers up-to-the-minute coverage of topics like the space shuttle program and the fight against AIDS.  Special feature sections address such discoveries as the birth control pill, plate tectonics, and organ transplants, and capsule biographies discuss the lives of pivotal figures in twentieth century science.  And throughout, the discussion delves into the social context of science, looking at its funding, priorities, and how it has been used.      Lavishly illustrated, Science offers a useful and entertaining survey of the spectacular discoveries of the last century, relating the advances in science to the wider current of politics and culture.  Written to be thoroughly accessible to the general reader, it is both an excellent reference and an ideal tour of twentieth century science and technology.",

        "Title": "Upstream: The Ascendance of American Conservatism",
        "Authors": "By Regnery, Alfred S.",
        "Description": "Alfred S. Regnery, the publisher of The American Spectator, has been a part of the American conservative movement since childhood, when his father founded The Henry Regnery Company, which subsequently became Regnery Publishing -- the preeminent conservative publishing house that, among other notable achievements, published William F. Buckley's first book, God and Man at Yale. Including many uniquely personal anecdotes and stories, Regnery himself now boldly chronicles the development of the conservative movement from 1945 to the present.   The outpouring of grief at the funeral of Ronald Reagan in 2004 -- and the acknowledgment that Reagan has come to be considered one of the greatest presidents of the twentieth century -- is Regnery's opening for a fascinating insider story. Beginning at the start of the twentieth century, he shows how in the years prior to and just post World War II, expanding government power at home and the expanding Communist empire abroad inspired conservatives to band together to fight these threats. The founding of the National Review, the drive to nominate Barry Goldwater first as vice-president and later as president, the apparent defeat of the conservative movement at the hands of Lyndon Johnson, and the triumphant rise of Ronald Reagan from the ashes are all chronicled in vivid prose that shows a uniquely intimate knowledge of the key figures. Regnery shares his views on the opposition that formed in response to Earl Warren's Supreme Court rulings, the role of faith (both Roman Catholic and Evangelical) in the renewed vigor of conservatism, and the contributing role of American businessmen who attempted to oppose big government.   Upstream ultimately gives perspective to how the most vibrant political and cultural force of our time has influenced American culture, politics, economics, foreign policy, and all institutions and sectors of American life.",

        "Description": "Although Europe cannot yet challenge America in military terms, and though the Europeans themselves are still debating the structure and size that their union should assume, the EU already uses its vast economic and \"soft\" geopolitical power to influence world events. What does this reality imply for the United States?Ambassador Rockwell A. Schnabel and Francis X. Rocca take up this complex question in a detailed, firsthand analysis of the EU institutions, their leadership, and their interaction with the 25 member states. This book examines how the rise of Europe will affect U.S. prosperity and security for decades to come.Ambassador Schnabel dispenses with diplomatic niceties as he assesses the policies of both Brussels and Washington. Schnabel and Rocca offer an inside look at the people and issues that will decide whether the world's most consequential partnership flourishes or flounders. Alert to the economic and geopolitical challenges posed by a more assertive EU, the authors reject the complacency of those who see American \"unipolarity\" as a license to neglect our allies or who entertain the illusion that we can \"divide and conquer\" Europe. This book makes clear why the United States must work with the EU - or expect the EU to work against it.",

        "Title": "Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish",
        "Authors": "By Pogrebin, Abigail",
        "Description": "Sixty-two of the most accomplished Jews in America speak intimately\u2014most for the first time\u2014about how they feel about being Jewish. In unusually candid interviews conducted by former 60 Minutes producer Abigail Pogrebin, celebrities ranging from Sarah Jessica Parker to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, from Larry King to Mike Nichols, reveal how resonant, crucial or incidental being Jewish is in their lives. The connections they have to their Jewish heritage range from hours in synagogue to bagels and lox; but every person speaks to the weight and pride of their Jewish history, the burdens and pleasures of observance, the moments they\u2019ve felt most Jewish (or not). This book of vivid, personal conversations uncovers how being Jewish fits into a public life, and also how the author\u2019s evolving religious identity was changed by what she heard.Dustin Hoffman, Steven Spielberg, Gene Wilder, Joan Rivers, and Leonard Nimoy talk about their startling encounters with anti-Semitism. Kenneth Cole, Eliot Spitzer, and Ronald Perelman explore the challenges of intermarriage.Mike Wallace, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ruth Reichl express attitudes toward Israel that vary from unquestioning loyalty to complicated ambivalence. William Kristol scoffs at the notion that Jewish values are incompatible with Conservative politics.Alan Dershowitz, raised Orthodox, talks about why he gave up morning prayer. Shawn Green describes the pressure that comes with being baseball\u2019s Jewish star.Natalie Portman questions the ostentatious bat mitzvahs of her hometown.Tony Kushner explains how being Jewish prepared him for being gay. Leon Wieseltier throws down the gauntlet to Jews who haven\u2019t taken the trouble to study Judaism. These are just a few key moments from many poignant, often surprising, conversations with public figures whom most of us thought we already knew.\u201cWhen my mother got her nose job, she wanted me to get one, too. She said I would be happier.\u201d\u2014Dustin Hoffman\u201cIt\u2019s a heritage to be proud of. And then, too, it\u2019s something that you can\u2019t escape because the world won\u2019t let you; so it\u2019s a good thing you can be proud of it.\u201d \u2014Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u201cMy wife [Kate Capshaw] chose to do a full conversion before we were married in 1991, and she married me as a Jew. I think that, more than anything else, brought me back to Judaism.\u201d\u2014Steven Spielberg\u201cAs someone who was born in Israel, you\u2019re put in a position of defending Israel because you know how much is at stake.\u201d\u2014Natalie Portman\u201cJewish introspection and Jewish humor is a way of surviving . . . if you\u2019re not handsome and you\u2019re not athletic and you\u2019re not rich, there\u2019s still one last hope with girls, which is being funny.\u201d\u2014Mike Nichols\u201cI felt not only this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a better Jew.\u201d\u2014Ronald O. Perelman\u201cAmerican Jews, like Americans, have a very consumerist attitude toward their identity: they pick and choose the bits of this and that they like.\u201d\u2014Leon Wieseltier\u201cI thought if I had straight hair and a perfect nose, my whole career would be different.\u201d\u2014Sarah Jessica Parker\u201cI\u2019ve always rebelled a little when people say, \u2018My Jewish values lead me to really care about the poor.\u2019 I know some Christians who care about the poor, too.\u201d\u2014William Kristol\u201cThere were many times when I kept silent about being Jewish as I got older, when Jewish jokes were told.\u201d\u2014William Shatner\u201c\u2018Jew bastard\u2019 was something I heard a lot.\u201d\u2014Leonard Nimoy. \u201cI always liked shiksas.\u201d\u2014Larry King\u201cIt specifically says in the Torah that you can eat shrimp and bacon in a Chinese restaurant.\u201d\u2014Jason Alexander\u201cYom Kippur is something I do alone, with nobody else, because I believe that my relationship with God is mine and mine only.\u201d\u2014Diane von Furstenberg",

        "Authors": "By Bastianich, Lidia Matticchio",
        "Description": "Lidia Bastianich, loved by millions of Americans for her simple, delectable Italian cooking, gives   us her most instructive and personal cookbook yet. Focusing on the Italian-American   kitchen\u2014the cooking she encountered when she first came to America as a young adolescent\u2014Lidia pays homage to this \u201ccuisine of adaptation born of necessity.\u201d But she transforms   it subtly with her light, discriminating touch, using the authentic ingredients,   not accessible to the early immigrants, which are all so readily available today.   The aromatic flavors of fine Italian olive oil, imported Parmigiano-Reggiano and   Gorgonzola dolce latte, fresh basil, oregano, and rosemary, sun-sweetened San Marzano   tomatoes, prosciutto, and pancetta permeate the dishes she makes in her Italian-American   kitchen today. And they will transform for you this time-honored cuisine, as you   cook with Lidia, learning from her the many secret, sensuous touches that make her   food superlative.  You\u2019ll find recipes for Scampi alla Buonavia (the garlicky shrimp   that became so popular when Lidia served the dish at her first restaurant, Buonavia),   Clams Casino (with roasted peppers and good American bacon), Caesar Salad (shaved   Parmigiano makes the difference), baked cannelloni (with roasted pork and mortadella),   and lasagna (blanketed in her special Italian-American Meat Sauce). But just as   Lidia introduced new Italian regional dishes to her appreciative clientele in Queens   in the seventies, so she dazzles us now with pasta dishes such as Bucatini with Chanterelles,   Spring Peas, and Prosciutto, and Long Fusilli with Mussels, Saffron, and Zucchini.   And she is a master at teaching us how to make our own ravioli, featherlight gnocchi,   and genuine Neapolitan pizza.  Laced with stories about her experiences in America and her discoveries as a cook,   this enchanting book is both a pleasure to read and a joy to cook from.",

Arranged alphabetically, from Accident, Traffic to Zoology, Game Show Contestants\u2019 Knowledge of (and you wouldn\u2019t believe how distorted that knowledge sometimes is), The Lexicon of Stupidity is an overstuffed dictionary of quotes, banalities, actual book titles, holdup notes, menu items, TV listings, and more, each meeting one exacting criterion: they\u2019re so jaw-droppingly dumb you can\u2019t help but laugh. It\u2019s the wit of the witless. The comedy of the clueless. The giggly fun of celebrities, athletes, politicians, newscasters, and other pompous types planting a foot (or two) firmly in mouth. And no authors could be more qualified to pull it together than Ross and Kathryn Petras, whose calendar celebrating stupidity\u2014The 365 Stupidest Things Ever Said\u2014is a perennial knock-out, with millions of copies sold since its debut in 1995. It even includes real courtroom testimony: Q. Are you sexually active?  A. No, I just lie there.",

In clear, no-nonsense terms, Woods explains what led up to this economic crisis, who's really to blame, and why government bailouts won't work. Woods will reveal:* Which brave few economists predicted the economic fallout--and why nobody listened* What really caused the collapse* Why the Fed--not taxpayers--should have to answer for the current economic crisis* Why bailouts are band-aids that will only provide temporary relief and ultimately make things worse* What we should do instead, to put our economy on a healthy path to recoveryWith a foreword from Ron Paul, Meltdown is the free-market answer to the Fed-created economic crisis. As the new Obama administration inevitably calls for more regulations, Woods argues that the only way to rebuild our economy is by returning to the fundamentals of capitalism and letting the free market work",

He has stumbled forward and backward through time. He has been blown up, reassembled, cruelly imprisoned, horribly released, and colorfully insulted more than is strictly necessary. And of course Arthur Dent has comprehensively failed to grasp the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.Arthur has finally made it home to Earth, but that does not mean he has escaped his fate.Arthur's chances of getting his hands on a decent cuppa have evaporated rapidly, along with all the world's oceans. For no sooner has he touched down on the planet Earth than he finds out that it is about to be blown up . . . again.And Another Thing . . . is the rather unexpected, but very welcome, sixth installment of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. It features a pantheon of unemployed gods, everyone's favorite renegade Galactic President, a lovestruck green alien, an irritating computer, and at least one very large slab of cheese.",

        "Authors": "By Steiner, George A.",
        "Description": "In today's complex world of business, strategic planning is indispensable to effective management. Ever since the mid-1950's, when American companies began to develop formal long-range planning systems, wise managers have understood the importance of knowing where their firm was headed and how it intended to get there. To function effectively in a modern, planned operation, every manager must have a practical understanding of how the planning process works.  That's exactly what this book offers: a step-by-step guide to strategic planning. George A. Steiner, a well-known expert in the field of management, provides a concise, jargon-free handbook that avoids abstract theory and takes you straight to the \"how-to\" of planning. Whether you're designing and implementing a new plan or working with a plan that's already in operation, Strategic Planning puts the information you need at your fingertips.  It takes you through every stage of the process, from idea to execution to evaluation. (And explains \"Fifty Common Pitfalls\" you'll need to know about.) You can plug your own data into the lucid charts, tables, and checklists for a valuable start on getting organized and evaluating your planning needs. And there's plenty of penetrating discussion about the questions and quandaries you're likely to meet along the way. For example:  * How do you identify, evaluate, and implement strategies? * How do you design a planning system to fit the unique characteristics of you and your company? * Can an intuitive manager do formal strategic planning? * What are some ways to develop clear objectives? * What human behavior factors can endanger planning and how can managers overcome them? * How, and when, should a situation audit be made? * What do you need to know about computer models? * How can business planning lessons be applied to not-for-profit organizations? * How can managers apply lessons of planning experience to the planning of their own careers?  You don't have to get an advanced degree to make strategic planning a part of your management style. All you need is the expert advice in this idea-packed handbook.
