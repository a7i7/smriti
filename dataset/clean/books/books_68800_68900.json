James's partner of eight years, Kate Bain, appears devoted, though she will not marry him. Hugh's perfect wife, Julia, runs him, her career, their house, and their twins like clockwork. The men and the girls seem wonderfully suited.But the age difference is a time bomb ticking away at the heart of both relationships. The first signs of difficulty coincide with the appearance of an older and fiercely independent woman who unintentionally fuels the discontent already brewing in both girls. Kate's suppressed hunger for a life more natural to her age suddenly boils over; Julia, meanwhile, has to cope with her own blossoming career while watching Hugh's wither before their eyes.With warmth and wisdom, plus the acerbic sense of humor for which the English are so well known, Trollope takes a long hard look at the gaps between generations, and how very much we can learn from them.",

Sometimes there is nothing left but to run away, to run for freedom. And that is what Erin and two friends do, run away one night downriver on a raft. What they find on their journey is stranger than you can imagine, maybe, and you might not think it's true. But Erin will tell you it is all true.

The 8 Beatitudes?If you're not sure about the answers to the above, this is the book for you. A compendium of 101 culturally significant particulars from the fields of mythology, religion, literature, history, science, mathematics, art, and music,What Are the 7 Wonders of the World? is a stimulating fusion of facts and fun that makes for an invaluable reference and an entertaining diversion.Questions are grouped in sections according to the number of items in their answer (all the 3s, all the 4s, all the 5s, etc.), so that the answers are in the form of easily memorized lists. You won't find Luther's 95 theses, or the 264 Popes, for example, but you will find everything from the 3 sons of Adam and Eve all the way up to the 24 letters of the ancient Greek alphabet.This clever format lends itself well to quizzing and guessing, which gives it a deliciously sophisticated parlor-game quality. But for those who wish to delve a little deeper, there are thoughtful essays to go with each answer that include fascinating details and place the list in its larger cultural or historical context. Much more than a book of trivia,What Are the 7 Wonders of the World? offers a grand overview of the knowledge needed to appreciate many of the finest things in our cultural and intellectual life.",

        "Description": "As president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn managed operations in almost 150 countries and was responsible for tens of billions of dollars in aid to the world's poorest nations. During his ten years and visits to more than 120 countries, Wolfensohn tirelessly drew the world's attention to the need to provide hope and a better future for the world's poor. He transformed the World Bank, made it more open and transparent, and integrated the views of the poor into development planning. He also changed the face and the character of an institution that was previously seen by many as heartless and arrogant. By describing the challenge of development in terms of people, and not only numbers, Wolfensohn put the spotlight back on the World Bank's real purpose\u2014fighting global poverty and helping the world's poor forge a better life.'Voice for the World's Poor' brings together the most important and inspiring speeches and writings by James Wolfensohn during his time as World Bank president. Spanning all ten years of his presidency (1995-2005), the book presents Wolfensohn's most stimulating and thought-provoking ideas on critical global issues including poverty, debt relief, corruption, HIV/AIDS, climate change, human rights, and globalization. Written during some of the most tumultuous times in recent history, Wolfensohn addresses and examines key global events and issues, from Bosnia's reconstruction, the Asian financial crisis, and the rise of the antiglobalization movement to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the aftermath of the Iraq war, and the outpouring of help for the victims of the tsunami of December, 2004.Over 100 speeches, essays, and letters chart Wolfensohn's thinking on development and his emergence as an advocate and voice for the world's poor. This book will be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in international relations, international development, the World Bank, and James Wolfensohn himself.",

Furthermore, only this book accurately describes the severity of the threat they will continue to pose, with or without bin Laden\u2019s leadership, to our national security.To win the war against terrorism, the author argues that we must first stop dismissing militant Muslims as \u201cextremists\u201d or \u201creligious fanatics.\u201d Formulating a successful military strategy requires that we must see the enemy as they perceive themselves\u2014highly trained and motivated soldiers who fervently believe their cause is righteous. The author describes how militants throughout the Islamic world are enraged by what they believe is Western aggression against their people, religion, and culture. Though bin Laden declared war on America years ago\u2014not once but twice\u2014the author argues that American complacence in the face of such violent threats stems from the increasing secularization and moral relativism of American society and culture. Even if bin Laden is brought to justice, the author warns, the dangers posed by radical Islamic militants will not disappear, and we must be prepared for a protracted war against terrorism. This important book will make a major impact on how America thinks about its enemy and itself.",

Twice wed and twice widowed, Antonia has vowed never again to marry; never again to surrender her freedom. But when her husband's death is deemed suspicious, and his long-lost heir returns to seize control of the dukedom, she finds that fate has placed her future in yet another man's hands -- but not just any man.   They call him a cold-hearted bastard...    Deep in London's docklands, Gareth Lloyd runs Neville Shipping with an iron fist. Unrecognizable as the starving orphan who was abandoned by his family and sent an ocean away from home, Gareth has put his troubled past behind him. That is, until the Duke of Warneham is murdered, and Gareth turns out to be the dynasty's last living heir. Wrenched from his solitude, Gareth neither wants nor needs the honors and obligations of nobility -- especially the Duke's all-too-tempting widow.... Or does he?",

In that difficult place, we long for a tangible, visible sign that God hears our cries and is actively working for good in our lives. But all too often, faulty thinking erodes our faith and alters our beliefs, causing us to ask;If He loves me so much, why do I hurt so much?Am I being punished? I thought I was forgiven.Why is faith so hard? What if I don't have enough?Why does God allow suffering?In God at Your Wits' End, Marilyn Meberg helps us cut through the mental clutter and confusion that lead to faulty thinking and shaky faith. She tenderly acknowledges our trials by revealing her own wits'-end experiences; then she points the way to rescue and respite by sharing the scriptural truths of God's enduring love and sovereign power.",

An affectionate homage to the classic English detective story, LONDON BRIDGES is set in 1990s London and crafted with a very modern spin. Its plot centers on a treasure lost in the Blitz and newly discovered by an unscrupulous lawyer, who is tempted by greed into a series of crimes leading to murder. A highly contemporary cast of characters assembles to confound him, including a charming and flamboyant gay classicist in hot pursuit of a sixth-century homoerotic poem he hopes will revive his flagging career, a young Indian lawyer fighting British prejudices of race and class, and a very nice dog named Alice. The main character, lovingly depicted, is London itself, in all its rich variousness. Among the novel's themes are the rewards of friendship and community. the imperatives of both preservation and change, and the intertwining, with unexpected effects, of lives in a great city.A lighthearted work shadowed by moments of genuine pathos, LONDON BRIDGES is wonderfully entertaining. It will captivate readers with its high-spirited, stylish storytelling and playful scholarship.",

Portraying Donna Martin on Beverly Hills, 90210, Tori Spelling became one of the most recognizable young actresses of her generation, with a not-so-private personal life every bit as fascinating as her character's exploits. Yet years later the name Tori Spelling too often closed -- and sometimes slammed -- the same doors it had opened.  sTORI telling is Tori's chance to finally tell her side of the tabloid-worthy life she's led, and she talks about it all: her decadent childhood birthday parties, her nose job, her fairy-tale wedding to the wrong man, her so-called feud with her mother. Tori has already revealed her flair for brilliant, self-effacing satire on her VH1 show So NoTORIous and Oxygen's Tori & Dean: Inn Love, but her memoir goes deeper, into the real life behind the rumors: her complicated relationship with her parents; her struggles as an actress after 90210; her accident-prone love life; and, ultimately, her quest to define herself on her own terms.  From her over-the-top first wedding to finding new love to her much-publicized -- and misunderstood -- \"disinheritance,\" sTORI telling is a juicy, eye-opening, enthralling look at what it really means to be Tori Spelling.",

How will your ten-year-old respond to the news that her parents are divorcing? What does it mean that your eight-year-old seems to lie regularly?    By describing the developmental milestones of childhood, discussing specific questions and concerns and examining more troublesome problems, this invaluable book is designed to provide guidance for your day-to-day interactions with your child. It covers a range of practical issues, from choosing your baby&#39;s doctor to dealing with sleep problems, from bolstering a child&#39;s self-esteem to helping a child manage school difficulties, from selecting age-appropriate toys to helping your child cope with divorce, death, or other circumstances disrupting family life.  Your Child also moves beyond the day-to-day quandaries and concerns to those that represent more serious obstacles to a child&#39;s development and family life. The latter sections of the book provide extensive discussion of  the developmental problems that usually require professional intervention, including emotional disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, persistent sleep difficulties, and psychotic disorders. The information provided in these sections will help you to recognize and understand these serious disorders and offers practical advice and useful information to guide you through the who, where, when, and why of getting help for your child.   Written by members of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the leading national association of physicians dedicated to the healthy mental development of  children and adolescents, Your Child is the only reference to offer comprehensive and accessible information for parents on the emotional, behavioral, and cognitive development of children from infancy through the preadolescent years.

        "Title": "African Women: Three Generations",
        "Authors": "By Mathabane, Mark",
        "Description": "In African Women, the author of the highly acclaimed and best-selling memoir Kaffir Boy tells the deeply moving, often shocking, but ultimately inspiring stories of his grandmother, mother, and sister. Coping with abuse, gambling, drunkenness, and infidelity from the men they love or have been forced to marry, all three women defy African tradition, and the poverty and violence of life in a modern urban society, to make fulfilling lives for themselves and those they love in the belly of the apartheid beast in South Africa.Granny is sold to her future husband in their homeland - he pays the traditional bride price, lobola, agreed upon by their two families - and after fathering her three children, he deserts her for another woman. When Granny's daughter Geli comes of age, it's not surprising that Granny forces her to marry an older man, Jackson Mathabane, who might be less likely to desert a young wife.The marriage of Geli and Jackson is fraught with drama from the very beginning. Geli and her still-to-be-born first child (the author) are almost victims of witchcraft, saved at the last moment by a relative who discovers the perpetrator and rescues both mother and child. Jackson drinks and gambles, takes a mistress, beats his wife, and when Geli flees with the children to her aunt's house, demands all of them - his property - back with righteous indignation and the weight of African tribal tradition on his side.Mathabane's sister Florah is swept up in the student rebellion against apartheid in the mid-1970s, which left hundreds of young blacks dead. Much later, a single mother looking for love and protection in the dangerous world of Alexandra, a black ghetto of Johannesburg, Florah falls in love with a notorious gangster who proves to be more than she can handle.The stories of Florah, Geli, and Granny are told in their own words in alternating chapters that demonstrate how similar are the problems faced by each generation: all three women discover the need for an independent income in order to care for themselves and for their children; all three are the victims of the traditional assumption that women are property, commodities bought and sold by men; all three suffer from the terrible hardship imposed not only on women but also on black men by the system of apartheid in South Africa.But what stays with the reader of this family saga is the indomitable spirit of these three women - their honesty, faith, and even hopefulness in the face of the intolerable conditions under which they live. African Women is a passionate narrative, as inspiring as it is horrifying, a woman's story for our time. What is most surprising perhaps, and gratifying, is that the stories of Granny, Geli, and Florah are brought to life by the pen of a man, the generously gifted and enormously sympathetic Mark Mathabane.",

Lowell Hart starts readers off on familiar terrain -- in the living room -- where they practice key movements, the foundation of good riding at all skill levels. These are the moves that let riders tilt the board from front to back edge and carve the turns that only snowboards can scribe.From key moves Hart guides readers through first descents, stopping, first turns, connecting turns, side-slips, and garlands, all the while interjecting tips and predicting trouble spots before they trip up beginners. Then it's on to intermediate, advanced, and freestyle riding: basic halfpipe technique, terrain park tips, airborne spin tricks, rail slides, and even backcountry 'boarding.",

        "Description": "A novel of one of the most treacherous river expeditions ever undertaken, THE LAST CANYON takes us deep into the heart of the elements, portraying in vivid detail the human quest to understand nature at all costs. In 1869 a one-armed Civil War hero named John Wesley Powell launched four boats on the Green River in Wyoming Territory, undertaking what would be the last major voyage of discovery in American history, through the country's only remaining terra incognita: the remote and barren course of the Colorado River.At the outset of his journey, Powell believed the inaccessible canyons of the Colorado were uninhabited. He was wrong. What he called \"the great unknown\" was in fact well known by a band of Paiute Indians who had lived on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon for centuries. In John Vernon's hands, the story of Powell's voyage of exploration is two converging stories: that of Powell and his crew, and that of a family of Paiute making their own harrowing circuit of the Grand Canyon in an attempt to rescue a kidnapped girl. Told in alternating chapters, THE LAST CANYON deftly leads us into perilous geographical and emotional territory, culminating in Powell's struggle to finish his voyage with only two boats, not four, and five men out of the original nine.Powell's adventure is a story of triumph, hardship, bravery, and ultimate tragedy. THE LAST CANYON traces simultaneously a voyage of discovery and a chronicle of loss, an exploration of both unknown land and the unplumbed human spirit.",
