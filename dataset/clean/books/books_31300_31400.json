        "Title": "China: A New History",
        "Authors": "By Fairbank, John King",
        "Description": "Recognized for decades as the West's doyen on China, John King Fairbank here offers the full and final expression of his lifelong engagement with this vast, ancient civilization. Fairbank's masterwork, China: A New History is without parallel as a concise, comprehensive, and authoritative account of China and its people over four millennia.Bringing to bear sixty years of research, travel, and teaching, Fairbank weaves a richly detailed history that reaches from China's neolithic days to its troubled present. With a deft hand, he depicts a country ever-changing and yet constant in its effort to achieve a cohesive identity, an enormous and enormously complex nation perpetually balancing between the imperatives of force and the power of ideas. Here are the Chinese autocrats in their various times and guises, maintaining Confucian civility and order through--paradoxically--the perpetual threat of irrational imperial violence. Here is the intellectual class, revered for its wisdom and counsel and yet--as events from the Cultural Revolution to the massacre in Tiananmen Square demonstrate--eminently expendable. And here are China's farmers engaged in a never-ending, backbreaking attempt to tame their temperamental countryside only to face repeated famine as China's agrarian-based economy fails to develop. At the center of all stands the Chinese family, until recently the model for both obedience and tyranny in society at large.Fairbank traces the growth of a civilization that could embrace so many contradictions and disruptions and yet retain a strong sense of its identity. Following China's ambivalent relations with the West and with the forces of modernization, he identifies, even in the great leap forward signaled by the Communist Revolution, the assumptions that have informed Chinese society for thousands of years.From the influences of Buddhism through the flowering of Song China to the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, this richly illustrated history unfolds in the wise yet often unconventional style that is quintessentially Fairbank: informal, witty, magisterial, and clear. Informed by the most recent scholarly research, this delicately nuanced and broadly interpretive introduction to the Chinese people and their past will enlighten both the novice and the seasoned China-watcher.",

        "Description": "On a beautiful June day in 1965, a dozen girls-classmates at a picturesque Blue Ridge women's college-launched their homemade raft (inspired by Huck Finn's) on a trip down the Mississippi. It's Girls A-Go-Go Down the Mississippi read the headline in the Paducah, Kentucky, paper.Thirty-five years later, four of those \"girls\" reunite to cruise the river again. This time it's on the luxury steamboat, The Belle of Natchez, and there's no publicity. This time, when they reach New Orleans, they'll give the river the ashes of a fifth rafter-beautiful Margaret (\"Baby\") Ballou.Revered for her powerful female characters, here Lee Smith tells a brilliantly authoritative story of how college pals who grew up in an era when they were still called \"girls\" have negotiated life as \"women.\" Harriet Holding is a hesitant teacher who has never married (she can't explain why, even to herself). Courtney Gray struggles to step away from her Southern Living-style life. Catherine Wilson, a sculptor, is suffocating in her happy third marriage. Anna Todd is a world-famous romance novelist escaping her own tragedies through her fiction. And finally there is Baby, the girl they come to bury-along with their memories of her rebellions and betrayals.THE LAST GIRLS is wonderful reading. It's also wonderfully revealing of women's lives-of the idea of romance, of the relevance of past to present, of memory and desire.",

After she learns that her father has remarried and bought his dim-witted son's way into Yale, she politely suggests on her personal blog that Baby Boomers be given government incentives to kill themselves by age seventy-five.This modest proposal catches fire with millions of outraged citizens and an ambitious senator seeking the youth vote for his presidential bid. With the help of Washington's greatest PR strategist, Cassandra and the politician try to ride the issue of euthanasia for Boomers (they call it \"Transitioning\") all the way to the White House. Their opposition includes the president of the United States, who's running for reelection; a pro-life preacher, who may have killed his own mother in a mysterious automobile accident; and, of course, multitudes of Baby Boomers, who are deeply offended by demonstrations on the golf courses of their retirement resorts.",

        "Description": "In the two years since The Firm first captured the imagination of America's readers, John Grisham, with three consecutive number-one bestsellers, has become one of the most popular authors of our time. Now, in The Client, he has written a novel so irresistible, so thoroughly entertaining and satisfying, that it is sure not only to please his millions of fans, but to win him new ones as well.This is the story of eleven-year-old Mark Sway, who, as the novel opens, witnesses the bizarre suicide of a New Orleans attorney. Just before he dies, the lawyer tells Mark a deadly secret concerning the recent murder of a Louisiana Senator, whose accused killer, Mafia thug Barry Muldanno, is about to go to trial. The police, the federal prosecutor and the FBI pressure Mark to tell them the attorney's last words, but he knows that with the mob watching his every move, revealing his secret will almost surely get him killed.So Mark, streetwise and old beyond his years, hires a lawyer: Reggie Love, a fifty-two-year-old divorcee who's been through more than anyone could imagine and survived, basically, because she's tough. And feisty. And loves helping kids overlooked or abused by the system. But when Mark's life is threatened, and Reggie discovers her office has been bugged, and even the Juvenile Court judge says Mark has no choice but to talk, she realizes that this time she's in way over her head. But then Mark comes up with a plan... a crazy plan, in Reggie's opinion, but it's their only hope. And it just might work.With the page-turning suspense and terrific plot twists that have become John Grisham's trademark, he has once again crafted a novel that simply cannot be put down. But in The Client Grisham has gone a step further - with a cast of unforgettable characters headed by the most original hero in years, he has mixed equal parts humor and warmth to truly expand the boundaries of the legal thriller.",

The novel is told through the eyes of Henry Fleming, a young soldier caught up in an unnamed Civil War battle who is motivated not by the unselfish heroism of conventional war stories, but by fear, cowardice, and finally, egotism. However, in his struggle to find reality amid the nightmarish chaos of war, the young soldier also discovers courage, humility, and perhaps, wisdom. Although Crane had never been in battle before writing The Red Badge of Courage, the book was widely praised by experienced soldiers for its uncanny re-creation of the sights, sounds, and sense of actual combat. Its publication brought Crane immediate international fame and established him as a major American writer. Today, nearly a century later, the book ranks as an enduring landmark of American fiction.",

Was Marilyn Monroe...fat?These philosophical quandaries, and more, are finally debated in I'm with Stupid, an uproariously funny dialogue between Gene Weingarten, the gleefully misogynistic Washington Post humor columnist, and Gina Barreca, the gleefully feminist University of Connecticut professor.The first significant book about men and women actually written by a man and a woman, I'm with Stupid is privy to the dark secrets of both sexes. It's not a lecture, but an extended argument, a combustion of viewpoints that winds up unearthing startling truths. In the words of Gene and Gina: \"Our Mars and Venus breach their orbits and collide in a screaming fireball from Hell.\"The subject matter spans art and expression, science and technology, politics and history, spirituality and religion, sex and sexuality, as well as the complex etiology, sociology, and etymology of dirty jokes. Men: Learn at last how to know for sure when you are having a fight. Women: Learn what he really means when he says \"I'm sorry.\" Take sides as Gene and Gina face off in a haggling challenge in which the winner manages to get the lowest price for a Mercedes S500. Or just take in the show.I'm with Stupid is the book that finally establishes, conclusively, that women are funnier than men. And vice versa.",

Why? Because, these days, few business agreements, research grants, or government contracts are even considered without \"putting it in writing\" first. And you don't just want to be considered. You want to win.Persuasive Business Proposals provides a step-by-step process to help you organize, write, and deliver successful client proposals easily and inexpensively. Tom Sant's simple method will enable you to win contracts, sell projects, gain approval for new ideas, and build better relationships with the clients you already have. You'll learn how to use persuasion to great effect; organize your material and develop the proposal strategy; ensure every proposal is client-centered; create letter, formal, research, and grant proposals; and use automation to save time.Persuasive Business Proposals explains how to target key decisionmakers with language that is clear, effective, and credible. The book provides special writing suggestions, emphasizing word choice and sentence structure. You'll find numerous case studies and sample proposals from the author's work as a corporate writing consultant, which illustrate his advice and techniques. You'll even find a \"proposal writer's checklist\" to use to ensure that your proposal leaves nothing out.No business asset is more valuable than the ability to present your ideas clearly, effectively, and persuasively. \"A good proposal can be both useful to you and to your potential client,\" says the author. \"How useful it is depends on how carefully it's been designed, developed, and written. If you write a good proposal, you may win more than just a specific contract. You may win good will, respect, and credibility that will carry over into future business relations.\"",

That was before she left the pop-idol life behind after she gained a dress size or two -- and lost a boyfriend, a recording contract, and her life savings (when Mom took the money and ran off to Argentina). Now that the glamour and glory days of endless mall appearances are in the past, Heather's perfectly happy with her new size 12 shape (the average for the American woman!) and her new job as an assistant dorm director at one of New York's top colleges. That is, until the dead body of a female student from Heather's residence hall is discovered at the bottom of an elevator shaft.The cops and the college president are ready to chalk the death off as an accident, the result of reckless youthful mischief. But Heather knows teenage girls . . . and girls do not elevator surf. Yet no one wants to listen -- not the police, her colleagues, or the P.I. who owns the brownstone where she lives -- even when more students start turning up dead in equally ordinary and subtly sinister ways. So Heather makes the decision to take on yet another new career: as spunky girl detective!But her new job comes with few benefits, no cheering crowds, and lots of liabilities, some of them potentially fatal. And nothing ticks off a killer more than a portly ex-pop star who's sticking her nose where it doesn't belong . . .",

        "Description": "\"I know how to do anything--I'm a mom.\"--Roseanne BarrThanks, Mom! From pregnancy and giving birth to raising a child: motherhood is among the most profound, life-changing experiences a woman can have. Celebrities, both male and female, pay tribute to their mothers' warmth, wisdom, humor, and strength; some even hold forth on the ticklish subject of the mother-in-law. Many women also share their own feelings and knowledge, offering a cradleful of advice on the seemingly endless quandary of how to balance career and family. From Lady Bird Johnson: \"Children are likely to live up to what you believe of them.\" Ralph Waldo Emerson amusingly notes, \"There never was a child so lovely but his mother was glad to get him asleep.\"  It's a valentine to all the women who take on this loving, lifelong role.",

Developed in the early twentieth century by accomplished boxer and gymnast Joseph Pilates, the Pilates Method aligns the body; builds long, lean muscles; and develops core abdominal strength. Many lifestyle and fitness magazines have named Pilates the hottest workout of the decade. In a first-of-its-kind fusion, Pilates on the Ball merges the principles and exercises of the highly effective Pilates Method of body conditioning with the unique functions of the exercise ball, used by Olympic coaches, dancers, and athletes to fine-tune body awareness and enhance physical performance. The ball magnifies the benefits of the carefully developed and refined Pilates Method. Because maintaining balance on the ball recruits the deep, stabilizing muscles of the spine, the postural muscles are strengthened. The ball intensifies athletic performance by increasing resistance and heightening awareness of how the body moves in space. Chapters detail the Pilates principles step by step, with successive movements to challenge all levels of ability and \"watch points\" for careful evaluation of your form. Intense enough to engage seasoned athletes yet accessible enough to use as an everyday exercise routine or to alleviate chronic pain, Pilates on the Ball builds strong bodies and engaged minds.",

Dramatic accounts of these papal bad boys include: Urban VI, the wild man from Naples, whose grotesque savageries widened and maintained the scandalous gap of the Great Schism; Alexander VI, who brought to the See of Peter the intrigues of the Borgia; and Clement VII, the unskillful fox, whose fall brought down Rome itself. Profusely illustrated with architectural photographs and contemporary art from both Catholic and Protestant sources, this absorbing work vividly depicts the ecclesiastical corruptions which changed the course of history.",

In fact, they are essential for our mental and physical health as well as for developing healthy relationships. Yet every day, people's boundaries are violated by friends, family, or coworkers. Despite the importance of personal boundaries many people are unaware of how or when these very important lines are crossed.  Which of the following are boundary violations? Esther tells Betty a secret Mary told her. Your therapist invites you to go for coffee. Your boss wants to know the details of your personal life. Your boss asks you if you'd like a hug. Mom tells little Debbie about her troubles with Dad. Your new neighbor pats you on the bottom as he turns away. Your mother makes a comment about your being overweight.  All but one of the above incidents violate boundaries (your boss asks you if you'd like a hug). In Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin, Anne Katherine explains what healthy boundaries are, how to recognize if your personal boundaries are being violated, and what you can do to protect yourself.  For anyone who has walked away from a conversation, a meeting, or a visit with others feeling violated and not understanding why, this is a book that can help.",

The \"Story of the Physician and the Saratoga Trunk\" reveals the grim contents of a large piece of luggage that travels hundreds of miles to its final destination; and in \"The Adventure of the Hansom Cab,\" a bloody resolution seals the fate of a notorious and elusive assassin.Brimming with heart-stopping drama, this rare, lesser-known work by a master storyteller will appeal to a wide circle of readers, including fans of the great 19th-century English writer as well as lovers of a good mystery story.",

Both structurally and psychologically compact, it is among the most expressive of the Russian playwright's dramatic works.Set on an estate in nineteenth-century Russia, this deeply emotional tale of misplaced idealism and unrequited love concerns the complex interrelationships between a retired professor, his second wife, and his brother-in-law and daughter from a previous marriage. In deceptively mundane dialogue, the characters reveal their private tragedies \u2014 weakness and inability to communicate \u2014 the failures that lead them to lives of frustration and despair. Nevertheless, Chekhov's delineation of human frailties elicits sympathy for even the most irresolute and deluded characters, and the play's underlying message is one of courage and hope.Essential reading for any course in modern theater, this absorbing play continues to be popular. Students, theatergoers, and all lovers of great drama will appreciate this inexpensive edition of a masterpiece.",
