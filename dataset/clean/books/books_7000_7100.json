        "Description": "It's \"Corpse ahoy!\" when death takes a pleasure cruise -- as we set sail once more with that incomparable, crime-solving duo, the Darlings.Annie Darling, popular proprietress of the Death on Demand bookstore, has done it again! Her murder-mystery cruise in the waters off her not-always-idyllic isle of Broward's Rock is sure to be a roaring success, with every participant dressing up as a favorite fictional sleuth. And sure enough, everything goes swimmingly -- until one of the revelers plunges overboard. And despite hubby Max Darling's courageous rescue attempt, faux murder turns all too quickly into real-life death.  Over the next few days, the body count rises and Annie strongly suspects that all the victims were murdered most foully and that they are all connected in some unknown way. The trick now will be to prove it, with the able assistance of investigator-spouse Max, best friend and best customer Henny Brawley, local bestselling superstar Emma Lloyd, and even (surprise!) Annie's normally ditsy mother-in-law, Laurel.But what the intrepid crime solvers do not realize is that the killer they seek is more ingeniously efficient than most -- and the puzzle they wish to solve is, in reality, a time bomb packed with an explosive mix of arson, assault, kidnapping, robbery . . . and homicide, of course. One false step and Annie and her canny cohorts will be blown off Broward's Rock for good . . . and they'll sink like stones into the cold, briny deep.",

        "Description": "How much do we actually know about that most familiar of political figures, Senator Bob Dole? In this remarkable biography, Stanley Hilton paints a disturbing portrait. Using his personal experiences as an aide to the senator and his insights as a lawyer and teacher, Hilton offers a number of surprising revelations, including: Dole's brokering for power and catering to a host of special-interest groups (most notably, his becoming a major tobacco industry batboy); his numerous violations of election financing laws; the senator's career-long habit of flip-flopping on virtually every major national issue (including his positions on Israel, Saddam Hussein, and affirmative action); his role as the architect of the two largest tax hikes in U.S. history; and Dole's link with David Owen, a former top aide, who served time in a federal prison.In this chilling portrait, Hilton exposes Dole's colossal political money machine, which generates contributions amounting to almost $500,000 a week. Senator for Sale compares Senator Dole to his role model and hero Richard Nixon, and traces the senator's career from his origins in Kansas to Capitol Hill. Finally, while celebrating Dole's acknowledged wit and intelligence, Senator for Sale speculates on what a Dole presidency would be like.",

        "Title": "Guts: The Seven Laws of Business That Made Chrysler the World's Hottest Car Company",
        "Authors": "By Lutz, Robert A.",
        "Description": "In May 7, 1998 Chrysler Corporation and Germany's Daimler-Benz (owner of Mercedes) shocked the business world by announcing their intention to merge. What led to this largest industrial merger of all time? How did Chrysler\u2014which not too long ago needed government-backed loans in order to survive\u2014transform itself into not just a partner coveted by Daimler (the gold standard of European car makers) but the most profitable car company in the world? And what does their mega-merger portend for consumers, governments, shareholders and workers around the world In Guts, Robert A. Lutz, the product-development genius and iconoclastic leader behind Chrysler's second renaissance, answers these questions and many, many more. With wit and a surprising frankness, Lutz tells how Chrysler in the early '90s recovered from a second near-death experience to go on and post record profits, emerging as Forbes magazine's \"Company of the Year.\" He credits this remarkable turnaround to Chrysler's having embraced (at his urging) a deliberately \"schizophrenic\" corporate culture: tough, buttoned-down financial controls coupled with a rock-the-boat, provocative, highly creative product development process. The marriage of these two gave birth to a large family of hit products, starting with the radical, hugely popular Dodge Viper sports car, whose creation Lutz here describes. Along the way, he propounds what he humorously calls \"Lutz's Immutable Laws of Business\"\u2014seven controversial maxims meant to stand conventional business wisdom on its ear Guts explains how and why every organization must cultivate a \"split personality\" combining common sense with freewheeling creativity. It defines the leader's role in maintaining a healthy balance between the two. And it argues that a dynamic tension between them is the prime attribute that enables top-performing companies to introduce new products and achieve record profits This embracing of opposites is, to say the least, unusual in the corporate world. For Lutz, however, it is business and life\u2014as usual. What else would you expect from a vegetarian who loves a good cigar, a high-achiever who didn't graduate from high school until he was 22, a former Marine fighter pilot whose \"Law of Life\" is a line from a Rolling Stones song? Add to these paradoxes the fact that Lutz, unlike many of his peers, got into the automobile business because he actually likes cars, and he emerges as the quintessential maverick. Cinderella success story, unorthodox business primer, portrait of an iconoclastic icon, Guts is many books in one, each supplying its own brand of informative, amusing, and entertaining reading LUTZ'S LAWS: The Customer Is Not Always Right The Primary Purpose of Business Is Not \"To Make Money\" When Everyone Else Is Doing It, DON'T! Too Much Quality Can Ruin You Financial Controls Are Bad Disruptive People Are An Asset Teamwork Isn't Always Good \"Bob Lutz is one of America's most imaginative and most insightful business leaders. He thinks way outside the box, and when he talks, everyone needs to listen.\"\u2014Michael Hammer Coauthor, Reengineering the Corporatio \"Lutz has made Chrysler into the feistiest, and most profitable, automaker on the planet.\"\u2014Steve Miller CEO, Waste Management Inc \"Listening to Lutz is like hearing a Viper engine come to life. It's raw and pure. He loves speed, whether it's related to cars, fighter jets, or change in an organization.\"\u2014Kent Kresa Chief Executive Officer Northrop Grumman Corporatio \"Bob Lutz knows more about cars than anyone. And he knows more than anyone about fixing car companies . . . but what makes Bob unique is his extraordinary sense of self-confidence\u2014call it guts\u2014which has permitted him always to have fun doing the right thing. So, go get some Guts, and share the fun!\"\u2014James P. Womack Author, The Machine That Changed the World, and President, Lean Enterprise Institut \"Original and daring in his actions, Bob Lutz has lived with big business problems and big mistakes to become a rare pioneering winner.\"\u2014Donald E.

Amid the carnage and confusion, one Baudolino saves a historian and high court official from certain death at the hands of the crusading warriors and proceeds to tell his own fantastical story.  Born a simple peasant in northern Italy, Baudolino has two major gifts-a talent for learning languages and a skill in telling lies. When still a boy he meets a foreign commander in the woods, charming him with his quick wit and lively mind. The commander-who proves to be Emperor Frederick Barbarossa-adopts Baudolino and sends him to the university in Paris, where he makes a number of fearless, adventurous friends. Spurred on by myths and their own reveries, this merry band sets out in search of Prester John, a legendary priest-king said to rule over a vast kingdom in the East-a phantasmagorical land of strange creatures with eyes on their shoulders and mouths on their stomachs, of eunuchs, unicorns, and lovely maidens.  With dazzling digressions, outrageous tricks, extraordinary feeling, and vicarious reflections on our postmodern age, this is Eco the storyteller at his brilliant best.",

Fighting for identity and self-respect against the unrelenting hostility of a new stepfather, Toby's growing up is at once poignant and comical. His various schemes--running away to Alaska, forging cheeks, and stealing cars--lead eventually to an act of outrageous self-invention that releases him into a new world of possibility.",

First published in 1977, this greatly enlarged second edition discusses the new developments that have occurred over the past twelve years, provides supportive data through the 1988 election, and reveals Fiorina\u2019s current thoughts on Congress and American politics.Reviews of the first edition:\u201cA stimulating indictment of the role of Congress in perpetuating a triangle of self-interest: constituents want benefits at someone else\u2019s expense; Congressmen, seeking reelection, try to oblige; bureaucrats want growth for their agencies and accordingly provide favors for Congressmen. The general welfare is ill-served.\u201d\u2014Foreign Affairs\u201cA fascinating book . . . on the factors which keep members of Congress in office . . . . A tract that no student of Congress can afford to neglect.\u201d\u2014Eric M.

The only constant through her love-life chaos is her twin brother, Bobby, whose mysterious illness has been a source of both triumph and tragedy-no matter how hard Bella tries to wish him well. But it's only when her family faces a devastating crisis that she finally realizes the painful truth about herself and her life. And no one is more surprised than Bella herself when that journey leads her to the only person in the world who holds the key to her heart.",

        "Title": "Saving America's Treasures",
        "Authors": "By Young, Dwight (EDT) and Block, Ira",
        "Description": "America's treasures come in all shapes and sizes. Tucked away in every corner of the nation, they literally embody the history of our country and our culture -- but all too often they languish forgotten, the priceless legacy of our past crumbling quietly, inexorably, irreplaceably away. \"As a nation,\" writes First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in her eloquent foreword, \"we have allowed too much of our heritage -- the places and objects that comprise the collective memory of America -- to deteriorate. Their preservation is our sacred trust.\"  At the heart of this important effort is Save America's Treasures, a partnership between the White House Millennium Council and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, nourished by countless ordinary citizens who have pitched in to help identify and reclaim hundreds of landmark artifacts, buildings, and sites. Taken together, they tell the story of America. This fascinating, vividly illustrated book is a wonderfully varied showcase of 47 treasures, carefully selected to display the extraordinary breadth of the project's scope and profiled in a concise text that captures its place in our national chronicle.  Each chapter features an essay by such prominent writers as Thomas Mallon, Francine Prose, and Ian Frazier, who explore the many facets of the American experience: politics and government, invention and industry, quiet congregations at prayer, and exuberant crowds at play. We visit San Esteban del Rey, the mission at the heart of what is thought to be the oldest continuously inhabited community in America, and the African Meeting House in Boston, where black Americans have worshiped for two centuries. In a Texas airfield hangar we ogle a glamour girl painted lovingly onto the sleek nose of a World War II-era bomber; in Florida, we gawk at the opulent Gulf Coast palazzo of circus impresario John Ringling; in New Jersey, we peer into the prolific world of Thomas Edison, whose West Orange laboratory is a living mirror of his fertile mind. Along with these highlighted landmarks, there's also a complete list of the more than 500 preservation projects gathered into Save America's Treasures.  In these pages, we find a remarkable portrait of America: her barns and lighthouses, her factories and fun houses, and above all, her people. Encompassing everything from the private papers of our Founding Fathers to Babe Ruth's personal scrapbooks, from the ancient cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde to Taliesin, home of our quintessentially modern architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, this evocative volume offers a glimpse of a marvelous but endangered legacy -- and a heartfelt call to safeguard our heritage before it vanishes forever.",

From his account of the secret history of the California energy crisis to his devastating dissections of dishonesty in the Bush administration, Krugman tells the uncomfortable truth about how the United States lost its way. And he gives us the road map we will need to follow if we are to get the country back on track.",

And a Comic Book Rebel Named Looby!In his earlier novels, Funny Papers and Derby Dugan's Depression Funnies, Tom De Haven embarked on a dazzling tour of twentieth-century America, revealed through the world of the comic strips and their creators. Now in Dugan Under Ground, he transports us to explosive underground comics scene of the sixties.It's 1967, the Summer of Love. Roy Looby, a gifted young cartoonist, deserts his mentor, the legendary strip man Ed Biggs, and heads to join the drop-outs and musicians in San Francisco's Haight Ashbury. In the reckless spirit of the times, Looby creates \"The Imp Eugene,\" a libidinous comic book character who is a far cry from Biggs' signature figure, Derby Dugan--the cheerful icon of a more optimistic generation.  Just like his real-world counterpart, hippie cartoonist R. Crumb, Looby is soon celebrated and vilified for his creation.  And then he disappears, rumored to have lost his mind during the drug-fueled creation of a cartoon masterpiece.A fabulous, strange trip across a wildly changing America, Dugan Under Ground is a rich, inventive tale about the suffocations of jealousy, the regrets that kill the spirit, and the mythic qualities of American popular culture.",

Through her articles and live television coverage she reported on the events in Iraq before, during, and after the attacks by the American and British forces.But Seierstad was after a story far less obvious than the military invasion. From the moment she arrived in Baghdad Seierstad was determined to understand the modern secrets of an ancient place and to find out how the Iraqi people really live. In A Hundred and One Days, she introduces us to daily life under the constant threat of attack\u2014first from the Iraqi government and later from American bombs. Moving from the deafening silence of life under Hussein to the explosions that destroyed the power supply, the water supply, and security, Seierstad sets out to discover: What happens to people when the dam bursts? What do they choose to say when they can suddenly say what they like? What do they miss most when their world changes overnight?Displaying the novelist\u2019s eye and lyrical storytelling that have won her awards around the world, Seierstad here brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters to tell the stories we never see on the evening news. The only woman in the world to cover both the fall of Kabul in 2001 and the bombings of Baghdad in 2003, \u00c5sne Seierstad has redefined war reporting with her mesmerizing book.",

        "Description": "Resulting from a collaboration between The Atlantic Monthly magazine and the New America Foundation, The Real State of the Union features 18 original essays on the most important facets of our national well-being. Written by many of our nation's most insightful observers, the essays provide an objective and penetrating analysis of the most critical challenges facing America as well as innovative solutions to many of them.The State of the Union Address is among the nation's oldest rituals, but one that has deviated from its original purpose: Rather than a candid assessment of the country or a meaningful self-evaluation by the current administration, it has become a political spectacle marked by self-congratulation and spin. The Real State of the Union seeks to turn an empty exercise into a more meaningful national dialogue about the social, political, and economic health of our country. Rejecting the political correctness of both parties, this volume tells the American public what it needs to know about the real problems that plague the country and why the political solutions that are offered too often fail to address the real nature of those problems.",

Malcolm Ainslie takes a phone call he would have been better off ignoring. The caller is the chaplain at Florida State Prison, delivering a message from Elroy Doil, the serial murderer Ainslie helped put on the prison's death row. On the eve of his execution, Doil has asked to make a confession. But there is a condition: he will deliver it only in person to Ainslie.Ainslie has no choice. Doil was convicted of a double murder, but he was suspected in ten more. No homicide detective could turn down the opportunity to close ten murder cases in a single night. What Ainslie learns from the condemned man, however, propels the ex-priest-turned-cop into an investigation that reaches into the most elite levels of his own department and the Miami city government. And it tests as never before his skills as a cop and his character as a man.Master storyteller Arthur Hailey is legendary for the scrupulously researched authenticity and electrifying realism of his novels, for taking readers inside the places where men and women endure and sometimes crack under the pressures of jobs that shape our lives and world. Bristling with the sights, sounds, and true-to-life details of a contemporary urban homicide division, and with all the narrative suspense that has made him one of the best-selling fiction writers of our time, Detective is the novel Arthur Hailey was destined to write.",

Just a few of the colorfully entertaining portraits created by one of America's favorite photographers and humorists, David Graham, in Land of the Free: What Makes Americans Different. A tireless traveler and a natural-born storyteller, Graham has photographed ordinary folks in their homes, at work, and at play across the nation\u2014from his native Pennsylvania to New Mexico, and many places in between. Circus trainers, farmers, fishermen, and folks on vacation all captured on film, and all capturing the vibrant essence of being unique.Accompanied by the wry insights of National Public Radio commentator and author Andrei Codrescu, Land of the Free showcases the figures that give America its character--from the amusing portraits of celebrity look-a-likes Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis--to the stately poses of historical legends Ben Franklin, Christopher Columbus, and George Washington--to the lively real-life characters in-between.",

There are the legendary climbs of Mallory, Irvine\u2019s tragic disappearance, Hillary and Tenzing Norgay\u2019s 1953 first ascent, and Reinhold Messner\u2019s solo ascent?without the use of oxygen tanks?in 1980. There are also such electrifying tales by Mallory on surviving an avalanche in 1922, and Jon Krakauer on the 1996 disasters, plus more stories from ?the roof of the world\u201d by such climber-writers as Eric Shipton, Tom Hornbein, Frank Smythe, Bill Tilman, Wilfred Noyce, Walt Unsworth, and many more.",

        "Description": "Alone among the principal regions of the United States, the Mid-Atlantic suffers from an identity problem. Think of the South and you think at once of grits, the Civil War, and magnolias. The same applies to the Northeast (Boston baked beans, town meetings), the Midwest (the Mississippi River, corn as high as an elephant's eye), and West (John Wayne, hot tubs). But think of the Mid-Atlantic and you're likely to draw a blank.Is that fair? Does the Mid-Atlantic really possess no singular qualities? After all, it's the site of the nation's capital and of seven substantial states, each of which has its own history, geography, and culture. Doesn't this region have its own characteristics and quirks, ones that are distinctly and uniquely Mid-Atlantic in flavor?That's the question Jonathan Yardley, Pulitzer Prize-winning book critic, columnist, and native of the Mid-Atlantic, sets out to answer. In States of Mind he paints a new and surprising portrait of this previously unrecognized region, bringing out the true colors of these states in the middle, revealing their charms, their flaws, and their personalities.Starting in his adopted hometown of Baltimore, Yardley drives his high-performance all-American automobile to and through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C., a journey that enables him to capture - in the distinctive style that has made him one of the most respected newspaper writers in the country today - the essence of the Mid-Atlantic, a microcosm of the nation itself.During his travels he says farewell to Memorial Stadium in Baltimore and hello to its celebrated successor, Oriole Park at Camden Yards; visits Frank Lloyd Wright's house, Fallingwater, in the Laurel Mountains of Pennsylvania; attends a reunion at his beloved alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; gives a comparison test to the region's most famous mountain resorts, the Homestead Inn in Virginia, and its rival in turn-of-the-century splendor, the Greenbrier in West Virginia. He stops in, grudgingly, at Williamsburg, \"home of crass commercialism\"; searches for his grandparents' grave in Philadelphia; and enjoys the singular pleasure of seeing his family's name plastered all over Yardley, Pennsylvania. The author visits the birthplaces of much of America's history, and goes to the centers of much of its present - malls, outlet stores, and fast-food restaurants. He also spends a lot of time stuck in traffic on unsightly, crowded highways, musing in his curmudgeonly way about the modern world and its dubious delights.It's a journey that takes him many places, including one he had not expected to find. The reader will share his surprise and delight in this, his final discovery.",
