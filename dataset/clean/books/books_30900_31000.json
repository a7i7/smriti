        "Authors": "By Blake, William",
        "Description": "As both painter and poet, William Blake (1757\u20131827) was a powerful and visionary artist whose two early collections of poetry, Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, contain memorable lyric verses embodying the emerging spirit of Romanticism. The two works were published together in 1794 with the subtitle, \"Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul.\"The poems of Songs of Innocence describe childhood states of naturalness and purity in delicately beautiful lyrics that reveal a child's unspoiled and beatific view of life and human nature. In Songs of Experience the mood and tone darken, the poems suggesting the bitter corruptions and disillusionment that await the innocent. The contrast between the two sets of lyrics is perhaps at its most acute in the poems \"The Lamb\" and \"The Tyger,\" the latter ultimately expressing wonderment at the seemingly paradoxical coexistence of good and evil. The full texts of all the poems in the 1794 edition of both collections are included in this volume. Includes a selection from the Common Core State Standards Initiative: \"The Echoing Green.\"",

        "Description": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807\u20131882) was the most popular American poet of his time, and one of the most famous American poets of all time. It has been said that certain of his poems \u2014 the long narratives Evangeline and The Song of Hiawatha most notably \u2014 were once read in every literate home in America. A former teacher who fulfilled his dream to make a living as a poet, Longfellow taught at Bowdoin and Harvard, was eventually honored for his poetry with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge, and is one of the few Americans to have a monument dedicated to his memory in Westminster Abbey. This choice collection of his works, which reflects his mastery of a rich variety of poetic forms and meters, includes one of his best narrative poems, The Courtship of Miles Standish. Here, too, are such famous poems as \"The Village Blacksmith,\" \"The Wreck of the Hesperus,\" \"The Children's Hour,\" \"Paul Revere's Ride,\" and other poems on subjects ranging from lost youth and Giotto's Tower to slavery and the building of a ship. Includes a selection from the Common Core State Standards Initiative: \"Paul Revere's Ride.\"",

        "Description": "One of the most original and widely imitated poets of the twentieth century, William Carlos Williams (1883\u20131963) wrote verse firmly rooted in concrete experience and the particulars of everyday life. A practicing physician for more than 40 years, Williams worked in the idiom of modern American speech \u2015 unlike his friend and mentor, Ezra Pound \u2015 and his poems are redolent with a warmth and generosity of spirit. The Beat poets were particularly impressed with the accessibility of his language, and Williams's widely quoted dictum, \"No ideas but in things,\" influenced a generation of American poets.This fine selection offers readers the opportunity to study and enjoy the richness and variety of Williams's early work. More than 70 poems, published between 1917 and 1921, include \"Peace on Earth,\" \"Tract,\" \"El Hombre,\" \"Danse Russe,\" \"Keller Gegen Dom,\" \"Willow Poem,\" \"Queen-Anne's-Lace,\" \"Portrait of a Lady,\" \"The Widow's Lament in Springtime,\" and many others.",

        "Description": "Includes all of Chamberlain's known wartime lettersShows his transformation from college professor to major generalOriginal writings placed into context by historian Mark NesbittIn July 1862 Joshua Chamberlain, a family man and respected professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, joined the fight to preserve the Union. His wartime service was exemplary; he is perhaps best remembered for his outstanding leadership at Gettysburg. At all times, however, he fought bravely and well, even at Petersburg in 1864 where he received the wound that was to torment him until his death in 1914.Throughout his time in the field, Chamberlain wrote letters of recommendation to his superiors, letters of condolence to the families of soldiers killed while under his command, and letters to his family at home. All are well written, revealing the professor's educated background and elegant prose. Nesbitt's notes set the scene, place Chamberlain's writings within the larger context of the war, and make clear the General's sterling character and his sacrifices for the country he loved.",

It is not inherited, as with a family.  It is not compelling, as with a child.  And it has no means of physical pleasure, as with a mate.  It is, therefore, an indescribable bond that brings with it a far deeper devotion than all the others.\u201d\u2014Frances Farmer, ActressWhether it's the love we feel for parents, significant others, or even pets, this treasury of quotes and passages offers a wonderfully diverse way to discover the meaning of love.

        "Description": "Russian folk culture is filled with magical stories for children; tales of witches and wizardry, perilous journeys, wise animals, frightful giants, and beautiful princesses. This choice collection presents six of the most popular tales. Some bear a resemblance to the folktales of western Europe, while others introduce exotic creatures and situations unique to the Russian imagination. Among the fanciful characters young readers will encounter in these stories are the legendary Fire-bird; the dulcimer-playing Sadko, whose music could make the Tzar of the Sea dance; the iron-toothed witch Baba Yaga, and many more.British author Arthur Ransome (1884\u20131967) gathered these authentic tales from peasant storytellers on his journeys to Russia early in the twentieth century. He then retold them in English. This volume reproduces the English versions, reset in large, easy-to-read type, and illustrated with six handsome new drawings.",

        "Title": "Comparative Disadvantages?: Social Regulations and the Global Economy",
        "Authors": "By Nivola, Pietro S. (EDT)",
        "Description": "The American economy is in many ways uniquely unfettered. Nowhere else in the industrial world is it easier to set up a discount store, start a new airline, or shrink a payroll. But extensive economic deregulation has been matched by a burgeoning body of social law cracking down on business. From shareholder litigation and strict product liability to punitive environmental controls and workplace rules, entrepreneurs run a gauntlet of legal perils. The costs of this expanding and contentious agenda often exceed the value of its social benefits. The projected annual costs over benefits of the 1990 Clean Air Act, for instance, surpass the estimated value of U.S. exports blocked by all of Japan's known import restrictions. How sustainable is this situation amid the pressures of globalization? The contributors to this volume explore the question from a variety of perspectives.U.S. policymakers frequently criticize the rest of the world for policies and practices that are said to constrict American commerce. Yet some trade disputes have been ignited by questionable rules made in the United States. Indeed, legal strictures have posed barriers to imports and possibly discouraged foreign investors, as well as interfered with some U.S. exports. At times the social regulatory regime has also stirred abrasive efforts to extend U.S. sanctions to foreign soil. Even if those frictions have been of minor consequences so far, inefficient legal and regulatory conventions exact a toll on U.S. productivity growth.The book concludes that in a global economy the burdensome regulations of foreign countries deserve attention, but increasingly so do the burdens that American \"adversarial legalism\" imposes on itself and sometimes on others. Ideas and prospects for correcting the problem are discussed throughout.The contributors include Lee Axelrad, Thomas F. Burke, Loren Cass, Robert A. Kagan, Mark K. Landy, Roger G. Noll, and David Vogel.",

And that                 is why this book is of so much importance. Anne Brener has                 crafted a walkway through the valley of the shadow of death.                 The walkway has thorns and bramble bushes on it but it leads to                 the other side, beyond grief, for those who are willing to stay                 the course. Keep this book for time of need and do the                 grief-work in which it instructs us and you will see that this                 long and wise heritage of ours still has the power to speak, to                 heal and to comfort\u2014even in our time.\u201d\u2014from the Foreword by Rabbi Jack Riemer            For those who mourn a death, for those who                 would help them and for those who face a loss of any kind, Mourning & Mitzvah teaches you the power and strength available to                 you in the fully experienced mourning process.             When the temple stood in the ancient city                 of Jerusalem, mourners walked through the gates and into the                 courtyard along a specifically designated mourner\u2019s path.                             As they walked, they came face to face                 with all the other members of the community, who greeted them                 with the ancestor of the blessing, \u201cMay God comfort you                 among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.\u201d In this way,                 the community embraced those suffering bereavement, yet allowed                 for unique experiences of grief.             In this new and expanded edition of a                 modern classic, Anne Brener brings us an innovative integration                 of Jewish tradition and modern professional resources. It gives                 spiritual insight and healing wisdom to those in our own time                 who mourn a death, to those who would help them and to those                 who face a loss of any kind.",

        "Authors": "By Gaffney, Frank J. (EDT)",
        "Description": "America has been at war for years, but until now, it's not been clear with whom. We have been fighting without being clear for what. We have been waging war without using the full resources we need to win. With the publication of War Footing, Frank Gaffney and his colleagues make it clear not only whom the enemy is and how high the stakes are, but also how we can prevail. Their book explains that we are engaged in nothing less than a War for the Free World - a fight to the death with Islamofascists who adhere to a political ideology bent on our destruction. It then offers ten specific steps that Americans, as individuals and as communities, can take to ensure our way of life and the safety and well-being of our children. These steps include specific recommendations about how to know the enemy, support our troops, provide for our energy security, stop investing in terror, equip the country for war at home, counter an EMP attack, secure our borders and interior against illegal immigration, wage political warfare, launch regional initiatives, and wield effective diplomacy. This definitive, highly readable \"owner's manual\" for the War for the Free World has been written by one of the most prominent national security experts of our time, Frank J. Gaffney, and his extraordinary team of respected experts. Among them are R. James Woolsey, Victor Davis Hanson, Generals Tom McInerney, USAF (Ret.) and Paul Vallely, USA (Ret.); Alex Alexiev, Andrew McCarthy, Claudia Rosett, Michael Rubin, Daniel Goure, Caroline Glick, Michael Waller, and many others.",

But when he came to know Jesus Christ, he pursued the Christian life with great zeal. Within a few years he had a successful ministry that ultimately left him feeling empty, burned out, and, once again, far away from God.

        "Title": "Betrayal of Science and Reason: How Anti-Environmental Rhetoric Threatens Our Future",
        "Authors": "By Ehrlich, Paul R. and Ehrlich, Anne H.",
        "Description": "Despite widespread public support for environmental protection, a backlash against environmental policies is developing. Fueled by outright distortions of fact and disregard for the methodology of science, this backlash appears as an outpouring of seemingly authoritative opinions by so-called experts in books, articles, and appearances on television and radio that greatly distort what is or is not known by environmental scientists. Through relentless repetition, the flood of anti-environmental sentiment has acquired an unfortunate aura of credibility, and is now threatening to undermine thirty years of progress in defining, understanding, and seeking solutions to global environmental problems.In this hard-hitting and timely book, world-renowned scientists and writers Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich speak out against what they call the \"brownlash.\" Brownlash rhetoric, created by public relations spokespersons and a few dissident scientists, is a deliberate misstatement of scientific findings designed to support an anti-environmental world view and political agenda. As such, it is deeply disturbing to environmental scientists across the country. The agenda of brownlash proponents is rarely revealed, and the confusion and distraction its rhetoric creates among policymakers and the public prolong an already difficult search for realistic and equitable solutions to global environmental problems.In Betrayal of Science and Reason, the Ehrlichs explain clearly and with scientific objectivity the empirical findings behind environmental issues including population growth, desertification, food production, global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, and biodiversity loss. They systematically debunk revisionist \"truths\" such as:  population growth does not cause environmental damage, and may even be beneficial humanity is on the verge of abolishing hunger; food scarcity is a local or regional problem and is not indicative of overpopulation there is no extinction crisis natural resources are superabundant, if not infinite global warming and acid rain are not serious threats to humanity stratospheric ozone depletion is a hoax risks posed by toxic substances are vastly exaggerated  The Ehrlichs counter the erroneous information and misrepresentation put forth by the brownlash, presenting accurate scientific information about current environmental threats that can be used to evaluate critically and respond to the commentary of the brownlash. They include important background material on how science works and provide extensive references to pertinent scientific literature. In addition, they discuss how scientists can speak out on matters of societal urgency yet retain scientific integrity and the support of the scientific community.Betrayal of Science and Reason is an eye-opening look at current environmental problems and the fundamental importance of the scientific process in solving them. It presents unique insight into the sources and implications of anti-environmental rhetoric, and provides readers with a valuable means of understanding and refuting the feel-good fables that constitute the brownlash.",

        "Title": "JFK: Reckless Youth",
        "Authors": "By Hamilton, Nigel",
        "Description": "JFK: Reckless Youth is the first volume of a monumental new biography of John F. Kennedy - a book that will astonish, entertain, and inform all those interested in the life of America's thirty-sixth president.Who was the real JFK? Reckless Youth is filled with intriguing new material on virtually every aspect of JFK's early years: his Boston-Irish background; his beloved grandfather Honey Fitz; his draft-dodging, swindling father, Joseph P. Kennedy; his parents' disastrous and dysfunctional marriage; his loveless upbringing; his expulsion from boarding school; his false starts at college in London and Princeton, followed by his triumphant career at Harvard; his protracted struggle against his father's defeatism and isolationism before Pearl Harbor; his ceaseless career as a playboy; his lifelong battle with illness, and the origins of the deadly disease that would plague him in later days.In retelling JFK's extraordinary life story, Nigel Hamilton has finally succeeded in getting beyond the many accretions and distortions of recent years. Here at last - often in JFK's own inimitable words - is the real John F. Kennedy, at once roguish and intelligent, reckless and yet possessing fine judgment. Based on a wealth of never previously published letters and documents, and access to more than two thousand interviews, Hamilton's portrait of the tormented, fun-loving, deeply amorous, and yet ambitious youth who was John F. Kennedy is profoundly touching. JFK's courage, despite debilitating ill health, in joining the Navy and insisting on service in PT boats comes to a dramatic climax with the saga of PT 109 in the Solomons - the only American vessel ever rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer. Against this legendary backdrop Hamilton reveals for the first time the intimate story of the greatest love of JFK's early life: his passionate romance with a suspected enemy spy, Inga Arvad.The Kennedy that emerges from this volume is, behind his playboy facade, vastly more driven and more serious than historians have ever before portrayed him. As Hamilton shows us, though Joseph Kennedy reluctantly transferred the family's political mantle to his second son in 1944 and \"bought out\" the sitting congressman for Massachusetts' 11th District, the presidential dream that the ambassador had reserved for his eldest son was in fact JFK's own secret ambition, confessed to his mistress many years before his brother Joe's tragic death.In this absorbing, riveting family saga, we see the true Jack Kennedy, warts and all; a symbolic, relentlessly honest, yet sympathetic story of the struggles of youth and early manhood that will not only entrance its readers but will also forever alter our understanding of this century's most popular and charismatic American president.",
