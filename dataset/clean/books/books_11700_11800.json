At the time he was one of America's most popular living poets. His work embodied the American experience and spoke deeply to the hearts of the very people who inspired his greatest poems. For them, Sandburg symbolized America's innate integrity and boundless promise.  This volume contains the poems upon which Sandburg built his reputation and career.  The four poems selected from his rarely reprinted first collection, In Reckless Ecstasy, provide a fascinating glimpse into his developing talent.  They show him slowly breaking free of traditional verse forms toward his own voice.   This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpapers with nameplates.",

What can happen, at her age, to change her life?  In a voice that is pitch-perfect, Candida describes her health club, her social circle, and her attempts at risk-taking in her new life. She begins friendships of sorts with other women-widowed, divorced, never married, women straddled between generations. And then there is a surprise pension-fund windfall . . .

        "Description": "Salman Rushdie's most ambitious and accomplished novel, sure to be hailed as his masterpiece.At the beginning of this stunning novel, Vina Apsara, a famous and much-loved singer, is caught up in a devastating earthquake and never seen again by human eyes. This is her story, and that of Ormus Cama, the lover who finds, loses, seeks, and again finds her, over and over, throughout his own extraordinary life in music.  Their epic romance is narrated by Ormus's childhood friend and Vina's sometime lover, her \"back-door man,\" the photographer Rai, whose astonishing voice, filled with stories, images, myths, anger, wisdom, humor, and love, is perhaps the book's true hero. Telling the story of Ormus and Vina, he finds that he is also revealing his own truths: his human failings, his immortal longings. He is a man caught up in the loves and quarrels of the age's goddesses and gods, but dares to have ambitions of his own. And lives to tell the tale.Around these three, the uncertain world itself is beginning to tremble and break. Cracks and tears have begun to appear in the fabric of the real. There are glimpses of abysses below the surfaces of things. The Ground Beneath Her Feet is Salman Rushdie's most gripping novel and his boldest imaginative act, a vision of our shaken, mutating times, an engagement with the whole of what is and what might be, an account of the intimate, flawed encounter between the East and the West, a brilliant remaking of the myth of Orpheus, a novel of high (and low) comedy, high (and low) passions, high (and low) culture. It is a tale of love, death, and rock 'n' roll.",

By turns poignant, wry, hilarious, and sweet but never sentimental, Rory & Ita is an account of the moments that make up two intertwined lives and a book of tremendous warmth and humanity.

A cat, locked in a box with a radioactive atom and a vial of poison gas has a fifty-fifty chance of emerging alive. Until the door is opened, the cat inhabits both states of \"alive\" and \"dead.\" Does our perception of the cat determine its fate? Polar opposites, Juliet understands, can coexist: life and death, good and evil, truth and lies. Juliet starts to wonder if the body she spotted was ever really there. And the closer she comes to finding out, the more rapidly her roommates' lives begin to deteriorate. Finally, Juliet realizes that the truth she is looking for might better have been left in the grave.",

In-depth and up-to-date information on the controversial hormone replacement therapy (HRT) includes the risk factors, who can benefit, recommended monitoring procedures, and courses of treatment.

Fred, prowling the antique and jumble shops of Boston's Charles Street, enters one of his old haunts - Oona's - which is run by an unflappable, seen-it-all proprietress as honest about her wares as she is ruthless in her pricing and secretive about acquisitions. Oona offers Fred a painting, the image of a common gray squirrel on a chain, which he discovers has been cut from a larger canvas.Believing it to be the work of an important eighteenth-century American master, he snaps up the fragment for his employer, the eccentric Beacon Hill art collector Clayton Reed. Then he sets out to find the remainder of the painting and its origins.Fred's quest, with assistance from his lover, Molly Riley, crosses and ultimately blocks the path of Dr. Eunice Cover-Hoover, whose specialty is deprogramming former members of satanic cults. Molly, pursuing her own agenda, becomes entangles with this adept psychologist - and, shortly, murder, mayhem, and other forms of vandalism join the violence already done to the painting.",

And for anyone who likes to entertain, there are easy ideas for inventive table decorations.At the end of her book, Ms. Ohrbach shares the sources she has relied on over the years for cut flowers and arrangements, books on flowers and gardening, and catalogues for bulbs, seeds, plants, and tools and accessories.Whether you're a practiced hand at flower arranging, new to the art, or someone who just has a passion for flower-filled rooms, Simply Flowers will be a perennial inspiration.",

        "Description": "Born during the Irish revolution to Ireland's chief rabbi, Chaim Herzog spent his formative years in Dublin's Irish-Jewish ghetto before being sent to school in Palestine. An officer in the British army during World War II, he helped to liberate the German concentration camps and was one of the first Allied witnesses to the atrocities of the Holocaust.Herzog returned to Palestine as a Zionist dedicated to the formation of the State of Israel. Through his eyes we see that process: from his days in the underground movement to his rise to the rank of general in the Israeli army and his involvement in creating Israel's superb intelligence agency. In the turbulent 1970s Herzog was appointed Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, never shrinking from the fight even when it seemed the entire world was against him and his country. And in 1983 he achieved his greatest success when he was elected president of Israel, a position he held for ten years.As soldier, politician, journalist, leader, or observer, Herzog has been present at almost all the great and tragic events in Israeli history. He has fought in too many of its wars and can explain all too clearly what it's like to live in constant expectation of terrorist attacks. He can place the relationship between Israel and the PLO into historical context and tell us what it was like to deal personally with Yasir Arafat. He describes lunch with the queen of England, negotiating with Ronald Reagan, and his final conversation with Yitzhak Rabin, shortly before the prime minister's assassination.",

According to Dr. Brazelton, most of these are a normal part of growing up. Only if parents add their own anxieties to the child's natural drive toward master will these \"normal problems\" become laden with guilt and tension and deepen into chronic issues. If parents can learn to listen, to hear the stress that may lie behind psychosomatic complaints, they can not only remove some of the excess pressures, but also help their children toward self-understanding.",

With these words Edgar Mint, half-Apache and mostly orphaned, makes his unshakable claim on our attention. In the course of Brady Udall\u2019s high-spirited, inexhaustibly inventive novel, Edgar survives not just this bizarre accident, but a hellish boarding school for Native American orphans, a well-meaning but wildly dysfunctional Mormon foster-family, and the loss of most of the illusions that are supposed to make life bearable. What persists is Edgar\u2019s innate goodness, his belief in the redeeming power of language, and his determination to find and forgive the man who almost killed him. The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint is a miracle of storytelling, bursting with heartache and hilarity and inhabited by characters as outsized as the landscape of the American West.",

Delicate illustrations and quotations from the great Zen masters encourage contemplation. Although it is a movement of Buddhism, Zen principles are complementary to any system of belief. Zen techniques offer a respite from the stress of daily life, provide a healthy outlet for emotions, and promote spiritual growth and understanding. By teaching us to live in the moment, Zen infuses serenity into every aspect of life.",
