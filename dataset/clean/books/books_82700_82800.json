        "Description": "One house. Forty strangers. Add vodka and stir . . .Every summer, scores of Manhattan twentysomethings take part in an annual ritual with a camp-like culture distinctly its own: the Hamptons sharehouse. When Rachel and her two best friends buy their shares for twenty times each of their bank balances, they're imagining days filled with lazy suntanning and classy clambakes and nights spent rubbing shoulders with the Olsen twins and other celebrities. But once they arrive at 1088 Montauk Highway on Memorial Day weekend, they find that the reality falls a bit short.  What looks like any other million-dollar mansion--on the outside--plays host to drunken escapades, explicit nudity, hot tub hookups, hideous hangovers, and juvenile mischief on the inside. As housemates jockey for limited bathroom time and beer pong mania takes over the house, Rachel finds herself wondering if it's possible to find true love--or even just survive the summer--in The Hamptons.",

        "Title": "POTUS Speaks: Finding the Words That Defined the Clinton Presidency",
        "Authors": "By Waldman, Michael",
        "Description": "POTUS stands for \"President of the United States.\" Michael Waldman served as a special assistant and then chief speechwriter to Bill Clinton from 1992 to 1999. During that time, he worked closely with the president to write or edit nearly two thousand speeches, including four State of the Union addresses and two inaugural addresses. More than rhetoric, these speeches are where policy, politics, and presidential personality come together.  With four twenty-four-hour cable news channels and the Internet competing for stories, every word a president speaks can be instantly transmitted around the world. This constant media attention has transformed the ways the White House works and a president leads. POTUS Speaks takes us behind the world's most powerful bully pulpit to show us what it is like to govern in the eye of this media hurricane. It describes life within the White House gates -- including the dramatic, sometimes humorous struggles to shape the message, control policy, and win the battle for public opinion.  Waldman tells the stories behind the words at key moments in Clinton's presidency -- his speeches on the economy and trade, his calls for campaign finance reform, his budget showdowns with the GOP Congress. Waldman recounts how Clinton's dramatic 1998 State of the Union address -- a speech credited with helping to save his presidency -- came together. He shows how policymakers struggled to contain a worldwide financial crisis even as the press and the public were obsessed with scandal. Readers meet the players, from a president deeply involved in the process of crafting his speeches to the young, sometimes anonymous policy aides who guided the government.  The Bill Clinton who emerges in Waldman's candid account is not only a successful president but, in many and surprising ways, an important one. A man in love with history, obsessed with politics and policy, and highly attuned to the power of words, Clinton used the bully pulpit relentlessly. We see the sources of his uncanny ability to connect with the public. We see how he changed the presidency, using his speeches and executive actions to address long-ignored domestic issues. And we see how he worked to frame a new role for a smaller but active government.  POTUS Speaks is the first contemporary history of the two terms of the Clinton presidency to be written by a key participant. It is a major contribution to the consideration of Clinton's legacy.",

        "Description": "Something has changed. After the horrors of World War II, people everywhere believed   that it could never happen again, but today the evidence is unmistakable that anti-Semitism   is dramatically on the rise once more. The torching of European synagogues, suicide   terror in Israel, the relentless comparison of the Israelis to Nazis, the paranoid   post\u2013September 11 Internet-bred conspiracy theories, the Holocaust-denial literature   spreading throughout the Arab world, the calumny and violence erupting on American   college campuses: Suddenly, a new anti-Semitism has become widespread, even acceptable   to some. In this chilling and important new book, Ron Rosenbaum, author of the highly   praised Explaining Hitler, brings together a collection of powerful essays about   the origin and nature of the new anti-Semitism. Paul Berman, Marie Brenner, David   Brooks, Harold Evans, Todd Gitlin, Jeffrey Goldberg, Bernard Lewis, David Mamet,   Amos Oz, Cynthia Ozick, Frank Rich, Jonathan Rosen, Edward Said, Judith Shulevitz,   Lawrence Summers, Jeffrey Toobin, and Robert Wistrich are among the distinguished   writers and intellectuals who grapple with painful questions: Why now? What is\u2014or   isn\u2019t\u2014new? Is a second Holocaust possible, this time in the Middle East? How does   anti-Semitism differ from anti-Zionism? These are issues too dangerous to ignore,   too pressing to deny. Those Who Forget the Past is an essential volume for understanding   the new bigotry of the twenty-first century.",

        "Title": "Time and Chance: Gerald Ford's Appointment With History",
        "Authors": "By Cannon, James M.",
        "Description": "With unrestricted access to Gerald Ford's papers, James Cannon chronicles Ford's rise and Nixon's ruin with unprecedented depth, objectivity, and clarity. Here is the last word on Ford's ascent to the White House and on the Watergate scandal.As he fell from power, Richard Nixon caused the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War, and an obscure, stolid Middle American named Gerald Ford emerged to struggle with a foundering Federal government and a nation losing faith in that government. Time and Chance reveals how Nixon, by his own hand, ended his public career, and how and why powerful men in Congress replaced him with Ford, a man they could trust.Time and Chance also uncovers the early life of Ford, the thirty-eighth President. Born to wealth, rejected by his brutal father, reduced to poverty but saved by a courageous mother, the young Ford created a new identity and strove to reach his dreams. Through determination and good luck, he succeeded. Coming of age, he loved a captivating woman, lost her to his own ambition, loved another captivating woman, and almost lost her as well. To begin his political career, Ford confronted a corrupt political boss, beat the odds, and won. Quietly, doggedly, he worked his way up in the House of Representatives, winning loyal friends among Washington's most powerful, including Richard Nixon. He failed in his plot to become House Speaker, but won a greater prize - which he had never sought - the Presidency.Once he was in the White House, Ford prevented the trial of Nixon and saved him from prison. Was there a deal between Nixon and Ford? Why did Ford pardon Nixon? Time and Chance offers the first categorical answers to these questions. It also recounts two quintessentially American sagas, opposite yet intertwined, with trenchant insight and unstinting grace.",

        "Description": "Each of the Cates sisters had felt for a time that her husband should be put away where others could take care of him....  So begins the powerful, empowering journey of three women who decide to get a fresh start on life -- and embark upon a plan to place their men in care facilities.  Daughters of a prominent African American family, Rebecca, Claudia, and Gracelyn Cates are ready to leave their ailing husbands -- no match for their wives in their unusual vigor, strong constitutions, and mental energy -- behind. And if they play their cards right, the Cates sisters will keep their good names intact, despite the Old Testament rantings of their Baptist pastor and relentlessly gossiping neighbors in their small-town world of Peoria, Illinois.  Claudia, instructed by eldest sister Rebecca to be more outgoing, enchants her parochial neighbors with her urbane chic. Gracelyn stages a Sunday school play about Harriet Tubman. And when Hillary Clinton appears at a churchwomen's tea party they're hosting, the Cates sisters establish themselves as indisputable leaders of their community. United in their purpose, the Cates women transcend the hand fate dealt them and find themselves anew...with the possibility of midlife romance. An unforgettable story of love, loss, and sisterly devotion, Laelia is a tale about the ties that bind and liberate us all.",

She had lived in the same small apartment since her wedding, a space still dominated by her ex-husband's piano--just as her life was still defined by his decisions of so long ago.But that summer, her brother suddenly reached out to her for the first time in years, begging her to intercept and retrieve her nephew, a Paris runaway. His request propels Bea toward decisions and departures--partly well intended, partly selfish--that unravel a complex knot of siblings, spouses, exes, and Bea's extended family, in an unforgettable portrait of a middle-aged woman who finally gains the chance to escape the traps of her past. Bea travels to Paris, California, and back to New York, and the novel shifts perspective to reveal the stories of her niece, her nephew and his unexpected wife, Bea's brother and sister-in-law, and her ex-husband. The men in her life have treated her badly, as she is painfully aware, yet in finally trying to gain her own independence from them, how can she resist her own, more subtle form of counterattack and revenge?",
