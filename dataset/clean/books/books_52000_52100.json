After her debut novel -- a fictionalized (and highly sexualized) version of her life -- became an overnight bestseller, she dropped out of the public eye and turned to writing science fiction under a pseudonym. She's happily married to the tall, charming diet doctor Peter Krushelevansky and has settled into a life that she finds wonderfully predictable -- knitting in the front row of her daughter Joy's drama rehearsals, volunteering at the library, and taking over-forty yoga classes with her best friend Samantha.As preparations for Joy's bat mitzvah begin, everything seems right in Cannie's world. Then Joy discovers the novel Cannie wrote years before and suddenly finds herself faced with what she thinks is the truth about her own conception -- the story her mother hid from her all her life. When Peter surprises his wife by saying he wants to have a baby, the family is forced to reconsider its history, its future, and what it means to be truly happy.Radiantly funny and disarmingly tender, with Weiner's whip-smart dialogue and sharp observations of modern life, Certain Girls is an unforgettable story about love, loss, and the enduring bonds of family.",

        "Title": "Eating the Big Fish: How Challenger Brands Can Compete Against Brand Leaders (Adweek Book S.)",
        "Authors": "By Morgan, Adam",
        "Description": "\"Eating the Big Fish is on fire with ideas.  Best in the marketplace.\" -Steve Hayden, President, Worldwide Brand Services, Ogilvy & Mather  \"In 1986, the Levi's\u00ae Dockers\u00ae brand challenged the biggest fish in the men's apparel sea, Haggar. And we beat the pants off them! In his new book, Adam Morgan adroitly presents many of the same fundamental marketing principles which worked so well for us. A must read for marketing professionals.\" -Steve Goldstein, V.P. Marketing & Research, Levi's Brand U.S.A.    Years ago, Avis was a little fish in the car rental industry. Fearing the company would be swallowed up if they didn't \"try harder,\" Avis boldly announced its #2 status to the world through advertising-and the rest is history. Why has this approach become a marketing legend? Because there are more people who can relate to being #2, 3, or even 4, than can claim they know what it's like to be the Big Fish.  There are plenty of little fish out there, circling in schools around the brand leaders they so desperately wish to surpass. Squeezed by new competition, a retreating consumer, and aggressive retailing practices, marketers of second- and third-rank brands are struggling to survive in a business environment where they have fewer resources and less control than ever before. But instead of watching-and copying-every move the Big Fish makes, these \"Challenger\" brands need their own set of marketing rules if they have any hopes of staying afloat and competing effectively against the leader.  Eating the Big Fish is the first book that sets out to define those rules. Adam Morgan offers an innovative mental and strategic framework for those who find themselves in this new, hostile middle ground, looking for aggressive growth against the market leader. Morgan, the Joint European Planning Director of TBWA (the international advertising agency behind the campaigns for such brands as Absolut vodka, Apple computers, and Sony Playstation), has examined in detail forty of the most successful Challenger brands of the last ten years -new or relaunched brands which have achieved rapid growth (and fame) with limited marketing resources. He outlines the reasons why Challengers must think differently in order to survive, offering hands-on advice, plentiful examples, and invaluable information to help a Challenger learn how to swim out of the shadow of the Big Fish.  At the heart of the book are the Eight Credos of Challenger Brands -Morgan's analysis of the common marketing strands that these Challengers seem to share, which range in scope from the need to project who you are and what you believe in (#2, Build a Lighthouse Identity) to insights about the organizational structure and focus in such companies and brands (#8, Become Idea-Centered, Rather Than Consumer-Centered). Morgan fully analyzes each Credo, discussing in detail the marketing strategy and behavior of the specific Challenger brands that have shaped the rules. He provides case studies that include both his agency's clients and other well-known brands, such as Lexus, Oakley, Fox TV, Energizer, Virgin Atlantic, Swatch, Nissan, and more. Morgan then draws the Credos together into a \"Challenger Strategic Program\" that can be applied to the reader's own market and brand challenge, offering a proposed outline for a two-day Off-Site Program that will attempt to kick-start the Challenger process for a core group within any marketing or management team. In addition, Morgan looks at the great Challengers of the last ten years who have gone on to become brand leaders, and shows how even the rules of brand leadership have changed -why staying #1 now means, in fact, thinking and behaving like a #2.  Anyone can follow a leader. It takes a smart company to go up against the Big Fish, and Morgan's innovative, strategic program will show even the littlest fish how to make a meal out of the competition.",

While relaxing in the surgical lounge of L.A.'s Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, she half listens to a TV segment on medical tourism: first-world citizens traveling to third-world countries for surgery. But when she hears her beloved grandmother's name mentioned, Jennifer's heart nearly stops: the CNN reporter says that Maria Hernandez has died, a day after undergoing a hip replacement in New Delhi's Queen Victoria Hospital.Maria had raised Jennifer and her brothers from infancy, and the bond between grandmother and granddaughter was unbreakable. Still, the news that Maria traveled to India is a shock to Jennifer, until she realizes that it was the only viable option for the hardworking yet uninsured woman. Devastated, and desperate for answers, Jennifer takes emergency leave from school and heads to India, where relations with local officials go from sympathetic to sour as she pushes for more information. With revelations of other unexplained deaths compounded by pressure from Indian hospital officials for hasty cremations, Jennifer reaches out to her mentor, New York City medical examiner Dr. Laurie Montgomery, who has her own deep connection to Maria.Laurie, along with her husband, Dr. Jack Stapleton, rushes to the younger woman's side, and discovers a sophisticated medical facility with little margin for error. As the death count grows, so do the questions, leading Laurie and Jennifer to unveil a sinister, multilayered conspiracy of global proportions.",

        "Authors": "By Sachs, Jeffrey",
        "Description": "Jeffrey D. Sachs has been cited by The New York Times Magazine as \u201cprobably the most important economist in the world\u201d and by Time as \u201cthe world\u2019s best-known economist.\u201d He has advised an extraordinary range of world leaders and international institutions on the full range of issues related to creating economic success and reducing the world\u2019s poverty and misery. Now, at last, he draws on his entire twenty-five-year body of experience to offer a thrilling and inspiring big-picture vision of the keys to economic success in the world today and the steps that are necessary to achieve prosperity for all. Marrying vivid eyewitness storytelling to his laserlike analysis, Jeffrey Sachs sets the stage by drawing a vivid conceptual map of the world economy and the different categories into which countries fall. Then, in a tour de force of elegance and compression, he explains why, over the past two hundred years, wealth has diverged across the planet in the manner that it has and why the poorest nations have been so markedly unable to escape the cruel vortex of poverty. The groundwork laid, he explains his methods for arriving, like a clinical internist, at a holistic diagnosis of a country\u2019s situation and the options it faces. Rather than deliver a worldview to readers from on high, Sachs leads them along the learning path he himself followed, telling the remarkable stories of his own work in Bolivia, Poland, Russia, India, China, and Africa as a way to bring readers to a broad-based understanding of the array of issues countries can face and the way the issues interrelate. He concludes by drawing on everything he has learned to offer an integrated set of solutions to the interwoven economic, political, environmental, and social problems that most frequently hold societies back. In the end, he leaves readers with an understanding, not of how daunting the world\u2019s problems are, but how solvable they are\u2014and why making the effort is a matter both of moral obligation and strategic self-interest. A work of profound moral and intellectual vision that grows out of unprecedented real-world experience, The End of Poverty is a road map to a safer, more prosperous future for the world.",

Craddock combines her business background as a Lipper Award&#150;winning fund manager with her training as a social worker and years of experience as an executive coach to outline a therapeutic process that clearly separates what we want and need in order to find fulfillment from the external demands and expectations that family, society, and the workplace impose on us. Identifying our authentic career goals and strategies requires that we carefully examine our inner lives, Craddock believes, separating them from the daily demands and frustrations of our work lives.",

        "Authors": "By Slavin, Barbara",
        "Description": "With lucid analysis and engaging storytelling, USA Today senior diplomatic correspondent Barbara Slavin portrays the complex love-hate relationship between Iran and the United States. She takes into account deeply imbedded cultural habits and political goals to illuminate a struggle that promises to remain a headline story over the next decade. In this fascinating look, Slavin provides details of thwarted efforts at reconciliation under both the Clinton and Bush presidencies and opportunities rebuffed by the Bush administration in its belief that invading Iraq would somehow weaken Iran's Islamic government. Yet despite the dire situation in Iraq, the Bush administration appears to be building a case for confrontation with Iran based on the same three issues it used against Saddam Hussein's regime: weapons of mass destruction, support for terrorism, and repression of human rights. The U.S. charges Iran is supporting terrorists inside and outside Iraq and is repressing its own people who, in the words of U.S. officials, \u201cdeserve better.\u201d Slavin believes the U.S. government may be suffering from the same lack of understanding and foresight that led it into prolonged warfare in Iraq. \u00a0One of the few reporters to interview Iranian president,\u00a0Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as well as his two predecessors and scores of ordinary Iranians, Slavin gives insight into what the U.S. government may not be taking into account.\u00a0 She portrays Iran as a country that both adores and fears America and has a deeply rooted sense of its own historical and regional importance. Despite government propaganda that portrays the U.S. as the \"Great Satan,\" many Iranians have come to idolize staples of American pop culture while clinging to their own traditions. This is clearly not a relationship to be taken a face value. The interplay between the U.S. and Iran will only grow more complex as Iran moves toward becoming a nuclear power. Distrustful of each other's intentions yet longing at some level to reconcile, neither Tehran nor Washington know how this story will end.",

        "Description": "Admire or fear him, you can't ignore Rupert Murdoch. Chances are, no matter where you are, he influences your life through his newspapers, magazines or TV network. He is perhaps the world's most successful businessman, a baron of the global village - and his power is growing every day. The story of his success, as told by William Shawcross in this already controversial biography, is the business story of the decade.In a brief time, Murdoch has transformed himself from the owner of a single newspaper in an Australian backwater to the titan of News, one of the world's largest, most sophisticated communications empires. Of the six international media giants (Time Warner, Sony, Bertelsmann, Berlusconi, Disney and News), only News is owned and controlled by one man. Only News stretches completely around the earth. And only News has Murdoch, the tycoon whose life has been, in the words of Shawcross, \"an unending assault upon the world...a series of interlocking wars.\"Shawcross shows how Murdoch, perhaps more than any of the other media czars, recognized the enormous possibilities of the new age of communications and put the vision into bold action. For the first time, it is clear how Murdoch advanced up the ladder of influence, acquiring newspapers (including the Times of London, the New York Post and the Chicago Sun-Times), always buying and trading for more power.We follow Murdoch from his beginnings in print journalism to space (as he moves to surpass Ted Turner's position in satellite news) and back down to earth, where he has consolidated his reputation for toughness by playing hardball with the London unions and beating Manhattan's magazine magnates at their own game of buy and sell. Shawcross shows how Murdoch - pragmatic and merciless, though perhaps no more so than his adversaries - managed without fail to extend his reach, finally landing in Hollywood, capital of world entertainment. There, despite the predictions of skeptics and experts, he presided over the creation of a fourth successful TV network and then parted ways with the man who actually created it, Barry Diller.Shawcross describes Murdoch's incredible dash across the globe and tells us the stories behind the deals. We see his relentless ambition and his irresistible charm, his ruthless acquisitions and his biggest gambles. We see how his power evolved and how he intends to enlarge it more, exploiting the information revolution, the wave of high-tech innovation that has helped make information the most vital global commodity since oil. Shawcross lets us understand for the first time just how much power and influence Murdoch really has - and how he could use it in the future.Moving from Fleet Street newsrooms to Park Avenue boardrooms, from Murdoch's big wins to the night he almost lost everything, Shawcross provides the first truly objective picture of Murdoch. We see the \"King of Tabloids\" who pushed yellow journalism to new shades while championing the values of allies such as Reagan and Thatcher. We see the compromises, the broken promises, the betrayals, but we also see the brilliance the savvy, the unfailing popular touch, and the spark of a man whose high-wire swing around the earth must be understood by anyone who hopes to understand the world of business today - or tomorrow. Scrupulously reported, Murdoch - like its subject - is big news.",

But as even a cursory glance at recent headlines reveals, not everyone is happy with globalization. Violent protests are now a regular feature of international summit meetings, and many young people have expressed their strong opposition to policies that they see as enriching the rich at the expense of workers, the environment, and traditional culture.  As the world economy has transformed in the 1990s and early 2000s, no individual has grappled with the social and political implications of globalization more than George Soros. George Soros on Globalization seeks to assess not merely how well the world's financial institutions have fulfilled their larger mission of helping the entire world strive for prosperity, but also to point the way toward fixing the problems that have emerged in the globalization regime as a whole. Unlike other proponents of globalization, Soros does not dismiss the criticisms of the protesters; indeed, he welcomes them and acknowledges that in many ways the protesters have a clearer view of the issues at stake than the bankers and bureaucrats do. We ignore the protesters' message, Soros warns, at our peril.",

        "Description": "Scholars, politicians, and activists worldwide are finally recognizing the severity of the global environmental crisis, yet serious threats to the environmental movement remain. Anti-environmentalists dismiss the very idea of a \"crisis\" as a mirage. Much less obvious, however, is the more subtle threat masquerading under the mantle of environmentalism itself. It is this threat that Green Delusions addresses. Writing from the standpoint of a committed environmentalist, Martin W. Lewis contends that many of the most devoted and strident \"greens,\" those who propose a radical environmentalism, unwittingly espouse an ill-conceived doctrine that has devastating implications for the global ecosystem. In this book he distinguishes the main variants of eco-extremism, exposes the fallacies upon which such views ultimately flounder, and demonstrates that the policies advocated by their proponents would, if enacted, result in unequivocal ecological disaster. At once polemic and prescriptive, Green Delusions is an impassioned attempt to defend the environmental movement against extremist ideas that would lead to self-defeating political strategies.",

        "Description": "A fifteenth-century painting by a Flemish master is about to be auctioned when Julia, a young art restorer, discovers a peculiar inscription hidden in a corner: Who killed the knight? In the painting, the Duke of Flanders and his knight are locked in a game of chess, and a dark lady lurks mysteriously in the background. Julia is determined to solve the five-hundred-year-old murder, but as she begins to look for clues, several of her friends in the art world are brutally murdered in quick succession. Messages left with the bodies suggest a crucial connection between the chess game in the painting, the knight&#39;s murder, the sordid underside of the contemporary art world, and the latest deaths. Just when all of the players in the mystery seem to be pawns themselves, events race toward a shocking conclusion. A thriller like no other, The Flanders Panel presents a tantalizing puzzle for any connoisseur of mystery, chess, art, and history.",

Twenty dramatic double-page and five single-page illustrations arranged in chronological order vividly display the evolution of the dinosaurs from the early reptilian Euparkeria to such giants of the dinosaurs' last days as Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops.Young and old alike can share in the excitement of bringing color to such formidable specimens as Tyrannosaurus; the equally aggressive Allosaurus; the spike-thumbed Iguanodon, a large, plant-eating biped; the bony-plated Ankylosaurus; and, of course, the familiar Brontosaurus, also known as Apatosaurus, a plant-eating \"lizard\" that weighed up to 30 tons and grew to a length of 70 feet.An excellent educational tool for teachers, this coloring book offers hours of absorbing entertainment to students, dinosaur buffs, natural-history enthusiasts and colorists of all ages. Informative captions for each illustration provide intriguing details about the ancient animals depicted in this reptilian review.",
