That fact, in the face of a society enormously uneasy with gay adoption, makes for an edgy, entertaining, and illuminating read. When Dan and his boyfriend are finally presented with an infant badly in need of parenting, they find themselves caught up in a drama that extends well beyond the confines of their immediate world. A story about confronting homophobia, falling in love, getting older, and getting a little bit smarter, The Kid is a book about the very human desire to have a family.",

        "Description": "Chris Mooney, author of The Republican War on Science and one the leading young environmental journalists and bloggers working today, immerses readers in the world of those who study hurricanes. What was once an arcane branch of meteorology (itself an arcane science) has become embroiled in one of the politicized and hotly contested debates in American science: whether or not the recent hurricane disasters\u2014culminating in Katrina\u2014are connected to global warming. Mooney follows the lives and careers of the two leading scientists who stand, bitterly opposed, on either side of the issue. One believes global warming has nothing to do with hurricane ferocity or frequency; the other believes as fervently that it does; both have staked their reputations on their respective positions. Mooney shows these two men in action as they debate the issue across the country and are followed by the media. He also uses them as a way of showing how Hurricane Studies have evolved, and how government, the media, Big Business, and politics, have affected the ways we study and interpret weather patterns. Hurricanes are natural disasters, capable of inflicting almost unimaginable destruction. The culture that has grown up around predicting, charting, and even defining them is very much man-made. Combining lively portraits of the leading figures, vivid science journalism, and the very latest reportage from weather front (the last section of the book will cover the 2006 hurricane season), Mooney\u2014a native of New Orleans\u2014has written what will surely be one of the most talked-about books of the year.",

        "Description": "We are in the midst of a crisis.The evidence is all around us. From the ashes of Enron, Adelphia, and WorldCom, there can be little doubt that the leadership that dominates corporate America is failing and extending to our other modern institutions as well\u2014political, religious, family, and media.Our culture\u2019s legacy of leadership is in trouble, and the crisis is not one of competence but of character.When Les Csorba writes \u201cleadership is character in motion,\u201d few can make this claim credibly. Csorba is a recruiter with the world\u2019s premier executive search firm, who draws from more than twenty years of leadership experience serving a United States senator, a governor, and as special assistant to President George H. W. Bush in the White House.Trust explores the nature of leadership as a distinctly moral calling. Csorba\u2019s urgent call is for a new moral leadership over today\u2019s dominant pragmatic brand. And as Csorba takes a look at the leadership style of today\u2019s more well-known leaders, he unveils the \u201c7 Principles of Trust,\u201d demonstrating how the most influential leaders are:Purified in the fires of their own sufferingShaped by mentors, individuals who are willing to \u201cbuild their lives into others\u201dCalled for a purpose that transcends personal ambitionAt the heart of this journey is a call to integrity, character . . . and trust. The critical question, then, for today\u2019s leaders and for a new generation that holds the potential to change the future is this: How will you keep the trust?Whether you have already embraced the call to lead, or you are part of a new generation of emerging young leaders, Les T. Csorba challenges you to step up and become a leader of character. The need is great. The time is now. And withTrust, the future is full of possibility.Endorsements:\u201cLes Csorba gets to the root of the leadership dilemma: we are all self-interested, yet true leaders master the urge to safeguard their positions and instead consistently put the interests of the groups they lead before their own.\u201d\u2014Sherron S. Watkins, Former Enron Corp. Vice President and Time Person of the Year 2002\u201cLes is right on target in emphasizing how important trust is in becoming a great leader . . . he centers on the most important principles in life\u2014honesty and integrity\u2014and gets an A+ in my book.\u201d\u2014Drayton McLane Jr., Chairman, McLane Group (Owner, The Houston Astros)\u201cTrust is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding what character traits make a great leader. When it comes to leadership, character still counts!\u201d\u2014Joe Scarborough, Host of MSNBC\u2019s Scarborough Country and Former U.S. Congressman\u201cPlacing our trust in leadership is, indeed, an act of faith on our part. Perhaps at no time before has our need for wise instruction in this arena been so critical\u2014for the sake of the survival of the world . . . and no book better at clarifying the scene than Les Csorba\u2019s!\u201d \u2014Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, Founder and President, International Fellowship of Christians and Jews\u201cI\u2019ve read several manuscripts during the last 10 years, mostly on leadership, andTrust is the most comprehensive, readable, and accurate book that I have read.\u201d\u2014Archie W. Dunham, Chairman, ConocoPhillips\u201cLes Csorba puts into words a lesson I learned in business, politics, and diplomacy: Without honesty and trust, even simple problems can ripen into disasters; with honesty and trust, even the most contentious disputes can be settled.\u201d\u2014James A.

The problem is that many people, after being persuaded, find that this truth is both liberating and devastating.It\u2019s liberating because it endorses our inborn desire for joy. And it\u2019s devastating because it reveals that we don\u2019t desire God the way we should. What do you do when you discover the good news that God wants you to be content in him, but then find that you aren\u2019t?If joy in God were merely the icing on the cake of Christian commitment, this book would be insignificant. But Piper argues that joy is so much more. Our being satisfied in God is necessary to show God\u2019s worthiness and to sustain sacrifices of love.Jesus endured the cross for the joy that was set before him. He tasted it. It sustained him through the deepest suffering. His Father was glorified. His people were saved. That is what joy in God does.The absolutely urgent question becomes: What can I do if I don\u2019t have it? With a pastor\u2019s heart and with radical passion for the glory of Christ, John Piper helps you answer that question.",

Three major \"tribal\" events - the long-running Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, \"Dinah\" (the annual Dinah Shore Golf Tournament and party circuit, a mecca for upwardly mobile luppies), and a cross-country trek with the activist Lesbian Avengers en route to the 1994 Stonewall commemoration - provide points of entry into an exploration of lesbian identity, social dynamics, and politics that's as entertaining as it is revealing.

Using that experience, Shaughnessy circles back to his own boyhood and calls on the many sports greats he's known over the years -- Ted Williams, Roger Clemens, Larry Bird -- to capture that uniquely American rite of passage that is sports.Growing up, Dan Shaughnessy was so baseball-obsessed that he played games by himself and didn?ft even let himself win. His son, Sam Shaughnessy, came by his own love of sports naturally and was a natural hitter who quickly ascended the ranks of youth sports. Now nicknamed the 3-2 Kid for his astonishing ability to hover between success and failure in everything he does, Sam is finally a senior, and it's all on the line: what college to attend; how to keep his grades up and his head down until graduation; and whether his final high school baseball season, which features foul weather, a hitting slump, and a surprising clash with a longtime coach, will end in disappointment or triumph.All along the way, Dad is there, chronicling that universal experience of putting your child out on the field -- and in the world -- and hoping for the best. With gleaming insight, wicked humor, and, at times, the searching soul of an unsure father, Shaughnessy illuminates how sports connect generations and how they help us grow up -- and let go.",

How did he become this\u00a0one man great enough\u00a0to risk the fate of the nation on the well-worn but cast-off notion that all men are created equal?Here award-winning historian John C. Waugh takes us on Lincoln\u2019s road to the Civil War. From Lincoln's first public rejection of slavery to his secret arrival in the capital, from his stunning debates with Stephen Douglas to his contemplative moments considering the state of the country he loved, Waugh shows us America as Lincoln saw it and as Lincoln described it. Much of this wonderful story is told by Lincoln himself, detailing through his own writing his emergence onto the political scene and\u00a0the evolution of his beliefs about the Union, the Constitution, democracy, slavery, and civil war. Waugh brings Lincoln\u2019s path into new reliefby letting the great man tell his own story, at a depth that brings us ever closer to understanding this mysterious, complicated, truly great man.",

The crux of Ms. Barkley's system is a direct and equal participation between parent and child, who, recast as coach and client, work together to answer three questions: Who am I? Where am I going? How do I get there? Surveying is introduced, a technique that combines research with networking to get a good first-hand look at what's out there. Then the \"coach\" takes the \"client\" past the resume trap and shows him or her how to be an effective interviewee. Throughout, feature boxes cover everything from how to write a thank-you letter to the subtle 12 phrases every coach should learn to ensure cooperation.

        "Description": "\"This is a very important book . . . mandatory reading for anyone thinking about getting into e-commerce.\"-Peter G. Neumann Moderator of the Risks Forum and author of Computer Related Risks  The World Wide Web is changing the way the world engages in business. With this paradigm shift comes uncertainty about how secure e-commerce transactions are over an inherently insecure medium-the Internet. Businesses have learned the hard way that there is no \"silver bullet\" solution-not encryption, not firewalls, not even secure protocols. Like a chain, the security of e-commerce is only as strong as its weakest link.  Written by security expert Anup K. Ghosh, E-Commerce Security highlights the weak links and provides best defenses for individuals and enterprises connected to the Internet. This valuable guide addresses vulnerabilities in four essential components of electronic commerce-the data transport protocol, Web server, Web clients, and the network server operating system.  E-Commerce Security: * Exposes the dangers of new Internet innovations in today's Web browsers, including push technology and desktop integration with the Internet * Methodically explains the dangers of active content programs downloaded from Web sites, such as Java applets, ActiveX controls, and JavaScript * Provides a comparison of different secure protocols for e-commerce, including digital cash protocols used in smart cards * Presents security considerations for Web servers, online databases, and server-side application software * Details shortcomings in firewall technology and other host security measures.

Simple but imaginative \"palate openers\" such as Tuna Tapenade are followed by a profusion of salads, from All-Star Herb Salad, which captures the essence of the herb garden in a single bite, to the vibrant, cream-dressed greens of the Cheesemaker's Salad.Vegetables have a special place in the hearts and palates of Provence's cooks, so Patricia presents an entire chapter of quick-and-easy vegetable creations.Soul-satisfying soups have their own chapter, with such delights as Summer Pistou and the deeply flavorful Caramelized Fennel Soup. Pastas, too, are on the menu, with inventive dishes like Provencal Penne and Spaghetti with Green Olive Puttanesca, inspired by the produce of Patricia's village market. A chapter on breads includes everything from Crusty Wheat & Polenta Bread to an olive oil brioche, a local classic.Poultry and game are represented with everything from Butter-Roasted Herbed Chicken to Monsieur Henny's Rabbit Bouillabaisse. In the fish and shellfish department, you will savor Seared Pancetta-Wrapped Cod and The Vaison Fishmonger's Fresh Tuna Casserole. When it comes to meat, Patricia offers recipes for earthy daubes, the slow-simmered almost-stews so beloved by the French, along with homey favorites like Lemon-Thyme Lamb Chops, and Spit-Roasted Brine-Cured Pork.To round out the meal, there is a treasure trove of desserts based on seasonal fruits - Cherry-Almond Tart, Winemaker's Grape Cake, and Patricia's Apricot-Honey-Almond Tart, as effortless as child's play but as impressive as the most exacting work of the pastry-maker's art.",

James MacKay uses all his skills as a historical detective to produce this definitive biography, telling the incredible story of a man who, without wealth or noble birth, rose to become Guardian of Scotland. William Wallace, with superb generalship and tactical genius, led a country with no previous warlike tradition to triumph gloriously over the much larger, better-armed, and better-trained English forces. 700 years later, the heroism and betrayal, the valiant deeds and the dark atrocities, and the struggle of a small nation against a brutal and powerful empire, still create a compelling tale.",

        "Authors": "By Gueron, Judith M., Pauly, Edward, and Lougy, Cameran M.",
        "Description": "From Welfare to Work appears at a critical moment, when all fifty states are wrestling with tough budgetary and program choices as they implement the new federal welfare reforms. This book is a definitive analysis of the landmark social research that has directly informed those choices: the rigorous evaluation of programs designed to help welfare recipients become employed and self-sufficient. It discusses forty-five past and current studies, focusing on the series of seminal evaluations conducted by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation over the last fifteen years. Which of these welfare-to-work programs have worked? For whom and at what cost? In answering these key questions, the authors clearly delineate the trade-offs facing policymakers as they strive to achieve the multiple goals of alleviating poverty, helping the most disadvantaged, curtailing dependence, and effecting welfare savings. The authors present compelling evidence that the generally low-cost, primarily job search-oriented programs of the late 1980s achieved sustained earnings gains and welfare savings. However, getting people out of poverty and helping those who are most disadvantaged may require some intensive, higher-cost services such as education and training. The authors explore a range of studies now in progress that will address these and other urgent issues. They also point to encouraging results from programs that were operating in San Diego and Baltimore, which suggest the potential value of a mixed strategy: combining job search and other low-cost activities for a broad portion of the caseload with more specialized services for smaller groups. Offering both an authoritative synthesis of work already done and recommendations for future innovation, From Welfare to Work will be the standard resource and required reading for practitioners and students in the social policy, social welfare, and academic communities.",

In this book, Shane Claiborne describes an authentic faith rooted in belief, action, and love, inviting us into a movement of the Spirit that begins inside each of us and extends into a broken world. Shane\u2019s faith led him to dress the wounds of lepers with Mother Teresa, visit families in Iraq amidst bombings, and dump $10,000 in coins and bills on Wall Street to redistribute wealth. Shane lives out this revolution each day in his local neighborhood, an impoverished community in North Philadelphia, by living among the homeless, helping local kids with homework, and \u201cpracticing resurrection\u201d in the forgotten places of our world. Shane\u2019s message will comfort the disturbed, and disturb the comfortable . . . but will also invite us into an irresistible revolution.

        "Authors": "By Reagan, Ronald, Anderson, Martin, Anderson, Annelise (EDT), Shultz, George P. (FRW), Skinner, Kiron K., and Anderson, Annelise",
        "Description": "In the last years of Ronald Reagan's life, his voluminous writings on politics, policy, and people finally emerged and offered a Rosetta stone by which to understand him. From 1975 to 1979, in particular, he delivered more than 1,000 radio addresses, of which he wrote at least 680 himself. When drafts of his addresses were first discovered, and a selection was published in 2001 as Reagan, In His Own Hand by the editors of this book, they caused a sensation by revealing Reagan as a prolific and thoughtful writer, who covered a wide variety of topics and worked out the agenda that would drive his presidency. What was missed in that thematic collection, however, was the development of his ideas over time. Now, in Reagan's Path to Victory, a chronological selection of more than 300 addresses with historical context supplied by the editors, readers can see how Reagan reacted to the events that defined the Carter years and how he honed his message in the crucial years before his campaign officially began.  The late 1970s were tumultuous times. In the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, America's foreign and domestic policies were up for grabs. Reagan argued against the Panama Canal treaties, in vain; against the prevailing view that the Vietnam War was an ignoble enterprise from the start; against d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union; against the growth of regulation; and against the tax burden. Yet he was fundamentally an optimist, who presented positive, values-based prescriptions for the economy and for Soviet relations. He told many inspiring stories; he applauded charities and small businesses that worked to overcome challenges.   As Reagan's Path to Victory unfolds, Reagan's essays reveal a presidential candidate who knew himself and knew his positions, who presented a stark alternative to an incumbent administration, and who knew how to reach out and touch voters directly. Reagan's Path to Victory is nothing less than a president's campaign playbook, in his own words.",

        "Description": "In one of his most ambitious physical efforts to date, Dean Karnazes attempted to run 50 marathons, in 50 states, in 50 days to raise awareness of youth obesity and urge Americans of all fitness levels to \"take that next step.\"\"UltraMarathon Man: 50 Marathons - 50 States - 50 Days\", a Journeyfilm documentary, follows Dean\u2019s incredible step-by-step journey across the country.Ultrarunning legend Dean Karnazes has run 262 miles-the equivalent of ten marathons-without rest. He has run over mountains, across Death Valley, and to the South Pole-and is probably the first person to eat an entire pizza while running. With an insight, candor, and humor rarely seen in sports memoirs (and written without the aid of a ghostwriter or cowriter), Ultramarathon Man has inspired tens of thousands of people-nonrunners and runners alike-to push themselves beyond their comfort zones and be reminded of \"what it feels like to be truly alive,\" says Sam Fussell, author of Muscle. Ultramarathon Man answers the questions Karnazes is continually asked: - Why do you do it?- How do you do it?- Are you insane? And in the new paperback edition, Karnazes answers the two questions he was most asked on his book tour: - What, exactly, do you eat?- How do you train to stay in such good shape?",

        "Description": "If he knows he's going to die, why shouldn't a doctor just help him die?Shouldn't we treat her as kindly as we treat our dogs or cats?What about all these tubes?Give me an easy conclusion for this painful situation.Joni Eareckson Tada was confronted with these questions not only as she struggled against her own paralysis, but as she sat in her wheelchair by the bedside of her dying father. So much suffering, so much pain, she thought. Why not end it all quickly ... painlessly?More and more people who are terminally ill are choosing assisted suicide. Other groups such as the elderly, the disabled, or even the depressed or suicidal are being swept up into this movement of \"self deliverance.\" Books on suicide are becoming bestsellers.Bypass suffering. Leapfrog the dying process. Put a quick end to merciless pain and mental anguish. These are tempting enticements to those who hurt.When Is It Right to Die? counterbalances such \"quick fix\" advice with alternatives of hope, compassion, and death with real dignity. Tada offers help to those who see assisted death measures on their state ballots and wonder when legalized suicide will become a reality.Behind every booklet printed by a right-to-die or a right-to-life group is a family. A family like yours. A disabled person like Joni. In her warm, personal way, Joni takes her reader into the lives of families, the elderly, the disabled, and the terminally ill and lets them speak about assisted death.What they say is surprising.For those who agonize over the \"when\" and \"how\" of dying at a time when assisted suicide is being openly debated, When Is It Right to Die? gives guidance toward answers that are ethical, appropriate, and ... right. In an age of advancing medical technology, who has not pondered the questions, \"How do I want to die? Can I control the way I will one day die?\" This book is for those who want help for the single national issue that will personally touch everyone's life.Tada doesn't give pat conclusions. She doesn't hold to the position of life support when death is imminent. Instead she gives warm comfort from God and her experience and practical help to meet the hard, cold realities for those facing, or considering, death.Not a dissertation on ethics, this book is filled with personal stories of real individuals facing life-and-death questions and finding ... hope.",

The incident, a result of good but woefully misguided juvenile intentions, forced his family to leave their home, and eventually forced him, at age twenty-nine, to return to his hometown in search of three old friends. Reminiscent of both To Kill a Mockingbird in its touching portrait of childhood, and the beautifully written brand of suspense that calls to mind Smilla\u2019s Sense of Snow, The Snowman\u2019s Children is an unusually controlled and original novel that establishes Hirshberg as an important new voice in American literature.",

But what appears to be a straightforward missing persons case quickly becomes something much more deadly. March unearths a rat's nest of family strife, business betrayals, and deceptions, and finds that Danes left a long line of enemies in his troubled wake - some of whom are also hunting for the missing man.March's investigation now takes on a terrifying urgency as it leads him through the corrupt corridors of white-collar crime and the underworld of the Russian mob, and into the more intricate maze of the human heart.",
