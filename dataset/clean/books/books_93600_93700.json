The city and its outlying villages are surrounded by a nearly invisible wall of magic that protects all who dwell here from both the nomadic human invaders that attack each year, and the hungry spirits which are drawn to the living energies of the Silver Lake yet can never break through the barrier to claim this life force for themselves. It is here in heart of Gol-Beyaz that, long ago, the Gods were born: Estavia, crimson-eyed midnight God of Battles; blue Usara, God of Healing; icypale Incasa, God of Prophecy, oldest and most mysterious of all the Gods; Oristo, ruddy brown, bi-gender God of Hearth and Home; many-colored Ystazia, God of the Arts; leaf-green and earth-brown Havo, bi-gender God of Seasonal Bounty. These are the six Immortal Patrons of Anavatan, and of all who dwell within the city's walls. Or almost all. For though the priests of the Temple Precinct might deny it, there are still those - thieves, street urchins, and the like - who have not given their pledge, their allegiance, their hearts and souls to any of Anavatan's deities.",

A focus on doing our duty and living by reason\u2014when what weknow trumps how we feel\u2014can leave us feeling dead. We need to have our passion restored in order to live the life that Jesus came to give us. InFeel, Matthew Elliott takes a critical look at what our culture and many churches have taught about controlling and ignoring our emotions. He contends that some of the great thinkers of the modern era got it all wrong, and that the Bible teaches that God intends for us to live in and through our emotions. Emotions are good things that God created us to feel. Matthew helps us to understand our emotions and equips us to nurture healthy feelings and reject destructive ones. So refresh yourself, drink deeply, and learn to live with a new, passionate heart.",

A fascinating new take on the concept of collective intelligence and its colorful manifestations in some of our most complex problems, The Smart Swarm introduces a compelling new understanding of the real experts on solving our own complex problems relating to such topics as business, politics, and technology. Based on extensive globe-trotting research, this lively tour from National Geographic reporter Peter Miller introduces thriving throngs of ant colonies, which have inspired computer programs for streamlining factory processes, telephone networks, and truck routes; termites, used in recent studies for climate-control solutions; schools of fish, on which the U.S. military modeled a team of robots; and many other examples of the wisdom to be gleaned about the behavior of crowds-among critters and corporations alike. In the tradition of James Surowiecki's The Wisdom of Crowds and the innovative works of Malcolm Gladwell, The Smart Swarm is an entertaining yet enlightening look at small-scale phenomena with big implications for us all.",

        "Description": "A flamboyant and controversial personality of enormous wit and intelligence, Voltaire remains one of the most influential figures of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Candide, his masterpiece, is a brilliant satire of the theory that our world is \"the best of all possible worlds.\" The book traces the picaresque adventures of the guileless Candide, who is forced into the army, flogged, shipwrecked, betrayed, robbed, separated from his beloved Cunegonde, tortured by the Inquisition, et cetera, all without losing his resilience and will to live and pursue a happy life.",

        "Description": "Sophie Edgar barely recognizes her husband, Thomas, an amateur naturalist, when he returns from the Amazon, where he had hoped to find his long-dreamed-of mythical butterfly, Papilio sophia. The optimistic young Edwardian gentleman is gone, replaced by a weak, nearly mute shadow of the man she married. Unable to break through his heartbreaking silence, Sophie must glean what she can from his diaries and boxes of exquisite butterflies in order to discover what happened to Thomas in the lush and perilous jungles of Brazil. In the process, she learns as much about herself and her marriage as she does about the secrets harbored by a haunted soul.A magnificent debut, written in rich and sensuous prose, Rachael King's The Sound of Butterflies is an unforgettable journey from the demure gentility of turn-of-the-twentieth-century England into the heart of darkness.",
