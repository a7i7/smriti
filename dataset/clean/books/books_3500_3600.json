Eventually he became the company's top salesman in the city, the region, and finally the country. Along the way he learned powerful life lessons that he imparted to those around him. One of those people was Shelly Brady, first hired by Porter as a typist and driver, later a great friend. In this inspiring book, she brings together those lessons. These seemingly simple ideas ? \"Mothers Know Best,\" \"Persistence Pays Off,\" \"Know Your Limits but Reach Beyond Them\" ? resonate powerfully when seen through the lens of a life lived to the fullest against what would be impossible odds for many. Whether finding cooperative bellmen to button his cuffs or beaming a video to his speaking engagements because of ill health, Porter, whose life story became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the 1990s, gets the job done with a smile ? and shows readers how to do the same.",

        "Authors": "By Montville, Leigh",
        "Description": "Generation after generation watched and hoped and prayed for victory. And generation after generation turned away frustrated and disappointed- 1946 (when the Sox lost the World Series in 7 games), '48 (lost a one game play-off to Cleveland), '49 (heartbreak to the Yankees), '67 (again, lost the Series in 7), '75 (and again, lost the Series in 7), Bucky in '78, Buckner in '86, Boone in 2003. Yet every spring the fans flocked back, hopeful again. The losing, the angst, the self-flagellation became so routine that it even developed marketing names. The suffering was called \"The Curse of the Bambino\". The sufferers were called \"Red Sox Nation\" - the ultimate underdogs. Would it ever end?    And then it did.    Why Not Us? is about what the Red Sox's amazing victory in the 2004 World Series meant to the fans. It's about how it felt to be a Red Sox fan - not only at 20 minutes to midnight on October 27, 2004, but decades before. Leigh Montville, best-selling author of Ted Williams and At the Altar of Speed, has interviewed dozens of fans: friends, friends of friends, old sportswriters, ball-players, public figures, and plain folk. Here are their stories-bittersweet stories of passion and pain, eternal hope and crushing despair, the seemingly endless agony and the strange ecstasy of being a Red Sox fan.",

        "Description": "Ballooning government? Millionaire welfare queens? Tort lawyers run amok? A $330,000 outhouse, paid for with your tax dollars? John Stossel says, \"Give me a break.\"When he hit the airwaves thirty years ago, Stossel helped create a whole new category of news, dedicated to protecting and informing consumers. As a crusading reporter, he chased snake-oil peddlers, rip-off artists, and corporate thieves, winning the applause of his peers. But along the way, he noticed that there was something far more troublesome going on: While the networks screamed about the dangers of exploding BIC lighters and coffeepots, worse risks were ignored. And while reporters were teaming up with lawyers and legislators to stick it to big business, they seldom reported the ways the free market made life better.In Give Me a Break, Stossel explains how ambitious bureaucrats, intellectually lazy reporters, and greedy lawyers make your life worse even as they claim to protect your interests. Taking on such sacred cows as the FDA, the War on Drugs, and scaremongering environmental activists -- and backing up his trademark irreverence with careful reasoning and research -- he shows how the problems that government tries and fails to fix can be solved better by the extraordinary power of the free market.He traces his journey from cub reporter to 20/20 co-anchor, revealing his battles to get his ideas to the public, his struggle to overcome stuttering, and his eventual realization that, for years, much of his reporting missed the point.Stossel concludes the book with a provocative blueprint for change: a simple plan in the spirit of the Founding Fathers to ensure that America remains a place \"where free minds -- and free markets -- make good things happen.\"",

Brought to Redhouse on a mysterious trip by his distraught mother, Robert becomes fascinated with Annalise, for unlike him, she is rich in magic that she keeps carefully hidden, and not quite of this world.But after that same magic claims his mother, Robert flees to London.

        "Description": "It was the greatest invasion of all time. Early on the morning of June 6, 1944, thousands of Allied soldiers landed on the beaches of Normandy-not only streaming from the sea but also sweeping in from the air-and launched a massive assault on Nazi-occupied France. In sixteen unforgettable hours, these heroic men succeeded in breaching the Third Reich's impregnable defenses, leading the way to the liberation of Europe.As the sixtieth anniversary approaches, those who remember that epic invasion are rapidly dwindling in number. Now, their gripping eyewitness accounts-most of them never before published-are woven into an authoritative new look at that unforgettable \"longest day\" by distinguished military historian Dan van der Vat. This book captures and preserves for a new generation all the human drama and heroism that marked D-Day. Richly illustrated with hundreds of historical photographs-many from private photo albums-as well as personal artifacts, dramatic paintings by the many war artists on the scene, and modern color photographs, this is the definitive history of one of the most important dates of the twentieth century.",

From a wildly imaginative meditation on who Lolita would be at age fifty to a send-up of the warning labels on medicine bottles, these pieces, many of which first appeared in The New Yorker, hilariously and intelligently skewer the topic at hand. Pure Drivel will have readers crying with laughterand marveling that in addition to all of his many talents, Steve Martin is also a superb writer. Like the fuzzy little puff of marabou on the instep of a coquettes satin bedroom slipper... Martins book of diminutive, often hilarious essays [is]... effortless and silly even as its subtly erudite. \u02dc Salon Martin is a gorgeous writer capable of being at once melancholy and tart, achingly innocent and astonishingly ironic.

A decade ago, she was unexpectedly chosen to become head chef of one of the world's most luxurious spas in Hawaii.

Critics from the New York Times, Esquire, Food & Wine, Bon App\u00e9tit, and the Los Angeles Times raved. Kathleen herself lost seventy-five pounds.Now, in this book, Chef Kathleen shares her sassy philosophy and the secrets of her weight-loss success story while giving you the tools to make healthy changes for yourself. Falling in love with her food is easy, with recipes like Split-Roasted Chicken and Potatoes, Buttermilk Baked Onion Rings, Sesame Ginger Shrimp, Green Beans with Lemon and Parmesan, and Dark Chocolate Cherry Cheesecake, and the book is packed with shortcut tips, comments from real people, and suggestions for transforming one meal into a second, equally delicious one.

        "Description": "Years after the end of her marriage and the death of her remote, beloved father, Camilla Archer's tightly pinned down existence is upended by her dreams. A man at least as real as her real life begins appearing to her at night, a mysterious figure in a mask and tuxedo, offering up unexpected visions and reinventions of key moments in her past.Camilla sells theater memorabilia for a living, and this odd figure seems familiar. He reminds her of someone named Meyerhold, a legendary Russian director who was killed during Stalin's purges. The masked man collaborated with this director in strange ways - and now he is doing the same with Camilla, serving as the sly impresario of her dreams.So begins Camilla's piecing together of the puzzle of her past. This journey embraces the story of her mother, whom Camilla never knew; her father's life as an international perfumist and his self-devised death; and secrets touching on her recently deceased cousin, Eve, and Eve's only child, Danny, now a young woman. Even Camilla's long-ended marriage must eventually come under scrutiny. Traveling in memory and reverie back to Moscow and Paris between the wars, Camilla has the chance to unknot her life - if she's willing to ask why a ghostly double has infiltrated her dreams and what he's wanting her to discover. Complex scents of loss and love suffuse the novel's atmosphere as family mysteries are resolved, if not solved.",

        "Title": "Terrors and Marvels: How Science and Technology Changed the Character and Outcome of World War II",
        "Authors": "By Shachtman, Tom",
        "Description": "The dreadful global conflagration known as the Second World War was more than the clashing of great armies on bloody battlefields. A different kind of war was being waged in the secret laboratories on both sides of the conflict -- a war that would alter the course and determine the outcome of the bitter hostilities, forever changing our world and future.In a stunning amalgam of science and history, Tom Shachtman, the critically acclaimed author of Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold and The Phony War, 1939-1940, gives us a riveting chronicle of World War II's forgotten combatants: the engineers, physicists, chemists, and academics whose contributions to the war effort were as important as the noble sacrifices of the soldiers, sailors, and airmen who bravely risked their lives.While it is a widely accepted fact that America's development and employment of the atomic bomb ended the Pacific struggle -- and that the failure of Hitler's scientists to develop their own A-bomb helped to doom Germany -- little note has been made of the other remarkable scientific accomplishments of this dark and terrible epoch. Beginning with a fascinating overview of the Depression-era struggle to establish scientific and military alliances that would ultimately enable the Allies to catch up to the Axis's early dominance, Terrors and Marvels offers an eye-opening history of the furious battles for technological superiority covertly waged by the world's most brilliant minds.From the creation of faster, deadlier jets and rockets to the development of biological, chemical, and electronic warfare -- from astonishing advances in medical science to breakthroughs in radar and decoding -- the incredible successes and failures that occurred in top-secret facilities around the world in the early 1940s never made headlines but often determined triumph and defeat. Here, also, are the intensely human stories of the architects of the terrifying war machines -- men and women of rare intelligence and integrity torn by the conflicting demands of conscience and country, haunted by their roles in the use and abuse of powerful science.Edifying, enthralling, startling, and sobering, Terrors and Marvels is a masterful work that sheds light on the astonishing achievements of a remarkable few and the great and terrible technology that swung the pendulum of victory in the Allies' direction.",

        "Description": "As a result of her own experience with many kind of loss, Stephanie Ericsson offers an intimate, profoundly touching guide for those in grief, legitimizing the complex and often taboo emotions we all feel when loss transforms our lives. In  Companion Through the Darkness, Stephanie Ericsson defines grief as \"the constant reawakening that things are now different.\" Using a very simple format -- which combines excerpts from her own diary writings with brief essays -- she vividly speaks the language of loss and captures the contradictory, wrenching, and chaotic emotions of grief. The book can be opened at any point to chapters no more than a few pages long on such themes as:  Abandonment: The sudden state I am forced into. I no longer belong to you. I no longer belong to anyone.   Rage: The state I use to survive seemingly moments of intolerable pain.   Humor: The backside of agony.   Pity: The look on people's faces when they haven't a clue what to say to me.   Transition: The moments, strung out over months, when I know I am no longer the woman I was, but not quite the woman I am becoming.   The result is compelling, intimate, and heartbreakingly truthful -- a book that promises to be enormously sought-after support and touchstone for all those making their own journey through grief.",

The crime is shocking by any standards, East or West. Three American soldiers - one an officer - were seen entering a Seoul apartment party with a young Korean male. The officer - now Drummond's client - is charged with strangling the Korean, and with crimes even more heinous. Ominously, the victim happens to be the son of a venerated war hero currently serving as South Korea's defense minister.But it gets even better. Drummond finds himself paired with his old law school rival, Katherine Carlson, a consummate legal brawler whose specialty is defending controversial clients. Almost immediately, Drummond is locking horns with her on issues of strategy and principle, and wondering what to make of her conflicting sexual signals. Before he knows it, he's in way over his head - the odd man out on a legal team that is antagonizing the diplomatic corps, grandstanding in the international press, and encountering lethal resistance.Struggling to stay on top of all the maneuvers, Drummond must duel with his attractive co-counsel in a tantalizing contest of wits...while confronting the machinations of a vast conspiracy that seeks to destroy him. Threatened - and seduced - by \"allies\" who may not be who they seem, Drummond will be forced to take dangerous risks to establish, once and for all, who his friends are...and who's trying to kill him.",

And yet from the moment Nader declared his presidential candidacy on Meet the Press, he's faced relentless opposition, mainly from Democrats fearing that competition from an inspiring independent could dent their voting block \"as it did in 2000.\"  Even his old pals at The Nation joined in the party panic.Now, in The Good Fight, Nader swings back harder than ever at those who \"want to block the American people from having more voices and choices\" and have lost touch with the concept that votes must be earned, not inherited or entitled. He takes on corporate-occupied Washington and the government's daily abuse against ordinary citizens: \"Corporations are saying no to the necessities of the American people. They're saying no to health insurance for everyone, no to a living wage, no to tax reform, no to straightening out the defense budget, which is bloated and redundant, no to access to our courts.\" And most of all, he urges a speedy return to stronger civic motivation. If fed-up citizens don't actively join the fight for improvement, then ultimately we have no one to blame but ourselves for the inadequate checks on the erosion of our civil liberties.In an era when politicians sell us rhetoric and then sell out our principles, Nader stands as a crucial voice of candor. The Good Fight is a call to awareness and action that will captivate readers of all political stripes and help us define what we must do to shape the brightest future for our nation.",

And how did their bond become stronger and more complex as they grew older? 2. Hattie is the self-sacrificing epitome of the strong Black woman. What made her this way? How did the murder of her young sister shape her views of Hispanics? What did she see in Lola that touched her heart? Why do you think she agreed to raise Juanita, and what motivated her to build such an elaborate lie surrounding Juanita\u2019s birth and parentage? What could Lola and Pierre have done differently? 3. While Juanita experiments mildly with acts of bulimia in Chocolate Sangria , the novel is clearly not meant to address bulimia as a health issue or to resolve the crisis of bulimics in our society. Yet, what effect did Juanita\u2019s weight and ambiguous looks have on her self-esteem? Were her efforts to make herself appear as \u201cBlack\u201d as possible understandable? How confusing and dismaying might it have been for her to look through her family photo album and not see anyone who looked remotely like her? Is our self-identity determined by our physical features and our environment, or does it come from within? 4. Each of the main characters in Chocolate Sangria suffered tragic experiences that influenced events over the course of their lives. How did you feel about Scooter? Could his early trauma have been partially responsible for the choices he made later on in life? What was lacking in his character and in his life that made him such a willing victim to Jorge? Should he have turned himself in to the authorities for his role in the robbery, or was his shame, his stabbing, and the realization of how his father really died punishment enough? 5. What role, in your opinion, did Uncle Herbie play in Chocolate Sangria? From where did his sense of obligation and responsibility toward Hattie and Juanita spring? How helpful was he in providing balance to Hattie\u2019s biases? In providing positive reinforcement as Juanita struggled to accept her weight and body-type? 6. The role Conan played in the death of his twin brother and the guilt he experienced as a result of Thor\u2019s death was powerful and intense. His love for his best friend, Jorge, was also deep and profound. Do you think Conan\u2019s guilt was a factor in his allegiance to Jorge, even when he himself felt betrayed? And after losing Thor, why did Conan draw closer to Jorge? Might it have been easier for Conan to see Jorge\u2019s true colors if his eyes were not so clouded with grief? 7. How do you think the sadistic sexual abuse Jorge suffered as a child contributed to his outlook on non-Hispanics and his inability to feel remorse for using and abusing others, especially in terms of sexual domination? Was there something unnatural about the possessiveness he felt toward Conan, or might this type of behavior be typical of those who have experienced early trauma and suffered childhood loss? Was Jorge gay? Straight? Or simply an opportunist? 8. At the conclusion of Chocolate Sangria Scooter is at a crossroads in his life. What direction can you visualize his life taking? Did he use Sol Steinberg in much the same manner that Jorge used him? Can his friendship with Juanita be restored to its former level? How is he likely to feel about Juanita\u2019s growing relationship with Conan? 9. In Chocolate Sangria people of color share limited resources and a common community, however, intra-racial prejudice is experienced on many levels. Why do you think minorities in America compete against each other, and what can this be attributed to? Is it realistic to think that two people, in spite of different backgrounds and family pressures, can love each other and stay happily together? 10. What is more necessary to Juanita and Conan\u2019s lasting love: their commonalities or their differences? How does the diversity in their ethnicities bring them closer together? Juanita was obviously Black and proud. Does being pro-Black mean you must also be anti other races? 11. Which of the characters in Chocolate Sangria did you identify with the most? The least? Which is more important to human relations, tolerance or respect? What are the biggest challenges you face in tolerating, respecting or accepting others who are VERY different from you? \u00a0What would it take for you to overcome those challenges?",

What at at first seems a simple if burdensome duty becomes treacherous when the professor begins to rave: pleading with invisible tormentors, denouncing his family, his colleagues, and a system in which a scholar is \"just a piece of meat on a cutting board.\"Are these just manifestations of illness, or is Yang spewing up the truth?

In the hard-knuckled thirties, he was the immigrant boy who made it big -- the dominant star in the New York Yankees dynasty. He was Broadway Joe, the icon of elegance, the man who wooed and won Marilyn Monroe -- the most beautiful girl America could dream up.  Joe DiMaggio was a mirror of our best self. And he was also the loneliest hero we ever had.  In this groundbreaking biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Richard Ben Cramer presents a shocking portrait of a complicated, enigmatic life. The story that DiMaggio never wanted told, relates his grace and greed; his dignity, pride, and hidden shame. It is a story that sweeps through the twentieth century, bringing to light not just America's national game, but the birth (and the price) of modern national celebrity.",

        "Authors": "By Noonan, John Thomas",
        "Description": "Narrowing the Nation's Power is the tale of how a cohesive majority of the Supreme Court has, in the last six years, cut back the power of Congress and enhanced the autonomy of the fifty states. The immunity from suit of the sovereign, Blackstone taught, is necessary to preserve the people's idea that the sovereign is \"a superior being.\" Promoting the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity to constitutional status, the current Supreme Court has used it to shield the states from damages for age discrimination, disability discrimination, and the violation of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and fair labor standards. Not just the states themselves, but every state-sponsored entity--a state insurance scheme, a state university's research lab, the Idaho Potato Commission&#151;has been insulated from paying damages in tort or contract. Sovereign immunity, as Noonan puts it, has metastasized. \"It only hurts when you think about it,\" Noonan's Yalewoman remarks.Crippled by the states' immunity, Congress has been further brought to heel by the Supreme Court's recent invention of two rules. The first rule: Congress must establish a documentary record that a national evil exists before Congress can legislate to protect life, liberty, or property under the Fourteenth Amendment. The second rule: The response of Congress to the evil must then be both \"congruent\" and \"proportionate.\" The Supreme Court determines whether these standards are met, thereby making itself the master monitor of national legislation. Even legislation under the Commerce Clause has been found wanting, illustrated here by the story of Christy Brzonkala's attempt to redress multiple rapes at a state university by invoking the Violence Against Women Act. The nation's power has been remarkably narrowed.Noonan is a passionate believer in the place of persons in the law. Rules, he claims, are a necessary framework, but they must not obscure law's task of giving justice to persons. His critique of Supreme Court doctrine is driven by this conviction.",

When the fanatics gather-be they chiliheads or barbecue fiends-and hunker down at the hot plate, it can be a recipe for delight or disaster as attitudes get spicy and tempers flare. Bursting with humor, Cookoff is an entertaining and in-depth look at a quirky, cutthroat, and (sometimes) delicious world.",

Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will.  Questions that will affect the rest of your life.Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough.  By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine.  From Huntington's disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Matt Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome.
