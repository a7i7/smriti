        "Description": "Addiction invades every region and demographic in the United States, affecting more than 23 million Americans and putting families though a heartbreaking cycle of recovery and relapse. Many people give up and never find the right treatment that will enable them to break free of their addiction forever.Offering a radical new approach, clinical psychologist Dr. Morteza Khaleghi argues that the vast majority of drug and alcohol addiction is driven by an emotional trauma. A pioneer of the dual diagnosis recovery program, he treats the body for chemical dependency while simultaneously ministering to the emotional block that serves as a trigger for relapse. A regular advisor on the Dr. Phil show, Dr. Khaleghi has mapped out recovery plans for thousands of patients and their families.  Well-known facilities such as Hazelden, Sierra Tucson, and the Betty Ford Center refer their toughest cases to him, looking to his vast experience and high rate of success. In this groundbreaking book, he teaches you the methods that have made him the therapist that other therapists turn to for advice. Families will learn how to\u2022           Recognize addictive behavior\u2022           Plan and stage effective interventions\u2022           Work on the family dynamics that enable addictionPatients will learn to\u2022           Become self aware about addictive behavior \u2022           Identify the emotional trauma that is at the heart of nearly every addiction\u2022           Detect early signs of relapse and take preemptive measures Drawing on over 20 years of experience healing patients, Dr. Khaleghi's insightful, nurturing and-- above all--breakthrough book is geared to anyone looking for help with dependency and to the spouses, parents, children, and friends who bear the brunt of this damaging disease.

        "Authors": "By Bennett, William J.",
        "Description": "To resce the future, we must remember our past.With command and wit, William J. Bennett reacquaints Americans with their heritage in an engaging narrative that cuts through the cobwebs of time, memory, and prevailing cynicism. Washington, Franklin, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and others reemerge not as marble icons or dust-dry names in a textbook, but as full-blooded, heroic pioneers whose far-reaching vision forged a nation that attracted?that still attracts?millions yearning to breathe free. In this, the first volume of a \"reasoned, balanced presentation of the American story,\" Bennett tells our nation's story, with all its triumphs and tragedies. He summons us to embrace America's cause once again as \"the last best hope of earth.\"What others are saying:\"William J. Bennett artfully and subtly makes connections between our past and current events, reminding us ... that we are intimately and immediately connected to the extraordinary Americans who have bestowed upon us our great heritage.... [T]he importance of America: The Last Best Hope probably exceeds anything Dr. Bennett has ever written, and it is more elegantly crafted and eminently readable than any comprehensive work of history I've read in a very long time. It's silly to compare great works of history to great novels, but this book truly is a page-turner.... Prepare to have your faith in, hope for, and love of America renewed.\"-Brad Miner, American Compass\"The Role of history is to inform, inspire, and sometimes provoke us, which is why Bill Bennett's wonderfully readable book is so important. He puts our nation's triumphs, along with its lapses, into the context of a narrative about the progress of freedom. Every now and then it's useful to be reminded that we are a fortunate people, blessed with generations of leaders who repeatedly renewed the meaning of America.\"-Walter Isaacson, Benjamin Franklin: An American Life\"For too long Americans have been looking for a history of our country that tells the story of America's triumphs as well as its tragedies. Now Bill Bennett has come forward withAmerica: The Last Best Hope, which tells the story-fairly and fully-from 1492 to 1914. Americans who have been reading recent biographies of the Founding Fathers will love this book.\"-Michael Barone, US News & World Report\"Bill Bennett's book will stand as perhaps the most important addition to American scholarship at this, the start of the new century. For the past fifty years American historians have either distorted American history or reduced it to a mess of boring indictments of our cultural and political heritage. With this book Bennett offers to Americans young and old an exciting and enjoyable history of what makes America the greatest nation on earth.-Brian Kennedy, president, The Claremont Institute",

(Page 25) The United States Air Force estimates that collisions between aircraft and birds, about two thousand a year, cost $100 million annually-and about twenty injured or dead airmen?

(Page 243) The space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986 crippled the U.S. intelligence satellite network between 1986 and 1990 and would have left the U.S. military almost blind in the event of a major conflict? (Page 245) Most helicopters on combat ships cannot be used more than twenty to forty hours a month? (Page 179) For over twenty years, the U.S. Navy has been successfully using sea lions, dolphins, and whales to guard its ships from enemy divers? (Page 195)In addition to recounting everything from the merely trivial to the truly terrible, the authors help readers to look at the big picture, reminding us that ignorance is not bliss where the military is concerned.",

        "Description": "What are the special qualities that all successful entrepreneurs have in common? Let Lloyd Shefsky show you with his insider's \"crash course\" in entrepreneurship as he lets you listen in on the guiding dreams, unique thought processes, and hard-won wisdom of such leading entrepreneurs as Michael Dell, Harold Geneen, Gordon Segal, and dozens of others. Whether it's Ben Cohen discussing how he conceived Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream ... Fred Smith talking about his creation of Federal Express ... Debbi Fields sharing secrets of her success with Mrs. Fields Cookies ... or Jay Pritzker explaining what can be learned from his experiences as the founder of the Hyatt chain of hotels, every one of these remarkable men and women agrees that entrepreneurs are made not born. Moreover, the author has combined their tales of success with his own experience and theories and shaped them all into concrete lessons that can be followed by anyone. You'll learn the secrets of generating ideas ... how to find and unlock your own \"Dream Drawer\" (everyone has one!); taking risks ... how to recognize and overcome a number of widely held misconceptions that non-entrepreneurs have about the nature of risk; conquering the fear of failure ... by learning to use fear as a spur to success and yesterday's failure as today's invaluable lesson; developing a strong work ethic ... and, at the same time, avoiding the trap of compulsive workaholicism. (Contrary to popular belief, successful entrepreneurs are not workaholics!); breaking the rules and being a maverick ... to see a dream through from inception to fruition; preparing for opportunity in advance ... to be ready and able when the opportunity does come knocking; and perhaps most important of all, conquering the popular myths that can stop you: myths ranging from \"You have to be young to embark on an entrepreneurial career\" ... to \"I'd have to give up too much of my private life\" ... to \"I'm doing so well where I'm at that I have too much to lose by going off on my own.\" Once you've read the diverse, inspiring success stories contained in this book, you'll know that none of the above myths are true!Whether you're employed or fresh out of school, unemployed or retired, a single parent or a recent widow, unsatisfied or unfulfilled, you'll find all the guidance you need to take a dream and build it into a successful business.",

        "Description": "Glenn Greenwald was not a political man \u2014 neither liberal nor conservative. To him, the U.S. was generally on track and would remain forever centrist. But all that has changed. Over the past five years, a creeping extremism has taken hold of our federal government, which threatens to alter our system of governing ourselves and our national character. This extremism is neither liberal nor conservative, but is driven by the Bush administration's radical theories of executive power. Greenwald writes that we cannot abide these unlimited and unchecked presidential powers if we are to remain a constitutional republic.  Because when you answer to no one, you're not a president \u2014 you're a despot. This is one man's story of being galvanized into action to defend his country, and his concise and penetrating analysis of what is at stake for America when its president has secretly bestowed upon himself the powers of a king. From 9/11 to the question of nuclear war in Iran, Greenwald shows how Bush's claims of unlimited power play out. In the spirit of the colonists who once mustered the strength to denounce a king, Greenwald asks: how would a patriot act today?",

        "Description": "Just as culture is critical to understanding the dynamics behind any thriving community, organization, or business, the daily realities and deep structure of school life hold the key to educational success. Reforms that strive for educational excellence are likely to fail unless they are meaningfully linked to the school's unique culture. In Shaping School Culture, Terrence E. Deal and Kent D. Peterson show how leaders can harness the power of school culture to build a lively, cooperative spirit and a sense of school identity.The authors draw from over twenty years of research on school improvement as well as from their own extensive work with school leaders across the country to identify viable new strategies for effective school leadership. They describe the critical elements of culture--the purposes, traditions, norms, and values that guide and glue the community together--and show how a positive culture can make school reforms work. Deal and Peterson also explore the harmful characteristics of toxic cultures and suggest antidotes to negativity on the part of teachers, students, principals, or parents.Using real-life cases from their own research, Deal and Peterson provide concrete, detailed illustrations of exemplary practice in different school cultures. They reveal the key symbolic roles that leaders play in school change and identify the specific skills needed to change school culture successfully. Shaping School Culture provides an action blueprint for school leaders committed to transforming their schools for success.",

Stites come of age in Oriente Province, where the Americans tend their own fiefdom\u2014three hundred thousand acres of United Fruit Company sugarcane that surround their gated enclave. If the rural tropics are a child's dreamworld, Everly and K.C. nevertheless have keen eyes for the indulgences and betrayals of the grown-ups around them\u2014the mordant drinking and illicit loves, the race hierarchies and violence. In Havana, a thousand kilometers and a world away from the American colony, a cabaret dancer meets a French agitator named Christian de La Mazi\u00e8re, whose seductive demeanor can't mask his shameful past. Together they become enmeshed in the brewing political underground. When Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro lead a revolt from the mountains above the cane plantation, torching the sugar and kidnapping a boat full of \"yanqui\" revelers, K.C. and Everly begin to discover the brutality that keeps the colony humming. Though their parents remain blissfully untouched by the forces of history, the children hear the whispers of what is to come. Kushner's first novel is a tour de force, haunting and compelling, with the urgency of a telex from a forgotten time and place.",

        "Title": "Chasing the Sun: Rethinking East Asian Policy",
        "Authors": "By Abramowitz, Morton and Bosworth, Stephen",
        "Description": "During the past half century, U.S. policy in East Asia was guided by a simple dictum: avoid the domination of East Asia by any power other than the United States. Increasingly, however, this policy approach seems questionable in a globalizing world, a massively changed East Asia, and a much deeper U.S. economic involvement in the region. Even as East Asian leaders often tell Americans they want a continued U.S. presence for security purposes, they also fear an American effort to \"contain\" China that will put them between a rising regional power and the global superpower, creating dangerous tensions that ultimately would threaten the region's golden goose&#151;China's powerful economic growth engine. Others, like some Japanese, would welcome a conclusion by the United States that a powerful China ultimately threatens American interests.    The Post-American Century in East Asia addresses major policy problems of East Asia&#151;from the management of our relations with China to the North Korean nuclear problem to the growth of East Asian regionalism. The book answers how, in light of East Asia's growing power and influence, the United States can retain influence commensurate with its interests. The transformation of the region requires us to ask whether some longstanding perspectives are still relevant, as well as what changes are needed in American policy.",
