On the shelf, but still best friends . . .   Cath is scatty, messy and guarded. While Si is impossibly tidy, bitchy and desperate for a man of his own. They are total opposites - but equally unlucky in love. And they've stuck together through thick and thin. Because that's what best friends do.   So when their beautiful friend Portia - the undisputed queen of their group of friends at university - steps back into their lives, after a ten year gap, her reappearance tests both Cath and Si's friendship to the limit.   What does Portia want? Will she be a force for good in their lives, or something darker? And will Cath and Si ever get lucky in love?

She had a gratifying job as a special-needs teacher in an elementary school, many friends, a loving family, and a fianc\u00e9, Scott Greene, whom she was soon to marry. One month later she was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and from that moment, her world turned upside down.\u00a0In this inspirational and informative book, Dani\u2019s parents, Jay and Sue Shotel, vividly convey the strength and courage their daughter displayed in her battle with AML as they recount her unforgettable journey to recovery. The Shotels provide a wealth of information about leukemia, about the role each family member played in supporting Dani, about the anguished quest for medical answers, the myriad decisions a family must make amid the medical maze, the value of love and friendship, and the generosity of the young German citizen, Tom, who donated the marrow that saved Dani\u2019s life. In this practical guide for others who must fight cancer, the Shotels discuss the importance of medical coverage, of being a self-advocate, of asking questions and educating oneself about the disease, of drawing strength and energy from\u00a0 and showing appreciation to those involved in the wellness process.\u00a0Listen to an interview with the authors.",

But it was John's wife who both enchanted and haunted this small town.Floyd, manager of Main Street Hardware, coveted John's wife. Otis just plain loved her. And Daphne loved her too, but Daphne thought she'd love her even more if John's wife were dead. And Gordon was obsessed with capturing the very essence of her on film, though this was impossible since John's wife just didn't seem to be there. That was the strange thing about John's wife - she seemed to have a thereness that just was not quite there. She was always in the hearts and minds of the town, an endearing and ubiquitous presence, yet few people, if asked, could describe her, even when she passed right before their very eyes. To this small town John's wife was as much a mystery as a coveted object.",

That war will affect every nation on Earth, including America, and will affect every person on Planet Earth.\"- John HageeThe nuclear storm clouds are gathering over Iran and Israel and casting a long shadow on America and several other countries!SHOCKING INFORMATION OF THE IMPENDING WAR:What is the Pentagon&#39;s contingency plan for the use of nuclear weapons against at least seven countries?Where will the United States use the bunker-busting mini-nukes, and how will they reduce the collateral damage?To what extent are Russians, French, and Germans helping Iran achieve its dream of a nuclear holocaust?How will an attack on Jerusalem affect America?Jerusalem Countdownby best-selling author John Hagee anticipates Israel&#39;s strategies toward any Iranian threat and the resulting effect upon America. Can anyone actually believe that the Islamic fanatics presently in charge of the Iranian government would not use these weapons on America?Hagee skillfully unveils the reasons Islam and Israel cannot dwell peaceably together as he paints a convincing picture explaining why Christians must support the Holy Land.\"Those nations who align with God&#39;s purposes will receive His blessing. Those who follow a policy of opposition to God&#39;s purposes will receive the swift and severe judgment of God without limitation.\" -John Hagee",

More than twenty years later, it is still the go-to book that women of all ages look to for comfort, help, and understanding when their mother dies. Building on interviews with hundreds of mother loss survivors, Edelman's personal story of losing her mother, and recent research in grief and psychology, Motherless Daughters reveals the shared experiences and core identity issues of motherless women:Why the absence of a nurturing hand shapes a woman's identity throughout her lifespanHow present day relationships are defined by past lossesHow a woman can resolve past conflicts and move toward acceptance and healingWhy grief really is not a linear passage but an ongoing cyclical journeyHow the legacy of mother loss shifts with the passage of time",

At the same time, enough data and depth are presented to make this book suitable for many upper-division classes and a valuable resource for students who will keep it in their personal libraries after their formal studies are completed. The goal of this book is to provide an up-to-date, introductory view of essential themes in environmental science along with emphasis on details and case studies that will help students process and retain the general principles.",

The text includes a comprehensive discussion of the fundamentals of criminal investigations and the method for reconstructing an event or crime. The ideas presented in this book are based on three major sources of information: people, physical evidence, and records.      The authors organize the parts of the text into three sections. The first section covers the foundation and principles of criminal investigation, including responsibilities and attributes of an investigator; interpretation of physical evidence; discovery of crime scenes; and the preservation, collection and transmission of evidence. Included in this division of the text is the illustration and discussion of the methods of seeking and obtaining information from people and records; followed by the discussion about surveillance, witness identification and interrogation procedures. The second part of the book covers the application of the principles discussed in the first section to criminal investigation. It includes the procedures of reconstructing the past events and the crime, and constitutional law, which forms the appropriate methods of criminal investigation and the categories of crimes. The last section of the book presents numerous special topics such as the emergence of crime, terrorism and urban disorder, computers and technological crime, and enterprise crime.

        "Title": "Dr. Nancy Snyderman's Guide to Good Health: What Every Forty-Plus Woman Should Know About Her Changing Body",
        "Authors": "By Blackstone, Margaret and Snyderman, Nancy L., M.D.",
        "Description": "It's undeniable. Your body is changing. It's no longer responding the way you expect, the way it always has in the past. You're starting to worry about heart disease, osteoporosis, even menopause. Your old methods for dealing with issues like skin care or sexuality are no longer quite so effective. That old biological clock keeps steadily ticking away.And yet you don't feel as old as society seems to think you are. You're still full of sass and vitality, barely middle-aged. But all those minor aches, persistent pains, chronic diseases, and numerous other conditions of your over-forty body demand attention. Are you overreacting to them? Or are you underplaying their importance?Dr. Nancy Snyderman knows exactly what you're going through. She is a practicing physician, the medical correspondent for ABC-TV's Good Morning America, and, most important, a woman. At age forty-three, she is the mother of three young children. She's asked all the questions about your changing health that you have. And now she's written a book that contains all the answers. As a doctor she has an intimate knowledge of the current medical system. As a female patient, she knows what you want from that system. And as a news correspondent, she knows the system's greatest strengths and its greatest weaknesses.Dr. Nancy Snyderman's Guide to Good Health is a groundbreaker, brimming with wit, personality, and authority, and sprinkled with anecdotes from Dr. Snyderman's life. If you are a woman over forty years of age and you want to get the most out of a medical system that isn't custom-designed for you, this book will show you how.",

        "Description": "Dressing up as an eighteenth century farm girl is not how Betsy Odell imagined spending the summer before her senior year of high school, but her history professor father insists she take a job at Morrisville Historic Village. To make matters worse, Liza Murphy, only the biggest freak from school -- piercings, tattoos, bleached hair -- works as a farm girl too. As far as Betsy can tell, her summer will be miserable and any chance of ever being popular is doomed.   When tragedy strikes Betsy close to home, her boyfriend and 'friends' are nowhere to be found, and her job becomes a welcome escape from the real world. James, a Morrisville employee from the next town over, is probably the greatest -- not to mention cutest -- guy Betsy has ever met, and Liza is surprisingly normal and fun. Caught between two worlds -- old and new -- Betsy is soon struggling with two versions of herself. Combining backdrops of historic Morrisville with the normal teenage world of beach parties, learning to drive, and broken hearts, Tara Altebrando writes a hilarious and fun novel of one girl's search for love and happiness\u0160and the unlikely places she finds them.",

        "Title": "Terrorism and U.S. Foreign Policy",
        "Authors": "By Pillar, Paul R.",
        "Description": "The United States government-backed by the overwhelming support of the American public-takes a hard line against international terrorism. The tenets of official U.S. counterterrorist policy are: make no concessions or deals with terrorists; bring them to justice for their crimes; isolate and apply pressure on states that sponsor terrorism; and bolster the counterterrorist capabilities of countries willing to work with the United States. While these tenets are sound principles, their application, specifically overseas, raises difficult questions. Does the \"no deal\" policy actually deter terrorists acts? Are there cases where agreements might reduce terrorism, while advancing other U.S. interests? Do isolation and pressure really force offending states to alter their support for terrorists? What factors affect the willingness, not just the capability, of foreign governments to help the United States in counterterrorism? In this critical study, a career CIA officer provides a guide to constructing and executing counterterrorist policy, urging that it be formulated as an integral part of broader U.S. foreign policy. In the first four chapters, Paul R. Pillar identifies the necessary elements of counterterrorist policy, he examines why the United States is a prime terrorist target, and he reveals why the counterterrorist policies that seem strongest are not always the most effective. Chapter 5 examines the widely varying nature of terrorist groups and the policy tools most appropriately applied to them. Chapter 6 focuses on states that sponsor terrorism (including Iran, Libya, North Korea, and Cuba), along with those that enable it to occur (particularly Greece and Pakistan). Pillar examines ways in which the American public's perspective toward terrorism can actually constrain counterterrorist policy, and he concludes that terrorism cannot be \"defeated\" only reduced, attenuated, and to some degree, controlled. The final chapter summarizes his recommendations for amending U.S. policy.",

        "Authors": "By Knights, Michael",
        "Description": "Knights (of the Washington Institute) provides recommendations for the future shape of US military strategy in the Persian Gulf region that are based on the following principles: the US should seek to expand basing agreements and military partnerships with the \"friendly, conservative Arab monarchies\" of the Gulf Cooperation Council, encourage formalized multinational cooperation in the region, and encourage the GCC to address social drivers of insecurity. These principles lead him to recommend that the US build intelligence- sharing networks, greater land-border security initiatives, maritime patrolling competencies, and counters to low-level Iranian pressures among the military forces of the GCC. To reduce Iranian perceptions of threat from these steps, he also recommends supporting a Gulf security forum that includes the Iranians and all regional states for addressing bilateral and multilateral issues, with the exception of \"broader regional issues\" involving the Israelis.
