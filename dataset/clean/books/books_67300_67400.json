        "Description": "Appealing to the amateur wine lover as well as the aspiring professional taster, The Simon & Schuster Beginner's Guide to Understanding Wine is written to be eminently readable. Michael Schuster's expertise is combined with a well-developed sense of humor, which allows him to avoid -- and have fun with -- the snobbery and occasional absurdity of tasting and understanding wine.  This beautiful and accessible guide progresses in three sections. The first explores the techniques of wine tasting -- from knowing what to look for to describing and recording a judgment. Readers are encouraged to experiment and develop their own tasting methods.  The second section discusses the major grapes and their wines. The author explains how to discern between wines considered to be \"classic\" and those that are not, what to expect from the different grapes and their blends, and the different wine-producing areas. He suggests specific wines to taste for comparison and as examples of style and quality. He tops off this section with a chapter covering fortified wines, Cognac, Armagnac, and malt whisky.  The final section of the book is devoted to the practicalities of wine and wine drinking: handling, serving and decanting, storage, and record-keeping. An extensive, original index provides an at-a-glance identification chart of the grapes used in all the major wine names.  The Simon & Schuster Beginner's Guide to Understanding Wine is a friendly, lavishly illustrated introduction to the fundamentals of wine appreciation.",

But these two historical events only bracketed a life that covers the sweep of an extraordinary century.John Glenn's autobiography spans the seminal events of the twentieth century. It is a story that begins with his childhood in Ohio where he learned the importance of family, community, and patriotism. He took these values with him as a marine fighter pilot during World War II and into the skies over Korea, for which he would be decorated. Always a gifted flier, it was during the war that he contemplated the unlimited possibilities of aviation and its frontiers.We see the early days of NASA, where he first served as a backup pilot for astronauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom. In 1962 Glenn piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 Friendship 7 spacecraft on the first manned orbital mission of the United States. Then came several years in international business, followed by a twenty-four year career as a U.S. Senator-and in 1998 a return to space for his remarkable Discover mission at the age of seventy-seven.",

        "Description": "At last! This special cookbook puts flavor and choice back on the menu for people with diabetes and their familiesBetty Crocker, America's most trusted friend in the kitchen, has teamed up with the International Diabetes Center (IDC)--one of the leading medical centers--to create an indispensable source of easy-to-make recipes and up-to-the-minute food and nutrition information for the growing numbers of people who have diabetes, more than 15 million of them.Here is the first cookbook to include recipes featuring Carbohydrate Choices--the new, simplified approach to meal planning recommended by the American Diabetes Association. For people who find diet exchanges too hard, too limiting or too much work, this new method is a real breakthrough. Each of the book's 140 recipes shows the number of Carbohydrate Choices per serving, so that planning the rest of the meal is easy. From Old-Time Beef and Vegetable Stew to Creamy Vanilla-Caramel Cheesecake, the recipes are made with everyday ingredients, including sugar. No food groups or ingredients are left out, so there's no need for anyone to feel deprived or restricted to a special diet. Food exchanges are also included, making it easy for those who still count calories.Betty Crocker's Diabetes Cookbook is also packed with expert medical and nutrition tips from Dr. Richard Bergenstal, an endocrinologist and diabetes doctor, and two registered nurses--invaluable for the newly diagnosed as well as for those who have been coping with diabetes for years. Throughout the book, real-life advice from people who have diabetes offers inspiration and great ideas on dealing with this chronic disease. When it comes to eating and living with diabetes, people need guidance and advice they can trust.",

        "Description": "\"Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and advertise!\"  These words of fatherly advice helped shape Ted Turner's remarkable life, but they only begin to explain the colorful, energetic, and unique style that has made Ted into one of the most amazing personalities of our time. Along the way - among his numerous accomplishments --  Ted became one of the richest men in the world, the largest land owner in the United States, revolutionized the television business with the creation of TBS and CNN, became a champion sailor and winner of the America's Cup, and took home a World Series championship trophy in 1995 as owner of the Atlanta Braves.  An innovative entrepreneur, outspoken nonconformist, and groundbreaking philanthropist, Ted Turner is truly a living legend, and now, for the first time, he reveals his personal story. From his difficult childhood to the successful launch of his media empire to the catastrophic AOL/Time Warner deal, Turner spares no details or feelings and takes the reader along on a wild and sometimes bumpy ride. You'll also hear Ted's personal take on how we can save the world...share his experiences in the dugout on the day when he appointed himself as manager of the Atlanta Braves....learn how he almost lost his life in the 1979 Fastnet sailing race (but came out the winner)...and discover surprising details about his dealings with Fidel Castro, Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Bill Gates, Jack Welch, Warren Buffett, and many more of the most influential people of the past half century.  Ted also doesn't shrink from the darker and more intimate details of his life. With his usual frankness, he discusses a childhood of loneliness (he was left at a boarding school by his parents at the tender age of four), and the emotional impact of devastating losses (Ted's beloved sister died at seventeen and his hard-charging father committed suicide when Ted was still in his early twenties). Turner is also forthcoming about his marriages, including the one to Oscar-winning actress, Jane Fonda.  Along the way, Ted's friends, colleagues, and family are equally revealing in their unique \"Ted Stories\" which are peppered throughout the book. Jane Fonda, especially, provides intriguing insights into Ted's inner drive and character.   In CALL ME TED, you'll hear Ted Turner's distinctive voice on every page. Always forthright, he tells you what makes him tick and what ticks him off, and delivers an honest account of what he's all about. Inspiring and entertaining, CALL ME TED sheds new light on one of the greatest visionaries of our time.",

        "Authors": "By Gormley, Beatrice and Henderson, Meryl (ILT)",
        "Description": "From the distinguished historian of Revolutionary-era America and author of the acclaimed American Scripture comes this fresh and surprising account of a pivotal moment in American history\u2014the ratification of the Constitution. \u2022 A singularly important debate: When the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia adjourned in the late summer of 1787, the delegates returned to their states to report on the new Constitution, which had to be ratified by specially elected conventions in at least nine states. Maier recounts the dramatic events of the ensuing debate in homes, taverns, and convention halls, drawing generously on the speeches and letters of founding fathers, both familiar and forgotten, on all sides. \u2022 Perfect match of author and subject: Pauline Maier specializes in bringing early American history to vivid life. Her most recent book, American Scripture, was an Editor\u2019s Choice of The New York Times Book Review and a finalist in general nonfiction for the National Book Critics Circle award.  \u2022 A new perspective: This is the first narrative history in decades of the ratification debate, with all its significance, and it draws on new scholarship about the ratification process. In Maier\u2019s skillful hands, this fascinating yet often-overlooked episode in the nation\u2019s history comes to life as never before. Praise for Pauline Maier\u2019s American Scripture :",
