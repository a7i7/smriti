        "Authors": "By Collins, Brandilyn",
        "Description": "Torn from the front lines of medical debate and the author's own experience with Lyme Disease, Over the Edge is riveting fiction, full of twists and turns\u2014and powerful truths about today's medical field.\u00a0\u00a0Janessa McNeil\u2019s husband, Dr. Brock McNeil, a researcher and professor at Stanford University's Department of Medicine, specializes in tick-borne diseases\u2014especially Lyme. For years he has insisted that Chronic Lyme Disease doesn't exist. Even as patients across the country are getting sicker, the committee Brock chairs is about to announce its latest findings\u2014which will further seal the door shut for Lyme treatment.\u00a0\u00a0One embittered man sets out to prove Dr. McNeil wrong by giving him a close-up view of the very disease he denies. The man infects Janessa with Lyme, then states his demand: convince her husband to publicly reverse his stand on Lyme\u2014or their young daughter will be next.\u00a0But Janessa's marriage is already rocky. She's so sick she can hardly move or think. And her husband denies she has Lyme at all.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Welcome to the Lyme wars, Janessa.Endorsements/Reviews:\" . . . a taut, heartbreaking thriller . . . Collins is a fine writer who knows how to both horrify readers and keep them turning pages. She'll gain new readers with this one . . .\"Publishers Weekly\"Over the Edge provides validation to any person who suffers from the long-term effects of Lyme Disease. While the story is based on Ms. Collins' own life experience, she builds a tense and dramatic novel that illustrates how a person can fall into the web of misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment.\"New York Journal of Books\"This book stayed with me long after I put it down. Not only was it a page-turner, but the storyline about Lyme Disease was fascinating and eye-opening. I think Over the Edge will raise awareness about this horrible disease, and validate those who suffer with it.\"Terri Blackstock, author of Predator and Intervention\"A frightening and all-too-real scenario. Very timely and meaningful book.\" (4 stars)RT Book Reviews\"Over the Edge is an excellent mystery. [It] actively portrays the patient with the myriad symptoms seen in acute or chronic Lyme.\"Dr. Nick S. Harris, president/CEO, IGeneX, Inc.\"Brandilyn Collins continues to impress . . . From start to finish, Over the Edge is a fantastic, multi-faceted novel.\"The Christian Manifesto\"Five stars! Highly recommended: A real life witch-hunt scarier than any vampire or zombie tale . . . the parts of the book laying out spiritual phenomena were excellent, indeed among the best I've read.\"Your Shelf Life\"Thrilling medical suspense . . . Over the Edge pits science against truth and will render readers shocked at what they learn.\"Fresh Fiction\"Deep characters, an amazing plot . . . an absolute must read.\"Read Great Fiction\"In this thrilling tale of vengeance . . . the pace is relentless, the suspense ramping up to greater levels as the pages fly by.\"Mysterious Reviews\"The suspense is great! Reading a fictional tale about what every maligned, marginalized, and misunderstood Lyme patient has dreamt about in their darkest hours is such a huge mental come-uppance . . . a novel that hits a bull's eye in safely channeling the frustrations of the entire community of Lyme patients.\"SpiroChicks.com\"This is my first Collins book; however it won't be my last! Her warm writing, true-to-life characterizations, compelling plot lines and taut suspense have made me a fan!\"The Suspense Zone",

They buy a Victorian mansion that once served as a haven for unwed mothers, called a birthing house.  One day when Joanna is away, the previous owner visits Conrad to bequeath a vital piece of the house's historic heritage, a photo album that he claims \"belongs to the house.\"  Thumbing through the old, sepia-colored photographs of midwives and fearful, unhappily pregnant girls in their starched, nineteenth-century dresses, Conrad is suddenly chilled to the bone: staring back at him with a countenance of hatred and rage is the image of his own wife\u2026.Thus begins a story of possession, sexual obsession, and, ultimately, murder, as a centuries-old crime is reenacted in the present, turning Conrad and Joanna's American dream into a relentless nightmare.",

With warmth and humor, she coaches readers on managing time, storing food, and respecting budgets; helps them navigate the most common danger zones at school for unhealthy eating; and shows them how to get the exercise they need, even in a tiny dorm room. She also offers invaluable tips on vitamins and supplements, and simple, effective ways to relax and rejuvenate right on campus, so students can stay mentally as well as physically fit.The Dorm Room Diet is a winning combination of the author's personal story and practical strategies that empower young women to use their newfound independence to create a healthy lifestyle while in college\u2014and for life.Daphne Oz's 8-step program for looking good, feeling great, and keeping fit in college:Step 1: Get InspiredStep 2: Get Informed: The Frosh 15Step 3: Get Started: Healthy Eating 101Step 4: Get a Grip: Where and How to Eat Responsibly at CollegeStep 5: Get Prepared: The Five Danger Zones and How to Survive ThemStep 6: Get Moving: The Exercise FactorStep 7: Get Your Vitamins: Everything You Need to Know About SupplementsStep 8: Get Recharged: A More Relaxed, More Effective You",

Although the play is a romantic comedy, Shakespeare offers some serious and thought-provoking dramatic fare before fulfilling the promise of the title.In the fine tradition of the Bard's plucky heroines, All's Well That Ends Well concerns Helena, the daughter of a renowned physician, and her dauntless passion for the elusive Bertram, Count of Rousillon. Risking her very life for the opportunity to choose Bertram as her husband, Helena's bid for Bertram's hand turns out to be only the beginning of a series of trials and tribulations. Finally, at the end of a comic maze of mistaken identities, betrayals, repentance, and dramatic revelations, Helena's efforts to corral her unwilling lover achieve joyful fulfillment.An ambiguous work in which mirthful entertainment is interwoven with a powerful subtext condemning class prejudice, this play possesses a singular combination of amusement and profundity that has intrigued scholars and theatergoers for four centuries.",
