        "Description": "Can an old betrayal turn into a brandnew beginning? National bestselling author Joan Medlicott pens a heartwarming tale of a family found.   Widowed Amelia always portrayed her marriage to Thomas Declose as complete perfection. They lived in Paris and entertained widely for a glittering crowd; only the tragic loss of their little girl marred what appeared an ideal existence. So when Miriam Smith arrives with her daughter Sadie on Amelia's doorstep in a snowstorm, claiming to be the illegitimate child of the long-dead Thomas, Amelia reacts with shock and fury. Could Thomas possibly have had a secret life he hid from her -- a life that would have made their marriage vows a lie?   Rebuffing the wise counsel of her housemates, Grace and Hannah, Amelia dismisses the possibility of a family of her own and buries herself in the pain of betrayal and humiliation. Little Sadie is the spitting image of Amelia's own lost daughter, though, and she cannot help taking mother and child into her heart. But danger stalks Miriam, and it looks as if Amelia might lose this family, too. When Mother's Day arrives, will she be left with empty arms...or with her deepest longings fulfilled?   This beautiful tale of mothers and daughters is an enchanting addition to Joan Medlicott's USA Today bestselling Covington books.",

Anne has never married and hasn't seen Ben since---until his nephew turns up in her high school and starts applying to college.      Now Ben is a successful writer, a world traveler, and a soon-to-be married man; and Winnie's health is beginning to fail. All of these changes have Anne beginning to wonder\u2026Can old love be rekindled, or are past mistakes too painful to forget?

        "Authors": "By Bawer, Bruce",
        "Description": "From the author of the widely acclaimed A Place at the Table, this is a major work, passionately outspoken and cogently reasoned, that exposes the great danger posed to Christianity today by fundamentalism.The time is past, says Bruce Bawer, when denominational names and other traditional labels provided an accurate reflection of Christian America's religious beliefs and practices. The meaningful distinction today is not between Protestant and Catholic, or Baptist and Episcopalian, but rather between \"legalistic\" and \"nonlegalistic\" religion, between the Church of Law and the Church of Love. On one side is the fundamentalist right, which draws a sharp distinction between \"saved\" and \"unsaved\" and worships a God of wrath and judgment; on the other are more mainstream Christians who view all humankind as children of a loving God who calls them to break down barriers of hate, prejudice, and distrust.Pointing out that the supposedly \"traditional\" beliefs of American fundamentalism--about which most mainstream Christians, clergy included, know shockingly little--are in fact of relatively recent origin, are distinctively American in many ways, and are dramatically at odds with the values that Jesus actually spread, Bawer fascinatingly demonstrates the way in which these beliefs have increasingly come to supplant genuinely fundamental Christian tenets in the American church and to become synonymous with Christianity in the minds of many people.Stealing Jesus is the ringing testament of a man who is equally disturbed by the notion of an America without Christianity and the notion of an American Christianity without love and compassion.",

Throughout, the author places current research in historical perspective, and identifies major ideas and themes that have emerged in recent years in order to provide a solid foundation for future investigations.  The book is amply illustrated and contains a useful glossary.  It will be of use in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on memory, and to psychologists and neuroscientists desiring an account of memory that is informed equally by cognitive and neurobiological insights.",

        "Description": "In the twenty years since the publication of The Complete Book of Breads new equipment and products have revolutionized the kitchen. With a food processor, or a heavy-duty mixer equipped with a dough hook, a home-baked loaf can be produced in a fraction of the time previously required, and with little effort as well. The easy availability of fast-acting yeasts, bread flora, and other specialty products has also broadened the possibilities.  These changes were part of the inspiration for the much-needed New Camplete Book of Breads; 200 of the recipes from the original book appear here, all revised with the modern cook, modern equipment, and marvelous products in mind. Beyond the updated recipes, master baker Bernard Clayton also includes 100 new recipes, which are the result of ongoing research, further travels, and the generosity of fans and friends. For each recipe, Clayton also gives instructions for using either the mixer or the food processor and takes into account the shorter time needed for fast-acting yeasts.  The New Complete Book of Breads offers an incredible range of variety, nearly, enough to supply a different kind of bread for a year of baking days. Here are wheat breads -- Honey-Lemon, Walnut, Buttermilk; a variety of sourdough breads; all manner of corn breads; breads flavored with herbs and spices or enriched with cheeses; and all the favorite \"little\" breads -- Kaiser Rolls, Mother's Biscuits, English Muffins, and Popovers. For the baker who observes the seasons and the holidays with a fresh loaf, there are Challah, Barm Brack, and Panettone; there are also delectable breads rich with nuts and fruits, such as Cherry-Pecan, Italian Olive, and Honey-Pineapple.  Here is the ultimate bread book, an indispensable reference for professional bakers and home cooks alike.",

        "Description": "Determine your personality using a scientifically validated method based on the work of C.G. Jung and gain insight into why others behave the way they do, and why you are the person you are.\u00a0What\u2019s your type? Would you rather . . .  . . . celebrate with the whole crowd or just a few friends? . . . focus on the facts or get an overall impression? . . . go with what \u201cseems logical\u201d or what \u201cfeels fair\u201d? . . . keep to a schedule or keep your options open? \u00a0 How you answer these questions is the very beginning of understanding who you are and how you relate to those around you, by using a new and exciting method called Typewatching. Otto Kroeger and Janet M. Thuesen have developed Typewatching from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which was derived from the work of C. G. Jung. Now they have put together the first and only popular guide to the MBTI in Type Talk. Here is a one-of-a-kind guide that describes this scientifically validated approach to \u201cname-calling,\u201d a method that has been used for more than forty years by individuals, families, corporations, and governments who want to communicate better. Typewatching as explained in Type Talk is easy to learn and natural to use. With even moderate practice it can help teachers teach and students learn, workers work and bosses boss. It can help lovers love, parents parent, and everyone accept themselves and others more easily. Best of all, Typewatching is fun. \u00a0 Type Talk examines the four pairs of preferences that are fundamental to every personality type: Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/iNtuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. Kroeger and Thuesen provide a self-evaluation that can be used to determine which of each of these preferences best describes you. They delineate every combination of preferences\u2014there are 16 different personality types, so you are sure to find yourself\u2014and they go on to demonstrate how to analyze and evaluate other people as well. Once armed with this knowledge, you will learn how to thrive in a world of so many different types. Here is a celebration of the similarities and differences in people, an odyssey of discovery in which the final destination is success, satisfaction, and serenity.",

        "Description": "The rapid growth of behavior therapy over the past 20 years has been well doc\u00ad umented. Yet the geometric expansion of the field has been so great that it deserves to be recounted. We all received our graduate training in the mid to late 1960s. Courses in behavior therapy were then a rarity. Behavioral training was based more on informal tutorials than on systematic programs of study. The behavioral literature was so circumscribed that it could be easily mastered in a few months of study. A mere half-dozen books (by Wolpe, Lazarus, Eysenck, Ullmann, and Krasner) more-or-Iess comprised the behavioral library in the mid- 1960s. Semirial works by Ayllon and Azrin, Bandura, Franks, and Kanfer in 1968 and 1969 made it only slightly more difficult to survey the field. Keeping abreast of new developments was not very difficult, as Behaviour Research and Therapy and the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis were the only regular outlets for behavioral articles until the end of the decade, when Behavior Therapy and Be\u00ad havior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry first appeared. We are too young to be maudlin, but \"Oh for the good old days!\" One of us did a quick survey of his bookshelves and stopped counting books with behavior or behavioral in the titles when he reached 100. There were at least half again as many behavioral books without those words in the title.",

First there were her acclaimed Victorian mysteries, sparkling with passion and suspense. Now readers have embraced this bestselling new series of World War I novels\u2013which juxtapose the tranquil life of the English countryside with the horrors of war.By April of 1915, as chaplain Joseph Reavley tends to the soldiers in his care, the nightmare of trench warfare is impartially cutting down England\u2019s youth. On one of his rescue forays into no-man\u2019s-land, Joseph finds the body of an arrogant war correspondent, Eldon Prentice. A nephew of the respected General Owen Cullingford, Prentice was despised for his prying attempts to elicit facts that would turn public opinion against the war. Most troublesome to Joseph, Prentice has been killed not by German fire but, apparently, by one of his own compatriots. What Englishman hated Prentice enough to kill him? Joseph is afraid he may know, and his sister, Judith, who is General Cullingford\u2019s driver and translator, harbors her own fearful suspicions.Meanwhile, Joseph and Judith\u2019s brother, Matthew, an intelligence officer in London, continues his quiet search for the sinister figure they call the Peacemaker, who, like Eldon Prentice, is trying to undermine the public support for the struggle\u2013and, as the Reavley family has good reason to believe, is in fact at the heart of a fantastic plot to reshape the entire world. An intimate of kings, the Peacemaker kills with impunity, and his dark shadow stretches from the peaceful country lanes of Cambridgeshire to the twin hells of Ypres and Gallipoli.In this mesmerizing series, Anne Perry has found a subject worthy of her gifts. Illuminating the murderous conflict whose violence still resounds in our consciousness\u2013as well as the souls of men and women who lived it\u2013Shoulder the Sky is a taut, inspiring masterpiece.",

        "Title": "10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed America (History Channel Presents)",
        "Authors": "By Gillon, Steven M.",
        "Description": "A companion book to The History Channel\u00ae special series of ten one-hour documentaries10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed America pinpoints pivotal days that transformed our nation. For the series and the book, The History Channel challenged a panel of leading historians, including author Steven M. Gillon, to come up with some less well-known but historically significant events that triggered change in America. Together, the days they chose tell a story about the great democratic ideals upon which our country was built.  You won\u2019t find July 4, 1776, for instance, or the attack on Fort Sumter that ignited the Civil War, or the day Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon. But January 25, 1787, is here. On that day, the ragtag men of Shays\u2019 Rebellion attacked the federal arsenal in Springfield, Massachusetts, and set the new nation on the path to a strong central government. January 24, 1848, is also on the list. That\u2019s when a carpenter named John Marshall spotted a few glittering flakes of gold in a California riverbed. The discovery profoundly altered the American dream. Here, too, is the day that noted pacifist Albert Einstein unwittingly advocated the creation of the Manhattan Project, thus setting in motion a terrible chain of events.  Re-creating each event with vivid immediacy, accessibility, and historical accuracy, 10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed America comes together as a history of our country, from the first colonists\u2019 contact with Native Americans to the 1960s. It is a snapshot of our country as we were, are, and will be.",

        "Description": "Neoconservatism is the movement that has provided the intellectual foundation for the resurgence of American conservatism in our time. And if neoconservatism can be said to have a father or an architect, that person is Irving Kristol.Neoconservatism is the most comprehensive selection of Kristol's influential writings on politics and economics, as well as the best of his now-famous essays on society, religion, culture, literature, education, and - above all - the \"values\" issues that have come to define the neo-conservative critique of contemporary life.These essays provide an unparalleled insight into the 50-year development of Kristol's social and political ideas, from an uneasy socialism tempered with religious orthodoxy, to a vigilant optimism about the future of the American experiment. Those already familiar with Kristol's work will especially enjoy the new autobiographical essay that introduces this volume; it is sprinkled with personal recollections about such luminaries as Lionel Trilling, Leo Strauss, Saul Bellow, Sidney Hook, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and historian Gertrude Himmelfarb (who is also Mrs. Kristol). Those relatively new to Kristol's writings will be treated to some of the most lucid, insightful, entertaining, and intellectually challenging essays of our time.",
