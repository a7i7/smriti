As the seconds-in-command to the aging Regent, Regis Hastur, and his consort Linnea, life in Comyn Castle for Marguerida and Mikhail is far from serene.But the real root of the current tensions on Darkover has more to do with the Terran Federation than anything internal to Darkover. The once pleasant relationship between Darkover's ruling families and the Terran envoys to Darkover has been shattered, primarily due to the machinations of Lyle Belfontaine, the corrupt and ambitious Station Chief at Federation Headquaters.When the sudden death of Regis Hastur leaves Comyn Council in turmoil, Belfontaine sees an opportunity to wrest by force what he could not gain through diplomacy, and plans a violent takeover on Darkover.Can Mikhail and Marguerida, new Regent and consort on Darkover, face the might of Terran weapons with only their combined telepathic laran powers?",

I'm tired of politicians using the crime problem as an excuse for seizing property and liberties from innocent citizens. And I'm not fooled by \"welfare reform\" that doesn't change anything, or by showy \"spending cuts\" that add up to a bigger government budget.As a lifelong libertarian, I'm running for president with a simple platform: We can have higher incomes, safer cities, better schools, and a more civil society if we reduce the size of government drastically - rather than just slowing its growth. This book presents a realistic plan for cutting government, and it shows how you can make me keep my promises if elected.",

In this masterful new novel, the killer may very well be the one you sympathize with the most....THE FIRST RULE IS NEVER BLAME THE VICTIM.They survived what no woman should ever have to endure. Now these three women have the means, the opportunity, and the perfect motive. Are they trying to get away with murder--or is someone trying to make sure that this time they don\u2019t get away at all? The Survivors Club. . .that\u2019s what Jillian Hayes, Carol Rosen, and Meg Pesaturo call it. They won\u2019t consider themselves victims. They are survivors. They faced the blazing headlines and helped lead the investigation that caught the man who changed their lives forever. And now that Eddie Como, the College Hill rapist, has been murdered, shot down outside a packed courthouse moments before his trial was about to begin, all three women are openly ecstatic that he\u2019s dead. They are also the prime suspects in his murder. Detective Sergeant Roan Griffin knows all too well what can drive even the best people to cross the line. But he has never seen a case quite like this one. No one doubts that the murder of Eddie Como was a professional job, especially when the gunman is killed only blocks away from the shooting. But questions taunt Griffin: Who ordered the deaths of Eddie Como and his killer? Could three ordinary women have been driven to do he unthinkable? Had someone in the Survivors Club become a killer? Griffin seeks the truth--and finds himself confronted with the leader of the Survivors Club. Jillian Hayes is beautiful, successful, cool as ice, and she harbors a pain that mirrors Griffin\u2019s own. Did the horror of what happened to her push her over the thin and desperate line that separates survival and revenge? And if it did, could he blame her--or anyone in the Survivors Club? Then another woman is brutally attacked. Suddenly, with the city on the ragged edge of panic, gripped in a media and political firestorm of controversy, cover-up, and conspiracy, the hunt is on for a ruthless and cunning killer. For Griffin, this may well be the case that shatters his career. For Jillian, the harrowing nightmare is beginning all over again. Someone is out there. Someone who wants to finish what was started. Someone who wants to make sure that no one survives the Survivors Club.",

        "Title": "American Gunfight: The Plot to Kill Harry Truman--and the Shoot-out that Stopped It",
        "Authors": "By Hunter, Stephen and Bainbridge, John, Jr.",
        "Description": "American Gunfight is the fast-paced, definitive, and breathtakingly suspenseful account of an extraordinary historical event -- the attempted assassination of President Harry Truman in 1950 by two Puerto Rican Nationalists and the bloody shoot-out in the streets of Washington, D.C., that saved the president's life.Written by Pulitzer Prize-winner Stephen Hunter, the widely admired and bestselling novelist and author of such books as Havana, Hot Springs, and Dirty White Boys, and John Bainbridge, Jr., an experienced journalist and lawyer, American Gunfight is at once a groundbreaking work of meticulous historical research and the vivid and dramatically told story of an act of terrorism that almost succeeded. They have pieced together, at last, the story of the conspiracy that nearly doomed the president and how a few good men -- ordinary guys who were willing to risk their lives in the line of duty -- stopped it.It is a book about courage -- on both sides -- and about what politics and devotion to a cause can lead men to do, and about what actually happens, second by second, when a gunfight explodes.It begins on November 1, 1950, an unseasonably hot afternoon in the sleepy capital. At 2:00 P.M. in his temporary residence at Blair House, the president of the United States takes a nap. At 2:20 P.M., two men approach Blair House from different directions. Oscar Collazo, a respected metal polisher and family man, and Griselio Torresola, an unemployed salesman, don't look dangerous, not in their new suits and hats, not in their calm, purposeful demeanor, not in their slow, unexcited approach. What the three White House policemen and one Secret Service agent cannot guess is that under each man's coat is a 9mm German automatic pistol and in each head, a dream of assassin's glory.At point-blank range, Collazo and then Torresola draw and fire and move toward the president of the United States.Hunter and Bainbridge tell the story of that November day with narrative power and careful attention to detail. They are the first to report on the inner workings of this conspiracy; they examine the forces that led the perpetrators to conceive the plot. The authors also tell the story of the men themselves, from their youth and the worlds in which they grew up to the women they loved and who loved them to the moment the gunfire erupted. Their telling commemorates heroism -- the quiet commitment to duty that in some moments of crisis sees some people through an ordeal, even at the expense of their lives.",

        "Authors": "By Eickelman, Christine",
        "Description": "Before 1970 Oman was one of teh more isolated countries on the Arab peninsula.  The growth of the oil economy during the seventies, however, has brought rapid change to the small towns and villages that make up the country. In Women and Community in Oman Chritine Eickelman captures the tone and feel of this desert culture on the verge of substantial, and probably irreversible, change.  During 1979 and 1980 she lived in Hamra, an oasis of 2,500 persons and the capital of the Abriyin tribe.  Situated on the western edge of the Jabal al-Akhdar region of inner Oman, this was formerly one of the most inaccessible areas of the peninsula.  Eickelman lived there among the people of Hamra, visiting Omani, this was formerly one of the most inaccessible areas of the peninsula.  Eickelman lived there among the people of Hamra, visiting Omani homes, and speaking daily with the men and women - especially the women.  The result is a lively and very personal firsthand account of day-to-day life in the Omani interior. The book looks at the practical changes in the life of the Omanis, and at the roles, concerns, and aspirations of the women there.  Eickelman explores key concepts in the Omani community and family life, from choosing a spouse and \"negotiating\" a marriage to giving birth and raising children; from work and status within the community to rituals, mores and sociability in the neighborhood. Eickelman's study stands as a discriminateing and sympathetic view of a sturdily independent culture.  This perceptive and informative account will be of lasting importance and interest to Middle East specialists, anthroupoligists, those concerned with women's studies, and to al persons who want to learn more about the implications of political and social change in the Third World.",

The survivors naturally assumed that they had fallen victim to an allied submarine, but they were wrong.U-boat commander Hans-Joachim Schwantke had had an unlucky war and was desperate to open his score. Assuming, on scant evidence, that the Doggerbank was an allied ship he sent her to the bottom and then turned away from the survivors, in all probability by now aware that he had made a tragic mistake and anxious to escape from the evidence. But the evidence remained, in the shape of just one man. Of the 365 men on board, alone of those who survived the sinking and managed to reach a life raft or dinghy only Fritz Kuert was to survive to tell his tale.Thanks to Hans Herlin's research, and the translating skills of John Brownjohn, the amazing story of Kuert's journey across the Atlantic, of his rescue and his vain struggle to establish the truth has at last been told.",

        "Description": "A bitingly funny grand tour of our culture of excess\u00a0from an award-winning humorist.Whether\u00a0David Rakoff\u00a0is contrasting the elegance of one of the last flights of the supersonic Concorde with the good-times-and-chicken-wings populism of Hooters Air; working as a cabana boy at a South Beach hotel; or traveling to a private island off the coast of Belize to watch a soft-core video shoot\u2014where he is provided with his very own personal manservant\u2014rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly skewered. Somewhere along the line, our healthy self-regard has exploded into obliterating narcissism; our manic getting and spending have now become celebrated as moral virtues. Simultaneously a Wildean satire\u00a0and a plea for a little human decency, Don\u2019t Get Too Comfortable shows that far from being bobos in paradise, we\u2019re in a special circle of gilded-age hell.",

Or puzzled at how her friends are aging prematurely? I'm Too Young to Be This Old shows women how to face their changing lives with a spirit of fun and fearlessness. With plenty of humor, it leads them through both the lighter side of midlife and the deeper issues that concern them, including erratic emotions, wondering if the best of life is over, changes in health and appearance, aging parents, reentry into the workplace, and more.",

        "Authors": "By Truman, Margaret",
        "Description": "Congressman Latham has maintained an impeccable record in Washington, and so he seems the logical choice when nominated by his friend, President Scott, to become the next secretary of state. His confirmation hearings appear to be a formality until rumors emerge of sexual misconduct and influence peddling. Then, early one morning, he is found shot to death, an apparent suicide.Nobody close to Paul Latham believes his demise a suicide; there are just too many questions left unanswered. Why would he kill himself, and why would he do it in a public place? Why was there no suicide note? Where did he get the gun? Where is Latham's appointment secretary, Marge Edwards? So Latham's close friend lawyer-professor Mackensie Smith goes about uncovering the truth. In the process he unearths connections to the CIA, businessman Warren Brazier, Russian communists, and a shady private detective. Eventually Smith's own life is threatened, leading him to a dramatic and shocking truth.Murder in the House is a story about the webs of influence people weave to protect their interests, and about those innocent people who, by accident or design, get caught in these webs. It is the story of the abuse of power for personal gain, and of the increasing influence that the global economy has on the way our nation is being run.",
