        "Description": "Jesus Didn\u2019t Invite the World to Come to Church. He Commanded the Church to Go into the World.But do we really understand what he meant? Not if our actions mean anything. Instead of going into the world, we run from it. Some of us hold it at arm\u2019s length, some of us fight it, some of us conform to it, and others of us grow complacent toward it. But few of us know what it means to actually love the world with the kind of passionate, visionary love that sent Jesus from the heights of holiness into the depths of a sin-sick culture.In Too Christian, Too Pagan, Dick Staub calls us to communicate the Gospel in the most risky, satisfying, and compelling way possible: by living an unpretentious faith amid the perils and promise of our society. It\u2019s not about handing out tracts or organizing rallies. It\u2019s about following Christ out of our comfort zones into places we\u2019d never expect, getting as close to sinners and their lives as Jesus himself wants to get. Not everyone will approve. To some, we\u2019ll seem too Christian; to others, too pagan. But the One whose opinion truly matters will be glorified as we enter not just into his ways and means, but his very heart.",

He says humbug to the Christmas tradtitions and trappings that make the holiday memorable.

It's a very personal look at what's wrong with Christmas, seen through the eyes of \"the most engagingly pissed-off comedian ever.\"*         From his own Christmas rituals?which have absolutely nothing to do with presents or the Christmas tree or Rudolph?to his own eccentric experiences with the holiday (from a USO Christmas tour to playing Santa Claus in full regalia), I'm Dreaming of a Black Christmas is classic Lewis Black: funny, razor-sharp, insightful, and honest.

Or know quite what to do with them? Painless Fractions was written especially for middle-school students, but can be helpful to just about everybody. (Let's face it: we all make occasional mistakes with fractions.) The author takes a light-hearted approach to teaching fractions. She defines all terms, then demonstrates the correct methods of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractions, and shows how to convert them into decimals. Puns, puzzles, and \"brain ticklers\" add an element of fun to the process of mastering fractions. There are answers to all questions, and plenty of good advice for avoiding pitfalls when calculating with fractions.",

        "Description": "Could you use a touch of joy? Joy is your birthright as a child of the God who delights in you and celebrates your existence. God approves of joy. It is what he made you for. Yet we live in a world at war against gladness. From our relationships, to our careers, to our health, to our hopes and dreams, a conspiracy of sorrow seeks to steal the joy that the Bible says is our strength. Life\u2019s struggles are real. But so is God\u2019s kingdom and his intention to fill our hearts to overflowing. In the midst of the daily grind, even in the face of heartbreak and mourning, joy is just a choice away.In thirty-one sensitive, insightful devotions, Dr. Charles Stanley explores the nature of joy through the lens of Scripture. In his personal, straightforward style, he speaks to the stuff of life we all contend with and shows us the Bible\u2019s path toward the heart of joy. Whether we\u2019re dealing with anger, or unforgiveness, or loss, or disappointment, God is able to turn our circumstances into gateways of blessing. Often, the blessing lies in getting God\u2019s perspective, not ours. A Touch of His Joy shifts our focus to the character and purposes of the One who stores our tears in a bottle, and in his own time, uses them to refract the light of his love into rainbows of blessing that delight our soul.Filled with beautiful, black-and-white photographs taken by the author in the Rocky Mountains, this devotional contemplates the joy that fills the creation Dr. Stanley\u2019s camera so poignantly captures. A Touch of His Joy will touch you with joy, as you discover God\u2019s multifaceted love for you in the ups and downs of life.",

The truth is that Fromkin's outline is persuasively thought out and presented.\"--The Washington Post Book WorldAs the human race approaches the 21st century, questions of our past trouble us as much as those that concern our future. How did we get here? Where--and how--did Homo sapiens originate? How did we, precariously bipedal, come to dominate the animal kingdom, direct the flow of the Euphrates, fly a rocket to the moon?David Fromkin, author of A Peace to End All Peace and finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critic Circle Award, provides an arrestingly cogent answer inThe Way of the World. With insight and sound scholarship, he reveals how human culture has evolved according to the principles of self-determination--from the footsteps of the first hominids 3.5 million years ago to the efforts of contemporary democracies' to establish a global, lasting peace. Here is a world history wherein early forms of Christianity give way to rationalism, the tyranny of kings crumbles to the merits of representative government, and modern science presents us with the master key to the future. Refreshingly positive, David Fromkin reminds us of the astounding record of human achievement, and the potential in each of us to improve the way of our world.\"Mr. Fromkin recounts 'the greatest story ever told' exceedingly well, aided by a deep knowledge and an elegant prose style.\"--The Wall Street Journal\"The Way of the World is worldly, civilized, genial.\"--The Boston Globe",

The result is a report of what really happened from the heart of the action unlike anything you\u2019ll read anywhere else.\u201cWhile we will move swiftly and aggressively against those who resist, we will treat all others with decency, demonstrating chivalry and soldierly compassion for people who have endured a lifetime under Saddam\u2019s oppression.\u201d\u2014Major General J.N. Mattis, 1st Marine Division, CommandingHere is the story that can be told only by those who actually witnessed the action of the famed 1st Marine Division\u2019s march on Baghdad, from the shaky beginning of U.S. operations in southern Iraq to the capture of U.S. prisoners, the misreported \u201cfierce Iraqi resistance,\u201d and the aggressive assaults that led to a quick and decisive victory.With over a half century of military and combat experience between them, bestselling author F. J. \u201cBing\u201d West and Major General Ray L. Smith, USMC (Ret.), combine expert military analysis with dramatic battlefield reporting. They bring the reader on a march that ended in victory\u2014but was shadowed by second-guessing, unexpected reversals, and the threat of catastrophe.With access to three-star generals in the command centers and to privates in the field, the authors reveal how the strategic plan played out in battle, showing what went well and what failed, and detailing power struggles for military and political control never reported. The result is destined to become the definitive account of ground warfare in Iraq.From the Hardcover edition.",

She is the smartest and hardest-working marketing brain in the business - the kind of marketer who can sell \"ice sculptures to Eskimos.\" But her brilliant ideas aren't simply the result of random inspiration; they're the products of a systematic approach to marketing that any company -- large or small -- can adapt to achieve success. In RUBIES IN THE ORCHARD, she divulges her secrets for creating some of the world's most memorable and iconic brands, and the bull's-eye strategies to sell them.Resnick believes that every company can find \"rubies\" in its orchard, elements of intrinsic value that consumers will desire.  Here, she shows how every successful marketing campaign begins with uncovering these hidden gems, and communicating their value honestly and transparently to the consumer. Through Resnick's behind-the-scenes narrative, we learn the secrets of her extraordinary successes, including: POM Wonderful, the wildly popular 100% pomegranate juice that created an entirely new product category out of a fickle and obscure fruit; and FIJI Water, a fledgling brand she transformed into the #1 premium bottled water in America, with sales that have increased 300% since 2004.A born marketer, Resnick shares tales from a remarkable life, from opening her own ad agency at age 19 to the time she famously overpaid for Jackie Kennedy's pearls at auction, then transformed her \"mistake\" into tens of millions in sales for the Franklin Mint. Here for the first time, Resnick reveals her systematic approach to breaking through marketplace clutter and consumer cynicism, and creating blockbuster brands with true staying power.",

The book is replete with examples from the author\u2019s experience and from the history of the nuclear navy, where the price of failure can be death. \u00a0 Civilian managers will find that many of the principles discussed here can be employed with profit in private industry. The old school of motivation by coercion never accomplished much with submarine sailors, who are among the navy\u2019s elite, and the author has found that what works with this new breed of mariner-technician can be of enormous value in dealing with the members of an entrepreneurial organization.Praise for Lead On! \u201cA wealth of advice on military leadership that is also pertinent to civilian managers.\u201d\u2014The Retired Officer \u201cIt is a particular pleasure to see an officer from the \u2018silent service\u2019 publish his thoughts and viewpoints. In a light and breezy style . . . Admiral Oliver [expresses] some current thinking on critical issues.\u201d\u2014USNI Proceedings",
