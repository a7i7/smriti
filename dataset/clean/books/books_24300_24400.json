        "Title": "The Company: A Novel of the CIA",
        "Authors": "By Littell, Robert",
        "Description": "With a sharp eye for the pathos and absurdity of the Cold War, Robert Littell crafted his first novel, the now legendary spy thrillerThe Defection of A.J. Lewinter. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times called it \"a perfect little gem, the best Cold War thriller I've read in years,\" and the praise kept coming with critics hailing Littell as \"the American Le Carr\u00e9\" (New York Times) and raving that his books were \"as good as thriller writing gets\" (The Washington Post).For his fourteenth novel, Robert Littell creates an engrossing, multigenerational, wickedly nostalgic yet utterly candid saga, bringing to life through a host of characters-historical and imagined-the over 40 years of the CIA-\"the Company\" to insiders. At the heart of the novel is a stunningly conceived mole hunt involving such rivals and allies as the MI6, KGB, and Mossad.Racing across a canvas that spans the legendary Berlin Base in the 1950s-the front line of the simmering Cold War-to the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the Bay of Pigs, the Afghan war, the Gorbachev putsch, and other major theatres of operation for the CIA,The Company tells a thrilling story of agents imprisoned in double lives, fighting an enemy that was amoral, elusive, formidable.Littell tells it like it was: CIA agents, fighting not only the good fight, but sometimes the bad one as well. Littell also brilliantly lays bare the warring within the Company to add another dimension to the spy vs. spy game: the battles between the counterintelligence agents in Washington, like the utterly obsessive real-life mole hunter James Angleton, and the covert action boys in the field, likeThe Company's Harvey Torriti-the Sorcerer-a brilliant and brash rule breaker and dirty tricks expert who fights fire with fire, and his Apprentice, Jack McAuliffe, recruited fresh out of Yale, who learns tradecraft and the hard truths of life in the field.As this dazzling anatomy of the CIA unfolds, nothing less than the world's future in the second half of the twentieth century is at stake. At once a celebration of a long Cold War well fought, an elegy for the end of an era, and a reckoning for a profession in which moral ambiguity created a wilderness of mirrors, The Company is the Cold War's devastating truth, its entertaining tale, its last word.",

        "Authors": "By Lipsky, David",
        "Description": "Lipsky, a Rolling Stone writer and an award-winning novelist, chronicles daily life at the U.S. Military Academy during the most tumultuous period in its history.In 1998, West Point made David Lipsky an unprecedented offer: stay at the Academy as long as you like, go wherever you wish, talk to whomever you want, to discover why some of America's most promising young people sacrifice so much to become cadets. Lipsky followed one cadet class into mess halls, barracks, classrooms, bars, and training exercises, from arrival through graduation. By telling their stories, he also examines the Academy as a reflection of our society: Are its principles of equality, patriotism, and honor quaint anachronisms or is it still, as Theodore Roosevelt called it, the most \"absolutely American\" institution?During arguably the most eventful four years in West Point's history, Lipsky witnesses the arrival of TVs and phones in dorm rooms, the end of hazing, and innumerable other shifts in policy and practice known collectively as The Changes. He uncovers previously unreported scandals and poignantly evokes the aftermath of September 11, when cadets must prepare to become officers in wartime.Absolutely American spotlights a remarkable ensemble of characters: a former Eagle Scout who struggles with every facet of the program, from classwork to marching; a foul-mouthed party animal who hates the military and came to West Point to play football; a farm-raised kid who seems to be the perfect soldier, despite his affection for the early work of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe; and an exquisitely turned-out female cadet who aspires to \"a career in hair and nails\" after the Army. These cadets and their classmates are transformed in fascinating, sometimes astonishing, ways by one of America's most mythologized and least understood challenges. Many of them thrive under the rigorous regimen; others battle endlessly just to survive it. A few give up the fight altogether.Lipsky's extensive experience covering college students for Rolling Stone helped him gain an exceptional degree of trust and candor from both cadets and administrators. They offer frank insights on drug use, cheating, romance, loyalty, duty, patriotism, and the Army's tortuous search for meaning as new threats loom.",

India Taylor lived in a world of manicured lawns and neatly  maintained calendars: a merry-go-round of Little League, piano lessons, and Cape  Cod summer vacations. With four wonderful children, India believed in commitment  and sacrifice, just as she believed in Doug, the man she married 17 years before.  For India, this was the promise she made, the life she had chosen\u2014not the award-winning  career as a photojournalist she once had. It was a choice she had never truly regretted.  Until she begins to regret it with all her heart.  India couldn't pinpoint the exact  moment. Perhaps it was the last time her agent called, begging her to take an assignment  Doug insisted she turn down. Or perhaps it was when Doug told her he thought of her  as a companion and someone to take care of their kids, and not much more. At that  moment, the price of the sacrifices she'd made began to seem high.  And then, she  met Paul Ward. A Wall Street tycoon married to a bestselling author, Paul lived life  on his own terms, traveling the world on his own yacht. India hadn't planned to become  Paul's friend. Anything more was unthinkable. Yet talking to Paul was so easy. India  could share her dreams with him, and offer comfort when Paul suffers a heartbreak  of his own. And while Paul urges India to reclaim her career, Doug is adamantly against  it, determined to keep her tied to the home. But with Paul's encouragement, India  slowly, painfully, begins to break free, and find herself again.  Rediscovering her  creativity and her courage, India uses Paul like a beacon on the horizon, sharing  intimate phone conversations with a man half a world away, a man who never stops  reminding her of all that is possible for her. India is changing, and nothing in  her life will ever be the same again. Not her marriage. Not her friendship with Paul.  And when India is presented with an irresistible opportunity, she makes a heart-wrenching  decision, leaving a safe, familiar place-and the people she loves there-to move into  the terror of the unknown.  Bittersweet is her story, a story of freedom, of having  dreams and making choices to find them. With unerring insight, Danielle Steel has  created a moving portrait of a woman who dares to embark on a new adventure and the  man who helps her get there. Her painful, exhilarating journey inspires us all.",

Before long, you will find yourself eagerly turning the pages to find out what happens next.The Sacred Romance\u00a0strikes a chord in us because more than in any other age, we have lost touch with our hearts. We have left that essential part of ourselves behind in the pursuit of efficiency, success, and even Christian service.From childhood on, something or Someone has called us on a journey of the heart. It is a journey full of intimacy, adventure, and beauty, but like any fairy tale it is also fraught with more than a little danger. To ignore this whispered call is to become one of the living dead who carry on their lives divorced from their most intimate selves, their heart.\u00a0The Sacred Romance\u00a0calls to us in our fondest memories, our greatest loves, our noblest achievements, even our deepest hurts. The reward is worth the risk.",

It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the subject of forgiveness to the Christian faith. If the Bible makes it clear that Christians are forgiven people, it also makes it clear that we are to be forgiving people. How and when do we do that? What does it look like?",

But she has not missed the \"real\" world. Cat's life on the mountain has been wonderful. She adores her husband, who buttresses her against the world outside; she cherishes her country garden and her friends from the college. Montview has served her well.Now, for the first time, she and Joe have ventured out of their haven into the careening panorama of Italy to attend the Roman wedding of their Montview friends Colin and Maria. From Rome they will travel to Venice and on through the hill towns of Tuscany, where, Cat feels, she will be up high and safe again.But at first none of Italy seems safe to her. It is frantic and hot; its people seem totally alien, its raw sensuality terrifying. Gradually, however, Cat becomes enthralled by Italy's hectic beauty and vitality. She is seduced by everything: art and architecture, food and wine, the sheer living weight of its history. She burns to share it all with Joe, but as her old fear heals and she grows stronger, he seems to turn away from her. It is almost as if Italy diminishes Joe. The only person Cat feels real connection with is Sam Forrest, a celebrated and charismatic American painter who joins the four Southerners on the trip through the hill towns of Tuscany.As she has done in the past to great acclaim, Anne Rivers Siddons probes deeply into the multiple meanings of love and relationships refracted through the prism of a woman's eyes. Endowed with a marvelous Italian setting and rich, compelling characters, Hill Towns is a rare novel of depth and deliverance. It is the work of a gifted writer at the height of her storytelling powers.",

        "Description": "Master storyteller Peter Benchley combines high adventure with practical information in Shark Trouble, a book that is at once a thriller and a valuable guide to being safe in, on, under, and around the sea. The bestselling author of Jaws, The Deep, and other works draws on more than three decades of experience to share information about sharks and other marine animals.\u201cShark attacks on human beings generate a tremendous amount of media coverage,\u201d Benchley writes, \u201cpartly because they occur so rarely, but mostly, I think, because people are, and always have been, simultaneously intrigued and terrified by sharks. Sharks come from a wing of the dark castle where our nightmares live\u2014deep water beyond our sight and understanding\u2014and so they stimulate our fears and fantasies and imaginations.\u201dBenchley describes the many types of sharks (including the ones that pose a genuine threat to man), what is and isn\u2019t known about shark behavior, the odds against an attack and how to reduce them even further\u2014all reinforced with the lessons he has learned, the mistakes he has made, and the personal perils he has encountered while producing television documentaries, bestselling novels, and articles about the sea and its inhabitants. He tells how to swim safely in the ocean, how to read the tides and currents, what behavior to avoid, and how to survive when danger suddenly strikes. He discusses how to tell children about sharks and the sea and how to develop, in young and old alike, a healthy respect for the ocean.As Benchley says, \u201cThe ocean is the only alien and potentially hostile environment on the planet into which we tend to venture without thinking about the animals that live there, how they behave, how they support themselves, and how they perceive us. I know of no one who would set off into the jungles of Malaysia armed only with a bathing suit, a tube of suntan cream, and a book, and yet that\u2019s precisely how we approach the oceans.\u201d No longer. Not after you\u2019ve read Shark Trouble.",

        "Title": "Looking Backward (Dover Thrift Editions)",
        "Authors": "By Bellamy, Edward",
        "Description": "First published in 1888, Looking Backward was one of the most popular novels of its day. Translated into more than 20 languages, its utopian fantasy influenced such thinkers as John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen, Eugene V. Debs, and Norman Thomas. Writing from a 19th century perspective and poignantly critical of his own time, Bellamy advanced a remarkable vision of the future, including such daring predictions as the existence of radio, television, motion pictures, credit cards, and covered pedestrian malls.On the surface, the novel is the story of time-traveler Julian West, a young Bostonian who is put into a hypnotic sleep in the late 19th century, and awakens in the year 2000 in a socialist utopia. In conversations with the doctor who awakened him, he discovers a brilliantly realized vision of an ideal future, one that seemed unthinkable in his own century. Crime, war, personal animosity, and want are nonexistent. Equality of the sexes is a fact of life. In short, a messianic state of brotherly love is in effect.Entertaining, stimulating, and thought-provoking, Looking Backward, with its ingenious plot and appealing socialism, is a provocative study of human society as it is and as it might be.",

        "Title": "PAPERIE: The Art of Writing and Wrapping with Paper",
        "Authors": "By Niles, Bo",
        "Description": "Paper is sensuous. Think of the love letters of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Henri Matisse's Jazz cutouts, William Morris wallpaper, Samuel Pepys's journal....With its many textures, weights, weaves, colors, and designs, paper adds dimension to our lives. Paperie: The Art of Writing and Wrapping with Paper, written by Bo Niles in conjunction with Kate's Paperie, explores that dimension and widens our understanding of the role of paper throughout history and its importance in communicating with books, letters, cards, currency, wrapping paper, room decoration, and anything else you can imagine.  Paper is a gracious and hospitable medium; while it can easily be transformed through folding, cutting, printing, or tearing, it also has the power to transform through wrapping and decorating. Paperie documents our relationship with paper, describing its creation from wood fibers and cotton rags, the use of it in packaging and printing, and the way in which a simple sheet can inspire the imagination to artistic creativity. The first section of the book, \"Transforming Paper,\" describes the ways in which societies have adapted paper to their uses throughout history, most notably through writing, printing, and the creation of stationery, envelopes, greeting cards, books, and journals. The second section, \"Transformed by Paper,\" deals with the more artistic uses of paper and the ways in which it affects each surface to which it is applied, whether that surface is a box, lamp, wall, floor, kite, or banner. One of the most stylish ways paper can be used is in wrapping, and Paperie describes different folds and presentations, as well as how the Japanese tradition of gift-giving places more importance on the wrapping than the gift itself.  Like Holly Golightly's Tiffany's, Kate's Paperie has a remarkable atmosphere. Everything in the store is made from or used with paper, and the moment you enter you can tell something unique is happening there. It is a complete paper experience, from the corrugated cardboard walls all the way up to its paper accordion drop-ceiling -- rough sheets of multicolored papers line the walls, brightly designed handmade greeting cards await selection in circular carousels, handmade photo albums and journals lie in stacks, all begging to be caressed, fondled, and chosen for a special use. Paperie is the distillation of years of paper craft knowledge, creativity, and flair. It not only provides information on the best paper choices for each project, but it teaches new techniques for wrapping and decorating, and inspires the letter-writer, journal-keeper, and would-be artist in all of us.",

        "Description": "From Chris Matthews, host of MSNBC's Hardball, star of NBC's The Chris Matthews Show, and the New York Times bestselling author of Now, Let Me Tell You What I Really Think comes this celebration of the American Spirit.  Fiercely independent, in love with freedom, convinced we can make it, we are like no other people on earth. We are a people reluctant to fight who become ferocious warriors when threatened or attacked. We are suspicious of governmental power, yet quick to embrace our flag in times of danger. A deeply practical nation, we loom as the world's great optimists.  What unites us Americans is not so much language or ethnicity, but a set of distinct notions about ourselves that comprise our American-ness. The self-made country. The constant rebel. The reluctant warrior. The lone hero. The pioneer. The optimist. You see them all in the movies we make, the books we write, the history we have lived. What stirred the souls of our ancestors two centuries ago -- and all the generations in between -- still does.  In American, Matthews presents a portrait of a country that enters the world arena even today armed with an extremely potent weapon: the collective notions we carry of America at its best. We have saluted them in our popular culture, from The Great Gatsby to Casablanca to Rocky, and throughout our American history, from 1776 to 9/11. Matthews paints a picture of more than just a nation challenged but a people ready and eager to prevail.",

Until, on the very night of man's first moon landing, a precipitous passion alights on their middle-aged existence. Out for a stroll, Norris Lamb--postmaster, stamp collector, and church organist--spies spinster Vida Stephen dancing with glorious, uncharacteristic abandon by the moonlit fountain of the mansion where she tends the mute, retarded son of an absent employer. Norris senses a buried bravado and romance, a fragility and loneliness, that match his own. And he sets out, covertly, to woo her.But both Norris and Vida are innocents in this endeavor. His courtship blunders down many wrong turns before it finds its unlooked-for catalyst in Manford, the gentle young man who is Vida's charge...and blossoms as a force to change three lives.In luminous prose laced with quiet humor, Lamb in Love shows how love transforms the most ordinary and imperfect mortals.Vida, unaware that Norris is in the throes of a wild--but unvoiced--passion, must herself decide whether to remain in the small English village where she has lived her entire life, or strike out on her own in search of a grand adventure. Watching these two people surprised by love is Manford, the young disabled man who has been in Vida's charge for the last twenty years.\u00a0\u00a0Possessed of a strange and gentle intelligence, it is through Manford that Norris and Vida finally come to recognize each other and themselves. Heartwarm- ing, madcap, utterly beautiful, LAMB IN LOVE celebrates the strange and mysterious brilliance that is love.\u00a0\u00a0And it confirms Carrie Brown's status as an important and luminous talent. -->",

        "Title": "A Transaction Of Free Men: The Birth And Course Of The Declaration Of Independence (A Da Capo paperback)",
        "Authors": "By Hawke, David Freeman",
        "Description": "The story of the Declaration of Independence--its genesis, drafting, ratification, and influence--is as complex as any great vision and realization. Did it merely sum up the prevailing thought of its day, or was it an advanced expression of uniquely American ideals? Were its signers aware of the Declaration's full revolutionary significance, or did they see it as the rationale for an economic dispute? Such questions face any historian of the period and require an extraordinary control of materials, a sensitive reading of character and text, and a lucid gift for recreating a time more than two centuries ago for scholars and general readers alike.David Hawke possesses all of these qualities in abundance. His portraits of Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration, and John Adams, who led the fight for its adoption, are wonderfully complex and sound. As he says in his new introduction, \"the main thesis [of the book] is that the Declaration could only have been written by Thomas Jefferson, not just because of his talent with words, but also because he, coming from an agrarian South, held ideas about society and government not shared by northerners.\" A double portrait of men who began as allies, became enemies, and at the end of their lives resolved their antagonism into deep respect and friendship, this book provides fascinating reading for anyone interested in the foundations of the American experiment.",

This is the story of a life in law enforcement, and of one man\u2019s determined struggle to strengthen and reform the FBI while ensuring its freedom from political interference.\u00a0Bill Clinton called Freeh a \u201claw enforcement legend\u201d when he nominated him as FBI Director. The good feelings would not last. Going toe-to-toe with his boss during the scandal-plagued \u201890s, Freeh fought hard to defend his agency from political interference and to protect America from the growing threat of international terrorism. When Clinton later called that appointment the worst one he had made as president, Freeh considered it \u201ca badge of honor.\u201d \u00a0This is Freeh\u2019s entire story, from his Catholic upbringing in New Jersey to law school, the FBI training academy, his career as a US District attorney and as a federal judge, and finally his eight years as the nation\u2019s top cop. This is the definitive account of American law enforcement in the run-up to September 11. Freeh is clear-eyed, frank, the ultimate realist, and he offers resolute vision for the struggles ahead.",

As Clive Barnes wrote, \u201cTime catches up with genius \u2026Waiting for Godot is one of the masterpieces of the century.\u201dThe story revolves around two seemingly homeless men waiting for someone\u2014or something\u2014named Godot. Vladimir and Estragon wait near a tree, inhabiting a drama spun of their own consciousness. The result is a comical wordplay of poetry, dreamscapes, and nonsense, which has been interpreted as mankind\u2019s inexhaustible search for meaning. Beckett\u2019s language pioneered an expressionistic minimalism that captured the existential post-World War II Europe. His play remains one of the most magical and beautiful allegories of our time.",
