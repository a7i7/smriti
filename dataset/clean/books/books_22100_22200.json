The struggle draws them both into a terrifying supernatural realm where they find themselves surrounded by memories, by horrors, and by overwhelming truths.

        "Authors": "By Preston, Caroline",
        "Description": "Just as Jay Gatsby was haunted by Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fizgerald was haunted by his own great first love a Chicago socialite named Ginevra. Alluring, capricious, and ultimately unavailable, she would become his first muse, the inspiration for such timeless characters as Gatsby's Daisy and Isabelle Borge in This Side of Paradise.Caroline Preston's astute perceptions of her characters and the cultural landscapes they inhabit have earned her work comparisons to to that of Anne Tyler, Alison Lurie, and Diane Johnson. Now, in this richly imagined and ambitious novel, Preston deftly evokes the entire sweep of Ginevra's life from her first meeting with Scott to the second act of her sometimes charmed, sometimes troubled life.Ginevra was sixteen, a rich man\u2019s daughter who had been told she was pretty far too often for her own good. Scott was nineteen, a poor boy full of ambition. They met at a country club dance in St. Paul, Minnesota, in January 1916. For almost a year they wrote each other letters so long, breathless, and yearning that they often required more than one envelope.But despite their intense epistolary romance, the relationship wouldn\u2019t last. After throwing him over with what he deemed supreme boredom and indifference,\u201d she impulsively married a handsome aviator from the right society background.Ruminating over what might have been had she picked the writer instead of the flier, she furtively reads the now famous Fitzgerald\u2019s work. When she sees herself much to her surprise in his characters, it\u2019s not just as the spoiled debutante he\u2019d known; he\u2019s also uncannily predicted the woman she\u2019s become, cracks and all.An affecting story of two people, one famous, one known only through her portrayals in enduring works of fiction, Gatsby\u2019s Girl is a tremendously entertaining and moving novel about the powerful forces of first love, memory, and art.",

Chronologically arranged to illustrate the development of the story form in Spanish, the stories are presented both in Spanish and English, enabling students to learn a language while simultaneously studying literary classics.\u3000Edited by former Queens College professor Angel Flores, the volume includes brilliant works not available in any other edition published in the U.S. First-rate stories range from the medieval tales of Don Juan Manuel and the classics of Cervantes, Alarcon and Miguel de Unamuno to the highly acclaimed contemporary works of Jorge Luis Borges, Camilo Jose Cela, and Juan Goytisolo. Also included are satirical views of Spanish life by Leopolda Alas (Clarin) and Emilia Pardo Bazan, charming sketches by Ricardo Palma, and the socially and politically inspired writings of Benito Lynch and Horacia Quiroga.\u3000With this book, language students will be able to follow Spanish classics in the original while having immediate access to a complete, faithful English translation on the facing page. The dual format saves hours in word-hunting and note-taking, allowing more time for intensified study of the language, building vocabulary and practicing conversation. The present volume also contains an informative essay on Spanish literature, a biographical-critical introduction to each story, notes on obscure references and idioms and a Spanish-to-English vocabulary.Students of language and comparative literature will find the dual-language format convenient and helpful and the stories deeply satisfying; readers interested in Spanish literature will want to add this important and stimulating collection to their personal libraries.",

        "Description": "The right choices in risky times. Jane Bryant Quinn knows how to find them, as readers of her personal finance columns--in Newsweek, Woman's Day and newspapers nationwide--can confirm. She's smart, doesn't skirt the tough questions, and doesn't bore you to death with complicated theories or formulas. She steers you away from financial schemes that promise you the moon. But she's not timid about investing. She urges you to take intelligent action, to seize opportunities in both good times and bad.In Making the Most of Your Money, Quinn does on paper what good financial planners should do in person. She guides you toward organizing your financial life--without fuss or pain and in a way that is right for you. She shows you how to set sensible goals; critiques the expanding range of financial products (what's good and what's bad in mutual fnnds, stocks, bonds, real estate, fixed-income savings, and Wall Street's dubious exotica); and offers common-sense advice in all areas of personal finance-borrowing, saving, insuring, investing, and much more. Making the Most of Your Money tells you exactly what you need to know to stay on top of a changing economy.Quinn's particular strength is to take you beyond the outworn assumptions of the past 20 years, to lay out the new money strategies that will dominate the 1990s. From this book you learn how to compensate for the downturn in incomes and property values; how to borrow intelligently in an era when loans are harder to get; how to earn more money by making wise investment choices; how to prepare for a future where Social Security won't be worth as much as it is right now. Here, you'll find all of her personal systems for balancing safety with prudent risk, explained in her clear and witty prose.From building financial safety nets to choosing the right mortgage, from finding a better credit card to planning for college and retirement, Quinn shows you what works--and what doesn't. Families, couples, singles--in fact, all Americans who want to handle their money better--will find Making the Most of Your Money the single best financial guide to the decade ahead.",

        "Authors": "By Carpenter, Monte (EDT)",
        "Description": "Rudy Giuliani was named Time magazine's 2001 Person of the Year, and it's no  wonder. He was the courageous and inspirational leader who emerged shaken but  not deterred from the smoldering ruins left behind in the aftermath of the  September 11 terrorist attacks on New York City's World Trade Center. His  hands-on actions and soothing words comforted not only a shocked, grieving  city but a nation as well. Frequently brash and occasionally confrontational,  Giuliani attacked and drastically reduced crime in New York City, among his  numerous accomplishments. This compilation of about 300 quotes by and about  the now-former mayor and rising political star tackles dozens of compelling  topics.",

        "Title": "Loving",
        "Authors": "By Sullivan, Charles (EDT)",
        "Description": "\"Love is a crooked thing,\" W. B. Yeats wrote, \"there is nobody wise enough to find out all that is in it.\" Love includes the romance of a moment and the devotion of a lifetime, both elation and grief, the ecstasy of being together and the pain of being apart. We may (or may not) love ourselves, one another, friends, children, parents, places, things; our feelings may be simple or very complicated. \"How do I love thee?\" asked Elizabeth Barrett Browning. \"Let me count the ways.\"Loving: Poetry and Art embraces the astonishing variety and complexity of love as no other book has done. Among the 100 poems and songs and nearly 90 beautifully reproduced images, we find \"legendary lovers\" from Adam and Eve and Romeo and Juliet to John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The lover's fascination with the beloved's beauty, the compelling thrill of first love, the perils and delights of intimacy, the special bonding that is possible for couples - all are celebrated here. Love between parents and children is reflected in the anonymous \"Lady Bug\" poem as well as in Sylvia Plath's intensely personal lines, while the universality of human feelings is shown in poetry about creation and spiritual love, such as Gerard Manley Hopkins' \"Glory be to God for dappled things.\"To create this unique and deeply moving book, Charles Sullivan has gathered outstanding examples of poetry and art from various cultures and historical periods, and presents them so that words and images go beautifully together. Here we discover or rediscover love poems by Dylan Thomas, Gwendolyn Brooks, Pablo Neruda, Robert Bly, Emily Dickinson, Ted Hughes, William Shakespeare, Erica Jong, Seamus Heaney, W. H. Auden, Takasaki Masakase, Anne Sexton, Nikki Giovanni, John Donne, Walt Whitman, and Edna St. Vincent Millay, among others. Their poetry is accompanied by paintings, sculpture, photographs, and other stirring images by such artists as Chagall, Rodin, Mary Cassatt, David Hockney, Michelangelo, Van Gogh, Georgia O'Keeffe, Whistler, Picasso, Monet, Romare Bearden, Renoir, Matisse, Red Grooms, and Mary Frank.Biographical notes give the reader useful background information about the artists and poets included in the book.Elegant and distinctive in design and content, Loving is a treasure for single persons, couples, and families, for the young and old alike. It will be enjoyed many times, in many moods. And as Yeats wrote about love itself, \"one cannot begin it too soon.\"",

When the National Weather Service predicts a cold front followed by snow, promising to all but extinguish the fire, the camp is demobilized, but a last-minute rescue of a firefighter with a broken leg detains Anna and the San Juan crew. Driven on by the erratic thunderstorm of the front, wind shears in the steep canyon, creating the deadly weather conditions for a firestorm. As the ravine explodes in flames propelled by the racing winds, the crew tries desperately to outrun the blaze, ultimately seeking refuge in their individual silver fire shelters wryly referred to as shake 'n' bakes.When the fire finally passes, Anna emerges from her shelter to check on the fate of her companions. The sound of each exhausted voice, the sight of each bruised and blackened figure, is cause for celebration - until one member of the crew is found inside his shelter with a knife in his back. With darkness comes snow, making immediate rescue impossible, and Anna must tend to the physical and emotional wounds of the crew while seeking the identity of the murderer in their midst.",

And for those who patrol the streets of Philadelphia, that line sometimes seems all too easy to cross. When a street cop is killed in a rundown crack house, his indignant fellow cops predictably start rounding up every young black man in sight. Even after the cop's sergeant, Eddie North, discovers the Mafia may have been behind the murder, tension between the police and the black community continues to escalate.Fueled by the surrounding discord, Eddie becomes obsessed with taking the mob boss down for good. And he's getting help from an unexpected source -- the slain cop's sister. Also a police officer, she is going undercover as the mob boss's lover to get the inside scoop on her brother's murder. But infiltrating the mob is no easy task, and Eddie watches in jealous alarm as she starts slipping precariously into the Mafia life. As the city heads toward a racial conflagration and street cops go to war with the mob, Eddie discovers what can happen when people -- particularly cops -- try to create and inflict their own ideas of justice. With dead-on insight into the private world of the police force -- the unexpected, terrifying danger, as well as the comic moments -- Scott Flander takes the reader right onto the streets and reveals, in an unforgettable cityscape, the powerful forces that can tear apart the urban fabric.",

Nearly everything we did had never been done before. . . . What is now commonplace was in its beginning a grand and glorious adventure for the people of our country and the world, a vicarious balloon ride into the stars. . . .\"Just how a young man growing up in a small southern town with only one one-hundred-watt A.M. radio station and no network affiliation became one of the world's most respected broadcasters in the nation makes for a \"grand and glorious adventure\" in itself. Now, in this fascinating and charmingly candid memoir of a career spanning half a century, David Brinkley recollects from his own unique vantage point the remarkable, shaky beginnings of television news, the ever-changing social and political landscape of our country, and the colorful people who have crossed his path. He includes priceless moments playing poker with Harry Truman, riding the rails with Winston Churchill, being whisked off by helicopter to Camp David by Lyndon Johnson, and receiving the distinguished Medal of Freedom from George Bush. From the New Deal to the Contract with America, David Brinkley has seen it all. . . and he knows how to tell a story--especially his own.\"Reading it is like sitting in your living room, having a conversation with this wonderful man.

Words like \"judgment,\" \"faith,\" \"dogma,\" \"salvation,\" \"sinner\"\u2014even \"Christ\"\u2014formed what she called her \"scary vocabulary,\" words that had become so codified or abstract that their meanings were all but impenetrable.

Blending history, theology, storytelling, etymology, and memoir, Norris uses these words as a starting point for reflection, and offers a moving account of her own gradual conversion. She evokes a rich spirituality rooted firmly in the chaos of everyday life\u2014and offers believers and doubters alike an illuminating perspective on how we can embrace ancient traditions and find faith in the contemporary world.",

Even the smallest hints from author J. K. Rowling about what may happen to Harry and his friends have been major news stories.In The End of Harry Potter?, David Langford\u2014Potter fan and award-winning writer\u2014delves into the many mysteries which remain unsolved.  Is Albus Dumbledore really dead? Whose side is Severus Snape really on? What are the remaining horcruxes, where He Who Shall Not Be Named has stashed his soul? Does Harry bear a part of the Dark Lord's soul in his scar, and is this why he understands Parseltongue?J. K. Rowling is the only person who knows the answers to these questions. But in this highly entertaining book, Langford uses his deep knowledge of the six published Harry Potter novels to explore these and other mysteries, and to present a selection of possible outcomes.Only the publication of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows will lay these questions to rest, but in the meantime, fans of the series will find David Langford's book entertaining and thought-provoking, and a perfect way to refresh their memory of the first six books in readiness for the last.",

While rushing along, though, the days seem to get shorter and shorter. If only time would hold still, just a little bit, to let us savor life's simplest moments. . . .The Art of Doing Nothing will help to ease these beat-the-clock jitters. The stress-reducing techniques described here require no time, no skill, no commitment. A practical guide to rest and relaxation, it ushers us into a world where \"being\" is more compelling than \"doing.\" Beautifully illustrated with Erica Lennard's photographs, The Art of Doing Nothing gives us permission to celebrate idleness in all its mesmerizing forms. V\u00e9ronique Vienne's delightfully informative essays on the art of breathing, meditating, bathing, listening, waiting, and more offer useful tips on such skills as how to whistle, stay in the moment, take a nap, cure a cold, or watch the sun set over the horizon. Without further ado--and without feeling guilty--we learn to unwind, exhale, and, yes, stop and smell the roses.Like Ira Gershwin, you will be delighted to discover that you've got plenty of nothin', and that nothin's plenty for you.",

To them, owning a slice of our history is as important as finding that perfect piece to adorn the living room; adding to a collection; or just to getting a good bargain.   In this increasingly cookie-cutter, IKEA world, flea markets have endured, grown and recently shown an upscale trend. In Flea, Zubrod and Stern help make the flea market experience and process easy and enjoyable. They describe places to go, what to look for, how to tell what&#39;s \"a good thing\" and what&#39;s not and how to incorporate a find into an original home aesthetic. They also introduce readers to more than 50 classics items from the recent past that serve as the backbone of a new trend in art: from club chairs to cocktail shakers, Bauer pottery to Ring-Ding glass, fly-fishing gear to barbed wire. They also list the major flea market meccas in America, the world and on the World Wide Web; offer strategies for hunting; and show how dozens of today&#39;s top designers have woven their flea finds into their lives.",
