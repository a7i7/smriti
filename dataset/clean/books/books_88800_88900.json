Her nineteen-year-old brother, Spencer, is an out of work actor facing a family deadline to get his career in order. Eighteen-year-old Lola has the delicate looks of a model, the practical nature of a nurse, and a wealthy society boyfriend. Eleven-year-old Marlene is the family terror with a tragic past. When the Martins turn fifteen, they are each expected to take over the care of a suite in the once elegant, now shabby Art Deco hotel. For Scarlett\u2019s fifteenth birthday, she gets both a room called the Empire Suite, and a permanent guest named Mrs. Amberson. Scarlett doesn\u2019t quite know what to make of this C-list starlet, world traveler, and aspiring autobiographer who wants to take over her life. And when she meets Eric, an astonishingly gorgeous actor who has just moved to the city, her summer takes a second unexpected turn. With Mrs. Amberson calling the shots, Spencer\u2019s career to save, Lola\u2019s love life to navigate around, and Marlene\u2019s prying eyes everywhere, things won\u2019t be easy.

Wonderful, often underused flavors like curry, lemongrass, fresh ginger, rose water, and balsamic and wine vinegars brighten dishes that are a far cry from the bland, repetitive meals people often associate with the restrictions of fat-free cooking.Schlesinger makes steamed dumplings with wonton wrappers, and blends blueberries and seltzer water to make a frozen fruit ice. Robust vegetable stews are made more interesting with barley, bulgur, and couscous. She moistens and enriches cake batter with prune puree in place of butter or shortening and makes crumb crusts from fat-free cookies. And in her variation on chocolate-covered strawberries, cocoa powder, which has no fat, replaces the melted chocolate.",

So when a drunken brawl at the Icicle Creek Tavern leaves a loner named Alvin De Muth dead, the residents feel as if they\u2019ve gone back to the Bad Old Days.The inquiry into the unfortunate incident should be a no-brainer. There are plenty of witnesses to the fatal fight, but since most of them were half-tanked at the time, Sheriff Milo Dodge is left scratching his head over a fistful of conflicting stories. Luckily for Emma Lord, editor and publisher of The Alpine Advocate, the news breaks just before the paper\u2019s Wednesday deadline, so for once she can give the radio station some real competition. But soon she has an even bigger story to report: a heartbreaking highway accident that leaves two people dead and a likable young local on life support.From Front Street to River Road, from Stella\u2019s Styling Salon to the Burger Barn, rumors are flying. Are the two tragedies linked in some inexplicable way? Was De Muth a mentor or a menace to Alpine\u2019s teenage boys? What compels an ethereal female to visit Emma and insist that De Muth\u2019s self-confessed killer is innocent? And (much to Emma\u2019s chagrin) is it true that the sheriff is about to rewed his ex?Emma senses that there\u2019s a story behind the story and is determined to uncover the truth. Assisted by that human bulldozer Vida Runkel, the Advocate\u2019s House & Home editor, Emma goes for the gold.Welcome to another Daheim masterpiece that will challenge the cleverest reader\u2013and a warmhearted world of small-town life, as richly addictive as it is dangerous.",

        "Authors": "By Herzlinger, Regina E.",
        "Description": "In the battle for U.S. health care, patients and doctors are losing. Who Killed Health Care? shows how to win the war. One of the nation's most respected health care analysts, Regina Herzlinger exposes the motives and methods of those who have crippled America's health care system-figures in the insurance, hospital, employment, governmental, and academic sectors. She proves how our current system, which is organized around payers and providers rather than the needs of its users, is dangerously eroding patient welfare and is pushing costs out of the reach of millions.Who Killed Health Care? then outlines Herzlinger's bold new plan for a consumer-driven system that will deliver affordable, high-quality care to everyone. By putting insurance money in the hands of patients, removing the middleman in the doctor-patient relationship, and giving employers cost relief, consumers and physicians will be empowered to make the system work the way it should. Herzlinger describes in precise detail how her innovative program will provideSmaller, disease-focused medical facilities that provide complete care for patientsA national system of medical records that provides privacy with confidential access by approved practitionersMandatory performance evaluations of all hospitals and all other medical organizationsMandatory health insurance with subsidies for those who cannot afford itWho Killed Health Care? is a call to arms that must be answered; the welfare of every American hangs in the balance.\u201cA brilliant analysis\u2026 A must-read.\u201d \u2013 Bill George, Professor, Harvard Business School and Former CEO of Medtronic\u201cAs it becomes more and more obvious to everyone that our current health care system is unsustainable, this is the book that had to be written.\u201d \u2013 Daniel H. Johnson, Jr. MD, former president of the American Medical Association\u201cRegina Herzlinger\u2019s ideas to tackle the crisis of the U.S. health care system are based on keen knowledge of the system\u2019s existing difficulties along with insights that introduce the reader to new streamlined choices that have the potential of getting both quantity and cost under control.\u201d \u2013 Joseph Kennedy, founder, chairman, and president, Citizens Energy Corporation, CEO, Citizens Health Care, former representative (D-Mass)\u201cRegina Herzlinger\u2026 offers a vision of the way things can be, should be, and will be sooner or later. The only question is: how long do we have to wait?\u201d \u2013 Greg Scandlen, founder, Consumers for Health Choices\u201cRegi Herzlinger has brilliantly articulated a better way \u2013 embracing the principles of competition and innovation that cause every other sector of our economy to thrive. Discharging American health care from the ICU can only happen by putting individual  Americans \u2013 not politicians and bureaucrats \u2013 back in charge of their health care decisioins.\u201d \u2013 U.S. Senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla), M.D. \u201cFollowing on the heels of her landmark Market-Driven Health Care, Herzlinger lays it on the line with her expose of what many who work in the health care industry have felt in their gut. Now it is articulated in an entertaining and must-read portrayal, with you and me as the only way out.\u201d \u2013 Dennis White, executive vice president for strategic development, National Business Coalition on Health\u201cA wonderful Orwellian romp through issues which carry a deadly irony. The killers of health care are, of course, the third parties, each of which has an itchy palm and a commitment to profit or power which exceeds the commitment to service, with each engaging the others within a politically shaped box. Rarely has the case for the public been made with so much force, foresight, and wit, and a better way forward shown so clearly.\u201d \u2013 James F. Fries, MD, Professor of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine \u201cYou can practically hear the war chants as Professor Herzlinger sets out her view of what\u2019s wrong with the health care system and how to fix it. You\u2019d best read it so you can decide which side you will be on when the battle is joined.\u201d \u2013 Paul Levy, CEO, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA \u201cRegina Herzlinger, the nation\u2019s leading expert on consumer-driven health care, has given us a brilliant analysis of the flaws in our health care system and what it will take to get it back on track. Her latest book is a must-read.\u201d \u2013 Bill George, Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business School, Former CEO, Medtronic, and author of Authentic Leadership\u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with her diagnosis and prescription for the U.S. health care system, but you do have to read her book. Once again, Professor Herzlinger has put together a well researched, well written, and very provocative blueprint for the future of health care.\u201d Peter L.

Murray instructs readers from Scripture and the life of Jesus that prayer is the root and strength of all work for God, that God intends to answer every prayer, and that prayer is meant to be a way of life.  These thirty-one classic meditations, written in 1885, have been edited and clarified for new readers.",

        "Description": "Like the first-century Pharisees, we've reduced Christianity to a set of propositional beliefs. Truth is, we've gotten away from what it really means to be a Christian. In The Jesus of Suburbia, Mike Erre reveals that we've created a Jesus in our own image. In a fresh, startling manner, Erre helps us understand that the real Jesus is calling us to live, act, and think in ways that overturn the status quo.\"Expect no sugar-coated sweetness about 'felt needs' and in-church coffee bars from Erre, pastor of teaching at Rock Harbor Church in Costa Mesa, Calif. Expect instead compelling discussion of how the Christian church has lost sight of the revolutionary teaching and love of Jesus. 'Much of the message of American Christianity presents Jesus as the purveyor of the American Dream,' he says. American Christians, he claims, have reduced Jesus to a study of risk management; we want him to be 'predictable and safe.' Erre also uses the adjectives 'insecure, threatened, naive, simplistic, mean and shortsighted' to describe many of today's churches. He lambastes our love of theology instead of Jesus, our contentment with 'simply knowing about him instead of knowing him.' While this protest continues in the vein of other recent books that take a hard look at Jesus and the church (Jesus Mean and Wild; Out of Your Comfort Zone), it offers a fresh look at how the American church must begin 'demonstrating the message of Christ,' not merely explaining it. After all, says Erre, 'if you follow Jesus, you follow the most radical man who ever existed.'\"--Publishers Weekly",

        "Title": "Paragons: Twelve Master Science Fiction Writers Ply Their Craft",
        "Authors": "By Wilson, Robin Scott (EDT)",
        "Description": "Show, don't tell is the first thing a fiction writer learns. The dozen masters assembled here each take one of their own stories and show exactly how they crafted a particular aspect of it - the style, the theme, the characters, the plot, the setting, or the point of view.Included in this volume are a dozen award-winning masters of the short story: Greg Bear, Pat Cadigan, Karen Joy Fowler, Joe Haldeman, James Patrick Kelly, John Kessel, Nancy Kress, Pat Murphy, Kim Stanley Robinson, Lucius Shepard, Bruce Sterling, and Howard Waldrop. Each brings great insight into the art of writing fiction. Greg Bear asserts that characters shouldn't just be individuals - they should address larger questions of characterizing nations, species, or entire worlds - while Pat Murphy treats characters as imaginary friends who evolve during the writing process. Lucius Shepard discusses the ways in which tiny details evoke a setting and Howard Waldrop assesses the ways in which a literary chameleon can adapt his or her writing style from story to story.Rounding out the book is Bruce Sterling's wonderful \"Workshop Lexicon,\" in which he sums up the most common flows in beginner's fiction. For example: \"Signal from Fred,\" in which the author's subconscious, alarmed by the poor quality of the work, makes unwitting critical comments like \"This sounds like a bad movie.\"",

        "Title": "Managers As Facilitators: A Practical Guide to Getting Work Done in a Changing Workplace",
        "Authors": "By Weaver, Richard G. and Farrell, John D.",
        "Description": "Offers a practical, effective program to help transform leaders and managers in all types of organizations into skilled facilitators Teaches managers the facilitation skills they need to help their organizations improve productivity Includes real-life examples from manufacturing, telecommunications, health care, education, retail and other service businesses, and government and other non-profit organizations Today&apos;s managers are confronted with increasing pressure to produce more with fewer resources. In this pressure-packed environment, managers are finding that the old \"direct-and-control\" model simply does not work. People need more freedom to make decisions, respond quickly to their customers, and work together more effectively. Successful managers have learned how to use the role of facilitator to help people exercise this freedom to produce the results needed by their organizations. Managers As Facilitators presents a new, easy-to-understand model of facilitation that focuses on getting work done. It provides practical guidance for managers and leaders who need to be successful in this new role. Weaver and Farrell show managers how to use themselves in new ways, capitalize on group dynamics, and build effective work processes. They explain that to become a successful facilitator, one must recognize and use the four key elements of the facilitation model: 1. Task: Facilitators are clear about the work that groups must complete; task drives the actions of effective facilitators. 2. Self: Facilitators learn how to use themselves to help groups complete their tasks; facilitators do this by both using their own personal thoughts and feelings as a \"barometer\" for groups and modeling the types of behavior expected from others. 3. Group: Facilitators help groups understand the difference between normal interactions and those that are a problem; facilitators also help groups capitalize on conflict, rather than be disabled by it. 4. Process: Facilitators use three fundamental processes to help groups: planning, solving problems, and completing work; facilitators are skilled with a number of facilitation tools, using them to help groups run effective meetings, finish projects, etc. Managers As Facilitators offers readers practical ways to manage change and organizational boundaries to achieve the results they want. The authors explain how individuals, groups, and organizations experience change and work with boundaries-and what facilitators do to help. The book&apos;s final chapter synthesizes all the material by presenting \"Quick Fixes\" to common problems.",
