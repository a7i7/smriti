But the affair with Bryan was only just beginning.Bryan, a modestly well-off American who convinced people, Fergie among them, that he was vastly wealthy, and the Duchess, who wanted to shrug off the responsibilities of royalty but hoped to take the prestige and bankability of the Windsors with her, embarked upon a roller coaster ride of fast living which left Bryan bankrupt and Fergie with a world-famous overdraft.As Bryan's friend and business partner, Allan Starkie, was drawn into this relationship, first as a stand-in for Bryan who, for most of the four-year relationship, could not he seen publicly with the Duchess, then as her unpaid business manager and, eventually, to use her own words, as her 'dearest friend and brother'.As such he travelled the world with Fergie, becoming as much her friend as Bryan's. It is from this unique perspective that Starkie is able to give his account of one of the most destructive love affairs of the century. He came to realize that both Bryan and Fergie wanted the same things: fame, wealth and love, and each thought the other could open doors to these treasures.",

        "Description": "Colin Powell is the first in-depth probing into the rise of a man who is arguably, says the author, the first African-American in a position of major national prominence that the general public - black, white, and Hispanic - is ready to judge on merit alone. Long a key figure in the upper echelons of government, Operation Desert Shield, and later Desert Storm, made General Powell a political and military luminary of the highest order, after which both national parties commenced courting him for future elections.Based on more than 120 interviews - including ones with General and Mrs. Powell, family members and colleagues from all stages of his career - General Powell emerges as the embodiment of the American Dream: the son of Jamaican immigrants, he rose from the hard life of the South Bronx to become the most talked about military leader since World War II, a man intimately involved with many of the nation's most dramatic events of the last thirty years.After serving two tours of duty in Vietnam, during which he earned a Soldier's Medal, a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, General Powell was able to survive in the internecine warfare of official Washington. As National Security Adviser and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he has been a central figure in recent foreign affairs from the Reagan-Gorbachev summits to the Gulf War. Through it all, General Powell's popularity has crossed racial lines. \"He would have made it if his color was purple,\" says one who served with then Colonel Powell in Korea in the mid-Seventies.Colin Powell is a story of grit, drive, determination and talent. It is a classic account of an immigrant boy who succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of his parents. It is, uniquely and quintessentially, an American story.",

        "Description": "Your life has a root core that, once understood, unlocks a powerful force to create your life the way it was meant to be, the way you want and need it to be. Key questions and an amazingly clear \"map\" are now at your fingertips to begin your journey to \"Live by Design.\" These are questions that, with the help of this book, you can answer and bring into action-oriented focus:What are the ten most defining moments of your life?What are the seven most critical choices you have made to put you on your current path? Who are the five most pivotal people in your world and how have they shaped you?Identifying and working with these key elements are at the heart of Dr. Phillip C. McGraw's latest work, Self Matters, and soon they will be at the heart of your own new work: you.  Through his books, McGraw has changed the lives of millions. In introducing the world to his matter-of-fact, tell-it-like-it-is philosophy of life, Dr. Phil, as he is known to his legions of fans, has put an end to the \"everyone's a victim\" attitude that had taken hold of our culture. Published in over twenty-five countries, and with millions of books sold, his two number one bestsellers, Life Strategies and Relationship Rescue, forced readers to take a serious look at the excuses they had so long been clinging to as to why they were not happy, not successful, and not enjoying their one chance at living. Now, Dr. Phil takes those lessons a great leap further and explores one of the most challenging questions facing us all: When you look in the mirror, who is truly hiding beneath that face? Instead of taking a surface look at the way we live our lives, Dr. Phil demystifies how your self-concept came to be and gives a nuts-and-bolts approach to creating a new plan for living and, in turn, for discovering the real you.In this groundbreaking work, Dr. Phil challenges you to find your \"authentic self\" -- that person you once were before life took its toll. It is you at your greatest, most fulfilled, most real moment. It is the person you have always wanted to be, but were too distracted, busy, or scared to become. Instead, you have created a \"fictional self\" -- taking on the identity of who you believe you are supposed be, the person people tell you you are. The incongruence between these two selves is what leads you to feel that your life is incomplete, unbalanced, and altogether more difficult than it really should be.The good news is it no longer needs to be that way. By using the plan set forth in Self Matters, Dr. Phil helps you to demystify your self-concept and learn how to reclaim your authentic self. In evaluating your life by only the facts, you can learn to think beyond the excuses and fears that have masked the person you have always wanted to be.Self Matters is one of the most forward-thinking works on self-concept and self-esteem ever published. For the first time, an author tells it how it is and, in the process, teaches us all how to live the lives we have always wanted but prevented ourselves from living. We get only one chance in this world, and now, Dr. Phil shows all how to make the most of it.",

One needs to go beyond the surface, beyond the setting, to a place of trust - achieving a level of intimacy, a kind of nonverbal communication that allows the magic to happen and to be captured by the camera. This, I've discovered - as I've traveled and talked to so many writers of fantasy - is the similarity between our two fields. We're all trying to capture magic.\"",

Greenlaw decided to move back home, to a tiny island seven miles off the Maine coast. There, she would pursue a simpler life as a lobsterman, find a husband, and settle down. But all doesn't go as planned. The lobsters refuse to crawl out from under their rocks and into the traps she and her father have painstakingly set. Fellow islanders draw her into bizarre intrigues, and the eligible bachelors prove even more elusive than the lobsters. But just when she thinks things can't get worse, something happens that forces her to reevaluate everything she thought she knew about life, luck, and lobsters. Filled with nautical detail and the dramas of small-town life, The Lobster Chronicles is a celebration of family and community. Greenlaw proves once again that fishermen are the best storytellers around.",

Here are their stories: wilderness mothers, schoolmarms, Indian squaws, immigrants, homesteaders, and circuit riders. Their personal recollections of prairie fires, locust plagues, cowboy shootouts, Indian raids, and blizzards on the plains vividly reveal the drama, danger and excitement of the pioneer experience.These were women of relentless determination, whose tenacity helped them to conquer loneliness and privation. Their work was the work of survival, it demanded as much from them as from their men\u2014and at last that partnership has been recognized. \u201cThese voices are haunting\u201d (The New York Times Book Review), and they reveal the special heroism and industriousness of pioneer women as never before.",

In this singular survey of this mysterious but all too often palpable force, veteran Time magazine writer Lance Morrow examines the unmistakable ways evil influences our global culture-and how that global culture in turn has magnified evil's menace. Its dramatic reemergence in the national consciousness-against a backdrop of high-tech, sensationalized violence-makes his updated understanding both timely and absolutely necessary.Drawing on examples both obscure and splashed across the headlines, Morrow seeks to understand how evil works, and what purpose, if any, it serves. From the heartrending to the harrowing, from quiet lies to catastrophic acts, his stories are drawn from over thirty years of experience as a revered journalist and essayist. The result is a brilliant synthesis of a lifetime of observation that elegantly illuminates a chronically elusive but fascinating subject.",

These ordinary but remarkable people are among the thousands whose courage and convictions sparked a moral, spiritual, and political revolution in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, leading to the recent collapse of Communism - one of the most momentous events in modern history.When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Barbara von der Heydt launched a private initiative in West Germany to assist refugees from Eastern Europe. As she helped meet their needs, they gave her a glimpse into the lives they had led behind the Iron Curtain, hidden from the eyes of the world. Retracing their steps to Berlin, Leipzig, Warsaw, Budapest, and Moscow, von der Heydt discovered the spiritual roots of the peaceful revolution that shattered Communism.Based on more than one hundred personal interviews with people who actively resisted Communism, Candles behind the Wall vividly depicts the unexpected end of an era. In the dust of the fallen Communist empire, unsung heroes of integrity now tell what really happened.",

A rural Southerner, he had never heard the word meshugge until Avrum Feldman -- a retired New York City furrier -- became his unlikely friend. For Bobo, nothing about that special time and place ever lost its glow: Avrum's obsession with the haunting voice of a famous opera diva, music that no one else could hear; the exotic mingling of Yiddish and German in the dining room; and the girl he met and loved.  In everyone's life, Avrum claimed, there is one grand, undeniable moment that never stops mattering. For Bobo, it was his first glimpse of beautiful Amy Lourie. But, for a wealthy Jewish girl and a Georgia farm boy, the summer had to end, leaving Bobo with the pain of lost love. Nearly forty years later, his children grown and marriage comfortably routine, Bobo comes north once more; there, amidst the haunting hints of Amy's presence, she unexpectedly appears. Nothing has dimmed the passion of their youth, yet two lifetimes and a thousand Catskills sunsets stand between who they were and who they have become. The barriers between them are different now. But mysteriously, miraculously, Bobo reawakens the dream of a love larger than himself....",

New poems like \"Avenue\" and \"The City Elegies\" envision the urban landscape's mysterious epitome of human pain and imagination, forces that recur in \"Ginza Samba,\" an astonishing history of the saxophone, and \"Impossible to Tell,\" a jazz-like work that intertwines elegy with both the Japanese custom of linking-poems and the American tradition of ethnic jokes. A final section of translations includes Pinsky's renderings of poems by Czeslaw Milosz, Paul Celan, and others, as well as the last canto of his award-winning version of the Inferno.",

        "Title": "A Noise of War: Caesar, Pompey, Octavian and the Struggle for Rome",
        "Authors": "By Langguth, A. J.",
        "Description": "Through civil wars and world conflicts, the Roman Republic had survived 400 years, its empire stretching from Spain to Syria and beyond. But at the millennium, it seemed about to buckle.An entrenched Senate would not and could not respond to the nation's precipitous decline; its leaders, locked in the status quo and fighting for privilege, were talking reform to death. As the Republic careened to the brink of ruin, the battle lines were drawn by three figures, all larger than life.Caesar, the bold, rash general; Cicero, the greatest orator of his time; and Pompey, a brilliant and successful campaigner, were locked in a fierce struggle for Rome's future. The contest began with debate in the Forum but led soon to violent riots, then armed revolt on the battlefield and bloodshed on the Senate steps. In the end, it was Octavian, Caesar's clever nephew and unmerciful political heir, who would claim victory. Rome was poised at the dawn of the great Augustan Age.In a rich, scrupulously researched narrative history, A. J. Langguth captures this resounding, epic drama and brings to life the towering figures of the time. Capitalizing on a wealth of primary materials - from Caesar's war stories to Cicero's most intimate letters - Langguth has gone to the heart of the political intrigues, calculated alliances, and mortal rivalries that now, perhaps more than ever, seem especially vibrant and contemporary.We see Caesar, the aristocrat who championed the people's causes but was accused of wanting to be king, as he contends with Cicero, a newcomer to Rome with a sharp tongue and a lightning wit but also a fatal eagerness to please the patricians. Drawn into their struggle were Brutus, Pompey, Cassius, Mark Antony, and the eventual victor, Octavian - lobbying causes, brokering deals, leading armies, and grabbing at power.A Noise of War takes us from Caesar's battlefields in Britannia to Cleopatra's bedroom in Alexandria, from Spartacus' violent slave revolt outside Rome's walls to Brutus' conspiracy within Rome's grandest houses. But above all, this is a compelling account of great men and their admirable women, of great minds, incredible triumphs, and crushing defeats in one of history's most seductive dramas.",

But the minorly aristocratic Haig-Ereildouns\u2019 household falls far short of Melissa\u2019s imaginings. Mrs. Haig-Ereildoun refers to Melissa as \"her American girl\" with a mixture of pride and contempt, expects her to share the children\u2019s bathwater and, most importantly, entreats Melissa to \" try to speak as we do.\" Heaven forbid the children pick up an American accent!But then there is Nanny, the gloriously eccentric octogenarian who raised Mrs. H-E, who offers comfort, and much comic relief; nine-year-old Trevor, Melissa\u2019s charge, whose wisdom and companionship redeem many a lonely day; and her budding friendship with a mysterious Englishman who is miles from her fianc\u00e9 in every way. Melissa converses with Scotish fishermen, breakfasts with a French Minister of Culture, frequents island castles and sixteenth century manor houses, all the while straddling her ill-defined role (somewhere between houseguest and servant) with humor and grace. Melissa\u2019s immersion in this unforgettable world teaches her more than she could possibly have imagined not only about the culture she has come to inhabit but, most importantly, about herself.",

        "Description": "Harvey Penick's life in golf began when he started caddying at the Austin, (Texas), Country Club at age eight. Eighty-one years later he is still there, still dispensing wisdom to pros and beginners alike. His stature in the golf world is reflected in the remarkable array of champions he's worked with, both men and women, including U.S. Open champion and golf's leading money winner Tom Kite, Masters champion Ben Crenshaw, and LPGA Hall of Famers Mickey Wright, Betsy Rawls, and Kathy Whitworth. It is not for nothing that the Teacher of the Year Award given by the Golf Teachers Association is called the Harvey Penick Award.  Now, after sixty years of keeping notes on the things he's seen and learned and on the golfing greats he's taught, Penick is finally letting his Little Red Book (named for the red notebook he's always kept) be seen by the golf world. His simple, direct, practical wisdom pares away all the hypertechnical jargon that's grown up around the golf swing, and lets all golfers, whatever their level, play their best. He avoids negative words; when Tom Kite asked him if he should \"choke down\" on the club for a particular shot, Harvey told him to \"grip down\" instead, to keep the word \"choke\" from entering his mind. He advises golfers to have dinner with people who are good putters; their confidence may rub off, and it's certainly better than listening to bad putters complain. And he shows why, if you've got a bad grip, the last thing you want is a good swing.  Throughout, Penick's love of golf and, more importantly, his love of teaching shine through. He gets as much pleasure from watching a beginner get the ball in the air for the first time as he does when one of his students wins the U.S. Open.  Harvey Penick's Little Red Book is an instant classic, a book to rank with Ben Hogan's Modern Fundamentals of Golf and Tommy Armour's How to Play Your Best Golf All the Time.",

        "Authors": "By Morris, Charles R.",
        "Description": "This is the story of how America's most powerful lobby overcame its shady origins to become an exemplary player in the great debate over the future of Social Security and Medicare.The single, bone-crushing problem in American politics - now and for the next thirty years - is how big a share of the nation's economic pie should go to older people for income support and health care. The American Association of Retired Persons is the eight-hundred-pound gorilla of American politics, an organization made up of 32 million members, the most influential, single-minded voting bloc in the United States. But few people know that the AARP was the brainchild of a budding insurance mogul, Leonard Davis, who made an estimated $200 million flogging high-priced health insurance to the elderly. This book chronicles the rise of the AARP and its fight to shed the vestiges of its unsavory beginnings to become a responsible player at the political table. It is also the first book to set out in clear and readable detail which AARP products are good buys and which ones consumers should avoid.This book takes a close look at the AARP, its financial and business activities, its service network, and its lobbying organization. It explores the structure and financing of senior entitlement programs, and pinpoints the winners and losers in the current system. And, most important, this book analyzes the possibilities of reform and concludes that the continued growth of the health care sector ought not to be cause for undue alarm; in all probability, it will confer important benefits upon the rest of the economy. Indeed, the author proposes practical steps that will likely make the coming transition much easier than it otherwise might be.",

Her son, Thomas, convinces the police that his father's beautiful personal assistant sent the killers, but Thomas is known for his overactive imagination, and he has reasons to lie.Thomas's father, Sir Peter Robinson, the British minister of defense, refuses to believe his son. Instead, he marries his assistant, Greta Grahame, and will be giving evidence for the defense at her trial. He will be the final witness.Author Simon Tolkien successfully combines legal suspense and psychological tension in this sharply etched portrait of four people whose lives are changed by a murder. Alternating between the trial in London's Central Criminal Court and private moments among the characters, Tolkien expertly describes the art of the trial, the clash between Britain's social classes, and, most notably, the complexity of family relations.Who is telling the truth - the new wife or the bereaved son? What will Sir Peter tell the court? With tantalizing ambiguity, Tolkien keeps readers guessing about the true motivations of these characters until the final witness.",

        "Description": "In this new edition of his national bestseller, E. J. Dionne brings up to date his influential proposals for a politics that can and must find a balance between rights and obligations, between responsibility and compassion.From the New, Updated Introduction:\"At the heart of Why Americans Hate Politics is the view that ideas shape politics far more than most accounts of public life usually allow. I believe ideas matter not only to elites and intellectuals, but also to rank and file voters. Indeed, I often think that the rank and file see the importance of ideas more clearly than the elites, who often find themselves surprised by the rise of the movements that arise from the bottom up and shape our politics.\"",

        "Title": "The Kennedy Men: 1901-1963",
        "Authors": "By Leamer, Laurence",
        "Description": "In this triumphant new work already hailed as a powerful American epic, Laurence Leamer chronicles the Kennedy men and their struggle to create the most powerful family in the United States. The Kennedy Men is the first volume in a multi-generational history that will forever change the way America views its most famous family. Beginning in 1901 with twelve-year-old Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. delivering hats to Boston's social elite and ending in 1963 with the assassination of his son, President John F. Kennedy, Leamer seamlessly unites the complex strands of their economic, political, and social rise.This magnificent new volume is based on four years of interviews with Kennedy insiders and experts, as well as in-depth research including unprecedented new sources and materials: the private archives of JFK's longtime secretary Evelyn Lincoln, secret tapes JFK recorded in the Oval Office, revealing letters from the president's doctors, Rose Kennedy's never-before-heard interview tapes, and interviews with CIA operatives and Kennedy family members.Throughout, The Kennedy Men brings to life five bold, ambitious men. The Kennedy patriarch, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., was one of the richest, strongest men in America's history. His firstborn son, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., was the heir apparent, a handsome, gregarious youth who died a hero's death. John F. Kennedy picked up his brother's fallen mantle and carried it all the way to the White House. Leamer details the heartbreaking story of President Kennedy's health and how it affected not only him, but also America and the world. Robert F. Kennedy, his brother's liege, was an attorney general of unprecedented power, fighting both organized crime and a secret war against Castro. Edward M. Kennedy, the youngest of that generation of Kennedy men, was a fun-loving athlete who reluctantly headed up the hard road to power.Combining powerful dramatic narrative with impeccably researched detail, Leamer illuminates the Kennedys' aspirations and love of family, their accomplishments and failures, their heroism and frailty, their loves and passions, and their patriotism and selfishness. Filled with startling revelations from headline-making stories of great events within the Oval Office such as the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis to the secret untold tales of their wives and lovers-the story of the Kennedy men is here in all its triumph and tragedy. It is a spellbinding personal history of individuals and a journey of character through time told by a brilliant, masterful writer.",

        "Title": "SHOWDOWN: The Struggle Between the Gingrich Congress and the Clinton White House",
        "Authors": "By Drew, Elizabeth",
        "Description": "Showdown is the story of the most dramatic political rivalry in decades. The Democratic President, brilliant but seen as indecisive and vulnerable, is directly challenged by the equally brilliant new Republican Speaker of the House, who seeks to complete the Reagan Revolution by repealing the Great Society and the New Deal.Drew writes with proven authority and intimate detail of the titanic battle that ensued between the Clinton administration and the Republican Congress - especially between the wavering President and the determined Speaker. Drew's masterly reporting exposes the range of Gingrich's ambition and the way he sought to control the House. She describes Gingrich's complex relationship with Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who, no enthusiast, struggled to keep up with Gingrich's revolution, and shows the impact the race for the Republican presidential nomination - in particular, between Dole and Senator Phil Gramm - had on national policy.Through amazingly candid interviews with key congressional figures, Drew elicits exactly how the GOP leadership formed a strategy to roll back the welfare state and destroy the power of the Democratic base. She again takes us behind the scenes to show us what the key players - on both sides - were doing and saying privately as they waged their all-out war. She tells us what the outwardly confident Gingrich worried about. She shows President Clinton trying to regain his footing following the devastating election (a humiliation that he and his wife took much harder than was publicly understood) and turning to a new key adviser, Dick Morris. Drew describes what effect Morris, a former Republican adviser, had on Clinton and the new strains within the White House his arrival caused. She presents a White House more riven than any in memory.Showdown makes clear the enormous stakes of this political struggle - no less than the future direction of the federal government and the fate of programs that affect everyone's life.",
