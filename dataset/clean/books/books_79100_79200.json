Buchanan shows how the majority of Christians begin their spiritual journey with excitement and enthusiasm -- only to get bogged down in a \"borderland\" -- an in-between space beyond the \"old life\" but short of the abundant, adventurous existence promised by Jesus. Citing Jonah, he examines the problem of \"borderland living\" -- where doubt, disappointment, guilt, and wonderlessness keep people in a quagmire of mediocrity -- then offers solutions ... effective ways to get unstuck and move into a bold, unpredictable, exhilarating walk with Christ.

Tantalizing recipes for potato masala, dosa, and coconut chutney, among others, emerge from Narayan\u2019s absorbing tales about food and the solemn and quirky customs that surround it.",

In a community where poverty is kept close and passed from one generation to the next, two teenage boys, best friends, stand on top of twin tower blocks. Facing each other across the abyss of London's urban sprawl, they say their good-byes and jump. One dies. The other, alternating with the sister of the deceased, narrates this novel.   James gives us a window into the inner city -- his mom is a crack addict, his gang \"brothers\" force him to kill another black boy. Meina describes with feeling her family history in Somalia: after her parents are killed before her eyes, her village aunt sells her to six husbands -- before she is even a teenager. Desperate to rebuild their lives, James and Meina set out to find the place for which every child longs -- home.   Brutal and shockingly violent in places, rambunctious and lively in others and slyly, dryly witty in yet others, Meina and James's journey toward life through their past is ultimately a powerful story of redemptive love and the debut of an extraordinary literary talent.",

Author Craig C. Hill encourages Christians both to take seriously and to think sensibly about the hope of God's ultimate victory. His new book includes chapters on the nature of the Bible, the history of prophecy, the meaning of apocalyptic writings, the interpretation of Daniel and Revelation, the expectations of Jesus, and the hopes of the early Christians. It also includes an appendix (\"Not Left Behind\") on the subject of the rapture.Endorsed by a wide array of top scholars and church leaders, In God's Time is a reliable guide to this often bewildering but always fascinating subject.",

Bruce Weber, a New York Times reporter, not only interviewed dozens of professional umpires but entered their world, trained to become an umpire, then spent a season working games from Little League to big league spring training. As They See \u2019Em is Weber\u2019s entertaining account of this experience as well as a lively exploration of what amounts to an eccentric secret society, with its own customs, its own rituals, its own colorful vocabulary. Writing with deep knowledge of and affection for baseball, he delves into such questions as: Why isn\u2019t every strike created equal? Is the ump part of the game or outside of it? Why doesn\u2019t a tie go to the runner? And what do umps and managers say to each other during an argument, really? Packed with fascinating reportage that reveals the game as never before and answers the kinds of questions that fans, exasperated by the clich\u00e9s of conventional sports commentary, pose to themselves around the television set, Bruce Weber\u2019s As They See \u2019Em is a towering grand slam.",

The writing is elegant, spare, and wry; the narrative is exquisitely paced. The book\u2019s ending is emotionally shattering\u2014empathetic, redemptive, and shocking. \u2022 Startlingly revisionist portrait of JFK: We see Kennedy at his best, as a visionary statesman, a former soldier turned moral pacifist, a loving parent and devoted husband. And we see him at his worst, as a compulsive philanderer whose countless conquests\u2014of movie stars, socialites, secretaries, and interns\u2014ruined hundreds of lives.  \u2022 Amazing cast of characters: They are all here: Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford, Angie Dickinson, Judith Campbell, LBJ, Fiddle and Faddle, Eisenhower, and perhaps most memorably, Jacqueline Kennedy.",

        "Authors": "By Frank, Robert H. and Cook, Philip J.",
        "Description": "Disney chairman Michael Eisner topped the 1993 Business Week chart of America's highest-paid executives, his $203 million in earnings roughly 10,000 times that of the lowest paid Disney employee.During the last two decades, the top one percent of U.S. earners captured more than 40 percent of the country's total earnings growth, one of the largest shifts any society has endured without a revolution or military defeat.  Robert H. Frank and Philip J. Cook argue that behind this shift lies the spread of \"winner-take-all markets\"&#151;markets in which small differences in performance give rise to enormous differences in reward.  Long familiar in sports and entertainment, this payoff pattern has increasingly permeated law, finance, fashion, publishing, and other fields.  The result: in addition to the growing gap between rich and poor, we see important professions like teaching and engineering in aching need of more talent.  This relentless emphasis on coming out on top&#151;the best-selling book, the blockbuster film, the Super Bowl winner&#151;has molded our discourse in ways that many find deeply troubling.",

He was airlifted to a shock-trauma hospital. He had lost sixty percent of his blood, his heart had moved across his chest, and his organs and pelvis were pulverized. He was placed in a medically-induced coma. When Brian finally emerged from the coma two months later, he had no memory of the accident. He could see and hear, but not move or talk. Unable to communicate to his doctors, nurses, or frantic parents, he heard words like ?vegetable\u201d and ?nursing home.\u201d If he lived, doctors predicted he might not be able to walk again, and certainly not swim. Then, miraculously, Brian clawed his way back to the living. First blinking his eyelids, then squeezing a hand, then smiling, he gradually emerged from his locked-in state. The former swimmer and bodybuilder had lost one hundred pounds. Iron Heart is the first-person account of his ordeal and his miraculous comeback. With enormous fortitude he learned to walk, then run, and eventually, to swim. With his dream of competing in the Ironman Triathlon spurring him on, Brian defied all odds, and three-and-a-half years after his accident, crossed the finish line in Kona, Hawaii. Brian\u2019s inspiring journey from coma to Kona is brought to life in this memoir.",

Now families have other alternatives.  Fathers can stay home, work flexibly, go part-time, or help out so stay-at-home-mothers enjoy personal fulfillment too.  Prepared women can choose the lives they want by following the common sense prescriptions in \"How to Avoid the Mommy Trap.\"  Julie Shields interviewed marital counselors, childcare workers, negotiation experts, employers, child development experts, and parents to find out how to create a family balance.  How to Avoid the Mommy Trap emphasizes real-life solutions and strategies, and highlights common missteps.  Weaving research and anecdote together, Julie Shields demonstrates the value and efficacy of a new parenting paradigm - sharing.  This sensible primer is for every parent thinking about having children but wondering if and how to balance work, parenthood, and life.

For while Josey has settled into an uneventful life in her mother\u2019s house, her one consolation is the stockpile of sugary treats and paperback romances she escapes to each night\u2026.

In this book, the former Minister of Defense and Finance draws on his unique personal experience, extensive relationships with members of the main political groups and parties in Iraq, and deep understanding of the history and society of his country to answer the baffling questions that persist about its current crises. What really led the United States to invade Iraq, and why have events failed to unfold as planned?The Occupation of Iraq examines what the United States did and didn\u2019t know at the time of the invasion, the reasons for the confused and contradictory policies that were enacted, and the emergence of the Iraqi political class during the difficult transition process. The book tracks the growth of the insurgency and illuminates the complex relationships among Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds. Bringing the discussion forward to the reconfiguration of political forces in 2006, Allawi provides in these pages the clearest view to date of the modern history of Iraq and the invasion that changed its course in unpredicted ways.",

        "Description": "The Lincolns spent the summer of 1862 north of the White House at the Soldiers\u2019 Home. The lush, cool hill overlooking the squalid capital promised the Lincolns an escape from the \"\"city of stink.\"\" Despite fears about Lincoln\u2019s vulnerability in the secluded place, Lincoln spent a quarter of his presidency at the Soldiers\u2019 Home. But until the National Trust for Historic Preservation began restoring the cottage, little had been done to explore this missing link in Lincoln\u2019s life. Elizabeth Smith Brownstein fills in a critical gap. Using diaries, letters, and eyewitness accounts, she provides unusual perspectives on Lincoln\u2019s relationships, traces the evolution of Lincoln\u2019s image, examines the Lincoln marriage, and more. Lincoln\u2019s Other White House is a vivid evocation of a turbulent era, and an intimate portrait of the still elusive president.",

        "Description": "\"Doing Both shows how Cisco turns business questions into market answers, offering real-life examples that will benefit forward-looking leaders.\" \u2014Jeff Immelt, Chairman and CEO, GE\"The best business books build around a single idea, often contrarian and counterintuitive. Everyone knows you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it, too. One of the first things you learn at business school is that management is about making difficult choices. Well, not always. This book persuades the reader that in decision making \u2018and\u2019 is often better than \u2018or.\u2019 Well worth the read.\" \u2014Sir Terry Leahy, CEO, Tesco\"Companies are often confronted with false choices, such as disruptive or sustaining innovation and optimization or reinvention. This book draws on Cisco\u2019s impressive track record over the last decade to illustrate that the correct strategy is always to do both.\" \u2014Ratan Tata, Chairman, Tata Group\"I have a very short personal list of \u2018most-admired companies,\u2019 and Cisco is one of them. Its management team has figured out how to break many \u2018either-or\u2019 tradeoffs that limit most companies\u2019 abilities to innovate and grow. This book is a lucid, cogent chronicle of how they do this. Your entire management team should read it.\" \u2014Clayton Christensen, Robert & Jane Cizik Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School, and author of The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\"Insightful recommendations from a key executive within Cisco, the game-changing leader in networking for the Internet.\" \u2014Garth Saloner, Philip H. Knight Professor, and Dean, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University\"Doing Both brings together many powerful lessons behind the story of Cisco, a company with a long record of delivering consistent innovation and strong business results. I encourage senior executives to embrace the challenges presented in this thoughtful book.\" \u2014Dominic Barton, Global Managing Director, McKinsey & CompanyOver the past seven years, in a highly unstable global economy, Cisco doubled revenue, tripled profits, and quadrupled earnings per share. How? By Doing Both. When companies face key strategic decisions, they often take one path and abandon the other. They focus on innovation and new business at the expense of core businesses or vice versa. They stress discipline and sacrifice flexibility. They focus on customers and ignore partners. And they struggle. Cisco believes there is a better way: Doing Both. Doing Both means approaching every decision as an opportunity to seize, not a sacrifice to endure. It means avoiding false choices, reduced expectations, and weak compromises. It means finding ways to make each option benefit and mutually reinforce the other. In this book, Cisco Senior Vice President Inder Sidhu explains why \u201cdoing both\u201d is today\u2019s best strategy. Then, drawing on Cisco\u2019s hardwon insights and the experiences of companies like Procter & Gamble, Whirlpool, and Harley-Davidson, Inder presents a complete blueprint for \"doing both\" in your organization, too.Win by Doing Both!\u2022 Sustaining and Disruptive Innovation\u2022 Existing and New Business Models\u2022 Optimization and Reinvention\u2022 Satisfied Customers and Gratified Partners\u2022 Established and Emerging Countries\u2022 Doing Things Right and Doing What Matters\u2022 Superstar Performers and Winning Teams\u2022 Authoritative Leadership and Democratic Decision Making",
