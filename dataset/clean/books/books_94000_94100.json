        "Title": "Owning Up: Poverty, Assets, and the American Dream",
        "Authors": "By Miller-Adams, Michelle",
        "Description": "Despite the recent success of welfare reform in moving people off public assistance and into jobs, most of America's working poor are still unable to accumulate even the most minimal of assets. Even when they are getting by, they lack many of the resources&#151;tangible and intangible&#151;that provide middle-class Americans with a sense of security, stability, and a stake in the future. In  Owning Up, Michelle Miller-Adams demonstrates how asset-building programs, used in combination with traditional income-based support, can be an effective means for helping millions of American out of poverty.  Miller-Adams expands the traditional concept of assets to encompass a range of tools, experiences, resources, and support systems that are necessary if asset building is to serve as an effective anti-poverty strategy. She identifies four types of assets that can represent sources of wealth for low-income individuals and communities: economic human social, and natural assets. Economic assets include equity, retirement savings, and other financial holdings. Human assets include education, knowledge, skills, and talents. Included among social assets are the networks of trust and reciprocity that bind communities together. Natural assets include the land, water, air and other natural resources we depend on for survival.  Owning Up also examines five organizations at the forefront of building assets for the poor. Their stories are told through the eyes of individuals whose lives they have helped transform. These organizations have all developed effective strategies for building assets, and Miller-Adams identifies them as models to be emulated elsewhere.   The profiled organizations include:   Neighborhoods Incorporated of Battle Creek, Michigan. Its innovative strategies seek to increase home ownership and promote neighborhood revitalization in poor communities.   The Watershed Research and Training Center. This local organization strengthens the natural resource-based economy by retraining workers and strengthening social ties.   The Private Industry Partnership of Wildcat Service Corporation. Based in New York City, PIP trains former welfare recipients in New York City for entry-level white collar jobs.   Iowa's Institute for Social and Economic Development. This microenterprise development organization is one of the largest U.S. based organizations training low-income entrepreneurs.   The Corporation for Enterprise Development. CFED, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that has been instrumental in showing that poor people can and will save if given the opportunities and incentives for doing so. They have helped put Individual Development Accounts on the national agenda.",

        "Authors": "By Ravenel, Shannon (EDT) and Brown, Larry (FRW)",
        "Description": "As Larry Brown explains in this year's preface, This is all that I have, this land called North Mississippi, home of my father, and grand-fathers, and great-grandfathers, and luckily for me, it turns out to be always enough. It's that land and everything around it-the intractable clay soil, the twisting rivers, the air heavy with humidity-that makes the South a character in its own right, and that permeates this year's collection. The stories in the seventeenth volume of New Stories from the South begin with the land or the water or the weather, but it's their depth and richness that take us somewhere altogether new-the South, seen from a wholly new perspective, as if for the first time. From the mountains of Tennessee to the suburbs of New Orleans to a hollowed-out antebellum house to the center of Texas, this year's New Stories from the South turns out to be always enough. Nineteen writers make their mark in this year's volume: Dwight Allen, Russell Banks, Brad Barkley, Doris Betts, William Gay, Aaron Gwyn, Ingrid Hill, David Koon, Andrea Lee, Romulus Linney, Corey Mesler, Lucia Nevai, Julie Orringer, Dulane Upshaw Ponder, Bill Roorbach, George Singleton, Kate Small, R. T. Smith, and Max Steele. Each story is followed by the author's notes about its origin. Readers will also find an updated list of the magazines consulted by Ravenel and a complete list of all the stories selected each year since the series' inception in 1986.",

        "Authors": "By Lappe, Frances Moore, Burton, Rachel (CON), Lappe, Anna (CON), and Richardson, Hope (CON)",
        "Description": "Three out of five Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, feel our country is headed in the wrong direction. America is at the edge, a critical place at which we can either renew and revitalize or give in and lose that most precious American ideal\u2014democracy\u2014and along with it the freedom, fairness, and opportunities it assures. Democracy\u2019s Edge is a rousing battle cry that we can\u2014and must\u2014act now.\u00a0 From Jefferson to Eisenhower, presidents from both parties have warned us of the danger of letting a closed, narrow group of business and government officials concentrate power over our lives. Yet today, a small and unrepresentative group of people is making vital decisions for all of us.But this crisis is only a symptom, Lapp\u00e9 argues. It\u2019s a symptom of thin democracy, something done to us or for us, not by or with us. Such democracy is always at risk of being stolen by private interests or extremist groups, left and right.\u00a0\u00a0But there is a solution. The answer, says Lapp\u00e9, is Living Democracy, a powerful yet often invisible citizens\u2019 revolution surging in communities across America. It\u2019s not random, disjointed activism but the emergence of a new historical stage of democracy in which Americans realize that democracy isn\u2019t something we have but something we do. Either we live it or lose it, says Lapp\u00e9.",

Yet the telling of each story can ease the                 footsteps of those who follow\u2026. It is my hope that                 [these] tales will offer you camaraderie, a guidepost here and                 there, and, most of all, the heart and strength to pursue your                 own path.\u201d\u2014from the Introduction             What draws Jews back to their religious                 roots? What drives them away? What obstacles must they overcome                 to find their way home?             Paula Amann candidly probes these                 questions and more as she explores how secular and nominal Jews                 are blazing their own trails toward a vibrant,                 twenty-first-century Judaism. With the ear of a journalist and                 the heart of a seeker, Amann weaves a tapestry of human                 stories\u2014of alienation, connection, spiritual detours, and                 unexpected portals into a life of faith. The people you meet in                 this engaging book will throw a fresh light on Jewish thought                 and practice.

Not just a reporter, he brings a wealth of firsthand, frontline, experience to every issue he tackles.\"\u2014Barbara Ehrenreich\"This is must reading for anyone who wants to know how we got us into this financial mess\u2014and what it will take to get out of it.\"\u2014Katrina vanden Heuvel\"In order to comprehend the entirety of our nation\u2019s economic system, an understanding of working-class Americans and the labor movement is absolutely essential. Nobody understands that better than Jonathan Tasini. His writing is infused with a thorough knowledge of not only labor, but how corporate greed is at the root of the recent economic collapse.\u201d\u2014James P. Hoffa, General President, International Brotherhood of Teamsters\"Jonathan Tasini dares to utter the words that are still not said in \"polite\" company: The G-word: Greed! The T-word: Theft! No, greed is not good. Enriching oneself by taking the money of others and leaving them poor: that's theft. Tasini shows us the economy as we need to see it-from the perspective of people who work.\"\u2014George Lakoff,author of The Political Mind and Don't Think of an Elephant!Over the past quarter century, we have lived through the greatest looting of wealth in human history. While billions of dollars streamed into the pockets of a few elites in the corporate and economic class, the vast majority of citizens have lived through a period of falling wages, disappearing pensions, and dwindling bank accounts\u2014all of which lead to the personal debt crisis that lies at the root of the current financial meltdown. This \"audacity of greed\" was legally blessed by the ethos of the \"free market,\" a phony marketing phrase that covered up the fleecing of the American public.In The Audacity of Greed, Jonathan Tasini examines the reasons and exposes the people responsible for the looting of America\u2014from Wall Street executives who funded their lavish lifestyles at the public's expense to the politicians who let it happen\u2014arguing that we need a cultural and philosophical revolution that punctures the fable of market fundamentalism and, by doing so, values the contributions made by ordinary Americans throughout the economy.Jonathan Tasini is executive director of the Labor Research Association. The longtime president of the National Writers Union, he was the lead plaintiff in Tasini vs. The New York Times, the landmark electronic rights case that took on the corporate media's assault on the rights of freelance authors. In 2006 he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the US Senate in New York. He has written about labor and economics for a variety of publications including The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post,  Los Angeles Times, and The Wall Street Journal, and has appeared on CNBC and Fox News.",

        "Description": "The 2002 No Child Left Behind Act is the most important legislation in American education since the 1960s. The law requires states to put into place a set of standards together with a comprehensive testing plan designed to ensure these standards are met. Students at schools that fail to meet those standards may leave for other schools, and schools not progressing adequately become subject to reorganization. The significance of the law lies less with federal dollar contributions than with the direction it gives to federal, state, and local school spending. It helps codify the movement toward common standards and school accountability.    Yet NCLB will not transform American schools overnight. The first scholarly assessment of the new legislation, No Child Left Behind? breaks new ground in the ongoing debate over accountability. Contributors examine the law's origins, the political and social forces that gave it shape, the potential issues that will surface with its implementation, and finally, the law's likely consequences for American education.",

        "Description": "Islam as a religion is central to the lives of over a billion people, but its outer expression as a distinctive civilization has been undergoing a monumental crisis. Buffeted by powerful adverse currents, Islamic civilization today is a shadow of its former self. The most disturbing and possibly fatal of these currents\u2014the imperial expansion of the West into Muslim lands and the blast of modernity that accompanied it\u2014are now compounded by a third giant wave, globalization.These forces have increasingly tested Islam and Islamic civilization for validity, adaptability, and the ability to hold on to the loyalty of Muslims, says Ali A. Allawi in his provocative new book. While the faith has proved resilient in the face of these challenges, other aspects of Islamic civilization have atrophied or died, Allawi contends, and Islamic civilization is now undergoing its last crisis.The book explores how Islamic civilization began to unravel under colonial rule, as its institutions, laws, and economies were often replaced by inadequate modern equivalents. Allawi also examines the backlash expressed through the increasing religiosity of Muslim societies and the spectacular rise of political Islam and its terrorist offshoots. Assessing the status of each of the building blocks of Islamic civilization, the author concludes that Islamic civilization cannot survive without the vital spirituality that underpinned it in the past. He identifies a key set of principles for moving forward, principles that will surprise some and anger others, yet clearly must be considered.",

Imagine abandoning your life to Jesus instead of trying to save yourself. Can you imagine exchanging your fears for that peace that passes understanding? Being relaxed and free instead of stressed-out and anxious? If you can imagine enjoying God instead of trying to repay him, then you can imagine grace.So go ahead!

Using copious examples from his practice, Steven Levenkron traces the factors that predispose a personality to self-mutilation: genetics, family experience, childhood trauma, and parental behavior. Written for sufferers, parents, friends, and therapists, Cutting explains why the disorder manifests in self-harming behaviors and describes how patients can be helped.",

In every Nazioccupied Country, at every level of society, there were non-Jews who had the courage to resist. From the king of Denmark, refusing to force Jewish Danes to wear yellow stars, to the Dutch student, registering Jewish babies as Gentiles and hiding children in her home, a small number of people had the strength to reject the inhumanity they were ordered to support. Here are their stories: thrilling, terrifying, and most of all, inspiring. For in the horror that was the Holocaust, some human decency could still shine through. \"There are no Rambo-style heroics here, just short accounts of quiet bravery. It is an inspiring testimonial.\"--The San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle\u2018A companion to Never to Forget,  this is the story of those gentiles who sought to rescue their Jewish neighbors from annihilation during World War II.  Succeeding chapters describe the efforts of Germans, Poles, Danes, and others to save Jewish friends and strangers from the Nazis. A story that needs telling.\" 'SLJ.

Since he returned home to Washington, D.C. after serving in Iraq, he has been doing special investigations for a defense attorney. He's good at it, and he has carved out a niche: recovering stolen property, no questions asked. His cut is forty percent. A high-profile crime boss who has heard of Lucas's specialty hires him to find out who has been stealing from his operation. It's the biggest job Spero has ever been offered, and he quickly gets a sense of what's going on. But before he can close in on what's been taken, he tangles with a world of men whose amorality and violence leave him reeling. Is any cut worth your family, your lover, your life? The first in a series of thrillers featuring Spero Lucas, The Cut is the latest confirmation of why George Pelecanos is \"perhaps America's greatest living crime writer.\" (Stephen King)",
