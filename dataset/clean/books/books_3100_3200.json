        "Description": "MAKE A SOUND INVESTMENT IN CLASSICAL MUSICWho are the ten most important classical composers? Who in the world was Palestrina? Why did Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\" cause a riot? Which five of each important composer's works should you buy? What is a concerto and how does it differ from a sonata?Maybe you don't know the answers to these questions; author Phil Goulding certainly didn't. When Goulding first tried to learn about classical music, he found himself buried in an avalanche of technical terms and complicated jargon--so he decided to write the book he couldn't find.The result is a complete classical music education in one volume. Comprehensive, discriminating, and delightfully irreverent, Classical Music provides such essential information as:* Rankings of the top 50 composers (Bach is #1. Borodin is #50) * A detailed and anecdotal look at each composer's life and work * The five primary works of each composer and specific recommended CDs for each. * Further great works of each composer--if you really like him * Concise explanations of musical terminology, forms, and periods * A guide to the parts and history of the symphony orchestra \"This book uses every conceivable gimmick to immerse readers in the richness of classical music: lists, rankings, sidebars devoted to lively anecdotes, and catchy leads.\"--The Washington Post\"One terrific music appreciation book...The information is surprisingly detailed but concisely presented. Goulding's writing style is breezy yet mature....[He] has raised music appreciation from a racket to a service.\"--The Arizona Daily Star",

        "Title": "A Girl Could Stand Up: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Marshall, Leslie",
        "Description": "A debut novel of startling originality that follows a young girl's passionate and eccentric quest for invincibility, courage, trust, and love.Leslie Marshall's first novel is a startling, fresh, totally captivating new voice. With Elray Mayhew, she has created perhaps one of literature's more unforgettable young heroines. Elray Mayhew loses her parents on her sixth birthday at an amusement park going through the Tunnel of Love. The boat the three of them are in is leaking and Barkely and Jack's feet are on the wet floor so that when the electrical moon falls from the ceiling and into their laps, they are electrocuted. Elray survives intact except for a crescent shaped scar on her right underarm. In following years she can touch the scar and communicate with them, receiving instructions, or offbeat and amusing comments, in their distinctive voices.Elray, orphaned, is now in the custody of two uncles, brothers each of Barkley and Jack. Harwood is a macho, heavily-drinking photographer who travels about the world on assignments. Aunt Ajax, as he prefers to be called, is a cross-dressing gay man who gives up his fringe existence in New York to come to Washington, move into Barkley and Jack's old house in the Cleveland Park, and throw himself full throttle into motherhood, albeit, at times, a misguided version of it.Elray doesn't speak for days and spends most of her time hiding in a crawlspace under the house. During a gathering after her parent's funeral she's there, listening to everyone shuffle above her and hearing them call her name, when she lets out her second massive scream. It's her voice returning, her Aunt Ajax, one of her new official guardians, runs to check on her. Following her is her Uncle Harwood, official guardian #2. The three of them, camped out under the house, decide to mark the day as Crawlspace Day. Crawlspace Day will be celebrated annually to mark the day that their lives became entwined, and she'll receive, belatedly, her cake and her gifts, all under the house.By the time she's twelve, Elray is spending all her time creating adventures and going on solo explorations. One day, creeping through the crypts of the Washington Cathedral that is near Half-Moon Street, she comes eye to eye with Raoul Person, a boy just her age as awkward, precocious, and alone as she is. Their story is the beating heart of this novel. They connect immediately, and together they form a partnership to practice \"the art of invincibility\"-something they'd both been trying to conquer-and christen themselves The Invincible Heels. He's her fellow knight and from crafting amateur black and white movies, to imitating their actual deaths in makeshift coffins, to a harrowing midnight swim across the Potomac when Elray just escapes drowning, they challenge each other to confront their fears.Although they remain close, as they move into the period termed \"The Vertical Bog\"-Elray's wry code for puberty-they drift apart. Her interest in filmmaking deepens, and Raoul begins running after the girly-girls. Elray withdraws, mourns Raoul, and hears less and less from her parents when she touches her scar-she's growing up. She still feels like a failure after their harrowing crossing of the Potomac, combined with typical low self-esteem of her age group, she decides to master her largest fear-going back to Glen Echo and riding again through the Tunnel of Love. Harwood accompanies her, and afterwards, she finally feels like a young adult.And happening all at the same time, Elray's paternal grandmother-long thought dead-resurfaces and sues for custody of her granddaughter (she claims to have faked her death in a fire at Blackie's House of Beef to free her family from her destructive drinking and gambling ways). Elray, at this fragile stage in her life, delights in the weirdness of the situation and welcomes the elegant, grand, smoking and dancing old woman, while unwittingly betraying her family by dis",

        "Authors": "By Greve, Michael S.",
        "Description": "\"Real\" federalism, Michael S. Greve argues, is a federalism that promotes citizen choice and competition among the states. Far from being an anachronism in an increasingly complex society, a regime that permits citizens to choose among competing jurisdictions - each offering a different mixture of government services - is uniquely suited to a country of highly mobile and increasingly sophisticated citizen-consumers.Real Federalism provides a road map for reviving citizen choice and state competition. Greve shows how the Supreme Court, which has reestablished at least some federalism constraints, and a loose coalition of \"leave-us-alone\" constituencies - including some religious groups, home school and school choice organizations, and term limit and tax limit advocates - can through a \"virtuous cycle\" of progressive accommodation and cooperation succeed in advancing federalism.",

Mencken, the famous iconoclastic journalist, as amateur detectives. Two Baltimore reporters (friends at that time and later in real life), they are investigating the deaths and sex scandals in the Harding administration in 1923, just before the big Teapot Dome scandal breaks.There is a remarkable relevance of 1920s scandals to today's political environment, but that remains behind the book as Mencken and Cain, two bright literary men playing Holmes and Watson, take the train to D.C. to get the real scoop. They drink a lot, meet a mysterious, sexy redhead named Roxy (a real-life influence on Cain) and a rogue named Gaston B. Means, and get a lot more than they bargained for. With hard-boiled enthusiasm they expose some of the roots of the corruption infecting our capital. All the speaking roles are real historical characters.",

        "Description": "After fifty years as observer and participant on the front lines of the civil rights movement, Harry Ashmore finds the nation still unable, or unwilling, to face up to the basic issues posed in Gunnar Myrdal's classic An American Dilemma. In this memoir, Ashmore takes up where Myrdal left off in 1944, giving us a retrospective view of the causes and effects of the post-World War II civil rights movement, considering it in the context of the political developments that both advanced and hindered its effectiveness.As executive editor of the Arkansas Gazette, Ashmore led the fight against Governor Orval Faubus when he closed Little Rock's Central High School in defiance of the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. As the protest by blacks spread across the nation, Ashmore was present at the heart of the action as journalist, academic, foundation executive, and adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. He has won Pulitzer Prizes for himself and his newspaper and has produced a body of work that makes up a unique chronicle of a turbulent era.Civil Rights and Wrongs is a powerful and important reappraisal of the American Dilemma by a man who has viewed it from the eye of the storm it has spawned.",

        "Authors": "By morgan, dan",
        "Description": "Like the Joads of Steinbeck's unforgettable The Grapes of Wrath, Oca Tatham and his family trekked west with the millions of Americans who fled the Great Depression in search of jobs and hope in California. Rising in the West presents the magnificent story of what became of this family, and opens a fascinating, heretofore almost unchronicled chapter of American experience.Drawing on years of intensive historical research, as well as countless interviews with family, friends, and associates, Dan Morgan gives us the Tathams' remarkable lives in absorbing detail. In less than half a century, they went from migrant fruit-picking to middle-class prosperity in the promised land of California, where they got caught up in the quintessential realities of the Sun Belt: agribusiness, irrigation projects, the defense industry, real-estate development, nursing home chains, and football franchises. But like so many white Southerners who went west coming from nothing, the Tathams remained outsiders. As individualistic Christians ever wary of mainstream American life and skeptical of mainstream notions of success, they found their place in that cohesive Sun Belt culture whose religious, ethical, and political outlook would form the basis of the New Populism that manifested itself so dramatically in the Reagan Revolution.More than anything else, fundamentalist Pentecostalism is at the heart of the Tathams' experience. The brush arbors and storefront churches of Oca's youth are linked by generations of deep religious commitment to the huge revivalist tabernacles that dot southern California. While the family has always been bound together by the fervor of their faith, Morgan shows how that faith is being tested today, not only as the Tathams confront inevitable family adversities like alcoholism, terminal illness, and troubled marriages, but also as they, and others like them, take their stand on the deeply divisive issues - including abortion and school prayer - topping the national agenda, and leave their profound stamp on American politics.Rising in the West is an extraordinary achievement - an engrossing account of the growth of America, as well as the intensely personal drama of a family struggling to keep faith with itself.",

Waiting for her is LAPD detective Mike Flint - and a case that will take her into the urban war zone of South Central L.A. There, a cop killing solved years before has reverberated through the lives of the three black children who witnessed it, one the son of the man convicted of the murder.Fifteen years later the long-dead case comes back to life, exploding in the media with a bang. A ruthless politician has decided to get the minority vote by claiming the police coerced the children into pointing a finger at Charles Conklin, an innocent man. Conklin's son, deprived of a father's guidance, has ended up in Juvenile Hall charged with a murder of his own. It is a situation sure to ignite sparks of protest in a tinderbox city - and bring Mike Flint's career down in flames.With her dreams newly joined to Mike's, Maggie begins her own campaign to clear his name, and the gutsy, prize-winning filmmaker is taking her camera and sleuthing skills into the heart of an embattled city. But beneath the smoggy L.A. skies, layer after layer of lies make the truth look out of focus around the edges. With her video running, Maggie captures the stark faces of shattered lives and the bodies that turn up. This is the real picture of cops and crime, politics and justice, poverty and dead-end streets where the savvy Maggie hopes to find the solution to a devastating mystery - or lose what is dearest to her heart.Intelligent, multilayered, and filled with surprises, this no-holds-barred suspenseful mystery showcases Wendy Hornsby's cinematic eye for detail and her wise perspective on the inner city - with its all-too-human crimes of passion, rage, and broken dreams.",

There is Rumpole's encounter with the acting world, his frequent and often disillusioning brushes with the Timsons, and many of his confrontations with the pompous and sometimes misguided gentlemen of the Bench.For those unfamiliar with Rumpole, this volume offers a perfect introduction to John Mortimer's wisest and wittiest creation. Those who have already encountered Rumpole will want to reacquaint themselves with the immortal barrister in this hugely entertaining collection of stories.",

        "Authors": "By Davidson, Cathy N. (EDT), Wagner-Martin, Linda (EDT), and Ammons, Elizabeth (EDT)",
        "Description": "From Anne Bradstreet's The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America in the seventeenth century, to Toni Morrison's Nobel Prize in 1993, women writers have woven a rich tapestry of voices across four centuries of American history. Their writings have embraced a marvelous diversity of visions, including those of Emily Dickinson, Gertrude Stein, Cynthia Ozick, Gwendolyn Brooks, Kate Chopin, Maya Angelou, Annie Dillard, Joan Didion, Edith Wharton, Adrienne Rich, Djuna Barnes, and Willa Cather.The Oxford Companion to Women's Writing in the United States provides a comprehensive, authoritative, and highly informative survey of these writers and their work as it illuminates the issues that fired their imaginations.Here is a goldmine of information about women's writing, women's history, and women's concerns--over eight hundred entries, ranging from brief identifications to extensive essays. The volume boasts contributions by many well-known thinkers, including Susan Faludi writing on backlash, Deborah Tannen on communications between the sexes, Jane Gallop on Lacanian psychoanalysis, Nell Irvin Painter on Sojourner Truth, and Trudier Harris on Toni Morrison. There are nearly four hundred biographical entries, touching on not only important poets, novelists, and playwrights (including such modern figures as Wendy Wasserstein, Anne Tyler, Alice Walker, and Tama Janowitz), but also women writers who have made important contributions in other fields, such as Betty Friedan, Rachel Carson, Margaret Mead, Aimee Semple McPherson, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony. Perhaps most important, there is extensive coverage of the many personal, cultural, and historical issues that have been explored by and have influenced the lives and productivity of women writers, including AIDS, race and racism, violence and sexual harassment, the Civil War, the civil rights movement, and much more. There is also coverage of the publishing world (including bookstores and women's presses), the art and practice of writing, and contemporary literary criticism (including lesbian literary theory, black feminism, and deconstruction).The women who have written beautifully, poignantly, tenderly, humorously, or powerfully about America and American lives are indeed a heterogeneous group.The Oxford Companion to Women's Writing in the United States captures this remarkable diversity, painting a fascinating portrait of women and women's writing in America.",

        "Title": "Eddy Arnold: Pioneer of the Nashville Sound",
        "Authors": "By Streissguth, Michael",
        "Description": "Eddy Arnold was just a sweet-voiced, third-generation cotton farmer from Western Tennessee with a dream: to lift himself out of rural poverty and make a name for himself as a country performer. This book traces the history of the Arnold family to a Confederate soldier named Robert M. Arnold, who began farming cotton in the Henderson region after the war. His son, Will, wed twice; his second wife, Georgia, gave birth to Richard Edward Arnold in 1918.After the stock market crash, Will Arnold lost ownership of his farm, and young Ed was less than happy working as a tenant farmer for absentee owners. An avid amateur guitarist, he soon had paying jobs at dances and gatherings around the area; inspired to go further afield, he traveled up the road to Jackson, Tennessee, where he garnered his first radio job. Meanwhile, he worked daytimes for an undertaker to help make ends meet.Forming a duo with fiddler Howard \"Speedy\" McNatt, they moved from station to station, in search of the elusive perfect homebase. They got as far as St. Louis, where their local popularity blossomed. A chance audition with radio cowboy star Pee Wee King led the duo to join King's successful band, and even greater fame for the smooth-voiced Tennessee songster. With King's band, Eddy honed his professional chops, was introduced to a wide audience via Nashville's \"Grand Ole Opry\" radio program, and met the legendary and flamboyant manager Colonel Tom Parker, who would greatly influence his career.Breaking away as a solo act, Eddy signed with Victor Records toward the end of World War II, and formed his first, highly influential band, featuring fiddler McNatt, \"Little\" Roy Wiggins on steel guitar, and bassist Gabe Tucker. His first hits were sentimental ballads, and by the late '40s he was one of Victor's top-selling artists and a consistent concert draw. His popularity was so great that he became a welcome figure on national radio and television in the mid-'50s.Then, a new sound shook the airwaves: Rock and roll. The market for Eddy's smooth country style diminished, and Eddy faced some lean times. Determined to crossover into the mainstream pop market, he experimented with a variety of styles until, in the early '60s, he hit on a perfect blend of country sentiments with uptown accompaniments. The result was a string of mid-'60s hits, highlighted by the classic \"Make the World Go Away.\" Eddy Arnold was a star all over again - and this time on the mainstream stage.",

And nationally renowned  physician Dale A. Matthews offers a program any patient can follow to incorporate faith into their own healing.Dr. Matthews points out that encouraging an integration of religious beliefs and practices in medical settings can have important benefits for the entire medical community, from patients and doctors to national health policy makers. He shows how the national trend toward rediscovering religious values has led many patients to use prayer in conjunction with conventional treatment, and that the results have already confirmed that faith and religious practice can be valuable medicine. Finally, Dr. Matthews helps readers explore the connection between faith and medicine in their own lives through methods of prayer, community worship, and study of Scripture.",

Elizabeth, Queen of England, has taken on the mighty Spanish Armada and, in a stunning sea battle, vanquished it.But her troubles are far from over. At home she is challenged at every turn by the brilliant but reckless Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, whose dangerous mix of passion and political ambition drives the aging queen to distraction. Just across the western channel, her colony Ireland is embroiled in seething rebellion, the island's fierceuntamed clan chieftains and their \"wild Irish\" followers refusing to bow to their English oppressors.In the midst of the conflict is Grace O'Malley, notorious pirate, gunrunner, and \"Mother of the Irish Rebellion.\" For years, the audacious Grace has plotted and fought against the English stranglehold on her beloved country. At the height of the uprising Grace takes an outrageous risk, sailing up the River Thames to London for a face-to-face showdown with her nemesis, the Queen of England.The historic meeting of these two female titans --perfectly matched in guts, guile, and political genius -- sets the stage for the telling of the little-known but crucial saga of Elizabeth's Irish war, a conflict at the very root of every subsequent Irish uprising. No one breathes life into these strong and pugnacious women as does Robin Maxwell in this captivating novel, a rousing tale that makes historygloriously real.",
