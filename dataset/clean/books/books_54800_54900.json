By all means, visit the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall -- the historic district can still inspire even the most jaded Philadelphian. But this guide will also help you uncover houses that still have bullet holes and bloodstains from the Revolutionary War; churches where the graveyards out back hold statuary worthy of a museum; and an abandoned prison that's become a venue for the arts. It's these odds and ends that this book explores, along with worthy restaurants, shops, collections, and gardens often missed by those who stick to the trail well trod.",

After fifty-two days in the hold of a tanker from Algeria, he jumps into the icy waters of Boston harbor and swims to shore. Seemingly rescued from isolation by Algerians he knew as a child, he instead finds himself in a world of disillusionment, duplicity, and stolen identities, living a raw comedy of daily survival not unlike what he fled back home.As the story of Aziz and his friends unfolds - moving from the hardscrabble neighborhoods of East Boston and Brooklyn to a North African army camp - Harbor makes vivid the ambiguities of these men's past and present lives: burying a murdered girl in the Sahara, reading medieval Persian poetry on a bus, passing for Mexican, shoplifting Versace for clubbing, succumbing to sex in a public library, impersonating a double agent. But when Aziz begins to suspect that he and his friends are under surveillance, all assumptions - his and ours - dissolve in an urgent, mesmerizing complexity. And as Harbor races to its explosive conclusion, it compels us to question the questions it raises: Who are the terrorists? Can we recognize them? How do they live?",

But history also records other information about Judas Iscariot. One such reference was written in 180 by an influential Church Father named St. Irenaeus who railed against the Gospel of Judas for depicting the last days of Jesus from the perspective of the disgraced apostle. In its pages, Judas is Christ\u2019s favorite. It\u2019s a startlingly different story than the one handed down through the ages. Once it was denounced as heresy, the Gospel of Judas faded from sight. It became one of history\u2019s forgotten manuscripts. Until now.In this compelling and exhaustively researched account, Herbert Krosney unravels how the Gospel of Judas was found and its meaning painstakingly teased from the ancient Coptic script that had hid its message for centuries. With all the skills of an investigative journalist and master storyteller, Krosney traces the forgotten gospel\u2019s improbable journey across three continents, a trek that would take it through the netherworld of the international antiquities trade, until the crumbling papyrus is finally made to give up its secrets. The race to discover the Gospel of Judas will go down as one of the great detective stories of biblical archaeology.",

She has been considered the next great hope for American track and field since she was fourteen. At sixteen, she made the U.S. Olympic team. Nike has created a shoe for her, Annie Leibovitz has photographed her, and the world is watching to see if she'll be the first person ever to win five gold medals in track at the Olympics.  Marion Jones is faster than any woman alive, but where did she come from and where is she going?  Ron Rapoport's biography of the woman the New York Times called \"the most prominent track athlete on the planet\" is a remarkable profile of a woman not at the end of her athletic career, but at the beginning. It's the story of a season at the highest level of sport, and the triumphs and tragedies of Jones's quest to win four gold medals at the 1999 World Championships, the gateway to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.  Her story is also that of an American girl born into a society just beginning to make room for women on its playing fields. She played baseball, basketball. She ran. She grew tall and beautiful and strong. She led he college basketball team to a national championship. But it was running that she loved; she could run faster than anyone.  Rapoport follows Jones from meet to meet during the 1999 outdoor track season, a witness to her domination. With unprecedented access to Jones, her colleagues, family, friends and foes, Rapoport artfully presents the stories of a world-class athlete whose quest began as the dream of a little girl.",

        "Description": "Is this a great country or what? You can bet on the turn of the card, a roll of the dice\u2014but also the NFL, the NCAA, and which Olson twin marries first. We bet $80 million a year, the amount growing wildly as more and more people gain access to this huge American wheel of fortune. No longer quarantined in Las Vegas, gambling has become as local as our neighborhood cineplex. It's no wonder that we spend more money gambling than we do on movies, music, sports, video games, and theme parks combined! If there's not a casino around the corner, there's one on your laptop computer. In Jackpot Nation, acclaimed Sports Illustrated writer Richard Hoffer takes us on a headlong tour, alternately horrifying and hilarious, across our landscape of luck, discovering just how ridiculously determined we are to gamble. Whether he's trying to win a side of bacon in a Minnesota bar, hustling a paper sack filled with $100,000 cash across Las Vegas parking lots, poring over expansion plans with a tribal chief in California, or visiting a retired bus salesman with a poor understanding of three-game parlays in his New York prison cell, Hoffer finds a national inclination\u2014a cultural predisposition, even\u2014to take a chance.Hoffer shows us how Americans\u2014adventurers at heart\u2014have embraced this ability to take recreational risks with a surprising gusto. But as he pokes into this country's far corners, traveling coast to coast with odds as his copilot, he uncovers more than just the playful exercise of that age-old fantasy\u2014something for nothing. He discovers that the very institutions that used to regulate this workout are now its biggest cheerleaders. Whereas government, religion, and business once restricted our ability to gamble, making it  taboo even, they have now taken ownership of the pastime. Yesterday's numbers racket is today's state lottery; yesterday's mobbed-up casino is now part of a Fortune 500 company. It's one thing to recognize the house edge, but sometimes it's quite another to figure out who actually owns the house.Still, Hoffer manages to find the fun in all this, as equally delighted with the delirium of a slot machine trade show as the religious risk of an underground poker game, almost right beneath the spires of the Mormon Tabernacle. He concludes that people are, mostly, having a good time. If he also uncovers a downside\u2014the outlandish vigorish that comes with its growing acceptance\u2014well, that's why they call it gambling.",

Success comes from having passion and having fun creating your objective!Words of Wisdom is a collection of inspirational aphorisms, which Rev Run sends out to his closest friends each day and which were made suddenly popular when his television show zoomed to the top of the MTV charts. Rev Run (an ordained minister) closes each episode of Run's House by reading philosophical, Christian, and inspirational books in the bathtub before penning words that inspire, encourage, and motivate. Here, available for the first time to the public, are Run's Words of Wisdom published in a gifty yet affordable format just in time for the show's second season. All great blessings come from being at peace. When the day is over, go to sleep. Never sit up worrying about tomorrow. Work hard and let God do the rest. I always say these words at night: \"I can sleep tonight because God is awake!\" Relax. Rest easy.",

When Kelley first visited the church well into his forties,  he was searching for a respite from urban malaise and found himself  filled with disquieting questions: How could he reconcile his  convictions with the central purpose of the church-to worship a God he  didn't believe in? Could he say the prayers and sing the hymns while  remaining an honest skeptic?After fifteen years of full  participation in a church that is open not only to skeptics but also to  gay men and lesbians, blacks and Jews, where members are invited to  critique Sunday sermons, and where hymns are rewritten to reflect  feminist concerns, Kelley found that his agnosticism remained but his  skepticism about church participation had disappeared. Modern urban life  can be a sterile, isolating experience. Yet in St. Mark's Kelley  discovered a place of vibrant community, honest inquiry, and support  over the hard places in life.",

Dreams could be the key to figuring out what's happening in their lives--but only if they can properly decode the symbols, images, and actions that play out in their unconscious minds every night. Adult dream dictionaries may miss the mark, because they don't pay attention to what matters most to girls. For example, how many would include entries on \"acne\" or \"allowances\"? And some words have different implications for kids than grown-ups: \"zero\" might represent fears about a school project, for example. Now, there's a guide just for teenagers, with advice on how to tailor the interpretations to their own personal situation. Scary and threatening explanations are out, along with concepts and events that may not be relevant or easily grasped by young people. Instead, they'll find comforting guidance and a path to self-understanding. From \"abandonment\" and \"abnormality\" to \"zipper\" and \"zoo,\" these wise and wonderful analyses will lead to some real girl power!",

It is an inspiring, thrilling saga of everyday people forced by their hearts\u2019 passion to fight in the war against tyranny.By 1938, hundreds of Italian intellectuals, lawyers and journalists, university professors and scientists had escaped Mussolini\u2019s fascist government and taken refuge in Paris. There, amid the struggles of \u00e9migr\u00e9 life, they founded an Italian resistance, with an underground press that smuggled news and encouragement back to Italy. Fighting fascism with typewriters, they produced 512 clandestine newspapers. The Foreign Correspondent is their story.Paris, a winter night in 1938: a murder/suicide at a discreet lovers\u2019 hotel. But this is no romantic traged\u2013it is the work of the OVRA, Mussolini\u2019s fascist secret police, and is meant to eliminate the editor of Liberazione, a clandestine \u00e9migr\u00e9 newspaper. Carlo Weisz, who has fled from Trieste and secured a job as a foreign correspondent with the Reuters bureau, becomes the new editor. Weisz is, at that moment, in Spain, reporting on the last campaign of the Spanish civil war. But as soon as he returns to Paris, he is pursued by the French S\u00fbret\u00e9, by agents of the OVRA, and by officers of the British Secret Intelligence Service. In the desperate politics of Europe on the edge of war, a foreign correspondent is a pawn, worth surveillance, or blackmail, or murder. The Foreign Correspondent is the story of Carlo Weisz and a handful of antifascists: the army officer known as \u201cColonel Ferrara,\u201d who fights for a lost cause in Spain; Arturo Salamone, the shrewd leader of a resistance group in Paris; and Christa von Schirren, the woman who becomes the love of Weisz\u2019s life, herself involved in a doomed resistance underground in Berlin.The Foreign Correspondent is Alan Furst at his absolute best\u2013taut and powerful, enigmatic and romantic, with sharp, seductive writing that takes the reader through darkness and intrigue to a spectacular denouement.",

        "Title": "Catholics In Crisis: An American Parish Fights For Its Soul",
        "Authors": "By Naughton, Jim",
        "Description": "Polls illustrating the gulf between the Roman Catholic Church and its American flock appear with numbing frequency. But behind the statistics are millions of people struggling to reconcile their lives with their faith. Catholics in Crisis is a vivid portrayal of this struggle, told through the narrative frame of a single, albeit highly influential, parish.Holy Trinity in Washington, D.C., one of the most prominent and popular churches in the nation, has long enjoyed a reputation as a place where post-Vatican II Catholicism is at its most vital. It is also a community in which American dissent from Vatican teaching is clearly articulated. But when a lone parishioner stands up through a Sunday Mass to protest the exclusion of women from the priesthood, he ignites a fire-storm of controversy that exposes deep rifts and threatens to tear the community apart.The Standing, as it came to be called, is but one of the stories that Jim Naughton skillfully weaves together as he examines the issues that can divide parents and children, husbands and wives, priests and the laity, Rome and America. The rich cast of characters includes: the pastor of Holy Trinity\u2014deeply spiritual, charismatic, and about to leave the church; the female director of liturgy, caught between liberal and conservative factions; a parishioner and parent, who is appalled at the CCD program that he feels substitutes liberal platitudes for Catholic truth; a young priest, who is struggling with his vow of celibacy; a powerful bishop, who believes that Holy Trinity goes out of its way to flout Church rubrics, and is determined to bring it to heel; and a handful of others who play out the realities of divorce, remarriage, abortion, and premarital sex against the background the church\u2019s teachings.",

A seemingly respectable retired Englishman, living in a flat on the Via Maggio near the Santa Trinita bridge, was shot in the back during the night.  He was well-connected and Scotland Yard has despatched two officers to \"assist\" the Italians in solving the crime. But it is the marshal, a quiet observer, not an intellectual, who manages to figure out what happened, and why. In addition to the wonderful atmosphere of Florence, Magdalen Nabb has created a delightful investigator who has been described as \"the most Maigret-like of contemporary policemen\" by the  Times Literary Supplement .",

A registered nurse, pecan grower, university housemother, Peace Corps volunteer, public speaker, and renowned raconteur, Miss Lillian ignored the mores and prejudices of the racially segregated South of the Great Depression years. She was an avid supporter of the Brooklyn Dodgers (because she happened to attend the first major league baseball game in which Jackie Robinson, from Cairo, Georgia, played), was a favored guest on television talk shows (usually able to \"steal the microphone\" from hosts such as Johnny Carson and Walter Cronkite), and an important role model for the nation. Jimmy Carter's mother emerges from this portrait as redoubtable, generous, and forward-looking. He ascribes to her the inspiration for his own life's work of commitment and faith.",

        "Authors": "By McIlhenny, Paul and Hunter, Barbara",
        "Description": "\"Tabasco sauce is an indispensable ingredient, and always on my kitchen counter. I am a loyal Fan.\"Pierre FraneyThe world would be a much blander place without that familiar little red bottle with the white diamond label.Ever since Edmund McIlhenny introduced his soon-to-be-famous pepper sauce in 1868, raw oysters and Bloody Marys have depended on that definitive dash to make them complete. Now, Paul McIlhenny unbottles the authoritative cookbook on this very special sauce. It's no surprise that a generous amount of Tabasco sauce adds heat and bite to foods, but The Tabasco Cookbook reveals that a judicious amount will add \"roundness\" to flavors in a multitude of ways.Tempting recipes range from contemporary offerings such as Potato, Artichoke, and Leek Soup, Devil's Chicken, and Lemon Sesame Asparagus to a host of Tabasco Classics -- regional favorites such as Eula Mae's Cajun Seafood Gumbo, Grillades for Brunch, Shrimp Creole, and Dirty Rice. Each recipe is rated from (gives flavors a lift) to (not for the meek) according to its piquancy level, and simple tips on using Tabasco sauce to heighten the flavor of everything from popcorn to polenta are sprinkled throughout the pages.The Tabasco Cookbook is filled with vignettes describing the venerable history of the pepper sauce and the family-run company behind it, as well as bits of trivia and lore revealing elusive facts, such as what a \"petit baton rouge\" is (page 130). With more than thirty-five duotone photographs from the McIlhenny archives, The Tabasco Cookbook brings to life the history behind one of America's most classic ingredients.So don't just reach for the Tabasco sauce when you're thinking \"hot\": Tabasco sauce is the perfect solution whenever flavors need a lift.",

The hushed, elegant atmosphere of a fine restaurant often conceals an intensely stressful workplace where highly trained, underpaid staffers work backbreaking hours against impossible dead-lines, often at the whim of a driven and demanding yet creatively gifted boss. New York\u2019s Restaurant Daniel is one such place. With the complete cooperation of Chef Daniel Boulud, author Leslie Brenner spent a full year at the restaurant, getting to know the staff in the kitchen, the front of the house, and the manager\u2019s office. And she reports on it all with a vivid immediacy: the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 shuffling reservations when a VIP shows up unannounced, the young pastry chef who gets passed over for a promotion (and then gets the last laugh), even the financial arrangements that keep the restaurant\u2019s doors open for business. And underlying all the daily drama is Chef Boulud\u2019s obsession with getting a fourth star from the New York Times.",

The humble tamale pie, lowly turkey hash, and ordinary ham loaf become truly memorable in his capable hands. His Texas Chili may be the best anyone has ever tasted. Mulacalong Chicken, a specialty of Charleston, South Carolina, has a soft curry flavor that's indescribably wonderful. He seasons traditional regional and ethnic dishes in unconventional and surprising ways that make a world of difference: thyme in the West Coast Oyster Stew, nutmeg in the New England Boiled Dinner, cardamom in Iowa Chicken and Corn Pot Pie, cumin in Oklahoma Fried Chicken and Biscuits, coriander in Brooklyn Borscht.Chef Paul's unique concept of \"building\" a dish to create maximum flavor and texture is used in many of his recipes, and a special section of the book explains exactly how it's done, in language anyone can understand. For example, Milwaukee Potato Soup has a base of grated potatoes for thickening and flavor, as well as two different sizes of diced potatoes for texture.Other formerly \"inelegant\" dishes are treated to the remarkable -- and frequently unorthodox-Chef Paul touch, to create food no one is likely to soon forget: A slow -- roasted, boneless stuffed chicken emerges juicy and brimming with flavor in Atchafalaya Boneless Roast Chicken. Indian fry bread topped with a spicy lamb stew and fresh salsa becomes the world's best Navajo Tacos.Through colorful stories, special tips on techniques, and invaluable information, you'll find all the encouragement you need to experiment with dishes you've always taken for granted. From Albuquerque Burritos to Lower East Side Latkes, Michigan Miner's Pasties to San Francisco Cioppino, Seasoned America and Paul Prudhomme will guide you step by step toward the successful creation of extraordinary American food.",
