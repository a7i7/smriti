The delectable creation of award-winning, number one Los Angeles Times bestselling author Jerrilyn Farmer, the irrepressible Mad Bean is back for big laughs and big trouble on the Big Island. Madeline Bean has planned phenomenal parties for Hollywood heavyweights of every ego size, but now she's cooking up something very special for one of her own -- a hip, surprise-destination bachelorette weekend at a fabulous-doesn't-do-it-justice resort in Hawaii for cherished employee and bride-to-be Holly Nichols. This hysterical riff on a luau will have everything. Tiki lamps. Hula lessons. A dead body washing in on the warm island tides. Okay, that wasn't in the original party plan.The uninvited corpse isn't the only shocker throwing a monkey wrench in the proceedings. Holly is getting cold feet about the whole engagement thing -- due, in large part, to a slight indiscretion in her past that may have left her not exactly single. Hey, what happens in Vegas is supposed to stay in Vegas, isn't it?But Madeline's not going to let a few little glitches like a mysterious preexisting husband and an island murder spoil Holly's wedding shower extravaganza -- not while there are still passion-fruit martinis to quaff and buff surfer boys to ogle. All she has to do is hunt down the first \"Mr. Holly,\" who vanished the morning after, and get him to do the right thing. That, and keep a killer who's in their midst from leaving behind any more gruesome party favors. And then there's that freaking volcano that's making annoying ready-to-erupt noises ...",

Goff has made millions in the record business, but his heart is in New Age philosophy. He has learned that Crybbe was once a spiritual center of sorts, surrounded by ancient standing stones that were emblems of power. He means to replace the stones that have fallen - or been destroyed, as many of them were - and establish a thriving New Age community that will draw tourists and students from all over the world.What Max Goff doesn't know is that the standing stones of Crybbe were destroyed in the sixteenth century for a very good reason. Some of the endearing customs of the town - such as tolling the church bell for curfew each night - are actually deadly serious rituals. The people of Crybbe know that evil has been kept at bay here by the old ways, and that there's nothing quaint about them. And the power about to be unleashed by Max Goff is nothing like the soothing music and herbal remedies he associates with the New Age. This is the power of the old age, pent up for centuries and about to be released with deadly fury!",

Her brother, Alex, probes the world beyond Maddy's island estate. And together they prove to be crime fiction's most unique and fascinating detective team: when Alex witnesses a crime, he retreats to Maddy's island where, under her powerful hypnotic trance, he retells in startling detail the horrible events.Their previous adventures have won widespread critical acclaim and numerous fans. Now, in this third very original appearance, Maddy dispatches Alex on a strange and ultimately life-threatening visit to St. Petersburg, Russia, where he encounters the mysterious hypnotist, Dr. Pavel Kamikov. The new Russia, Alex discovers, is layered with greed and lies, and Dr. Kamikov proves no different. Just how in Russia's difficult times has this man become so wealthy? Has he really made that much money from his popular TV show, Mesmerizing Moments, or is he involved in an illegal business? To muddy the scene even further, almost as soon as Alex arrives in St. Petersburg, an old friend of his is gunned down while changing dollars on the black market - an event that sweeps Alex into the new, ruthless Russia now dominated by the all-powerful Russian mafia.Filled with details of post-Soviet Russia, Red Trance charges through the dark alleys of St. Petersburg and pits Alex's life against a handful of thugs. In the very end, however, after a gruesome murder in a dark stairwell and Alex's own arrest by the Russian police, only one person is able to identify the awful truth: Maddy. Deep in hypnotic trance, the uniquely powerful and blind Maddy visualizes the scene of the crime, revealing the real course of events.",

In an era of fluff computer books that are, quite properly, remaindered within weeks of publication, this book will stand the test of time, becoming lovingly dog-eared in the hands of anyone who designs computers or has concerns about the performance of computer programs. \"   - Robert Bernecky,  Dr. Dobb's Journal , April 1998  Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach  was the first book to focus on computer architecture as a modern science. Its publication in 1990 inspired a new approach to studying and understanding computer design. Now, the second edition explores the next generation of architectures and design techniques with view to the future.  A basis for modern computer architecture  As the authors explain in their preface to the Second Edition, computer architecture itself has undergone significant change since 1990. Concentrating on currently predominant and emerging commercial systems, the Hennessy and Patterson have prepared entirely new chapters covering additional advanced topics:*  Advanced Pipelining:  A new chapter emphasizes superscalar and multiple issues.*  Networks:  A new chapter examines in depth the design issues for small and large shared-memory multiprocessors.*  Storage Systems:  Expanded presentation includes coverage of I/O performance measures.*  Memory:  Expanded coverage of caches and memory-hierarchy design addresses contemporary design issues.*  Examples and Exercises:  Completely revised on current architectures such as MIPS R4000, Intel 80x86 and Pentium, PowerPC, and HP PA-RISC.  Distinctive presentation  This book continues the style of the first edition, with revised sections on Fallacies and Pitfalls, Putting It All Together and Historical Perspective, and contains entirely new sections on Crosscutting Issues. The focus on fundamental techniques for designing real machines and the attention to maximizing cost/performance are crucial to both students and working professionals. Anyone involved in building computers, from palmtops to supercomputers, will profit from the expertise offered by Hennessy and Patterson.",

Learn everything you have to know about the size, texture, age, and taste of cigars produced in America, the Caribbean, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. 200 cigar brands are itemized, described, analyzed, and assayed; 80 of them are photographed.

        "Description": "They escaped from oppression and poverty in Russia, Poland, Germany, and many other parts of Europe, and settled mainly in America\u2019s large cities. With Jewish immigration to America came their rich family and religious traditions, and their abiding respect for the arts and sciences, inspiring many among them to great achievement in these fields. Biographical sketches include Albert Einstein, the Guggenheim family, Isaac Stern, Saul Bellow, and others.This important new series documents and dramatizes the immigration experience of untold numbers of men, women, and children who arrived in America from the four corners of the world. As they assimilated into American society, they enriched the nation\u2019s character and experience. Many of America\u2019s immigrants passed through the Ellis Island Immigration Center in New York Harbor during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. What were the initial hopes and fears of these new arrivals? Where did they first settle, and what kinds of work did they find? Which elements from their various cultures have since blended into the national scene and helped reshape what has become modern America?  The first titles in this dramatic series bring alive the experiences of four important ethnic groups, with contemporary photos and first-person accounts of their dramatic, life-changing experiences. Readers glimpse each group\u2019s social customs, family life, traditional food and drink, festivals, and much more. There are also brief but vivid capsule biographies of famous individuals who rose to prominence from each ethnic group. Approximately 150 illustrations in each book.",

        "Description": "In this account of Europe's rise to world leadership in technology, Frances and Joseph Gies make use of recent scholarship to destroy two time-honored myths. Myth One: that Europe's leap forward occurred suddenly in the \"Renaissance,\" following centuries of medieval stagnation. Not so, say the Gieses: Early modern technology and experimental science were direct outgrowths of the decisive innovations of medieval Europe, in the tools and techniques of agriculture, craft industry, metallurgy, building construction, navigation, and war. Myth Two: that Europe achieved its primacy through \"Western\" superiority. On the contrary, the authors report, many of Europe's most important inventions - the horse harness, the stirrup, the magnetic compass, cotton and silk cultivation and manufacture, papermaking, firearms, \"Arabic\" numerals - had their origins outside Europe, in China, India, and Islam. The Gieses show how Europe synthesized its own innovations - the three-field system, water power in industry, the full-rigged ship, the putting-out system - into a powerful new combination of technology, economics, and politics.From the expansion of medieval man's capabilities, the voyage of Columbus with all its fateful consequences is seen as an inevitable product, while even the genius of Leonardo da Vinci emerges from the context of earlier and lesser-known dreamers and tinkerers.Cathedral, Forge, and Waterwheel is illustrated with more than 90 photographs and drawings. It is a Split Main Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club.",

        "Description": "Master storyteller Joy Hakim has excited millions of young minds with the great drama of American history in her award-winning series A History of US. Hailed by historians, educators, and parents for its exciting, thought-provoking narrative, the books have been recognized as a break-through tool in teaching history and critical reading skills to young people. And the kids themselves agree: Hakim has piles of fan letters as testimony.        Beginning in January, PBS, in association with Thirteen/WNET, General Electric and Kunhardt Productions, will present Freedom: A History of US, an innovative television mini-series based on Joy Hakim's award-winning books. Katie Couric will host the series, George and Laura Bush will introduce the first episode, and celebrated actors such as Paul Newman, Glenn Close, Robin Williams, Matthew Broderick, Angela Bassett, Jeremy Irons, John Lithgow, and Morgan Freeman will participate as narrators. The program will focus on the history of the United States through the inspiring story of our fight to uphold the ideal of freedom, beginning with the Declaration of Independence in 1776, culminating in the Civil Rights movement, and concluding with the challenges posed by the September 11th attacks. In 8 one-hour episodes appearing nationally on public television, the story of America will unfold through Joy Hakim's vision: her belief that freedom survives again and again, despite all the mistakes and tragic setbacks, and that in order to succeed in upholding this great ideal we must examine the past.      The Freedom: A History of US companion book to the PBS series will capture both the visual energy of the programs and Hakim's rare gift for telling history through the lives of its makers. The book will follow the thread of the programs and also expand on them, providing a more complete picture of the people and events that shaped a defiant band of thirteen colonies into a great nation of 50 states. More than 400 illustrations, sidebars, and historical documents enhance this stunning look at American history for families to share, discuss, and treasure. Freedom: A History of US is an essential book for every household in America, and reminds us that great storytelling and a passion for freedom will always have a place at the table.",

        "Description": "In the world that Calvin and his tiger Hobbes share, treasures can be found in the most unlikely places, from the outer regions where Spaceman Spiff travels to the rocks in the backyard--this curious duo roams their world in search of fortunes (and misfortunes!) to be experienced. Whether Calvin and Hobbes are blasting off on another interplanetary adventure or approaching warp speed on a downhill wagon ride, their capers consistently charm and refresh their readers&#39; days. On his own, Calvin is prey to the insidious killer bicycle, is the arbiter of the Dad poll, is the creator of a legion of snowmen who provide an incisive social commentary, and Hobbes is always there as the perfect companion. Watterson&#39;s talent is evidenced by the range of thought-provoking emotions the strip encompasses in addition to the laughs it induces: the loyalty and friendship between Calvin and Hobbes, the challenge of being a patient parent, and the sardonic viewpoint of a cynical six-year-old (\"I&#39;m a 21st-century kid trapped in a 19th-century family,\" laments Calvin) combine to make this one of the best-loved strips in cartoon history.",

        "Description": "As a young Florentine envoy to the courts of France and the Italian principalities, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (1469\u20131527) was able to observe firsthand the lives of people strongly united under one powerful ruler. His fascination with that political rarity and his intense desire to see the Medici family assume a similar role in Italy provided the foundation for his \"primer for princes.\" In this classic guide to acquiring and maintaining political power, Machiavelli used a rational approach to advise prospective rulers, developing logical arguments and alternatives for a number of potential problems, among them governing hereditary monarchies, dealing with colonies and the treatment of conquered peoples. Refreshing in its directness, yet often disturbing in its cold practicality, The Prince sets down a frighteningly pragmatic formula for political fortune. Starkly relevant to the political upheavals of the 20th century, this calculating prescription for power remains today, nearly 500 years after it was written, a timely and startling lesson in the practice of autocratic rule that continues to be much read and studied by students, scholars and general readers as well.",

Ruthless mobs rule the streets of Paris, and each day, hundreds of royalists are sacrificed to the guillotine, with hundreds more condemned to follow. Their only hope lies in rescue by the Scarlet Pimpernel, the daring leader of an English faction that spirits aristocrats across the Channel to safety. This historical adventure tale first appeared in 1905, but its irresistible blend of romance, intrigue, and suspense renders it timeless. Readers thrill to the gallantry of the Pimpernel, whose nom de guerre derives from the wildflower he employs as a calling card. A scourge to the French authorities, the Pimpernel is the darling of the people \u2014 particularly Marguerite Blakeney, who scorns her foppish husband, Sir Percy, as ardently as she admires the Pimpernel. The basis of a classic film, this ever-popular story has recently been adapted as a musical, to the delight of Broadway audiences.",

The enchanting house now belongs to seventy-something Maudie Todhunter, the late Lord Todhunter's  free-spirited second wife. (The first wife, Hilda, was supposedly a  paragon of  virtue, and Maudie has always felt second-best.)  The light of Maudie's life is her vivacious stepgranddaughter, Posy, who begs Maudie to board a giant English mastiff whom Posy's mean-spirited mother has banned from the house. (The large and ungainly Polonius is an impossibly lovable canine who outshines Lassie by a mile and is destined  to become a favorite of readers worldwide.)When Maudie decides to sell Moorgate, all kinds of old family secrets come to light,  and so the saga begins.  Along the way, Rob, the contractor of Moorhouse, falls in love with a woman who has a sad secret.   Posy's father falls in love with someone kinder than his shrewish wife.  Maudie must reevaluate someone she'd fallen in love with years ago.  And as the connections intertwine between the past and the present, many unexpected alliances form.Vivid, lushly written, and entirely unforgettable, this all-absorbing novel provides the kind of abundant reading experience that will leave readers eagerly looking forward to more from this newly discovered and superbly talented author.",

        "Description": "Harvard Law School - the very name echoes with power, influence, and prestige. The oldest law school in the United States, Harvard has long been considered the paragon of American legal education.But even an institution as steeped in tradition as Harvard Law was not immune to the changing academic and social climate of the 1970s and 1980s, when multiculturalism, political correctness, and gender politics became issues of increasing significance.Change came with the arrival of three liberal professors and an attack-from-within was launched against Harvard's conservatism. Their efforts were seen by some colleagues as an attempt to subvert the \"mission\" of the school - its very essence.When Harvard Law Review editors published a vulgar parody of an article by a sensationally murdered feminist legal scholar, the turmoil at Harvard Law made national headlines. Constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe railed against the Law Review while civil libertarian Alan Dershowitz aggressively defended it. This was one of the many scandals to rock the ivy-covered walls of Harvard Law.",
