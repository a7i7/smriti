        "Description": "With his customary wit, humor, and irony, along with a fine sense of the period, Louis Auchincloss artfully brings to life an exciting and dramatic facet of eighteenth-century England. On the Continent, John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, is laying waste to the lowlands in a bloody combat with Louis XIV At the British court, Queen Anne, aging, ill, and surrounded by sycophants, is coping with the intrigues of those who wish to promote Marlborough's dangerous ambitions. Chief among the plotters is his headstrong wife (and court favorite), Sarah Churchill.Into this tense and steamy environment comes young Abigail Hill, Sarah's impoverished cousin. Sarah has arranged for her to be a maid to the Queen. But Abigail will discover that she has been marked by destiny for a special mission, which is nothing less than to bring to a halt a bloody and destructive world war. How she accomplishes this is the subject of this unusual but historically justified tale.The drama of court life and high politics, the growing antagonism between Sarah and Abigail, and an engaging cast of characters make for a lively narrative. And the portrait of Queen Anne is a tour de force that lends further depth to this vivid and engaging book.",

        "Title": "The NFL Experience: Twelve Months with America's Favorite Game",
        "Authors": "By Barber, Phil",
        "Description": "All eyes turn to pro football on Super Bowl Sunday. More than 130 million viewers nationwide -- nearly 800 million around the world -- position themselves in front of television screens to watch the biggest single-day event in sports. Every pass, every run, and every tackle of the National Football League's championship game are captured by the camera's lens. Every statistical nuance is reported and dissected by the hundreds of media representatives assigned to cover the event. Far less understood is what transpires throughout the rest of the year to set the stage for the NFL's annual spectacle. The NFL Experience takes you behind the scenes and into the inner sanctum of pro football from start to finish. Join veteran players and hopeful rookies toiling privately as they sweat their bodies into shape, and get an up-close look at exhausting, two-a-day practices as they compete for jobs in remote training camps. Ride a roller coaster of emotional ups and downs during the 16-game NFL schedule. And feel the adrenaline rushes and bone-jarring collisions that define the do-or-die postseason. The NFL Experience, through words and pictures, captures the disparate elements, fascinating characters, and contrasting emotions that emerge as the NFL calendar unwinds and builds to a crescendo each season. This is a rare chance to observe the endless monotony of midsummer drills and the hair-raising excitement of game day, to relish in the joy of victory and understand the dejection that accompanies defeat. You will see many of the same sights a player witnesses on the field, and be afforded an insight into the mind set that is required to play the game. Among the lessons shared are the words of former quarterback Boomer Esiason, who describes the role of the quarterback in the face of a fierce pass rush: \"He's gotta hold the ball for a fraction longer, and when he throws it, he's gonna get hit underneath the chin. What the coaches are looking for is that guy who's going to stand in there and throw the ball accurately in the face of fire.\" The NFL Experience is a unique insider's look at the faces of the men who play America's favorite sport -- and a rare view of the long, winding path they travel to arrive at pro football's defining moment.",

With feline equanimity, he tells how he was saved from a racing, swollen river; of how he lost the most unlikely and dearest friend he had; and of how he gained a cat family of his own. And he regales us with news of the ghost cats who visit him in his dreams - the cats of Cleopatra and Freud among them - bringing him their ancient cat wisdom, which Foudini tries, none too successfully at first, to impart to Grace, the sleek and beautiful gray country cat new to the household.

        "Description": "With tremendous power at their fingertips, CEOs also have tremendous pressures and overwhelming responsibilities. How do these mere mortals deal with the heady combination of worship and resentment? How do they juggle the apparent freedom to do anything and the burden they constantly bear: that the careers, investments, and incomes of thousands of people depend upon their wisdom? This is the CEO paradox.The CEO Paradox is an insightful, moving, and highly personal look at how to wrestle with the rigors of authority. Thomas R. Horton writes with eloquence, wit, and the wisdom that comes from over three decades in leadership positions. He distills his own experiences and his observations of CEOs in other organizations into a sampler of sensible advice on how to deftly manage both the demands and temptations of leadership.The author speaks his mind - both as a critic of the bad calls and weaknesses of well-known leaders and as admirer of the strategic vision of others. His insights provide CEOs, leaders, and would-be leaders with valuable lessons that range from the dangers of ambition and greed to advice on planning, budgeting, and decision making to fashion notes for CEOs and warnings to control \"those twittering hormones.\" He also shares practical ideas for how readers can nurture the highest qualities within themselves, bring out the best in their employees, and cultivate both the \"inner\" and the \"outer\" person.In the end, what makes a successful CEO? According to Horton, \"World-class executives, like world-class products, earn their reputation by their quality.\" The CEO Paradox shows leaders at all levels how to bypass the shallow seductions of power and find the quality in themselves and all who surround them.",

For the more than sixty-five million Americans affected by some form of cardiovascular disease and the millions of others concerned about their risk of heart disease, the Yale University School of Medicine Heart Book could well be a lifesaver, with indispensable information on the prevention, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of our number one killer disease.Each of the twenty-nine chapters was written by a member of Yale's distinguished medical school faculty and staff. In clear, understandable language they provide answers such as how to recognize critical warning signs (and take preventive action) before a heart attack strikes, how to live a normal life after a heart attack, how to modify your diet to lower cholesterol and lose weight without destroying the pleasure of eating, and how to manage stress in today's anxiety-ridden world.There are special sections on tests and procedures as well as chapters on heart disease in women, the elderly, and children and young adults. A quick reference \"Encyclopedia of Common Heart Disorders\" provides at-a-glance descriptions of each medical problem, as well as its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.Also featured is a full-color atlas of the cardiovascular system and more than two hundred illustrations, charts, and tables. The Yale University School of Medicine Heart Book is truly the one reference guide every family needs to be fully informed about maintaining a healthy heart.",

He was a defeated politician who somehow was made governor. You can hardly blame him for expecting to inherit the White House.  \"Is Our Children Learning?\" examines the public life and public record of George W. Bush and reveals him for who he is: a man who presents the thinnest, weakest, least impressive record in public life of any major party nominee this century; a man who at every critical juncture has been propelled upward by the forces of wealth, privilege, status, and special interests who use his family's name for their private gain.  A Texan, political analyst, strategist, and partisan, Paul Begala has written a devastating assessment of the Bush brand of politics.",

        "Authors": "By Dunning, John",
        "Description": "Widely acclaimed for his groundbreaking crime novels Booked to Die and The Bookman's Wake, award-winning author John Dunning triumphantly returns with a riveting new thriller that takes us back to the summer of 1942, when radio was in its prime, when daylight saving time gave way to \"wartime,\" when stations like WHAR on the New Jersey coast struggled to create programming that entertained and inspired a nation in its dark hour. Into this intense community of radio artists and technicians in Regina Beach, New Jersey, come Jack Dulaney and Holly Carnahan. They are determined to find Holly's missing father, whose last desperate word came from this noisy seaside town. Holly sings like an angel and has what it takes to become a star. Jack -- a racetrack hot-walker and novelist who's hit every kind of trouble in his travels from sea to sea -- tries out as a writer at WHAR and soon discovers a passion for radio and a natural talent for script writing. While absorbing the ways of radio, from writing to directing, he meets some extraordinarily brave and gifted people who touch his life in ways he could not have imagined -- actresses Rue, Pauline, and Hazel; actor-director Waldo, creator of the magnificent black show Freedom Road; and enigmatic station owner Loren Harford, among others.  Jack's zeal for radio is exceeded only by his devotion to Holly, who needs his help but who is terrified for his safety. Strange things are happening in Regina Beach, starting with an English actor who walked out of the station six years ago and was never seen again. And Holly's father is gone too, in equally puzzling circumstances. As Jack and Holly penetrate deeper into the shadows of the past, they learn that someone will do anything, including murder, to hide some devastating truths.  In a stunning novel that transcends genre, John Dunning calls upon his vast knowledge of radio and his incisive reading of history to create a poignant, page-turning work of fiction that sheds new insights on some of the most harrowing events of the twentieth century. Like E. L. Doctorow's Billy Bathgate or Caleb Carr's The Alienist, Dunning's brilliant tale of mystery, murder, and revenge brings to life another time, another place, another world.",

        "Description": "A stunning follow-up to her bestselling debut,Mrs. Kimble, Jennifer Haigh returns withBaker Towers, a compelling story of love and lossin a western Pennsylvania mining town inthe years after World War IIBakerton is a company town built on coal, a town of church festivals and ethnic neighborhoods, hunters' breakfasts and firemen's parades. Its children are raised in company houses -- three rooms upstairs, three rooms downstairs. Its ball club leads the coal company league. The twelve Baker mines offer good union jobs, and the looming black piles of mine dirt don't bother anyone. Called Baker Towers, they are local landmarks, clear evidence that the mines are booming. Baker Towers mean good wages and meat on the table, two weeks' paid vacation and presents under the Christmas tree.The mines were not named for Bakerton; Bakerton was named for the mines. This is an important distinction. It explains the order of things.Born and raised on Bakerton's Polish Hill, the five Novak children come of age during wartime, a thrilling era when the world seems on the verge of changing forever. The oldest, Georgie, serves on a minesweeper in the South Pacific and glimpses life beyond Bakerton, a promising future he is determined to secure at all costs. His sister Dorothy, a fragile beauty, takes a job in Washington, D.C., and finds she is unprepared for city life. Brilliant Joyce longs to devote herself to something of consequence but instead becomes the family's keystone, bitterly aware of the opportunities she might have had elsewhere. Sandy sails through life on looks and charm, and Lucy, the volatile baby, devours the family's attention and develops a bottomless appetite for love.Baker Towers is a family saga and a love story, a hymn to a time and place long gone, to America's industrial past and the men and women we now call the Greatest Generation. This is a feat of imagination from an extraordinary new voice in American fiction, a writer of enormous power and skill.",

        "Description": "In the wake of 9/11 no one knew when the next attack would come, or where it would come from. America's enemies seemed gathered on all sides, and for several nerve-racking months, we lived in fear that the perpetrators might be plotting another action or, worse, that our most dangerous enemies -- al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's murderous regime in Iraq -- could be banding together against us.The Bush administration and CIA director George Tenet warned against complacency and pointed to growing indications that al Qaeda and Iraq were in league. But their case was undercut by unnamed intelligence officials, skeptical politicians, and a compliant media. So America relaxed. A comforting consensus settled in: Osama bin Laden was an impassioned fundamentalist, Saddam a secular autocrat. The two would never, could never, work together. ABC News reported that there was no connection between them, and the New York Times said so too, and pretty soon just about everyone agreed.Just about everyone was wrong.In The Connection, Stephen Hayes draws on CIA debriefings, top-secret memos from our national intelligence agencies, and interviews with Iraqi military leaders and Washington insiders to demonstrate that Saddam and bin Laden not only could work together, they did -- a curious relationship that stretches back more than a decade and may include collaboration on terrorist acts, chemical-weapons training, and sheltering some of the world's most wanted radicals.Stephen Hayes's bombshell Weekly Standard piece on this topic was cited by Vice President Cheney as the \"best source of information\" about the Saddam-al Qaeda connections. Now Hayes delves even deeper, exposing the inner workings of America's deadliest opponents and providing a clear-eyed corrective to reams of underreported, politicized, and just plain wrong information.The Connection is both a gripping snapshot of the War on Terror and a case study in how bureaucratic assumptions and media arrogance can put us all at risk.",

News is crackling all around him when Jack Flynn, ace reporter for The Boston Record, is summoned to a secret meeting with his esteemed publisher, Paul Ellis. Ellis sadly reveals that the newspaper they both love, owned by his family for more than a century, is the target of a hostile takeover bid by a shadowy corporate chain. Desperate, he asks for Jack's help.  Already on the brink of a hot political scoop, Jack sets out in pursuit of a hidden truth. But that very day his life is threatened. The Record is beset by horrific tragedy. And a death from years ago no longer appears what it once seemed.  Now Jack is forced to question not only the words published in his own paper but the relationships that have been the bedrock of his life -- in particular those with his gorgeous ex-girlfriend, who writes for a rival tabloid, and with the venerable Record reporter Robert Fitzgerald, Jack's longtime mentor.  And all along, Jack is sitting on a goldmine of information that could torpedo the president's controversial nomination of the Massachusetts governor to be the next U.S. Attorney General. As he balances on a tightrope of personal and professional peril, shuttling from the swamps of central Florida to the corridors of Congress, then back to the alleyways of Boston, Jack is left with just two questions: Will his newspaper survive long enough for him to tell his story? Will he?  Combining breakneck speed and tension-packed plotting with the insights of a consummate political insider, Brian McGrory explores the ethics and direction of modern journalism and analyzes how, in this era of media saturation, reputations are made and too often destroyed. The Nominee, peopled with irresistible characters that linger long after the last page is turned, confirms his position at the forefront of today's most talented young suspense writers.",

Once he gets there, what he finds is worse than his most hellish imaginings: a young woman, beaten and burned almost beyond recognition, a trauma case as terrible as any he has ever seen. What Jackson's colleagues don't know is that the victim, Allie, is actually his lover.  With Allie in a coma, Jackson keeps their relationship quiet and takes part in her reconstruction, a complicated and grueling set of procedures that only the most skilled specialists can perform. But as he and the other doctors struggle to put her back together, the fractures in Jackson's own life begin to break apart dramatically. When the San Francisco Police Department's investigation of the attack leads to his door, Jackson knows the truth can no longer be suppressed.  Ghost Image is an expertly plotted, chillingly vivid, and wholly absorbing mystery, signaling the debut of an unforgettable new voice in the genre. Taking readers inside the operating room and literally under the skin of its patients, it's a story that will appeal to those fascinated by medicine and forensics. It is also a story -- like all classic crime novels -- about guilt and innocence, good and evil. But, above all, it is a story of love -- the kind of love that might prove deadly, or that might just save your soul.",

        "Title": "The Future in Plain Sight : Nine Clues to the Coming Instability",
        "Authors": "By Linden, Eugene",
        "Description": "Economic collapse, deadly famine, political upheaval, catastrophic storms, religious fanaticism, lethal plagues, overcrowded cities -- is this what the future holds? The keys to our future, says author and Time magazine contributor Eugene Linden, are hidden in plain sight, obscured by the glare of the present and the tyranny of the recent past. Writes Linden: \"We will know much if we can answer one question: Will life in the next century be less stable than it is now?\"  Humans have prospered during the extraordinary stability of recent decades, but our very success carries with it the seeds of future upheaval. If we look carefully, we can see harbingers of the coming turmoil. But what can we do about it?  It is particularly difficult to imagine a return to instability today, since baby boomers have had the privilege of growing up in one of the most stable periods in the vast sweep of human history. More than fifty years have passed without catastrophic conflict between great powers; more than sixty years have passed since the end of the last great economic depression. This hiatus falls within a period of 150 years of good weather that is just beginning to change. Since our distant ancestors last saw real instability, more than 8,000 years ago, humans have invented agriculture, writing, cities, and commerce; we have flown to the moon and have multiplied from a few million souls to roughly 5.6 billion.  We have come to view stability as the norm, but it is not. For the first 95 percent of humanity's time on the planet, our ancestors regularly had to cope with rapid change brought about by abrupt climate shifts and their impact on the landscape and food supply. Even in the brief snippet of time that constitutes recorded human history, civilizations have collapsed repeatedly because of droughts and plagues, and with the invasions of armies and ideas.  What would it mean if instability returned?  The Future in Plain Sight lays out nine clues to the answer. These include: the persistently widening gap between the rich and poor; the resurgence of infectious disease; the effects of a changing global climate on businesses and human attitudes; and the currency crises in Mexico and Asia. In each of the nine clues, Linden focuses on an overlooked aspect of familiar events. He looks past the immediate upheavals caused by the Mexican and Asian currency crises, for instance, to see an inherent volatility in the global market that these crises exposed. The book shows how each clue is symptomatic of ever-increasing instability in fundamental aspects of modern life, ranging from the world's financial markets to the natural systems that support our well-being.  How will we live in the year 2050? How can we plan for life in an unsettled and unsettling universe? Linden explores the frightening prospect of this world through a series of scenarios that dramatize the forces that will prevail in the coming decades. From London and New York to central Africa and Antarctica, these scenarios portray life in the unstable world of 2050.",

Based on sources within the firms themselves, interviews with key clients, and access to now-sealed court records, the book provides the inside story that consultants would prefer you not know. James O'Shea and Charles Madigan tell you about conspiracies at the top, boneheaded assumptions, as well as brilliant performances. While Dangerous Company reveals the underside of consulting, it also looks at many success stories: how a consulting firm helped a pharmaceutical company develop a strategy for marketing instruments that enable diabetics to manage their disease. Not only has the product been profitable, it has greatly improved that lives of millions of people; how Sears got turned around. Arthur Martinez's sophisticated and limited use of consultants is a model for how companies should work with consultants in the future; and how small, highly focused consulting firms are providing cost-effective, targeted advice to companies and mounting a significant challenge to the big consulting powerhouses.Tough, fair, and thoroughly researched, Dangerous Company is for anyone who wants to understand how the world of business really works. It will also force a rethinking by management about the implications of a decision to bring in consultants. Nothing less than the jobs of thousands of employees, millions of dollars of shareholder investment, and long-term relationships with customers are at stake.",
