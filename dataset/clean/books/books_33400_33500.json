An lively overview of Obama\u2019s life, this timely book begins with his difficult childhood as the son of a Kansas-born college student and a black Kenyan who abandoned the family, moving through his election to president of the Harvard Law Review (the first black student ever), his early political career (including his loss of a congressional race in 2000), his own family life with wife Michelle and two daughters, his 2004 election to U.S. Senator, and his emergence as a symbol of hope for America. Including his own words and comments from both his critics and supporters, Hopes and Dreams is essential reading for all those interested in the man who is being talked about as a candidate for our highest office. No political figure in recent memory has generated the interest that Obama has, and many compare his appeal to that of a rock star. Only forty-five years old, Barack Obama is certain to play an important role in America\u2019s future. Here is his inspiring story to date, in words and revealing images.",

But wreaking havoc can incur expenses, so the twins come up with a unique fund-raising scheme: They'll nab the pets of Nod's Limbs and transform them into exotic animals they can sell for big bucks.

        "Authors": "By Le Carre, John",
        "Description": "Frightening, heartbreaking, and exquisitely calibrated, John le Carr\u00e9's new novel opens with the gruesome murder of the young and beautiful Tessa Quayle near northern Kenya's Lake Turkana, the birthplace of mankind. Her putative African lover and traveling companion, a doctor with one of the aid agencies, has vanished from the scene of the crime. Tessa's much older husband, Justin, a career diplomat at the British High Commission in Nairobi, sets out on a personal odyssey in pursuit of the killers and their motive.  A master chronicler of the deceptions and betrayals of ordinary people caught in political conflict, le Carr\u00e9 portrays, in The Constant Gardener, the dark side of unbridled capitalism. His eighteenth novel is also the profoundly moving story of a man whom tragedy elevates. Justin Quayle, amateur gardener and ineffectual bureaucrat, seemingly oblivious to his wife's cause, discovers his own resources and the extraordinary courage of the woman he barely had time to love. The Constant Gardener is a magnificent exploration of the new world order by one of the most compelling and elegant storytellers of our time.",

The melancholic, middle-aged lexicographer plunges into an increasingly ambiguous relationship with the vivacious Mrs. Thrale for the next twenty years. In that time Hester's eldest daughter, the neglected but prodigiously clever Queeney, will grow into young womanhood. Along the way, little of the emotional tangle and sexual tension stirring beneath the decorous surfaces of the Thrale household will escape Queeney's cold, observant eye. \"A dark, often hilarious and deeply human vision ... a major literary accomplishment.\"\u2014Margaret Atwood, Toronto Globe and Mail \"....at the end of this luminous little novel ... we feel two losses ... the personal one and the loss to civilization.\"\u2014Richard Bernstein, New York Times \"Dialogue and descriptions subtly and skillfully convey a sense not only of the period but also the personalities.\"\u2014Merle Rubin, Los Angeles Times \"[Bainbridge's] most accomplished novel so far.\"\u2014Washington Post Book World \"Majestically deft....

McManus, the \u201cfunniest guy in the Outdoor Life and Field & Stream gang\u2026offers another bag of whimsy in the Great Outdoors\u201d* with The Grasshopper Trap.

        "Description": "A close-up on one of American history's most magical events, JFK's inaugural week, and the creation of the speech that inspired a generation and brought hope to a nation\"Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\" On the January morning when John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency and stood to speak those words, America was divided, its citizens torn by fears of war. Kennedy's speech-called the finest since Lincoln at Gettysburg and the most memorable of any twentieth-century American politician-did more than reassure: it changed lives, marking the start of a brief, optimistic era of struggle against \"tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\" Ask Not is a beautifully detailed account of the week leading up to the inaugural which stands as one of the most moving spectacles in the history of American politics. At the heart of the narrative is Kennedy's quest to create a speech that would distill American dreams and empower a new generation. Thurston Clarke's portrait of JFK during what intimates called his happiest days is balanced, revealing the President at his most dazzlingly charismatic-and cunningly pragmatic. As the snow covers Washington in a blanket of white, as statesmen and celebrities arrive for candlelit festivities, the perfectionist Kennedy pushes himself to the limit, to find the words that would capture what he most truly believed and which would far outlast his own life. For everyone who seeks to understand the fascination with all things Kennedy, the answer can be found in Ask Not.",

        "Authors": "By Cristol, J. (NA)",
        "Description": "On June 8, 1967, at the height of the Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Israeli air and naval forces attacked the USS LIBERTY, an intelligence-collection ship in the service of Israel&#39;s closest ally, while that vessel steamed in international waters off the Sinai Peninsula. The Israelis killed 34 Americans, wounded 171, and nearly sank the ship. Dozens of theories exist about what happened that day. Official inquiries conducted in both the United States and Israel attributed the event to faulty communications and tragic error, but survivors remain outspoken and not alone in their belief that the Israelis acted deliberately. Federal judge and former naval aviator A. Jay Cristol places the incident in its proper context. The Israeli strike, he argues, can only be understood in light of the Cold War, the outbreak of war in the Middle East, interservice rivalry within the Israeli Defense Forces, and the chaos of an operational environment. That both the United States and Israel kept much of the data concerning the incident classified for more than ten years served only to fuel the fires of intrigue and charges of conspiracy to cover up the truth, but since the incident significant portions of most of the official inquiries have now been declassified. Cristol draws on these, on documents recently obtained by him through the Freedom of Information Act, and on extensive oral history interviews to deliver the most comprehensive treatment of the episode that threatened to ruin Israel&#39;s relations with the United States and has served as a nagging source of suspicion for so many years.",

Gerbils also enjoy being gently held by their owners. Books in this series are written especially for inexperienced pet owners, for parents whose kids would like to have a pet, and for kids who simply want to learn more about animals that make good pets. Boys and girls are also introduced to the golden rules of pet care, and are advised on how to create affection and trust between themselves and their pets. Several gatefold pages in each book open wide to display attractive photo essays on animals and their care. Every book in this series contains approximately 80 full-color, high-quality photos, as well as instructive drawings.",
