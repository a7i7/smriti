In the 17th century, a young Italian scholar sailing from Venice to Naples is taken prisoner and delivered to Constantinople. There he falls into the custody of a scholar known as Hoja--\"master\"--a man who is his exact double. In the years that follow, the slave instructs his master in Western science and technology, from medicine to pyrotechnics. But Hoja wants to know more: why he and his captive are the persons they are and whether, given knowledge of each other's most intimate secrets, they could actually exchange identities. Set in a world of magnificent scholarship and terrifying savagery, The White Castle is a colorful and intricately patterned triumph of the imagination.

The best book yet by America's finest sportswriter.\" -- Pete Hamill  \"Here is what makes Mike Lupica so good\u2014he is a gifted writer with the skills of a first-rate reporter and the honest sentiment of a lifelong fan. Here is what makes this book so good\u2014baseball's summer of '98 provided authentic moments of poetry and passion, the kind of stuff that shines through all the crassness and nonsense, to remind us all why we can still care. I'd say the storyteller is a damn good match for the story.\" -- Bob Costas, NBC Sports  \"This isn't just one of the best books you'll ever read about baseball. It's one of the best books you'll ever read about fathers and sons. And one more thing: in this one, I said everything Mike said I said.\" -- Yoggi Berra  \"No one writes about baseball's glorious sporting scene better than Mike Lupica, and this was one of the greatest glory years of all.\" -- Tom Brokaw, NBC News  From one of sportswriting's best-known commentators comes a funny, moving, and unconventional exploration of a glorious baseball season.   In the summer of '61, Mike Lupica's father left notes for him in the night: Maris hit another, Mantle went two-for-four, the Yanks won. That was Lupica's best summer ever. He thought he'd never have another like it\u2014until the summer of '98, when he found himself leaving notes for his own sons: Sosa hit another, McGwire hit one back. And the Yanks won.   With humor and feeling, Lupica recaptures the season that made everyone stand up and cheer, but not in any ordinary way. His is also a story of fathers and sons\u2014about the golden thread that stretches through baseball and, for Lupica, from his father to himself to his sons. \"I cannot tell you why baseball is passed on the way it is, more than the other sports. I just know it came first with me. It was something I shared with my father, and still share today. It was a special language we had, at the ballpark, in the front seat of a '56 Dodge, watching on television. Talking on the telephone the night McGwire hit No. 62, all that time after we had watched Maris hit No. 61. A love that fits inside a bigger love, like a ball in a mitt.\"",

        "Title": "In Secret Service: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Silver, Mitch",
        "Description": "In this debut of a uniquely talented novelist, Ian Fleming's real world of spies, love, passion, and danger is brought to life when a young woman inherits Fleming's long-hidden account of spying during World War II and must finish it to find out why people are trying to kill her.In 1964, James Bond's creator sealed a package containing a manuscript he thought no one would read until fifty years after his death. Ian Fleming was an officer in Britain's Naval Intelligence during World War II, and he had his own adventures to recount. His family ties and his career had taken him to the upper echelons of British and American society and espionage, a world where passionate affairs, exotic locations, and polite cocktail chatter were interlaced with danger, betrayal, and deceit. He'd replicated that world in his famous novels, but this manuscript contained a real spy story that would explode history when its secrets were revealed. He'd chosen the reader, and he'd have to trust she would serve the truth.In 2005, Amy Greenberg -- a young American academic with a glittering future -- is summoned to Ireland to claim the contents of her grandfather's safe deposit box, in which she finds only one thing: a manuscript by Ian Fleming. The pages detail Fleming's involvement in Allied spycraft and contain information so confidential, so potentially explosive, that Amy soon discovers that people on both sides of the Atlantic are willing to kill to maintain its secrecy. As she journeys back home with her precious cargo, Amy finds herself in a race against time -- she must unlock the manuscript's shocking and fascinating secrets and outwit the unknown assailants who would do anything to bury the truth and protect a traitor's name.Peopled with characters including Winston Churchill, Princess Diana, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Anthony Blunt, and FDR and illustrated with authenticating documents, In Secret Service is a historical mystery inside a contemporary thriller. The debut of an exciting new writer, this book combines impeccable research with thrilling action, in a brand-new take on espionage suspense.",

        "Description": "Scientists have recently begun to question one of the pillars of modern thought--Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Certainly evolution occurs; but if it is a slow, continuous process by which one species gradually modifies itself into a new one, as Darwin believed, why are there so many missing links in the fossil records? Two eminent scientists, Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould, startled the world by challenging Darwin's cherished beliefs proposing instead that once a species has evolved it rarely undergoes change, and that the evolution of new species occurs only periodically, in relatively rapid spurts. In Time Frames Niles Eldredge explains how his own work with trilobite fossils led him to this unexpected conclusion, and describes the fascinating development of the new theory of punctuated equilibria.Originally published in 1989.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.",

In these  vivid settings L\u2019Amour takes us into the pivotal moments when lives are altered forever,  when men and women face a deadly enemy, find a kindred spirit, or confront their  own mortality.  Among the unforgettable characters we meet here are a hard-living,  hard-drinking freighter captain whose penchant for flying may change the course of  World War II . . . A lonely frontiersman who unexpectedly finds himself the protector  of two orphans . . . A boxer who accepts a gambler\u2019s payoff and then must fight to  redeem himself . . . A detective willing to believe an unproven story in order to  discover a painful truth hidden in a small town. And in the title story L\u2019Amour weaves  the powerful tale of a young Tibetan khan who leads a band of horsemen on a daring  escape across treacherous mountain terrain. At stake is the survival of a people  and an ancient way of life.  Evoking the American spirit of bravery, pride, adventure,  and self-reliance as few writers have, this extraordinary volume proves once again  that L\u2019Amour has set a standard yet to be matched.",

These changes have marked an evolution in what I want from this life. I am what I want. What I seek to consume, possess, and achieve is a mirror that reflects my lusts and cravings, values and priorities, and moral boundaries or lack thereof. I am happy to say that what I want today is much less toxic and self-centered than what I used to want. It's taken decades of selfexamination to peel back the layers and figure out what really makes me happy. And while I'm still searching for my ultimate bliss, I know for sure it's not what I once thought it was. It's not alcohol, cigarettes, money, food, sugar, or status symbols: I've consumed all of those in massive quantities, and they've just made me miserable. Now, I want what can't be tasted, smoked, worn, seen, or counted. It's the opposite of material. As sappy as it might sound, what I want is spiritual.'\u2014From the IntroductionIn iWant, Jane Velez-Mitchell shares her candid and engaging story of the true adventure of her life, a journey of self-discovery that is still in full throttle. As she searches for the ultimate joy and freedom that come from living a compassionate life, she challenges all of us to learn from her examples to end destructive behaviors and embrace a meaningful existence alongside one another.",

        "Description": "The Boston Arts Academy comprises an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse student body, yet 94 percent of its graduates are accepted to college. Compare this with the average urban district rate of 50 percent. How do they do it? This remarkable success, writes Principal Linda Nathan, is in large part due to asking the right questions\u2014questions all schools can consider, such as:\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How and why does a school develop a shared vision of what it stands for? \u2022\u00a0What makes a great teacher, and how can a principal help good teachers improve?\u2022\u00a0Why must schools talk openly about race and achievement, and what happens when they do?\u00a0With engaging honesty, Nathan gives readers a ring-side seat as faculty, parents, and the students themselves grapple with these questions, attempt to implement solutions, and evaluate the outcomes. Stories that are inspirational as well as heartbreaking reveal the missteps and failures\u2014as well as the successes. \u00a0Nathan doesn\u2019t claim to have all the answers, but seeks to share her insights on schools that matter, teachers who inspire, and students who achieve.",
