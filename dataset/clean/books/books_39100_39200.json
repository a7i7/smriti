This is a strategem for disaster, Herbert Scoville argues. \"The scale of the MX deployment program almost defies comprehension. It can only be described by using the superlative case\u2014the most expensive, the most everything, except effective. In this book Scoville, President of the Arms Control Association and formerly a senior official in the Central Intelligence Agency, reveals the MX to be an unnecessary and extraordinarily expensive project that will not fufill its original intent. He points out that land-based missiles will still be vulnerable to attack and may actually increase the risk of such an attack, since the MX will lead to a new and accelerated arms race. Scoville presents the history of the MX system from the Carter to Reagan administrations. He describes security implications and the future of nuclear arms control; the cost in dollars, resources, and local social and environmental impact; and alternatives to the MX system through arms limitation or sea-basing.",

Now, in Dragon Fire, he takes us with him into the top-secret rooms where the fate of the world is held in the hearts and minds of men with dangerous and hidden agendas. Packed with action and espionage, intrigue and romance, Dragon Fire is a riveting, intricate, ripped-from-the-headlines thriller that so convincingly written, readers will wonder just how much of it is true.Upon the assassination of the Secretary of Defense, former senator and Vietnam POW, Michael Patrick Santini, is called upon by his President to fill the vacancy. Once there, he discovers that the United States is under attack by a silent, sinister force, someone determined to alienate our allies and undermine our position as a global superpower. But America is hours away from going to war\u2014with the wrong enemy. Rejecting direct orders from the president, Santini races across the world in a desperate attempt to prevent a catastrophic global war. When Democratic President Bill Clinton chose Republican William S. Cohen to join his staff in 1997 as the 20th Secretary of Defense, it was the first time in modern U.S. history that a president selected a member of the opposing party for his cabinet. Cohen, the first Secretary of Defense to make biological warfare and terrorism almost a personal crusade, was integral in orchestrating a comprehensive strategy to deal with the threat of terrorism. In Dragon Fire, he takes his experience, knowledge, expertise, passion, and fears and melds fact and fiction into a political thriller only he could write.",

Year after year, celebrants come from near and far to show off their best clothes, cook up special dishes, and pay tribute to the rich heritage of the former slaves who settled the Illinois town, hoping to piece together a life. But along with stories of the good times come unbearably painful memories and long-buried resentments.Narrated by a chorus of voices, An Eighth of August begins with the Sunday church services of the 1986 celebration, a year after a terrible tragedy rocked the people of this close-knit community. The festival provides the backdrop for a vividly moving story that weaves together the lives and voices of the residents of Halley's Landing. We hear form strong-willed Flossie Jo Penticott and her estranged daughter, Sweet Alma, whose relationship has been torn apart by an unimaginable sorrow; Flossie's scatterbrained sister-in-law Thelma and her salt-of-the-earth husband, Herbert, who remain steadfastly devoted despite life's ups and downs; Aunt Cora, whose humor, generous spirit, and large home provide refuge for the weary; and May Ruth, an eccentric older white women who fits in like any other family member.",

        "Description": "Prizewinning journalists John Harwood and Gerald F. Seib show how today\u2019s Washington power game really works, through stories of people who are making a difference on Pennsylvania Avenue, America\u2019s power street. These new power brokers, some of whom are rarely seen and are largley unknown, have figured out how to make their voices heard, and how to get things done, amid the complexities of today\u2019s gridlocked Washington. With unprecedented access to Washington insiders, and with deep insight into the unspoken rules of the road in the capital, Harwood and Seib explain why progress is so difficult and illuminate what it takes to succeed in the high stakes game of politics.Pennsylvania Avenue, the 1.2-mile stretch between the White House and the Capitol, is where the influential and ambitious congregate. Through stories of party strategists, money men, policy-makers, fixers, socialites, lobbyists, spinners, deal-makers, and more, Harwood and Seib explore the great political transformations that have altered in a fundamental way the relationship between Americans and their government. A new class of politician and radically different ways of conducting business now exist in Washington. Harwood and Seib showcase such master players as Ken Duberstein (the Fixer), a onetime aide to President Ronald Reagan turned superlobbyist, whose contacts and insider knowledge help clients sidestep Avenue jam-ups; Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein (the Businessman), a new breed of power broker who pioneered the age of \u201cbig money\u201d in Washington; Rahm Emanuel(the Democratic Strategist), whose aggressive fundraising and crisis-room campaign enabled the Democrats to retake Congress in 2006; Debbie Wasserman Schultz (the Rising Star), a first-term Democratic representative from Florida whose meteoric ascent in the House has earned her influential allies as well as critics; Hilary Rosen (the Advocate), a former entertainment industry lobbyist who skillfully reframed the debate about same-sex marriage; and more.Inspiring and wonderfully written, Pennsylvania Avenue takes us inside America\u2019s center of influence to show how our government really functions, and the insiders who make things happen.\"Through a series of sharp vignettes and character sketches, the authors of \"Pennsylvania Avenue,\" John Harwood and Gerald F. Seib, take the reader behind some of the more imposing facades along the refurbished road, introducing the famous and not-so-famous, and explaining how business gets done in the new Washington. Though they accept the common view that the old rules have changed, their analysis is fresh and stimulating.\"--The New York Times",

Instead, he endorses concentrating on building long-term customer loyalty to the point where customers bring in business by recommending the company to potential customers. He describes the Net Promoter Score (NPS), a metric firms can use to gauge their success in customer satisfaction against that of their competitors.

        "Authors": "By Persico, Joseph E.",
        "Description": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt was arguably the greatest figure of the twentieth century. While FDR\u2019s official circle was predominantly male, it was his relationships with women\u2013particularly with Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd\u2013that most vividly bring to light the human being beneath this towering statesman. It is no coincidence that Rutherfurd was with Roosevelt the day he died in Warm Springs, Georgia, along with two other close women companions. In Franklin and Lucy, acclaimed author and historian Joseph E. Persico explores FDR\u2019s romance with Lucy Rutherfurd, which was far deeper and lasted much longer than was previously acknowledged. Persico\u2019s provocative conclusions about their relationship are informed by a revealing range of sources, including never-before-published letters and documents from Lucy Rutherfurd\u2019s estate that attest to the intensity and scope of the affair.FDR\u2019s connection with Lucy also creates an opportunity for Persico to take a more penetrating look at the other women in FDR\u2019s life. We come to see more clearly how FDR\u2019s infidelity as a husband contributed to Eleanor\u2019s eventual transformation from a repressed Victorian to perhaps the greatest American woman of her century; how the shaping hand of FDR\u2019s strong-willed mother helped to imbue him with the resolve to overcome personal and public adversity throughout his life; and how other women around FDR, including his \u201csurrogate spouse,\u201d Missy LeHand, and his close confidante, the obscure Margaret \u201cDaisy\u201d Suckley, completed the world that he inhabited. Franklin and Lucy is an extraordinary look at the private life of a leader who continues to fascinate scholars and the general public alike. In focusing on Lucy Rutherfurd and the myriad women who mattered to Roosevelt, Persico paints a more intimate portrait than we have heretofore had of this enigmatic giant of American history.",

        "Title": "Kit's Law: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Morrissey, Donna",
        "Description": "In this powerful\u00a0novel from one of the most gifted storytellers to emerge from Canada since Carol Shields, we find \u201call the old-fashioned virtues: a vivid sense of place, an intricate and suspenseful plot, and a feisty heroine whom we can\u2019t help rooting for on every page\u201d (Margot Livesey). Kit Pitman is fourteen and lives in a ramshackle cottage on the outer banks of Newfoundland, where isolation is all she knows. The only visitors are fogbound fishermen and an occasional young man brought ashore to keep the bloodlines clean. But Kit\u2019s isolation is compounded by the mystery that surrounds her family and her illegitimate birth. Her mother, Josie, is mentally retarded and often runs wild among the clapboard houses that dot the shore. Meanwhile, her grandmother Lizzie staunchly guards them both from the disapproving glances pious townsfolk cast their way. But when Lizzie dies suddenly, Kit and her childlike mother are left vulnerable to life\u2019s harsh realities and to unexpected dangers that repeatedly threaten to break them apart. A wrenching story ensues, as Morrissey depicts with exceptional grace the way the lines between mother and daughter in this unlikely relationship, although blurred, are deeply felt. Kit&#39;s Law is a novel of extraordinary, almost mythical power and marks the debut of an enormous new talent.",

Trying to hold on to the evaporating past, she begins to write all that she can remember of her life as a girl in China. Meanwhile, her daughter Ruth, a ghostwriter for authors of self-help books, is losing the ability to speak up for herself in front of the man she lives with and his two teenage daughters. None of her professional sound bites and pat homilies works for her personal life: she knows only how to translate what others want to say.Ruth starts suspecting that something is terribly wrong with her mother. As a child, Ruth had been constantly subjected to her mother's disturbing notions about curses and ghosts, and to her repeated threats that she would kill herself, and was even forced by her to try to communicate with ghosts. But now LuLing seems less argumentative, even happy, far from her usual disagreeable and dissatisfied self.While tending to her ailing mother, Ruth discovers the pages LuLing wrote in Chinese, the story of her tumultuous and star-crossed life, and is transported to a backwoods village known as Immortal Heart. There she learns of secrets passed along by a mute nursemaid, Precious Auntie; of a cave where \"dragon bones\" are mined, some of which may prove to be the teeth of Peking Man; of the crumbling ravine known as the End of the World, where Precious Auntie's scattered bones lie, and of the curse that LuLing believes she released through betrayal. Like layers of sediment being removed, each page reveals secrets of a larger mystery: What became of Peking Man? What was the name of the Bonesetter's Daughter? And who was Precious Auntie, whose suicide changed the path of LuLing's life? Within LuLing's calligraphed pages awaits the truth about a mother's heart, what she cannot tell her daughter yet hopes she will never forget.Set in contemporary San Francisco and in the Chinese village where Peking Man is being unearthed, The Bonesetter's Daughter is an excavation of the human spirit: the past, its deepest wounds, its most profound hopes. The story conjures the pain of broken dreams, the power of myths, and the strength of love that enables us to recover in memory what we have lost in grief. Over the course of one fog-shrouded year, between one season of falling stars and the next, mother and daughter find what they share in their bones through heredity, history, and inexpressible qualities of love.",

The forty-something single mother has worked hard to raise her beloved daughter -- now twenty-seven and recently married. The offspring of a terrible event, Eden's daughter, Melissa, has long been the jewel of Eden's life, the one for whom she would sacrifice anything and everything. But sooner or later a woman must come into her own, and that's what Eden tries to do when she moves to Arundel, North Carolina, to take ownership of Farrington Manor, a beautiful old house filled with charm and memories that was willed to Eden by the person who cared for her when she needed it most. Torn between the desire to stay with her daughter and the need to build a separate life on her own, Eden opts for some distance and some much-needed perspective. But it's not long before she realizes that sometimes you have to go back before you can start over.Arriving in Arundel -- the South's prettiest small town -- Eden quickly learns that looks can be deceiving when her move is met with delight in some quarters and jealousy in others. Pursued by two eligible bachelors -- the rugged Jared McBride and Braddon Granville, local lawyer and town catch -- Eden is flattered, and more than a little suspicious. Juggling the attentions of two men is hard enough, but soon Eden's bid to start over plunges her in the middle of a mystery that threatens not just her plans and reputation, but her very life. Can she use one man to save her from the other?",

Also living in Zurich at this time was a British consula official called Henry Carr, a man acquainted with Joyce through the theater and later through a lawsuit concerning a pair of trousers. Taking Carr as his core, Stoppard spins this historical coincidence into a masterful and riotously funny play, a speculative portrait of what could have been the meeting of these profoundly influential men in a germinal Europe as seen through the lucid, lurid, faulty, and wholy riveting memory of an aging Henry Carr.",

His assignment: ensure that the weapons are destroyed before they disappear into a terrorist pipeline pointed south, toward the Middle East. Unofficially, however, Grafton has learned that there are those in his own government who would prefer to see his mission fail - and who will go to any length to stop it.A hemisphere away, off the coast of the Canary Islands, the body of British billionaire and media magnate Nigel Keren has been found floating in the sea near his yacht. Although Keren allegedly died of natural causes, Grafton's contacts in Israeli intelligence - the Mossad - have evidence that he was the victim of a hit squad from within the CIA. It's the kind of knowledge that could prove fatal to Grafton - as well as to his wife and daughter. But he cannot back off: if the freelance operation succeeds, it could fan the flames of Middle East hostility into an international conflagration.In a world of shifting loyalties and shifting allegiances, the rules Grafton used to live by no longer apply. The countdown to Armageddon may have already begun, and the only thing Grafton knows for sure is - as a soldier among spies - his rear flank is dangerously exposed. He has been targeted for assassination, and the conspiracy is clearly stamped: Made in America.",

It provides the components to create a powerful small-group experience, including video presentations, a leader's guide with activities for class sessions and home use, and a thoughtful, inspiring participant's book written by Adam Hamilton, the dynamic young pastor of The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kansas. But it is more than that. A Pastor's Guide with CD-ROM provides the information and tools needed to create a congregation-wide event that will reach beyond the classroom, beyond the sanctuary, and into the community, bringing young people and families into the church who ordinarily might only stop by on Christmas or Easter. \"Making Love Last a Lifetime is a comprehensive program for reaching new people, creating excitement, launching new small groups, and strengthening existing classes.

Through the work of Freud, Sullivan, Erikson, Horney, and other theorists, he thoroughly explores the origin, and development of the psychoanalytic theory and its relevance and application to modern therapeutic methods.As a result of his extensive work with schizoid patients who are detached, withdrawn, and unable to form real human relations, Dr. Guntrip has come to regard the self as the ?fundamental psychological concept' and psychoanalysis as the ?study of its growth.' According to Dr. Guntrip modern psychoanalytic therapy provides a kind of personal relationship in which the alienated, stunted self is given the potential for a healthy growth and development which put it in touch with other persons and objects. The author firmly believes that the analyst, through careful insight, recognition, and a mental awareness of the emergence of the inner core of isolation, can enable the patient to find his own reality as a person.",

He evokes the profound intellectual impact the infinite has exercised on the human mind--from the \"horror infiniti\" of the Greeks to the works of M. C. Escher; from the ornamental designs of the Moslems, to the sage Giordano Bruno, whose belief in an infinite universe led to his death at the hands of the Inquisition. But above all, the book describes the mathematician's fascination with infinity--a fascination mingled with puzzlement. \"Maor explores the idea of infinity in mathematics and in art and argues that this is the point of contact between the two, best exemplified by the work of the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, six of whose works are shown here in beautiful color plates.\"--Los Angeles Times \"[Eli Maor's] enthusiasm for the topic carries the reader through a rich panorama.\"--Choice \"Fascinating and enjoyable.... places the ideas of infinity in a cultural context and shows how they have been espoused and molded by mathematics.\"--Science",
