        "Title": "Crossing Ocean Parkway",
        "Authors": "By Torgovnick, Marianna De Marco",
        "Description": "Growing up as an Italian American in Bensonhurst, Marianna De Marco longed for college, culture, and upward mobility. Her daydreams circled around WASP heroes on television - like Robin Hood and the Cartwright family - but in Brooklyn she never encountered any. So she associated moving up with Ocean Parkway, a street that divides the working-class Italian neighborhood where she was born from the middle-class Jewish neighborhood into which she married. This book is Torgovnick's unflinching account of crossing cultural boundaries in American life, of what it means to be an Italian American woman who became a scholar and literary critic.At the start, Torgovnick goes home to Bensonhurst soon after the shocking racial murder of Yusuf Hawkins. The first essay describes life in \"the neighborhood\" as viewed from the present, with clarity, empathy, and tough critique. The title essay, \"Crossing Ocean Parkway,\" revisits the famous Brooklyn thoroughfare as a symbol of culture that gradually lost its luster. Another essay charts her arrival as a new Ph.D. in a small New England college town, where she faced the painful imperatives of class, power, and privilege. Amid the careful manners and stifling complacency of the college, she suffered the death of her first child; her moving account of this death ends part one.In the book's second section, Torgovnick interweaves autobiographical moments with engrossing interpretations of American cultural icons from Dr. Dolittle to Lionel Trilling, The Godfather to Camille Paglia. Her experiences allow her to probe the cultural tensions in America caused by competing ideas of individuality and community, upward mobility and ethnic loyalty, acquisitiveness and spirituality.Called back to Bensonhurst by the illness and death of her father, Torgovnick concludes with a homecoming epilogue. The desire to be like others gives way to her recognition that likeness is never complete; Torgovnick knows she will always be crossing Ocean Parkway.",

Under the editorship of Peter J.

        "Description": "Kirby Puckett's incredible catch above the center field fence and his eleventh-inning home run in Game Six of the 1991 World Series turned that championship series around - and ignited a nationwide fandom for the smiling center fielder of the Minnesota Twins. His stunning statistics, which include a career batting average ranked third among all active players, five Gold Glove awards, two World Series rings, and a perennial spot on the All-Star team, have all been accomplished by a guy with a chunky, fireplug build who admits he can't even touch his toes. Kirby Puckett's sunny disposition, his huge talent, and his obvious love for the game have won him the respect and affection of fans and ballplayers everywhere, and in this marvelous, personal account, Puckett tells us how he became the player and the person we admire today.Puckett movingly describes his journey from a childhood spent playing ball on concrete \"fields\" between apartment buildings on Chicago's tough south side to a spectacular career anchoring a major league franchise. The youngest of nine children, Puckett played ball wherever and whenever he could, but few baseball scouts ventured into the housing project where his family lived.His break came when he was discovered by a scout who had come to watch his own son play in an Illinois collegiate summer league. After a mere two years in their minor league system, the Twins gambled on a still unseasoned Puckett, calling him up to replace an ailing outfielder. He went four-for-five in his major league debut. The rest is history.Nine years and two World Series later, Puckett continues to thrill fans with his hardnosed approach to the game, his bold batting style and refusal to play cat-and-mouse with pitchers, and his homer-stealing catches at the center field wall. He gives us an insider's look at some of the exciting moments and great players he's encountered on the field, as well as telling the real story of his cliffhanging negotiations with the Twins after the '92 season, which resulted in a hard-won five-year contract - much to the relief of virtually the entire population of Minnesota!He takes us inside the locker room to experience the genuine camaraderie and team unity that keep up the \"Twins mystique.\" Minnesota has a reputation as an always-bustling team propelled by a solid work ethic, and Puckett is a driving force behind that reputation. He introduces Tom Kelly, the highly regarded and lively team manager, and fellow Twin superstars past and present, including Frank Viola, Kent Hrbek, Gary Gaetti, Tom Brunansky, and many more.Unswervingly upbeat, Kirby Puckett will charm readers as naturally as he charges up his teammates on and off the field with his thoroughly engaging tale of life playing the game he loves with the team he loves.",

Not diet, not smoking, not exercise, not stress, not genetics, not drugs, not surgery.\"He reveals that the real epidemic in modern culture is not only physical heart disease but also what he calls spiritual heart disease: loneliness, isolation, alienation, and depression.  He shows how the very defenses that we think protect us from emotional pain are often the same ones that actually heighten our pain and threaten our survival.  Dr. Ornish outlines eight pathways to intimacy and healing that have made a profound difference in his life and in the life of millions of others in turning sadness into happiness, suffering into joy.",

In his distinguished career, Dr. Bova has predicted many scientific developments. Now he explores the future effects of science and technology on the human life span and discovers that one day, death will no longer be the inevitable end of life. Dr. Bova guides readers through worldwide research into the biochemical processes that causes aging and death, and shows what scientists are discovering about stopping, perhaps even reversing them. With crystal-clear prose, Dr. Bova explains how science could maintain the youth and vigor of a fifty-year-old indefinitely and the consequences for marriage and family ties. He also offers provocative thoughts on the tumultuous societal consequences of such biomedical breakthroughs, as greatly extended life spans and virtual immortality transform institutions like Medicare, Social Security, pension plans, life insurance, even the very foundations of work and retirement. Here is a compelling, startling, understandable, and vitally important study of humankind's greatest challenge -- and most tantalizing opportunity.The first immortals are already living among us.

        "Description": "When thirty-four-year-old Chloe Morgan appears on Hank Oliver's doorstep in Cameron, Arizona, she arrives with more than her old white German shepherd, Hannah, and a rambunctious young horse in tow. Chloe is pregnant with Hank's child, and she's as tough-talking and vulnerable, skittish and tender as when last we saw her in Jo-Ann Mapson's acclaimed first novel, Hank & Chloe. As Chloe and Hank settle somewhat uneasily into domesticity, a local Navajo legend named Junior Whitebear returns home to collect his father's ashes and renew his own spirit after years spent in the art-world fast lane. When Junior arrives at the reservation, he doesn't expect to find a son he fathered unwittingly nine years ago; nor is he looking to fall in love with Chloe and to deliver her baby girl. Both events change his life, and the lives of those around him, forever. A passionate love story, Loving Chloe explores the emotional complexity of a love triangle with sympathy, humor, and compassion.",

        "Authors": "By Brandon, Jay",
        "Description": "It's mid-August, and San Antonio is on edge. Over the summer three children have briefly disappeared, each returning home with chillingly similar accounts of where they have been - of the man who took them in, tended to them, touched them in all the wrong ways. It is a story that has scraped a raw nerve. The city wants action, demanding immediate retribution: Find and punish the man the newspapers call the \"serial child molester.\"For District Attorney Mark Blackwell, in the midst of a reelection campaign, the case could be a windfall - an opportunity to make headlines and the six o'clock news. His old boss, former DA Eliot Quinn, has come to him with a deal. The molester, represented by high-powered attorney Austin Paley, wants to turn himself in...not to the police, but to the District Attorney himself. Weary of compromise, jaded by the system's failures, Blackwell sees a chance not only to energize his campaign, but to recharge his own passion - a clear-cut case of doing good in the face of evil.But the clarity is an illusion, and the windfall is about to turn into a Texas-sized tornado with Mark Blackwell at the eye of the storm. The confessor recants, the children are unable to identify him, and the case begins to crumble. And all the DA has left is questions: What could drive an innocent man to give himself up, subject himself to a city's violent hatred and recrimination? Was he coerced and by whom? And why would a lawyer in Austin Paley's position dirty his hands by taking on such a client?The answers lie in the memories of one ten-year-old boy. Tommy Algren has seen the pictures in the paper, the reports on TV, and he has a story to tell, a story that could rock the city to its very foundations. Tommy's testimony leads to a shocking revelation, one which pits Blackwell against the city's power elite - the old boys' network, where promises are always kept, favors always returned, and secrets never violated. To bring out the truth, Blackwell will have to cross his mentor, Eliot Quinn, a man who knows where the bodies are buried...and who may have buried a few himself. For in a world of money, power, and influence, the line between innocence and guilt is just another string to be pulled.",

In the title story, a young newlywed's unexpected pregnancy makes her marriage suddenly, unbearably real. In \"The Solution to Canned Peas,\" a couple try but fail to transcend the habits of mistrust. In \"Slim Young Woman in No Distress,\" a mother braves her precocious son's wrath at her divorce. In \"Exit Interview,\" an advertising executive contemplates the eclipse of his future by family tragedies he is helpless to prevent or to articulate.Rife with the ill luck, high drama, and poetry of the Irish, these dozen magical tales illuminate the mysteries at the heart of childhood, marriage, parenthood, and aging. They are sure to lift Currie to new heights of literary acclaim.",

Where will Sarah's loyalties lie - as a young woman who calls herself a feminist, as the daughter of a white man and a black woman, or as a Razorback fan and a member of the pom-pom squad?

        "Description": "Roxana Robinson's great gift for the telling detail and strong sense of the emotional shoals lurking just beneath even the calmest surface have inspired comparisons to literary greats like John Cheever, Henry James, and Edith Wharton.  In her first novel, we meet Laura, a 29-year-old wife, mother, sister, friend, lover, and erstwhile photographer whose life is painfully out of focus. A month's vacation on the Maine coast with her son, her lover, Ward, and her sister's family is supposed to be an idyllic period of sustenance and calm, but for Laura, who believes that \"entropy governed the world, the universe, and the dinner hour,\" it turns into the ultimate test of her ability to trust herself and others.  With trademark intensity and a deft touch for character and place, Robinson creates a perceptive, believable, and gently humorous portrait of an individual \"waiting for something that would set her life in order.\" Laura is as much a study of light and shadow as the photographs she takes. Beautiful but insecure, talented but unwilling to take risks, loved but unable to make a commitment, she is paralyzed by fear and locked into a stasis that Ward is no longer willing to accept. \"You don't dare take a stand on anything,\" he tells her. \u201cYou're so terrified of failure you don't dare do anything.\u201d When her estranged husband arrives for a weekend visit, however, the emotional collision rocks Laura's inaction, causing a tiny shake of the kaleidoscope that creates a vastly different pattern. The image is razor sharp at last: \"As though she were changing lenses, as though she had suddenly discovered another light source,\" she sees that her life is her own. That new understanding empowers her to make a symbolic -- and a literal -- leap of faith that saves her own life and the lives of those she loves.",

But now, after nine books in the bestselling series, as well as two feature film adventures, Fletch faces the most difficult challenge of his career. When a young man comes calling under the most irregular of circumstances, even the unflappable Fletch is thrown for a loop. \"Like frogs falling from trees in a hard southern rain,\" the boy one day appears at Fletch's barnyard door - and to complicate matters considerably, he's claiming to be Fletch's son.Given that the young stranger is sporting prison garb, that there has just been a jailbreak in the vicinity, and that he is traveling in the company of a man who takes pride in spouting unconscionable sentiments of white supremacist hate, Fletch reserves judgment before handing out any cigars. Yet as a reporter who has lived his life by the credo that we are all mysteries awaiting solution, Fletch realizes he has no choice but to sign on for what promises to be the most tumultuous ride of his life.Here is Fletch as you've never seen him before - older, wiser, but with his notoriously reckless sense of humor very much intact. Son of Fletch guarantees a new generation of first-rate detection, rollicking wit, and sheer page-turning suspense.",

Ty Cobb's spikes, Lou Gehrig's glove, Babe Ruth's bat, Mickey Mantle's jersey, and more than 200 other genuine articles are featured in this delightful tribute to the game and to the players that forged its colorful history, from the early days to the modern era.Like an archaeologist digging for the remnants of earlier civilizations, photographer Bret Wills has unearthed amazing artifacts, including often overlooked memorabilia that are inextricably tied to the allure of a day at the ballpark: ticket stubs and press passes, an umpire's broom, a turnstile from a demolished stadium, a scorecard from the 1907 World Series, a scoreboard numeral, and much more.These objects and their stories provide an evocative journey through the great moments of baseball, as well as a fascinating look at the evolution of the game and its equipment.It's all here - the heart and soul of major league baseball, the legends and lore, the bats and masks and gloves that helped shape America's favorite pastime.",

Now, drawing on four decades of consulting with companies struggling to \"reinvent\" themselves on the brink of cataclysmic restructuring or even extinction, Roy Harmon constructs a compelling three-pronged \"reinvention\" model (processes, technology, and people) which, when driven by long-term strategic vision, provides a flexible blueprint from which to spearhead ongoing change.Using detailed examples from Andersen Consulting's worldwide practice, Harmon reinvents business operations in specific fields including retailing, health care, financial services, and even government, and targets other areas relevant to all industries, from computer technology to office organization. He shows how the most important process improvements (such as reorganizing functionally structured operations into \"work cells\") can eliminate bureaucratic and other inefficiencies, and how the latest technology, when combined with an energized workforce committed to action, can give teeth to the reinvention model.",

        "Description": "It's 1993. The Chicago Cubs win ten straight to tie the Phillies on the last day of the season. With an exhausted pitching staff, the Cubs call on thirty-two-year-old rookie and clubhouse oddball Sam Ward to pitch the big game. For Ward, a career minor leaguer up for his sixth \"cup of coffee,\" it's his first start in the big leagues. His chance to prove that he's not a \"baseball bum,\" that maybe his wife shouldn't have left him, that he's not crazy.But something is wrong. Sam Ward is not getting the calls from umpire Ernie Kolacka. And he doesn't know why. Was it that wisecrack he made a few years ago at the sports dinner, the gay rights petition, the clubhouse incident with President Nixon? Sam only knows that he has to win. What he doesn't know is that the game is fixed.Sixty-year-old Ernie Kolacka, forced into retirement, is umpiring the last game of a distinguished career - a consolation prize in an otherwise disappointing life. His own promising future as a ballplayer shot down in Korea, unhappy in marriage, ignored by his kids, Kolacka hangs on to certain principles that he lives by - integrity, hard work, loyalty to friends. But when his principles collide, Kolacka is suddenly faced with an unbearable moral dilemma.Writing his first novel, Jim Bouton, author of the classic Ball Four, shows an original comic touch with the creation of Sam Ward. Eliot Asinof, veteran novelist and author of the acclaimed Eight Men Out, is the gruff and crusty voice of Ernie Kolacka. In alternating chapters, Ward and Kolacka face off in a duel of competing characters whose lives are on the line - one ball game seen from two utterly different points of view. A double-blind study of balls and strikes, right and wrong, life and death.As Sam watches the breaks fall against him, he struggles for a way to triumph. As Ernie feels his career, his integrity, slipping away, he balances on the edge between honor and death.",
