Deeply in love, they escape, and find refuge in the farmhouse of Martha, a retired schoolteacher and widow. But the couple is not alone-Lynnie has just given birth to a baby girl. When the authorities catch up to them that same night, Homan escapes into the darkness, and Lynnie is caught. But before she is forced back into the institution, she whispers two words to Martha: \"Hide her.\" And so begins the 40-year epic journey of Lynnie, Homan, Martha, and baby Julia-lives divided by seemingly insurmountable obstacles, yet drawn together by a secret pact and extraordinary love.",

        "Authors": "By Gill, Bartholomew",
        "Description": "Bartholomew Gill's superb crime series featuring Chief Superintendent Peter McGarr of the Dublin police gets better, richer, and more flavorful with the passage of time. Now the gifted author writing at the top of his form gives us a spellbinding work of mystery and suspense in which guilt lies as heavily on the shoulders of saints as on those of sinners and purity and violence coexist in the depths of the human soul.A priest approaches Peter McGarr on the chief superintendent's rare day off. The man of the cloth has come to report a murder and to make a bizarre request: Could McGarr have the death officially listed as an accident and then pursue the investigation in secret? The answer, of course, is no.Perhaps the chief superintendent would have been wiser to have accepted Father Duggan's offer of covert aid, since McGarr's official investigation is being oddly opposed at every turn. Yet the deeper McGarr digs, the closer he is drawn to a secret order of religious zealots called Opus Dei a group devoted to enforcing the Lord's edicts no matter what the cost in money...or human life.But there are unexpected consequences to looking too closely at the activities of an organization that guards its anonymity as obsessively as it pursues its \"sacred calling.\" More death is doubtlessly in the offing as a web of dark secrets, vengeance, and blood spins out across a century. And suddenly the stakes are being raised to a chilling new level, as the madness reaches out to touch the one place where Peter McGarr is most vulnerable: the precious heart of his own adored family.Once again author Bartholomew Gill presents a splendid, richly atmospheric warts-and-all view of his beloved Ireland, in a novel of mystery that stands proudly among not only the best of his previous works but among the best crime novels of the past decade.",

Smokehill is home to about two hundred of the few remaining draco australiensis, which is extinct in the wild. Keeping a preserve for dragons is controversial: detractors say dragons are extremely dangerous and unjustifiably expensive to keep and should be destroyed. Environmentalists and friends say there are no records of them eating humans and they are a unique example of specialist evolution and must be protected. But they are up to eighty feet long and breathe fire. On his first overnight solo trek, Jake finds a dragon?a dragon dying next to the human she killed. Jake realizes this news could destroy Smokehill? even though the dead man is clearly a poacher who had attacked the dragon first, that fact will be lost in the outcry against dragons. But then Jake is struck by something more urgent?he sees that the dragon has just given birth, and one of the babies is still alive. What he decides to do will determine not only their futures, but the future of Smokehill itself.",

Gabriel, former professor of Islamic history at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, disagrees. He says that terrorists are practicing Islam just as Muhammad intended. As a child, Gabriel grew up in a Muslim family in Egypt and was heavily indoctrinated. By the age of twelve he had memorized the entire Qur'an. He went on to become a top student at the most prestigious Islamic university in the world, Al-Azhar in Cairo, Egypt. As a student and professor of Islamic history, he rubbed shoulders with those who are at the forefront of propagating the tenets of Islamic terrorism. He actually took classes with Sheik Umar Abd al-Rahman, who was convicted of masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bomb attack and is now in prison. In his book Gabriel explains:    \u2022How Islam was influenced by the warlike Arabian culture of the 7th century    \u2022Atrocities committed by Muhammad in the name of Allah    \u2022The story of the Egyptian student who came to study education in America and went on to write the first handbook of terrorism in the twentieth century    \u2022The prominence of jihad (war against infidels) in Islamic theology    \u2022How Egyptian fundamentalists murdered and robbed Christians to raise funds for terrorism    \u2022The difference between a moderate Muslim and a fundamentalist MuslimFor the readers of this book, the motive behind Islamic world activity will no longer be a mystery. Each action is obviously rooted in the philosophy of Islam. Now both the Christian and the political world must decide how to react to Muhammad's revelation.",

        "Description": "Every March, the NCAA men's basketball tournament blankets newspapers and the Internet, and attracts millions of television viewers over the course of three weeks. Will a perennial favorite like Duke win? Or will it be a dark horse like Gonzaga? The phenomenon known as March Madness galvanizes a nation of viewers as few other sports events can. The reason? Bracketology. America eagerly watches as 64 teams become 32, then 16, then 8, then 4, then 2, and finally #1. Now it's time to use the same rigorous method for everything that really matters in culture, people, history, the arts and more. In The Enlightened Bracketologist the editors have organized the world's most haunting and maddeningly subjective questions into a scheme of binary pairings that finally reveal what is truly the best in its class: La Tache or Chateau Latour? (1) Barry Bonds or Terrell Owens? (2) \"Vissi d'arte\" or \"Dove Sono\"? (3) OJ verdict or JFK assassination? (4) \"Top of the world, Ma\" or \"Nobody's perfect\"? (5) Two by two, The Enlightened Bracketologist pits our cultural mainstays against each other; only the finest survive. Every double-page spread of this book will contain a series of brackets compiled by experts and celebrities, with text call-outs that highlight the reason why one competitor moves on and another doesn't. Already committed are Elvis Costello on popular songs; David Bouley on cookbooks; Leon Fleisher on piano music; Rene\u00e9 Fleming on opera arias; Henry Beard on French phrases; Joseph Ward on wine. Richard Sandomir is the award-winning sports television columnist for the New York Times. His previous books include Bald Like Me: The Hair-Raising Adventures of Baldman and, with Rick Wolff, Life for Real Dummies and Don't Worry, Stop Sweating...Use Deodorant.

        "Authors": "By Hall, Kermit L. (EDT)",
        "Description": "The Supreme Court has been the site of the great debates of American history, from child labor and prayer in the schools, to busing and abortion. The Oxford Guide to United States Supreme Court Decisions offers lively and insightful accounts of over four hundred of the most important cases ever argued before the Court, from Marbury v. Madison and Scott v. Sandford (the Dred Scott decision) to Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade.      Here are the landmark decisions that have shaped American life, described by some of our most eminent legal scholars. Arranged alphabetically, each entry provides the United States Reports citation, the date the case was argued and decided, the vote of the Justices, who wrote the opinion for the Court, who concurred, and who dissented. More importantly, the entries feature an informative account of the particulars of the case, the legal and social background, the reasoning behind the Court's decision, and the case's impact on American society. Kermit Hall has drawn the material primarily from the acclaimed Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court, revising and updating entries where necessary, and he has written 47 new entries covering recent notable cases, including Clinton v. Jones, Reno v. Shaw, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC. The Guide also features a case index (including all cases mentioned anywhere in the text), a topical index, the Constitution of the United States, an appendix on the Justices, and a legal glossary.      For anyone interested in the great controversies of our time, this invaluable book is a must read--a primer on the epic constitutional battles that have informed American life.",

        "Description": "Print and public-radio journalist Wagner describes rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina.  .  .Despite Kafkaesque experiences with the infamous bureaucratic mess that threatened to undo New Orleans once and for all, the couple held on to their optimism for the city and their little piece of it.  Wagner captures the nostalgia, the heartbreak and the friendships spawned in Katrina's turbulent aftermath with raw emotional honesty free of sentimentality.  Unflinching, humorous and heartfelt.  --Kirkus Reviews    The clich\u00e9 New Orleans gets into people's blood\" happens to be very true--just not always convenient. For Cheryl Wagner, along with her indie-band boyfriend, a few eccentric pals, and two aging basset hounds, abandoning the city she loved wasn't an option.  This is the story of Cheryl's disturbing surprise view from her front porch after she moved back home to find everything she treasured in shambles.  .  .and her determined, absurd, and darkly funny three-year journey of trying to piece it all back together.  In the same heartfelt and hilarious voice that has drawn thousands of listeners to her broadcasts on Public Radio International's This American Life, Wagner shares her unique yet universal story of rebuilding a life after it's been flooded, dried, and died.  .  .    \"Dark, funny, generous and jarring--occasionally tragic but never sentimental.\" --Paul Tough, author of Whatever It Takes: Geoffrey Canada's Quest to Change Harlem and America    \"A wonderful, touching, thoughtful, crazy, loving book.\" --Frederick Barthelme, author of Waveland and eleven other works of fiction including Elroy Nights, a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award and a New York Times Notable Book     \" A wild, blood and guts lived-to-tell-all memoir.\" --Porochista Khakpour, author of Sons and Other Flammable Objects    \"The book would be heartbreaking if it weren't so funny, so clear-eyed, and so beautifully fierce.\"   --James Whorton Jr., author of Frankland    \"I love it.\" -- Pete Jordan, author of Dishwasher: One Man's Quest to Wash Dishes in Fifty States  \"Imagine if Jack Kerouac had lived through the flood and wrote you a long, personal letter from the wreckage.\" --Jonathan Goldstein, author of Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bible! and Host of CBC's and PRI's radio show WireTap\"Wagner writes with honesty and humor.\" --Annie Choi, author of Happy Birthday or Whatever  \"A work of art, unsparing of everything, including itself.\" --Jack Pendarvis, author of Awesome  The Times-Picayune   Wagner's is a distinctive and funny voice, with that tone of the committed (and at times should be committed) New Orleanian.    The title comes, as if you can't guess, from those infuriating stories of comparative loss post-Katrina, when those who had lost everything were subjected to the litanies of minor inconvenience by the more fortunate. \"Everyone's loss is big to them,\" Wagner kept telling herself. And so it was. \"I was not interested in sifting and weighing suck on a bunch of tiny scales,\" she continued. \"Suck was too hard to quantify. There was plenty enough suck to go around. Sitting around measuring it wasn't going to fix anything.\"       What makes this story uniquely memorable is Wagner's wise and wisecracking voice, the broken heart beneath the bravado. Working on a survey of gutted/non-gutted buildings, she writes, \"By the time you finished hearing people's problems, you wished you were a professional busybody or the mayor or the governor or a city inspector or anyone who could and would actually do something.\" And who hasn't had that feeling, way back then or as recently as yesterday?       Finally, Wagner and her boyfriend end up with \"the dogs, sanity and each other.\" And we end up with this fine book, with its searing honesty, its gallows humor and its survivor spirit.",

But there's another audience out there, too, showing up ever more frequently on Antiques Roadshow--those obsessive, bitten-by-the-bug collectors. Bring on the \"Maltese Falcon\" posters!Celebrating the collectible--that 20th-century object that brings with it less monetary value than passion, nostalgia, quirky appeal, and just plain pleasure--ANTIQUES ROADSHOW COLLECTIBLES focuses on 12 major areas that inspire both the thrill of the chase and the thrill of discovery: furniture, photographs, posters and illustration art, costume jewelry and wristwatches, dolls, toys, advertising memorabilia, sports, glass and pottery, and more. A guide to value rather than price, it is packed with a wealth of information that will help turn any interested flea market fiend into a first-class collector. From the innovative design of Bertoia chairs to the high-quality crafting of costume jewely to the surprising variety of PEZ dispensers, here are 416 pages brimming with information. Bound into the book is a 32-page full-color section, while hundreds of black-and-white photographs illustrate every chapter. There are Antiques Roadshow discoveries, tips from experts and appraisers, the steps to becoming a focused collector--even how to use pieces without compromising their value.

        "Description": "Imagine announcing a new series of sermons and seeing worship attendance increase by 1,000 people on the first Sunday of the new series. Or consider a pastor developing sermon plans two to three years out. What kind of pastor sits in a bar with a notepad just looking for ideas for sermons? Or has as his aim to preach the best prepared, best researched sermons his congregation has ever heard? All of these and more explain part of the reason the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection has grown from four people to over 10,000 in just thirteen years. In Unleashing the Word, Adam Hamilton helps pastors and church leaders consider the purpose, planning, and execution of excellent preaching. He offers detailed descriptions of the sermon planning, writing and preaching process behind one of the fastest growing churches in the United States. He includes numerous personal anecdotes and enough sermon ideas to keep the average pastor busy for years! Finally, after you have read how sermons are planned and prepared at the Church of the Resurrection you can watch the included DVD which features four full-length sermons and other resources to help you apply what you\u2019ve read in the book. If you only buy one book on preaching this year, this is the book you must buy! Praise for Unleashing the Word:\u00a0\"I wish I had read this book early in my thirty-eight year pastoral ministry.

        "Description": "Though ongoing economic, political, and social crises have kept Indonesia in the headlines for over a year, Southeast Asia's troubled giant remains poorly understood in the United States. This 17,000-island archipelago, ranging over 3,000 miles from east to west, occupies a strategic location that connects the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean to East Asia. The fourth-most populous country in the world, Indonesia is home to as many Muslims as the entire Middle East/North Africa region. It is first among equals in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is a key part of East Asia's prevailing balance of power. Wrenched by the domestic turmoil that commenced with the collapse of the rupiah in the fall of 1997, Indonesia is only now starting to receive the attention in the United States that its size and potential warrant.This book responds to the critical need of policymakers, practitioners, and scholars for current research on Indonesia. The authors, all acclaimed international experts on Indonesia, focus on those areas that are particularly nettlesome for Indonesia's new leaders: the economy, religion and ethnicity, civil society, and the military, with a concluding chapter on the International Monetary Fund and U.S. policy toward Indonesia. The result of their inquiries is a rich, forward-looking volume that provides a first glimpse into the future of Indonesia in the post-Suharto era.",

Responding to the notion of a handbook as a reference tool, sections not heavily used by readers of prior editions have been deleted and some chapters have been combined. The sample speeches in the new appendix are brief examples of the major types of speeches given in academic and non-academic settings. Particular emphasis has been placed on including new electronic and telecommunication tools available for speakers, ranging from Internet research to presentational software. These innovations have been here long enough now, so the text does not just celebrate their availability but provides cautions about using them uncritically or inappropriately.",
