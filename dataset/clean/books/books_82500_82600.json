        "Description": "A New York Times Notable BookA powerfully candid memoir about growing up white in Detroit and the conflicted point of view it produced.Raised in Detroit during the \u201870s, \u201880s, and \u201890s, Paul Clemens saw his family growing steadily isolated from its surroundings: white in a predominately black city, Catholic in an area where churches were closing at a rapid rate, and blue-collar in a steadily declining Rust Belt. As the city continued to collapse\u2014from depopulation, indifference, and the racial antagonism between blacks and whites\u2014Clemens turned to writing and literature as his lifeline, his way of dealing with his contempt for suburban escapees and his frustration with the city proper. Sparing no one\u2014particularly not himself\u2014this is an astonishing examination of race and class relations from a fresh perspective, one forged in a city both desperate and hopeful.",

Thomas\u2019s reach is broad and daring, from the shtetls of her forebears to the abuses of today\u2019s petrochemical industry. Mourning the murdered Lithuanian Jews of the Holocaust and celebrating the cholesterol-rich menu of the River Run caf\u00e9 intercut with local scandals are made to seem appropriate apposites in this lively collection.\u201d\u2014Maxine Kumin\u201cThis delightful\u2014and long overdue\u2014collection of poems shows Susan Thomas at her delicious best: \u2018So many ways / to eat chicken: / fricasseed and boiled / saut\u00e9ed with herbs and shallots / roasted, stuffed with mushrooms . . .\u2019 Hard not to make a culinary comparison about the range and variety of these poems\u2014poems about history, family history, landscape, myth, fairy tale; the whole world is here to be savored and enjoyed.

Here, after all, we find art, fairy tales, history, a murdered girl, King Kong, Penelope, mad plumbers, ghosts, even objects themselves in a dialogue that tells us they exist now, in the fabulous world created by Susan Thomas\u2019s terrific vision. Which is to say that this is a book that redefines our own world, and so ourselves, enrichng us with its particulars, broadening us its vision, so that, like her, we find a way to \u2018refuse to be a blur / on desire\u2019s muffled horizion.\u2019\u201d\u2014Richard Jackson",

They garden, make an occasional A in school, and play baseball. Nothing especially interesting has happened to the twins until they accidentally interrupt their father's experiment.Then the two boys are thrown across time and space. They find themselves alone in the desert, where, if they believe in unicorns, they can find unicorns, and whether they believe or not, mammoths and manticores will find them.The twins are rescued by Japheth, a man from the nearby oasis, but before he can bring them to safety, Dennys gets lost. Each boy is quickly embroiled in the conflicts of this time and place, whose populations includes winged seraphim, a few stray mythic beasts, perilous and beautiful nephilim, and small, long lived humans who consider Sandy and Dennys giants. The boys find they have more to do in the oasis than simply getting themselves home--they have to reunite an estranged father and son, but it won't be easy, especially when the son is named Noah and he's about to start building a boat in the desert.Praise for Many Waters:\u201cSandy and Dennys, twins and middle children in the Newbery-winning A Wrinkle in Time, are transported to the time just before the Flood. . .

        "Description": "If America is to be preserved, it will be due to the brave efforts of the patriots who lead the movement to save the nation.  Awakened by the revelations in the post-9/11 period on the ever-growing illegal immigration crisis, Daniel Sheehy dedicated four years to exploring America\u2019s virtual open-borders policy. The fruits of his research\u2014Fighting Immigration Anarchy\u2014illustrates the inspiring grassroots efforts being made by ordinary citizens taking extraordinary steps to awaken America to the multitude of problems caused by the government\u2019s reckless immigration positions.   In the wake of this spreading chaos have come massive job displacements for American workers, increased crime, schools overwhelmed by non-English-speaking students, bankrupt hospitals, and other serious problems.    Fighting Immigration Anarchy focuses on the struggles of dozens of citizens\u2014including chapter-length portraits of eight major citizen activists\u2014to wake up their fellow Americans to the encroaching danger. As with the brave public servants celebrated in Profiles in Courage, the patriots chosen for this book are as varied as America, yet all underwent personal transformations when they saw the nation\u2019s peril, putting aside all     individual concerns to make saving the country their top priority. Among the patriots are:  \u2022        An auto mechanic from South Central Los Angeles who remade himself into a powerful talk radio host and public speaker to tell the story of the black community as America\u2019s canary in the immigration coal mine.\u2022        A retired CPA and a former schoolteacher who co-founded the Minuteman Project and brought the illegal immigration crisis to the national stage.\u2022        A freshman congressman from Colorado who founded the Immigration Reform Caucus and became the nation\u2019s spokesman for border security after 9/11.    The heroic advocates of change chronicled in Fighting Immigration Anarchy and their urgent brand of citizen activism offer the only effective model of curbing illegal immigration, fighting corporate globalism, and preserving American sovereignty.",

        "Authors": "By Shine, Darla",
        "Description": "Says former desperate housewife Darla Shine to stay-at-home moms everywhere: What have you got to complain about? A modern-day guide to keeping house, raising kids, and loving life. Darla Shine was once a desperate housewife. Being at home with two small children and a husband who was rarely home was enough to drive her crazy. She left her high-profile job as a television producer after her son was born, while her husband continued to move up the corporate ladder. Like many of her stay-at-home-mom friends, Shine employed a housekeeper and baby-sitters so she could spend her time running to the salon, the club, and out to lunch. Then one day she was whining to her mother about how terrible her life was, and her mother yelled at her to wake up and stop being so selfish. It was just the wakeup call she needed!The desperate housewife craze of today is sending the wrong message to women and their children everywhere, says Shine. When did being a good mom and being proud to stay home with the kids go out of style? When did it become acceptable to cheat on your husband? When did mothers start dressing like their teenage daughters? Shine finds the standards of today's desperate housewives astonishingly low, and she has set out to teach women how they can be good mothers, look good, and feel good about the choices they make. Being a housewife does not mean you are on house arrest or can't be satisfied in your marriage. So step up, realize that you want to be home with your children, and embrace your life.",

        "Description": "Building Mental Muscle is one of the most stimulating books ever written about how the brain works and how you can maintain, even increase, your own mental ability. It will help you develop skills in six important areas: * Memory * Emotions * Language * Math * Visualization * Executive Planning & Social Interaction The authors have distilled the latest findings in brain research into fascinating short reports accessible to all readers, adding exercises and self-tests designed to stimulate the cells in different brain zones. A skill used in one domain can cross over into another: For example, when you learn the pattern of number intervals in mathematics, you may perceive a pattern of musical intervals for the first time, and thus enjoy music even more. The exercises and puzzles are intriguing challenges; the self-tests offer many opportunities to rate your social intelligence, take your personality inventory, and gauge working memory. For anyone interested in self-improvement and in how the brain really works, Building Mental Muscle is essential reading. Some of the research findings in Building Mental Muscle include: * The simple lifestyle changes that can boost the rate at which your brain grows neurons to keep your memory sharp* Ways to trick your emotional brain into storing new information permanently and how to retrieve it from memory when needed* How women's and men's brains process information differently* How brains respond to stress, solve problems, recognize faces, and handle fear* The discovery of a hitherto unknown class of receptor cells in your eyes that your brain uses to set its own internal clock* How to change your mood without drugs or therapy* What you can do to combat or even reverse the gradual decline of cognitive skills as you age Your doctor may not have read about some of the research findings in this book.",

Haught suggests that what is lacking in both of these competing ideologies is the notion of novelty, a necessary component of evolution and the essence of the unfolding of divine Mystery. He argues that Darwin\u2019s disturbing picture of life, instead of being hostile to religion - as scientific skeptics and many believers have thought it to be - actually provides a most fertile setting for mature reflection on the idea of God. Solidly grounded in scholarship, Haught\u2019s explanation of the relationship between theology and evolution is both accessible and engaging.",

        "Description": "\"I've struck it!\" Mark Twain wrote in a 1904 letter to a friend. \"And I will give it away\u2014to you. You will never know how much enjoyment you have lost until you get to dictating your autobiography.\" Thus, after dozens of false starts and hundreds of pages, Twain embarked on his \"Final (and Right) Plan\" for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion\u2014to \"talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment\"\u2014meant that his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for 100 years meant that when they came out, he would be \"dead, and unaware, and indifferent,\" and that he was therefore free to speak his \"whole frank mind.\" The year 2010 marks the 100th anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone and in honor of the cherished tradition of publishing Mark Twain's works, UC Press is proud to offer for the first time Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography in its entirety and exactly as he left it. This major literary event brings to readers, admirers, and scholars the first of three volumes and presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave as he intended.

But her happy family album is ruined when her husband, George, is found naked and dead in a hotel room. As Kiki tracks down George's murderer, she discovers his sordid secret life.  Cruel taunts by George's former flame compel Kiki to spout an unwise threat. When the woman is murdered, Kiki's scissor-sharp words make her the prime suspect.
