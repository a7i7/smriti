The book also includes a summary of the importance of original intent in constitutional jurisprudence; an examination of the events, people, and documents which at the time of the nation's founding were instrumental in adoption of the First Amendment religion clauses; an account of the Supreme Court's efforts in the last two centuries to interpret and apply those clauses; an evaluation of Rehnquist's interpretations of the clauses, with emphasis on his understanding of the framer's original intent; a description of the present tensions the Supreme Court is experiencing in its efforts to formulate a workable framework for applying the religion clauses in church/state controversies; and an evaluation of Rehnquist's church/state philosophy.Davis warns that Rehnquist is leading the Supreme Court away from its separationist readings of the religion clauses and substituting accomodationist readings which, he contends, are neither in keeping with the original intentions of the Founding Fathers nor good for future American church/state relations. The current composition of the court and Rehnquist's pivotal role, Davis maintains, portend serious departures from the Court's traditional separationist stance and the possibility of sweeping changes in its approaches to the religion clauses.",

The ante is high\u2014virtual renunciation of his past\u2014but the jackpot seems even higher\u2014long dreamed-of esteem, success, and arrival.

The public, the press, and even Poe\u2019s own family and friends accept the conclusion that Poe was a second-rate writer who met a disgraceful end as a drunkard. Everyone, in fact, seems to believe this except a young Baltimore lawyer named Quentin Clark, an ardent admirer who puts his own career and reputation at risk in a passionate crusade to salvage Poe\u2019s.As Quentin explores the puzzling circumstances of Poe\u2019s demise, he discovers that the writer\u2019s last days are riddled with unanswered questions the police are possibly willfully ignoring. Just when Poe\u2019s death seems destined to remain a mystery, and forever sealing his ignominy, inspiration strikes Quentin\u2013in the form of Poe\u2019s own stories. The young attorney realizes that he must find the one person who can solve the strange case of Poe\u2019s death: the real-life model for Poe\u2019s brilliant fictional detective character, C. Auguste Dupin, the hero of ingenious tales of crime and detection.In short order, Quentin finds himself enmeshed in sinister machinations involving political agents, a female assassin, the corrupt Baltimore slave trade, and the lost secrets of Poe\u2019s final hours. With his own future hanging in the balance, Quentin Clark must turn master investigator himself to unchain his now imperiled fate from that of Poe\u2019s.Following his phenomenal debut novel, The Dante Club, Matthew Pearl has once again crossed pitch-perfect literary history with innovative mystery to create a beautifully detailed, ingeniously plotted tale of suspense. Pearl\u2019s groundbreaking research\u2013featuring documented material never published before\u2013opens a new window on the truth behind Poe\u2019s demise, literary history\u2019s most persistent enigma.

        "Description": "George Kennan, Charles Bohlen, W. Averell Harriman, William Bullitt, Joseph E. Davies, Llewlleyn Thompson, Jack Matlock: these are important names in the history of American foreign policy. Together with a number of lesser-known officials, these diplomats played a vital role in shaping U.S. strategy and popular attitudes toward the Soviet Union throughout its 75-year history. In The Ambassadors and America's Soviet Policy, David Mayers presents the most comprehensive critical examination yet of U.S. diplomats in the Soviet Union.Mayers' vivid portrayal evokes the social and intellectual atmosphere of the American embassy in the midst of crucial episodes: the Bolshevik Revolution, the Great Purges, the Grand Alliance in World War II, the early Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the rise and decline of detente, and the heady days of perestroika and glasnost. He also offers rare portraits of the professional lives of the diplomats themselves: their adjustment to Soviet life, the quality of their analytical reporting, their contact with other diplomats in Moscow, and their influence on Washington.Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of American diplomacy in its most challenging area, this compelling book fills an important gap in the history of U.S. foreign policy and U.S.-Soviet relations. Readers interested in U.S. foreign policy, the cold war, and the policies and history of the former Soviet Union will find The Ambassadors and America's Soviet Policy an intriguing and informative work.",

Seeking to understand both what happened to middle-class America and what it will take to achieve a \"new New Deal,\" Krugman has created his finest book to date, a work that weaves together a nuanced account of three generations of history with sharp political, social, and economic analysis. This book, written with Krugman's trademark ability to explain complex issues simply, will transform the debate about American social policy in much the same way as did John Kenneth Galbraith's deeply influential book, The Affluent Society.",

In these segments, Olbermann calls out the perpetrators of mismanagement, brutality, cronyism, and the appalling lack of accountability at the highest levels of the Bush administration. In so doing, Olbermann goes where most of the mainstream media fear to tread\u2013and his rapidly expanding audience eagerly follows. In Truth and Consequences, Olbermann collects the best of his Special Comments, presented here with additional observations and other new material. Whether taking to task the likes of Vice President Dick Cheney and (the thankfully former) Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who compare critics of the Iraq War to Nazi appeasers, or giving his impassioned perspective on why torture is un-American and what it really means to support our troops, or grilling timid lawmakers who fail to rein in presidential overreach and abuses of executive power, Olbermann\u2019s devastatingly blunt (and at times wickedly funny) commentary cuts to the core of the duplicity and cynicism of a government that has lost the ability to distinguish between leading our great nation and ruling it. Naturally, Keith Olbermann\u2019s candor and razor-sharp polemic have earned him many detractors and enemies. His antagonists in the media, such as Bill O\u2019Reilly, have mocked him and accused him of rank intolerance. Yes, Keith Olbermann is intolerant\u2013of hypocrisy, demagoguery, fear-mongering, and especially the equation of dissent with treason. In Truth and Consequences, he fights to reclaim for himself and all Americans the dignity of speaking one\u2019s mind and acting on one\u2019s conscience.

        "Description": "From the Persian Gulf to Washington's corridors of power, General Colin Powell has been one of the most visible, respected, and popular military leaders of his time and a peerless role model for African-Americans. Yet, surprisingly the man behind the uniform has remained virtually unknown to the public.Now, on the eve of Powell's retirement from the armed forces, Sacred Honor presents the complete inside story of Colin Powell, from his early days in Harlem to his leadership of American troops in Operation Desert Storm to his involvement in Somalian relief efforts. It also takes a revealing look at Powell's future ambitions, including his possible political aspirations.A press aide to Colin Powell following the Gulf War, David Roth has been granted unique personal access to the general and his inner circle. Combining his own close-up perspective with extensive research, one-of-a-kind interviews with Powell's family and-colleagues - including Presidents Reagan and Bush - and reflections on Powell's speeches and writings, Roth gets behind Colin Powell's public persona in a way no previous biographer has.In addition to this unique biographical portrait, Sacred Honor provides an inspiring testament to the roles that courage, perseverance, and faith play in overcoming personal hardship. The son of Jamaican immigrants, Colin Powell grew up in the tenements of New York. But through determination and an unwavering sense of personal duty, he persevered in school and became an ROTC student at City College of New York. From there, he began to develop into the soldier that George Bush would one day name Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Bush's primary reason for the appointment: \"Because of his character.\"Renowned for his bravery, goodwill, and unquestionable moral integrity, Colin Powell is both a model soldier and the embodiment of all that is good about America. In Sacred Honor, this larger-than-life figure steps out of the headlines and becomes a living, breathing American hero.",

Now his oldest brother, Archer, President of Donovan International, has given Kyle an assignment with explosive international implication, and an alliance that will shake the very core of his being.Lianne Blakely, the illegitimate daughter of a powerful Hong Kong trader and his American mistress, has spent years studying the art of ancient jade, hoping to win the approval of her Chinese family.
