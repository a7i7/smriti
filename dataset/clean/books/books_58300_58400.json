        "Authors": "By Bennett, W. Lance and Paletz, David L. (EDT)",
        "Description": "In the most comprehensive study of the media and foreign policy, twenty distinguished scholars and analysts explain the role played by the mass media and public opinion in the development of United States foreign policy in the Gulf War.Tracing the flow of news, public opinion, and policy decisions from Sadam Hussein's rise to power in 1979, to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, through the outbreak and conclusion of the war, the contributors look at how the media have become key players in the foreign policy process. They examine the pre-war media debate, news coverage during and after the war, how the news-gathering process shaped the content of the coverage, and the media's effect on public opinion and decision makers. We see what goes on behind the scenes in the high tech world of political communication, and are confronted by troubling questions about the ways the government managed coverage of the war and captured journalists at their own news game.Taken by Storm also examines more general patterns in post-Cold war journalism and foreign policy, particularly how contemporary journalistic practices determine whose voices and what views are heard in foreign policy coverage. At stake are the reactions of a vast media audience and the decision of government officials who see both the press and the public and key elements of the policy game.The first book to fully integrate our understanding of the news business, public opinion, and government action, Taken by Storm transcends the limits of the Gulf War to illuminate the complex relationship between the media, the public, and U.S. foreign policy in the late twentieth century.",

        "Title": "The Protestant Reformation (Documentary History of Western Civilization)",
        "Authors": "By Hillerbrand, Hans J.",
        "Description": "\"Many basic questions surround the Reformation. What were its causes? Was it precipitated by the Zeitgeist prevailing in Europe, so that there would have been a religious upheaval even if Luther or Zwingli had died in their cradles? Was the Reformation an authentically religious phenomenon, or the result of certain political, social, or economic developments? Was it 'medievil' or 'modern' in its orientation? What was the teaching of the Reformers? What was the significance of the Reformation? The measure of scholarly agreement with respect to these questions differs; far from offering definitive answers, we can here only call attention to their persistent presence....\"When the reformers who had first ventured a new interpretation of the gospel had passed from the scene, the question which had haunted the Reformation from its very inception--where is truth?--was still contested by the proponents of the old and the new faith. But one fact was beyond dispute: Western Christendom was tragically divided...into no less than five [religious factions]....Though these divisions were the result of intense religious conviction, they could not help but lessen the intensity of religious belief in Europe. The Reformation of the sixteenth century was the last period in the history of Western civilization when men were preoccupied with religion, argued it, fought and even died for it. Its consequences are still with us.\"     --Hans J. Hillerbrand",

        "Description": "Are religious terrorist groups more likely than secular groups to use weapons of mass destruction? How do the media at once promote and combat terrorist attacks? How has terrorism evolved into a multimillion-dollar operation in the Middle East? Bruce Hoffman addresses these questions as he describes the changing face of terrorism, probing the new adversaries, new motivations, and new methods that have surfaced in recent years to challenge many of our most fundamental assumptions about terrorists and how they operate. Hoffman dissects terrorism past and present, charting its evolution and predicting where it might be headed in the next century.These fringe groups are built upon - and react to - a sense of isolation, and are more likely to use weapons of mass destruction than the nationalist terrorist groups with which we are familiar.Hoffman also considers the issue of media coverage and how it relates to political power. Although the media provide a platform for terrorist agendas, terrorists achieve their ultimate political goals by exploiting the media, and are often captured as a result of news reports - as in the Unabomber case. South Africa's African National Congress, which won sympathy for its plight and eventually obtained power in part through terrorist activities, is a rare exception to the rule.",

        "Description": "\u201cI think German Boy has all the qualities of greatness.  I love the book.\u201d -- from the Foreword by Stephen AmbroseAs the Third Reich crumbled in 1945, scores of Germans scrambled to flee the advancing Russian troops. Among them was a little boy named Wolfgang Samuel, who left his home with his mother and sister and ended up in war-torn Strasbourg before being forced farther west into a disease-ridden refugee camp. German Boy is the vivid, true story of their fight for survival as the tables of power turned and, for reasons Wolfgang was too young to understand, his broken family suffered arbitrary arrest, rape, hunger, and constant fear. Because his father was off fighting the war as a Luftwaffe officer, young Wolfgang was forced to become the head of his household, scavenging for provisions and scraps with which to feed his family. Despite his best efforts, his mother still found herself forced to do the unthinkable to survive, and her sacrifices became Wolfgang\u2019s worst nightmares. Somehow, with the resilience only children can muster, he maintained his youth and innocence in little ways\u2013making friends with other young refugees, playing games with shrapnel, delighting in the planes flown by the Americans and the candies the GIs brought. In the end, the Samuels begin life anew in America, and Wolfgang eventually goes on to a thirty-year career in the U.S. Air Force. Bringing fresh insight to the dark history of Nazi Germany and the horror left in its wake, German Boy records the valuable recollections of an innocent\u2019s incredible journey.",

        "Authors": "By Goozner, Merrill",
        "Description": "Why do life-saving prescription drugs cost so much? Drug companies insist that prices reflect the millions they invest in research and development. In this gripping expos\u00e9, Merrill Goozner contends that American taxpayers are in fact footing the bill twice: once by supporting government-funded research and again by paying astronomically high prices for prescription drugs. Goozner demonstrates that almost all the important new drugs of the past quarter-century actually originated from research at taxpayer-funded universities and at the National Institutes of Health. He reports that once the innovative work is over, the pharmaceutical industry often steps in to reap the profit.Goozner shows how drug innovation is driven by dedicated scientists intent on finding cures for diseases, not by pharmaceutical firms whose bottom line often takes precedence over the advance of medicine. A university biochemist who spent twenty years searching for a single blood protein that later became the best-selling biotech drug in the world, a government employee who discovered the causes for dozens of crippling genetic disorders, and the Department of Energy-funded research that made the Human Genome Project possible--these engrossing accounts illustrate how medical breakthroughs actually take place.The $800 Million Pill suggests ways that the government's role in testing new medicines could be expanded to eliminate the private sector waste driving up the cost of existing drugs. Pharmaceutical firms should be compelled to refocus their human and financial resources on true medical innovation, Goozner insists. This book is essential reading for everyone concerned about the politically charged topics of drug pricing, Medicare coverage, national health care, and the role of pharmaceutical companies in developing countries.",

        "Title": "Princes of Ireland The Dublin Saga",
        "Authors": "By Rutherfurd, Edward",
        "Description": "From the bestselling author of LONDON and SARUM - a magnificent epic about love and battle, family life and political intrigue in Ireland over the course of eleven centuries.  THE PRINCES OF IRELAND brilliantly weaves impeccable historical research and mesmerizing storytelling in capturing the essence of a place and its people. Edward Rutherfurd has introduced millions of readers to the human dramas that are the lifeblood of history.  From his first bestseller, SARUM, to the  international sensation LONDON, he has captivated audiences with gripping narratives that follow the fortunes of several fictional families down through the ages.  THE PRINCES OF IRELAND, a sweeping panorama steeped in the tragedy and glory that is Ireland, epitomizes the power and richness of Rutherfurd's storytelling magic. The saga begins in tribal, pre-Christian Ireland during the reign of the fierce and mighty High Kings at Tara, with the tale of two lovers, the princely Conall and the ravishing Deirdre, whose travails cleverly echo the ancient Celtic legend of Cuchulainn.  From that stirring beginning, Rutherfurd takes the reader on a powerfully-imagined journey through the centuries.  Through the interlocking stories of a memorable cast of characters - druids and chieftains, monks and smugglers, noblewomen and farmwives, merchants and mercenaries, rebels and cowards - we see Ireland through the lens of its greatest city. While vividly and movingly conveying the passions and struggles that shaped the character of Dublin, Rutherfurd portrays the major events in Irish history:  The tribal culture of pagan Ireland; the mission of St. Patrick; the coming of the Vikings and the founding of Dublin; the glories of the great nearby monastery of Glendalough and the making of treasures like the Book of Kells; the extraordinary career of Brian Boru; the trickery of Henry II, which gave England its first foothold in Medieval Ireland.  The stage is then set for the great conflict between the English kings and the princes of Ireland,  and the disastrous Irish invasion of England, which incurred the wrath of Henry VIII and where this book, the first of  the two part Dublin Saga, draws to a close, as the path of Irish history takes a dramatic and irrevocable turn. Rich, colorful and impeccably researched, THE PRINCES OF IRELAND is epic entertainment spun by a master.",

How can you attain what you already possess? What is called for here is not effort, but recognition.\" -Anthony de MelloA spiritual director of the first order, Anthony de Mello has touched countless persons worldwide through his bestselling books, the first of which was SADHANA: A WAY TO GOD. His deceptively simple teachings on prayer, meditation, and self-realization -- through his writings, workshops, retreats, and spiritual therapy courses -- have profoundly changed the lives of those who have experienced him.In MASTERING SADHANA, a close friend and associate shares in detail not only personal reminiscences and conversations, but in fact de Mello's own words, as recorded by Valles during a fifteen-day retreat in India, which was the last conducted by Anthony de Mello. Here in essay form are teachings on love, suffering, the self and the non-self, change, awareness, role-playing, and more -- in sum, a guide to the SADHANA way of life.",

        "Title": "Sabotage: America's Enemies within the CIA",
        "Authors": "By Scarborough, Rowan",
        "Description": "How Bush-hating CIA Bureaucrats Are Sabotaging the War on TerrorSince the attacks on September 11, 2001, intelligence collection has become the number-one weapon in the effort to defeat al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. A plot penetrated is an attack stopped. And to the outside observer, the CIA has performed well as a key partner in the Bush administration's War on Terror. But as Rowan Scarborough reveals in this groundbreaking new book, significant elements within the CIA are undermining both the president and national security through leaks, false allegations, and outright sabotage.Using his first-rate sources in all levels of national security--from field officers to high-ranking analysts to former intelligence heads--Scarborough paints a disturbing picture of partisan politics endangering the success of our campaigns abroad and the very lives of our soldiers and agents.In Sabotage, you'll learn:* How CIA analysts repeatedly leak details about classified intelligence programs with the dual intent of ending them and damaging the president* How, on at least eight occasions, intelligence officials have made serious allegations of wrongdoing against the president's men--which turned out to be false* Why, contrary to popular belief, the CIA has become predominantly liberal* How a CIA turf battle prevented special operators from pursuing and capturing a notorious Taliban leader* How current and former CIA officers fueled conspiracy theories that President Bush orchestrated the 9/11 attacks on America* How a CIA leak to the New York Times deprived the U.S. of critical information in the War on Terror* How press leaks by the CIA have damaged relations with our foreign allies in the War on Terror* How a CIA analyst worked with Democrats to sabotage the nomination of John Bolton to the UN* How Clinton's downsizing of the CIA led to the closing of stations in scores of jihadist breeding grounds--including Hamburg, Germany, where the 9/11 plot was hatchedThe CIA's job is to collect facts and let the White House, the Pentagon, and the State Department make national security policy. But, as Scarborough conclusively demonstrates, an agency that is supposed to be scrupulously nonpartisan has become increasingly political--during a time of war--against America's elected commander in chief.",

Vividly anecdotal and brilliantly original.Perhaps the most important study of the city ever written, London confirms Ackroyd\u2019s status as what one critic called, \u201cour age\u2019s greatest London imagination.\u201d Much of Peter Ackroyd\u2019s work has been concerned with the life and past of London, but this new book is his definitive account of the city. For Ackroyd\u2019s London is a living organism, with its own laws of growth and change, so London is The Biography , as the book is subtitled, not a History. Here Ackroyd portrays London from the time of the Druids to the beginning of the twenty-first century, noting magnificence in each age. But this is not a simple chronological record.He writes chapters on the history of silence, the history of light, the history of childhood, the history of Cockney speech, and the history of drink. He constructs a comprehensive, multilayered image of the place, animated by his concern for the close relationship between the present and the past, and the peculiar \u2018echoic\u2019 quality of London which actively affects the lives and personalities of its citizens.",

InJust Beyond Tomorrow, Jasmine's strong-willed son, Patrick Leslie, continues Skye's Legacy when he takes a wife who wants no husband. . .Just Beyond TomorrowWith his father dead and his mother in France, Patrick Leslie, Duke of Glenkirk, discovers the obligations of the estate and its people are now his alone. But during a day of hunting, a chance meeting ensures that he will not be alone much longer, for to obtain the deserted castle and lands adjoining his, Patrick must agree to take something else, as well--a bride.Flanna Brodie, heiress to Brae, is as vibrant and beautiful as the Scottish countryside, and just as wild. She wants no man--only her freedom. But the passions Patrick awakens in her run deeper than those of the flesh. The independent Flanna is determined to champion the royal Stuarts' cause, and restore Charles II to his throne despite her husband's objections. Patrick knows the dangers of such political intrigues; that the Stuarts have always brought misfortune to the Leslies of Glenkirk, and that a roguish king will ask far more of the na\u00efve duchess than a simple vow of fealty--forcing Patrick and Flanna to choose between the threat of wounded pride, and the promise of a lasting love both secretly yearn for. . .",

His breaking of the German U-boat Enigma cipher in World War II ensured Allied-American control of the Atlantic. But Turing's vision went far beyond the desperate wartime struggle. Already in the 1930s he had defined the concept of the universal machine, which underpins the computer revolution. In 1945 he was a pioneer of electronic computer design. But Turing's true goal was the scientific understanding of the mind, brought out in the drama and wit of the famous \"Turing test\" for machine intelligence and in his prophecy for the twenty-first century.",
