Her latest case begins in the middle of a summer night when she is called away from a very personal visit to her investigator Paul van Wagoner's hotel room to meet with a desperate new client at her office who gives her name as Jessie Potter. The frightened young woman has just hit a huge slot machine jackpot, and the men in suits are waiting to hand her the check just as soon as she tells them her real identity.With time running out, Nina helps her client devise a brilliant plan to collect the money while keeping her true identity a secret. Unfortunately, powerful interests have lined up to grab the money. The gaming commission thinks the jackpot was rigged. The man sitting on the seat just before the jackpot hit says it's his, and he doesn't mind going outside the law to get it. And the wealthy man stalking Nina's client has retained an unscrupulous local lawyer, Jeff Riesner, to attack the jackpot winnings using a legal maneuver called a Writ of Execution. The odds of Jessie ever collecting are starting to look hopeless.For Nina, what began as a fight for an underdog in federal court soon escalates into something very different and far more dangerous. Jessie has a secret, and she needs that money for a very good reason. By the time Nina discovers that Jessie is withholding vital information, it might be too late for her client and even for Nina herself. Because somewhere in the darkening Tahoe night, people are dying. A cold-blooded, obsessed killer will stop at nothing - including execution-style murder - to get that jackpot in a case where the Writ of Execution has become more than a legal maneuver; it's death warrant.",

Now the author of Safe Harbor, True Blue, and other New York Times bestsellers presents the gripping story of a man fighting for his family, a woman searching for her sister--and the promise of a new life where both least expected it...The Secret HourBeneath his careful and controlled demeanor, attorney John O\u2019Rourke is a man whose life is in turmoil. Since the death of his wife, he has been juggling the rigors of a controversial capital murder case and the demands of raising two children. Eleven-year-old Maggie\u2019s crooked bangs and rumpled clothes eloquently reproach John\u2019s earnest but haphazard attempts at mothering. Teddy, John\u2019s stalwart fourteen-year-old, has quietly assumed responsibilities far too weighty for his young shoulders, as he longs for the way things used to be and tries to ignore the hostility that has swirled around his family since his father took on the defense of a killer whose crimes have rocked Connecticut.A brick through the window one autumn morning signals a dangerous new level of hatred. But a quieter event also takes place that day.  A woman arrives on the O\u2019Rourke doorstep to find a household on the brink of chaos but brimming with love--and, she hopes, answers.

Rick Rodgers, author of the \u201c101\u201d cookbook series  (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Barbecues) and many other cookbooks, presents more than 150 recipes that busy home cooks will love, both for their ease and their flavor.Many home cooks\u2019 palates have reached lofty levels of sophistication, but the amount of time and energy available for cooking has plummeted. With that in mind, Rick Rodgers has come up with a brilliant solution.In his most comprehensive book to date, Rodgers replaces stress and fuss with creativity and ease. While Rodgers has included numerous quick ideas in this collection, he believes \u201cslow food\u201d has a place in the kitchen of the busiest home cook, so many of his selections simmer and roast at a leisurely pace while the cook does something else\u2014or nothing at all. Written in Rodgers\u2019s appealingly irreverent style, each of the 150 recipes in The Carefree Cook draws dazzling flavor from just a handful of ingredients. What\u2019s for dinner? Rodgers has compiled an enticing array of entr\u00e9es, including meat, fish, chicken, pasta, and vegetarian dishes: Pork Tenderloin with Lime Butter Sauce, Halibut with Herbed Oil, Grilled Five-Spice Chicken, Bucatini Carbonara with Zucchini, and Santa Fe Corn Pudding, to name just a few. Soups, salads, and hot and hearty main-dish sandwiches (Potato and Roasted Red Pepper Soup, Carrot Slaw with Miso Vinaigrette,  Bistro Skirt Steak Sandwich) can be mixed and matched for satisfying suppers. To make life even easier he supplies what he calls \u201cbonus recipes.\u201d These are based on making larger quantities of a dish that can serve as the basis for future meals. Thus a meat stew can turn up as a pasta sauce later in the week with the addition of crushed tomatoes and some extra simmering, or a large roast chicken can be the basis of a chicken casserole the following night. He also provides the easiest and best recipes for sweets he has collected over the years, including Rocky Road Chocolate Cake, \u201cFaux\u201d Peach Tarte Tatin, and Banana Streusel Coffee Cake. Every recipe is conveyed in the realistic, detailed format that has won Rodgers so many fans.A down-to-earth approach to fine cooking, The Carefree Cook will give even the most inexperienced novice in the kitchen the confidence to cook well and have a good time doing it.",

        "Description": "Inspiration, understanding, comfort, revelation, spiritual guidance - a huge audience of devoted readers seeks all of this in the words of Pope John Paul II. The astonishing success of Crossing the Threshold of Hope (even despite the difficulty of that text) has left readers hungry for the words of the Pope, not altered or watered down, but made accessible by careful selection and organization. In The Wisdom of John Paul II, readers will find the sustenance they seek. Culled from the Pope's encyclicals, apostolic letters, addresses, occasional speeches, and other writings, The Wisdom of John Paul II is a powerful and illuminating distillation of the Pope's most moving, wise, and penetrating statements on the issues that concern us most.Organized into easy-to-read categories, Pope John Paul's fresh and inspiring words address a range of important issues - spirituality in modern life, human rights and religious freedom, marriage and family, morality, peace, prayer, women's roles, poverty, and many other concerns vital to Christian life and thought. A beacon of light for Catholics and non-Catholics alike, The Wisdom of John Paul II fulfills the promise of Crossing the Threshold by offering readers direct access to the bold and noble thoughts of the premier spiritual leader of our time.",

        "Description": "As Lincoln led the nation into the Civil War, managing the Union war effort, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, winning reelection in 1864, and planning the Reconstruction of the South, he also led a private life, defined by his close relationship with his wife and his devotion to his children. Lincoln at Home offers a view into the life of the family through their written correspondence.  With a brief account of their years in the White House and the complete collection of all the known letters exchanged by Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, this elegant portrait defines the sixteenth president as a dedicated -- though often a desperately busy and distracted -- family man.  Lincoln at Home is an intimate and rare glimpse of the president as husband and father, a cheerful man pinned to the floor while playing with his children, and a desolate man struck down by grief at the death of his son. Beyond this, we are shown a personal side of the man who managed one of the most difficult periods in American history.",

        "Authors": "By Bull, Chris and Gallagher, John",
        "Description": "A political war is raging in the United States between two groups once considered radical, even marginal, by most Americans: the religious right and the gay movement. Perfect Enemies reveals why this conflict has moved to the center of political debate and become a pivotal issue in elections at all levels.In Perfect Enemies, Chris Bull and John Gallagher trace the origins and growth of both groups from the seminal year of 1969, when the Stonewall Riots ushered in the modern gay rights movement and when Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell embarked on direct political action to bring strict biblical interpretation to bear on public policy. The skillful grassroots organizational efforts of both movements, based on a mutual demonization of each side by the other, resulted in growing political clout that developed under the radar of mainstream political commentators - and exploded upon the scene in a series of bitter and, to most Americans, bewildering political conflicts.From President Clinton's aborted pledge to lift the ban on gays and lesbians in the armed forces to the statewide antigay initiatives in Oregon, Colorado, and Maine, Bull and Gallagher offer the first comprehensive account of the rhetoric and strategies - often remarkably alike - of both sides, and of how the mutual passion of these perfect enemies is influencing electoral politics from the state houses to the White House.",
