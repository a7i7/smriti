In Clearing the Way teachers will find specific ideas and strategies, a workable philosophy for teaching writing, and, best of all, vivid stories and case histories of real teenagers.   Romano discusses the importance of respecting students' words, the use of writing to learn and discover, the teacher-student conference, writing processes in theory and practice, the evaluation and grading of writing, the place of writing in literature classes, and the powerful creative current that can be transmitted among teenage writers. Whatever the topic, Romano illustrates his ideas with many examples of teenagers' own writing.",

Stark, skillfully woven, this fascinating novel explores the curious turnings of human character through the strange case of Dr. Jekyll, a kindly scientist who by night takes on his stunted evil self, Mr. Hyde. Anticipating modern psychology, Jekyll And Hyde is a brilliantly original study of man's dual nature\u2014as well as an immortal tale of suspense and terror. Published in 1866, Jekyll And Hyde was an instant success and brought Stevenson his first taste of fame. Though sometimes dismissed as a mere mystery story, the book has evoked much literary admirations. Vladimir Nabokov likened it to Madame Bovary and Dead Souls as \"a fable that lies nearer to poetry than to ordinary prose fiction.\"",

We spend most of our lives worried about what we don\u2019t do instead of what we have done, focused on our imperfections instead of God\u2019s fondness for the imperfect. Why? Because we\u2019ve been bombarded with books, tapes, talks, seminars, and movies convincing us that real Christianity is all about perfection.Michael Yaconelli dares to suggest that imperfection, unfinishedness, and messiness are, in fact, the earmarks of true Christianity; that real Christianity is messy, erratic, lopsided . . . and gloriously liberating.  What if genuine faith begins with admitting we will never have our act completely together? Maybe messy disciples are exactly the kind of imperfect people Jesus came to earth for and whose company he actually enjoyed--and still enjoys. If you want to find Jesus today, look for him in the midst of burned-out believers, moral misfits, religious incompetents . . . men and women whose lives are, well, messy. Messy Spirituality is a strong antidote for the spiritual perfectionism in us all. Here are truths that can cut you loose from the tyranny of ought-to\u2019s and open your eyes to the deep spirituality of being loved, shortcomings and all, by the God who meets you and transforms you in the midst of a messy and unpredictable life.",

        "Authors": "By Rosen, Laura Epstein and Amador, Xavier F.",
        "Description": "Although numerous books have been written for those suffering from depression, until now none of them has addressed the \"secondary\" victims of this debilitating disease: the loved ones of the depressed. If someone you love is depressed, you undoubtedly recognize that the depression has placed some new burdens on you; however you may be affected in more ways than you realize. Research shows that if you are close to a depressed person, you are at a much higher risk of developing problems yourself, including anxiety, phobias, and even a kind of contagious depression. Yet, too often, those of us who care about a depressed person are so focused on their needs that we don't realize that we might need help. There is startling evidence that marriages in which one person is depressed are nine times more likely to end in divorce; that children with a depressed parent are at an increased risk for a range of adjustment difficulties; and that if you are caring for an elderly depressed parent, your physical and mental health are likely to suffer.Depression is also notorious for causing increased misunderstandings and sexual problems in intimate relationships. Laura Rosen and Xavier Amador, psychologists with expertise in treating the secondary victims of depression, explain the mechanisms of depression that can cause communication breakdown, increase hostility, and ultimately destroy relationships. Rather than just explaining these secondary effects of depression, the authors teach you concrete methods that you and your loved one can use to protect yourselves and your relationship from depression's impact.",

This collection of five one-act plays \u2014 in the celebrated Constance Garnett translations \u2014 shows Chekhov at his witty best.The Anniversary takes a lively look behind the frenetic scenes at a bank: a man overburdened with errands from friends and family gives a nearly maddened but ludicrous account of his chores and obligations in An Unwilling Martyr; and The Wedding depicts scenes from a wedding reception in which the mother of the bride assumes affected airs and deals with quarrelsome guests. In The Bear, a virtuous, spirited widow is pressed to repay a debt and ends up receiving an offer of marriage. The Proposal depicts the trauma of a would-be suitor who winds up in a wrangle over property.Theater lovers, students of drama and literature, and other readers, as well as amateur and professional groups performing these popular works, will welcome this convenient, inexpensive collection of comic gems by one of the masters of modern drama.",

On his first day, he rises to national prominence by cutting his own office budget by $400,000. Discovering enormous waste and corruption all around him, he becomes an agent provocateur against special interests and business-as-usual politics - which gains him the enmity of the leaders of both his own party and that of the opposition.To many of the powerbrokers, he is simply a loose cannon with no money, no influence, no power. Some see him as an opportunistic troublemaker. But those who underestimate Charlie Palmer learn that they are making a serious mistake.He gives them reason to fear as he contests the party's nominee for Vice President at the national convention. Realizing that Palmer is a Washington rarity - a man without pretension or guile who will not \"go along\" with the status quo - the powers-that-be close ranks against him.But, as a hero of the disenchanted, Charlie Palmer becomes the most popular politician of the age. A groundswell erupts, supporting him for an independent run for the White House. To the Washington Establishment, this makes him a very dangerous man.Across party lines and behind closed doors, the crooked politicians, the hired consultants, the lavish-spending lobbyists and representatives of foreign corporations join forces to stop Palmer. Using every resource at their disposal - uncovering painful secrets in his past, blackmail, even murder - they try to discredit him in the eyes of the public, hoping to block him from taking the White House in the most exciting and unprecedented election in the nation's history.",

There are prayers for couples, for parents, and for children; prayers to mend broken relationships and prayers to overcome obsessive and compulsive love. There are prayers to heal the soul, prayers to heal the body, and prayers for work and creativity.Williamson also gives us prayers for the healing of America, including two prayers that have had powerful effects on audiences at her lectures: a prayer of amends on behalf of European Americans to African-Americans and one to Native Americans. How, Williamson asks, can we expect anyone to forgive when we have made no formal apology?Another section includes rites of passage, ceremonies of light for the signal events in our lives: blessing of the newborn, coming of age, marriage, and death. There is also a ceremony of the elder, for moving into midlife, and a ceremony of divorce, in which a gentle transition is provided for both the couple and their children.\"Read my prayers or someone else's,\" Williamson says. \"By all means, create your own.\" Illuminata is a way to bring prayer into practical use, creating a sweeter, more abundant life for yourself and the people you care for. \"No conventional therapy,\" she says, \"can release us from a deep and abiding psychic pain. Through prayer we find what we cannot find elsewhere: a peace that is not of this world.\"",

        "Description": "You can never really retire from the Agency. Charles Avenue Henderson, who now runs a pricey bed-and-breakfast in West Virginia and spends his days hiking trails, not following them, is about to be reminded of that salient fact more vividly than he'd like.All he really wants is a little recognition for his covert work on the Kennedy assassination with his cold-war buddy Bruce Conn Clark, a powerful Washington consultant and distinguished elder statesman. But it's not so simple, as he learns one morning when his hotel room in D.C. is bombed just as he's going out to buy the paper. In fact, Charlie's quiet, uncomplicated life turns terrifying faster than he could have imagined; the next day someone severs the brake line in his car. Forced to scrape the rust off spook skills he hasn't used in years, he begins to investigate and finds that all the signs point to Bruce Conn Clark. But why would the former secretary of state want Charlie dead?As the investigation deepens and the stakes grow higher, Bruce and Charlie discover that while decades-old promises and secrets could destroy them, they might also give them back their youth. The ensuing game of spy versus spy may be their toughest yet.Blue Hearts is filled with characters from real life, such as James Jesus Angleton, John McCone, and Alexander Gannady Petrov, and other spies and public figures both real and imagined. It's also replete with Washington gossip and tidbits that only a writer with sources inside Langley could provide. Blue Hearts is as thrilling a ride through the assassination conspiracies, cold-war battles, and covert operations of the last thirty years as any spy-novel aficionado could hope to find.",
