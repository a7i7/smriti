Her departure confounds her family and neighbors: Adele is beautiful; she is lucky; she possesses charisma; she is a champion swimmer whose stamina and grace astound the patrons of the exclusive resort in the Caribbean that her family visits each year. Adele's husband cannot understand what the Indian guru - an elusive, ever-changing man who indeed seems privy to some of life's mysteries - can give Adele that he cannot. Her two children worry as she grows gaunt and begins to look older than her years, and as her letters arrive less and less frequently. As we watch Adele's deepening spirituality,\u00a0The Woman Who Walked on Water\u00a0compellingly gives life to the writings of Rumi, Laotzu, and the Upanishads, which infuse this work with their wisdom. Yet what also emerges is a troubling portrait of a woman alone in a foreign country, surrounded by a family and culture not her own, in a dry and dusty city. Lily Tuck portrays with acumen, pathos, and humor a woman who may have found enlightenment. She also leaves us questioning Adele's fate, and our own desires for transcendence.",

And Donna Jean Morgan finds herself married to a Bible-thumping bigamist who has the nerve to die in circumstances that implicate his wife. A. P. does her damnedest for Eleanor, an abused wife in denial, and Bill gallantly defends Donna Jean. Meanwhile, Elizabeth's forensic expertise, including her special knowledge of poisons, gives her the most challenging case of her career.As questions of wife abuse and abandonment emerge in the court of public opinion, Elizabeth becomes a war correspondent in the battle of the sexes - a battle as old as the hills and unlikely to reach a truce any time soon....",

There's Skorka, model by profession, homewrecker by vocation; Jenn, willing to cross county lines for true love; Danielle, recently divorced, seducer of at least one father/son combo in her quest to make up for perceived \"missed opportunities.\"When Ruby falls for her boss, Michael, all bets are off.

It also presents a practical, proven model for achieving such transformation, and illustrates the process with three extended case studies and numerous additional examples of the model in action.To create high-performing teams, the authors say, we must first acknowledge that teamwork doesn't come naturally. While individuals and organizations are trained to pay lip service to the value of working together, this approach actually clashes with cultures that reward \"looking out for number 1.\" Add in the turf battles that still smolder in most workplaces - especially in companies that have recently merged or downsized - and teams can become powder kegs.Yet, as the book's examples reveal, teaming is a vital way to structure work and meet today's business challenges. Whether your organization is fine-tuning its team efforts or just starting out, Corporate Culture/Team Culture shows you how to succeed by tackling cultural issues from the ground up.",

        "Authors": "By Gilbert, Michael",
        "Description": "The law has captured the public's attention and imagination for centuries, with its servants demonstrating time and again their fallibility.  A former lawyer and celebrated crime writer, Michael Gilbert has compiled a vastly entertaining collection of over three hundred fifty anecdotes about legal goings-on over the past two hundred fifty years, and about the individuals who have won distinction in the legal profession. Drawn from the reminiscences of lawyers, criminals, witnesses, and clerks, these irresistibly readable stories present the foibles as well as the authority of judges and other legal practitioners.     We find many celebrated legal battles retold here, including Edward Carson's cross-examination of Oscar Wilde and Clarence Darrow's defense of J.T. Scopes for teaching the theory of evolution.  We also discover countless less-familiar treasures such as the story of the letter received by Judge Benjamin Cardozo which said: \"I read in the newspapers that you are a liberal judge. Will you send me ten dollars as I'm really very hard up.\"      Gilbert has arranged the entries alphabetically by the name of their principal subject.  He also includes headnotes which set the context and describe each subject's occupation (i.e. \"judge\", \"attorney general\") and a useful note which explains the differences between the British, European, and American legal systems.",

As a bond trader at a small but formidable London financial house, Paul is apprenticed to Hamilton McKenzie, a coldly brilliant trader who has made it his business to expand the international scope of the company. Paul feels as though he has found a professional home, and even begins to fall in love with his bold, irreverently funny colleague, Debbie Chater.On the night Debbie's body is dragged from the murky waters of the Thames, Paul begins a progressive and chaotic tumble into a darker world of trading . . . where there is more to lose than just market position. In sorting through Debbie's papers, Paul discovers suspicious details involving an investment in a shell company in the Netherlands Antilles. Setting out to discover more about this deal and Debbie's death, he turns up a rogues' gallery of nasties - a psychopathic bond trader, a shady international entrepreneur, and an unscrupulous salesman - none of whom would think twice about killing off a young, too inquisitive woman who is in over her head and in their way.The more Paul probes into Debbie's death and the ever more suspicious circumstances surrounding it, the more inexorably he becomes caught up in a web of international chicanery that could end up costing him more than just his career.",

Anyone who is around young children will find useful information on how humans create speech and language.\"--The Bloomsbury ReviewChildren learn to make sense of the babble around them and become coherent speakers and incipient readers in just five or six years. In this remarkable book, linguist Naomi Baron takes us on a journey through language, showing the variety of ways in which children crack the language code and master the means of expression, and how parents play a vital role in the process. Every parent will see something of his or her child in the numerous and vivid examples; those whose kids don't fit preconceived norms will find reassurance and guidance in these pages. Spiced with enchanting examples of children putting their first words together, struggling to understand meaning, and coming to use language as a creative tool, Growing Up with Language reminds us that underneath all their efforts is the drive to make sense of the world.",

        "Authors": "By Doctorow, E. L.",
        "Description": "One rainy morning in 1871 young Martin Pemberton, walking down Broadway in lower Manhattan, sees in a passing horse-drawn omnibus several old men in black, one of whom he recognizes as his supposedly dead and buried father. So begins E. L. Doctorow's astounding new novel of post-Civil War New York, where maimed veterans beg in the streets, newsboys fight for their corners, the Tweed Ring operates the city for its own profit, and a conspicuously self-satisfied class of new wealth and weak intellect is all a glitter in a setting of mass misery.As Pemberton tries in vain to track the strange omnibus of old men, he leads us into a city we know and recognize and yet don't know, a ghost city that stands to contemporary New York like a panoramic negative print, reversed in its lights and shadows, its seasons turned round. The increasingly ominous tale is narrated by Pemberton's sometime employer, McIlvaine, the editor of the newspaper for which the young man writes occasional reviews. When Pemberton himself disappears, McIlvaine goes in pursuit of the truth of his freelance's bizarre fate. Layer by layer, he reveals to us a New York more deadly, more creative, more of a genius society than it is now. New technologies transport water to its reservoirs and gaslight to its streetlamps. Locomotives thunder down its streets. Telegraphy sings in its overhead wires, and its high-speed printing presses turn out tens of thousands of newspapers for a penny or two. It is a proudly, heedlessly modern city, and yet...the scene of ancient, primordial urges and transgressions, a companion city of our dreams...a moral hologram generated from this celebrated author's electrifying historical imagination.The Waterworks is a haunting tale of genius and madness in a metropolis that is itself a product of these qualities. Masterfully written and promising to be unforgettable, it is a triumphant addition to E. L. Doctorow's remarkable body of work.",

It keeps the homeless away at night and lovingly tends the tree that reaches up through its beautiful atrium. Dubbed the Gridiron, the Yu Building is the culmination of art and function. It's also something else: a serial killer.Something has gone wrong inside the immensely powerful brain of this corporate dream palace. Before the building is opened to the public, one member of a team of brilliant computer programmers dies slumped against his VDT, his eyes burned black. Then a security guard is found with his skull shattered. Now the men and women who know the building best - including its egomaniacal architect and the one person who may actually be able to reason with the computer - know that the building itself is spinning wildly out of control.Built to survive power outages and the most massive earthquakes, the brain of the Gridiron cannot be unplugged and cannot be outsmarted. For the dozen people who are locked inside, the Gridiron is turning into a living, malevolent dungeon of terrors, where each death is more horrific than the one before, and human survival may be the ultimate achievement...",

The wisdom so pure. And the concepts as familiar as they are obvious. Stephen Michael Peter Thomas is one of the rare thinkers who can make timeless half-truths sound refreshingly new. (Or maybe it's just that he charges so much that clients have deluded themselves to believe that he is really onto something!)

Competition. Strategy. Wardrobe. Stephen Michael Peter Thomas tackles each topic one by one. And The Book That's Sweeping America! comes with a bona fide guarantee--not a single idea is new or different enough to challenge or make you feel uncomfortable. Competing in business is tough enough these days without having to worry about tackling new material. * Fascinating case stories and interviews from the world's most successful organizations (like all business books there will most likely be cases from Xerox) * Eye-catching photos, charts, and graphics that make even the most obvious ideas easy to grasp * Learning summaries, Q&As, and exercises to implement in the odd chance that something new or original strikes you STEPHEN MICHAEL PETER THOMAS (The Sphere of Influence, USA) describes himself as \"the most talked about and influential business consultant the world has ever seen.\" The confidante of CEOs and the darling of the academic set, he is never referred to as \"Steve.\"",

        "Title": "Visions of the Future: The Distant Past, Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow",
        "Authors": "By Heilbroner, Robert",
        "Description": "\"This is an exceedingly long short book, stretching at least fifty thousand years into the past and who knows how many into the future...\" So begins Visions of the Future, the prophetic new book by eminent economist Robert Heilbroner. Heilbroner's basic premise is stunning in its elegant simplicity. He contends that throughout all of human history, despite the huge gulf in social organization, technological development and cultural achievement that divides us from the earliest known traces of homo sapiens, there have really only been three distinct ways of looking at the future. During a period Heilbroner refers to simply as the Distant Past, stretching from prehistory to the appearance of modern nation-states in seventeenth century Europe, there was no notion of a future measurably and materially different from the present or the past. From the Stone Age to the Bronze, Mesopotamia and Egypt to Greece and Rome, and throughout the Middle Ages, a continuum of cultures and civilizations shared one defining characteristic, and that was the absence of any expectation of material progress for the great masses of people. Heilbroner maintains that it was not until the first stirrings of the period he refers to as Yesterday, spanning from roughly 1700 to 1950, that the future entered into human consciousness as a great beckoning force. Capitalism, continually reinvigorated by the seemingly endless forward march of science and an evolving sense of democracy, appeared to promise all levels of society some expectation of a future at least somewhat better than the past. It was this unwavering faith in the superiority of the future that separated Yesterday from the age we have now entered. While we are still driven towards tomorrow by the same forces that determined the recent past, the lessons of Hiroshima and Chernobyl, the chaos in the former Soviet Union, the stagnation of the West, and the anarchic rage unleashed in our inner cities and in hot spots around the globe have brought on a palpable anxiety that is quite apart from both the resignation of the Distant Past or the bright optimism of Yesterday.   In a brilliant conclusion drawing together the threat of nuclear blackmail, global warning and the growing commodification of life represented by video games, voice mail, and VCRs, Visions of the Future issues a clarion call to face the challenges of the twenty-first century with a new awareness and resolve, a resolve strengthened by the inspiration of our collective past.",

I washed on a normal basis and still had good credit.\u201d Introducing Laurie Notaro,  the leader of the Idiot Girls\u2019 Action-Adventure Club. Every day she fearlessly rises  from bed to defeat the evil machinations of dolts, dimwits, and creepy boyfriends\u2014and  that\u2019s before she even puts on a bra. For the past ten years, Notaro has been entertaining  Phoenix newspaper readers with her wildly amusing autobiographical exploits and unique  life experiences. She writes about a world of hourly-wage jobs that require absolutely  no skills, a mother who hands down judgments more forcefully than anyone seated on  the Supreme Court, horrific high school reunions, and hangovers that leave her surprised  that she woke up in the first place. The misadventures of Laurie and her fellow  Idiot Girls (\u201ctoo cool to be in the Smart Group\u201d) unfold in a world that everyone  will recognize but no one has ever described so hilariously. She delivers the goods:  life as we all know it.",
