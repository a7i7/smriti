        "Authors": "By Allen, John L.",
        "Description": "From the author of Conclave and All the Pope\u2019s Men comes the story of Pope John Paul II\u2019s last days, the behind-the-scenes dynamics within the College of Cardinals that led to the choice of Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI, and where the new pope is likely to lead the Catholic Church.  On April 18, 2005, the College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church gathered to elect a successor to Pope John Paul II. Faced with several potential candidates, the cardinals made a bold choice, entrusting the Keys of the Kingdom to 78-year-old Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany, a man whose views on the challenges facing the Church and the broader culture could not be more unambiguous, or controversial. Questions arose as the world watched while Ratzinger was installed as Pope Benedict XVI, the 266th pontiff of the Catholic Church. Why Ratzinger? Why someone so clearly identified with the previous pope? Why not a \u201ccompromise\u201d choice? Why a Cardinal from Western Europe and not from Africa or Latin America? What would this mean for the future of the Catholic Church? No one can tell the story of exactly what took place during the closed doors meeting, known as the conclave, when Cardinals from around the world cast their votes for the next pope, better than John L. Allen, Jr. As a correspondent for National Catholic Reporter and a Vatican analyst for CNN and National Public Radio, Allen has spent years covering Vatican politics and personalities, and his unique access to Roman halls of power has enabled him to write the ultimate behind-the-scenes account of the election of Pope Benedict XVI. The Rise of Benedict XVI is based on extensive research and exclusive interviews with eight cardinals representing five nationalities, guaranteeing readers an intimate glimpse into this monumental decision.But Allen\u2019s insight also means that he is in a unique position to evaluate the accomplishments and legacy of the man now known as Pope Benedict XVI, and to provide some analysis of the direction he will take the Catholic Church in the coming years. Ratzinger\u2019s long career as a major Vatican insider, force of influence, and occasionally polarizing figure, has ensured that his pontificate will be one of the most fascinating in the history of the Catholic Church. Benedict XVI will certainly have a major impact on the lives of the faithful around the world, and John Allen\u2019s riveting new book is the definitive work on this turning point in history.",

I give it now to my children and grandchildren, and to yours, so they will always know what it was like in America when people were free.\"Since the publication of her bestselling memoir, Going Rogue, in 2009, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin has traveled the country extensively. She has visited cities and towns in almost every state, dropped in on military bases, given talks and speeches to small groups and at massive rallies. Throughout her travels, she has been privileged to meet thousands of Americans---ordinary men and women who have shared with her their hopes and dreams, their love of country, and their fears about what lies ahead. Governor Palin, inspired by these encounters, celebrates in her new book the enduring strengths and virtues that have made this country a beacon of liberty and hope for the rest of the world.America by Heart is a highly personal testament to her deep love of country, her strong roots in faith, and her profound appreciation of family. Ranging widely over American history, culture, and current affairs, Governor Palin reflects on the key values that have been such an essential part of her own life and that continue to inform her vision of America's future. The book also includes brief readings from classic and contemporary texts that have moved and inspired her, as well as portraits of Americans, both famous and obscure, whom she admires.Informed by Palin's own principles and deepest feelings, graced with intimate memories, this remarkable book gives us a close-up view of an extraordinary woman who is not afraid to speak out and defend the American values in which she so deeply believes.",

And it's probably becauseZits is the best depiction of life with a teenager since, well, ever!Pimp My Lunch: Zits Sketchbook No. 10Zits chronicles the daily lives of a teen in a way that's not done in the popular media-with respect. \"Having teenagers in the house is like having a front-row seat to one of life's great passages,\" says Jim Borgman. \"Zits tries to respect that period by taking a sympathetic view of all the players involved-the parents, as well as the kids.\"We like to think of Zits as the antidote to all of the bad stuff you read about teenagers today,\" adds Jerry Scott. \"Many people believe that modern adolescence is all about gangs, guns, drugs\" etc.Zits gives a different view of the teenage experience \"where, for most kids, relationships, friendships, school, and sports are the stuff of daily life.Zits levels the playing field and often causes (gasp!) communication to occur between kids and their parents. Appearing in over 1,200 newspapers worldwide, this enormously popular comic strip has been a staple since it was first syndicated in 1997.",

        "Title": "One Big Table: One Big Table",
        "Authors": "By O'Neill, Molly",
        "Description": "From noted food writer Molly O\u2019Neill comes a lavish portrait of our nation\u2019s contemporary culinary tradition with the best recipes from the greatest home cooks.Ten years ago, former New York Times food columnist Molly O\u2019Neill embarked on a transcontinental road trip to investigate reports that Americans had stopped cooking at home. As she traveled highways, dirt roads, bayous, and coastlines gathering stories and recipes, it was immediately apparent that dire predictions about the end of American cuisine were vastly overstated. From Park Avenue to trailer parks, from tidy suburbs to isolated outposts, home cooks were channeling their family histories as well as their tastes and personal ambitions into delicious meals. One decade and over 300,000 miles later, One Big Table is a celebration of these cooks, a mouthwatering portrait of the nation at the table. Meticulously selected from more than 20,000 contributions, the cookbook\u2019s 600 recipes are a definitive portrait of what we eat and why. In this lavish volume\u2014illustrated throughout with historic photographs, folk art, vintage advertisements, and family snapshots\u2014O\u2019Neill celebrates heirloom recipes like the Doughty family\u2019s old-fashioned black duck and dumplings that originated on a long-vanished island off Virginia\u2019s Eastern Shore, the Pueblo tamales that Norma Naranjo makes in her horno in New Mexico, as well as modern riffs such as a Boston teenager\u2019s recipe for asparagus soup scented with nigella seeds and truffle oil. Many recipes offer a bridge between first-generation immigrants and their progeny\u2014the bucatini with dandelion greens and spring garlic that an Italian immigrant and his grandson forage for in the Vermont woods\u2014while others are contemporary variations that embody each generation\u2019s restless obsession with distinguishing itself from its predecessors. O\u2019Neill cooks with artists, writers, doctors, truck drivers, food bloggers, scallop divers, horse trainers, potluckers, and gourmet club members. In a world where takeout is just a phone call away, One Big Table reminds us of the importance of remaining connected to the food we put on our tables. As this brilliantly edited collection shows on every page, the glories of a home-cooked meal prove how every generation has enriched and expanded our idea of American food. Every recipe in this book is a testament to the way our memories\u2014historical, cultural, and personal\u2014are bound up in our favorite and best family dishes. As O\u2019Neill writes, \u201cMost Americans cook from the heart as well as from a distinctly American yearning, something I could feel but couldn\u2019t describe until thousands of miles of highway helped me identify it in myself: hometown appetite. This book is a journey through hundreds of \u2018hometowns\u2019 that fuel the American appetite, recipe by recipe, bite by bite.\u201d",

        "Description": "The compelling and insightful account of a New York Times reporter's abduction by the Taliban, and his wife's struggle to free him.  Invited to an interview by a Taliban commander, New York Times reporter David Rohde and two Afghan colleagues were kidnapped in November 2008 and spirited to the tribal areas of Pakistan. For the next seven months, they lived in an alternate reality, ruled by jihadists, in which paranoia, conspiracy theories, and shifting alliances abounded. Held in bustling towns, they found that Pakistan's powerful military turned a blind eye to a sprawling Taliban ministate that trained suicide bombers, plotted terrorist attacks, and helped shelter Osama bin Laden. In New York, David's wife of two months, Kristen Mulvihill, his family, and The New York Times struggled to navigate the labyrinth of issues that confront the relatives of hostages. Their methodical, Western approach made little impact on the complex mix of cruelty, irrationality, and criminality that characterizes the militant Islam espoused by David's captors. In the end, a stolen piece of rope and a prayer ended the captivity. The experience tested and strengthened Mulvihill and Rohde's relationship and exposed the failures of American effort in the region. The tale of those seven months is at once a love story and a reflection of the great cultural divide-and challenge-of our time.",

Worth has come to Nebraska from New York City on the Orphan Train, which brings homeless children west to find new lives.  Nathaniel feels increasingly jealous of the boy who has taken over not only his work but the attention of his father, who has barely spoken to him since his injury. In school for the first time he is far behind even his youngest classmates, and he feels as useless there as he does at home.  Meanwhile, Worth is still grieving for his family and his old life. As the farm chores prevent him from going to school, he also resents losing his dream of an education and a good job. And for all the work he does, he knows he will never inherit the farm that he's helping to save.  But a battle between ranchers and farmers -- and a book of Greek mythology that Nathaniel reads aloud each evening -- forges a connection between the two boys, who begin to discover that maybe there is enough room on the farm, and in the family, for both of them.  A. LaFaye's dynamic portrayal of two boys longing for something they no longer have -- and finding the resources to face the future -- offers a fresh perspective on the thousands of children who moved west via the Orphan Trains in the late nineteenth century.",

There the lives of the two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of the guillotine.  GREAT EXPECTATIONS  A terrifying encounter with an escaped convict in a graveyard on the wild Kent marshes; a summons to meet the bitter, decaying Miss Havisham and her beautiful, cold-hearted ward Estella; the sudden generosity of a mysterious benefactor- these form a series of events that changes the orphaned Pip's life forever, and he eagerly abandons his humble origins to begin a new life as a gentleman. Dickens's haunting late novel depicts Pip's education and development through adversity as he discovers the true nature of his \"great expectations.\"  This deluxe paperback edition features  *French flaps  *rough-cut high-quality paper  *complimentary front- and back-cover designs highlighting each novel and including foil and debossing",

The End of Wall   Street is a blow-by-blow account of America's biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. Drawing   on 180 interviews, including sit-downs with top government officials and Wall Street CEOs, Lowenstein tells, with   grace, wit, and razor-sharp understanding, the full story of the end of Wall Street as we knew it. Displaying   the qualities that made When Genius Failed a timeless classic of Wall Street-his sixth sense for narrative   drama and his unmatched ability to tell complicated financial stories in ways that resonate with the ordinary reader-  Roger Lowenstein weaves a financial, economic, and sociological thriller that indicts America for succumbing to the   siren song of easy debt and speculative mortgages. The End of Wall Street is rife with historical   lessons and bursting with fast-paced action. Lowenstein introduces his story with precisely etched, laserlike profiles   of Angelo Mozilo, the Johnny Appleseed of subprime mortgages who spreads toxic loans across the landscape like   wild crabapples, and moves to a damning explication of how rating agencies helped gift wrap faulty loans in the   guise of triple-A paper and a takedown of the academic formulas that-once again- proved the ruin of investors and   banks. Lowenstein excels with a series of searing profiles of banking CEOs, such as the ferretlike Dick Fuld of   Lehman and the bloodless Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan, and of government officials from the restless, deal-obsessed   Hank Paulson and the overmatched Tim Geithner to the cerebral academic Ben Bernanke, who sought to avoid a   repeat of the one crisis he spent a lifetime trying to understand-the Great Depression. Finally, we come   to understand the majesty of Lowenstein's theme of liquidity and capital, which explains the origins of the crisis and   that positions the collapse of 2008 as the greatest ever of Wall Street's unlearned lessons. The End of Wall   Street will be essential reading as we work to identify the lessons of the market failure and start to reb...",

        "Description": "In The Art of a Beautiful Game, Chris Ballard, the award-winning Sports Illustrated writer who has covered the NBA for the past decade, goes behind the scenes to examine basketball in ways that will surprise even die-hard fans. An inveterate hoops junkie who played some college ball, Ballard sits down with the NBA's most passionate, cerebral players to find out their tricks of the trade and to learn what drives them, taking readers away from the usual sports talk radio fodder and deep into the heart of the game.   Ballard talks to Dwight Howard, a prolific shot-blocker, about the enervating feeling of meeting another man at the height of his leap; challenges Steve Kerr to a game of H-O-R-S-E to understand the mentality of a pure shooter; reveals the roots of Kobe Bryant's unmatched killer instinct; and spends time with LeBron James to better understand both his mental game and his seemingly unlimited physical skills. He tracks down renowned dunkers from Dominique to Shaq to explore the impact of the dunk on the modern game, shadows Shane Battier during his preparations to defend LeBron, takes lessons from a freethrow shooting guru who once hit 2,750 in a row, and attends an elite NBA training camp to feel the pain that turns a prospect into a pro.   Packed with lively characters and basketball history, and grounded in superb writing and the reportage that is the hallmark of Sports Illustrated, The Art of a Beautiful Game is an often witty, always insightful look at the men like Steve Nash, Yao Ming, and Alonzo Mourning who devote themselves to this elegant and complicated sport. It ultimately provides basketball fans what they all want: an inside read on the game they love.",

Today the New Apollo Energy Project is poised to revolutionize the production of energy and thereby save our planet. The nation that built the world\u2019s most powerful rockets, its most advanced computers, and its most sophisticated life support systems is ready to create the world\u2019s most powerful solar energy systems, its most advanced wind energy turbines, and its most sophisticated hybrid cars. This will result in nothing less than a second American Revolution. Who are the dreamers in California who believe they can use mirrors and liquid metal to wring more electricity from a ray of sunshine than anyone else on earth can? \u00a0 Who are the innovators who have built a contraption that can turn the energy of a simple wave off the Oregon coast into burnt toast in Idaho? Who are the scientists in Massachusetts who have invented a battery that now runs your hand drill and will soon run your car? Readers will meet them all in this book. They will learn how the new energy economy will grow, the research that is required, and the legislation that must be passed to make the vision a reality. \u00a0 This is a thoughtful, optimistic book, based on sound facts. No one before has tied together the concepts of economic growth and greenhouse gas reductions with such concrete examples. No one has previously told the real stories of the people who are right now on the front lines of the energy revolution. The co-authors, one a U.S. Congressman who is the primary sponsor of the New Apollo Energy Act, and the other the founder of the Apollo Alliance, have joined their experience, expertise, and passion for a clean energy future to lay out the path to stop global warming and gain energy independence.",

        "Title": "Americans in Paris: Life and Death Under Nazi Occupation",
        "Authors": "By Glass, Charles",
        "Description": "Acclaimed journalist Charlie Glass looks to the American expatriate experience of Nazi-occupied Paris to reveal a fascinating forgotten history of the greatest generation. In Americans in Paris, tales of adventure, intrigue, passion, deceit, and survival unfold season by season, from the spring of 1940 to liberation in the summer of 1944, as renowned journalist Charles Glass tells the story of a remarkable cast of expatriates and their struggles in Nazi Paris. Before the Second World War began, approximately thirty thousand Americans lived in Paris, and when war broke out in 1939 almost five thousand remained. As citizens of a neutral nation, the Americans in Paris believed they had little to fear. They were wrong. Glass's discovery of letters, diaries, war documents, and police files reveals as never before how Americans were trapped in a web of intrigue, collaboration, and courage. Artists, writers, scientists, playboys, musicians, cultural mandarins, and ordinary businessmen-all were swept up in extraordinary circumstances and tested as few Americans before or since. Charles Bedaux, a French-born, naturalized American millionaire, determined his alliances as a businessman first, a decision that would ultimately make him an enemy to all. Countess Clara Longworth de Chambrun was torn by family ties to President Roosevelt and the Vichy government, but her fiercest loyalty was to her beloved American Library of Paris. Sylvia Beach attempted to run her famous English-language bookshop, Shakespeare & Company, while helping her Jewish friends and her colleagues in the Resistance. Dr. Sumner Jackson, wartime chief surgeon of the American Hospital in Paris, risked his life aiding Allied soldiers to escape to Britain and resisting the occupier from the first day. These stories and others come together to create a unique portrait of an eccentric, original, diverse American community. Charles Glass has written an exciting, fast-paced, and elegant account of the moral contradictions faced by Americans in Paris during France's dangerous occupation years. For four hard years, from the summer of 1940 until U.S. troops liberated Paris in August 1944, Americans were intimately caught up in the city's fate. Americans in Paris is an unforgettable tale of treachery by some, cowardice by others, and unparalleled bravery by a few.",

It is a brilliant, haunting, heartbreaking story about how love and war inalterably change the lives of those they touch.June Han was only a girl when the Korean War left her orphaned; Hector Brennan was a young GI who fled the petty tragedies of his small town to serve his country. When the war ended, their lives collided at a Korean orphanage where they vied for the attentions of Sylvie Tanner, the beautiful yet deeply damaged missionary wife whose elusive love seemed to transform everything. Thirty years later and on the other side of the world, June and Hector are reunited in a plot that will force them to come to terms with the mysterious secrets of their past, and the shocking acts of love and violence that bind them together.As Lee unfurls the stunning story of June, Hector, and Sylvie, he weaves a profound meditation on the nature of heroism and sacrifice, the power of love, and the possibilities for mercy, salvation, and surrendering oneself to another. Combining the complex themes of identity and belonging of Native Speaker and A Gesture Life with the broad range, energy, and pure storytelling gifts of Aloft, Chang-rae Lee has delivered his most ambitious, exciting, and unforgettable work yet.

The first email, developed for military use, was sent less than forty years ago; by 2011, there will be 3.2 billion users. The average corporate employee now receives upwards of 130 emails per day; by 2009 that number is expected to reach nearly 200. And the flood of messages is ceaseless: for increasing numbers of people, email means work now occupies home time as well as office hours.Drawing extensively on the research of linguists, behavioral scientists, cultural critics, and philosophers, Freeman examines the way email is taking a mounting toll on a variety of behavior, reducing time for leisure and contemplation, despoiling subtlety and expression in language, and separating us from each other in the unending and lonely battle with the overfull inbox. He enters a plea for communication which is slower, more nuanced, and, above all, more sociable.",

During the seven decades from the nation's entry into World War II in 1941 to the present, economic constraints rarely limited what the United States did in the world. That has now changed. The country's soaring deficits, fueled by the huge costs of the financial crash and of its entitlement programs---Social Security, Medicare, and the new health care legislation-will compel a more modest American international agenda. This change will have major effects in every part of the world, as well as in the United States.In assessing the consequences of this new, less costly foreign policy, Mandelbaum, one of America's leading foreign policy experts, describes the policies the United States will have to discontinue; assesses the potential threats from China, Russia, and Iran; and recommends a new policy, centered on reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil, which can do for America and the world in the twenty-first century what the successful policy of containment of the Soviet Union did in the twentieth.",

        "Description": "Never has fast home cooking with fresh ingredients been more important than it is now. The pressure on the home cook is ever increasing: how can I prepare a balanced meal from scratch when I have only 30 minutes to spare, and 4 hungry mouths to feed? I want to make something from scratch for one, but will it be simple enough? Every minute counts-I've got unexpected guests tonight, what can I whip up quick, that won't disappoint?  Family food is not just about fussy eaters and getting the quantities right. It's also about flexible eating-how often does everyone sit around the table together? Once a week if you're lucky! So, food that can be prepared in advance, and simple straightforward dishes, are an essential part of the equation. We've taken all of this into consideration and come up with recipes that cover every need, with speed, so you will never have to resort to the ready meals aisle in the supermarket. The Illustrated Quick Cook is not trying to change the way you eat, introduce you to obscure ingredients, or take you off the beaten track. It's there to make your life easier, from planning, through cooking, to serving.  More than just recipes, The Illustrated Quick Cook offers fantastic value for the price. Extra features include: handy menu planners, recipe chooser galleries, Cheat tips, Cook's Notes, recipe variations, and practical information to introduce you to every time-saving chapter theme. With far more recipes than any of its competitors, and a picture of every finished dish, The Illustrated Quick Cook delivers fast food for every occasion.",

Love and marriage follow in short order, surprising Bean, who feels that her husband is not only the best thing to happen to her, but the only good thing.Then Mick vanishes leading amateur hikers--or \"tuna\" as the guides call them--up Mt. McKinley. Suddenly, Bean is thrown back upon herself and into the company of Mick's mother Hanna, an arthritic woman in her seventies who believes that \"a little larceny is good for the circulation.\"The pair chafe at first, but eventually become partners in a road trip back to California. Mike's disappearance feels like a hole in the heart, they decide, and Hanna tells Bean to prize that hole; it's something no one can take away from her. With gentle humor, pathos, and boundless stores of hope, Marquis writes of Bean's struggle with early widowhood, loss, and moving on.An avid bird-watcher, Bean takes much of her wisdom from the Pemberton Guide to Alaska Birds. Like the globe-crossing birds she so admires, she has struggled to get aloft, but for a delicious, perhaps fleeting moment in this marvelous novel, we see her glide.Book Magazine selected Christopher Marquis as one of \"Ten To Watch In 2003\" for this \"Proulxian saga.\" With its first-rate evocation of landscape and its affectionately drawn characters, A Hole in the Heart marks the publication debut of a prodigiously talented writer.",

Now he brings his wide-ranging knowledge and perceptive intelligence to a thoughtful and thought-provoking exploration of belief \u2014 and lack of belief.Many books and pundits advocate for a specific God, while others adamantly declare there is no God. Yet these strident viewpoints often speak right past each other, rarely convincing anyone but the already convinced. In Spiritual Envy, Krasny helps believers and nonbelievers alike understand their own questions about faith and religion, about God and human responsibility.Krasny challenges each of us to look closely at faith and its power, and to examine the positive and negative aspects of religion as expressed in culture, literature, and human relationships. Personal and universal, timely and timeless, this is a deeply wise yet warmly welcoming conversation, an invitation to ask one\u2019s own questions \u2014 no matter how inconclusive the answers.",
