        "Title": "Extraordinary Minds: Portraits Of 4 Exceptional Individuals And An Examination Of Our Own Extraordinariness (Masterminds Series)",
        "Authors": "By Gardner, Howard",
        "Description": "Fifteen years ago, psychologist and educator Howard Gardner introduced the idea of multiple intelligences, challenging the presumption that intelligence consists of verbal or analytic abilities only\u2014those intelligences that schools tend to measure. He argued for a broader understanding of the intelligent mind, one that embraces creation in the arts and music, spatial reasoning, and the ability to understand ourselves and others.Today, Gardner\u2019s ideas have become widely accepted\u2014indeed, they have changed how we think about intelligence, genius, creativity, and even leadership, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important voices writing on these subjects.Now, in Extraordinary Minds, a book as riveting as it is new, Gardner poses an important question: Is there a set of traits shared by all truly great achievers\u2014those we deem extraordinary\u2014no matter their field or the time period within which they did their important work?In an attempt to answer this question, Gardner first examines how most of us mature into more or less competent adults. He then examines closely four persons who lived unquestionably extraordinary lives\u2014Mozart, Freud, Woolf, and Gandhi\u2014using each as an exemplar of a different kind of extraordinariness: Mozart as the master of a discipline, Freud as the innovative founder of a new discipline, Woolf as the great introspector, and Gandhi as the influencer.What can we learn about ourselves from the experiences of the extraordinary? Interestingly, Gardner finds that an excess of raw power is not the most impressive characteristic shared by superachievers; rather, these extraordinary individuals all have had a special talent for identifying their own strengths and weaknesses, for accurately analyzing the events of their own lives, and for converting into future successes those inevitable setbacks that mark every life.Gardner provides answers to a number of provocative questions, among them: How do we explain extraordinary times\u2014Athens in the fifth century B.C., the T\u2019ang Dynasty in the eighth century, Islamic Society in the late Middle Ages, and New York at the middle of the century? What is the relation among genius, creativity, fame, success, and moral extraordinariness? Does extraordinariness make for a happier, more fulfilling life, or does it simply create a special onus?",

        "Description": "Riveting in intensity, A Gathering of Saints defies belief - yet the characters, the crimes, the lies, the treachery, and the terror portrayed here are based on true but secret episodes from the dark early hours of the Second World War.At summer's end in 1940, London skies turn war-black as Hitler's airborne hordes begin the Blitz. From the bustling working-class East End to the Underground Stations at Charing Cross and Leicester Square, lethal Nazi Flammenbomben transform the city into a cauldron of human suffering. Against this terrifying scene, a lone psychopath plays his own ghastly game, stalking individual victims and killing them with methodical precision. Probing the murders is Detective Inspector Morris Black of Scotland Yard, a middle-aged Jewish widower gifted with an uncanny ability to divine the truth of a crime from the most meager evidence. As Black tracks his man - whom he dubs Queer Jack - from corpse to corpse, he discovers that each victim was killed at the site of a devastating Luftwaffe raid, only hours before the raid occurred!Black soon learns how explosive his discovery is when he is summoned into Churchill's Magic Circle - the supersecret group of officers, politicians, and spies desperate to draw the United States into war despite rumors that American ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy and his British allies want a separate peace with Hitler. Churchill's men tell Black that British intelligence has cracked \"Ultra,\" the Nazi military code. The secret must be kept from the Nazis - even if it means allowing thousands to be killed in cities the Magic Circle knows are about to be bombed. An even worse truth is revealed to Black - a Nazi spy in Britain, known to Intelligence as The Doctor, is probably on the trail of Queer Jack too. Somehow, the murderer knows the Ultra secret. If The Doctor finds him first, the Nazis will know that their code has been broken, and Britain could lose the war.",

During lunch break he celebrates his job by picking up his newly purchased Honda Prelude. Then he walks out of a deli to watch the car being hoisted into a moving van and driven away. Stolen. With the help of Paulie Klein, free-lance wallpaper designer and street-smart hustler, he traces the theft to Lester-the-thief, a New Jersey entrepreneur, who steals cars, to order. And Lester's operation inspires Bradley to steal twenty new Cadillacs, spotless luxury cars he delivers to Lester-the-thief, with clean titles. But, he stole them from a dealership owned by a Philly mob boss; the cars are too hot even for Lester. So Bradley and his girlfriend Lee are stuck with twenty hot cars, wanted by the police and the mob. That's when the complications begin. Written in Peck's buoyant, crisp style, Philly Amateurs is whimsical and tough at the same time. Filled with unique and memorable characters, the story races to a surprising climax.",

        "Title": "True Professionalism",
        "Authors": "By Maister, David H.",
        "Description": "Are technically competent professionals who work long, hard hours \"true\" professionals, seeking superior quality in their work and striving to provide the best service possible to their clients? Or are they \"cruisers\" adhering to standards, but performing below their full potential, lacking the inspiration for the extra level of intensity that creates superb work?  Professional firms are forever trying to get their people to act like professionals -- to do the right things. Though their various incentives may create employee compliance, these don't often encourage excellence. Taking issue with such methods, David Maister, the world's premier consultant to professional service firms, vigorously challenges professionals to examine this essential, yet under-addressed question: What is true professionalism? Essentially, Maister argues, it is a personal commitment to self-betterment and a professional dedication to provide the best and most efficient service to clients. In clear, pragmatic terms, he convincingly advocates the \"power of principles\" -- the most effective tools management can use to inspire excellence in individual performance. His core principles spring from good, sound logic: Believe passionately in what you do, never compromise your standards and values, and care about your clients. Do all of these because they are the ethical things to do and because they are the primary road to commercial success.  In this candid treasury of practical wisdom, Maister expounds some eternal truths about the individual professional, the firm, and the client. He explains how to achieve true professionalism at both the micro and macro levels by answering many key but tough questions, including these: How do you develop a personal career strategy? How does a firm track the profitability of individual assignments? Can and should you guarantee your client's satisfaction? Looking first at the individual, Maister dares those good corporate citizens who \"do their duty\" to discover what they truly love to do, and then to align their real-world actions with their true values -- and he tells them why a continual investment must be made in getting better. Turning to the firm, he focuses on what he calls its \"instability\" and offers advice on how to invest in skill-building. He explains why extra time invested in supervising reaps large financial benefits, and why excellence in client satisfaction should be an enforced standard. A brief example of the clear thinking and sound advice to be found in this handbook: Stress on maximizing billable hours may seem profitable, but instead it encourages employees to be inefficient, it loses the customer's trust and confidence, and eventually it hurts the firm's reputation and profit margin.  The bottom line, according to the author? Act like a true professional and the money will follow.",

        "Title": "Tales of Terror and Detection (Dover Thrift Editions: Gothic/Horror)",
        "Authors": "By Poe, Edgar Allan",
        "Description": "Edgar Allan Poe (1809\u20131849) holds a unique place in American literature. Famous as a poet, he also penned short stories that are masterpieces of terror and suspense, infused with the horror and dread he knew from his feverish dreams and persistent fears of death. Fortunately for lovers of mystery, Poe was attracted by logic and analysis as well as fantasy. Fascinated by the narrative possibilities of tracking the perpetrator of a crime, he invented the modern detective story.This superb collection of five stories reveals Poe's virtuoso gifts for both crime fiction and the macabre. Two of his most famous tales, \"The Mystery of Marie Roget\" and \"The Purloined Letter,\" recount the exploits of C. Auguste Dupin, the first important fictional detective. \"William Wilson\" is a chilling tale of crime and evil. The two remaining stories, \"MS. Found in a Bottle\" and \"The Oblong Box,\" subtly but relentlessly convey a sense of unease, then dread, then outright terror.",

As a novelist, Arundhati Roy is known for her lush language and intricate structure. As a political essayist, her prose is searching and fierce. All of these qualities shine through in the interviews collected by David Barsamian for Globalizing Dissent: Converations with Arundhati Roy. New and devoted readers will find that these exchanges, recorded between 2001 and 2003, add to their appreciation of Roy\u2019s previous work.Whether discussing her childhood or the problems of translation in a multilingual society, Roy and Barsamian, the producer and host of Alternative Radio, engage in a lively and accessible manner. Speaking candidly and casually, Roy describes her participation in a demonstration against the Indian dam program as, \"absolutely fantastic.\" She jokes that her Supreme Court charge for \"corrupting public morality\"\u2014in the case of her novel The God of Small Things\u2014should have been changed to \"further corrupting public morality.\" She calls on her training as an architect to explain what she means by the \"physics of power.\" Like a house of cards, she argues that \"unfettered power . . . cannot go berserk like this and expect to hold it all together.\"Roy has been acclaimed for her courage (Salman Rushdie) and her eloquence (Kirkus Reviews), and her writing has been described as \"a banquet for the senses\" (Newsweek). She has found a readership among fiction enthusiasts and political activists. Globalizing Dissent captures Roy speaking one-on-one to her audience, revealing her intense and wide-ranging intellect, her very personal voice, and her opinion on momentous political events.Arundhati Roy\u2019s novel The God of Small Things was awarded the Booker Prize in 1997. She is the recipient of the 2002 Lannan Foundation Prize for Cultural Freedom.",

        "Description": "The relative peace and prosperity of the Elizabethan age (1558\u20131603) fostered the growth of one of the most fruitful eras in literary history. Lyric poetry, prose, and drama flourished in sixteenth-century England in works that blended medieval traditions with Renaissance optimism.This anthology celebrates the wit and imaginative creativity of the Elizabethan poets with a generous selection of their graceful and sophisticated verse. Highlights include sonnets from Astrophel and Stella, written by Sir Philip Sidney \u2014 a scholar, poet, critic, courtier, diplomat, soldier, and ideal English Renaissance man; poems by Edmund Spenser, whose works combined romance with allegory, adventure, and morality; and sonnets by William Shakespeare, whose towering poetic genius transcends the ages. Other celebrated contributors include John Donne (\"Go, and catch a fallen star\"), Ben Jonson (\"Drink to me only with thine eyes\"), and Christopher Marlowe (\"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\"). The poetry of lesser-known figures such as Michael Drayton, Samuel Daniel, and Fulke Greville appears here, along with verses by individuals better known in other fields \u2014 Francis Bacon, Queen Elizabeth I, and Walter Raleigh \u2014 whose poems offer valuable insights into the spirit of the age.",

Stephen Strauss's entertaining compendium of measurement facts and comparisons will help readers answer hundreds of perplexing questions that are rarely solved in conventional reference books.Strauss considers the entire world of measuring, and discovers that every method of measurement - from biblical times to the present - speaks volumes about the cultural assumptions of the society in which each originates.In later sections Strauss moves on to the Wordsaurus, a complete glossary of measurement terms, and finally to the Sizesaurus itself, in which detailed conversion tables provide common equivalents of scientific measurements. These handy conversion tables compare ounces against centigrams, inches against centimeters, Celsius against Fahrenheit, and so on.The Sizesaurus is truly a thesaurus of measurements that allows readers to understand how measurement affects everything in our world, from sound to heat to food to computers to electricity to outer space.",

From the boss who publicly chews out her assistant and the student who bullies his professor to the sports fan who yells obscenities at the ballgame, there's little doubt that we live in an increasingly barbaric world. When author Steven Selzer was researching the subject of civility, he found that George Washington had written 110 rules of civility and decent behavior at the age of 14. Although these guidelines are 250 years old, they are still pertinent in today's society. By George: Mr. Washington's Guide to Civility presents the 110 rules with engaging and conversational commentary after each rule, describing how it can be applied in modern life. Interspersed throughout the book are anecdotes, sidebars, and quotes. The tips and principles in By George will enable readers to better handle interpersonal conflicts, conduct business, and manage everyday stress with grace and civility.Rule # 56Associate yourself with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for 'tis better to be alone than in bad company.Rule # 40Strive not with your superiors in argument, but always submit your judgment to others with modesty.Rule # 37In speaking to others, do not lean nor look them full in the face, nor approach too near them. At least keep a full pace from them.Rule # 35Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.Rule # 22Show not yourself glad at the misfortune of another though he were your enemy.",

Drawing on cutting-edge neurological research, how to keep your brain alive: 83 neurobic exercises brings help to everyone whose memory is starting to slip. Devised by Dr. Lawrence Katz, a professor of neurobiology at Duke University Medical Center, and Manning Rubin, author of 60 Ways to Relieve Stress in 60 Seconds, here is a regimen of mental cross-training that can be done anywhere, by anyone, at any time of day. The premise is simple: When you exercise the brain, you release natural growth factors called neurotrophins, which in turn enhance the brain's level of fitness. And nothing so easily stimulates the brain as breaking routines and using the five senses in new and unexpected ways. So if you're right-handed, wake up tomorrow and brush your teeth with your left hand. Or close your eyes before you get into the car and then get the key into the ignition. Every time you open a new circuit in your brain, it's like doing a round of mental sit-ups, without the pain.",

A trick that does not depend upon legerdemain or special abilities on the part of the magician, but a trick that works automatically because of the mathematics inherent in the card deck itself. Long practice and supernormal dexterity are not needed to perform these tricks, yet they are often among the most entertaining and most spectacular of all card tricks.Some of these sure-fire tricks are simple, a good place to begin. Others were specially adapted from professional routines and are here presented for the first time for amateurs. Almost all of these tricks can be worked informally, with a borrowed deck of cards. Some also adapt to stage presentation.Individual tricks in this book have sold for more than the price of the entire book. Amateurs can use them to get a start in magic and to feel, at once, the rewards of giving a professional performance. Advanced and professional magicians will find tricks to add to their acts or informal routines. Author Karl Fulves is one of the best-known writers and editors in the field of magic.",

Richard Hawke delivers a winner.\"--Michael ConnellyIt\u2019s a beautiful Thanksgiving morning in New York City. Perfect day for a parade, and Fritz Malone just happens to have drifted up Central Park West to take a look at the floats. Across the crowd-filled street he sees a gunman on a low wall, taking aim with a shiny black Beretta. Seconds later, the air is filled with bullets and blood. Fritz isn\u2019t one to stand around and watch. A child of Hell\u2019s Kitchen and the bastard son of a beloved former police commissioner, Fritz is all too familiar with the city\u2019s rougher side. As the gunman flees into the park, Fritz runs after him. What he doesn\u2019t know is that he is also running into one of the most shocking and treacherous episodes of his life.Though Fritz assumed that chasing down bad guys is perfectly legal, the cops hustle him from the scene and deliver him to the office of the current commissioner, who informs Fritz that someone dubbed \u201cNightmare\u201d has been taunting the city\u2019s leaders for weeks, warning of an imminent attack on the citizenry. What\u2019s worse, Nightmare has already let the officials know that the parade gunman was a mere foot soldier and that there\u2019s more carnage to come unless the city meets his impossible demands. The pols don\u2019t dare share this information with anyone\u2013not even the NYPD. What they need for this job is an outside man. And in Fritz they think they\u2019ve got one.Racing against the tightest of clocks, Fritz finds himself confounded by Nightmare\u2019s multiple masks and messengers. The killer is simultaneously everywhere and nowhere. But as Fritz\u2019s frantic investigation takes him from a convent in the Bronx to a hookers\u2019 haven in central Brooklyn, the story behind the story\u2013complete with wicked secrets on both sides of the law\u2013begins to emerge. As Fritz zeroes in on the terrible, gruesome truth, the killer retaliates by making things personal, forcing Fritz to grapple with his deepest fear: sometimes nightmares really do come true.In his brilliantly paced and stunningly original debut, Richard Hawke delivers a tale of flawed and unforgettable people operating at the ends of their ropes. It\u2019s literary suspense that doesn\u2019t let go until the last page.",

His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the theatrical repertoire.An Ideal Husband revolves around a blackmail scheme that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards \u2014 providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace.Like most of Wilde's plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise, well-constructed, and deeply satisfying. An instant success at its 1895 debut, the play continues to delight audiences over one hundred years later. An Ideal Husband is a must-read for Wilde fans, students of English literature, and anyone delighted by wit, urbanity, and timeless sophistication.",

The ship vanishes without a trace.

Storming through the crowds, the horsemen brutally attack anyone standing between them and their prize. Attending the gala, archaeologist Tess Chaykin watches in silent terror as the leader of the horsemen hones in on one piece in particular, a strange geared device. He utters a few cryptic Latin words as he takes hold of it with reverence before leading the horsemen out and disappearing into the night.  In the aftermath, an FBI investigation is led by anti-terrorist specialist Sean Reilly. Soon, he and Tess are drawn into the dark, hidden history of the crusading Knights, plunging them into a deadly game of cat and mouse with ruthless killers as they race across three continents to recover the lost secret of the Templars.",

They don't think of themselves as pioneers, though that's what they became. Unhappy with the public schools, the Colfaxes wanted the best education possible for their four sons: a program for learning that met the evolving needs of each child and gave them complete control of how and what their children learned. The results? A prescription for excellence-Harvard educations for their sons Grant, Drew, and Reed. (Their fourth son is still too young for college.)Now the Colfaxes tell how all parents can become involved in homeschooling. In a straight-talking book that reads like a frank conversation among friends, they tell what they did and how they did it: their educational approaches, the lessons they learned, and what materials-books, equipment, educational aids-proved most useful over the years. Best of all, they show you how you can take charge of your children's education-in an invaluable sourcebook that will help you find a rewarding and successful alternative to our failing schools.",

        "Description": "During the last half of the nineteenth century, America's favorite pictorial storytellers were Currier and Ives, printmakers extraordinary. Hundreds of thousands of Currier and Ives's hand-colored engravings made their way onto the walls of homes across the country. From pastoral America to bustling scenes of city life, horse racing, fire fighting - you name it - Nathaniel Currier and James Merrit Ives pictured it.Numerous previous books have surveyed the charming Currier and Ives repertoire, which numbers some seven thousand subjects. Published here for the first time, however, are more than seventy-five of the 204 prints that Currier and Ives created especially to appeal to Irish-Americans. At the time these pictures were published many who bought them were newly arrived in the United States, victims of the terrible famines and farm evictions in Ireland in the 1840s and 1850s. As this new population grew and its affluence increased, these colorful Currier and Ives prints served well as reminders of home, the Ireland left behind.The prints show the Irish landscape, key moments in Irish history, portraits of men and women of importance, and episodes of daily life.All these fascinating and handsome subjects of Irish-American interest and more are included in the book. Seventy-seven of them are reproduced in color. Discovered and selected by author Kevin O'Rourke, they are accompanied by his lively text, which details the historical background for all the scenes and offers brief biographies of the individuals portrayed. The book also includes a brief biography of the firm of Currier and Ives, notes on collecting Currier and Ives prints, a directory of dealers, and a complete listing of the 204 known Irish-American subjects.",
