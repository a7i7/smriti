        "Description": "In 1869 Japan, a young woman escapes the confines of her arranged marriage by painting memories of her lover on mulberry paper. She secretly wraps the painting around a ceramic pot that's bound for Europe. In France, a disenchanted young man works as a clerk at an import shop. When he opens the box from Japan, he discovers the brilliant watercolor of two lovers locked in an embrace under a plum tree. He steals the painting and hides it in his room. With each viewing, he sees something different, and gradually the painting transforms him.Set outside the new capital of Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration and in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War, The Painting is a richly imagined story of four characters whose lives are delicately and powerfully entwined: Ayoshi, the painter, pines for her lover as she dutifully attends to her husband; Ayoshi's husband, Hayashi, a government official who's been disfigured in a deadly fire, has his own well of secret yearnings; Jorgen, wounded by the war and by life, buries himself in work at the Paris shop; and the shop owner's sister, Natalia, who shows Jorgen the true message of the painting.Exquisitely written and utterly spellbinding, The Painting reveals the enduring effect of art in ordinary life and marks the debut of a skilled stylist and first-rate storyteller.",

First, I knew more about my cholesterol than I did my character. What are the qualities of godly character, and how am I developing them in my life? Second, although our nation is putting millions of dollars into character education in schools, we aren\u2019t seeing positive results. How can that be changed? There\u2019s no way I can change a culture overnight, but I can help people understand and learn how to cultivate godly character one heart at a time.

Without knowing who or where they were, or how he would find them, James Twyman began an extraordinary journey to find Marco and the psychic children. In the process, he learned that the children had a message for all the world-and learned, too, that he was the one to deliver that message.This is that message.",

Yet few Americans realize the crucial role that generosity plays in keeping that fragile balance. A leading voice for community development, scholar and former Connecticut College president Claire Gaudiani examines the crucial role of philanthropy in American prosperity. She traces the entrepreuneurial spirit of altruism, finding that generous gifts have powerfully invested in the most critical ingredients of the American economy: people, property, and ingenuity. Rather than pitting the capitalists against the populists, Gaudiani draws a blueprint for a just future, full of opportunities, based on giving.The Greater Good is a passionate, pragmatic, and optimistic manifesto for revitalizing the promise of the American economy.",

What she doesn't expect is that the articles will set off a murderous chain reaction -- and put her life in peril.Perhaps one of the more tragic disappearances in recent Las Piernas history was that of Jenny Fletcher, just shy of her fourth birthday. The body of Jenny's father, Richard, a graphic artist, was found bludgeoned in his studio; hours later Jenny's stepbrother Mason was apprehended with the murder weapon and bloody clothing in his car. But little Jenny was never found. As the years pass, everyone assumes Jenny is dead. Everyone except her brother Caleb, who not only believes Jenny survived but steadfastly believes in Mason's innocence.Caleb, now a graduate student studying with forensic anthropologist Ben Sheridan, works on cases for the Las Piernas Police Department. When bones are discovered at the old Sheffield estate just days after the missing-children articles appear, Caleb finds himself drawn into a case that threatens to bring personal tragedies back to the present. He has a fierce ally in reporter Irene Kelly, who will stop at nothing to solve the mysteries of his father's murder and his sister's disappearance.",

Bret Easton Ellis trains his incisive gaze on the kids at self-consciously bohemian Camden College and treats their sexual posturings and agonies with a mixture of acrid hilarity and compassion while exposing the moral vacuum at the center of their lives.Lauren changes boyfriends every time she changes majors and still pines for Victor who split for Europe months ago and she might or might not be writing anonymous love letter to ambivalent, hard-drinking Sean, a hopeless romantic who only has eyes for Lauren, even if he ends up in bed with half the campus, and Paul, Lauren's ex, forthrightly bisexual and whose passion masks a shrewd pragmatism.  They waste time getting wasted, race from Thirsty Thursday Happy Hours to Dressed To Get Screwed parties to drinks at The Edge of the World or The Graveyard.  The Rules of Attraction is a poignant, hilarious take on the death of romance.",

Many struggle with unrequited love, infertility, the pain of separation, failure, uncertainty, and unfulfilled plans. But somewhere between seeing life as all rosy and seeing it as a vale of tears, Leigh McLeroy takes readers on a journey through the beauty and joy in this sometimes painful world.With exquisite writing and soul-deep reflections, Leigh weaves her own personal stories with biblical narratives to engage readers in the compelling mystery of living in between this world and God's kingdom. In The Beautiful Ache, she calls readers to embrace the gap between life hoped for and life as it is-to press on for that which fully satisfies.",

In his career as one of America\u2019s elite warriors, Lt. Sam Starrett  can do no wrong. In his private life, Sam\u2013the king of one night stands\u2013has done little  right. Now, he\u2019s waiting for a divorce and determined to stay active in his young  daughter\u2019s life. But when Sam shows up at the door of his ex-wife\u2019s home in Sarasota,  Florida, he makes a grisly discovery. His daughter is gone and the body of a woman  lies brutally murdered on the floor. FBI agent Alyssa Locke\u2019s relationship with  Sam has been overwhelmingly intense and nearly catastrophic, yet it refuses to end.  The last time she saw Sam was six months earlier, when they worked together to stop  terrorists from assassinating the U.S. President. Much to her dismay, Alyssa is assigned  to lead the murder investigation and once again the two are face to face. When explosive  information surfaces linking Sam to the still unsolved assassination plot, the stakes  are raised. With her reputation hanging in the balance, and her loyalties in question,  Alyssa is faced with an impossible dilemma:arrest a man she believes to be innocent,  or risk her career. While Alyssa tries to fight their intense attraction, Sam is  determined to heat things up between them once again. And the complex case pushes  them both to the wrong side of the law\u2013and on the run to discover the truth. As more  agents step into the chase, and with Sam\u2019s daughter still unaccounted for, neither  Alyssa nor Sam can predict just how deadly hot this situation is about to become.  . . . A thrilling novel that ranges back into the days of World War II, into friendships,  families, liaisons, betrayals, and the code of honor that binds the U.S. Navy SEALs,  Gone Too Far is an electrifying experience in suspense\u2013and a brilliant tale of lives  lived on the edge.",

For actress Alfre Woodard and her daughter Mavis, the connection with horses is spiritual. Chevy Chase says his Icelandics \"get very hairy during the winter, but then so do I.\" And Robert Redford, recalling his month-long ride down the old Outlaw Trail that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid rode, says: \"What I marvel at is how wild and free this land still can seem from the back of a horse.\" In People We Know, Horses They Love, we meet nearly thirty celebrity horse lovers, from Whoopi Goldberg and Christie Brinkley to the original horse whisperer, Buck Brannaman and bestselling author Tami Hoag, who's also an amateur international champion dressage rider. Gorgeous, full-color, never-seen-before photographs capture the majesty and grace of the animals, the beauty of the ranches and stables where they reside and intimate moments shared with their owners. Whether highlighting Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward on their ranch for special needs children, exploring Hilary Duff's passion for wild mustangs, hanging with Jeff Bridges on the set of Seabiscuit, or illuminating the interior lives of Maria Shriver, Morgan Freeman, and many others, People We Know, Horses They Love pays tribute to the special relationship between human and horse.

He doesn't know he's not like everyone else. And one winter night, Zinkoff's differences show that any name can someday become \"hero.\"With some of his finest writing to date and great wit and humor, Jerry Spinelli creates a story about a boy's individuality surpassing the need to fit in and the genuine importance of failure.

        "Description": "The book that sparked a marketing revolution.\"This is a subversive book. It says that the marketer is not--and ought not to be--at the center of successful marketing. The customer should be. Are you ready for that?\" --From the Foreword by Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point.Counter to traditional marketing wisdom, which tries to count, measure, and manipulate the spread of information, Seth Godin argues that the information can spread most effectively from customer to customer, rather than from business to customer. Godin calls this powerful customer-to- customer dialogue the ideavirus, and cheerfully eggs marketers on to create an environment where their ideas can replicate and spread.In lively detail, Godin looks at the ways companies such as PayPal, Hotmail, GeoCities, even Volkswagen have successfully launched ideaviruses. He offers a \"recipe\" for creating your own ideavirus, identifies the key factors in the successful spread of an ideavirus (powerful sneezers, hives, a clear vector, a smooth, friction-free transmission), and shows how any business, large or small, can use ideavirus marketing to succeed in a world that just doesn't want to hear it anymore from the traditional marketers.",

It's Girls A-Go-Go Down the Mississippi read the headline in the Paducah, Kentucky, paper.  Thirty-five years later, four of those \"girls\" reunite to cruise the river again. This time it's on the luxury steamboat, The Belle of Natchez, and there's no publicity. This time, when they reach New Orleans, they'll give the river the ashes of a fifth rafter-beautiful Margaret (\"Baby\") Ballou.  Revered for her powerful female characters, here Lee Smith tells a brilliantly authoritative story of how college pals who grew up in an era when they were still called \"girls\" have negotiated life as \"women.\" Harriet Holding is a hesitant teacher who has never married (she can't explain why, even to herself). Courtney Gray struggles to step away from her Southern Living-style life. Catherine Wilson, a sculptor, is suffocating in her happy third marriage. Anna Todd is a world-famous romance novelist escaping her own tragedies through her fiction. And finally there is Baby, the girl they come to bury-along with their memories of her rebellions and betrayals.  THE LAST GIRLS is wonderful reading. It's also wonderfully revealing of women's lives-of the idea of romance, of the relevance of past to present, of memory and desire.",

His mother is transformed by the strange state of her son's existence to face her own past. Meanwhile, projects to build a nuclear reactor and drain vital wetlands preoccupy Paul as if he were at work. By the time he is cured, both families have been changed. On his return to his home and career, his parents go to Mexico to fulfill the archaeological vocation Adrian sacrificed to support his family. The consequence of this trip is the final surprise in this extraordinary exploration of passionate individual existences.\"This novel begins superbly and ends wonderfully, and in between there are passages of high intelligence, not without Gordimer's signature asperity.\u201d -- Ward Just, The Washington Post Book World",
