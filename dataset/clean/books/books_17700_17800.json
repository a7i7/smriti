        "Authors": "By Patterson, Richard North",
        "Description": "A compelling new novel from Richard North Patterson- a major departure, and that confirms his place among the most important popular novelists at work today.A newly elected president faces the unexpected chance to nominate a new chief justice of the Supreme Court.  His first choice is a nationally respected Court of Appeals judge, a woman whose nomination faces two serious obstacles: a long-held personal secret; and the prospect that a volatile abortion case- a trial pitting a 15-year-old girl against her pro-life parents- will come before the court.  And the Senate majority leader is determined to thwart the president's nomination for reasons that cross the boundary between the political and the personal.As these stories intertwine, building in complexity and suspense, Patterson gives us the resounding clash of competing ambitions between the president and the majority leader; the equally momentous collision of science and culture in the courtroom; and, in an unprecedented novelistic depiction of the legal process from the perspective of the judge rather than the lawyers, a revelation of both how the judicial system works and how it intersects with politics, for better or for worse.PROTECT AND DEFEND is a triumph- the definitive novel of politics and law at the dawn of the 21st century.",

        "Title": "The Roosevelts: An American Saga",
        "Authors": "By Collier, Peter and Horowitz, David",
        "Description": "The story of the Roosevelts is usually seen as a tale of two presidents - Theodore and Franklin - who were distant cousins from distinct worlds, separated by time and politics. And of two families - the Oyster Bay and Hyde Park branches - that had little to do with each other. Now comes an explosive new portrait, The Roosevelts: An American Saga, which offers a completely unique view of America's longest lasting and most powerful dynasty.The Roosevelts were one family, an exclusive elite who began their history intimately related by bonds of love and ambition. In this brilliant biography, we see for the first time how the family divided into two branches and began an epic battle for the family legacy. We see for the first time how the ideals of two presidents were passed on to members of later generations, ennobling some and crushing others. The Roosevelts is a rare look at what brought this exceptional group of people together and what drove them apart.In this riveting book we see Teddy, the flamboyant politician and Rough Rider, who was also a \"Papa Bear,\" passing on an ethos of sacrifice and achievement to his \"cubs.\" There is Theodore Jr., the \"crown prince,\" handpicked by his father to carry on the traditions of Oyster Bay but unable to complete the mission. And Alice, Teddy's acid-tongued and fiercely loyal daughter, whose antics became the talk of Washington and who finally became a caricature, raving against her cousin's New Deal and trying desperately to preserve her father's legacy. There's also Eleanor, daughter of Teddy's tragic brother, Elliott, who translated the unhappiness of her marriage to FDR into political activism, eventually becoming First Lady of the World. And finally there is Franklin, always underestimated by Teddy's family, who made an alliance with Eleanor to become the nemesis of the Oyster Bay Roosevelts and, in the web of ironies that bind this family together, a truer heir to Teddy than any of his own children.Filled with drama and anecdote, presenting familiar characters in a penetrating new light, The Roosevelts is a soaring tale of triumph over heartbreak and frailty. But it is also a daunting story of the vanity of human wishes.",

        "Title": "General Ike: A Personal Reminiscence",

        "Description": "John S.D. Eisenhower modestly explains General Ike as \"a son's view of a great military leader -- highly intelligent, strong, forceful, kind, yet as human as the rest of us.\" It is that, and more: a portrait of the greatest Allied military leader of the Second World War, by the man who knew Ike best.   General Ike is a book that John Eisenhower always knew he had to write, a tribute from an affectionate and admiring son to a great father. John chose to write about the \"military Ike,\" as opposed to the \"political Ike,\" because Ike cared far more about his career in uniform than about his time in the White House. A series of portraits of Ike's relations with soldiers and statesmen, from MacArthur to Patton to Montgomery to Churchill to de Gaulle, reveals the many facets of a talented, driven, headstrong, yet diplomatic leader.  Taken together, they reveal a man who was brilliant, if flawed; naive at times in dealing with the public, yet who never lost his head when others around him were losing theirs.  Above all, General Ike was a man who never let up in the relentless pursuit of the destruction of Hitler.  Here for the first time are eyewitness stories of General Patton showing off during military exercises; of Ike on the verge of departing for Europe and assuming command of the Eastern Theater; of Churchill stewing and lobbying Ike in his \"off hours.\" Faced with giant personalities such as these men and MacArthur, not to mention difficult allies such as de Gaulle and Montgomery, Ike nevertheless managed to pull together history's greatest invasion force and to face down a determined enemy from Normandy to the Bulge and beyond. John Eisenhower masterfully uses the backdrop of Ike's key battles to paint a portrait of his father and his relationships with the great men of his time.  General Ike is a ringing and inspiring testament to a great man by an accomplished historian. It is also a personal portrait of a caring, if not always available, father by his admiring son.

        "Description": "\u201cZero tolerance\u201d began as a prohibition against guns, but it has quickly expanded into a frenzy of punishment and tougher disciplinary measures in American schools. Ironically, as this timely collection makes clear, recent research indicates that as schools adopt more zero tolerance policies they in fact become less safe, in part because the first casualties of these measures are the central, critical relationships between teacher and student and between school and community.Zero Tolerance assembles prominent educators and intellectuals, including the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Sr., Michelle Fine, and Patricia Williams, along with teachers, students, and community activists, to show that the vast majority of students expelled from schools under new disciplinary measures are sent home for nonviolent violations; that the rush to judge and punish disproportionately affects black and Latino children; and that the new disciplinary ethos is eroding constitutional protections of privacy, free speech, and due process. Sure to become the focus of controversy, Zero Tolerance presents a passionate, multifaceted argument against the militarization of our schools.",

Much more than a mere observer, she connects with these young people on an intimate level, and the candor with which they reveal themselves to her is truly astonishing. This is the first in-depth front-line exploration of the country's new moral majority - dressed up in punk-rock garb - and what its influence could mean for the future of America.",

Giving The Love That Heals offers a unique opportunity for personal transformation that will lead us to a conscious, and thus healthier, relationship with our children.Harville Hendrix and Helen Hunt help us explore:?The Imago -- the fantasy partner that our unconscious mind constructs from those we loved as a child, a that has guided our search for a life partner ?Maximizer and Minimizer parents -- the defensive styles that internally shape what we say and how interact with our children ?A Parenting Process that all parents can use to end the \"cycle of wounding\" -- the handing-down of wounding we received as children -- as we parent our own children, regardless of their age ?The most effective way to nurture the stages of our child's growth while remaining mindful of how each stage affects the child's relationships, both to us and to their world and their future ?Safety, Support, and Structure -- how to give children what they really need from us ?Modeling Adulthood -- recovering our innate wholeness to provide a model of adulthood for our children that will preserve their innate wholeness.In this profound, groundbreaking book, Harville Hendrix and Helen Hunt lead us through an extraordinary process of growth as we help our children to become healthy, responsible, and caring people.",

Tommy Carmellini, a CIA operative who is unafraid to walk both sides of the law to attain his objective, uncovers a dark conspiracy that leads to the highest levels of the American government-and to a ruthless manipulator who will stop at nothing to keep a decades-old secret.Liars and Thieves opens as Carmellini is sent to post guard duty at a farmhouse in West Virginia's remote Allegheny Mountains, where top government operatives are debriefing a star defector: the ultimate KGB insider, a man with records on every operation and every dirty trick the shadowy intelligence agency has ever run, from Lenin to Putin.Carmellini arrives to find the guards shot dead and a ruthless team of commandos--American commandos--killing everyone in sight, then setting the house on fire. He escapes in a hail of bullets with what seems to be the sole survivor, a stunningly attractive translator who then steals his car, abandoning him, after a deadly mountain car chase.But one other person survived the massacre: The man whose fractured memory holds the KGB's most embarrassing secrets, including something for which someone will kill to keep it quiet. Carmellini teams up with his mentor, Admiral Jake Grafton, and together they track down the amnesiac defector. From there, the hunt is on as they become the target of a lethal squad of killers who can only be taking direction from someone very close to the president. From a bloody ambush at a posh Virginia estate, to assassinations on the decaying streets of inner city Washington, to a makeshift safe house at Grafton's Delaware summer home, no place is outside the ruthless conspiracy's reach. Carmellini and Grafton must learn to tell friend from foe as they fight their way through a poisonous wilderness of intrigue, all the way to a presidential convention in New York City-and to the surprising identity of someone standing on the verge of absolute power who has jeopardized the safety of the entire nation to prevent a dark secret from ever seeing the light of day.",

        "Description": "In James A. Michener's Mexico, one of the world's greatest bestselling writers tells the story of a tumultuous land, in a novel that vividly captures the sweep of Mexico's colorful history and teems with a multitude of unforgettable characters.Moving between the past and present - from important events in Mexico's history to the excitement of a modern-day bullfight - and ranging from the arid plains of Mexico to Inquisition Spain and Civil War Virginia, here is the stirring saga of a man and a nation searching for their identities.Norman Clay, an American journalist, arrives in Mexico not only to report on the decisive duel between two celebrated matadors but also to learn more about his family's past. As he uncovers the story of his Mexican ancestors - among them an indomitable Indian queen, a conquistador priest, and a Confederate expatriate - the dramatic history of Mexico unfolds: the brilliance and brutality of an ancient native culture; the Spaniards' struggle to win souls and silver in the sixteenth century; the Mexican-American War; and the birth of a modern nation in bloodshed and revolution.Mr. Michener began to write this novel in 1961. After many months of research and writing he put it aside to work on another project, and then another, and eventually lost track of it. Thirty years later he discovered the lost manuscript and set to work completing it. The result is another Michener triumph, following in the magnificent tradition of Centennial, Texas, and Alaska.",

        "Description": "Science has never been more crucial to deciding the political issues facing the country. Yet science and scientists have less influence with the federal government than at any time since the Eisenhower administration. In the White House and Congress today, findings are reported in a politicized manner; spun or distorted to fit the speaker's agenda; or, when they're too inconvenient, ignored entirely. On a broad array of issues-stem cell research, climate change, missile defense, abstinence education, product safety, environmental regulation, and many others-the Bush administration's positions fly in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus. Federal science agencies, once fiercely independent under both Republican and Democratic presidents, are increasingly staffed by political appointees and fringe theorists who know industry lobbyists and evangelical activists far better than they know the science. This is not unique to the Bush administration, but it is largely a Republican phenomenon, born of a conservative dislike of environmental, health, and safety regulation, and at the extremes, of evolution and legalized abortion. In The Republican War on Science, Chris Mooney ties together the disparate strands of the attack on science into a compelling and frightening account of our government's increasing unwillingness to distinguish between legitimate research and ideologically driven pseudoscience.",

Lewis, reporters for The New York Times, tell how the barons of the CIA could not believe that its headquarters harbored a traitor. For years, the Agency was baffled by a wily Russian spymaster who played a high-stakes chess game against the Americans, deceiving the CIA into thinking that there were other moles -- or no moles at all.It took nearly eight years for the CIA to share the full facts of the scenario with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Once they knew those facts, the men and women of the FBI tracked Ames day and night for nine months before they arrested him. They tell their story here in astonishing detail for the first time.The interviews are entirely on-the-record. There are no pseudonyms, anonymous quotes, or invented scenes. The men betrayed by Ames were real people, and the stories of their lives are the true history of the espionage game in the waning years of the cold war.",

Yet in the media, we have stripped away the very rules created to protect them, leaving them almost entirely to the profit-driven manipulations of the free market.  THE OTHER PARENT THE INSIDE STORY OF THE MEDIA'S EFFECT ON OUR CHILDREN  James P. Steyer's explosive investigation into how the media affects our children is a groundbreaking book that will shock most parents. Through songs on the radio, Internet access, television, and movies, our kids are learning how to live in an adult world long before they are ready. They are besieged on a daily basis by images of sex, commercialism, and violence via such mainstream programming as Dawson's Creek, films such as American Pie and The Matrix, and computer games such as Doom and Quake. \"This is the new media reality,\" Steyer states, \"and it is one most parents are not prepared for.\"  Steyer examines how we have allowed media to bombard our children's lives and he offers practical advice on countering the incessant parade of images that frighten, intrigue, and influence America's kids:   Putting your kids on a media diet Finding alternative activities for them besides television and the Internet Discovering what they think about the commercials, programs, and music they encounter on a daily basis Organizing advocacy groups, contacting government leaders, and boycotting media outlets that target children with inappropriate content.   The Other Parent is a powerful and provocative book about the media's incredible impact on our families and our society.",
