She sees some things she'd rather forget, learns some things about herself she'd rather not know, and ultimately must find the answer to one burning question--if only she knew what the question was. Written in sharp, witty verse, Wendy Mass crafts an extraordinary tale of a spunky heroine who hasn't always made the right choices, but needs to discover what makes life worth living.",

She is surprised when her uncle Matt, a nearby farmer, welcomes her with the rather mystifying advice to play it \u201ccivil and strange,\u201d a local expression meaning \u201cbe polite on the surface but keep your distance\u201d \u2014 and even more surprised to find herself attracting the attentions of a younger man. But when the two of them are spotted together and Ellen becomes the focus of her fellow villagers\u2019 gossip and judgment, Matt\u2019s words resonate in a new way. Ellen realizes how little she understands about life in Ballindoon, leading her to question not only her choices, but herself. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Matt and to his friend Beatrice, a widow still troubled by her eldest child\u2019s suicide, and begins to glimpse how the web of connection that defines village life can also be sustaining \u2014 which frees her to take a few risks of her own. To Ellen\u2019s great wonder, as the events of this transformative, tumultuous year play out in all three of their lives, it becomes clear that even tradition-bound Ballindoon can allow for new beginnings. Anchored by the cadences of its Irish setting and the love story at its heart, Civil and Strange offers a moving exploration of the possibilities open to us, at any age, in any place, if only we are brave enough to embrace them.",

        "Title": "Sarah Canary (Ballantine Reader's Circle)",
        "Authors": "By Fowler, Karen Joy",
        "Description": "1. Who is Sarah Canary ? 2. One of the themes of Sarah Canary is how perception shapes reality. Henry James once said 'one cannot truly escape one's background--where one comes from has everything to do with one's point of view.' Hence, Chin, Adelaide, B.J., and Harold have vastly different views when it comes to the identity of Sarah Canary . Given this, why do you think Karen Joy Fowler leaves the question of Sarah Canary 's identity a mystery? 3. How important is Sarah Canary 's identity? 4. Why do you think Fowler has intertwined her narrative with short chapters of actual events from the nineteenth century? 5. Why do you think Fowler begins many chapters with quotes from Emily Dickinson? 6. Sarah Canary is set in the Washington Territory in the 1870s, just after the American Civil War. From a historical and geographic standpoint, what is the significance of this setting for Sarah Canary ? 7. Chin talks about the one-winged bird and Burke talks about nature loving symmetry. Is it also human nature to condemn something that is different or irregular? Why? 8. What does Tom mean when he says, 'The earth talks to us, but we don't speak its language. Why should it not mean something just because you don't understand?' 9. What is the author's attitude toward Charles Darwin, Sigmund Freud, and science in general? 10. The last chapter of the book reports recent news events--Jim Bakker's fall from grace, the massacre in Tiananmen Square, President Reagan's politically incorrect speech about the plight of the American Indian, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reporting evidence of a Chinese wild man, headlines in the Weekly World News of a wounded Civil War soldier being found alive, and a report in the Worldwide Gazette of a 'Flea Circus Horror.' Why do you think the author ends the book this way? 11. What is the significance of Burke's little mermaid? 12. The main characters in Sarah Canary --a Chinese railway worker, a suffragist, an escaped mental patient, and a huckster--are all considered outcasts of the age. Who are their modern equivalents and how do their experiences differ from those of people who have been marginalized in the past? 13. One critic remarked that 'Fowler has an uncompromising and informed political vision.' How would you describe the author's political position and how does it shape the story? 14. Consider the following excerpt: 'Sanity is a delicate concept, lunacy only slightly less so. Over the last few centuries, more and more of those phenomena once believed to belong to God have been assigned to the authority of the psychoanalyst instead. Some of the saints can be diagnosed in retrospect as epileptics. St. Theresa was almost certainly an hysteric. St. Ida of Lorraine seems to have suffered from perceptional insanity. She only thought her body was amplified to monstrous proportions in her desire to be acceptable to God....The prognosis for such cases in our own age is excellent; saintliness can often be completely cured.' 15. In the end, what do each of the characters gain as a result of their journey in pursuit of Sarah Canary ? Are the characters better off for their experience? 16. Why is the story of Sarah Canary narrated by someone of the late twentieth century? 17. One critic remarked that the characters in Sarah Canary are 'larger than life.' Are the characters in the book realistic? Which character did you relate to most? Whose perception of Sarah Canary is closest to your own? 18. One reviewer wrote, 'The author's message...is that at its core, America hasn't changed one whit since those rugged, lawless pioneer days [that serve as the setting for Sarah Canary ].' Do you agree? 19. Karen Joy Fowler is a cocreator of the James Tiptree Jr. Memorial Award, which is presented, in her words, 'to a short story or novel that explores or expands our understanding of gender...to remind the field of its own importance in the continual struggle to re-imagine more livable sexual roles for ourselves.'

        "Authors": "By Bailey, Edward P.",
        "Description": "In offices across America, the Masters of Gobbledygook are hard at work.  They're bombarding in-boxes with those long, confusing memos that colleagues don't have the patience to read--and bosses don't have the time to rewrite.  They use words like \"commence\" or  \"prior to\" instead of \"begin\" or \"before.\"  They bury their main point somewhere in the last paragraph--and take two pages to get there. Everybody knows one of them; in fact, you may even be one of them.  But now there's help for anyone who's ever fallen prey to businessese, academese, legalese, or any other \"ese\" when faced with a blank memo pad.      In The Plain English Approach to Business Writing, Edward Bailey--who spent twenty years working in the bastions of bureaucratese--offers readers a powerful new communications tool.  Written for busy professionals who want to improve the quality and clarity of their own (or their staff's) writing style, this no-nonsense guide is an indispensable office companion. Bailey's approach is 5urprisingly straightforward: just write as you would talk. Plain English is not only easier to read; it's also easier to write.  And it's so effective that many large organizations are endorsing, if not demanding, its use in the work place.  Pithy and entertaining, Bailey points out all the dos and don'ts of plain English.  He then illustrates them with examples drawn from a wide array of sources, including business documents, technical manuals, trade publications like Consumer Reports, and the works of writers such as Russell Baker and John D. MacDonald. From the basics to the fine tuning, he offers practical advice on clarity and precision, organization, layout, and a host of other important writing topics.      A delightful, down-to-earth guide, The Plain English Approach to Business Writing is for professionals of all backgrounds (government, military, legal, financial, technical, corporate) and staff at all levels (from the company CEO to the ambitious secretary).  The Plain English Approach to Business Writing can be read in an hour--and used for the rest of one's life.",

        "Description": "Read Jim Powell's blogs and other content on the Penguin Community. The Breaking of Eggs is the story of the curmudgeonly Feliks Zhokovski, Polish by birth, Communist at heart, who at age 61 finds that just about everything he has based his life on is crumbling. Separated from him family as a child when the Nazis invaded Poland, Feliks is currently living in Paris and his life's work is a travel guide to the old Eastern bloc. But unfortunately for Feliks, it's 1991: the Berlin Wall has fallen, Communism has collapsed, East Germany isn't the economic miracle he wants it to be, and he's forced to confront the fact that his travel-writing days are numbered. His guide was a flourishing business, but the old pro-Communist descriptions won\u2019t do, for Western visitors will now be able to see for themselves. So he makes the (extremely difficult) decision to sell his guide to a big, capitalist American publisher. This sets in motion a chain of events that will reunite him with a brother living in Ohio that he hasn't seen in fifty years, reveal the truth about the mother he thought abandoned him and offer him a second chance with a long-lost love.  Equal parts hilarious and moving, The Breaking of Eggs is the story of a man who closed himself off from everyone and everything years ago and now awakens to discover the world has changed dramatically and he must change with it. The Breaking of Eggs also has the added bonus of being a crash course in 20th century European history, subtly told as a backdrop to Feliks' riveting personal story. Imagine Everything is Illuminated meets The Elegance of the Hedgehog, then forget all the publishing clich\u00e9s and discover this incredible new voice.",

It is through the quieter, more skeptical Maple, a less than ardent Maoist whose father is languishing in prison for a minor crime, that we see this story to its tragic end.The Red Guards have branded Wild Ginger's deceased father a traitor and eventually drive her mother to a gruesome suicide, but she fervently embraces Maoism to save her spirit. She rises quickly through the ranks and is held up as a national model for Maoism. Wild Ginger now has everything, even a young man who vies for her heart. But Mao's prohibition on romantic love places her in an untenable position. Into this sexually charged situation steps Maple, creating an uneasy triangle that Min has portrayed with keen pychological insight and her characteristic gift for lyrical eroticism.In Anchee Min's previous three books she returned again and again to the devastating experience of the Cultural Revolution, which defined her youth. Here, in this slim but powerful novel, she gives us a moving story that goes closer to the core of that experience than anything she has written before, and brilliantly delineates the pychological and sexual perversion of those times. Ultimately, WILD GINGER has the clean lines of a parable, the poignancy of a coming-of-age novel, the sexiness of a French blue movie, and the sadness of a truly tragic love story.",

In Washington, acclaimed and award-winning author Fergus M. Bordewich turns his eye to the backroom deal making and shifting alliances between our Founding Fathers and in doing so pulls back the curtain on the lives of slaves who actually built the city. The answers revealed in this eye-opening book are not only surprising and exciting but also illuminate a story of unexpected triumph over a multitude of political and financial obstacles, including fraudulent real estate speculation, overextended financiers, and management more apt for a \"banana republic\" than an emerging world power. In this page-turning work that reveals the hidden and somewhat unsavory side of the nation's beginnings, Bordewich, once again, brings his novelist's sensibility to a little-known chapter in American history.",

Pleased as I was about how I brought the characters and their adventures to life in the pages of the magazines, I still wanted the reader to know more about my people and why they did what they did. So, over the years, I revised and expanded these magazine works into fuller-length novels that I published in paperback under other titles. \u00a0 \u201cThese particular early magazine versions of my books have long been a source of great speculation and curiosity among many of my readers, so much so of late, that I\u2019m now pleased to collect three of them in book form for the first time. \u00a0 \u201cI hope you enjoy them.\u201d",

        "Title": "On the Wings of Self Esteem",
        "Authors": "By Hart, Louise",
        "Description": "\"It seems as though humans have a reverse metamorphosis. We start out as beautiful butterflies, then are turned into ugly caterpillars. We spend the rest of our lives trying to remember and become the beautiful creatures we once were.\"So said a friend to Dr. Louise Hart several years ago. Struck with the poignancy of this observation, Dr. Hart decided to write a book that would help us become butterflies again. Her purpose is to help us recover and access the qualities that every human being possesses at birth: truthfulness, openness, curiosity, and creativity. The author explores three main stages of personal transformation: reaching in, reaching out, and reaching high. By engaging in these stages we learn to listen to ourselves, accept ourselves, set personal boundaries, and set goals. Reviews:  \"A wonderful book! It contains timeless insights, deep psychological truths presented in a simple yet profound way, and practical exercises you can begin to do today to create the quality of life you desire and deserve. If everyone in America read this book and did the recommended exercises, half of all the pain and suffering we currently experience would disappear.\"-Jack Canfield, co-author of Chicken Soup for the Soul\"Reflects practical wisdom based on a blending of compassion and experience. Here is a valuable book, indeed. A significant book on an important topic.\"  -Dan Millman, author of Way of the Peaceful Warrior\"I certainly didn't think such a little book would have such a big impact on my thoughts about myself and others, but it did! I've read a lot of things on self-esteem, and this was the first book which really helped me CHANGE my self-esteem.\"-Anonymous Amazon Reviewer\"On the Wings of Self-Esteem is an elegant little book that teaches about self-esteem: how it is lost, how to regain it, and how to keep it. Beautifully crafted and a pleasure to read. My clients love it!\"-Ani Liggett, Ph.D. Marriage and Family Therapist\"The best self-esteem book on the market. I have had at least 35 clients use this book. Every single one has loved it!\"-Ginger, therapist, Amazon Reviewer\"A wonderful collection of wisdom presented in simple lyrical language. Exactly what our society so desperately needs right now. This beautiful book soars, taking the reader to new heights of potential health. It makes a giant contribution that will help stamp out the alienation and anger in our culture. Should be required reading.\"-Dr. Patricia Palmer, therapist & author of Liking Myself; The Mouse, the Monster, and Me; Teen Esteem; I Wish I Could Hold Your Hand\"A wonderful book on self-esteem that is practical, uplifting and transforming.\"-Jerry Jampolsky, M.D., author of Love is Letting Go of Fear\"A little gem! Keep pushing the great treasure of self-esteem. May it infect everyone.\"-Patch Adams, M.D., Gesundheit Institute\"This is life-giving reading for anyone who wants to be authentic and free in living with integrity, personal power and grace. Louise Hart guides us in a self-empowering process to break through the cocoons that keep us victims of powerlessness, helping us to discover the wind for transformation beneath our wings.\"-Judith Cauley, Superintendent of the Diocese of Colorado Springs, CO\"This is one of the main books I use in my sociology class. This book gives my students opportunities to look at themselves, gain self-confidence, and approach the world in a more positive way.\"-Helen Meloy, Ph.D., California State University, Northridge\"Louise takes human potential from complexity to simplicity through a delightful metaphor.\"-Jim Malanowski, Ph.D., V.P. Performance Learning Systems\"For all of us who dream and aspire to be our best, but constantly battle self-destructive behaviors, Hart offers an action plan and gives hope that we will reach our maximum potential and become butterflies.\"-Dr. Deborah Livingston-White,  Director  of Special Education, East Detroit School District\"Self-esteem issues are often at the root of spiritual blockages. Dr. Hart's creative approach is filled with wisdom and beauty.\"-Joyce Rupp, International Retreat Director, author of Praying Our Goodbyes\"In my 22 years in law enforcement I have seen that lack of appropriate self-esteem is an important factor that weaves through the personality of virtually every person involved in criminal behavior. This book provides a roadmap that can be used at any point in one's life to enable a positive personal transformation.\"  -George Epp, Sheriff, Boulder CountyThis book blends the role of beliefs in early development with the hope of a deeper knowledge that underneath we are whole and healthy. It will help individuals understand that the self-esteem they have been looking for has been within them all along. It will be a real key to a healthy rebirth and a letting go of blame and guilt.\"-Barbara L. McComb, Ph.D., Senior Director, Motivation and Human Development, Mid-Continent Regional Educational Laboratory\"What a wonderful analogy of personal healing through metamorphosis. This book provided much needed exercises to develop your wings to freedom and to your self-esteem.\"-California Assemblyman John Vasconcellos\"A delightful book full of helpful exercises to develop your wings of self-esteem.\"-Joyful Child Magazine\"We applaud your courage to help awaken people to their own personal metamorphosis.\"-Marie Devlin, Friends of Creation  Spirituality\"This book is like getting a new pair of glasses.
