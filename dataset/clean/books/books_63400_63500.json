In twenty-six alliterative couplets, Steve Martin conjures up much more than mere apples and zebras. Instead we meet Horace the hare, whose hairdo hides hunchbacks, and Ollie the owl, who owed Owen an oboe. Roz Chast contributes the perfect visual settings for Martin\u2019s zany two-liners. Her instantly recognizable drawings are packed with humorous touches both broad and subtle. Each rereading\u2014and there will be many\u2014delivers new delights and discoveries. There, hidden behind Bad Baby Bubbleducks, is a framed picture of a beatnik holding balloons; and the letter C finds clunky Clarissa all clingy and clueless adrift in a landscape cluttered with images ranging from a curiously comfortable clown to Chuck\u2019s Chili stand. A smart, laugh-inducing introduction to the alphabet for young children, The Alphabet from A to Y with Bonus Letter Z! will also enchant adults with its matchless mix of the sophisticated and the silly.",

Still young, but already cynical and world-weary, he exemplifies the young men and women of the '20s, described by Fitzgerald as \"a generation grown up to find all gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken.\"",

Emma has it all mapped out: Go off the pill in December, have sex, get pregnant by January, have the baby in September. And with the help of a personal trainer, Emma figures she'll be back in shape by Christmas. Happy New Year!   But when three months of candle-scented sex fails to produce the desired result, Emma's life becomes a rollercoaster of post-coital handstands, hormone inducing (a.k.a. sanity reducing) drugs, and a veritable army of fertility specialists. Emma and James try everything, from ovulation kits to in-vitro, but all their carefully laid plans seem to go south -- in direct proportion to Emma's plummeting self-esteem. And just when Emma feels she's alienated everyone in her life -- her twice-pregnant confidante, her singleton friend, even her own husband -- events take a ninety-degree turn that will have unforeseen consequences for everyone.   With The Baby Trail Sinead Moriarty brings a wicked sense of humor to a subject of fevered concern for women today.

When Jane moves back to the sleepy Maine fishing community where she was born, it's to escape the seamy crime scenes and unsavory characters that crossed her path in Miami. Surely whatever crimes are committed in touristy, idyllic Green Haven wont involve anything as nasty as what she saw in Florida. It's a bit of a shock, then, when Nick Dow, the town drunk, turns up dead, and it's not the simple accident that everyone assumes it to be. Jane soon discovers that Dow wasnt even a drunk -- it was all an act. But why? And what does it have to do with a heated town hall meeting about fishing rights and paternity suits? The more Jane digs, the more confused she gets. Only two things are certain: Nothing is what it seems; and the whole town is in each other's business. But it's not until Jane impulsively hops on a boat with the killer -- a boat that suddenly heads out to sea -- that things become downright dangerous . . . As she proved in The Hungry Ocean, no one knows the sea like Linda Greenlaw. And as she proved in The Lobster Chronicles, no one has a better way with the telling details of Maine village life. This new mystery series features everything readers want: a great setting, wonderful characters, an authentic and original detective -- and a story that will keep them on the edge of their seats.",

        "Description": "Tushnet (constitutional law, Georgetown U. Law Center) analyzes the legal personalities and decisions of the US Supreme Court under Chief Justice Rehnquist. His overarching argument has to do why the Rehnquist court, to the dismay of the religious right, could generally be counted on to advance economic conservatism but simultaneously failed to roll back the cultural leftism unleashed by the Warren Court. His explanation distinguishes between new (Reagan/Goldwater) Republicans such as Scalia and Thomas and old Republicans such O'Connor and Souter, who tended not to join their Republican colleagues on such issues as abortion, affirmative action, and gay rights. In addition to examining these issues and explaining this dynamic, he profiles four of the justices in relation to signature issues: Clarence Thomas and constitutional \"originalism,\" Ruth Bader Ginsberg and gender discrimination; Antonin Scalia and the absolute First Amendment; and Anthony Kennedy and gay rights.

        "Authors": "By Randolph, Stephen P.",
        "Description": "As America confronts an unpredictable war in Iraq, Stephen Randolph returns to an earlier conflict that severely tested our civilian and military leaders. In 1972, America sought to withdraw from Vietnam with its credibility intact. As diplomatic negotiations were pursued in Paris, President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger hoped that gains on the battlefield would strengthen their position at the negotiating table--working against the relentless deadline of a presidential election year. In retaliation for a major North Vietnamese offensive breaking over the Easter holidays, the President launched the all-out air campaign known as Linebacker--overriding his Secretary of Defense and clashing with the theater commander in whom he had lost all confidence. He intended to destroy the enemy with the full force of America's \"powerful and brutal weapons\" and thus shape the endgame of the war. Randolph's narrative, based not only on the Nixon White House tapes and newly declassified materials from the National Security Council, the Pentagon, and the White House but also on never before used North Vietnamese sources, re-creates how North Vietnam planned and fought this battle from Hanoi and how the U.S. planned and fought it from Washington. Randolph's intimate chronicle of Nixon's performance as commander-in-chief gains us unprecedented access to how strategic assessments were made, transmitted through the field of command, and played out in combat and at the negotiating table. It is a compelling story about America's military decision-making in conflicts with nontraditional belligerents that speaks provocatively to our own time.",

Having demystified the equation, Bodanis explains its science and brings it to life historically, making clear the astonishing array of discoveries and consequences it made possible. It would prove to be a beacon throughout the twentieth century, important to Ernest Rutherford, who discovered the structure of the atom, Enrico Fermi, who probed the nucleus, and Lise Meitner, who finally understood how atoms could be split wide open.
