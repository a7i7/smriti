Creating and delivering a specific message based on observed performance is key to effective feedback. Your feedback should enable the receiver to walk away understanding exactly what he or she did and what impact it had on you. When the result is this specific and this direct, there is a better chance that the person getting the feedback will be motivated to begin, continue, or stop behaviors that affect performance. This guidebook explains how to deliver effective feedback by showing how to build your message, when to deliver it, and how to communicate it. By using the methods and examples in this guidebook, your feedback becomes a tool for development\u2014for others and for yourself.",

Nearly a decade ago, Levin began shooting photos of dogs (and occasionally cats) in and around Central Park. What began as a dog-loving photographer's hobby has blossomed into a successful career as a pet portrait artist nonpareil. With nine books of dog photos to her credit and a booming portrait business, Levin has become a virtual Avedon for the pet set.Pawfiles is filled with portraits by turns charming, touching, and goofy. Each dog's mini-portfolio is accompanied by its stats (age, breed, and home) and a short but revealing \"about the model\" statement. About Oliver, a 2-year-old English bulldog, we learn of a Beanie Baby obsession. Simone, a 7-year-old poodle, is described as \"airhead by day and tramp by night,\" and Max, a 12-year-old border collie, \"enjoys butt rubs\"--but, then, who doesn't?This hard-to-resist book is sure to elicit the same two-part response from all dog lovers: 1) I need this on my coffee table, and 2) My dog should be in the sequel.",

There, mother-daughter bakers Kaye and Liv Hansen turn out some of the most charming, refreshingly eccentric cakes ever to grace a birthday or wedding celebration.Kaye and Liv believe that a cake should taste as good as it looks, so they skip esoteric (and inedible) decorations in favor of simple buttercream, flavored whipped cream, and tinted candymaker\u2019s chocolate, covering their luscious cakes with amusing designs and gorgeous color that are easy to make and delicious to eat. The cakes themselves are no less enticing, pairing old-fashioned favorites like Banana Cake and Spice Cake with sumptuous fillings such as French Custard and Chocolate Mousse. Simple step-by-step lessons, illustrated with photographs, explain how to re-create Liv\u2019s charming chocolate designs, from the bright polka dots that shine against dark chocolate glaze to the shimmering stars that adorn the enchanting \u201cStarry Night.\u201d Templates for the delightful designs allow you to adapt these techniques to create your own unique decorations.With time-tested tips and complete information on everything from mixing colors to adjusting pan sizes, the Hansens explain all you need to know to get started.

Schuyler and Jack take up arms, only to realize that there is a much graver threat simmering in the Kingdom of the Dead. Meanwhile, determined to save the only vampire she still loves, Mimi has followed Kingsley Martin into Hell. With the help of her new human Conduit, Oliver Hazard-Perry, Mimi makes a bargain with the Queen of the Dead that she may soon regret. When the time comes to choose between love and revenge, both Mimi and Oliver will learn the true meaning of sacrifice.

Hugely popular in classrooms, colleges, and small offices, it's got word processing, graphics, database, web design, spreadsheet, and slide-show functions in a single, beautifully integrated application.Every year, AppleWorks arrives in the hands of four million Apple iMac and iBook buyers. There it sits on the hard drive, a masterpiece of smooth integration and clever interface design, accompanied by templates, art libraries, and fonts--and no printed instructions.AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual is the book that should have been in the box.It covers:What's new. The authors place special emphasis on easing the transition into the new AppleWorks 6 interface, its Internet hooks, the Starting Points window, and the new Presentation module.Part by part coverage.  The early chapters delve very deeply into the six core AppleWorks modules, including 85 pages on the word processor alone.Power tools.  Much of AppleWorks's power comes from its macros, templates, assistants, customizable Button bar, and web-based clip-art libraries.Document exchange.  AppleWorks 6 can no longer export Word and Excel files. But this book covers exchanging documents with other programs, versions, and platforms--and includes a 25% discount coupon for MacLink Plus, which restores the file-conversion feature.Troubleshooting.  Because this book isn't an Apple publication, the authors freely acknowledge the program's  weaknesses--and offer workarounds. Witty and jargon-free, AppleWorks 6:The Missing Manual treats AppleWorks as the serious productivity tool it is. With over 250 illustrations, a 2,000-entry index, and a menu-by-menu explanation of every command, AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual is as smoothly put together as AppleWorks itself.",
