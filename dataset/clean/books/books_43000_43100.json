        "Description": "A positive look at how talking computers, VIVOs, will make text/written language obsolete, replace all writing and reading with speech and graphics, democratize information flow worldwide, and recreate an oral culture by 2050. Text is an ancient technology for storing and retrieving information; VIVOs will do the same job more quickly, efficiently, and universally. Among VIVO\u2019s potential benefits: 80% of the world\u2019s people are functionally nonliterate; they will be able to use VIVOs to access all information without having to learn to read and write. VIVO\u2019s instantaneous translation function will let people speak with other people around the world using their own native languages. People whose disabilities prevent them from reading and/or writing will be able to access all information. Four \u201cengines\u201d are driving us irreversibly into the VIVO Age and oral culture: human evolution, technological breakthroughs, young people\u2019s rejection of text, and people\u2019s demand for textless, universal access to information. Future generations, using eight key VIVOlutionary learning skills, will radically change education, human relations, politics, the arts, business, our relation to the environment, and even human consciousness itself. Worldwide access to VIVO technology looms as a key human rights issue of the 21st Century.",

But don't women love men too much already? No, says Sills. Women have needed men too much, made them too important in our lives, and that got in the way of loving men and of feeling loved.The path to love is not about finding the right man, fixing the one you've already found, or trading him in for someone better.It's about recognizing the emotional reactions - the fantasies, the wishful thinking, the fear, the rage - that suffocate our feelings of love. It's about stretching love to include his less lovable self, instead of withholding love until he deserves it. Get to love not by changing the man, but by changing the eyes through which you see him - not for the sake of his happiness, but for your own.",

        "Authors": "By Ladd, Everett Carll",
        "Description": "The U.S. economy has passed through one of the longest and most impressive booms in its history. We are enjoying our highest standard of living ever, buoyed by low crime and an improving environment. Still, we worry that, in other important ways, we're losing ground as a society. In particular, social commentators are bemoaning the state of our communities. Is our civic engagement declining even amidst material well-being? Do we no longer join together, care about each other, and trust one another as we once did?  Everett Carll Ladd, a political scientist who directs the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, uses a vast array of data to offer a definitive report on the state of America's civic life. He shows that, far from withering, civic life is thriving.  Participation in community affairs has dramatically increased. You might be surprised, considering most media portrayals, to learn that:   The national PTA has declined, but overall parent-teacher involvement has soared, and more parents report spending more time than ever with their kids' schooling.  The Sierra Club and Audubon Society have grown fourfold since 1970.  A rich variety of new community churches find their membership burgeoning. Despite the decline of mainline denominations, more people attend church now than ever before.  Levels of charitable giving have been climbing steadily in real terms for more than a half century.  Volunteer rates are up significantly. For all the time-squeeze on two-wage-earner families and the allure of television sitcoms, a record number of Americans now do volunteer work.   If you are wondering how to organize your own community, or how you can pitch in, or simply want to know what all the doomsayers are talking about, then The Ladd Report is for you. Here is an essential guide that will answer every argument and remind us all how right Tocqueville was when he described America as a \"nation of joiners.\"",

Pern: where dragons' flaming breath burns Thread out of the sky before it can drop on the helpless land below. Pern: where harper songs warn of Thread, record history, and prepare for the future. The harpers are the glue that holds the people of Pern together; and no man is more influential than the Masterharper of Pern.The son of Petiron, renowned composer, and Merelan, one of Pern's most gifted singers, Robinton is a prodigy from birth. As a child, he is already composing music that the apprentice and journeyman harpers play with delight. And he also discovers another gift: he has the ability to speak with the dragons, who tend to reach out telepathically only to their riders.But not everyone appreciates his talents. His own father, driven by jealousy, spurns the boy. And far to the north, in the High Reaches, trouble is brewing in the form of a despotic holder, Fax, who hates harpers in general - and Robinton in particular.It is a perilous time for harpers. They sing of Thread, yet more and more people are beginning to doubt the return of that deadly scourge. They teach reading, writing, and history, yet Fax is determined to keep his growing area of influence free of the learning that might sow unrest. And they extol the dragonriders, whom many view, increasingly as a drain on the resources of the Holds. Now harpers are being turned away from holds; and, worse yet, they are being derided, attacked, even beaten.It is in this climate of unrest that Robinton will come into his own. For despite the tragedies that beset his own life, he continues to believe in music and in the dragons, and he is determined to save his beloved Pern from itself...so that the dragonriders can be ready to fly against the dreaded Thread when at last it returns!",

Not since her childhood has she lived in an almost black environment, and she is surprised at the obsession her new friends have with the white world around them. She stays for a while with John and Grace Killens and begins to read her writing at the Harlem Writers Guild. She continues to sing, most notably at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem, but more and more she begins to take part in the struggle of black Americans for their rightful place in the world. She helps organize a benefit cabaret for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and then is appointed Martin Luther Kings Northern Coordinator.Shortly after that, through her friend Abbey Lincoln, she takes one of the lead parts in Genet's The Blacks (it was a remarkable cast, including Godfrey Cambridge, Roscoe Lee Brown, James Earl Jones, Cicely Tyson, Raymond St. Jacques, and Lou Gossett), and even writes music for the production.In the meantime her personal life has taken a tempestuous turn. She has left the New York bail bondsman she was intending to marry and has fallen in love with a South African freedom fighter named Vusumzi Make, who sweeps her off her feet and eventually takes her to London and then to Cairo, where, as her marriage begins to break up, she becomes the first female editor of the English-language magazine.The Heart of a Woman is filled with unforgettable vignettes of famous people, from Billie Holiday to Malcolm X, but perhaps most important is the story of Maya Angelou's relationship with her son. Because this book chronicles, finally, the joys and the burdens of a black mother in America and how the son she had cherished so intensely and worked for so devotedly finally grows to be a man.",

        "Description": "The descendants of the Elven house of Shannara had all completed their quests. Walker Boh, using the power of the Black Elfstone, had restored the lost Druid's Keep, Paranor, and become the last Druid himself. Wren had found the missing Elves and brought them back from the island of Morrowindl to the Four Lands. Now she was Queen of the Elves. And Par had found what quite possibly was the legendary Sword of Shannara.But their work was not yet done - the Shadowen still swarmed over the Four Lands, poisoning all with their dark magic. And the leader of the Shadowen, Rimmer Dall, was determined that the scions of Shannara would not share with each other the knowledge that would end the sickness. Against Walker Boh then, he would dispatch the Four Horsemen. To Wren Elessedil, he would send a friend who would betray her. And for Par Ohmsford, whose wishsong was growing steadily more uncontrollable, he had devised the most terrible fate of all...The charges given by the shade of the Druid Allanon were doomed to fail - unless the Shannara children could escape the traps being laid for them, and Par could find a way to use the Sword of Shannara.Here, in the final volume of his bestselling series, THE HERITAGE OF SHANNARA, Terry Brooks tells of the culmination of the struggle between a handful of determined heroes and the insidious, pervasive evil that seeks to crush them.",

Looking for a new world to call their own, they brought with them a rich m\u00e9lange of cultures, religions, and dialects from a far-off planet called Earth. Mighty were the old-fathers, with the power to shape the world to their liking---but that was many generations ago, and what was once known has long been lost. Steamboats and gas-filled blimps now traverse the planet, where people once looked up to see great silver cities in the sky.Like his world, John deBrun has forgotten more than he remembers. Twenty-seven years ago, he washed up onto the shore of Nanagada with no memory of his past. Although he has made a new life for himself among the peaceful islanders, his soul remains haunted by unanswered questions about his own identity.These mysteries take on new urgency when the fearsome Azteca storm over the Wicked High Mountains in search of fresh blood and hearts to feed their cruel, inhuman gods. Nanagada\u2019s only hope lies in a mythical artifact, the Ma Wi Jung, said to be hidden somewhere in the frozen north. And only John deBrun knows the device\u2019s secrets, even if he can\u2019t remember why or how!Crystal Rain is the much-anticipated debut novel by one of science fiction\u2019s newest and most promising talents.",

On the far fringes of the Isles, ancient powers ready themselves for a titanic struggle in which human beings are mere pawns--or fodder!Reptilian and insect monsters from out of the ages march on the kingdom, commanded by wizards no longer human or never human at all. If unchecked, their ravening slaughter will sweep over the Isles as destructively as a flood of lava. Garric, ripped from his time and body, must make new allies if he and his kingdom are to survive.His sister Sharina struggles with the chaos threatening the kingdom as swords and wizardry both gather to bring it down.Their friend Cashel, thrown into a place not of his world, faces each succeeding challenge with the calm certainty that he will overcome it or die, and that nothing yet has been able to kill him.And while her comrades strive in their own fashions, Ilna studies a pattern more complex than perhaps than even she and the skills she learned in Hell can master. If she fail, humanity will never escape the web being woven for it.Watching them all from the blackness of a tomb walled off in time and space, the Mistress waits...And her fangs drip poison!",

        "Description": "Ten years ago, Kate Braestrup and her husband Drew were enjoying the life they shared together. They had four young children, and Drew, a Maine state trooper, would soon begin training to become a minister as well. Then early one morning Drew left for work and everything changed. On the very roads that he protected every day, an oncoming driver lost control, and Kate lost her husband.   Stunned and grieving, Kate decided to continue her husband's dream and became a minister herself. And in that capacity she found a most unusual mission: serving as the minister on search and rescue missions in the Maine woods, giving comfort to people whose loved ones are missing, and to the wardens who sometimes have to deal with awful outcomes.  Whether she is with the parents of a 6-year-old girl who had wandered into the woods, with wardens as they search for a snowmobile rider trapped under the ice, or assisting a man whose sister left an infant seat and a suicide note in her car by the side of the road, Braestrup provides solace, understanding, and spiritual guidance when it's needed most.   HERE IF YOU NEED ME is the story of Kate Braestrup's remarkable journey from grief to faith to happiness. It is dramatic, funny, deeply moving, and simply unforgettable, an uplifting account about finding God through helping others, and the tale of the small miracles that occur every day when life and love are restored.",

        "Description": "There are vineyards producing the finest wine, and miles of wild mountain scenery; almost any view will take in other villages, clustering around the upper reaches of some hill or the russet roofs of a fortified town deep in a valley. Tuscany has its grand cities\u2014Florence and Siena\u2014but their distinctive elegance is found on a more intimate scale in numerous small towns and villages.There is a richness in these small places, of architecture and artistic life, which lends them an interest and complexity shared by no other rural communities in Europe. Their sense of civilization is deep and ancient, but it is the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance which have left their mark, tempting travelers and settlers from abroad from the time of the Grand Tour to the present day. Here is the village of Settignano, where Michelangelo lived and which also boasts the glorious Renassiance garden of the Villa Gamberaia. Piero della Francesca's lovely Madonna del Parto decorates the tiny cemetery chapel of Monterchi. The medieval towers of San Gimignano loom over the town's squares and streets like the backdrop to some surreal stage set.James Bentley has chosen thirty-seven villages and small towns, both for their intrinsic beauty and for the part they have played in Tuscan history and culture. Page after page of Hugh Palmer's magnificent color photographs evoke the beauty and the wonder of this land. For the visitor, there are specially compiled listings of hotels, restaurants, and festivals to complete the tribute to Tuscany and its villages.",

        "Title": "From Cradle to Grave: The Human Face of Poverty in America",
        "Authors": "By Freedman, Jonathan",
        "Description": "In this eloquent and revealing book, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jonathan Freedman offers the first comprehensive view of poverty in a generation, showing us beyond the shadow of any possible doubt that the poor are no longer confined to some Other America or so-called \"underclass.\" Drawing on the true stories of people at every stage of life - infancy, childhood, adolescence, the family, midlife, aging, and dying - he has written a singular book about hardship, about courage, and, in the face of incalculable odds, considerable hope.To do so, Freedman went to the people who have been shunned, visiting prenatal clinics, schools, job-training centers, and nursing homes, he asked, \"What helps, what hurts, what works?\" Their responses give poverty a recognizable human face, as he shows us children struggling to grow up, families fighting to keep their homes, displaced workers seeking training, retirees struggling to age and die with dignity.In his three years of investigating and recording, Freedman also discovered a surprising and, in many cases, heartening number of individuals and organizations already working to eliminate suffering. It is one of this book's achievements to show how innovative programs, funded on shoestring budgets, can help seemingly hopeless people cope with tribulation and transform their lives. Building on lessons from all parts of the country, Freedman suggests further coherent solutions that are affordable in this deficit-conscious era.A major work of reportage, From Cradle to Grave is also a timely, deeply informed call for change.",

But after her parents divorced, leaving her a lonely only child ferrying between two worlds that only seemed to grow further apart, Rebecca was no longer sure what she represented. In this book, Rebecca Leventhal Walker attempts to define herself as a soul instead of a symbol&#151and offers a new look at the challenge of personal identity, in a story at once strikingly unique and truly universal.",

        "Title": "MySQL Cookbook",
        "Authors": "By Dubois, Paul",
        "Description": "While MySQL has turned up among high profile users such as Yahoo!, NASA and the U.S. Census Bureau, the rising popularity of this open source database is especially keen among users with little database experience. These days, even a small organization or web site has uses for a database, and MySQL is an obvious choice. Affordable and easy to use, MySQL packs the power, speed and efficiency that enable it to rival expensive, proprietary database solutions. Yet, even if you know the basics, anyone without practical MySQL experience--novices and skilled DBAs alike--might stumble over common database-related tasks. Fortunately, there's a sensible shortcut.MySQL Cookbook provides a unique problem-and-solution format that offers practical examples for everyday programming dilemmas. For every problem addressed in the book, there's a worked-out solution or \"recipe\"--short, focused pieces of code that you can insert directly into your applications. But MySQL Cookbook is more than a collection of cut-and-paste code. You also get explanations of how and why the code works, so you can learn to adapt the techniques to similar situations.The book covers a lot of ground. Solutions for typical MySQL dilemmas range from simple ways to find all records that contain a given string, to more difficult problems, such as finding matching/non-matching records in two tables. Whether you use MySQL on Unix, Linux, Windows or the Mac OS X platform, the book will show you how to:Import data from external sourcesExport data for use by external programsAccess MySQL from your web serverUse scripts with MySQL to read queries from a fileAccess MySQL from within client programs that use Perl, PHP, Java, Python and other languagesConstruct queries that solve commonly-occurring questionsInteract with the serverThis learn-as-you-go resource will help users of all levels exploit MySQL more fully. MySQL Cookbook supplies you with an armory of ready-made techniques for specific problems so that, even if you're an experienced MySQL user, you don't have to write everything from scratch.",
