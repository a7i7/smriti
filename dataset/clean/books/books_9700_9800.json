        "Title": "A Better Woman: A Memoir of Motherhood",
        "Authors": "By Johnson, Susan",
        "Description": "If I had known...what giving birth was to cost me,  would I have dared to fall pregnant?  Yes, yes. A thousand times, yes.  Accalaimed novelist Susan Johnson found, at age thirty-five, that her arms began to feel \"empty.\" Soon her desire to have a baby became overwhelming. She had no inkling then what motherhood would cost her -- or give her. But as she went on to experience pregnancy and birth, and their impact on her marriage, her health, and her heart, she recorded it all in a black-and-red notebook. Here, Susan Johnson takes that raw, potentially wrenching material and creates an inspirational work of autobiography.  In a hauntingly lovely account, Johnson portrays a woman transformed by motherhood, and a writer forever changed by a widening chasm of experience. Simple acts such as getting her newborn to breastfeed prove unexpectedly difficult. The husband she adores becomes a sparring partner, their newly purchased home a disaster, her time to write nonexistent. Then, just when she believes she may be getting her life together, she becomes pregnant again.  Soon ecstasy jostles against bewilderment, rage, and despair when she develops a rare complication of childbirth. Facing major surgery, Susan calls herself \"a one-woman catastrophe, a small ruined country.\" She is also going to bed at night planning what she will write in the morning, burning to get words on paper.  The mesmerizing narrative she created is A Better Woman, a chronicle of love and courage, by turns poetic and searingly graphic. It should be required reading for every woman hungry to give birth -- and every mother yearning to have her deepest feeling heard.",

A public opinion pollster for twenty years, author David W. Moore includes profiles of Shere Hite, author of The Hite Report, the groundbreaking and controversial work on sexuality; George Gallup, the man who broke polling practice with his 1936 prediction of Hoover's defeat and FDR's victory, the man who pioneered modern polling practices; Lou Harris, JFK's pollster, the first of the television pollsters; Pat Caddell, the man responsible first for George McGovern's, and then for Jimmy Carter's, surprise capture of the Democratic presidential nomination; Robert Teeter, pollster for Nixon, Ford, and past and current pollster for President George Bush; Richard Wirthlin, pollster for Ronald Reagan; Mervin Field, head of the California Poll; and many others.Personal advisors to the candidates, pollsters often have tremendous influence on what the top politicians say, and how they say it. Here, too, is the lively history of polling. Its increasing sophistication parallels the growing complexity of our national political scene, from its rough origins to the present day, when the pollsters--and less frequently, the voters themselves--make or break a candidate.",

        "Description": "There was a wooden picnic table under the grape arbor, where Zelma sat all day when she wasn't actively gardening. She shelled peas, wrote letters, and mended clothes there. The older she got, she said, the less she wanted to be inside. Following Zelma's model, I will age ungracefully until I become an old woman in a small garden, doing whatever the hell I want. There was a time when this would have sounded unfulfilled to me, if not downright depressing, but now I look forward to it. Robin Chotzinoff From the Introduction",

        "Authors": "By Safran, Nadav",
        "Description": "Through thirty turbulent years, the United States has been deeply enmeshed in Israel's destiny. Seldom in the history of international relations has such a world power been involved so intensely for so long with such a small power. How this phenomenon came to pass and how it will affect the future are explained in this compelling history of Israel and its relations with the United States\u2014from the 1947 United Nations resolution through Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy to Carter's peace campaign.To form the backdrop for this extraordinary relationship, Nadav Safran paints a detailed portrait of the historical forces that combined to create the Jewish state. He unfolds panel after panel of Israeli life\u2014its physical environment, people, economy, politics, and religion. He examines Israel's responses to the many security crises it has faced since becoming a nation, and presents a clear and thorough exposition of its defense strategy and descriptions of all its wars.Safran then presents his brilliant analysis of Israel and America in international politics. Cutting through the tangle of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, the East\u2013West struggle, the disagreement among Western powers, the conflicts within and among the Arab states, and the impact of special interest groups in the United States on its foreign policy, Safran deftly pursues fluctuations in the American\u2013Israeli relationship as it moved from simple friendship to an alliance of friends. A concluding chapter recapitulates the highlights of that evolution and projects its relevance for the future of the Middle East and American\u2013Israeli relations.",

        "Authors": "By Eldredge, Niles",
        "Description": "In Life in the Balance, Niles Eldredge argues that the Earth is confronting a disaster in the making--an ecological crisis that, if left unresolved, could ultimately lead to mass extinction on the scale of that which killed the dinosaurs sixty-five million years ago. Writing for general readers, he reviews compelling evidence for this \"biodiversity crisis,\" showing that species are dying out at an unnaturally rapid rate. He demonstrates the importance of maintaining biodiversity, taking the reader on a journey that reveals the twin faces of biodiversity--over thirteen million living species and the ecosystems through which these species transform the sun's energy into life-sustaining matter. Throughout, Eldredge shows how our own fate is intricately linked with that of other species. Eldredge, one of the world's foremost paleontologists, begins by taking us to the heart of Botswana's Okavango Delta, considered by many to be among the last \"Edens\" left on Earth--a place where a rich assortment of organisms exist in natural equilibrium. However, it is also a place where the results of human activity--pollution, clear-cutting, water-diversion, encroaching agriculture, disease--now pose the same ecological threats that, on a worldwide scale, put the entire planet at risk. Eldredge then leads us on a fascinating exploration of the Earth's organisms--animals, plants, fungi, the microbes that underpin all life--and of the diverse ecosystems from the tundra to the tropics in which these organisms live. It is a journey that demonstrates the inherent value of the millions of species and ecosystems on Earth, and the importance of biodiversity to the entire biosphere and to humans' continued existence. Eldredge concludes that humans not only are responsible for the biodiversity crisis but also hold the key to preventing an impending Sixth Extinction. He argues that we must, among other strategies, pledge ourselves to sustainable development and the conservation of wild places. An eloquent and passionate account by one of today's leading scientists, Life in the Balance will draw new attention to one of the most pressing problems now facing the world. In this book, Eldredge explores the same themes that illuminate The American Museum of Natural History's new Hall of Biodiversity, for which he is Scientific Curator. The Hall is scheduled to open in spring 1998.",

Jane acknowledges: 'I had thought it was all right to marry someone I didn't love, but what I hadn't counted on was how it felt to share someone I loved with someone I didn't.' Discuss the nature of Jane and Mitch's marriage and the impact Olivia's birth had on it. 3. How does motherhood change Jane's life? 4. Discuss Jane's socioeconomic background and its impact on her. Would you agree or disagree that class mobility in the United States takes a toll that is not always acknowledged or discussed? 5. How does Jane's image of herself correspond (or not) with how others perceive her? 6. Lucy's aunt has a very different perspective on Lucy that contrasts sharply with Jane's worshipful remembrance.

        "Description": "Rebecca Wells's wonderful third book in her Ya-Ya trilogy, which includes Little Altars Everywhere and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, is sure to provide reading that makes you laugh and cry, a book that will break your heart and mend it again. Ya-Yas in Bloom reveals the roots of the Ya-Yas' friendship in the 1930s, following Vivi, Teensy, Caro and Necie through sixty years of marriage, child-raising, and hair-raising family secrets. When four-year-old Teensy Whitman prisses one time too many and stuffs a big old pecan up her nose, she sets off the chain of events that lead Vivi, Teensy, Caro, and Necie to become true sister-friends. Using as narration the alternating voices of Vivi and the Petite Ya-Yas, Siddalee and Baylor Walker, as well as other denizens of Thornton, Louisiana, Wells show us the Ya-Yas in love and at war with convention. Through crises of faith and hilarious lapses of parenting skills, brushes with alcoholism and glimpses of the dark reality of racial bigotry, the Ya-Ya values of unconditional loyalty, high style, and Louisiana sass shine through. But in the Ya-Yas' inimitable way, these four remarkable women also teach their children about the Mysteries: the wonder of snow in the deep South, the possibility that humans are made of stars, and the belief that miracles do happen. And they need a miracle when old grudges and wounded psyches lead to a heartbreaking crime...and the dynamic web of sisterhood is the only safety net strong enough to hold families together and endure. After two bestsellers and a blockbuster movie, the Ya-Yas have become part of American culture -- icons for the power of women's friendship. Ya-Yas in Bloom continues the saga, giving us more Ya-Ya lore, spun out in the rich patois of the Louisiana bayou country and brim full of the Ya-Ya message to embrace life and each other with joy.",

        "Title": "Cults: Faith, Healing, and Coercion",
        "Authors": "By Galanter, Marc",
        "Description": "From the mass weddings of Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church to the mass suicides at Jonestown, charismatic cults and their devotees have become facts of American life.  Once exotic offshoots of the Sixties counterculture exciting suspicion, scorn, terror, and counter-terror (as in the brief vogue of \"deprogrammers\"), cults have grown so common and entered so many areas of public life--managing everything from roadside flower-sellers to major metropolitan newspapers and nation-wide political campaigns--that only spectacular disasters like the immolation of the Philadelphia cult MOVE seem to remind us how extraordinary their burgeoning really is.  Using material gleaned from fifteen years of direct encounters with cults and their detractors, as well as a wide range of his quantitative research, Marc Galanter shows not only how cult members feel and think at all stages of their involvement but also how larger social and psychological forces interact within the cults to command and reinforce individual commitment.  After examining the powerful combination of social cohesiveness, shared beliefs, and altered consciousness that cults offer potential recruits, Galanter shows how these forces are orchestrated into self-contained social systems that relieve anxiety within while warding off threats--real or imagined--from without. Finally, he demonstrates this basic system in action, both in apparently successful movements like the Unification Church and in catastrophic failures such as MOVE and Jim Jones's People's Temple, and reflects on how and why some groups turn to violence.  The book is full of compelling stories--first-person accounts of conversions, daily life under the rule of charismatic leaders, disillusionments, and departures both voluntary and forced--and fascinating overviews of many of the most influential cults, including the most comprehensive psychological analysis ever published of the evolution of the \"Moonies.\"  Many of Galanter's findings, especially his account of the similarities between cults and \"zealous\" self-help movements, are highly controversial, and his discussion of the powerful influence that Alcoholics Anonymous exerts over its members will spark much debate.  Moving beyond the expos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds and confessions that have characterized so much of the literature on this subject, Galanter offers the most extensive psychological analysis of cults available. Although based on extensive on-site research, it is immediately accessible to both the general reader and to anyone personally or professionally concerned with cults.",

        "Description": "Drawing on stays made over a half-dozen years, Paul Rambali - a natural storyteller with a sharp eye for contradiction - dissolves the sugarcoating common to travel writing on Brazil. Carnaval and Copacabana take a backseat as Rambali propels us on a wild-side walk through this enigmatic nation on the brink.Tracing back the abundant miseries of the Brazilians, Rambali goes from Third World megalopolis to virgin rain forest, where he is confronted with hard and perhaps irreconcilable truths about our drive to build cities, and our romance with the jungle.Here is a country where gunmen are hired to get rid of the orphans who live homeless at the feet of luxury high-rises; where an illiterate population gets its news from TV soaps; where animist religion - Macumba - pervades everything, but an evangelical church, waging \"holy war\" against it, collects millions from destitute true believers, where gangsters provide shantytowns with everything from electricity to law and order.Here is the last frontier of the New World, where greed, ambition, and folly are the circumstances of daily life.In prose that is vivid, impressionistic, and occasionally novelistic, Paul Rambali captures Brazil's vitality even as he reveals its manifold paradoxes and absurdities. The result is an unsettling account of paradise lost, by a writer whose genuine affection for his subject never clouds the sharp truth of his vision.",

En route we visit the backroads, rural hills, and railway crossings where Doc Watson, Sara Carter, Bill Monroe, Ralph Stanley, and Jimmie Rodgers (The Father of Country Music) first learned to play their guitars, fiddles, and mandolins.Nicholas Dawidoff has traveled to the places where country music first emerged and talked to the musicians, writers, and singers who created this deceptively simple-worded, string-driven, melodic music. Here are indelible portraits of Johnny Cash, behind whose black apparel lies a Faustian dilemma between fame and creativity; Merle Haggard, a man as elusive as he is gifted; Patsy Cline, who would happily curl her girlfriends' hair as she curled their ears with her sailor's mouth; and Harlan Howard, the king of country songwriters.Inherent in Dawidoff's chronicle is a critique of contemporary country music - the pop/rock hybrid known as Hot Country that often stands in sharp contrast to the spirit of old-time country music. In the Country of Country is a book full of wonderful stories that together reveal an underappreciated piece of American culture.",

        "Authors": "By Burkett, Larry",
        "Description": "\"This book is not meant to be merely an investment guide for retirees (or those approaching retirement), but rather a comprehensive handbook for retirees, present and future. To be sure, if you fail to plan financially, retirement can be a frustrating and fearful time. But the best financial planning in the world done in the nineties may be worthless in the twenty-first century if you don't take into account future health care costs, inflation, the economy, taxes, and so on. Therefore, I will try to help you think through each of these areas and make the best decisions possible as you approach retirement age. But more important, it is my desire that you understand how to evaluate future change for yourself and adjust accordingly.\"This book is meant to be a handbook for the plethora of decisions you must make, such as whether to buy more life insurance, purchase nursing home insurance, use a living trust, or prepay funeral expenses. The decisions you must make between now and the year 2000 are critical. But again I emphasize that the best any person can do is give good advice. Only God can give true wisdom.\"",
