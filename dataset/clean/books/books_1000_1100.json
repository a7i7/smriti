        "Description": "A luminous, poignant true story, Alison Smith's stunning first book, Name All the Animals, is an unparalleled account of grief and secret love: the tale of a family clinging to the memory of a lost child, and a young woman struggling to define herself in the wake of his loss.As children, siblings Alison and Roy Smith were so close that their mother called them by one name: Alroy. But on a cool summer morning when Alison was fifteen, she woke to learn that Roy, eighteen, was dead. This is Smith's extraordinary account of the impact of that loss -- on herself, on her parents, and on a deeply religious community.At home, Alison and her parents sleepwalk in shifts. Alison hoards food for her lost brother, hides in the backyard fort they built together, and waits for him to return. During the day, she breaks every rule at Our Lady of Mercy School for Girls, where the baffled but loving nuns offer prayer, Shakespeare, and a job running the switchboard. In the end, Alison finds her own way to survive: a startling and taboo first love that helps her discover a world beyond the death of her brother.An intimate book written in clear-eyed prose, Name All the Animals announces a brilliant new writer with a keen insight into the emotional life of the American family, the power of sibling love and loyalty, and the excruciating joy of first, forbidden love. Smith tells the story through her own fifteen-year-old eyes, with such expert pacing and narrative suspense that readers will find the book hard to put down.Heartbreaking but hopeful, this is ultimately a book less about loss than it is about love -- about the excitement and anguish of Alison's first love, about her parents' enduring romance, about a community's passion for its faith, and about a well-loved boy who dies too young. A fiercely beautiful, redemptive book, it is sure to be a classic.",

        "Description": "Nearly three years have passed since that tragic day in September. Since then, our wounds have healed, but our senses and memories have dulled.At first, the nation rallied behind its leader. But by the time the confrontation with Iraq presented itself, our courage and moral certainty seemed to fade in the face of partisan bickering and posturing.Now the political left and the Democratic Party are trying to use the demanding aftermath of the war to exploit our national cause for their own political advantage.How could we allow ourselves to forget so soon?--from Deliver Us from EvilSean Hannity's first blockbuster book, the New York Times bestseller Let Freedom Ring, cemented his place as the freshest and most compelling conservative voice in the country. As the host of the phenomenally successful Hannity & Colmes on the Fox News Channel and The Sean Hannity Show on ABC Radio, Hannity has won a wildly devoted fan base. Now he brings his plainspoken, take-no-prisoners style to the continuing War on Terror abroad -- and liberalism at home -- in Deliver Us from Evil.\"Evil exists,\" Hannity asserts. \"It is real, and it means to harm us.\" And in these pages he revisits the harsh lessons America has learned in confronting evil in the past and the present, to illuminate the course we must take in the future. Tracing a direct line from Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin through Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, he reminds us of the courage and moral clarity of our great leaders. And he reveals how the disgraceful history of appeasement has reached forward from the days of Neville Chamberlain and Jimmy Carter to corrupt the unrepentant leftists of the modern Democratic Party -- from Howard Dean and John Kerry to Bill and Hillary Clinton. As Americans face the ongoing war against terrorists and their state sponsors around the world, Sean Hannity reminds us that we must also cope with the continuing scourge of accommodation and cowardice at home. With his trademark blend of passion and hard-hitting commentary, he urges Americans to recognize the dangers of putting our faith in toothless \"multilateralism\" when the times call for decisive action. For only through strong defense of our freedoms, at home and around the world, can we preserve America's security and liberty in the dangerous twenty-first century.",

        "Title": "The New York Public Library's Books of the Century",
        "Authors": "By New York Public Library (COR), Diefendorf, Elizabeth (EDT), and Bryan, Diana (ILT)",
        "Description": "What are the books that helped shape and define the last hundred years? This was the question put to the librarians of The New York Public Library as part of the Library's 100th anniversary celebration. Which books had influenced the course of events for good or ill? Which interpreted new worlds? Or delighted millions of readers? Their answers to these questions formed \"Books of the Century,\" a highly popular exhibit during the Library's centennial celebration (1895 to 1995), highlighting an exhilarating collection of important works by some of the greatest writers of our times.     Now, the companion volume, The New York Public Library's Books of the Century takes readers on a thought-provoking tour of the last hundred years, through the medium of the printed word. Here readers will find over 150 pivotal works organized into topical categories, reflecting themes that have informed the century, among them \"Mind & Spirit,\" \"Protest & Progress,\" \"Women Rise,\" or \"Nature's Realm.\" Each is introduced with a brief commentary illuminating the themes and issues the books in that section address, followed by an annotation for each title offering a brief description and a key to its significance.  The range of books is remarkable, embracing Chekhov's Three Sisters and Bram Stoker's Dracula, as well as Galbraith's The Affluent Society and Durkheim's Suicide, or Timothy Leary's The Politics of Ecstasy and W.E.B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk. Readers will find many illuminating juxtapositions. In \"Utopias & Dystopias,\" for instance, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Peter Pan, and Lost Horizon are in the unexpected company of Nineteen Eighty-four, A Clockwork Orange, Brave New World, and The Time Machine. The century's darkest moments are mirrored in \"War, Holocaust, Totalitarianism,\" where we find Koestler's Darkness at Noon, Hersey's Hiroshima, Anne Frank's Diary, and Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. But the volume ends on a happier note, with \"Optimism, Joy, Gentility,\" and such wonderful works as Helen Keller's The Story of My Life, Shaw's Pygmalion, Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon, and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.      Illustrated throughout with imaginative paper cut-out murals by artist Diana Bryan, The New York Public Library's Books of the Century is a reflection of our times, featuring both the books we love--whether The Cat in the Hat or Ulysses--and books like The Surgeon General's Report or Mein Kampf that, for better or worse, have been an inescapable part of our century. \"For 100 years, the librarians of The New York Public Library have shared our passion for books with a diverse and literate public,\" said curator and editor Elizabeth Diefendorf. \"That experience has given us a unique perspective in making our choices for the books of the century. We hoped that visitors to the exhibition, and now the readers of this book, will be drawn into our choices and reflect on what their own selections would be.\"",

        "Description": "Brilliant inspiration from some of our most renowned and respected fiction writers on the craft of writing and the writing life. \"Abandon the idea that you are ever going to finish . . . write just one page for each day. . . . Never correct or rewrite until the whole thing is down,\" instructs John Steinbeck. \"When your interest is engaged, i.e., in the sounds and smells of your city, you write admirably. But until these details become the envelope of a clear and legible emotion, ambition, or dilemma, the reader's interest, while respectful, will be to some extent merely polite,\" writes John Updike to Nicholas Delbanco. Andre Dubus reflects, \"I learned from Hemingway to stop each day's work in mid-sentence, while it is still going well, then to exercise the body, and not to think about the story till you go to your desk each day.\" Tobias Wolff muscles a student who does not take his craft or talent seriously enough. Ray Bradbury encourages a young writer not to take the academic route. Rosellen Brown, Ann Beattie, and Joyce Carol Oates give the reader tactics for surviving the writing life. As Frederick Busch says in his introduction to this collection, \"this is a book of counsel and sustenance. . . . The readers of this book are about to receive the wisdom of those who know, from the inside of the process, what a writer might need, from time to time, to hear.\"",

        "Authors": "By Herrmann, Anne C. and Stewart, Abigail J. (EDT)",
        "Description": "In the past two decades, feminist scholars have produced an abundance of theoretical writing in humanities and social science disciplines. The result is a body of work that is extraordinarily rich, hard to keep up with, and extremely difficult to teach.With the appearance of Theorizing Feminism: Parallel Trends in the Humanities and Social Sciences, the first genuinely interdisciplinary anthology of significant contributions to feminist theory, teachers will finally have a volume that does justice to their topic. Creatively edited, with insightful introductory material, this timely reader illuminates the historical development of feminist theory as well as the current state of the field.Emphasizing common themes and interests in the humanities and social sciences, the editors have chosen those topics that have been central to feminist theory in many disciplines, that remain relevant to current debates, and that reflect the interests of a diverse community of thinkers.The contributors include leading figures from psychology, literary criticism, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, art history, law, and economics. This is the ideal text for any advanced course on interdisciplinary feminist theory, one that fills a long-standing gap in feminist pedagogy.",

You'll think \"what if\" instead of \"what is\" in order to take control of your material and cut loose the inhibitions of real life.In these pages, you'll learn how to hone your observation skills and fill your journal with rich and vivid details. (Because, as Hemley writes, \"Life is in the details, and so is good fiction.\") You'll see how to decide which ideas to bring to fiction and which ones to let go. And you'll learn how to: find the right form - novel, short story, vignette, memoir - for the story you want to tell; use \"triggers\" to start your reader's imagination rolling; keep your fiction emotionally honest by making the right choices between \"the way it happened\" and what the story dictates (ask \"Is it believable?\", not \"Did it happen?\"); create composites of real people and places that fit the unique needs of your story and empower your imagination; focus your fiction. Make sure everything, every character counts - and eliminate \"people who sit at the end of the bar without a role to play\"; fictionalize - ethically and legally - other people's stories. Learn your rights as a writer versus their rights to privacy. (Can you use actual names? When do you need to get permission?)To illustrate how writers feed their fiction with reality, Hemley uses examples from his own work and from fiction masters of yesterday and today. At the end of each chapter, challenging exercises help you apply the basic theories and push them even further.An adventurous read, Turning Life Into Fiction will help you create fiction that's just as strange and wonderful and \"real\" as the life that inspires it.",

It charts the progress of a young writer named Guillermo in the Honduran coastal town of La Ceiba. His nights alternate between falling deeply in love and loveless sexual escapades. His days are spent harvesting pineapples under a hot sun in the employ of the Standard Fruit Company. In the background there is a workers' strike at the plantation, a dance in La Ceiba, radio reports of the revolution going on in Nicaragua only a few hours' drive south, and the drone of American helicopters overhead. Quesada's world is topsy-turvy only in the sense that here human values of love and friendship dwarf the ostensibly much-larger corporate, military, and geopolitical issues.",

Article ideas are everywhere - but often buried, like mountains under molehills. McKinney helps you unearth yours and advises you in matching it to a magazine. And he shows you how to sell your article - before writing it - by creating a query letter sure to catch an editor by the imagination and intellect.Once you've got the nod, you'll talk to people and dig up information. Keeping the interview on track; the tape-or-notebook question; probing sensitive areas - McKinney helps you make these conversations count. He also ushers you into the library and to reference publications that will put you on the trail to facts you need. And he gives you an overview of computer databases and what's available on-line and on CD-ROM. Talk about saving time.And then, ready with the fruits of your research, armed with supporting comments, it's time to write. This book helps you by taking you into the very core of good wordsmithing. You'll learn about:Leads - the four basic functions your opening should serve, and four general categories of effective leads. You'll see how to grab your reader and yank him into your story. And how others, including E.B. White, Dave Barry and Frank DeFord, have done that.Endings - how to close your piece so that it rings in the reader's mind. You'll analyze ten types of finishes that McKinney identifies. Listen to the resonance in the samples of work by Shana Alexander, Saul Pett, John McPhee, Rex Reed and others.Structure - how to pound and knead and shape the agglomeration of information you've collected into a well-told tale. You'll learn about four types of article structure. And you'll see how, once you've got your story's elements in their proper places, to snug them up with transitions that make the reading smooth.Sparkle - that certain something that makes your writing stand out. Explore it, learn its ingredients through McKinney's narrative; watch it at work in the examples by W.C. \"Bill\" Heinz and Joan Didion and others. You'll see what separates average writing from good writing. This book will help you grasp it.In fact, this book will help you find your writing way in many ways, large and small.One of the larger ways is through a chapter devoted to helping you write the ever popular human-interest piece. You'll find out what kinds of articles editors seek - and why, if you meet someone with a true-drama tale, you should get the story and speed your query.Another chapter puts you onto, in McKinney's words, \"articles that anyone can write.\" You may have a wealth of material suitable for major magazines, right now, awaiting only your concentration and your fingers on the keys.Throughout this book, you'll find great writing examples. And in the back are profiles of accomplished magazine writers, including Maxine Rock, Barbara Raymond and Bil Gilbert; you'll gain a wealth of instruction through these essays. Following them, top editors - including Janet Chan of Redbook and Timothy Foote of Smithsonian - tell you what they want from writers.What do you want from yourself as a writer? To create solid, evocative articles? To place them in leading magazines? Of course you do.",

Now she turns her keen ear and observant eye toward the workplace--where the ways in which men and women communicate can determine who gets heard, who gets ahead, and what gets done.An instant classic, Talking From 9 to 5 brilliantly explains women's and men's conversational rituals--and the language barriers we unintentionally erect in the business world. It is a unique and invaluable guide to recognizing the verbal power games and miscommunications that cause good work to be underappreciated or go unnoticed--an essential tool for promoting more positive and productive professional relationships among men and women.",

        "Authors": "By Rhodes, Richard (EDT)",
        "Description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb provides a unique perspective on the twentieth century through a lively collection of writings about the unexpected and paradoxical ways in which technology has changed our lives -- and will affect our future.  Technology has been the blessing and the bane of the twentieth century. Human lifespan has nearly doubled in the West, but in no century have more human beings ever been killed by new technologies of war. Improvements in agriculture have fed increasing billions, but pesticides and chemicals threaten to poison the Earth.  Does technology improve us or diminish us? Enslave us or make us free? The problems and paradoxes of technology have stirred impassioned debate, yet, despite the central role technology has played in this century, Visions of Technology is the first book to explore the rich diversity of commentary about this vital subject.  Guided by the eminent Richard Rhodes, the reader of this provocative treasury will find highlighted the views of such prominent technological figures as Henry Ford, H. G. Wells, Rachel Carson, Margaret Sanger, Aldous Huxley, John Glenn and Gordon E. Moore. Visions of Technology also features thought-provoking images -- from the first X ray to R. Crumb's comic apocalypse -- which inform this original, much-needed roundtable.  Among the gems of opinion and history of technology gathered in this volume are Henry Ford on the horseless carriage, Thorstein Veblen on the discipline of the machine, David McCullough on the Panama Canal, Billy Mitchell on air warfare, Margaret Sanger on birth control, Robert Caro on Robert Moses, Charles Lindbergh on flying, James Agee on overalls, Lieutenant General Leslie R. Groves on the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer on science and war, Isaac Asimov on robotics, Alva Myrdal on \"Blue Jeans and Coca-Cola,\" Joan Didion on the Hoover Dam and Julian L. Simon on the pitfalls of making predictions (of which there are many in the 214 selections that make up this book).  At once a work of cultural history and of literature, Visions of Technology is an indispensable guide to understanding the world we have created for ourselves in the twentieth century and the problems we face at its conclusion.",

The melancholic, middle-aged lexicographer plunges into an increasingly ambiguous relationship with the vivacious Mrs. Thrale for the next twenty years. In that time Hester's eldest daughter, the neglected but prodigiously clever Queeney, will grow into young womanhood. Along the way, little of the emotional tangle and sexual tension stirring beneath the decorous surfaces of the Thrale household will escape Queeney's cold, observant eye. \"A dark, often hilarious and deeply human vision ... a major literary accomplishment.\"\u2014Margaret Atwood, Toronto Globe and Mail \"...at the end of this luminous little novel ... we feel two losses ... the personal one and the loss to civilization.\"\u2014Richard Bernstein, New York Times \"Dialogue and descriptions subtly and skillfully convey a sense not only of the period but also the personalities.\"\u2014Merle Rubin, Los Angeles Times \"[Bainbridge's] most accomplished novel so far.\"\u2014Washington Post Book World \"Majestically deft....

        "Title": "Nearer, My God: An Autobiography of Faith",
        "Authors": "By Buckley, William F.",
        "Description": "This is the story of one man's faith, told with unrivaled reflection and candor. William F. Buckley, Jr., was raised a Catholic. As the world plunged into war, and as social mores changed dramatically around him, Buckley's faith -- a most essential part of his make-up -- sustained him. In Nearer, My God, Buckley examines in searching detail the meaning of his faith, and how his life has been shaped and sustained by religious conviction.In highly personal terms, and with the wit and acuity for which he is justly renowned, Buckley discusses vital issues of Catholic doctrine and practice, and in so doing outlines for the reader both the nature of CathoLic faith and the essential role of religious belief in everyday life. In powerfully felt prose, he contributes provocatively and intelligently to the national interest in the nature of religion, the Church, and spiritual development. Nearer, My God is sure to appeal to all readers who have felt the stirrings of their own religious faith, and who want confirmation of their beliefs or who are seeking a guide to understanding their own souls. The renowned social and political commentator, William F. Buckley Jr., turns to a highly personal subject -- his faith. And he tells us the story of his life as a Catholic Christian. \"Nearer, My God\" is the most reflective, poignant, and searching of Bill Buckley's many books. In the opening chapters he relives his childhood, a loving, funny, nostalgic glimpse into pre-World War II America and England. He speaks about his religious experiences to a world that has changed dramatically. He is unafraid of revealing the most personal side of his faith. He describes, in his distinctive style, the intimacy of a trip to Lourdes, the impact on him of the searing account by Maria Valtorta of the Crucifixion, the ordination of his nephew into the priesthood, and gives a moving account of his mother's death. And there is humor, as Buckley gives a unique, hilarious view of a visit to the Vatican with Malcolm Muggeridge, Charlton Heston, Grace Kelly, and David Niven. Personal though this book is, Buckley has gone to others to examine new perspectives, putting together his own distinguished 'Forum' and leaning on the great literature of the past to illustrate his thinking on contemporary Catholic and Christian issues.",

Psychologist and bestselling author Samuel Osherson shines a light on those who are broadening the practice of Judaism: families observing the holidays at home; intermarried couples raising their children Jewish; study groups working with and without rabbis; and people inspired by their faith to creative work and charitable action. These people are widening the doors of Judaism, creating new rituals, increasing openness to other religions, and moving this patriarchal religion toward one without authoritarian figures. And here, Osherson, beginning a new chapter in the long story of the survival of the Jewish people, has provided a handbook for Jews yearning to redefine their relationship with Judaism and seeking to rebuild the bridges between their religious and cultural heritage. For the millions of assimilated, unaffiliated, or disaffected Jews who are quietly finding their way back to their religion, this book offers new approaches to an ancient tradition.",

        "Description": "To those struggling on the frontlines to save endangered plants and animals, the crucial challenge is to confront the biological causes of those species\u2019 decline. But just as threatening to their survival are obstacles erected by human politics, greed, corruption, folly, and hypocrisy. In this mesmerizing book, Beverly and Stephen Stearns tell the stories of people who have worked directly with disappearing species in Europe, Africa, North America, and Oceania. They are stories of passion and commitment, of competence and selflessness. They are also stories that alarm, for even as unheralded heroes are working to reverse what often seems to be a species\u2019 inevitable march toward extinction, incompetent or self-interested parties are often working against them.The authors interviewed people who work with endangered species as diverse as Mediterranean monk seals, large blue butterflies, African wild dogs, native Hawaiian crows, Texas salamanders, and rare plants on Mauritius. These dedicated individuals, in discussing how they view their work, the problems they encounter, and their thoughts on the broader significance of extinction, reveal that the causes of extinction are unique to each species\u2014sometimes subtle and complex, at other times obvious and simple. Yet an extinction always represents an irretrievable loss of evolutionary potential and a diminishing of the beauty, diversity, and value in our own lives. The dramatic lessons of this book shed new light on the problems of endangered species and offer hope that we may yet change the fate of those species that totter on the edge of extinction.",

Humes introduces a cast of passionate students, and touches on topics relevant to parents, teachers, administrators, and politicians, including destruction of equal education in America; standardized testing and cheating by students, parents, schools, and governments; public schools that succeed; and over-testing in our nation's schools.

The Honourable Mrs. Damer is a young widow of eccentric tastes, the only female sculptor of her time. The Earl of Derby, inventor of the horse race that bears his name, is the richest man in the House of Lords-and the ugliest. Miss Eliza Farren, born a nobody, now reigns as Queen of Comedy at Drury Lane Theatre. In a time of looming war and terrorism, of glittering spectacle and financial disasters, the wealthy liberals of the Whig Party work to topple a tyrannical prime minister and a lunatic king. Their marriages and friendships stretch or break; political liaisons prove as dangerous as erotic ones. Will Eliza Farren ever gain entry to that elite circle that calls itself the World? Can Lord Derby's pride endure public mockery of his long, unconsummated courtship of the actress? And how is Anne Damer ever to silence the whispers of Sapphism that haunt her?

        "Title": "Rules for Aging: A Wry and Witty Guide to Life",
        "Authors": "By Rosenblatt, Roger",
        "Description": "Acclaimed and beloved prize-winning essayist Roger Rosenblatt has commented on most of the trends and events of our time. His columns in Time magazine and his commentaries on PBS's News Hour with Jim Lehrer have made him a household word and a trusted friend of millions. With a wry sense of humor and inimitable wit, Rosenblatt offers here guidelines for aging that are both easy to understand and, more importantly, easy to implement.  More and more in the news today, we are hearing about phenomenal advances in the \"fight against aging.\" But what Rosenblatt suggests to combat age is far more valuable than any scientific breakthrough-he breaks down the hardest part of aging, the mental anguish of growing older with fifty-four gems of funny, brilliant, wise, indispensable advice. A book to savor, a book to keep, and a book for all ages.This little guide is intended for people who wish to age successfully, or at all. . . . One may think of this work as a how-to book, akin to many health guides published these days, whose purpose is to prolong our lives and make them richer. That is the aim of my book, too. -from the IntroductionAnd this is just the start of Roger Rosenblatt's charming and thought-provoking guide to surviving the episodes that shamelessly shave years off of our lives. With a wry sense of humor and peerless wit, Rules for Aging provides guidance that is, hands down, the most practical, pleasurable and, most importantly, painless advice you'll ever receive. As Rosenblatt writes, \"When I urge you to refrain from a certain thought or course of action, I do not mean to suggest that you are in any way wrong if you do the opposite. I mean only to say that you will suffer.\"Rule #1: It doesn't matterWhatever you think matters-doesn't. Follow this rule, and it will add decades to your life. It does not matter if you are late, or early; if you are here, or if you are there; if you said it, or did not say it; if you were clever, or if you were stupid; if you are having a bad hair day, or a no hair day; if your boss looks at you cockeyed; if your girlfriend or boyfriend looks at you cockeyed; if you don't get that promotion, or prize, or house, or if you do. It doesn't matter.",

        "Title": "American Places: Encounters with History",
        "Authors": "By Meyer, Sheldon (EDT) and Leuchtenburg, William E. (EDT)",
        "Description": "For anyone interested in history, the physical traces of the past, especially historical places, hold a special fascination. Whether it is a battlefield or the home of a notable American, there is no question that we understand the past in a different and more immediate way when we encounter it \"on the ground.\"     In American Places, more than two dozen of America's most gifted historians write about their own encounters with historic places, bringing a personal viewpoint to bear on a wide variety of sites, ranging from Monticello to Fenway Park. Here James M. McPherson writes about the battlefield of Gettysburg, and how walking the ground of Pickett's Charge inspired one of his books. Kevin Starr visits the Musso & Frank Grill in Hollywood and finds many of the flavors of California history there. Joel Williamson takes a bemused tour of Elvis Presley's Graceland, and David Kennedy tells the story of the \"Pig War\" of San Juan Island, where a spat between Britain and America over a speck of land in the Pacific helped determine the shape of the U.S. and Canada. William Freehling compares two places, Charleston's Battery and New Orleans' Jackson Square, showing how each reveals the different spirit of the society that created it. And Edward Ayers talks about spending time in Cyberspace, U.S.A., a virtual place that has much in common with the America visited by Alexis de Tocqueville a century and a half ago. Other pieces include Robert Dallek on the FDR Memorial, David Hackett Fischer on the Boston Common, and William Leuchtenburg on his native borough of Queens.     American Places celebrates the career of Sheldon Meyer, who over his years at Oxford University Press has published some of our most distinguished historians, including many Pulitzer Prize and Bancroft Prize winners, virtually all of whom have contributed to this volume.",

In the United States, the Socialist Party, led by Hosea Blackford, battles Calvin Coolidge to hold on to the Powell House in Philadelphia. And it seems as if the Socialists can do no wrong, for the stock market soars and America enioys prosperity unknown in a half century. But as old names like Custer and Roosevelt fade into history, a new generation faces new uncertainties.The Confederate States, victorious in the War of Secession and in the Second Mexican War but at last tasting defeat in the Great War, suffer poverty and natural calamity. The Freedom Party promises new strength and pride. But if its chief seizes the reins of power, he may prove a dangerous enemy for the hated U.S.A. Yet the United States take little note. Sharing world domination with Germany, they consider events in the Confederacy of little consequence.As the 1920s end, calamity casts a pall across the continent. With civil war raging in Mexico, terrorist uprisings threatening U.S. control in Canada, and an explosion of violence in Utah, the United States are rocked by uncertainty.",

        "Title": "Dispatches from the Front: A History of the American War Correspondent",
        "Authors": "By Lande, Nathaniel",
        "Description": "Since the founding of the United States, war has been a recurring phenomenon in American history.  We have fought for many reasons:  independence, national unity, manifest destiny, international democracy.  Americans have fought in almost every corner of the world, from deserts to mountains to jungles.  And in every war on every front, we have paid intense attention.  Typewriter patriots, equipped with telegraphs, radio microphones, or satellite links, have been the conduit for a public eager to imagine and feel every musket fire and missile blast from Lexington to Baghdad.   In Dispatches from the Front we have unique and special dispatches from ten American wars.  In the correspondents' words ring the passion and drama of war from the American Revolution to the Persian Gulf War.  The work of Thomas Paine, Stephen Crane, Ernest Hemingway, Ernie Pyle, Edward R. Morrow, Sydney Schanberg, and more than sixty other correspondents tell us of America's wars as they happened, on the battlefield and on the home front.  Brief essays introduce each war by discussing the important changes taking place in American society and providing a series of \"national snapshots\" of the economic, political, and technological character of the world and the country at the time.  The impact of these factors on each episode of warfare is considered, followed by a focus on the experiences of the war itself.   Over the years, the words of press observers have been central in fostering wartime nationalism.  Reporters functioned as frontline poets, scratching the first impressions into the culture's consciousness. The tone and character of the press coverage shaped the nation's understanding of itself. Dispatches from the Front offers insight into the culture of the United States at each crisis point, from its beginnings to the present time.",

        "Title": "On Hallowed Ground: Abraham Lincoln and the Foundations of American History",
        "Authors": "By Diggins, John Patrick",
        "Description": "In this provocative book, John Patrick Diggins, hailed by Alan Ryan in the New York Times as \u201cone of the liveliest and most interesting of contemporary intellectual historians,\u201d offers a sweeping reassessment of American history, emphasizing the foundational role of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s moral and political theory. Distressed by the divisive impact of modern identity politics, Diggins argues persuasively that in the central tenets of Lincoln\u2019s political faith--the redeeming value of labor and the rights to property and self-determination--we find the purest expression of the values that have united Americans and guided American history.With his characteristic breadth, Diggins ranges from James Madison to W. E. B. Du Bois to the movie Good Will Hunting in his examination of the often ambivalent ways in which Americans have imagined themselves and their nation. Convinced that contemporary historians have done America a grave disservice by emphasizing political divisions along the lines of class, race, and gender, Diggins points out that throughout American history there has been more that unites the American people than divides them.",
