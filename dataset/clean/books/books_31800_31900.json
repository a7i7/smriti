Wollie is meeting plenty of eligible bachelors but not falling in love, not until she stumbles over a dead body en route to Rio Pescado--a state-run mental hospital--and is momentarily taken hostage by a charismatic \"doctor\" who is on the run from the Mob. Wollie fears that her beloved brother, a paranoid schizophrenic living at Rio Pescado, is involved in the murder, so rather than go to the authorities, she decides to solve the crime on her own. As she meets up with an array of small-time crooks and swaggering mobsters only slightly more sinister than the men she\u2019s been dating, Wollie realizes that \"getting dumped\" is the least of her problems. Finding true love, she discovers, sometimes means learning how to avoid getting killed . . . Dating Dead Men will keep readers guessing until the final bullet is shot--and cheering for the irresistible Wollie as she makes her way out of confusion and into the welcoming embrace of Mr. Right.",

        "Description": "At last, a book of sage advice that will help frustrated parents reconnect with their teenager and keep that connection even in today's often-crazy world.The first step is simple: realizing that inside every teen resides two very different people-the regressed child and the emergent adult. The emergent adult is seen at school, on the playing field, in his first job, and in front of his friends' families. Unfortunately, his parents usually see only the regressed child-moody and defiant-and, if they're not on the lookout, they'll miss seeing the more agreeable, increasingly adult thinker in their midst.With ingenious strategies for coaxing the more attractive of the two teen personalities into the home, family psychologist Mike Riera gives new hope to beleaguered and harried parents. From moving from a \"managing\" to a \"consulting\" role in a teen's life, from working with a teen's uniquely exasperating sleep rhythms to having real conversations when only monosyllables have been previously possible, Staying Connected to Your Teenager demonstrates ways to bring out the best in a teen-and, consequently, in an entire family.",

It is also the one issue above all others that can make or break an election. And this is why the Democratic Party has been steadily losing power since 2001. In Hard Power, Michael O'Hanlon, an expert on foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, and Kurt Campbell, an authority on international security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explain how the Democrats lost credibility on issues of security and foreign policy, how they can get it back--and why they must. They recall the successful Democratic military legacy of past decades, as well as recent Democratic innovations--like the Homeland Security Office and the idea of nation-building--that have been successfully co-opted by the Republican administration. And, most importantly, they develop a broad national security vision for America, including specific defense policies and a strategy to win the war on terror.",

        "Description": "Young children ask questions about sex, sexuality, conception, and birth that can be embarrassing or uncomfortable for parents. With her characteristic good sense and cool head, author Deborah Roffman will put even the most awkward parents at ease, giving them the skills to talk confidently with young children about these important but delicate issues. In this wonderfully reassuring book, readers will learn that the key to talking with children about sex is knowing that their questions fall into three easily recognizable categories. At age three or four, kids are curious about geography (\"Where was I before I was here?\"), and at four or five, about delivery (\"Exactly how did I get out of there?\"). Finally, the six year old's classic stumper--\"But how'd I get in there in the first place?\"--is about cause and effect, not about imminent sexual activity! With the emotional and developmental underpinnings of a child's curiosity understood, parents will find their tongues; with Deborah Roffman's wise, warm and practical advice, they will be well prepared for the inevitable flow of questions in the years to come.",

        "Authors": "By Peters, Charles",
        "Description": "There were four strong contenders when the Republican party met in June of 1940 in Philadelphia to nominate its candidate for president: the crusading young attorney and  rising Republican star Tom Dewey, solid members of the Republican establishment Robert Taft and Arthur Vandenberg, and dark horse Wendell Willkie, utilities executive, favorite of the literati and only very recently even a Republican. The leading Republican candidates  campaigned as isolationists. The charismatic Willkie, newcomer and upstager, was a liberal interventionist, just as anti-Hitler as FDR. After five days of floor rallies, telegrams from across the country, multiple ballots, rousing  speeches, backroom deals, terrifying international  news, and, most of all, the relentless chanting of \"We Want Willkie\" from the gallery, Willkie walked away with the nomination.     The story of how this happened \u2014 and of how essential his nomination would prove in allowing FDR to save Britain and prepare this country for entry into World War II \u2014 is all told in Charles Peters' Five Days in Philadelphia. As Peters shows, these five action-packed days and their improbable outcome were as important as the Battle of Britain in defeating the Nazis.",

        "Authors": "By Galford, Robert M. and Fazio Maruca, Regina",
        "Description": "You should worry about your legacy later in your career, at the edge of retirement&#151;right? Not according to Robert Galford and Regina Maruca. In Your Leadership Legacy, these authors argue that thinking about your legacy now makes you a better leader today. Based on stories of top leaders who have shaped successful careers, the book explores the art of \"legacy thinking,\" helping you to formulate a legacy that will exert a positive effect on your work immediately. The authors provide a disciplined approach to framing your legacy, as well as shaping it over time. They start with the idea that your legacy is defined by how others approach work and life as a result of having worked with you. They then demonstrate how to assess your current impact on those around you, strengthen that impact, and pass along the best of yourself in the process. While many leaders \"find themselves\" and hone their work accordingly only after a major life crisis, Your Leadership Legacy enables all leaders to craft their work and build their legacy unburdened by such crises, and to experience personal satisfaction and achievement throughout their working lives.",

        "Description": "critically ill and unlikely to survive. A recent Harvard University study on pediatric end-of-life care has shown that the medical community is failing such children and their families. Indeed, in their effort to be ever-hopeful and cure-oriented in the face of a child's terminal illness, they neglect to advise parents on the basics of emotional support for all family members, pediatric pain medication, and the need for making plans and worst-case preparations.Based on the National Advanced Illness Coordinated Care program and the stories and advice gleaned from co-author Joanne Hilden's years of work as a pediatric oncologist, Shelter from the Storm fills this advice-and-caregiving void. A compassionate road map to what the family may have to face, what they may be asked to decide, and how they might want to involve their child in the decision-making, Shelter from the Storm will help parents and caregivers make informed, loving, and protective choices on behalf of their children in the most trying of times.",

        "Title": "Unstrange Minds: Remapping the World of Autism",
        "Authors": "By Grinker, Roy Richard",
        "Description": "\"When anthropologist Roy Richard Grinker's daughter was diagnosed with autism in 1994, it was considered a very rare disorder, occurring in only about 1 in every 10,000 children. Within ten years, rates as high as 1 in 150 were being reported, and the media was declaring autism an epidemic. Unstrange Minds documents Grinker's quest to find out why autism is so much more common today, and to uncover the implications of the increase. His search took him to Africa, India, and East Asia, to the National Institutes of Mental Health, and to the mountains of Appalachia. What he discovered is both surprising and controversial: There is no true increase in autism. Grinker shows that the identification and treatment of autism depends on culture just as much as on science. As more and more cases of autism are documented, doctors are describing the disorder better, school systems are coding it better--and children are benefiting. Filled with moving stories and informed by the latest science, Unstrange Minds is unlike any other book on autism. It is a powerful testament to a father's quest for the truth, and is urgently relevant to anyone whose life is touched by one of history's most puzzling disorders.\"",

        "Authors": "By Baer, Robert",
        "Description": "In his explosive New York Times bestseller, top CIA operative Robert Baer paints a chilling picture of how terrorism works on the inside and provides startling evidence of how Washington politics sabotaged the CIA\u2019s efforts to root out the world\u2019s deadliest terrorists, allowing for the rise of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda and the continued entrenchment of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.A veteran case officer in the CIA\u2019s Directorate of Operations in the Middle East, Baer witnessed the rise of terrorism first hand and the CIA\u2019s inadequate response to it, leading to the attacks of September 11, 2001. This riveting book is both an indictment of an agency that lost its way and an unprecedented look at the roots of modern terrorism, and includes a new afterword in which Baer speaks out about the American war on terrorism and its profound implications throughout the Middle East.\u201cRobert Baer was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field officer in the Middle East.\u201d\u2013Seymour M. Hersh, The New YorkerFrom The PrefaceThis book is a memoir of one foot soldier\u2019s career in the other cold war, the one against terrorist networks. It\u2019s a story about places most Americans will never travel to, about people many Americans would prefer to think we don\u2019t need to do business with.This memoir, I hope, will show the reader how spying is supposed to work, where the CIA lost its way, and how we can bring it back again. But I hope this book will accomplish one more purpose as well: I hope it will show why I am angry about what happened to the CIA. And I want to show why every American and everyone who cares about the preservation of this country should be angry and alarmed, too.The CIA was systematically destroyed by political correctness, by petty Beltway wars, by careerism, and much more. At a time when terrorist threats were compounding globally, the agency that should have been monitoring them was being scrubbed clean instead. Americans were making too much money to bother. Life was good. The White House and the National Security Council became cathedrals of commerce where the interests of big business outweighed the interests of protecting American citizens at home and abroad. Defanged and dispirited, the CIA went along for the ride. And then on September 11, 2001, the reckoning for such vast carelessness was presented for all the world to see.",

A modern fable reminiscent of Camus\u2019s classic The Plague, The Traveler\u2019s Tree is at its core an exploration of man\u2019s nature.Somewhere in the Caribbean Sea the French ship Entremetteuse lies stranded without a breeze, its crew racked by starvation and disease, its wood rotting, and its masts limp.  An island and the dim outline of the fabled traveler\u2019s tree appear on the horizon. Although only a gunshot away, the island\u2019s sheer cliffs and coral reefs make it cruelly unreachable. The heat grows unbearable, the ship\u2019s stores are nearly depleted, and the rats eagerly await the remains.As listless as the ship and increasingly feeble with scurvy, the embattled crew dispatches one longboat after another against raging waves, barrier reefs, and poisonous fish in order to reach the island, but to no avail. As mutiny, rebellion, and utter starvation loom, they pin their last hopes on a direct charge of the ship across the reefs, in one last valiant effort to reach the traveler\u2019s tree.Hailed in France as &#147;a superb allegory\u201d (Le Monde), The Traveler\u2019s Tree is an enthralling novel that tells a story of the human condition and man\u2019s limitations. Writing with extraordinary realism and historical accuracy, Bruno Bontempelli lures us into this absorbing morality tale that will be remembered for years to come.",

        "Authors": "By Freedman, Marc",
        "Description": "Over the next three decades, the number of Americans over fifty will double, swelling to more than a quarter of the population. Already we are living thirty years longer than a century ago, with further gains expected in the coming years. The end result is a new stage of life, one as long or longer than childhood or middle age in duration, and one spent in unprecedented good health. Yet, as individuals, and as a society, we've shown little imagination or wisdom in using this great gift of a third age. Marc Freedman identifies the new longevity as not a problem to be solved, but an opportunity to be seized-provided we can engage the experience, talent, and idealism of older Americans. At a juncture when the middle-generation faces a time-famine, struggling to simultaneously raise kids and work long hours on the job, the older generation is awash in free time, poised to succeed women as the trustees of civic life in this country. In the process they stand to find new meaning and purpose in their lives, and abandon the limbo-like state unfulfilling for so many older individuals. Freedman argues that the aging phenomenon, the massive transformation that many portray as our downfall, may in fact be our best hope for renewal as a nation.",

Rischard challenges us to take a new approach to the twenty most important and urgent global problems of the twenty-first century. Rischard finds their common thread: we don't have an effective way of dealing with the problems that our increasingly crowded, interconnected world creates. Our difficulties belong to the future, but our means of solving them belong to the past.Rischard proposes new vehicles for global problem-solving that are startling and persuasive. With its clear-eyed urgency and refreshing specificity, High Noon is an agenda-setting book that everyone who cares about the future must read.",

But today, the shift from the physical to the digital is mixing, burning, and ripping our lives apart. In the past, everything had its one place\u2014the physical world demanded it\u2014but now everything has its places: multiple categories, multiple shelves. Simply put, everything is suddenly miscellaneous.\u00a0In Everything Is Miscellaneous, David Weinberger charts the new principles of digital order that are remaking business, education, politics, science, and culture. In his rollicking tour of the rise of the miscellaneous, he examines why the Dewey decimal system is stretched to the breaking point, how Rand McNally decides what information not to include in a physical map (and why Google Earth is winning that battle), how Staples stores emulate online shopping to increase sales, why your children\u2019s teachers will stop having them memorize facts, and how the shift to digital music stands as the model for the future in virtually every industry. Finally, he shows how by \u201cgoing miscellaneous,\u201d anyone can reap rewards from the deluge of information in modern work and life.\u00a0From A to Z, Everything Is Miscellaneous will completely reshape the way you think\u2014and what you know\u2014about the world.",

As the enormous door opened at the top of the ramp, and humans were herded into the maw of a vessel that made the Queen Elizabeth look like a bathtub toy, Kristin let her mind go blank and realized that nothing would be normal, ever again.But on the whole she has survived rather well. The Catteni value strength and intelligence in their slaves. And so Kris has found herself part of a tremendous alien experiment - one that gives her back her freedom, in a way, though she knows she will not see Denver again. Once again she was driven into the hold of an enormous ship, and once again awoke on a strange planet, this time with no master giving orders. The Catteni have discovered a new world, and they have a pragmatic way of finding out whether it is habitable: hundreds of slaves have been dropped there and left to their own resources. If they survive, the world will be deemed fit for Catteni colonization. If they die, well, slaves are a nuisance to replace, but there are always more.The new world is beautiful, green and well-watered. Its dangers are hidden. Kris and her fellow colonists have a couple of advantages, though, that may help them survive. They have individuals like Kris, who are strong and determined to take advantage of this unexpected chance at a free life. And they have Zainal, a Catteni aristocrat, condemned to join the slaves as punishment for killing one of his own kind. His scraps of knowledge about the new world may mean the difference between life and death for them all. And as Kris is surprised to find, his quiet strength and alien golden eyes create feelings in her that she never thought she would have again.",

Her single mother, Celia, working at a video store by day and a piano bar by night, is not always around to shield her daughter from the attention\u2014both benign and sinister\u2014that her beauty draws. Attention from model agencies, for example, or from Ron, a small-appliance repairman who, having seen Rachel once, is driven to see her again and again.When a summer blackout plunges the city into darkness and confusion, Rachel is taken from her home. A full-scale search begins, but days pass with no solid clues, only a phone call Celia receives from a woman whose voice she has heard before but cannot place. And as Celia fights her terror and Rachel starts to trust in her abductor\u2019s kindness, the only other person who knows where she is wavers between loyalty to the captor and saving the child. Will Rachel be found before her abductor\u2019s urge to protect and cherish turns to something altogether less innocent?Tapping into the fear that lies just below the surface of contemporary city life, Barbara Gowdy draws on her trademark empathy and precision to create a portrait of love at its most consuming and ambiguous and to uncover the volatile point at which desire gives way to the unthinkable.",

In The Sorrows of Empire, he explored the ways in which the growth of American militarism and the garrisoning of the planet have jeopardized our stability. Now, in Nemesis, he shows how imperial overstretch is undermining the republic itself, both economically and politically.Delving into new areas\u2014from plans to militarize outer space to Constitution-breaking presidential activities at home and the devastating corruption of a toothless Congress\u2014Nemesis offers a striking description of the trap into which the dreams of America\u2019s leaders have taken us. Drawing comparisons to empires past, Johnson explores in vivid detail just what the unintended consequences of our dependence on a permanent war economy are likely to be. What does it mean when a nation\u2019s main intelligence organization becomes the president\u2019s secret army? Or when the globe\u2019s sole \u201chyperpower,\u201d no longer capable of paying for the vaulting ambitions of its leaders, becomes the greatest hyper-debtor of all times?

        "Description": "In a bracing work of history, a leading international finance expert reveals how our national security depends on our financial securityMore than two centuries ago, America\u2019s first secretary of the treasury, Alexander Hamilton, identified the Revolutionary War debt as a threat to the nation\u2019s creditworthiness and its very existence. In response, he established financial principles for securing the country\u2014principles that endure to this day. In this provocative history, Robert D. Hormats, one of America\u2019s leading experts on international finance, shows how leaders from Madison and Lincoln to FDR and Reagan have followed Hamilton\u2019s ideals, from the greenback and a progressive income tax to the Victory Bond and Victory Garden campaigns and cost-sharing with allies. Drawing on these historical lessons, Hormats argues that the rampant borrowing to pay for the war in Iraq and the short-sighted tax cuts in the face of a long-term war on terrorism run counter to American tradition and place our country\u2019s security in peril. To meet the threats facing us, Hormats contends, we must significantly realign our economic policies\u2014on taxes, Social Security, Medicare, and oil dependency\u2014to safeguard our liberty and our future.",

        "Description": "\"A highly personal, honest, funny and well-informed account of China's hyperactive effort to forget its past and reinvent its future.\"--The New York Times Book Review As one the first American students admitted to China after the communist revolution, John Pomfret was exposed to a country still emerging from the twin tragedies of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Crammed into a dorm room with seven Chinese men, Pomfret contended with all manner of cultural differences, from too-short beds and roommates intent on glimpsing a white man naked, to the need for cloak-and-dagger efforts to conceal his relationships with Chinese women. Amidst all that, he immersed himself in the remarkable lives of his classmates.Beginning with Pomfret's first day in China, Chinese Lessons takes us down the often torturous paths that brought together the Nanjing University History Class of 1982: Old Wu's father was killed during the Cultural Revolution for the crime of being an intellectual; Book Idiot Zhou labored in the fields for years rather than agree to a Party-arranged marriage; and Little Guan was forced to publicly denounce and humiliate her father. As Pomfret follows his classmates from childhood to adulthood, he examines the effect of China's transition from near-feudal communism to first-world capitalism. The result is an illuminating report from present-day China, and a moving portrait of its extraordinary people.",

Lane has gardened for as long as he can remember, and his garden's life has become inseparable from his own. A new bloom on a plant, a skirmish among the birds, the way a tree bends in the wind, and the slow, measured change of seasons invariably bring to his mind an episode from his eventful past.  What the Stones Remember  is the emerging chronicle of Lane's attempt to face those memories, as well as his new self\u2014to rediscover his life. In this powerful and beautifully written book, Lane offers readers an unflinching and unsentimental account of coming to one's senses in the presence of nature.",

        "Authors": "By Drucker, Eugene",
        "Description": "A magnetic debut novel from world-renowned violinist Eugene DruckerSet during the final weeks of World War II, The Savior is the story of Gottfried Keller, a young German violinist. Exempted from military service, Keller is burdened with the demoralizing task of playing for wounded soldiers in hospitals and makeshift infirmaries.As he leaves his apartment one morning to pick up a new assignment at headquarters, Keller finds an SS driver waiting for him and is escorted without explanation to a labor camp outside his town. There he is introduced to the camp's Kommandant, who tells Keller that he will spend the next four days performing for the inmates as part of an experiment in reviving hope in those who have lost it completely.Overwhelmed by fear and compelled by the temptation of using his talent to affect others so powerfully, Keller finds himself playing a series of concerts for the prisoners -- and seeing with his own eyes the horrifying truths within the barbed-wire fence. As he plays the music of Ysa\u00ffe, Hindemith and Bach, most notably the searing Chaconne, Keller's own questionable past unfolds, revealing the loss of his closest friend and the Jewish fianc\u00e9e from whom he fled in fear of being caught as a Jew-lover. As he bears witness to the camp's atrocities, Keller's horror toward the perpetrators and their crime begins to fade, revealing his own culpability.Beautifully conceived and gracefully written, The Savior is a complex and illuminating character study of a man severed from his past expectations and an artist struggling with his identity in the face of human catastrophe.",

        "Title": "The Gulf Conflict, 1990-1991: Diplomacy and War in the New World Order",
        "Authors": "By Karsh, Efraim and Freedman, Lawrence",
        "Description": "The Gulf Conflict provides the most authoritative and comprehensive account to date of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, its expulsion by a coalition of Western and Arab forces seven months later, and the aftermath of the war. Blending compelling narrative history with objective analysis, Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh inquire into the fundamental issues underlying the dispute and probe the strategic calculations of all the participants. As seen by the authors, the conflict offers a remarkable \"snapshot\" of the international system at the start of the 1990s and an opportunity to explore the global impact of the breakup of the Soviet empire in Europe. Resisting the temptation to view the situation in the Gulf as a prizefight between George Bush and Saddam Hussein, Freedman and Karsh analyze the war in relation to more general problems of the conduct of diplomacy and the role of military force in the \"New World Order.\" They have produced what promises to be the standard work on the Gulf conflict.Why did Saddam Hussein invade Kuwait in the first place? Once he had done so, were there any viable alternatives to the war? How precise was the use of military power? And, finally, how has Saddam been able to remain in power? To answer these key questions, the authors have uncovered new material not used in previous accounts. They have gathered here evidence from all available sources: government and other official documents, newspaper files, academic studies, and personal interviews with policymakers from both sides. The unique value of The Gulf Conflict, however, lies in the novelty of its analysis. Throughout the book Freedman and Karsh address not only American but also European, Soviet, and Middle Eastern decisions in an effort to redress the \"Washington bias\" found elsewhere. Neither a celebration of the war nor an indictment of it, The Gulf Conflict is a comprehensive account that reveals the interaction of all the parties involved.",

        "Description": "Beyond the Wall is the first book, in either English or German, to tell the whole story of the extraordinary revolution that demolished the Berlin Wall, ended the Cold war, and tore apart the Soviet regime. Elizabeth Pond, former Moscow and European correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor, was an eyewitness to the dramatic events of 1989-92 and to the fifteen years of relations between Germany and Eastern Europe leading up to them. Pond weaves together in riveting prose the strands of events that are usually recounted separately. Rather than looking just at the East German revolt or the process of unification that created a new nation, she traces the interaction of these events and their diplomatic consequences for Europe. Pond shows the political, economic, and social forces at work--leading up to the unification, during the transition process, and in the aftermath. Looking at the European framework, she explains how significantly the European Community and its move toward integration both affected and were affected by German unification. The book contains a wealth of new information form hundreds of interviews with top German and American policymakers, East German Politburo members and average German citizens. It also incorporates up-to-date research on such topics as the Stasi secret police and the midlife crisis of the German left. Pond concludes with an assessment of the roles of the United States and a unified Germany in the new Europe. Calling for a continued partnership between the United States and Germany, who \"have come through a common baptism of fire since the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" Pond casts an optimistic eye toward the future.",

Although the generic tags of HTML are sufficient for everyday  text, XML gives us a way to add rich, well-defined markup to  electronic documents.The XML Pocket Reference is both a handy introduction to  XML terminology and syntax, and a quick reference to XML instructions, attributes, entities, and datatypes. It also covers XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language), necessary to  ensure that your XML documents have a consistent look and  feel across platforms.Although XML itself is complex, its basic concepts are  simple. This small book acts both as a perfect tutorial  for learning the basics of XML, and as a reference to the  XML and XSL specifications.",

By day he passed through mountains covered in nine feet of snow, hamlets burned and emptied by the Taliban, and communities thriving amid the remains of medieval civilizations. By night he slept on villagers' floors, shared their meals, and listened to their stories of the recent and ancient past. Along the way Stewart met heroes and rogues, tribal elders and teenage soldiers, Taliban commanders and foreign-aid workers. He was also adopted by an unexpected companion-a retired fighting mastiff he named Babur in honor of Afghanistan's first Mughal emperor, in whose footsteps the pair was following.Through these encounters-by turns touching, con-founding, surprising, and funny-Stewart makes tangible the forces of tradition, ideology, and allegiance that shape life in the map's countless places in between.",

        "Description": "The modern presidency really begins on September 14, 1901, argues Stephen Graubard, with the assassination of William McKinley and the succession of Teddy Roosevelt. TR's vigorous presidency foretold the expansion of wartime authority under Wilson; the growth of federal government under FDR; and the national security issues that dominated much of the foreign policy concerns during the Cold War.In his provocative new account of the enormous shift of power to the office of the American presidency, Graubard draws upon his intimate knowledge of every president since FDR to reveal the dangerous transformation of the executive branch in the last hundred years. Graubard sees three different \"presidencies\" over the course of the century, marked by increasing accumulation of authority: the presidency created by TR, Wilson, and FDR, continued under Truman and Eisenhower, in which foreign policy issues played a far greater role in presidential politics; the period of America's time of troubles from Kennedy to Carter, in which the disastrous Vietnam War spurred a further tendency to secrecy; and the third presidency, defined by Reagan and marked by spin. Learning the lessons of Reagan and Clinton, George W. Bush has inherited a far more powerful office than the one originally envisioned by the Founding Fathers. With access to former members of both Republican and Democratic administrations, Graubard has written a masterful history of presidential power--one that anyone concerned with American politics will need to read.",

        "Description": "Wilhelm Busch (1832-1908), endowed with an equipotent facility with sketch-pad and rhyming dictionary, created some of the most arresting sketches and drollest verses the world has yet seen.In addition to the title piece, this book reprints \u201cKer and Plunk\u201d (Plisch und Plum), \u201cThe Egghead and the Two Cut-ups of Corinth\u201d (Diogenes and die b\u00f6sen Buben von Korinth), \u201cThe Raven-robbin\u2019 Rascals\u201d (Das Rabennest), \u201cDeceitful Henry\u201d (Der hinterlistige Heinrich), \u201cThe Boy and the Popgun\u201d (Das Pusterrohr), \u201cIce-Peter\u201d (Der Eispeter), \u201cThe Boy and the Pipe\u201d (Krischan mit der Piepe), \u201cFirm Faith\u201d (Fester Glauben), \u201cThe Two Ducks and the Frog\u201d (Die beiden Enten und der Frosch), and \u201cCat and Mouse\u201d (Katze und Maus).By turns malevolent, jovial, sardonic, diabolical, and bloodthirsty, these verses tellingly castigate hypocrisy, stodginess, stupidity, egotism, drunkenness, and other human foibles. The English translations, printed opposite the original German, are ingenious and faithful, with spice and sense both intact.",
