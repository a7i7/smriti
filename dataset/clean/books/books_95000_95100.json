Janov shows how any organization that hopes to thrive into the next century can learn to develop the essential building blocks to inventiveness: focus on customer needs; concentrate on core work; practice living organizational values; think systemically; promote self-regulation; build and support interdependence; and understand leading as guiding the development of the system and following as pursuing common cause.Janov offers inspiration, frameworks, and practical applications for executives, managers, and organization consultants who are facing the fundamental challenges in organizations today: how to sustain success in a constantly changing global economy, how to redesign work processes for optimal effectiveness, and how to realign roles and relationships as flattened hierarchies necessitate self-regulation throughout the entire organization.",

        "Description": "Ralph Peters--career soldier, controversial strategist, prize-winning, best-selling novelist, erstwhile rock musician, popular columnist, and old-fashioned adventurer--has always been good for a surprise. Now, for the first time, Peters recounts the personal experiences that shaped his views of the world, from the collapsing Soviet Union to the drug wars of the Andean Ridge, from quiet forays into Burma and Laos to military missions to Pakistan and the Caucasus--and on to the Southwest border of the United States and the meanest streets of Los Angeles. As the U.S. Army's chosen troubleshooter before he took off his uniform to write, Peters saw the greatest international dramas of our times and the personal tragedies they created from a truly unique perspective--and took advantage of every moment \"outside of the wire.\"The result is startling: the liveliest adventure memoir by an American in decades, a perfect balance of high drama and laugh-out-loud hilarity. Readers--among them his many devoted fans--will meet a faded beauty and former favorite singer of Josef Stalin's, now in her nineties and still a hopeless coquette; KGB officers who refuse to let go of the past in Moscow's back streets; a winsome princess adrift in a dying world; the corrupt Thai police general whose hobby was imitating Elvis to karaoke machines in rural bordellos; sentimental Caucasian gangsters; oblivious diplomats; wary Burmese colonels; doomed Mexican drug cops; Mennonite marijuana farmers; lonesome Nazi widows in Bolivia--and their Jewish friends; Muslim fundamentalists who write love poetry to imagined sweethearts . . . and, above all, the author's two loyal brothers-in-arms who sometimes shared the dangers and the wonder at the \"back of beyond\" and whose remarkable personal backgrounds, dashingly eccentric personalities, and appetite for adventure explode every clich\u00e9 about military officers. Beautifully written and hauntingly told, Looking for Trouble is simply the book Ralph Peters was born to write. We can all be glad that he came back alive to write it.",

        "Title": "Saving Henry: A Mother's Journey",
        "Authors": "By Strongin, Laurie",
        "Description": "\"A heartbreaking story, exquisitely told . . . Laurie Strongin's integrity, humanity, and wisdom are an inspiration to the rest of us.\"--David Shenk, author of The ForgettingSaving Henry is the eye-opening and inspiring story of how far a family will go to save the life of their child. Laurie Strongin's son Henry was born with a heart condition that was operable, but which proved to be a precursor for a rare, almost-always fatal illness: Fanconi anemia. Deciding to pursue every avenue that might provide a cure, Laurie and her husband signed on for a brand new procedure that combined in vitro fertilization with genetic testing to produce a baby without the disease, who could be a stem cell donor for Henry. As Laurie puts it: \"I believe in love and science, nothing more and nothing less.\"Laurie and her husband endured nine failed courses of the procedure before giving up. But Saving Henry is also about hope. It is the story of Henry, the feisty little boy who loved Batman, Cal Ripken Jr., and root beer-flavored anesthesia, and who captivated everyone with his spunk and positive attitude. When the nurses came to take blood samples, Henry brandished his toy sword and said, \"Bring it on!\" When he lost his hair after a chemo treatment, he declared, \"Hey, I look like Michael Jordan!\"Laurie became a fervent advocate for stem cell research, working with policymakers and the scientific community to bring attention to Henry's case and to the groundbreaking research that could save many lives. Henry's courage and bravery inspired nurses, doctors, friends, and family. Saving Henry is the story of one family's search for a cure, and the long-lasting scientific impact their amazing little boy has had.Praise for Saving Henry\"How do you make beauty and meaning out of unimaginable sorrow? Saving Henry is a stirring account of struggle, love, and loss that manages to be both honest and inspiring.\"--Rabbi David Wolpe, author of Making Loss Matter and Why Faith Matters\"Henry's story is important and newsworthy; a testament to how the debate over medical technology and stem cell research is not just an academic argument, but also a searingly personal one. Mostly, though, it's an intimate love story. We should all learn from Henry what his family has learned--to live well and laugh hard.\"--Lisa Belkin, journalist, The New York Times\"Saving Henry is a marvelously told tale of love triumphant. Parents often say they would do anything for their children. This is the story of a couple that actually did.\"--Jeffrey Goldberg, national correspondent, The Atlantic\"There's a reason Saving Henry rings with so much truth: the author lived every word of it. It's a vivid, beautifully rendered, and almost painfully honest account of a journey none of them wanted to take, but could not avoid, thanks to a bad throw of the genetic dice. Laurie, her husband Allen, and especially little Henry, become pioneers in a landscape of complex technological procedures that offer hope but also bring pain . . . and yet they keep trying. This is a tale of a family that will not quit.\"--John Donvan, correspondent, ABC News\"Strongin has a gift for telling a complex medical story as an unfolding family narrative--a family that in so many ways is my family, your family, anybody's family. Any of us in today's world could find ourselves facing the difficult and challenging set of decisions this family had to make. Strongin's story is a truthful and honest road map we may want to follow.\"--Dr. Ranit Mishori, contributing health editor, Parade Magazine; professor, Georgetown University School of Medicine",

The findings reviewed here go beyond academic achievement, covering students' civic engagement, cost comparisons across school types, and public and parental opinion about schools and school choice.

        "Description": "In From a Dark Sky: The Story of U.S. Air Force Special Operations military affairs specialist Orr Kelly tells for the first time the complete, uncensored history of Air Force special operations: a history that had been up to now shrouded in cover stories, secrecy, and deception. Whether they called themselves Air Commandos, Carpetbaggers, or Ravens, they were the ones called on to do the \"impossible\" jobs - that other Air Force units couldn't, or wouldn't, do.Whether these missions involved flying behind enemy lines or introducing unique new weapons such as the fixed-wing AC-47 gunship or the Pave Low helicopter, the air commandos have been a vital part of America's modern war-waging capability. Kelly describes the action going back to the 1940s when the Army Air Force provided aerial aid to anti-Nazi partisans and successfully extracted scores of downed American pilots. Helicopter insertion of agents into enemy territory during the Korean War, clandestine CIA missions in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, infiltrating intelligence teams during Desert Storm, and current-day operations throughout the world are all included in this exciting and unique history.",
