        "Description": "Dr. Andrew Fenimore is a Philadelphia general physician who still makes house calls - even when they're in New Jersey - and whose resume, were he to be so immodest as to prepare one, would include triumphs over wicked Homo sapiens as well as dangerous bacillae. In other words, he's a crack amateur detective.It has been his habit to call his Czech cousin every week, and he is especially eager to be in touch with her and her family now, as Anna is to bring her husband, Vlasta, to Philadelphia for heart surgery soon. When he is unable to reach them, he immediately flies back to Prague. If his concern is misplaced, well, he'd always meant to visit the \"most beautiful city in Europe,\" where his mother grew up.One small mystery is solved almost immediately when the doctor finds the apartment inhabited. For two weeks, Anna's nine-year-old daughter, Marie, has been hiding there, sleeping in the giant oven of the traditional stove, living on crackers and whatever else she could find in the pantry since two men with guns had taken her parents away.Fenimore smuggles young Marie off to Philadelphia, where his secretary, Mrs. Doyle, will care for her, and remains in Prague to find Anna and Vlasta. He looks up one of their colleagues at the university - a large, loud, and somewhat frighteningly flirtatious woman who insists on taking him sightseeing. He can only hope that the tour she takes him on will lead to information about his relatives. Instead, it leads him, first, to a puppet show (a popular feature of Czech culture) on the life of the Emperor Charles IV, and from there into a disturbing maelstrom of crazed ambition and a terrorist plan that would devastate the city. With luck Fenimore is able to block the plan and find his family, but only after the murder of a Czech citizen and a threat to Fenimore's own freedom - and possibly his life.",

One of the most celebrated treasures of world literature as well, it is in the form of a poetic dialogue between the epic's hero, Arjuna, and his friend Krishna, believed to be an incarnation of God.The dialogue, which takes place on the eve of an historic battle, probes the nature of God and what man should do to reach him. As the Bhagavadgita unfolds, this majestic poem provides a fascinating synopsis of the religious thought and experience of India through the ages. This edition offers the classic English verse translation by Sir Edwin Arnold (1832\u20131904), long admired for its evocation of the true feeling of the original poetry.",

        "Description": "From an acclaimed conservative historian and former military officer, a bracing call for a pragmatic confrontation with the nation's problemsThe Limits of Power identifies a profound triple crisis facing America: the economy, in remarkable disarray, can no longer be fixed by relying on expansion abroad; the government, transformed by an imperial presidency, is a democracy in form only; U.S. involvement in endless wars, driven by a deep infatuation with military power, has been a catastrophe for the body politic. These pressing problems threaten all of us, Republicans and Democrats. If the nation is to solve its predicament, it will need the revival of a distinctly American approach: the neglected tradition of realism.Andrew J. Bacevich, uniquely respected across the political spectrum, offers a historical perspective on the illusions that have governed American policy since 1945. The realism he proposes includes respect for power and its limits; sensitivity to unintended consequences; aversion to claims of exceptionalism; skepticism of easy solutions, especially those involving force; and a conviction that the books will have to balance. Only a return to such principles, Bacevich argues, can provide common ground for fixing America\u2019s urgent problems before the damage becomes irreparable.",

        "Authors": "By Schorr, Lisbeth B.",
        "Description": "In her previous book, Within Our Reach, renowned Harvard social analyst Lisbeth Schorr examined pilot social programs that were successful in helping disadvantaged youth and families. But as those cutting-edge programs were expanded, the very qualities that had made them initially successful were jettisoned, and less than half of them ultimately survived. As a result, these groundbreaking programs never made a dent on the national or statewide level.Lisbeth Schorr has spent the past seven years researching and identifying large-scale programs across the country that are promising to reduce, on a community- or citywide level, child abuse, school failure, teenage pregnancy, and welfare dependence. From reformed social service agencies in Missouri, Michigan, and Los Angeles to \"idiosyncratic\" public schools in New York City, she shows how private and public bureaucracies are successfully nurturing programs that are flexible and responsive to the community, that have set clear, long-term goals, and that permit staff to exercise individual judgment in helping the disadvantaged. She shows how what works in small-scale pilot social programs can be adapted on a large scale to transform whole inner-city neighborhoods and reshape America.On the heels of the federal government's dismantling of welfare guarantees, Common Purpose offers a welcome antidote to our current sense of national despair, and concrete proof that America's social institutions can be made to work to assure that all the nation's children develop the tools to share in the American dream.",

Each chapter ends with a summary, checklist, and writing projects that allow students to apply what they learn. In addition to guidance on drafting and revising arguments, the authors provide a variety of composition strategies, from free-writing to outlining. Active reading tools, such as note-taking, summary writing, and shared reading, are also encouraged.",

The Watchman put Joe   Pike, Elvis Cole's strong, taciturn partner, front and center, and not only won Robert Crais new audiences but   remarkable reviews. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel said \"Robert Crais elevates crime fiction\" and now with   The First Rule he does it again. The organized criminal gangs of the former Soviet Union are   bound by what they call the thieves' code. The first rule is this: A thief must forsake his mother, father, brothers, and   sisters. He must have no family-no wife, no children. We are his family. If any of the rules are broken, it is   punishable by death. Frank Meyer had the American dream-until the day a professional crew invaded his   home and murdered everyone inside. The only thing out of the ordinary about Meyer was that- before the family and   the business and the normal life-a younger Frank Meyer had worked as a professional mercenary, with a man   named Joe Pike. The police think Meyer was hiding something very bad, but Pike does not. With the help of Cole, he   sets out on a hunt of his own-an investigation that quickly entangles them both in a web of ancient grudges, blood   ties, blackmail, vengeance, double crosses, and cutthroat criminal\u00adity, and at the heart of it, an act so terrible even   Pike and Cole have no way to measure it. Sometimes, the past is never dead. It's not even past. The   First Rule is the most astonishing novel yet from the master of the crime thriller.    Watch a Video",

        "Authors": "By Alfonsi, Christian",
        "Description": "An important, massively researched and revelation-filled work of history that uncovers how decisions made by the first Bush White House preordained the current administration\u2019s decision to invade Iraq.\u201cIs this a one-time thing, or should we foreshadow more to come?\u201dThis was the prophetic question posed by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft in a secret April 1991 memorandum about the postwar management of Iraq, two months after the United States had defeated Iraqi forces in Operation Desert Storm\u2014but left Saddam Hussein securely in power. Circle in the Sand challenges the widely held notion that Saddam\u2019s survival was the result of a spur-of-the-moment decision by the first President Bush and his inner circle (especially the \u201cReluctant Warrior\u201d Colin Powell) to call off the Desert Storm campaign \"one day too soon.\" Through interviews with the Bush team\u2019s principal decision makers\u2014including President George H.W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Brent Scowcroft, and Paul Wolfowitz\u2014as well as hundreds of never-before-revealed White House documents, Christian Alfonsi shows how Saddam\u2019s survival was the result of a calculated decision, albeit one with disastrous consequences, which had settled the issue of how the first Iraq war would end long before it even began. Circle in the Sand also provides the definitive account of the collapse of the first Bush administration\u2019s Iraq policy after the war.Unprecedented in its detail about the decision making inside the Bush White House during the first Gulf War, Circle in the Sand provides not only a dramatic portrait of history in the making but also a compelling rationale for the United States\u2019 mishandling of the current situation in Iraq. Did we invade Iraq in 2003 to ensure that George W. Bush would not suffer an electoral fate in 2004 similar to his father\u2019s defeat in 1992? Circle in the Sand forces us to consider that disturbing scenario and its larger implications for the American war on terror.",

        "Authors": "By Florida, Richard",
        "Description": "The Washington Monthly 2002 Annual Political Book Award WinnerThe Rise of the Creative Class gives us a provocative new way to think about why we live as we do today-and where we might be headed. Weaving storytelling with masses of new and updated research, Richard Florida traces the fundamental theme that runs through a host of seemingly unrelated changes in American society: the growing role of creativity in our economy.Just as William Whyte's 1956 classic The Organization Man showed how the organizational ethos of that age permeated every aspect of life, Florida describes a society in which the creative ethos is increasingly dominant. Millions of us are beginning to work and live much as creative types like artists and scientists always have-with the result that our values and tastes, our personal relationships, our choices of where to live, and even our sense and use of time are changing. Leading the shift are the nearly 38 million Americans in many diverse fields who create for a living-the Creative Class.The Rise of the Creative Class chronicles the ongoing sea of change in people's choices and attitudes, and shows not only what's happening but also how it stems from a fundamental economic change. The Creative Class now comprises more than thirty percent of the entire workforce. Their choices have already had a huge economic impact. In the future they will determine how the workplace is organized, what companies will prosper or go bankrupt, and even which cities will thrive or wither.",

That was why he'd stopped. That was what he'd been watching as the rest of them waited in uneasy silence.\"Yes,\" Richard said. He gestured over his shoulder without turning to look. \"There are two more, back there.\"Kahlan briefly scanned the dark jumble of rock, but she didn't see any others.Lightly grasping the silver pommel with two fingers, Richard lifted his sword a few inches, checking that it was clear in its scabbard. A last fleeting glimmer of amber light played across his golden cape as he let the sword drop back in place. In the gathering gloom of dusk, his familiar tall, powerful contour seemed as if it were no more than an apparition made of shadows.Just then, two more of the huge birds shot by right overhead. One, wings stretched wide, let out a piercing scream as it banked into a tight gliding turn, circling once more in assessment of the five people below before stroking its powerful wings to catch its departing comrades in their swift journey west.This night they would find ample food.",

In Colt Blood.When Nattie's boss at the Charlotte Commercial Appeal orders her to find a local horse whisperer to interview, she knows just the person: yellow-haired New Age belle Sarah Jane Lowell, one of the gifted few who claims to have a psychic connection to horses. She not only talks to them, she hears what they answer. Unfortunately, before Nattie can set up a meeting, Sarah Jane vanishes along with her newfound friend: Nattie's eccentric father.Disturbingly, their sudden disappearance coincides with the brutal murder of Fuzzy McMahon, whose bludgeoned body was found at the very stable where Nattie was supposed to meet Sarah Jane. True, Fuzzy was less than popular, but who would stoop to such a bloody act of violence? Although suspicion has fallen on dark-horse candidate Sarah Jane, Nattie's splitting her money between two other front-runners: blacksmith Bobby McMahon, Fuzzy's redneck of a husband, and his tiresome cousin, Jason Sukon, who can only gain by her death--specifically millions of dollars.A sophisticated tale of reckless romance and irretrievable violence, In Cold Blood goes beyond murder to explore the mysteries of fear, love, lust, and hate. And as always, when it comes to the manners and morals of the New South, mystery author Jody Jaffe gets it right every time.",

        "Description": "The Wordy Shipmates is New York Times?bestselling author Sarah Vowell?s exploration of the Puritans and their journey to America to become the people of John Winthrop?s ?city upon a hill??a shining example, a ?city that cannot be hid.? To this day, America views itself as a Puritan nation, but Vowell investigates what that means? and what it should mean. What was this great political enterprise all about? Who were these people who are considered the philosophical, spiritual, and moral ancestors of our nation? What Vowell discovers is something far different from what their uptight shoe-buckles-and- corn reputation might suggest. The people she finds are highly literate, deeply principled, and surprisingly feisty. Their story is filled with pamphlet feuds, witty courtroom dramas, and bloody vengeance. Along the way she asks: *  Was Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop a communitarian, a Christlike Christian, or conformity?s tyrannical enforcer? Answer: Yes! *  Was Rhode Island?s architect, Roger Williams, America?s founding freak or the father of the First Amendment? Same difference. *  What does it take to get that jezebel Anne Hutchinson to shut up? A hatchet. *  What was the Puritans? pet name for the Pope? The Great Whore of Babylon. Sarah Vowell?s special brand of armchair history makes the bizarre and esoteric fascinatingly relevant and fun. She takes us from the modern-day reenactment of an Indian massacre to the Mohegan Sun casino, from old-timey Puritan poetry, where ?righteousness? is rhymed with ?wilderness,? to a Mayflower-themed waterslide. Throughout, The Wordy Shipmates is rich in historical fact, humorous insight, and social commentary by one of America?s most celebrated voices. Thou shalt enjoy it.",

I wish I\u2019d had the honor of working on this book with him. But then, he didn\u2019t need me.\u201d---Ron Powers, New York Times bestselling coauthor of Flags of Our Fathers and author of Mark Twain: A Life\u201cA beautifully crafted anthem to doomed American youth, James Carl Nelson\u2019s The Remains of Company D is a must-read for World War I enthusiasts and those looking for a damn good war book.\u201d---Alex Kershaw, New York Times bestselling author of The Longest Winter and The Bedford Boys\u201cWar is always hell, but the unprecedented carnage on World War I\u2019s Western Front was the stuff of nightmares. The American boys of Company D were on the front lines, and James Carl Nelson has combined previously unpublished first-person accounts, prodigious research, and vivid, you-are-there prose into one of the great books on the subject. This is a Band of Brothers for World War I.\u201d---James Donovan, author of A Terrible Glory: Custer and the Little Bighorn\u2014the Last Great Battle of the American West\u201cJames Carl Nelson\u2019s book is a great contribution to AEF history. He has done an incredible amount of research in order to convey the experience of one group of doughboys...and to tell their story through their own words.\u2026.He reminds us that these long-forgotten battles of ninety years ago were as hard fought as any before or since, and that our country was well served by the young men who fought them. Get this book. It puts a very human face on the experience of Americans on the Western Front.\u201d---Dr. Paul Herbert, executive director of the Cantigny First Division FoundationHaunted by an ancestor\u2019s tale of near death on a distant battlefield, James Carl Nelson set out in pursuit of the scraps of memory of his grandfather\u2019s small infantry unit. Years of travel across the world led to the retrieval of unpublished personal papers, obscure memoirs, and communications from numerous Doughboys as well as original interviews of the descendents of his grandfather\u2019s comrades in arms. The result is a compelling tale of battle rooted in new primary sources, and one man\u2019s search for his grandfather\u2019s legacy in a horrifying maelstrom that is today poorly understood and nearly forgotten.The Remains of Company D follows the members of Company D, 28th Infantry Regiment, United States First Division, from enlistment to combat to the effort to recover their remains, focusing on the three major battles at Cantigny, Soissons, and in the Meuse-Argonne and the effect these horrific battles had on the men. This is an important and powerful tale of the different destinies, personalities, and motivations of the men in Company D and a timeless portrayal of men at war.",
