        "Description": "This Nutshell Handbook\u00ae is far and away the most comprehensive book  ever written on sendmail, the program that acts like a traffic cop in  routing and delivering mail on UNIX-based networks. Although sendmail  is used on almost every UNIX system, it's one of the last great  uncharted territories--and most difficult utilities to learn-- in UNIX system administration.This book provides a complete sendmail tutorial, plus extensive  reference material on every aspect of the program. What's more, it's  authoritative, having been co-authored by Eric Allman, the developer  of sendmail, and Neil Rickert, one of the leading sendmail gurus on  the Net.This book covers both IDA sendmail and the latest version (V8)  from the University of California, Berkeley. It also covers the standard versions available on most systems, such as those found on Sun and DEC/Ultrix workstations.The book is divided into four parts. Part One is a tutorial on  understanding sendmail from the ground up; starting from  an empty file, it has the reader work through exercises, building  a configuration file and testing the results. Part Two covers practical  issues in sendmail administration. Part Three is a comprehensive  reference section, while Part Four consists of appendices and a bibliography.",

        "Description": "A Traveller's History of China provides a concise and fascinating journey from the country's earliest beginning right up to the creation of the economic powerhouse that is modern day China.Stephen Haw carries the reader back in time to the prehistoric civilizations of 4,000 years ago, to the centuries of China's silk trade with the less developed countries of Europe. Some of the most significant inventions of the pre-modern world, including paper, gunpowder, and the magnetic compass, originated in China and were then transmitted to the West. The author describes the glories of the Tang and Song dynasties, which saw the creation of the great Chinese cities to the period of its decline and the efforts of Europe to conquer and subdue this giant land. It covers the tumult and triumphs of the Chinese revolution and the dramatic changes in political policies since the late 1970s, which have now made it one of the world's fastest developing countries.A comprehensive and illuminating look at the rich history of this dynamic country and an easy-to-use reference source.",

Chapters cover the effect of the garden outside, color, entertaining, wicker, and other furniture, pools and fountains, antiques and statuary.  The more technical considerations of wall and floor finishes, heating and lighting, rugs and blinds-and of course, planting under glass-are all discussed in detail for a well-considered room.Filled with inspiring color photographs of relaxed interiors, Garden Room Style is a sumptuous guide and idea book for everyone who has a sunny, light-filled haven-and is a vivid wish book for readers planning for the future.",

The only person to penetrate her thick shell is Mick Crabbe, with whom she's had a decade-long affair. He's a charming guy\u2014famous even, a well-known college basketball coach\u2014but the fact that they live in different states and see each other only once a week, and that Mick is committed not only to his wife and kids, but also to his basketball team and all those fans, suits Genie just fine. She can take care of herself. She doesn't need him.That is, until Mick becomes fatally ill and the nature of their relationship is forced to change. Genie sets her heart free for the first time and is ultimately altered by the experience. As she becomes intimately involved in Mick's care, and makes herself known to his family, Genie finally understands the importance of making connections with others, and earns, even from the outside world, the extremely moving validation of her significance in Mick's life.Narrated with the warmth, humor, and compassion that readers have come to expect from Martha Moody,\u00a0Sometimes Mine\u00a0is an emotionally engaging story of learning to appreciate the value of the people in your life, and the realization that sometimes the most meaningful relationships are those that go unrecognized.",

Exploring this ancient British crossroads beside the Thames, Jan Morris--a distinguished travel writer and novelist--focuses on the richly-mixed heritage of city and University, replete with ongoing battles between \"Town and Gown.\" She investigates the spirit and pride of each individual Oxford college; offers detailed descriptions of the flora and fauna, especially in the Oxford Botanical Garden, the oldest of its kind in Great Britain; depicts the pleasures and recreations, as well as the education and scholarship, of the students; and traces the city and the University's Christian roots.  Her witty prose reveals the Oxford which gave the world the MG sports car and  educated twenty-two British Prime Ministers.       This newly revised edition brings up to date a portrait of a small city which has given its name to a marmalade, bags, a gray, shoes, a Group, a Movement, a dictionary, and an accent.",

        "Authors": "By Vesperman, Jennifer",
        "Description": "CVS, the Concurrent Versions System, is the popular source-code management tool that frees developers from the chaos that too often ensues when multiple users work on the same file. An open source technology that is available on most computer platforms, including Windows\u00ae and Mac OS\u00ae X, CVS is widely used to manage program code, web site content, and to track changes made to system configuration files. Multiple users can check out files from a directory tree, make changes, and then commit those changes back into the directory. If two developers modify the same file, CVS enables both sets of changes to be merged together into one final file. Although CVS is a lifesaver in many development scenarios, it suffers from poor documentation. But with Essential CVS, developers can have it all: the order that CVS brings and the comprehensive documentation developers need.Essential CVS is a complete and easy-to-follow reference that helps programmers and system administrators apply order to the task of managing large quantities of documents. The book covers basic concepts and usage of CVS, and features a comprehensive reference for CVS commands--including a handy Command Reference Card for quick, on-the-job checks. The book also includes advanced information on all aspects of CVS that involve automation, logging, branching and merging, and \"watches.\"  Readers will find in-depth coverage of the following:Installing CVS and building your first repositoryBasic use of CVS, including importing projects, checking out projects, committing changes, and updating projectsTagging, branching and mergingWorking with multiple usersClients, operating systems, and IDEsRepository management and managing remote repositoriesProject administration, including bug tracking systems, enforcing log messages, history and annotation, and more.TroubleshootingVersion control is essential to maintaining order in any project, large or small. Any CVS user, from beginners to team leaders and system administrators, will find this practical guide to CVS indispensable in getting the most from this valuable tool.",

In 1968, into the devastating, spare atmosphere of the remote coastal town of Labrador, Canada, a child is born: a baby who appears to be neither fully boy nor fully girl, but both at once. Only three people are privy to the secret?the baby\u2019s parents, Jacinta and Treadway, and a trusted neighbor and midwife, Thomasina. Though Treadway makes the difficult decision to raise the child as a boy named Wayne, the women continue to quietly nurture the boy\u2019s female side. And as Wayne grows into adulthood within the hyper-masculine hunting society of his father, his shadow-self, a girl he thinks of as ?Annabel,\u201d is never entirely extinguished. Kathleen Winter has crafted a literary gem about the urge to unveil mysterious truth in a culture that shuns contradiction, and the body\u2019s insistence on coming home.

With unmatched patience and a pulsating intensity, Alice LaPlante brings us deep into a brilliant woman\u2019s deteriorating mind, where the impossibility of recognizing reality can be both a blessing and a curse.As the book opens, Dr. Jennifer White\u2019s best friend, Amanda, who lived down the block, has been killed, and four fingers surgically removed from her hand. Dr. White is the prime suspect and she herself doesn\u2019t know whether she did it. Told in White\u2019s own voice, fractured and eloquent, a picture emerges of the surprisingly intimate, complex alliance between these life-long friends?two proud, forceful women who were at times each other\u2019s most formidable adversaries. As the investigation into the murder deepens and White\u2019s relationships with her live-in caretaker and two grown children intensify, a chilling question lingers: is White\u2019s shattered memory preventing her from revealing the truth or helping her to hide it?A startling portrait of a disintegrating mind clinging to bits of reality through anger, frustration, shame, and unspeakable loss, Turn of Mind is a remarkable debut that examines the deception and frailty of memory and how it defines our very existence.",

In this fanciful and festive recreation of Elizabethan Stratford, Bruce Koscielniak brings the spirit of the times alive with fun-filled pictures and Shakespeare's own incomparable words, here made accessible to young readers.",
