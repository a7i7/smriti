For the millions of Americans who have put off planning and saving for retirement, financial writer Ellen Hoffman relates 54 real-life success stories so that readers can get some ideas about what they can do to catch up right now, without a calculator, no matter what their financial resources. Designed in a very readable, very accessible format, without resorting to abstract charts and financial formulas, The Retirement Catch-Up Guide reveals how finding a \"lost\" pension, creating a retirement vision, setting up a reverse mortgage or a small business, and dozens of other strategies can help late starters build their retirement assets.",

As descendants of the House of Life, the Kanes have some powers at their command; but the devious gods haven't given them time to master their skills at Brooklyn House, a training ground for young magicians. And now their most threatening enemy yet--the Chaos snake, Apophis--is rising. If they don't prevent him from breaking free in a few days' time, the world will end. In other words, it's a typical week for the Kane family.      To have any chance of battling the forces of Chaos, the Kanes must revive the sun god, Ra. But that would be a feat more difficult than any magician has ever accomplished. First they have to search the world for the Book of Ra, then they have to learn how to chant its spells. Oh, and did we mention that no one knows where Ra is, exactly?     Narrated by two different wisecracking voices, featuring a large cast of new and unforgettable characters, and with adventures spanning the globe, this second installment of the Kane Chronicles is nothing short of a thrill ride.",

        "Description": "Scholar, critic, travel companion, confidant.... For over twenty years Father Leopoldo Duran played all these roles in the life of Graham Greene. Their journeys together provided the inspiration for one of Greene's greatest novels, Monsignor Quixote, which is dedicated to Duran. But above all they were friends, and it was their mutual admiration and common faith that bound these two spiritual men together.In Graham Greene, Duran uses the chronicles of their twenty-seven-year relationship to expose and reflect upon the very private Greene kept hidden from his fans and critics alike. During their annual pilgrimages through Spain and Portugal these two men formed a friendship unparalleled for Greene. Duran draws on the letters, notes, and journals that document this relationship to offer glimpses into Greene's personal life and to reveal the humor, warmth, and sensitivity of this cultural icon.But it is Greene's controversial postures on faith and ideology that interest Duran the most, and these serve as the common thread through Duran's anecdotes and musings in Graham Greene. Although a convert to Roman Catholicism, Greene had notorious differences with the Church that were never publicly reconciled. By recalling their private conversations, Duran covers all the incendiary topics - from contraception and celibacy to Communism.It is apparent from their first meeting, when Greene asks, \"Do you think I have true faith?\" how much he valued Duran's judgment. Green's later statements, \"I can fully trust you to present me as a living person,\" and \"I do hope that... you will be able to continue writing and lecturing on my work - for no one knows better than you do its nature and its source,\" are further evidence of his complete confidence in Duran.Graham Greene is the book that Greene wanted to be written about himself, the book that illuminates the soul and the spirit of this remarkable man.",

This is the logical follow-up, an innovative baby book that will guide and reassure new moms and dads through every nuance of the first 12 months of life with baby. Of course, it maintains all the design elements that are the signature of the Great Expectations series and have proven so appealing: innovative graphics; clear-cut, contemporary styling; and sensitive drawings of babies as they develop month-by-month. The text, too, continues that same friendly, supportive, parent-to-parent tone of the earlier book\u2014but now with dads playing an integral role. Inside, there\u2019s a plethora of information on the nuts and bolts of feeding, diaper changing, and immunizations, as well as cutting-edge research on baby intelligence and development, nutrition and medical care, and insights into the dynamics of the parenting process. Checklists, bulleted sidebars, and quick-reference tables speed up the process of finding needed information. Unique tables in the extensive medical reference section will present the gamut of symptoms, so parents will have help distinguishing between common baby ailments and more serious emergencies that may require immediate attention. Includes a foreword by Dr. Michael Crocetti, Assistant Professor and Director of Clinical Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, and also an extended resource guide and parent\u2019s dictionary.",

This encouraging change not only has benefited veterans but also provides a blueprint for salvaging America's own deeply troubled healthcare system. \"Best Care Anywhere\" shows how a government bureaucracy, working with little notice, is setting the standard for best practices and cost reduction while the private sector is lagging in both areas. Author Phillip Longman challenges conventional wisdom by explaining exactly how market forces work to lower quality and raise prices in the healthcare sector, and how U.S. medical practices have a weak basis in science. The book, expanded from a widely praised article in the \"Washington Monthly,\" mixes hard facts with author Philip Longmans' compelling human story of the loss of his wife to cancer. Part manifesto, part moving memoir, \"Best Care Anywhere\" offers new hope for addressing a major problem of contemporary society that affects all of us.",

        "Description": "In The Borderlands of Science, Michael Shermer takes us to the place where real science, borderline science--and just plain nonsense--collide. Shermer argues that while science is the best lens through which to view the world, it is often difficult to decipher where valid science leaves off and borderland, or \"fuzzy\" science begins. To solve this dilemma, he looks at a range of topics that put this boundary line in high relief. For instance, he debunks the many \"theories of everything\" that try to reduce the complexity of the world to a single principle. He examines the work of Darwin and Freud, explaining why one is among the great scientists in history, while the other has become nothing more than a historical curiosity. And he reveals how scientists themselves can be led astray, as seen in the infamous Piltdown hoax--the set of ancient hominid bones discovered in England that after decades turned out to be an enormous forgery.From SETI and acupuncture to hypnosis and human cloning, this enlightening book will help readers stay grounded in common sense amid the flurry of supposedly scientific theories that inundate us every day.",

The girl, who is his mistress, is very young and very beautiful. Sitting there, with drinks in their hands, watching the sunset, the Slades seem to be experiencing the sort of fortunate chance encounter that travelers cherish. But amidst the civilities and small talk, one remark proves prophetic. The host says to the American woman: \"It's not exactly what you think.\" Masterfully -- with the poetic control that has always characterized his work -- Paul Bowles leads the reader beneath the surface of hospitality and luxury into a tortuous maze of human relationships and shifting moods, until what seems at first a merely casual encounter is seen to be one rooted in viciousness and horror.",

        "Authors": "By Tushman, Michael L., Nadler, David, and Nadler, Mark B.",
        "Description": "If the defining goal of modern-day business can be isolated to just one item, it would be the search for competitive advantage. And, as everyone in business knows, it's a lot harder than it used to be. On the one hand, competition is more intense than ever--technological innovation, consumer expectations, government deregulation, all combine to create more opportunities for new competitors to change the basic rules of the game. On the other hand, most of the old reliable sources of competitive advantage are drying up: the hallowed strategies employed by GM, IBM, and AT&T to maintain their seemingly unassailable positions of dominance in the 1960s and 70s are as obsolete as the calvary charge. So in this volatile, unstable environment, where can competitive advantage be found?As David Nadler and Michael Tushman show, the last remaining source of truly sustainable competitive advantage lies in \"organizational capabilities\": the unique ways each organization structures its work and motivates its people to achieve clearly articulated strategic objectives. For too long, too many managers have thought about \"organization\" merely in terms of rearranging the boxes and lines on an organizational chart--but asCompeting by Design clearly illustrates, organizational strength is found far beyond one-dimensional diagrams. Managers must, argue Nadler and Tushman, understand the concepts and learn the skills involved in designing their organization to exploit their inherent strengths. All the reengineering, restructuring, and downsizing in the world will merely destabilize a company if the change doesn't address the fundamental patterns of performance--and if the change doesn't recognize the unique core competencies of that company. In this landmark volume, the authors draw upon specific cases to illustrate the design process in practice as they provide a set of powerful, yet simple tools, for using strategic organization design to gain competitive advantage. They present a design process, explore key decisions managers face, and list the guiding principles for incorporating the design function as a continuing and integral process in organizations that are looking to the future.In 1918, Henry Ford's Dearborn assembly plant was the model of the new assembly-line technology. Today, the assembly plant is an aging relic, but, incredibly, the organizational architecture it spawned lives on in steep hierarchies, centralized bureaucracies, and narrowly defined jobs. As companies are coming to realize they can't compete successfully in the 21st century with organizations based on 19th century ideas,Competing by Design shows clearly and persuasively why--and, most importantlyhow--to harness the power of organizational architecture to unleash the competitive strengths embedded in each organization.",

Sadly, the result was fear, distrust, paranoia, and low employee and manager morale.Business's greatest blunder of the last decade has been the belief, backed by billions of dollars invested, that technology and organizational strategies would solve the problem of flat productivity. They didn't!The reason is painfully simple. Those strategies overlooked the most basic factor in success: the productive potential of people. Processes and organizational strategies don't produce, people do. But they only do it in the right environment, with positive leadership.The People Principle brings this powerful, simple, clear message to you, along with ways to lead people that promote creativity and high productivity.In this book you'll learn:* Why 80 percent of your people are performing far below their capabilities right now, and what to do about it* How to create an environment in which people perform their best* How to foster high achievement drive and motivation in your people* Why ethical, value-driven behaviors are good for businessWhether you manage two people ot two thousand, in a cottage industry or a Fortune 500 company, Ron Willingham's book will help you maximize your employees' productivity and, in doing so, boost your career and your company's bottom line.",

        "Description": "Sizzling saut\u00e9 pans. Screaming spectators. Television cameras. A ticking clock.Fasten your seatbelt for the Bocuse d'Or, the world's most challenging and prestigious cooking competition, where the pressure and the stakes could not be higher. At this real-life Top Chef, twenty-four culinary teams, each representing its home nation, cook for five and a half grueling hours. There are no elimination rounds, no time to ease into the rigors of competition. The teams have just one precious chance to cook and present two spectacular platters of food, then plate them for tasting by a jury of chefs -- the ultimate test of their ability to execute their craft, with prize money, international acclaim, and national pride on the line.Surprisingly, although American cuisine now rates among the best in the world, a U.S. team has never finished among the top three at this \"Olympics of Food.\" In 2008, a triumvirate of culinary figures -- Daniel Boulud, Thomas Keller, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bocuse -- raised unprecedented support and awareness for the American effort. This is their story, and the story of the team that competed for the United States at the 2009 Bocuse d'Or -- what they did, how they did it, and what they learned.Knives at Dawn chronicles the formation and training of the 2009 American team. Chef Timothy Hollingsworth and his assistant, or commis, Adina Guest, both from The French Laundry in Yountville, California, are the stars of this chefs-as-athletes story. After winning a national team selection event, the pair trained in a specially outfitted facility, while twenty-three competitors -- including a Norwegian who'd been hell-bent to win the Bocuse d'Or since the age of twelve -- rehearsed around the globe. The days of the competition, when they all come together in an arena in Lyon, France, are recounted in riveting detail -- putting you right alongside the action -- as the months of toil and aspiration come to a head in the final hours of fierce cooking, when technical and mental fortitude, split-second decision-making, or a few too many seconds of heat can make all the difference in the world.Beyond the American team itself, unparalleled behind-the-scenes access allows sports journalist and food writer Andrew Friedman to paint intimate portraits of Boulud and Keller, two of the most influential culinary figures of their generation, as well as of French icon Paul Bocuse, who created the competition more than two decades ago. With its revealing look at chefs and cooks of different generations and nationalities, Knives at Dawn delivers fascinating insights into what drives chefs to cook and compete, both in the Bocuse d'Or and in their own kitchens every day.",
