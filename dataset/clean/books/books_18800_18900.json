Informed by his deep understanding of the gravity of these issues and the global stakes, 9-11 demonstrates Chomsky's impeccable knowledge of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and South Asia, and sheds light on the rapidly shifting balance of world power. Speaking out against escalating violence, Chomsky critically examines the United States' own foreign policy record and considers what international institutions might be employed against underground networks and national states accused of terrorism. 9-11's analysis still stands as a measure of how well the media is able to serve its role of informing the citizenry, so crucial to our democracy in times of war.",

        "Authors": "By Kopp, Raymond J. and Smith, V. Kerry (EDT)",
        "Description": "Assessing natural resource damages often requires the use of nonmarket valuation techniques that were developed for use in benefit-cost analyses. Natural resource damage assessment dramatically changes the context for applying them. Two aspects of this context are especially important. First, damages are to be measured by the monetary value of the losses people experience, including their use and nonuse values, because of injuries to natural resources---a process requiring careful delineation of how the injuries connect to the resource's services. Second, a single identified entry---not generalized, anonymous taxpayers---must pay damages based on what is measured, and evaluations of the measurement techniques take place not in agency meeting rooms but in courtrooms.Contributors to Valuing Natural Assets examine the ways in which requirements for damage assessment change how the measures are used, presented, received, and defended. Drawing upon their personal involvement with the process and the research issues it has raised---both in providing analysis for defendants or plaintiffs in damage assessment cases and in writing for academic journals---their chapters reflect individual research programs that temper the rigorous demands of scholarship with the equally demanding standards of litigation.",

There seemed little he could hope for since the evidence was so incriminating. Even old Wystan - head of Chambers, father of Hilda and conducting Jerrold's defense - seemed to have given up the game. But not Rumpole. There was something about the evidence that bothered him and, though he was only Wystan's junior in the case, when the time came for him to seize the initiative, he did it triumphantly.",

He was not alone: over 700 embedded news reporters planned on locking step with the military, and multitudes more, biding their time until Baghdad fell, would follow in their wake. In this gin-soaked yet scrupulously honest look at a reporter in wartime, Feuer describes this international media swarm, not to mention the local opportunists and unscrupulous profiteers, to exhilarating and profound effect. In these pages you'll meet a desert Donald Trump, the stiletto-heeled Rania (who'll bribe aborder guard or introduce you to the Queen - all for the right price) as well as the Times bureau chiefs who decide what, and how much of it, is fit to print. Clear-eyed and ever cognizant of the moral quicksand that surrounds him, Feuer recounts the interactions that form the news in stylish prose wedded to a wry, dry wit.",

In lush, lyrical prose, Greene recalls their experiences turning the 300-year-old stone building -- a \"ch\u00e2teau in miniature\" that the locals believe houses numerous spirits-into a habitable refuge. He brings to life their adventures in finding wonderful bargains with which to furnish their new space, including a firm mattress and some rather suspicious antiques\" bought from the back of a van.Greene offers the unexpected joys and surprises of village life, from celebrating his and Mary's simple backyard wedding to toiling in a verdant garden. He shares the experience of surviving his mother's decision to move in and humorously introduces the locals -- both human and nonhuman -- who define his and Mary's new world.Woven throughout this luscious tale are the pleasures of rural France: wondrous food and wine, long-held rituals and feasts, dark superstitions, and deeply rooted history.",

        "Title": "The World of the Autistic Child : Understanding and Treating Autistic Spectrum Disorders",
        "Authors": "By Siegel, Bryna",
        "Description": "For thousands of loving and concerned parents of autistic children, the suspicion that something may be wrong comes long before the clinical diagnosis of autism, PDD (pervasive developmental disorder), or Asperger's syndrome. When rounds of testing and consultations confirm parents' worst fears, their emotional turmoil is matched by an overriding practical concern: What do we do next?The World of the Autistic Child is by far the most complete and comprehensive book ever written for the parents of autistic children, and for the teachers, child specialists, and other professionals that care for them. Written by Dr. Bryna Siegel, a developmental psychologist and director of a large university clinic for autistic children, it provides help and hope not only for the children, but for their families--the parents, grandparents, siblings, and other caregivers who must come to grips with their own grief and confusion following a diagnosis of autism or other related disorder. Dr. Siegel believes that parents' best defense is to acquire, as early as possible, the knowledge and the parenting skills they will need to work with professionals to help their child fulfill his or her potential. This book, therefore, is about understanding the diagnosis of autism, the available treatments, and how to decide what is best for a particular child with autism or PDD.Straightforward and sympathetic, Dr. Siegel guides readers through the thicket of symptoms and labels, explaining the crucial importance of intensive early education, and how to find the resources and help that are available. Behavior modification, the development of daily living skills, guidelines for selecting and designing schooling, mainstreaming, the role for traditional academics in educating higher functioning children and young people, building effective parent-teacher relationships, psychoactive medications, and dealing with the possibility of residential placement are all covered. Dr. Siegel teaches parents and professionals to use their own common sense and personal observations in evaluating the many highly publicized but unorthodox and often untested treatments for autism, including the much-touted facilitated communication (F/C), holding therapy, auditory training, \"Options\" therapy, allergy treatments, and special diets. Pulling together a wealth of long-needed information on the latest educational and medical advances, The World of the Autistic Child is a superb guide and resource that no one who cares about autistic or developmentally disabled young people will want to be without.",

He was tall but seemed world-weary. His entire earthly possessions fit into two suitcases. He was a down-and-out crime reporter willing to cover any minor beat if it could get him back into newspapering.  Then, almost overnight, peculiar circumstances made him the richest man in northeast central United States.  All that money made Qwilleran nervous, until he remembered the old saying: \"Money is like muck; it doesn't do any good unless you spread it around.\" He established a foundation to spread it around.  Now Qwilleran lives in a small town, 400 miles north of everywhere, and writes for a small newspaper. He stands tall and straight. He dates a librarian. His roommates are two abandoned cats that he adopted along the way, one of them quite remarkable.  Despite his fame and fortune, Qwilleran's popularity really stems from his sense of humor, individuality, and willingness to listen. He has a writer's talent for sympathetic listening-half compassion, half curiosity-and it draws confidences from men and women, old and young.  Qwilleran has a secret of his own that he shares with no one--or hardly anyone. His male cat, Koko, has an uncanny intuition that can tell right from wrong and frequently sniffs out the evil-doer. Together, he and Qwilleran have solved several cases. The Cat Who Brought Down the House is the twenty-fifth installment of the Qwilleran saga. Shall we try for twenty-six?  Lilian",

Inlanders may be skeptical regarding the sometimes miraculous, often horror-filled tales that make up coastal folklore, but Outer Bankers accept the incredible as fact. But this book is more than a collection of coastal legends. It is an affectionate portrait of the people who daily pull a living out of the treacherous waters of the Atlantic . . . a tribute to the hardiness and courage that have made the Banker a rare breed . . . a breed whose true stories are, indeed, stranger than fiction.For decades, the folk tales of Charles Harry Whedbee have been available wherever you care to look on the Outer Banks. Their popularity has transcended Whedbee's loyal readership among North Carolinians and visitors from the Northeast and the Midwest. Charles Harry Whedbee was an elected judge in his native Greenville, North Carolina, for thirty-plus years, but his favorite place was the Outer Banks, Nags Head in particular. Whedbee was the author of five folklore collections. He died in 1990.",

        "Description": "Long before he was President or head of the CIA, before he fought terrorist attacks on the Super Bowl or the White House, even before a submarine named Red October made its perilous way across the Atlantic, Jack Ryan was an historian, teacher, and recent ex-Marine temporarily living in England while researching a book. A series of deadly encounters with an IRA splinter group had brought him to the attention of the CIA's Deputy Director, Vice Admiral James Greer\u2014as well as his counterpart with the British SIS, Sir Basil Charleston\u2014and when Greer asked him if he wanted to come aboard as a freelance analyst, Jack was quick to accept. The opportunity was irresistible, and he was sure he could fit it in with the rest of his work.\u00a0And then Jack forgot all about the rest of his work, because one of his first assignments was to help debrief a high-level Soviet defector, and the defector told an amazing tale: Top Soviet officials, including Yuri Andropov, were planning to assassinate the Pope, John Paul II.\u00a0Could it be true? As the days and weeks go by, Ryan must battle, first to try to confirm the plot, and then to prevent it, but this is a brave new world, and nothing he has done up to now has prepared him for the lethal game of cat-and-mouse that is the Soviet Union versus the United States. In the end, it will be not just the Pope's life but the stability of the Western world that is at stake. . . and it may already be too late for a novice CIA analyst to do anything about it.\"Clancy creates not only compelling characters but frighteningly topical situations and heart-stopping action,\" wrote The Washington Post about The Bear and the Dragon. \"Among the handful of superstars, Clancy still reigns, and he is not likely to be dethroned any time soon.\" These words were never truer than about the remarkable pages of his breathtaking new novel. This is Clancy at his best\u2014and there is none better.",

They were part of Company A of the 116th Regiment of the 29th Division, and the first wave of American soldiers to hit the beaches in Normandy. Later in the campaign, three more boys from this small Virginia town died of gunshot wounds. Twenty-two sons of Bedford lost--it is a story one cannot easily forget and one that the families of Bedford will never forget. The Bedford Boys is the true and intimate story of these men and the friends and families they left behind. Based on extensive interviews with survivors and relatives, as well as diaries and letters, Kershaw's book focuses on several remarkable individuals and families to tell one of the most poignant stories of World War II--the story of one small American town that went to war and died on Omaha Beach.",

        "Title": "Way Out There in the Blue: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War",
        "Authors": "By Fitzgerald, Frances",
        "Description": "Way Out There in the Blue is a major work of history by the Pulitzer Prize\u00adwinning author of Fire in the Lake. Using the Star Wars missile defense program as a magnifying glass on his presidency, Frances FitzGerald gives us a wholly original portrait of Ronald Reagan, the most puzzling president of the last half of the twentieth century.  Reagan's presidency and the man himself have always been difficult to fathom. His influence was enormous, and the few powerful ideas he espoused remain with us still -- yet he seemed nothing more than a charming, simple-minded, inattentive actor. FitzGerald shows us a Reagan far more complex than the man we thought we knew. A master of the American language and of self-presentation, the greatest storyteller ever to occupy the Oval Office, Reagan created a compelling public persona that bore little relationship to himself. The real Ronald Reagan -- the Reagan who emerges from FitzGerald's book -- was a gifted politician with a deep understanding of the American national psyche and at the same time an executive almost totally disengaged from the policies of his administration and from the people who surrounded him.  The idea that America should have an impregnable shield against nuclear weapons was Reagan's invention. His famous Star Wars speech, in which he promised us such a shield and called upon scientists to produce it, gave rise to the Strategic Defense Initiative. Reagan used his sure understanding of American mythology, history and politics to persuade the country that a perfect defense against Soviet nuclear weapons would be possible, even though the technology did not exist and was not remotely feasible. His idea turned into a multibillion-dollar research program. SDI played a central role in U.S.-Soviet relations at a crucial juncture in the Cold War, and in a different form it survives to this day.  Drawing on prodigious research, including interviews with the participants, FitzGerald offers new insights into American foreign policy in the Reagan era. She gives us revealing portraits of major players in Reagan's administration, including George Shultz, Caspar Weinberger, Donald Regan and Paul Nitze, and she provides a radically new view of what happened at the Reagan-Gorbachev summits in Geneva, Reykjavik, Washington and Moscow.  FitzGerald describes the fierce battles among Reagan's advisers and the frightening increase of Cold War tensions during Reagan's first term. She shows how the president who presided over the greatest peacetime military buildup came to espouse the elimination of nuclear weapons, and how the man who insisted that the Soviet Union was an \"evil empire\" came to embrace the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and to proclaim an end to the Cold War long before most in Washington understood that it had ended.  Way Out There in the Blue is a ground-breaking history of the American side of the end of the Cold War. Both appalling and funny, it is a black comedy in which Reagan, playing the",

        "Authors": "By Harris, Bill",
        "Description": "Towering over the skyline of the greatest city on earth, the World Trade Center stood as twin pillars of international commerce and prosperity. From investment bankers to portfolio traders, the leaders of the business world made deals that touched the lives of all the other nations and peoples of the world. The World Trade Center could never have been more than a dream without the vision and heroism of a brilliant corps of planners, engineers, and builders. They not only made buildings, but created an epicenter of growth and success for people all over the earth. Written by a leading expert on New York's history and landmarks, this book traces the efforts of mayors and other politicians over the years to pave the way for this supreme monument. The author deftly weaves together political, architectural, and financial history. With more than 120 magnificent color photos, The World Trade Center is a glorious tribute to the financial district and the Twin Towers. Although the buildings are no more, they will inspire future generations of Americans as the summit of architectural ambition and the zenith of human achievement. Bill Harris, the author of more than one hundred books, has an unparalleled knowledge of New York's history, architecture, and landmarks. A veteran journalist who worked for the New York Times for more than 20 years, he has written daily radio spots for that newspaper and New York Newsday, and has been an editor for leading news syndicates.",

Even now, summers and summers since, I can remember everything. I remember the day summer started.\"So begins Lee Smith's disarming first novel, written while she was an undergraduate at Hollins College and a winner in 1968 of the Book-of-the-Month Club Writing Fellowship Contest. The Last Day the Dogbushes Bloomed, set in a small southern town at midcentury, tells the story of nine-year-old Susan, for whom the first bright, carefree, promise-filled days of summer slowly evolve into a time of innocence lost and childhood illusions shattered. Susan's mother is vain and frivolous, her father loving but distracted, and her sister, several years her senior, is coping with the first stirrings of serious love. Susan's circle of young friends is joined for the summer by Eugene, the frail, strange nephew of a neighbor. As the months pass, Susan witnesses the disintegration of her parents' marriage and learns from Eugene the cruelty people sometimes resort to.Lyrical and fanciful in spite of its dark moments, The Last Day the Dogbushes Bloomed puts on ample display the remarkable talent that has made Lee Smith one of our most popular writers of fiction.",

        "Authors": "By Sklar, Kathryn Kish",
        "Description": "Although she is often remembered only as the sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher, there was a time in Catharine Beecher\u2019s life when she was more widely known than any member of her eminent family. A pioneering teacher, a writer on moral and religious topics, and an avid publicist for women\u2019s education, her name became a household word in the 1840s because of the enormous success of her Treatise on Domestic Economy. This comprehensive guide to all aspects of domestic self-management was part of her effort to create a female domain from which cultural power could be exercised. In the recent reassessment of the historical experience of women, the middle decades of the last century have emerged as a critical period: the movement for women\u2019s rights was born, and the genteel cult of the lady and the encumbering customs of domesticity took hold. Present-day attitudes about the family and images of masculine and feminine roles are still strongly shaped by nineteenth-century ideas. Catherine Beecher: A Study in American Domesticity examines that era through the life of one of its major protagonists. It offers new insights into the shifting contours of the nineteenth-century female experience and is a signal contribution to the intellectual and social history of the period.",

Besides the fact that she's a bit ambivalent about motherhood in the first place, she's already plenty busy restoring old houses, and life on the Oregon farm she and her husband, Gil, run is happy, hectic, and full.Then they're hit with the verdict - infertility - and soon it's clear that nothing will ever be the same again.Betsy is shocked to find herself one of those women whose heart aches at the sight of a stroller or the news of a friend's pregnancy, and her days deteriorate into one long roller-coaster ride of exhilaration and despair as she and Gil negotiate the endless round of lab tests, temperature charts, and sex on schedule that comprise their therapy.Ordinary miracles is a warm, funny exploration of the blind craving for children experienced by so many of us, the passionate drive to reproduce that seems to defy all rational analysis. Beyond that, Linda Crew celebrates the delights and challenges of an old-fashioned yet up-to-date marriage with sensitivity, grace, and not a little humor.For anyone who has ever longed for a child, Ordinary Miracles is a compassionate, joyful novel, sure to evoke both tears and smiles.",

        "Description": "Through the centuries and across the world, the Virgin Mary has appeared to ordinary people of every race and culture, from scholars to illiterates, from the devout to the unbelieving, from young children to the dying. In this exquisite and inspiring volume, Janice T. Connell chronicles authenticated Marian apparitions and messages Mary has brought from God--as mother, comforter, Queen of Angels, and Prophet of the Apocalypse.Drawn from scripture, legend, and never-before-published eyewitness accounts, these are personal stories--the author's own, and her interviews with other visionaries--filled with beauty, wonder, and joy. Meetings with Mary ranges from Elijah's vision of Mary eight hundred years before her birth to the world-famous children of Medjugorje in Bosnia, whose encounters with her began in 1981 and continue daily. Here also are lesser-known, deeply touching encounters with the Mother, from an office worker in Holland to a Japanese nun, from a Jewish banker in Rome to an awestruck crowd of visionaries, few of them Christians or of any other faith, in Egypt.Meetings with Mary asks also: as the millennium draws near, shadowed by disasters, disease, and brutal civil warfare, are Mary's frequent appearances a signal to the faithful? Perhaps she is calling us all to join her now on a voyage toward the eternal shores of peace, joy, and abiding love. . . . \"[Connell is] passionate about prayer and sharing her love of Jesus'mother. . . . She has a way of simplifying complex theology.\"--Rocky Mountain News",

        "Title": "Gag Rule: On the Suppression of Dissent and Stifling of Democracy",
        "Authors": "By Lapham, Lewis H.",
        "Description": "From one of America's most important voices of protest, an urgent new polemic about the stifling of the American public's capacity for meaningful dissent, the lifeblood of our democracy, at the hands of a government and media increasingly beholden only to the country's wealthy few.  Dissent is democracy. Democracy is in trouble. Never before, argues Lewis Lapham, have voices of protest been so locked out of the mainstream political conversation: they are criminalized, marginalized, and muted by a government that recklessly disregards civil liberties and by an ever-more concentrated and profit-driven media, in which the safe and the selling sweep all uncomfortable truths from view. As a result, we face a crisis of democracy as serious as any in our history. Never has the public conversation been more in need of dissent, and never has protest been more effectively quarantined into zones where it has so little effect on the political process. Under the noses of a cowed and silenced populace, Lapham posits, the Bush regime is \"assembling from the ruins of a democratic republic the corporate splendor of a precision-guided empire....What the Bush administration has in mind is not the defense of the American citizenry against a foreign enemy, but the protection of the American oligarchy from the American democracy.\"  Dissent has always had a hard time of it, Lapham shows in a bravura short tour of political dissent in American history, and an especially hard one in time of war. The more ill defined the conflict and the more invisible the enemy, the worse it is for civil liberties, particularly the liberty to disagree. And now, just when the electorate is most narcotized and apathetic, spoon-fed its infotainment by a small gang of gigantic media conglomerates, and the government is in the hands of a terrifyingly self-righteous crew, comes a conflict, the \"war on terror,\" that makes the hunt for Communists in the 1950s look like the Normandy landings on D-Day in its clarity of aim and purpose. It's a witch's brew that is pure poison for a living democracy.  Gag Rule is a rousing and necessary call to action in defense of one of our most important liberties-the right to raise our voices against the powers that be and have those voices heard.",

On his way to steal The Book from the House at the End of the World, Althalus is confronted by a cat - a cat with eyes like emeralds, the voice of a woman, and the powers of a goddess.She is Dweia, sister to The Gods and a greater thief even than Althalus. She must be: For in no time at all, she has stolen his heart. And more. She has stolen time itself. For when Althalus leaves the House at the End of the World, much wiser but not a day older than when he'd first entered it, thousands of years have gone by.But Dweia is not the only one able to manipulate time. Her evil brother shares the power, and while Dweia has been teaching Althalus the secrets of The Book, the ancient God has been using the dark magic of his own Book to rewrite history. Yet all is not lost. But only if Althalus, still a thief at heart, can bring together a ragtag group of men, women and children with no reason to trust him or each other.",

        "Title": "Making The Most of Your Money",
        "Authors": "By Quinn, Jane Bryant",
        "Description": "This classic book of solid and practical financial advice has been completely refocused to address new tax laws, new ways of paying for higher education, new forms of health insurance, and the completely new investment climate.As a financial planning tool, the original Making the Most of Your Money predicted a change in America's priorities?away from an obsession with spending and toward a desire to save and invest. The book also foresaw an environment dominated by falling inflation and interest rates. That call was right on the money.The new edition sees yet another shift in financial energies -- a fresh round of serious borrowing, as the boomers start sending kids to college; a desire to save for retirement fast; and an obsession with keeping safe the profits that have already been made. Investing is getting more complex, as more financial products and services come to market and as traditional guideposts change. More than ever, investors need a clear path through the undergrowth.The new Making the Most of Your Money is that path. It presents a new blueprint for twenty-first-century success.On investing: The markets will surprise you. Serious investors need a better understanding of asset allocation and how to diversify for global gains while minimizing risk. The new edition presents a variety of investment mixes for different purposes. You'll also find a sophisticated guide to picking superior mutual funds.On paying for college: The entire federal financial-aid program has been overhauled. Much more money is available to middle-class families, making paying for college the art of the possible. This book takes you through all the money sources.On buying a home: The percentage of Americans owning their own homes is on an upswing. That's because mortgage lenders are rapidly opening their doors to people who couldn't get loans before. They also have the welcome mat out for young first-time buyers. You'll find out here how all these new programs work.On life and health insurance: Life insurance and tax-deferred annuities are being widely sold as retirement investments. The new edition helps you decide when that's a good idea and when it isn't (hint: it usually isn't). In a greatly expanded section on HMOs, Quinn explains how to evaluate the choices you have and lays out your rights if your insurer lets you down.On retirement planning: Employees have built up significant assets in 401(k)s and other tax-deferred plans. The self-employed have several deductible options to choose from -- each one just right for a particular situation. An expanded retirement section helps you get the most from any retirement savings plan and forecasts how much you're likely to need in your old age.On post retirement planning: Given longer life spans, people who think they've retired haven't. A section for those past retirement lays out better investment strategies for making money last.On the checklists for changes in your life: The checklist chapter?one of the sections of the original edition that was consulted most often?has been expanded to include checklists for starting a home based business, teaching kids about money, unmarried couples, new widows and widowers, and defensive planning for a potential layoff. Quinn has also added to the existing checklists on pre- and post-marital planning, caring for an elderly parent, having a baby, finding day care, and enduring divorce.On finding a financial adviser: Almost every financial salesperson today claims to be a financial planner?so you'll learn more about how to separate the mutts from the purebreds. But with what you learn here you can be your own financial adviser. No one will ever care as much about your money as you do.     The completely revised and updated Making the Most of Your Money will carry Americans through the millennium-pointing younger workers toward saving the rising incomes they're going to earn, boomers toward the retirement that can be more successful than they think, and retirees toward an investment plan they can be comfortable with. With this edition, you'll be making the most of your money ever.",

One hundred fifty years later, Clare Boylan has finished Bront\u00eb\u2019s novel, sparking a sensational literary event. With pitch-perfect tone that is utterly true to Bront\u00eb\u2019s voice, Boylan delivers a brilliant tale about a mysterious young girl, Matilda, who is delivered to a girls\u2019 school in provincial England. When everything about the girl\u2019s wealthy background turns out to be a fiction, it falls to a local gentleman, Mr. Ellin, and a childless widow, Isabel Chalfont, to begin a quest for her past and her identity that takes them from the drawing rooms of country society to London\u2019s seamiest alleys. With all the intelligence and pathos of the novel\u2019s originator, Boylan develops Bront\u00eb\u2019s sketch of a girl without a past into a stunning portrait of Victorian society with a shameful secret at its heart.",
