'This book is for those who need a fresh take on Jesus and what it means for us to live the kind of life he teaches us to live,' writes Rob Bell. 'This pursuit of Jesus is leading us backward as much as forward ... I am learning that what seems brand new is often just the discovery of something that has been there all along--- it just got lost somewhere and it needs to be picked up, dusted off, and reclaimed.' Now in softcover, Velvet Elvis offers original and refreshingly personal perspectives on what Christianity is really about. 'We have to test everything,' writes Bell. 'Do that to this book. Don't swallow it uncritically. Think about it. Wrestle with it. Just because I'm a Christian and I'm trying to articulate a Christian worldview doesn't mean I've got it nailed. I'm contributing to the discussion. God has spoken, and the rest is commentary, right?'",

Most are also concerned with the structure of narrative, including the present novel, in which Woolf conveys the impression of time present and of time passing in individual experience as well as in the characters' awareness of historic time.Considered Woolf's first original and distinguished work, Jacob's Room (1922) concerns a sensitive young man, Jacob Flanders, who finds himself unable to reconcile his love of classical culture with the chaotic reality of World War I. His story unfolds in a series of brief impressions and conversations, stream-of-consciousness narratives, internal monologues, and letters.This inexpensive edition of Woolf's intense and affecting novel offers readers a first-rate example of subtle style and innovative techniques for which the author is admired.",

Here is the story of the war as it affected soldiers and civilians, leaders and common folk alike - real people who bravely endured the times. While one can never learn or tell all their stories, one can honor their memories by recounting their amazing, inspiring, poignant, ironic, and yes, even pitiful stories in this war to end all wars.   Included are such stories as:    Professor William Miller, who collapsed during a 75-mile \"death march\" in Germany and was saved b the same man who had rescued him from a car wreck in Pennsylvania five years earlier.  Karl Fuchs, a German tank gunner who wrote tender letters to his wife as his Panzer division invaded Russia. Jim Kilroy, worker at a shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, whose say of signing off on his inspections became the morale-boosting slogan for countless GI's: \"Kilroy was here.\" Kasuo Sakamaki, pilot of a midget submarine who was captured after a failed attempt to infiltrate Pearl Harbor. \"Kitty,\" the diary of a Jewish teenager in Amsterdam rescued after the war by her father and published in thirty-two languages as Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl.  These and many more stories and anecdotes fill the pages of this fascinating book that will make World War II come alive with the thoughts and feelings of those who were there.",

Now, with Evening, she gives us her most ambitious novel, a work of surpassing beauty. During a summer weekend on the coast of Maine, at the wedding of her best friend, Ann Grant fell in love. She was twenty-five. Forty years later--after three marriages and five children--Ann Lord finds herself in the dim claustrophobia of illness, careening between lucidity and delirium and only vaguely conscious of the friends and family parading by her bedside, when the memory of that weekend returns to her with the clarity and intensity of a fever-dream. Evening unfolds in the rushlight of that memory, as Ann relives those three vivid days on the New England coast, with motorboats buzzing and bands playing in the night, and the devastating tragedy that followed a spectacular wedding. Here, in the surge of hope and possibility that coursed through her at twenty-five--in a singular time of complete surrender--Ann discovers the highest point of her life. Superbly written and miraculously uplifting, Evening is a stirring exploration of time and memory, of love's transcendence and of its failure to transcend--a rich testament to the depths of grief and passion, and a stunning achievement.",

The instruction includes the most up-to-date and scientific data regarding food protein.  By using the egg as a model of the near perfect protein source and comparing vegetarian foods with the egg, we now have available tools for increasing the benefits of protein from non-meat sources.\"Patients with certain medical problems should consider removing red meat and other animal proteins from their diet and moving toward vegetarian food sources.  Some of these medical problems include the following: hypoglycemia, obesity, digestive disorders including diverticultitis and other colon problems, gout, and elevated cholestrol.  Many specfic studies have shown that the vegetarian diet may help with these problems.  This book presents a clear and sophisticated road map for becoming a vegetarian or moving in this direction.\" --Dr Martin Feldman",

Goldy is determined that everything will go right - which is why, she figures later, everything went terribly wrong.It all started before dawn on the day of the first Anglophile lunch, when Goldy had just about the rudest awakening possible: a shotgun blast through her living room window. With her home now a crime scene and her cop husband Tom out of town searching for a fugitive hijacker, Goldy has no choice but to show up for work at the castle - six hours early. And it doesn't take her long to realize that her early-morning wake-up call was only the beginning.While out checking on the tables for the luncheon, Goldy spots something strange lying in Cottonwood Creek. Upon closer inspection, she can see that it is a body, clad in flannel and shot through the head. Goldy quickly dials 911, but before the police arrive, shots ring out for the second time that day - and this time, someone Goldy loves is right in the line of fire.",

        "Authors": "By Gingrich, Newt, Forstchen, William R., and Hanser, Albert S.",
        "Description": "The Civil War is the American Iliad. Lincoln, Stonewall Jackson, Grant, and Lee still stand as heroic ideals, as stirring to our national memory as were the legendary Achilles and Hector to the world of the ancient Greeks. Within the story of our Iliad one battle stands forth above all others: Gettysburg.Millions visit Gettysburg each year to walk the fields and hills where Joshua Chamberlain made his legendary stand and Pickett went down to a defeat which doomed a nation, but in defeat forever became a symbol of the heroic Lost Cause. As the years passed, and the scars healed, the debate, rather than drifting away has intensified. It is the battle which has become the great \"what if,\" of American history and the center of a dreamscape where Confederate banners finally do crown the heights above the town. The year is 1863, and General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia are poised to attack the North and claim the victory that would end the brutal conflict. But Lee's Gettysburg campaign ended in failure, ultimately deciding the outcome of the war. Launching his men into a vast sweeping operation, of which the town of Gettysburg is but one small part of the plan, General Lee, acting as he did at Chancellorsville, Second Manassas, and Antietam, displays the audacity of old. He knows he has but one more good chance to gain ultimate victory, for after two years of war the relentless power of an industrialized north is wearing the South down. Lee's lieutenants and the men in the ranks, imbued with this renewed spirit of the offensive embark on the Gettysburg Campaign that many dream \"should have been.\" The soldiers in the line, Yank and Reb, knew as well that this would be the great challenge, the decisive moment that would decided whether a nation would die, or be created, and both sides were ready, willing to lay down their lives for their Cause.An action-packed and painstakingly researched masterwork by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen, Gettysburg stands as the first book in a series to tell the story of how history could have unfolded, how a victory for Lee would have changed the destiny of the nation forever. This is a novel of true heroism and glory in America's most trying hour.",

The authors provide a much-needed bridge between traditional spelling instruction and whole language approaches, showing teachers (and parents, too) how spelling ability begins to emerge in young children's invented spellings, how it grows as children pass through predictable stages of spelling strategies, and how eventually every student can reach a standard of correct \"expert\" spelling.  The text includes wordlists, tips for teaching predictable patterns, and a variety of individual activities that prepare children to meet the phonetic, semantic, historical, and visual demands of spelling, plus strategies for implementing a spelling workshop in the elementary classroom.  Teachers, school administrators, and parents who want to understand the complex process of spelling will find this book a valuable resource.",

        "Authors": "By Zimmerman, Marcia",
        "Description": "The first scientifically proven, effective, all-natural nutritional alternative to the much-prescribed drug Ritalin Attention Deficit Disorder is a nutritional deficiency, not a psychological condition. This is the revolutionary discovery Marcia Zimmerman made during her ten years of research as a nutritional biochemist. That conclusion led her to develop a diet that addresses the specific needs of the 17 million adults and children suffering from ADD. Her easy-to-follow thirty-day plan has been proven just as effective as Ritalin in relieving the symptoms of ADD. Learn: - How women should boost their nutrition before conception to prevent ADD in their children.- Why boys are much likelier to be tagged as ADD than girls- How to get a reliable ADD diagnosis - The effects of brain allergies on attention span- Foods to avoid that may exacerbate ADD- The dangers of artificial food ingredients- and much moreThis important book will help us curb the epidemic growth of ADD in this country and change the way we treat those who have it now by addressing its source instead of merely treating its symptoms.\"This book is must reading for every parent, physician, teacher and school nurse who deals with ADD and AD/HD children. ADD is not caused by a deficiency of Ritalin. Marcia Zimmerman's The A.D.D. Nutrition Solutionis right on target!\" -- Bernard Rimland, Ph.D., director of the Autism Research Institute, San Diego",
