In five nerve-wracking events--including a search and destroy mission and vicious dogfights over the scorching sands of the Great Arabian Desert--each of these veteran topguns will use their expertise and guts to win billions of dollars in exclusive government contracts. Award-winning reporter Jack Warner is there covering the events, but now he's on the inside, directing the media coverage. From the moment the pilots and VIP guests arrive at the Saudi royal family's fabulously luxurious, remote desert compound, the competition takes a sinister twist. First an American fighter pilot--the renowned Randi Coles, who shattered stereotypes with her legendary MiG kill over Lybia--is suddenly grounded. Then this friendly \"war\" turns lethal--two pilots are killed in action. Searching for answers, Jack and Randi soon discover the competition is as dangerous on the ground as it is in the air. Caught in a labyrinth of conspiracy and intrigue, they must fight for their lives and uncover a serpentine plot with as many twists as an airshow maneuver--all under the watchful eyes of the most powerful people in the world.",

In three years, she\u2019s taken on some of Lake Tahoe\u2019s most controversial cases and has turned her struggling one-woman law firm into a thriving practice. Now she\u2019s ready to sort out her complex relationship with her boyfriend, Monterey P.I. Paul van Wagoner. So she\u2019s heading to the Carmel Valley, the place where she began her career and where her estranged father lives. It\u2019s also a place of dramatic contradictions and hidden tensions, of new wealth and old families.  And, within days of her arrival, Nina is already feeling the heat, as a case of arson exposes some of the darkest secrets of  her hometown. Two suspicious fires have already raged through the valley this summer, igniting suspicions of arson. When a third blaze ends in a fatality, police zero in on a suspect: Wish, the son of Sandy Whitefeather, Nina\u2019s ex-assistant. The dead man is identified as Wish\u2019s childhood friend, a troubled local auto mechanic who hated the changes wealthy newcomers had brought to the valley. Nina and Paul are certain that there is more to this strange case than meets the eye. As they work together to clear Wish, new, more frightening questions are raised, and another fire is set. And out of the flames a terrifying picture emerges: a community steeped in secrets and rage, a tangled history between two men, and a killer whose motives are dark and wrenching. With the relentless page-turning suspense that has become her trademark, Perri O\u2019Shaughnessy once again demonstrates her talent to enthrall. A haunting tale of crime and punishment, old grudges and second chances, Presumption of Death is suspense fiction at its finest--instantly compelling and utterly impossible to put down.",

All the latest studies prove that strength training, not aerobics, provides the key to losing fat and building a fit, strong body. This book refutes the misconception that women will \"bulk up\" if they lift heavy weights. Nonsense! It's tough enough for men to pack on muscle, and they have much more of the hormone necessary to build muscle: natural testosterone. Muscles need to be strengthened to achieve a lean, healthy look. Properly conditioned muscles increase metabolism and promote weight loss -- it's that simple. The program demands that women put down the \"Barbie\" weights, step away from the treadmill and begin a strength and conditioning regime for the natural athlete in every woman. The New Rules of Lifting for Women will change the way women see fitness, nutrition and their own bodies.",

But someone else has different ideas for keeping her busy, which seem to include slashing tires, cracking windshields, and covering the walls of her cottage with red paint. Kelly's scared, but she's hoping it's just random vandalism.All that changes when House of Lambspun, the local knitting shop, is trashed and a young woman is found dead in the basement.

But like the most delicate cross-stitch, their lives are held together by the most tenuous threads of happiness...and they can unravel.   As each woman confronts a personal crisis, a painful truth, or a life-changing choice, the quilt serves as a symbol of the complex and enduring bonds between mothers and daughters, sisters and friends. In weaving together the harmonious, disparate pieces of their crazy-quilt lives, the Elm Creek Quilters come to realize that friendship is one of the most precious gifts we can give each other, and that love can strengthen understanding, lead to new beginnings, and illuminate our lives.",

After a perilous escape, Sofia endures months of desolation and hardship. But, clinging to a promise she made to Anna, she subsists on the belief that someday she will track down Vasily. In a remote village, she's nursed back to health by a Gypsy family, and there she finds more than refuge--she also finds Mikhail Pashin, who, her heart tells her, is Vasily in disguise. He's everything she has ever wanted--but he belongs to Anna. After coming this far, Sofia is tantalizingly close to freedom, family--even a future. All that stands in her way is the secret past that could endanger everything she has come to hold dear!",

In A Portrait of Jesus, bestselling writer Joseph Girzone recaptures the truth of Jesus that is presented in the Gospels and gives a compelling vision of the person Jesus' contemporaries must have known. In his most powerful work yet, Girzone seeks to personify Christ in the minds of readers by asking some simple questions: \"What did people see in Jesus as he walked down the street? How did he approach others and what would these people take away from meeting him? What do his actions tell us about how we can live our lives today?\" It is Girzone's empowering and loving understanding of the heart of Christianity that will make A Portrait of Jesus a groundbreaking classic in the tradition of his bestselling books, Joshua and Never Alone.From the Hardcover edition.",

Of all the urban landscapes in America, perhaps none has so thoroughly infused and nurtured modern literature as Brooklyn. Though its literary history runs deep-Walt Whitman, Truman Capote, and Norman Mailer are just a few of its storied inhabitants-in recent years the borough has seen a growing concentration of bestselling novelists, memoirists, poets, and journalists. It has become what Greenwich Village once was for an earlier generation: a wellspring of inspiration and artistic expression. Brooklyn Was Mine gives some of today's best writers an opportunity to pay tribute to the borough they love in 20 original essays that draw on past and present to create a mosaic that brilliantly captures the quality and diversity of a unique, literary landscape. Contributors include: Emily Barton, Susan Choi, Rachel Cline, Philip Dray, Jennifer Egan, Colin Harrison, Joanna Hershon, Jonathan Lethem, Dinaw Mengestu, Elizabeth Gaffney, Lara Vapnyar, Lawrence Osborne, Katie Roiphe, John Burnham Schwartz, Vijay Seshadri, Darcey Steinke, Darin Strauss, Alexandra Styron, Robert Sullivan  With an introduction by Phillip Lopate.",

        "Title": "Lessons in Becoming Myself",
        "Authors": "By Burstyn, Ellen",
        "Description": "Ellen Burstyn has always defied expectations. Born in Detroit during the Depression, she left home at eighteen and became a model for J. L. Hudson, Detroit's largest department store. After a failed marriage and a string of unsatisfying relationships and jobs that took her from Detroit to Dallas to Montreal, Burstyn settled in New York, where she began her career as an actress. Her first audition landed her the lead in a Broadway play, with the show's producer, the legendary playwright and director Moss Hart, telling her, \"You're a natural.\"When Burstyn reluctantly moved to Los Angeles with her second husband, she eventually turned to film, delivering over the course of her career brilliant performances in The Last Picture Show; The Exorcist; Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress); Same Time, Next Tear; Resurrection, and Requiem for a Dream.Lessons in Becoming Myself is the culmination of these lessons. It's the story of Burstyn's life as an actor, of her early work in such films as the critically acclaimed Last Picture Show, and of how her portrayal of Chris MacNeil in The Exorcist - a movie still considered by many the scariest ever made - led her to star in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, one of the first movies to explore the plight of a single mother struggling to find her own way in the world.Yet this book is also an account of Burstyn's search for personal and professional authenticity and the consequences of that search. She describes the personal missteps, toxic relationships, and private demons she has battled, and how confronting them prompted her to find a different life path. Raised a Catholic (for a time she even attended a Catholic boarding school), Burstyn has traveled the world exploring a wide range of spiritual experiences that defy labels and go deep to the heart of who she is. From the Swiss Alps to Cambodia, from the Himalayas to the streets of New York, Burstyn has sought - and found - answers to life's most puzzling questions.",

She skips from town to town in an Airstream trailer, working odd jobs and keeping to herself until a sudden whim lets her know it's time to move again.  And this works just fine, until the day two unexpected visitors show up at the New Jersey trailer park she calls home. One is a childhood friend with news: her mother and his father are getting married, and they want EJ to be there. The other is a sweet but odd woman named Jess, who says she's an angel specializing in cosmic relationship mending...and blueberry pancakes.
