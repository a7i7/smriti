        "Title": "Food Matters: A Guide to Conscious Eating with More Than 75 Recipes",
        "Authors": "By Bittman, Mark",
        "Description": "From the award-winning champion of culinary simplicity who gave us the bestselling How to Cook Everything and How to Cook Everything Vegetarian comes Food Matters, a plan for responsible eating that's as good for the planet as it is for your weight and your health.We are finally starting to acknowledge the threat carbon emissions pose to our ozone layer, but few people have focused on the extent to which our consumption of meat contributes to global warming. Think about it this way: In terms of energy consumption, serving a typical family-of-four steak dinner is the rough equivalent of driving around in an SUV for three hours while leaving all the lights on at home.Bittman offers a no-nonsense rundown on how government policy, big business marketing, and global economics influence what we choose to put on the table each evening. He demystifies buzzwords like \"organic,\" \"sustainable,\" and \"local\" and offers straightforward, budget-conscious advice that will help you make small changes that will shrink your carbon footprint -- and your waistline.Flexible, simple, and non-doctrinaire, the plan is based on hard science but gives you plenty of leeway to tailor your food choices to your lifestyle, schedule, and level of commitment. Bittman, a food writer who loves to eat and eats out frequently, lost thirty-five pounds and saw marked improvement in his blood levels by simply cutting meat and processed foods out of two of his three daily meals. But the simple truth, as he points out, is that as long as you eat more vegetables and whole grains, the result will be better health for you and for the world in which we live.Unlike most things that are virtuous and healthful, Bittman's plan doesn't involve sacrifice. From Spinach and Sweet Potato Salad with Warm Bacon Dressing to Breakfast Bread Pudding, the recipes in Food Matters are flavorful and sophisticated. A month's worth of meal plans shows you how Bittman chooses to eat and offers proof of how satisfying a mindful and responsible diet can be. Cheaper, healthier, and socially sound, Food Matters represents the future of American eating.",

That worried me; if I had to shoot this thing, I didn't need it flailing around in my hand like the snake it was named for.\"Tough spot. And you love it. You're a sleuth in your soul and a writer at heart. You can't resist the lure of the lurid, the thrill of the chase, the artful turn of a word, and the battle of wits in solving crimes of the imaginary kind.Still, as you know, mystery fiction is a species all its own, and writing it can be a special type of puzzle.But this is a special book, a writer's conference of sorts. In this book, your partners in literary criminology are among today's top mystery authors. Through informal essays, they'll show you how the pieces fit.More than a score of writers are represented here: Warren Murphy and Molly Cochran reveal the perils and pleasures of collaboration; Sara Paretsky - creator of the V.I. Warshawski series - comments on the promise and problems of inventing a recurring character; Tony Hillerman argues against plot outlines; John Lutz writes of endings and suggests knowing where you're going before you set out.With this book, you'll learn how to make your stories more taut, more real, more immediate, and more fraught with tension.\"I heard the triple-click of a revolver's hammer being thumbed back. I fired. And a split-second of muzzle-flash illuminated what had first bothered me about the neon sign buzzing in the midnight fog.\"The solutions are up to you. But now you're armed with all the clues you need to solve the mystery ... of how to write a mystery.",

        "Description": "The long-awaited second novel by Paul Witcover, acclaimed author of the remarkable Waking Beauty, is a stunning and provocative masterwork ofingenious imagination -- part-coming-of-age story, part contemporary fairy tale, part technological nightmare, and a brilliant dark vision of dystopia. Twelve-year-old twins Jack and Jilly Doone are closer than most siblings -- uncannily linked, sharing thoughts, sensations, and emotions as if one person -- as they enjoy a mostly parentless August at the Delaware shore. But in the fury of an onrushing hurricane, a frighteningly close brush with death awakens an awesome power in Jack that changes everything ...On an alternate Earth -- transformed centuries earlier by the Viral Wars into a savage battleground where the \"normal\" followers of the emperor Pluribus Unum clash unceasingly with warriors of five mutated elemental races -- a young aerie named Kestrel sets out into the perilous Waste with four companions, trusting their fates to the great and powerful Odds. Taking the next all-important step in every \"mute's\" odyssey to adulthood and duty, Kestrel dreams of glory and sacrifice, and of single-handedly bringing about the total extermination of the hated \"norm\" enemy. But even his ability to soar high above his world will not help him escape the treachery of those he dares not trust, and his psionic powers over the winds cannot blow away the strange and shattering destiny that awaits him at journey's end.A different yet oddly synchronistic fate looms for Jack Doone in this endgame summer of frightening discovery and forbidden experimentation. Suddenly cursed with the uncontrollable power to alter reality -- to \"do over\" events and change the flow of his life and the lives of those around him -- his day-to-day existence has become a twisted version of the \"Mutes and Norms\" role-playing game devised and orchestrated by his uncle Jimmy. And now the twins' survival may come down to a single roll of the cosmic dice, as Jack finds himself devastatingly alone for the first time, his cherished Jilly's protector in a terrifying battle to determine the real, armed with no weapon but memory.A staggeringly original work that blurs the lines between reality and the fantastic, between the accepted and the taboo, between fantasy and science fiction, Paul Witcover's Tumbling After is proof positive that intelligence and invention still reign supreme in the thrilling literature of speculation.",

        "Description": "At first glance, plants appear to be extremely passive organisms, silent, immobile, and unprotected. But within their placid exteriors there occurs a continuous swirl of activity - a complex orchestration of processes that allow the plant to obtain food, endure drastic weather, fend off predators, anticipate the future, and carry out tasks more often associated with higher animals. Plants are organic chemists par excellence, capable of synthesizing complex molecules; and they are experts at survival, equipped to withstand and adapt to the many challenges of nature.In Life Processes of Plants, botanist Arthur Galston describes how plants live, react to crises, and change when necessary. It is an eloquent and exquisitely illustrated volume, vividly conveying the scientific research that brought these extraordinary natural skills to light.Galston explores the dynamic existence of plants at all levels - from the organism as a whole down to the interplay of its tissues, cells, and molecules. Readers will be intrigued by the plant's methods of storing energy from sunlight, by the internal clock that tells plants the time of day, by the chemical warfare used against predators and competitors, and by the hormonal and electro-chemical communications network that conveys information within the plant. In addition, readers will witness the plant's impressive powers of regeneration, wherein almost any single cell can be the starting point for a complete separate plant. Another chapter shows how this regenerative ability and cooperation with microbes are the keys to remarkable developments in the exciting field of agricultural biotechnology.Life Processes of Plants illuminates some often overlooked phenomena of the natural world. Readers will see plants in a whole new way - as fascinating examples of both the complexity and simplicity of life.",

The year is 1989.Revolutions are sweeping through the nations of the Eastern Bloc. Communism is unraveling. And nobody feels this unraveling more piquantly than Yuri Balodis\u2014a fifteen-year-old first-generation American living with his Latvian-immigrant parents in Milwaukee\u2019s Third Ward.It\u2019s a turbulent time. And when Yuri falls in love with Hannah Graham\u2014the daring daughter of a prominent local socialist\u2014chaos ensues. Within weeks, Yuri is ensnared by both Hannah and socialism. He joins the staff of the Socialist Worker. He starts quoting Lenin and Marx indiscriminately.His parents, of course, are horrified and deeply saddened. They try to educate him, to show him why, in their opinion, communism has ruined so many lives. But Yuri is stubborn. And his ideological betrayal will have more serious consequences than breaking his parents\u2019 hearts.Red Weather is by turns funny and bittersweet, tinged with a rueful comic sense that will instantly remind you of the absurd complications of love. Pauls Toutonghi\u2019s stunning debut novel is at once reminiscent of Michael Chabon\u2019s The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and Khaled Hosseini\u2019s The Kite Runner.",

        "Title": "A History of Israel: Volume II: From the Aftermath of the Yom Kippur War",
        "Authors": "By Sachar, Howard Morley",
        "Description": "A sequel to Howard Sachar's classic History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time, which Commentary called \"monumental...a triumph of comprehensive scholarship which is also a delight to read,\" this book offers an equally compelling and powerful narrative and a wealth of human detail.  The second volume begins where its predecessor left off, tracing the political, social, and economic growth of the Israeli republic from the traumatic aftermath of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 through the Begin and Peres eras.      With lucidity and incisiveness, Sachar presents the fascinating saga of the ethnic \"revolution\" that brought Menachem Begin to power; the social upheavals that have shaken the Arab population of the West Bank; the growth of Palestinian terrorism and of incipient Jewish vigilantism; and the clandestine dialogue between Israel's and Lebanon's political leaders that culminated in Ariel Sharon's ill-starred 1982 military invasion.      Since the Yom Kippur War, Israel's history has consisted of stark contrasts between dramatic military strikes abroad--Entebbe, Baghdad, Tunis among them--and confusion and violent confrontation at home over such issues as the settlement of the occupied Arab territories and religious extremism.  Covering all the dramatic milestones since the mid-seventies, Sachar explores Israel's current malaise and the extent to which the fate of the Jewish nation rests on the foreign and economic strategies of the Great Powers.      Both a compelling story and a penetrating analysis of Israel's current difficulties and achievements, this volume stands as a brilliant successor to a book critics and scholars have recognized as the definitive work in the field.",

And now I'm honored that she's agreed to serve in my Cabinet.\"\u2014George W. Bush, in his official statement nominating Condoleezza Rice as the next Secretary of StateAs Secretary of State and a close confidant of President George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice is the most influential woman in the history of the United States government, and perhaps one of the most famous black women in the world. Her latest stint in Washington, DC follows her role as National Security Advisor to the President and a distinguished career as scholar, professor, provost, and foreign policy advisor that has taken her from Birmingham, Alabama, to Denver, Colorado, to Palo Alto, California, to the White House\u2014all by the age of 50.But just who is this powerful woman who has experienced firsthand some of our nation's darkest and brightest moments, who was a key player in the government's response to the September 11 tragedies, and who some believe will likely be a future governor, senator, vice president, or even president? Drawing from exclusive interviews with dozens of relatives, colleagues, friends, and teachers and from scores of previously published interviews and articles, Antonia Felix gives us the first biography of this extraordinary American\u2014a poised, immensely appealing, fiercely loyal, and deeply religious woman, whose passions include music, football, and Russia.Her remarkable story is founded on a compelling family legacy. With ancestors on both sides who were white slave owners and slaves, Condoleezza Rice comes from two lineages, the Rices and the Rays, devoted to education and achievement. She was born in segregated Birmingham in 1954 and grew up in the upwardly mobile, high-achieving, black middle-class enclave of the city. Her music-loving parents, both educators, named her after a musical term, Condolcezza\u2014to play \"with sweetness.\"The Rices started their only child on piano lessons at age three and filled her childhood years with ballet, figure skating, tutoring in French and Spanish, football viewing, and a constant flow of books at her bedside table, setting forth a standard of excellence that would give her the \"twice as good\" edge necessary to be on an even standing with her white peers in the segregated South.While in training to become a concert pianist (a dream she eventually cast aside), Rice graduated from high school at 16 and from the University of Denver at 19. She ultimately found her career calling from her professor there, Josef Korbel, former Central European diplomat and father of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who sparked her passion for Soviet studies. After receiving a Ph.D. at age 26, Rice became an assistant professor of political science at Stanford, starting on the path that led to her becoming the youngest-ever provost at Stanford, the youngest and first-ever female national security advisor, and the first black, female secretary of state.The story of her path to excellence is an inspiration to all, regardless of politics. Ms. Felix's book, Condi, not only gives us the first comprehensive portrait of the person who has the president's ear perhaps more than anyone else in his administration\u2014a black woman who has risen to the top in a field traditionally dominated by white men\u2014but also a greater understanding of and insight into the workings of the White House.",

Kirpal, called Kip, is shy and not yet twenty when he arrives for the first time at General Kumar's camp, nestled in the shadow of the Siachen Glacier. At twenty thousand feet, the glacier makes a forbidding battlefield; its crevasses claimed the body of Kip's father. Kip becomes an apprentice under the camp's chef, Kishen, a fiery mentor who guides him toward the heady spheres of food and women. In this place of contradictions, erratic violence, and extreme temperatures, Kip learns to prepare local dishes and delicacies from around the globe. Even as months pass, Kip, a Sikh, feels secure in his allegiance to India, firmly on the right side of this interminable conflict. Then, one muggy day, a Pakistani \"terrorist\" with long, flowing hair is swept up on the banks of the river and changes everything. Mesmeric, mournful, and intensely lyrical, Chef is a brave and compassionate debut about hope, love, and memory set against the devastatingly beautiful, war-scarred backdrop of occupied Kashmir.",

Certainly there's an easier way to run out on a tab than being stabbed to death in the men's room.Talk about a rocky love life. Chloe's first date of the week is a murder victim. Her second date is with a perfectly sweet chef who'd be ideal if he wasn't the prime suspect. As the investigation plunges the amateur sleuth into the gourmet restaurant scene, she discovers a cutthroat world rife with killer competition, stormy love affairs, and a recipe for Baby Bok Choy Slaw to die for.",

After going missing ten years ago, the small private plane of Axel's late Uncle Magnus has finally been found in a remote lagoon, hundreds of miles south of the Big Island. So too have Magnus's few and scattered skeletal remains, exhumed by divers and now handed over to the only man who can fit together the pieces of this mystery.What forensic detective Gideon Oliver is discovering could shake the Torkelsson family tree to its very roots. But this time his work is yielding more questions about the past than answers. Questions about the long-ago execution-style murder of Magnus's brother...about a deadly dispute between rival ranching syndicates...about a mysterious will that benefits - as well as incriminates - its heirs...and most disturbing of all: questions as to the true identity of the corpse in the lagoon. But if it isn't Uncle Magnus...As lie upon lie is revealed, as secret upon secret is exposed, Gideon's only hope is to let the bones of the dead condemn the living - before the living take revenge.",

Her sense of daring and determination, rare for women of her time, brought her insurmountable fame from the day she became the first woman to cross the Atlantic in an airplane. In this definitive biography, Mary S. Lovell delivers a brilliantly researched account on Earhart's life using the original documents, letters, the logbooks of Earhart and her contemporaries, and personal interviews with members of Amelia's family, friends and rival aviatorsThe Sound of Wings vividly captures the drama and mystery behind the most influential woman in \"The Golden Age of Flight\"--from her tomboy days at the turn of the century and her early fascinations with flying, to the unique relationship she shared with G.P. Putnam, the flamboyant publisher and public relations agent who became both her husband and her business manager. It is a revealing biography of an uncommonly brave woman, and the man who both aided and took advantage of her dreams.",
