They dispel the \"one perfect person\" myth, encouraging women to abandon the search for Mr. Perfect and become comfortable with Mr. Right. Additionally, they share steps to becoming Mrs. Right. Among other attributes, readers will learn to look for men who:Are responsible men of integrityCommunicate effectivelyAre not misers with emotions, time, or moneyFor women confused by the dating game or seeking guidance in this major life decision,Finding Mr. Right is an essential resource.",

        "Description": "At the close of the nineteenth century, Theophile Valence and his wife, Suzanne, sail into the harbor of Santa Sofia, a remote Mexican copper-mining town. In the ship's hold are 2,348 pieces of a cast-iron church that has been designed by the great French engineer Gustave Eiffel - a monument to colonialism, and to the European faith in modernity, that Valence will assemble here in \"Lower California,\" on the fringes of empire.But neither Theo nor Suzanne is prepared for the effect her beauty and clairvoyance will have on the town and its inhabitants - an effect far greater than the incongruous church itself. As her husband applies himself faithfully to his work, the insular French community weighs the charms and merits of her presence, which also (and innocently) excites the imagination of a flamboyant Mexican officer and an itinerant American prospector. Meanwhile these tensions are reflected by those inherent to such a hybrid place: part European, part American and wholly apart from any world familiar to any of its inhabitants except the Indians whose labors account for its very existence.Part love story, part adventure, part mystery and part hallucination, Air & Fire is a magnificent tale of conflicting passions and cultures, set in a harsh and magical landscape where Parisian boulevards have been constructed in the dust, and where desires of all sorts exceed the opportunities of fulfillment. After the widely acclaimed Dreams of Leaving and The Five Gates of Hell, Rupert Thomson demonstrates yet again his extraordinary ability to merge real and invented landscapes into a transfixing world of his own, and furthers his position as one of England's most original and visionary new writers. And according to the London Daily Telegraph, \"If ever a book blazed with imagination and talent, it is his third novel, Air & Fire.\"",

        "Authors": "By Bass, Diana Butler",
        "Description": "For decades the accepted wisdom has been that America's mainline Protestant churches are in decline, eclipsed by evangelical mega-churches. Church and religion expert Diana Butler Bass wondered if this was true, and this book is the result of her extensive, three-year study of centrist and progressive churches across the country. Her surprising findings reveal just the opposite\u2014that many of the churches are flourishing, and they are doing so without resorting to mimicking the mega-church, evangelical style. Christianity for the Rest of Us describes this phenomenon and offers a how-to approach for Protestants eager to remain faithful to their tradition while becoming a vital spiritual community. As Butler Bass delved into the rich spiritual life of various Episcopal, United Methodist, Disciples of Christ, Presbyterian, United Church of Christ, and Lutheran churches, certain consistent practices\u2014such as hospitality, contemplation, diversity, justice, discernment, and worship\u2014emerged as core expressions of congregations seeking to rediscover authentic Christian faith and witness today. This hopeful book, which includes a study guide for groups and individuals, reveals the practical steps that leaders and laypeople alike are taking to proclaim an alternative message about an emerging Christianity that strives for greater spiritual depth and proactively engages the needs of the world.",

Total Recall follows the Chicago P.I. on a road that winds back more than fifty years \u2014 and into an intricate maze of wartime lies, heartbreaking secrets, and harrowing retribution. For V.I., the journey begins with a national conference in downtown Chicago, where angry protesters are calling for the recovery of Holocaust assets. Replayed on the evening news is the scene of a slight man who has stood up at the conference to tell an astonishing story of a childhood shattered by the Holocaust \u2014 a story that has devastating consequences for V.I.\u2019s cherished friend and mentor, Lotty Herschel. Lotty was a girl of nine when she emigrated from Austria to England, one of a group of children wrenched from their parents and saved from the Nazi terror just before the war broke out. Now stunningly \u2014 impossibly \u2014 it appears that someone from that long-lost past may have returned. With the help of a recovered-memory therapist, Paul Radbuka has recently learned his true identity. But is he who he claims to be? Or is he a cunning impostor who has usurped someone else\u2019s history ... a history Lotty has tried to forget for over fifty years?As a frightened V.I. watches her friend unravel, she sets out to help in the only way she can: by investigating Radbuka\u2019s past. Already working on a difficult case for a poor family cheated of their life insurance, she tries to balance Lotty\u2019s needs with her client\u2019s, only to find that both are spiraling into a whirlpool of international crime that stretches from Switzerland and Germany to Chicago\u2019s South Side. As the atrocities of the past reach out to engulf the living, V.I. struggles to decide whose memories of a terrible war she can trust, and moves closer to a chilling realization of the truth \u2014 a truth that almost destroys her oldest friend.With fierce emotional power, Sara Paretsky has woven a gripping and morally complex novel of crime and punishment, memory and illusion. Destined to become a suspense classic, Total Recall proves once again the daring and compelling genius of Sara Paretsky.",

Dean Koontz\u2019s Odd Thomas is one of those rare literary heroes who have come alive in readers\u2019 imaginations as he explores the greatest mysteries of this world and the next with his inimitable wit, heart, and quiet gallantry. Now Koontz follows Odd as he is irresistibly drawn onward to a destiny he cannot imagine and to undreamed of places where the perils he will face and the stakes for which he fights will eclipse all that he has known. The legend began in the obscure little town of Pico Mundo. A fry cook named Odd was rumored to have the extraordinary ability to communicate with the dead. Through tragedy and triumph, exhilaration and heartbreak, word of Odd Thomas\u2019s gifts filtered far beyond Pico Mundo, attracting unforgettable new friends\u2014and enemies of implacable evil. With great gifts comes the responsibility to meet great challenges. But no mere human being was ever meant to face the darkness that now stalks the world\u2014not even one as oddly special as Odd Thomas. After grappling with the very essence of reality itself, after finding the veil that separates him from his soul mate, Stormy Llewellyn, tantalizingly thin yet impenetrable, Odd longed only to return to a life of quiet anonymity with his two otherworldly sidekicks\u2014his dog Boo and a new companion, one of the few who might rival his old pal Elvis. But a true hero, however humble, must persevere. Haunted by dreams of an all-encompassing red tide, Odd is pulled inexorably to the sea, to a small California coastal town where nothing is as it seems. Now the forces arrayed against him have both official sanction and an infinitely more sinister authority\u2026and in this dark night of the soul dawn will come only after the most shattering revelations of all.Burnishing Dean Koontz\u2019s stature as a master of suspense and one of our most innovative and gifted storytellers, Odd Hours illuminates a legacy of mystery and hope that will shine on long after the final page.",

        "Title": "The Protestant Temperament: Patterns of Child-Rearing, Religious Experience, and the Self in Early America",
        "Authors": "By Greven, Philip J.",
        "Description": "Bringing together an extraordinary richness of evidence\u2014from letters, diaries, and other intimate family writing of the 17th and 18th centuries\u2014Philip Greven, the distinguished scholar of colonial history explores the strikingly distinctive ways in which Protestant children were reared, and the Protestant temperament shaped, in America.Through this cache of remarkable and remarkably immediate and moving material \u2013 the family papers of some of America\u2019s most famous theologians, political figures, lawyers, and ministers as well as those of lesser-known contemporaries (farmers, merchants, housewives) who embodied Protestant life and wrote about it most expressively\u2014Philip Greven traces the hidden continuities of religious experience, of attitudes toward God, children, the will, the body, sexuality, achievement, pleasure, virtue, and selfhood among the three Protestant groups of the time. He examines, in turn, the three strains that persisted regardless of denomination. First, the \u201cevangelicals\u201d (their dictum for raising children: \u201cBreak their wills that you may save their souls\u201d), ruled by a hostility to the self, a feeling that selfhood is the source of sin, too dangerous to be sought or desired (Jonathan Edwards wrote: \u201cI have been before God and have given myself, all that I am, and have, to God; so that I am not, in any respect, my own . . . I have given myself clear away\u201d). And we hear the products of this upbringing, in their twenties and thirties, speaking of themselves in the harshest tones (\u201cMy affections carnal, corrupt, and disordered\u201d), distrusting themselves in the most profound ways (a woman faced with the choice of a husband wrote: \u201cI dare not decide myself and dread nothing more than to be left to the Bent of my own heart\u201d).In counterpoint, we see the \u201cmoderates,\u201d poised between duty and personal desire, preoccupied but not obsessed with morality, more interested in self-control than self-suppression (an eminent Unitarian, the Reverend Theodore Parker of Boston, wrote: \u201cThe will needs regulation, not destroying. I should as soon think of breaking the legs of a horse in training him, as a child\u2019s will\u201d).And, finally, we see the \u201cgenteel\u201d in polite society, taking their state of grace for granted, more interested in self-assertion than self-control, completely at ease with ambition and worldliness\u2014music, dancing, games, convivial drinking, hunting, and sports all an integral part of the children\u2019s lives as they grow into maturity; the boys groomed for social responsibility, the girls encouraged to be \u201csteady, studious, docile, with a mild and winning presence, a sweet, obliging temper . . . \u201dThe Protestant Temperament uncovers the personal experience and the psychological and social effects of religion and piety in the American of the 17th and 18th centuries, the feelings as well as the beliefs of religious people. Fascinating and groundbreaking in its revelations and its radical reassessment of the role of religion in early American life, Philip Greven\u2019s book is a major intellectual event, an important and illuminating interpretation of the American Protestant experience.",

Deborah Norville's groundbreaking and persuasive book argues that gratitude is the secret key to unlocking your full life potential. Rooted in science, presented from a spiritual perspective, Thank You Power details the surprising life improvements that can stem from the practice of gratitude.Norville brings together for the first time the behavioral and psychological research that prove what people of faith have long known: giving thanks brings life blessings. Beginning with those two small words, thank you, Norville shows how you can be happier and more resilient, have better relationships, improved health, and less stress.The list of benefits is long. You'll exercise more, be more creative, bounce back more quickly from adversity, have a higher immune response, live longer, be better liked by others, and have more creativity in solving problems. Each of these outcomes is backed up by published research. The key? Gratitude.Ever heard the one about being able to catch more flies with honey than vinegar? If you want to eliminate many of the negatives of daily stress and better deal with the realities of your day, then read on. Deborah Norville may have found the real secret to happiness. You'll find the answer inside.--Dr. Mehmet Oz, Vice Chairman and Professor of Surgery, Columbia University; and Author, You SeriesDeborah Norville has proven that resilience is a big part of success.

Deborah Norville, in her latest book, Thank You Power, clearly lays out easy steps to put you on the path to a more positive lifestyle.--Anthony Robbins, Best-Selling Author, Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited PowerYour mother was right! You should say thank you about almost everything! Why? Because as Deborah Norville's new book proves, being positive and grateful leads to a happier, healthier, more successful life. And by the way, thank you for reading this, and thank you, Deborah, for writing this book.--Joan Rivers, EntertainerWhat a refreshing, positive read!

        "Description": "In this highly original approach to the history of the United States, James Moore focuses on the extraordinary role that prayer has played in every area of American life, from the time of the first settlers to the present day and beyond.A stirring chronicle of the spiritual life of a nation, One Nation Under God shows how the faith of Americans\u2014from the founding fathers to corporate tycoons, from composers to social reformers, from generals to slaves\u2014was an essential ingredient in the formation of American culture, character, commerce and creed. One Nation Under God brings together the country\u2019s hymns, patriotic anthems, arts, and literature as a framework for telling the story of the innermost thoughts of the people who have shaped the United States we know today. Beginning with Native Americans, One Nation Under God traces the prayer lives of Quakers and Shakers, Sikhs and Muslims, Catholics and Jews, from their earliest days in the United States through the advent of cyberspace, the aftermath of  9/11, and the 2004 presidential election. It probes the approach to prayer by such diverse individuals as Benjamin Franklin, Elvis Presley, Frank Lloyd Wright, Martha Graham, J. C. Penney, Mary Pickford, Cesar Chavez, P. T. Barnum, Jackie Robinson, and Christopher Columbus. It includes every president of the United States as well as America\u2019s farmers, clergy, immigrants, industrialists, miners, sports heroes, and scientists.One Nation Under God shows that without prayer, the political, cultural, social, and even economic and military history of the United States would be vastly different from what it is today. It engages in a thoughtful, timely examination of the modern debate over public prayer and how the current approach to prayer bears deep roots in the philosophies of the country\u2019s founding fathers, a subject which remains distinct from the debate over church and state.",

As the novel unfolds, we learn of her hidden erotic past: with alluring, elusive Stephen; with ethereal William, her high school boyfriend; with married, egotistical Adam, the painter who initiated her into the intimacies of the \"life room,\" where the artist\u2019s model sometimes becomes muse; and with loyal, steady Michael, her husband. On her return to New York, Eleanor and Stephen\u2019s charged attraction takes on a life of its own and threatens to destroy everything she has. Jill Bialosky has created a fresh, piercingly real heroine who struggles with the spiritual questions and dilemmas of our time and, like Tolstoy\u2019s immortal Anna Karenina, must choose between desire and responsibility.",

When El Salvadoran crime boss Rodrigo Gonz\u00e1lez is finally nabbed in Camden, New Jersey, for high-volume drug trafficking, he hires criminal defense attorneys Mickie Mezzonatti and Salvatore \"Junne\" Salerno, Jr. He's been told they're the best and that, as former Camden police officers, they know all the blind spots and loopholes (read: the ins and outs) of the local courts. All Rodrigo asks of Junne and Mickie is that they get him out on bond so he can jump bail and escape back to the comforts of El Salvador. Problem is, the judge denies bail. Soon Mezzonatti and Salerno are receiving a few unwelcome guests -- friends of Rodrigo -- asking questions. And the boys need to find answers, fast.   Mickie and Junne have an enviable professional success rate. With their street smarts and learned-on-the-job courtroom skills, the blue-collar boys enjoy trouncing self-righteous, Ivy-educated district attorneys. But they also know when they need help. Like with Rodrigo.   So they approach Professor Mumbles, a brilliant though eccentric former white-shoe lawyer who suffered a spectacular corporate burnout. As Junne and Mickie duck and dive to make Rodrigo's case (or at least fake it with Mumbles's help), they're also juggling their regular caseload -- like local drug lord Slippery Williams, whose badass nephew may have turned informant; and the gorgeous hooker Little Chip, whose prostitution bust leaves her pimp hopping mad. And through it all, the boys attempt to keep a happy home life. That's no sweat for Mickie, a natural Casanova, but it may prove to be trickier than Junne ever imagined. 'Cause he's got a secret. And if Rodrigo does not kill him, his family just might....   The first installment of a hilarious new series, Death by Rodrigo is a romp through the seamy side of criminal law by one of the foremost attorneys in America (who also has a wicked sense of humor).",

        "Authors": "By Steiner, Leslie Morgan (EDT)",
        "Description": "With motherhood comes one of the toughest decisions of a woman\u2019s life: Stay at home or pursue a career? The dilemma not only divides mothers into hostile, defensive camps but pits individual mothers against themselves. Leslie Morgan Steiner has been there. As an executive at The Washington Post, a writer, and mother of three, she has lived and breathed every side of the \u201cmommy wars.\u201d Rather than just watch the battles rage, Steiner decided to do something about it. She commissioned twenty-six outspoken mothers to write about their lives, their families, and the choices that have worked for them. The result is a frank, surprising, and utterly refreshing look at American motherhood.Ranging in age from twenty-five to seventy-two and scattered across the country from New Hampshire to California, these mothers reflect the full spectrum of lifestyle choices. Women who have been home with the kids from day one, moms who shuttle from full-time office jobs to part-time at-home work, hard-driving executives who put in seventy-hour-plus weeks: they all get a turn. The one thing these women have in common, aside from having kids, is that they\u2019re all terrific writers. Pulitzer Prize winner Jane Smiley vividly recounts how her generation stormed the American workplace\u2013only to take refuge at home when the workplace drove them out. Lizzie McGuire creator Terri Minsky describes what it felt like to hear her kids scream \u201cI hope you never come back!\u201d when she flew to L.A. to launch the show that made her career. Susan Cheever, novelist, biographer, and New York Newsday columnist, reports on the furious battles between the stroller pushers and the briefcase bearers on the streets of Manhattan. Lois R. Shea traded the journalistic fast track for a house in the country where she could raise her daughter in peace. Ann Misiaszek Sarnoff, chief operating officer of the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association, argues fiercely that you can combine ambition and motherhood\u2013and have a blast in the process.Candid, engaging, by turns unflinchingly honest and painfully funny, the essays collected here offer an astonishingly intimate portrait of the state of motherhood today. Mommy Wars is a book by and for and about the real experts on motherhood and hard work: the women at home, in the office, on the job every day of their lives.",

But Ripken is troubled by what he sees in youth sports: a competitive intensity that removes the element of fun from playing. Drawing from his experiences as a father, a player, and a coach, the legend offers his insights and advice here, including: how an overemphasis on winning can harm your child's game; why it's counterproductive to correct your child's technique during a game; how Ripken's techniques can be applied to other sports; and much more. Showcasing his proven philosophy (keep it simple, explain the \"why,\" celebrate the individual, and make it fun!), Ripken has created a plan that will delight baseball lovers for generations to come.--From publisher description.The former Baltimore Orioles baseball star shares his concerns about how youth sports has become more competitive than fun, in a guide for parents and coaches that explains how to avoid counter-productive coaching practices.",

Secrets of the Widow\u2019s Son will lead the reader along an incredibly fascinating, thought-provoking, and ultimately shocking trail of clues, codes, and long-forgotten history, from George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and the other Freemasons who were America\u2019s Founding Fathers to an American capital city that rivals The Da Vinci Code\u2019s Paris.

        "Description": "Most American soldiers can pinpoint a specific time when life stood still, when they thought, \"I'm going to remember this moment forever.\" It's times like these that have the power to change the future. Forever a Soldier\u2014drawn from the massive national collection of the Library of Congress Veterans History Project\u2014illustrates how American soldiers have answered the call to duty with a singular spirit of patriotism, and how military service has transformed their lives. Some of the remarkable stories include a World War II prisoner of war who describes desperate hours spent trying to conceal his Jewish heritage from his German captors; a nurse stationed in Vietnam who remembers a dying patient, his miraculous recovery, and her reward years later; and the survivor of a famed World War II shipwreck who flashes back to four harrowing days in the shark-infested waters of the Pacific Ocean. Culled from letters, diaries, and oral histories by soldiers, sailors, marines, and supporting citizens, these fifty stories constitute an astonishing historical record, a powerful tribute to those who fought, and a celebration of the enduring power of the words of few to speak for many. Forever a Soldier captures the personal perspective of war that is all too often lost in news reports and government statements. It is an indispensable contribution to understanding war and its impact on us all.",

And Alvin Miller, the seventh son of a seventh son, is a very special man indeed.Alvin is a Maker, and what he can make is a new future for America. But to do that he must defeat his ancient enemy, the Unmaker, whose cruel whispers and deadly plots have threatened Alvin's life at every turn.Now a grown man and a journeyman smith, Alvin has returned to his family and friends in the town of Vigor Church, to share in their isolation, to work as a blacksmith, and to try to teach anyone who will learn the knack of being a Maker. For Alvin has had a vision of the city he will build, and he knows that he cannot build it alone.But the Unmaker is not through with Alvin. If that spirit of destruction cannot stop him by magic, or war and devastation, then it will try to crush the young Maker by simpler means - more human means. By lies and innuendo, and by false accusations, Alvin is driven from his home back to Hatrack River, only to find that the Unmaker has been there before him, and that he must now stand trial for his life.",

Yet without understanding their ancient conflictand its modern embodiment in the power struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia for political and spiritual leadership of the Muslim worldit is impossible to comprehend events across the so-called Shia Crescent, from East Africa through Iraq and Pakistan to India.The provocative rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Saudi pressure on the United States not to unseat Saddam Hussein in 1991, the critical role of the Ayatollah Sistani and the religious establishment in Najaf (Iraq), the volatility of Pakistan today, and the consequences of the shift toward Shia power through American interventionall this and more is explained in the light of the Shia/Sunni divide.",

Distinguished commentator on foreign policy, former National Security Adviser Brzezinski, offers a reasoned but unsparing assessment of the last three presidential administrations' foreign policy. Though spanning less than two decades, these administrations cover a vitally important turning point in world history: the period in which the United States, having emerged from the Cold War withunprecedented power and prestige, managed to squander both in a remarkably short time. This is a tale of decline: from the competent but conventional thinking of the first Bush administration, to the well-intentioned self-indulgence of the Clinton administration, to the mortgaging of America's future by the \"suicidal statecraft\" of the second Bush administration. Brzezinski concludes with a chapter on how America can regain its lost prestige. This scholarly yet highly opinionated book is sure to be both controversial and influential.--From publisher description.",

Over the past decade, the world has seen the most powerful El Ni\u00f1o ever recorded, the most devastating hurricane in two hundred years, the hottest European summer on record, and one of the worst storm seasons ever experienced in Florida. With one out of every five living things on this planet committed to extinction by the levels of greenhouse gases that will accumulate in the next few decades, we are reaching a global climatic tipping point.  The Weather Makers  is both an urgent warning and a call to arms, outlining the history of climate change, how it will unfold over the next century, and what we can do to prevent a cataclysmic future. Along with a riveting history of climate change, Tim Flannery offers specific suggestions for action for both lawmakers and individuals, from investing in renewable power sources like wind, solar, and geothermal energy, to offering an action plan with steps each and every one of us can take right now to reduce deadly CO2 emissions by as much as 70 percent.",

        "Description": "This book traces the epic clash of values between traditional scenery-and-tourism management and emerging ecological concepts in the national parks, America\u2019s most treasured landscapes. It spans the period from the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872 to near the present, analyzing the management of fires, predators, elk, bear, and other natural phenomena in parks such as Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, and Great Smoky Mountains.Based largely on original documents never before researched, this is the most thorough history of the national parks ever written. Focusing on the decades after the National Park Service was established in 1916, the author reveals the dynamics of policy formulation and change, as landscape architects, foresters, wildlife biologists, and other Park Service professionals contended for dominance and shaped the attitudes and culture of the Service. The book provides a fresh look at the national parks and an analysis of why the Service has not responded in full faith to the environmental concerns of recent times.Richard West Sellars, a historian with the National Park Service, has become uniquely familiar with the history, culture, and dynamics of the Serviceincluding its biases, internal alliances and rivalries, self-image, folklore, and rhetoric. The book will prove indispensable for environmental and governmental specialists and for general readers seeking an in-depth analysis of one of America\u2019s most admired federal bureaus.",

As other nineteenth-century figures fade, Darwin's theory of evolution still provokes controversy, spilling over into curriculum battles at state and local school boards in the United States and around the world.In exploring the everyday artifacts of Darwin's life, his notebooks, and early manuscripts, Niles Eldredge \"a candid, no-punches-pulled interpreter of the core ideas of evolutionary biology\" (Science News) provides a rare glimpse into the mind of this highly intuitive, creative scientist. The celebration of Charles Darwin's 200th birthday in 2009 begins in November 2005 with the opening of a major exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, curated by Eldredge, that will travel across the nation. More than a companion book to the exhibit, Darwin is a rich and inspiring reconstruction of Darwin's life through his writings and discoveries.",

Now, Chuck Schumer, who has gained national prominence as the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and as a member of the Finance Committee, offers his plan for capturing the middle-class vote and moving his party back into the majority. Democrats can accomplish this, the senator explains, without abandoning their traditional principles.Schumer envisions a hypothetical, average middle-class American family--he thinks of them as \"The Baileys\"--who spend \"as much time talking about the cost of cornflakes as the cost of the national debt.\" He then details specific proposals he believes would keep America safe, secure, and on top; and support the aspirations of a prosperous and growing middle class while speaking to anxieties created in a world changed by technology and globalization. For example, he proposes to:\u2022 increase the number of college graduates by 50%\u2022 reduce property taxes by 50%",

Now Father Andrew M. Greeley, one of America\u2019s most beloved storytellers, examines the parables told by Jesus in search of a fuller understanding of the man and his message.This engaging and informal collection of homilies reveals a Jesus whose simple parables carry profound lessons about the Kingdom of Heaven. Along the way, Father Greeley touches on such provocative topics as the significance of Jesus\u2019s Jewish roots, his deep and revolutionary relationship with women, The Da Vinci Code, and The Passion of the Christ. He also singles out the four greatest parables, which best illustrate the infinite love and mercy of the God whose kingdom began with Jesus and continues even today.As a storyteller, Jesus often surprised his listeners with unexpected twists that challenged them to see the world in a whole new light. Father Greeley\u2019s insightful tour of the Gospels provides a fresh look at the parables that strips away centuries of false and mistaken interpretations to get at the essential truth of who Jesus really was and what he believed.",

        "Description": "From the best-selling author of Black Hawk Down comes a riveting, definitive chronicle of the Iran hostage crisis, America's first battle with militant Islam. On November 4, 1979, a group of radical Islamist students, inspired by the revolutionary Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini, stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran. They took fifty-two Americans hostage, and kept nearly all of them hostage for 444 days.In Guests of the Ayatollah, Mark Bowden tells this sweeping story through the eyes of the hostages, the soldiers in a new special forces unit sent to free them, their radical, na\u00efve captors, and the diplomats working to end the crisis. Bowden takes us inside the hostages' cells and inside the Oval Office for meetings with President Carter and his exhausted team. We travel to international capitals where shadowy figures held clandestine negotiations, and to the deserts of Iran, where a courageous, desperate attempt to rescue the hostages exploded into tragic failure. Bowden dedicated five years to this research, including numerous trips to Iran and countless interviews with those involved on both sides.Guests of the Ayatollah is a detailed, brilliantly re-created, and suspenseful account of a crisis that gripped and ultimately changed the world.",
