        "Description": "He&apos;s one of America&apos;s most recognizable and acclaimed actors&apos;a star on Broadway, an Oscar nominee for The Aviator, and the only person to ever win Emmys for acting, writing, and directing, during his eleven years on M*A*S*H. Now Alan Alda has written a memoir as elegant, funny, and affecting as his greatest performances.&apos;My mother didn&apos;t try to stab my father until I was six,&apos; begins Alda&apos;s irresistible story. The son of a popular actor and a loving but mentally ill mother, he spent his early childhood backstage in the erotic and comic world of burlesque and went on, after early struggles, to achieve extraordinary success in his profession.  Yet Never Have Your Dog Stuffed is not a memoir of show-business ups and downs. It is a moving and funny story of a boy growing into a man who then realizes he has only just begun to grow. It is the story of turning points in Alda&apos;s life, events that would make him what he is&apos;if only he could survive them.From the moment as a boy when his dead dog is returned from the taxidermist&apos;s shop with a hideous expression on his face, and he learns that death can&apos;t be undone, to the decades-long effort to find compassion for the mother he lived with but never knew, to his acceptance of his father, both personally and professionally, Alda learns the hard way that change, uncertainty, and transformation are what life is made of, and true happiness is found in embracing them.Never Have Your Dog Stuffed, filled with curiosity about nature, good humor, and honesty, is the crowning achievement of an actor, author, and director, but surprisingly, it is the story of a life more filled with turbulence and laughter than any Alda has ever played on the stage or screen.",

You'll see how other organizations handled pitfalls . . . analyze situations for which this method may not be appropriate . . . and find honest answers (and solutions) to common criticisms of the process.",

        "Description": "A phone call at two thirty in the morning is never good news. Lucie Montgomery's semiestranged brother, Eli, calls her in France to tell her their father, Leland, has been killed in a hunting accident on the family's five-hundred-acre Virginia vineyard just as the fall harvest is about to begin. By the time he calls, Eli has already made funeral arrangements with what Lucie argues is indecent haste.   It is an emotional trip home -- the first since an automobile accident two years ago, which left Lucie disabled and dependent on a cane. Her family's once elegant home and winery are now shabby and run-down, thanks to her father's penchant for fringy business deals. Eli, also cash-strapped and desperate to support his new wife's extravagant lifestyle, has already convinced their rebellious younger sister, Mia, to sell the debt-ridden estate and reap the profits from the valuable land it sits on, overruling Lucie's protests.   On the eve of the funeral Lucie's godfather, Fitz, a partner in the family business, tells her Leland's death was no accident. Whoever killed him was motivated by the potential sale of the vineyard. It is the last conversation she will have with Fitz. Now the lone holdout preventing the vineyard sale, Lucie realizes she's next in line for another \"accident.\" With her greedy brother, hell-raising sister, and a seemingly cut-rate vintner hired by Leland just before he died, all the suspects are disturbingly close to home. Unsure whom she can trust, Lucie must uncover the truth about the deaths of her father and godfather -- and oversee a successful harvest to save the vineyard she loves.   Set in the historic heart of Virginia's horse and hunt country, The Merlot Murders is filled with fascinating detail about the science and alchemy of wine making.",

Twelve-year-old Gabe  grew up in the foster care system until a social worker located his Uncle Vernon  two years before. When he comes home to discover that his uncle has died of a heart  attack, he's terrifed of going back into the system--so he tells no one. The next  day, he discovers a strange note in his mailbox:\u00a0\u00a0 I HAVE A SECRET. DO NOT BE AFRAID.\u00a0\u00a0 And his uncle's body is gone. \u00a0\u00a0 Thus begins a unique correspondence destined to save  the two people that depended on Vernon for everything. Through flashbacks, we learn  about Gabe and Vernon's relationship, and how finding each other saved them both  from lives of suffering. But eventually, Vernon's death will be discovered, and how  will Gabe and the mystery note writer learn to move forward?\u00a0\u00a0 The Mailbox is not a  story about death--though it begins with a death. It's also not a story about Vietnam  vets, although the author works with Vietnam veterans and wrote this novel, in part,  to illuminate their sacrifices and suffering. The Mailbox is a story about connections--about  how two people in need can save each other.Praise for The Mailbox:Junior Library Guild SelectionA Bank Street College Best Children's Books of the YearA Librarians'  Choices Booklist Selection\u201cShafer\u2019s narrative is heartfelt, earnest and moving. . . and conveys the power of memory to help heal wounds.\u201d\u2014Kirkus Reviews\u201cWarm and moving, it is an evocative picture of the weblike nature of  human existence and the interconnectedness of seemingly disparate  experiences.\u201d\u2014School Library Journal",

        "Description": "Previously published as The Trillion Dollar MeltdownNow fully updated with the latest financial developments, this is the bestselling book that briefly and brilliantly explains how we got into the economic mess that is the Credit Crunch. With the housing markets unravelling daily and distress signals flying throughout the rest of the economy, there is little doubt that we are facing a fierce recession. In crisp, gripping prose, Charles R. Morris shows how got into this mess. He explains the arcane financial instruments, the chicanery, the policy misjudgments, the dogmas, and the delusions that created the greatest credit bubble in world history. Paul Volcker slew the inflation dragon in the early 1980s, and set the stage for the high performance economy of the 1980s and 1990s. But Wall Street's prosperity soon tilted into gross excess. The astronomical leverage at major banks and their hedge fund and private equity clients led to massive disruption in global markets. A quarter century of free-market zealotry that extolled asset stripping, abusive lending, and hedge fund secrecy will go down in flames with it. Continued denial and concealment could cause the crisis to stretch out for years, but financial and government leaders are still downplaying the problem. The required restructuring will be at least as painful as the very difficult period of 1979-1983. The Two Trillion-Dollar Meltdown, updated to include the latest financial developments, is indispensable to understanding how the world economy has been put on the brink.",

        "Authors": "By Andersen, Christopher P.",
        "Description": "\"Dana is my life force.\"--Christopher Reeve\"A terrible thing happened. I wish it hadn't. But would I change who I married. . . . Never.\"--Dana ReeveHe was a hero in every sense of the word--the chiseled-from-granite star of four blockbusterSuperman films and the romantic classic Somewhere in Time who, after being paralyzed in a freak horseback riding accident, became a symbol of hope for millions. Dana Reeve was no less heroic, standing steadfastly by her husband's side until his surprisingly sudden and unexpected death at age fifty-two. When Dana, a non-smoker, passed away from lung cancer just seventeen months after Chris's death, she left behind their thirteen-year-old son, Will, to be raised by friends and family. Dana was only forty-four years old.That fate could have dealt such a cruel hand to this golden couple seemed unfathomable. That they could endure it all with grace, courage, and humor defied belief.Yet for all the millions of words that have been written about their public causes and private struggles following Chris's accident, little is known about the lives they led as passionate young lovers. Now, in the manner of his poignant-yet-stirring bestsellersJack and Jackie, Jackie After Jack, An Affair to Remember, The Day Diana Died, After Diana, andThe Day John Died, No. l New York Times bestselling author Christopher Andersen draws on those who knew them best to examine in touching detail the Reeves' unique partnership and the romance, faith, and fortitude that defined it.Sometimes heartbreaking, often uplifting, always compelling, Somewhere in Heaven is more than just a portrait of a marriage. It is the profoundly human story of two souls whose brief lives made a difference, a bittersweet saga of tragedy, triumph, and loss, and--above all else--a love story for the ages.",

At that point, the \u201cSpace Race\u201d became the central preoccupation of the great powers of the world.Now, in 1988, Marc has been assigned to Jamestown, the US-Commonwealth base on Venus, near the great Venusian city of Kartahown. Set in a countryside swarming with sabertooths and dinosaurs, Jamestown is home to a small band of American and allied scientist-adventurers.But there are flies in this ointment \u2013 and not only the Venusian dragonflies, with their yard-wide wings. The biologists studying Venus\u2019s life are puzzled by the way it not only resembles that on Earth, but is virtually identical to it. The EastBloc has its own base at Cosmograd, in the highlands to the south, and relations are frosty. And attractive young geologist Cynthia Whitlock seems impervious to Marc\u2019s Cajun charm.Meanwhile, at the western end of the continent, Teesa of the Cloud Mountain People leads her tribe in a conflict with the Neanderthal-like beastmen who have seized her folk\u2019s sacred caves. Then an EastBloc shuttle crashes nearby, and the beastmen acquire new knowledge\u2026 and AK47\u2019s.Jamestown sends its long-range blimp to rescue the downed EastBloc cosmonauts, little suspecting that the answer to the jungle planet\u2019s mysteries may lie there, among tribal conflicts and traces of a power that made Earth\u2019s vaunted science seem as primitive as the tribesfolk\u2019s blowguns. As if that weren\u2019t enough, there\u2019s an enemy agent on board the airship\u2026 Extravagant and effervescent, The Sky People is alternate-history SF adventure at its best.",

Only the reeves, who patrol on enormous eagles, still represent the Guardians' power.

        "Title": "Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court",
        "Authors": "By Greenburg, Jan Crawford",
        "Description": "Drawing on unprecedented access to the Supreme Court justices and their inner circles, acclaimed ABC News legal correspondent Jan Crawford Greenburg offers an explosive, newsbreaking account of one of the most momentous political watersheds in recent American history.  Over the past decade, the central front of America's bitter culture wars has been the titanic battle over the composition and direction of the United States Supreme Court. During that period, no journalist has been closer to the action on the ground-the ideas, the politics, the personalities, the gamesmanship-than ABC News correspondent Jan Crawford Greenburg. Now, in Supreme Conflict, Greenburg draws on all of her formidable reportorial resources to give a brilliant, vivid, astonishingly unvarnished account of the struggle for the soul of the highest court in the land.  Greenburg picks up the plot with the Rehnquist Court, which, despite having seven Republican nominees, proved deeply disappointing to conservatives hoping to reverse decades of progressive rulings on key social issues. She reveals for the first time the real story behind a series of failed Republican nominations that enraged the American conservative movement and left it seething with frustration and resolve not to squander future opportunities. Enter: George W. Bush and the setting of the stage for a full-blown conservative counterrevolution. Supreme Conflict contains entirely fresh perspectives across the entire sweep of its story, from the conservative movement's early fumbles with the nominations of justices Anthony Kennedy and David Souter to its crowning successes with the appointments of justices Roberts and Alito. The book breaks news in its revelations about the effect of Chief Justice Rehnquist's illness on the process; on the truth behind Harriet Miers's disastrous nomination and how it was really scuttled; and on how decades of bruising battles led to the triumph of the conservative agenda with the appointment of two of its leading judicial exponents. Through the entire dramatic story, rich in character and conflict, Greenburg never loses sight of the gargantuan stakes in this struggle, the opposing ideological agendas at play.  The story Jan Crawford Greenburg tells is that of the fulcrum event of our time, the massive coordinated campaign to move the Supreme Court in a very different direction, to a more limited and restrictive role in American government. A masterpiece of old-fashioned gumshoe reportage, rich storytelling, and penetrating analysis, Supreme Conflict will be the definitive account of the most consequential shift in the use of American judicial power in almost one hundred years.",

        "Description": "A psychologist and leadership expert explains how to harness the right level of anxiety  Most of us see anxiety as a bad thing, so at the first sign of it we try to fight back or run away. But according to Robert Rosen, this outdated view ignores one of the most powerful forces in business: Anxiety helps us concentrate, learn, relate to people, think more creatively, and deliver better results.  Of course, too much anxiety causes fear, chaos, and loss of morale. But too little leads to stagnation and a false sense of security. It\u2019s like a rubber band: If you pull it too hard, it breaks. If you don\u2019t pull it hard enough, you fail to maximize its potential. Finding the happy medium between panic and passivity is the secret to success.  Drawing on twenty years of research with CEOs, Rosen explains how great leaders succeed by living and leading with just enough anxiety. He shows how the ability to manage anxiety brings out their own best performance, enables them to build great teams, and inspires and challenges their organizations.  Only when we allow ourselves to feel our insecurity, discomfort, confusion, and pain can we reach our potential, both as individuals and teams. Just Enough Anxiety offers practical guidance to all kinds of organizations, blending cutting-edge psychology with real-world stories of success.",

Clear, concise, and powerful.IS THERE REALLY A LEGAL CASE AGAINST GEORGE W. BUSH?Saying aloud what\u2019s being said behind the scenes in the corridors of power . . .In these highly-charged political times, it is the word that dare not speak its name: impeachment. Democrats and other opponents of the President, as well as people in the media, are afraid to raise the topic for fear of being called too partisan or extreme.But the startling revelation of the President\u2019s warrantless wiretapping campaign may be the straw that broke the camel's back: In the halls of Congress and on the front pages of a growing number of mainstream periodicals, impeachment is being discussed more and more openly. And many leading constitutional scholars agree: there has never been so strong a case for impeachment since Richard Nixon.In Articles of Impeachment Against George W. Bush, Michael Ratner, Bill Goodman and other experts at one of our nation's leading institutions of constitutional scholarship, the Center for Constitutional Rights, set out the legal arguments for impeachment in a clear, concise, and objective discussion. In four separate articles of impeachment detailing four separate charges \u2013warrantless surveillance, misleading Congress on the reasons for the Iraq war, violating laws against torture, and subverting the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers \u2013 it is, say the CCR attorneys, a case of black letter law, with abundant evidence.Articles of Impeachment Against George W. Bush details that evidence, the relevant laws and the legal precedents. It also explains what the Constitution says about impeachment \u2013 an informative discussion further illuminated by supplemental material that includes a history of impeachment, explanation of its procedures, and the previous articles of impeachment brought against Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.With leading Republicans calling for investigations of the domestic spying campaign, a special prosecutor investigating the suppression of evidence used to launch the Iraq war, and hearings on innumerable instances of torture, In Articles of Impeachment Against George W.

Left behind are the boys mother, who is in a hospital in Boston recovering from a hysterectomy and Cyrus' son, the boys' half-brother, Lockwood. Today, at the end of the twentieth century, the details of the brothers' voyage are pieced together from ship logs and ancestral diaries by Sybil Braithwaite, their descendant. After picking up Will, their college friend in Maine, the boys decide to sail to the Florida Keys where Cyrus's last wreck, the Annisquam , lies below the remote key of Dry Tortugas. After days of sailing, they weather a storm that brings them near Beaufort, South Carolina, their mother's birthplace. In search of funds to repair their vessel, they visit their mother's wealthy aunt whom they have never met. While there, questions and suspicions about their mother's past begin to surface. Determined to reach their destination, the boys continue sailing the repaired boat to the Florida Keys in search of their father's former first mate who holds the secret of their Cyrus's last maritime adventure. Although they triumphantly reach the remains of the sunken Annisquam , the sea and the weather conspire against the sailors. They find themselves stranded in Havana with no easy passage home. As Sybil attempts to solve the mystery of her ancestors' journey, she unearths the family's deepest secrets and a shameful, inescapable truth. The supreme power of the sea, the enduring hand of history, and the strength of family collide in The Voyage 's explosive conclusion.",

        "Description": "I am now a condemned traitor . . . I am to die when I have hardly begun to live.Historical expertise marries page-turning fiction in Alison Weir\u2019s enthralling debut novel, breathing new life into one of the most significant and tumultuous periods of the English monarchy. It is the story of Lady Jane Grey\u2013\u201cthe Nine Days\u2019 Queen\u201d\u2013a fifteen-year-old girl who unwittingly finds herself at the center of the religious and civil unrest that nearly toppled the fabled House of Tudor during the sixteenth century.The child of a scheming father and a ruthless mother, for whom she is merely a pawn in a dynastic game with the highest stakes, Jane Grey was born during the harrowingly turbulent period between Anne Boleyn\u2019s beheading and the demise of Jane\u2019s infamous great-uncle, King Henry VIII. With the premature passing of Jane\u2019s adolescent cousin, and Henry\u2019s successor, King Edward VI, comes a struggle for supremacy fueled by political machinations and lethal religious fervor. Unabashedly honest and exceptionally intelligent, Jane possesses a sound strength of character beyond her years that equips her to weather the vicious storm. And though she has no ambitions to rule, preferring to immerse herself in books and religious studies, she is forced to accept the crown, and by so doing sets off a firestorm of intrigue, betrayal, and tragedy.Alison Weir uses her unmatched skills as a historian to enliven the many dynamic characters of this majestic drama. Along with Lady Jane Grey, Weir vividly renders her devious parents; her much-loved nanny; the benevolent Queen Katherine Parr; Jane\u2019s ambitious cousins; the Catholic \u201cBloody\u201d Mary, who will stop at nothing to seize the throne; and the protestant and future queen Elizabeth. Readers venture inside royal drawing rooms and bedchambers to witness the power-grabbing that swirls around Lady Jane Grey from the day of her birth to her unbearably poignant death. Innocent Traitor paints a complete and compelling portrait of this captivating young woman, a faithful servant of God whose short reign and brief life would make her a legend.\u201cAn impressive debut.

        "Description": "Most presidents have proclaimed the need for unity, civility, and cooperation. In reality, each has struggled to balance the sometimes conflicting roles of Commander-in-Chief, Chief Executive, and party leader. But between the familiar extremes of high-minded rhetoric and political horse-trading, some Presidents have succeeded in rallying the parties and the nation at crucial points in our history, while others have failed.  Call to Greatness examines how our next President can learn from the successes and failures of past Presidents to be an effective leader during a time of tremendous challenges at home and abroad.",
