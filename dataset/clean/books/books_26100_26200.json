        "Title": "The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to Great Britain and Ireland",
        "Authors": "By Eagle, Dorothy, Carnell, Hilary, and Stephens, Meic (EDT)",
        "Description": "When the Oxford Literary Guide first appeared, it was hailed by The Times of London as \"the finest reference work of its kind,\" while a TLS reviewer reported that he had road-tested the book on a journey from London to Herefordshire.  This trip normally takes under four hours.  His literary pilgrimage took four days.       Now in a new edition, with over 100 places added, as well as 137 more authors, this beautifully illustrated, over-sized volume lists hundreds of places in Britain and Ireland and details their connections with the lives of famous writers.  This popular guide provides over 300 illustrations of writers, their houses, and the landscapes that inspired them, as well as a wealth of curious information and entertaining anecdotes.  Take a tour of Poets' Corner, in Westminster Abbey, where you can find Chaucer's canopied tomb, a monument to Shakespeare with lines from The Tempest, the grave of Dickens, and tablets to Dylan Thomas, T.S. Eliot, and W.H. Auden, among many others.  Read how the Cumbrian Lake District's breathtaking scenery inspired the \"Lake Poets\" Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey, and how Keats' \"Ode to a Grecian Urn\" was written after he saw the Athenian sculptures at the British Museum.  Walk through Chelsea to see where of A.A. Milne, Mark Twain, and Bram Stoker lived.  Or travel off the beaten path, to Liverpool, for instance, where bankruptcy led Washington Irving to write the great American classic Rip Van Winkle, or to Muckross, where the author of Baron Munchausen, himself a spinner of tall tales, conned a landowner into buying property planted with samples of rich ore, or to Near Sawrey, where Beatrix Potter owned a seventeenth-century farmhouse.     Arranged for easy reference, with maps and an index of writers, The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to Great Britain and Ireland will help readers experience the richness of this great literary heritage.",

        "Title": "The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance",
        "Authors": "By Hale, J. R.",
        "Description": "In this extraordinarily rich and engaging book, John Hale has painted, on a grand canvas, what he calls \"an investigative impression\" of one of the highest points of European civilization: the flourishing, between 1450 and 1620, of the period we have come to call the Renaissance.It was an age that, wrote Marsilio Ficino in 1492, \"has like a golden age restored to light the liberal arts which were almost extinct: grammar, poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture, music.\" The book contains memorable descriptions of all of these. But Hale is not concerned simply with the arts: his interest is much wider. \"[This] was the first age in which the words 'Europe' and 'European' acquired a widely understood significance. It saw the emergence of a new and pervasive attitude to what were considered the most valued aspects of civilized life. It witnessed the most concentrated wave of intellectual and cultural energy that had yet passed over the continent...It was also a period in which there were such dramatic changes of fortune for better of worse - religious, political, economic and, through overseas discoveries, global - that more people than ever before saw their time as unique, referring to 'this new age,' 'the present age,' 'our age'; to one observer it was a 'blessed age,' to another, 'the worst age in history.\"'Hale paints his picture with an astonishing multiplicity of themes, people, and ideas. How did Europeans see themselves and others? What united them and separated them, both geographically and within their communities? What languages did they speak and write, and how widely? How did they fix themselves in time and space? What did they call civilized? What did they buy and sell? How did they dress and eat? What did they think about and how did they communicate their thoughts?One of the strengths of this book, which moves far beyond conventional or social history, is that it resists the temptation to answer any of these questions simply or glibly, or to impose unifying characteristics on the period or the continent. Instead, Hale allows people to speak for themselves, bringing the age to life with wonderful freshness, immediacy, and diversity. His canvas is not covered with broad brushstrokes, but with pointillist details and individual voices; there is something pleasing and unexpected in every corner.The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance is the most ambitious achievement of one of the world's leading Renaissance historians and is itself a landmark in the humanist tradition whose origins it describes. And at a time when the meanings of \"Europe\" and \"European\" culture are being questioned and debated, it is also a book that shows us where we can find the roots of both of them, and how much the present and future can be illuminated by the past.",

And since an eco-economy relies heavily on recycling materials already in the system, such as steel and aluminum, we learn how, in this new economy, recycling industries will largely replace mining industries. Bringing together in one volume the essential Eco-Economy Updates that are distributed worldwide over the Internet and published in the world's leading newspapers, The Earth Policy Reader monitors the shift from the old economy to the new.",

Charms and beseechings, hexes and potions, all have a place in the lives of the people of this world. Dowsers find water, the second sight warns of dangers to come, and a torch can read a person's future---or their heart.In this world where \"knacks\" abound, Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, is a very special man indeed. He's a Maker; he has the knack of understanding how things are put together, how to create them, repair them, keep them whole, or tear them down. He can heal hearts as well as bones, he build a house, he can calm the waters or blow up a storm. And he can teach his knack to others, to the measure of their own talent.Alvin has been trying to avert the terrible war that his wife, Peggy, a torch of extraordinary power, has seen down the life-lines of every American. Now she has sent him down the Mizzippy to the city of New Orleans, or Nueva Barcelona as they call it under Spanish occupation. Alvin doesn't know exactly why he's there, but when he and his brother-in-law, Arthur Stuart, find lodgings with a family of abolitionists who know Peggy, he suspects he'll find out soon. But Nueva Barcelona is about to experience a plague, and Alvin's efforts to protect his friends by keeping them healthy will create more danger than he could ever have suspected. And in saving the poor people of the city, Alvin will be put to the greatest test of his life---a test that will draw on all his power. For the time has come for him to turn to his old friend Tenskwa-Tawa, the Red Prophet who controls the lands to the west of the Mizzippy. Now Alvin must take the first steps on the road to the Crystal City that was shown to him in a vision so long ago.",

The thing is, Buddy is almost never at home, and there are indications that he is still \"seeing\" his old girlfriend Irene, now married to Chick, his former best friend.Virginia and Buddy had to get married. Little Madeline was conceived the first time they did it in Buddy's room at college, and Virginia's college asked her to leave when they found out. Her family put on a reluctant little wedding.

And this is the story of her actual life.There's no money, no love, no foreseeable future. Neither Virginia, who's nineteen, nor Buddy, who's just past twenty, has a clue about how to make things work. As we watch their story unfold through Virginia's eyes, hear it in her inimitable voice, we watch every character in it - from baby Madeline to Aunt Dot's flatulent Old Dog - stand up and walk off the page to take us by the hand and lead us back to those times and attitudes, to the pathos and comedy of those miserably romantic notions of bride-and-groom happiness.",

Venus already has been investigating a series of elk poachings nearby.The case is especially complicated because of the rumors swirling around Iron County. Superstitious villagers seem convinced that the baby wasn't kidnapped - more likely snatched by \"the Unknown,\" the monstrous creature villagers say roams the preserve in search of victims...",

        "Description": "Throw out the old playbook; the rules of the workplace are changing-and the push is coming from below. In Work 2.0, best-selling author Bill Jensen delivers a powerful and practical guide for managers and other leaders to make sense of the new covenant that is evolving between individuals and the organizations for which they work.Based on hundreds of interviews with managers, entrepreneurs, and front-line employees, Work 2.0 captures the pulse and the power of the people who are changing the workplace by raising their expectations of what it will offer to them. Work 2.0 introduces us to Belgian \"work simplifiers,\" the CEO of Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, Cisco's rule-breaking head of eLearning, the founder of Google, and many other pioneers who are creating workplaces that operate from the employee's point of view. They are meeting the needs of a new workforce, who want to be exceptionally productive, intellectually stimulated, and highly valued. In short, these new workers are demanding a maximum return on their investment in the company. Work 2.0 is guaranteed to change forever the way you think about workers, the workplace, and the very nature of work. In Work 2.0 Jensen reveals how: Productivity gets personal Most likely, your company still thinks about productivity in terms of producing more at less cost. Your employees believe that it's about how efficiently and effectively your company helps them get stuff done. They want more control over their own destiny, and your company is a tool to help them succeed. Working capital will be spent differently The workforce knows that your company uses their capital-time, ideas, knowledge, passion, and energy-to make profits. Your key talent is only interested in spending this capital on high-impact projects, learning something new, or doing what they find interesting. This is true in boom times, and really true in bear times. The work force wants a better return on their investment If an hour invested in your firm could be invested in a competitor for greater return to the employee, your most valuable people will leave.",

Dr. Dale Matthews, armed with the best clinical and scientific data, confirms what many patients have long suspected but many doctors don't acknowledge: faith and religious practice can be valuable medicine.In this comprehensive book, Dr. Matthews, a leader in the field, seeks to revive the ancient connection between science and religion, restoring them to their original roles as the twin traditions of healing. The neglect of religious values and practices in medical settings has serious implications - not only for doctors, patients, and national health policy, but also in the treatment of hypertension, drug abuse, depression, cancer, heart disease, and more. Solidly grounded in the latest scientific evidence, The Faith Factor is filled with remarkable case histories from Dr. Matthews's own practice, where he prescribes both faith and medicine, prayer and Prozac.",

        "Authors": "By Winterson, Jeanette",
        "Description": "'Here follows a story of time, universe, love affair and New York. The Ship of Fools, a Jew, a diamond, a dream. A working-class boy, a baby, a river, the sub-atomic joke of unstable matter.'Funny, tender and full of surprises Gut Symmetries is a celebration of love in all its frailty, confusion and excess. Set on board the QE2, and in New York and Liverpool, Gut Symmetries explores parallel lives, loves and universes.'This is a true story. If it seems strange, ask yourself, \"what is not strange?\" If it seems unlikely, ask yourself, \"what is likely?\"'Gut Symmetries asks us to redefine not only what is likely but what is possible. This is a story of earth and heaven; sex and the spirit; the real and the fantastic; male and female; science and religion. Gut Symmetries opens up a world where nothing is what it seems - 'What you see is what you think you see'.",
