        "Description": "Harried suburban single mom and delightfully incorrigible busybody Jane Jeffry returns to do some dangerous housecleaning in another charming whodunit from America's Agatha Award-winning answer to Dame Agatha Christie: Jill Churchill.Homemaking is about to take on a whole new meaning for Jane Jeffry now that she's agreed to help restore and redecorate a decrepit old neighborhood mansion. The home's owner, the prosperously divorced Bitsy Burnside, considers herself to be a feminist to the max and wants an almost all-female crew to do the dirty work -- prompting the quick-witted Shelley Nowack to dub the project \"the House of Seven Mabels.\" With her best friend and decorating whiz Shelley on the estrogen-heavy team, Jane thinks this exhausting, plaster-dusty job may not be as unpleasant as it initially appeared to be.Until, of course, things start to get very messy. It begins with a series of mean-spirited \"pranks\" -- strange odors, mysterious electrical shorts, a myriad of petty annoyances designed to impede the progress of the fixer-uppers. And then the pranks turn deadly, leaving one of the workers lying lifeless at the foot of a staircase.Tragic, yes, but an accident? Jane thinks not. And with the able assistance of Shelley, not to mention a little help from her best beau, Chicago detective Mel VanDyne, Jane's hoping she can construct a solid case and nail the assassin. Suspects are certainly in abundant supply. The surviving members of Bitsy's building brigade all had the opportunity. Joe Budley -- the contractor originally hired, then fired when Bitsy had her \"no men allowed\" epiphany -- had a motive. But the more Jane saws away at the truth, the more complicated the criminal blueprint appears. And she may be painting herself into a comer, leaving no exit if a crafty killer decides to make Jane Jeffry the next demolition project.",

        "Title": "The Best American Science Writing 2003",
        "Authors": "By Sacks, Oliver W. (EDT) and Cohen, Jesse (EDT)",
        "Description": "In his introduction to The Best American Science Writing 2003, Dr. Oliver Sacks, \"the poet laureate of medicine\" New York Times writes that \"the best science writing . . . cannot be completely 'objective' -- how can it be when science itself is so human an activity? -- but it is never self-indulgently subjective either. It is, at best, a wonderful fusion, as factual as a news report, as imaginative as a novel.\" Following this definition of \"good\" science writing, Dr. Sacks has selected the twenty-five extraordinary pieces in the latest installment of this acclaimed annual.      This year, Peter Canby travels into the heart of remote Africa to track a remarkable population of elephants; with candor and tenderness, Floyd Skloot observes the toll Alzheimer's disease is taking on his ninety-one-year-old mother, and is fascinated by the memories she retains. Gunjan Sinha explores the mating behavior of the common prairie vole and what it reveals about the human pattern of monogamy. Michael Klesius attempts to solve what Darwin called \"an abominable mystery\": How did flowers originate? Lawrence Osborne tours a farm where a genetically modified goat produces the silk of spiders in its milk. Joseph D'Agnese visits a home for retired medical research chimps. And in the collection's final piece, Richard C. Lewontin and Richard Levins reflect on how the work of Stephen Jay Gould demonstrated the value of taking a radical approach to science.     As Dr. Sacks writes of Stephen Jay Gould -- to whose memory this year's anthology is dedicated -- an article of his \"was never predictable, never dry, could not be imitated or mistaken for anybody else's.\" The same can be said of all of the good writing contained in this diverse collection.",

        "Title": "The Children of Noah",
        "Authors": "By Patai, Raphael, Hornell, James, and Lundquist, John M.",
        "Description": "Here the late Raphael Patai (1910-1996) recreates the fascinating world of Jewish seafaring from Noah's voyage through the Diaspora of late antiquity. In a work of pioneering scholarship, Patai weaves together Biblical stories, Talmudic lore, and Midrash literature to bring alive the world of these ancient mariners. As he did in his highly acclaimed book The Jewish Alchemists, Patai explores a subject that has never before been investigated by scholars. Based on nearly sixty years of research, beginning with study he undertook for his doctoral dissertation, The Children of Noah is literally Patai's first book and his last. It is a work of unsurpassed scholarship, but it is accessible to general readers as well as scholars. An abundance of evidence demonstrates the importance of the sea in the lives of Jews throughout early recorded history. Jews built ships, sailed them, fought wars in them, battled storms in them, and lost their lives to the sea. Patai begins with the story of the deluge that is found in Genesis and profiles Noah, the father of all shipbuilders and seafarers. The sea, according to Patai's interpretation, can be seen as an image of the manifestation of God's power, and he reflects on its role in legends and tales of early times. The practical importance of the sea also led to the development of practical institutions, and Patai shows how Jewish seafaring had its own culture and how it influenced the cultures of Mediterranean life as well. Of course, Jewish sailors were subject to the same rabbinical laws as Jews who never set sail, and Patai describes how they went to extreme lengths to remain in adherence, even getting special emendations of laws to allow them to tie knots and adjust rigging on the Sabbath. The Children of Noah is a capstone to an extraordinary career. Patai was both a careful scholar and a gifted storyteller, and this work is at once a vivid history of a neglected aspect of Jewish culture and a treasure trove of sources for further study. It is a stimulating and delightful book.",

        "Description": "The Braswell family had everything people would kill for: money, looks, power. But their eldest son, the family's shining light, died in a bizarre fishing accident. And when he disappeared-hauled into the depths by the giant marlin he had been fighting-he took with him a secret so corrupt that it could destroy the Braswells. Ten years later, a huge airliner crashes in the steamy shallows off the Florida coast, killing all aboard. Helping pull bodies from the water, Thorn finds himself drawn into a bizarre conspiracy: someone has developed a high tech weapon capable of destroying electrical systems in a powerful flash. The terrorist potential is huge. How are the secretive Braswells and their family-owned company, MicroDyne, involved? And what does it have to do with the family's obsessive hunt for the great marlin that killed their golden boy? With the Braswells, James W. Hall introduces one of the most evil and dysfunctional families in the history of fiction. And, along with Thorn, he brings back favorite characters from his earlier books, including Alexandra Rafferty and her father, Lawton Collins, a retired and increasingly dotty former police investigator whose methods of investigation result in his kidnapping. A story that bristles with all the heat and tension of a tropical Florida summer, Blackwater Sound is destined to rank among the greatest suspense thrillers of the new decade.",

In a novel both exciting and frighteningly realistic, Harold Coyle demonstrates once again that one of the nation's most important struggles is being fought on its own territory.Freedom. It is brought settlers to America's coasts, and it's the ideal that many laid down their lives to preserve. But, as the greatest nation in the world enters the new millennium, America finds itself once again split over the concept of liberty and justice for all.When one man decides to send a message to the government by bombing a federal building, the explosion is felt all across the country. The chain reaction that follows resonates most powerfully with members of a rebel band in Idaho who call themselves \"Patriots\" they want freedom from government control, no matter how much deadly force it takes. Their well-planned acts of terrorism soon show the government that they cannot be ignored and that definite action is needed.Thrown into the battle is Lieutenant Nathan Dixon, fresh from VMI, and a soldier who stands in the very large shadow of his father, the revered General Scott Dixon. Sent to quell a potentially dangerous situation, he'll need every bit of his training, for Nathan finds himself catapulted into the first battle of a new American war of secession.Covering the news is Nathan's stepmother, prominent anchorwoman Jan Fields. As the country watches, Jan discovers that Idaho's charismatic governor, George Oliver \"GO\" Thomas has an agenda of his own, one that may truly have a revolutionary effect on the whole country.Using the hard-edged style that made him famous, Harold Coyle takes us inside an all too plausible America where a nation is divided over the ideals on which this country was founded. In this modern military thriller, Coyle gives us an intimate portrait of the men and women who fight to uphold their, visions of America against all enemies.",

        "Description": "In a small town in Northern Ireland, in the troubling psychedelic-gone-wrong atmosphere of the late seventies, Joey Tallon embarks on a journey of selfhood, of redemption, and of rebirth. A man deranged by desire, and longing for belonging, with the words of T. S. Eliot as his guide -- \"We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time\" -- Tallon searches for his \"place of peace,\" a spiritual landscape located somewhere between Ireland and Iowa, and maybe between heaven and hell.Following the delusional, but also ultimately likable, Tallon on his quest, we unwittingly enter a world constructed by a character who is arguably more lucid during his acid trips than when he's sober. What begins as a baffling mystery in McCabe's hands becomes a raucous and ribald adventure. From Tallon's punk rock beginnings, to his stewardship of his prison's literary society, to his brief tenure as director of the Youth in Action Creative Arts Awareness Scheme, and finally to his bull-like charge into the political arena, Joey's journey toward enlightenment and deliverance takes readers into the innermost heart of a man at odds with himself and the violent, sometimes surreal world around him.Hilarious, poignant, and unpredictable, Call Me the Breeze is a literary odyssey five years in the making. It is Patrick McCabe at his absolute best.",

        "Title": "Joseph's Bones: Understanding the Struggle Between God and Mankind in the Bible",
        "Authors": "By Segal, Jerome M.",
        "Description": "It's almost impossible to think of the Bible as anything other than the expression of the religious traditions that view it as Holy Scripture. Yet given that vital parts of it were written as much as a thousand years before the emergence of rabbinic Judaism and the birth of Christianity, there is no obvious reason why this should be true. In his groundbreaking new book, Joseph's Bones: Understanding the Struggle Between God and Mankind in the Bible, philosopher Jerome Segal offers a fresh and vigorous reexamination of the oldest part of the Bible.  In Joseph's Bones, Segal asks you to imagine that you know nothing about Judaism or Christianity and one day pick up something called \"The Hexateuch\" (the first six books of the Bible). How would you understand the story it recounts? Who is God? And who are the Israelites? And perhaps most important, what is the relationship between God and humanity?  Segal maintains that if we approach the Bible without preconceptions, we will find something unexpected: a brilliant, sophisticated, and highly cohesive account of the human condition. He argues that the Bible reads like an existential novel about the struggle between God and mankind, and is far more sympathetic to mankind than to God.  Segal frames his analysis by considering the tale of Joseph's bones. In the closing words of Genesis, as Joseph lies dying in Egypt, Joseph has the \"sons of Israel\" swear that when God returns the Israelites to the Promised Land, they will take his bones with them. Some four hundred years later, as the Book of Joshua closes, the Israelites honor this commitment by returning and burying Joseph's bones in Canaan, as their ancestors had pledged.  Noting that throughout the early parts of the Bible God often seethes with anger at the Israelites, calling them \"faithless\" and \"wicked,\" Segal uses the story of Joseph's faith in his people and their fidelity to him to illustrate how the Bible does not always share God's perspective on the Israelites or on mankind in general.  Segal then provides a systematic reinterpretation of the Bible story and comes to see it as the people's book, written as a way to understand the human condition in a universe governed by a powerful and morally complex deity.  He contends that the Bible does not view morality as dependent on God. Rather, it understands moral truths to be objective aspects of reality that limit even God's freedom of action, though God himself resists such a notion. Segal maintains that in the great saga of mankind's struggle with God, Abraham and Moses emerge as heroes, each seeking to protect mankind from God's unpredictable and often unwarranted wrath. The book's final section explores how this rethinking of the Hexateuch transforms the story of Jesus in the New Testament in ways neither Christians nor Jews have considered.  Both a radically new way of understanding the Biblical texts and a lively examination of it, Joseph's Bones is an anomaly of Biblical interpretation: brilliant, rigorously argued, and thoroughly original. It is at once persuasive scholarship and a captivating read.",

In hardcover, Downsize This! stormed the bestseller lists of the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle and others.

Why do some men still choose to be traditional breadwinners while others flee the responsibilities of parenthood altogether, and still others become infinitely more involved in family life than earlier generations of men? Here&#39;s a look at how men are coping with the gender revolution.",

Along the way, he has authored the #1 New York Times bestseller Chutzpah; the bestselling account of the Claus von Bulow case Reversal of Fortune; and the bestselling courtroom drama The Advocate's Devil. Now Dershowitz has written a novel that is at once personal, passionate, and towering: an explosive legal thriller that pits Dershowitz's literary alter ego, attorney Abe Ringel, against the worst crime of the twentieth century -- the Holocaust.What if you witnessed the most abominable deeds that human beings can inflict upon each other? What if you came face-to-face with the very man who had slaughtered your family before your eyes? That is the question confronted by a celebrated professor named Max Menuchen. Max has found the man who had killed his entire family in cold blood more than a half century before. Max, who has never before broken a law, cannot turn down his chance for revenge.In 1943 Marcellus Prandus was a Lithuanian militia captain who carried out the blood-thirsty orders of his Nazi commanders during World War II. Today he is an old man living outside Boston. For Max, who has discovered Prandus's identity by chance, killing him is not enough, because Prandus is already dying of cancer. How can Max make Prandus suffer exactly as Max himself did? Can Max bring himself to assassinate Prandus's children and grandchildren and make the old man watch his family die, as Max himself was forced to do?By the time defense attorney Abe Ringel enters the case, Max has carried out an astounding act of revenge, and America'sgreat Holocaust trial has begun: an explosive legal and moral struggle to find the light of justice within the darkness of human evil. With Max facing almost certain conviction, Ringel desperately tries to prove his actions we",

In A Miracle Every Day Golden, once a single mother herself, and several other single mothers and their family members share their success stories with great honestly and insight. Golden identifies the coping characteristics these families have in common and organizes them into guiding themes, making A Miracle Every Day a book that single mothers and their support networks can turn to for wisdom, comfort, and inspiration.",

Some money from each copy of Speaking with the Angel sold will benefit autism education charities around the world, including The Treehouse School in London, where Nick\u2019s son Danny is a student, and the New York Child Learning Institute here in the States.

Among the issues to be covered: \u2022 To understand how a daughter's attachment to her mother\u2014more so than her relationship with her father\u2014colors all her other relationships, and to analyze why it is more difficult for daughters than sons to separate from their mothers, as well as why daughters are more subject than sons to a mother's manipulation\u2022 To recognize the difference between a healthy and a destructive mother-daughter connection, and to define clearly the \u201cbad mommy,\u201d in order to help readers who have trouble acknowledging their childhood losses to begin to comprehend them\u2022 To conjugate what I call the \u201cBad Mommy Taboo\u201d\u2014why our culture is more eager to protect the sanctity of maternity than it is to protect emotionally abused daughters \u2022 To describe the evolution of the \"unpleasable\" mother\u2014in all likelihood, she was bereft of maternal love as a child\u2014and to recognize the huge, and often poignant, stake she has in keeping her grown daughter dependent and off-balance\u2022 To illustrate the consequent controlling behavior\u2014in some cases, cloaked in fragility or good intentions\u2014of such mothers, which falls into general patterns, including: the Doormat, the Critic, the Smotherer, the Avenger, the Deserter \u2022 To understand that the daughter has a similar stake in either being a slave to or hating her mother\u2014the two sides of her depen dency and immaturity \u2022 To illustrate the responsive behavior\u2014and survival mechanisms \u2014of daughters, which is determined in part by such variables as birth rank, family history, and temperament, and which also falls into patterns, including: the Angel, the Superachiever, the Cipher, the Troublemaker, the Defector \u2022 To show how to redefine the mother-daughter relationship, so that each can learn to see and accept the other as she is today, appreciating each other's good qualities and not being snared by the bad\u2022 Finally, to demonstrate that a redefined relationship with one's mother\u2014adult to adult\u2014frees you from the past, whether that re definition ultimately results in real friendship, affectionate truce, or divorce.",

Since its original publication in 1899, the work has become a classic of social and economic thought and policy and exerted an influence widely felt beyond the sphere of economics.For Veblen, the shallowness and superficiality of society resulted from the tendency to believe that true accomplishment lay in arriving at a condition of ostentatious wealth and status. In developing this thesis, he traces the origins and development of ownership and property, offering extraordinary insights into the phenomenon of consumerism, the evolution of class structure, the rise of leisure time and how modern societal goals are grounded in pecuniary aspirations and achievements.Students, sociologists, historians, economists \u2014 anyone interested in the motives and behavior of human beings within a large-scale social context \u2014 will find this time-honored investigation still relevant and readable over a century after its first appearance. It belongs in the library of every thinking person.",

From the unhappy family relationships of prominent Americans to the feuds, smear campaigns, duels, and infamous sex scandals that have punctuated our history, we see our founding fathers and other American heroes in the course of their all-too-human events. Ineffectual presidents, lazy generals, traitors; treacherous fathers, nagging mothers, ungrateful children, embarrassing siblings; and stories about insanity, death, and disturbing postmortems are all here, as are disagreeable marriages, vile habits, and, of course, sex: good sex, bad sex, and good-bad sex too. We can take comfort in the fact that we are no worse and no better than our forebears. But we do have better media coverage.

This streak of proud nationalism, interwoven with elements of Celtic lore and mysticism, and infused with a hard-earned wisdom, makes Yeats's works resonate to this day.

These memorable verses, embodying subtlety and objectivity in language of stark beauty and simplicity, offer a cross-section of Yeat's multifaceted poetic production.In addition to the famous title poem, the works collected here include the oft-quoted \"The Second Coming\" as well as \"An Irish Airman Foresees His Death,\" \"The Wild Swans at Coole,\" \"In Memory of Major Robert Gregory,\" \"Under the Round Tower,\" \"Michael Robartes and the Dancer,\" \"The Rose Tree,\" \"A Prayer for My Daughter,\" \"A Meditation in Time of War,\" and many more.",

Detective Sergeant Peter Decker of the LAPD had just witnessed the birth of his healthy, strapping daughter only to see his wife, Rina, suddenly whisked away into the emergency room with complications from her long, hard labor. For a while, it was touch and go. But just as things start to calm down and Rina seems to be on the road to recovery, a different tragedy strikes. Another family is thrown into an agony that only new parents can know - Baby Girl Rodriguez has been stolen from tbe hospital nursery. The family's ordeal is Peter's as well, because it is the very nursery where his daughter peacefully slept that same night. The head nurse, Marie Bellson, seems to be missing as well. Despite his exhaustion, Peter makes it his professional and personal mission to find Baby Girl Rodriguez and the nurse who allegedly stole her.Bellson and the infant have vanished without a trace. Nobody in the hospital saw them leave, not even Decker's own grown daughter, Cindy, who was tending to her half sister that night. Everyone interviewed agrees that Marie Bellson was fanatically devoted to the welfare of the newborns and would sooner die than harm one. That reputation, and a suspicious bloodstain on the floor of the hospital garage, are all that remain of the night nurse. Until Bellson's car is found at the bottom of a cliff.Chilled by the thought of a baby floating free in a dangerous world, Peter and his partner, Marge Dunn, drive themselves to untangle Bellson's murky past. What they find is a double life with roots in the radical sex and drug culture of the sixties, a tragically broken home, a male geriatric nurse with something to hide, and a mysterious lady bodybuilder who knows too much. Torn between his own family's pressing needs and his obession with finding the missing infant, Decker refuses to let Baby Girl Rodriguez be chalked up as just another statistic. But the harder Decker works, the more he realizes time is running out...Peter Decker of the LAPD and his beautiful, sharp-witted, Orthodox Jewish wife, Rina Lazarus, continue to be one of the most intriguing mystery couples around.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Dictionary of New Words: A Popular Guide to Words in the News",

        "Description": "What does \"mirror-shades group\" mean? (Is it a solar power array, a school of science fiction, a slang word for \"corporate raiders\"?) Who first coined the word \"factoid\"? When and where does the \"triple witching hour\" occur? What do the acronyms DINK and NIMBY stand for? On what kid's show was the cry \"Cowabunga\" first heard? Why is the term \"acupressure\" something of a misnomer?       In The Oxford Dictionary of New Words, Sara Tulloch examines over two thousand new words and phrases that have become part of our daily lives in the last decade, in 750 articles that provide pronunciation, definition, etymology, informal history, and sample sentences. Drawing words from politics, the environmental movement, computers and technology, business, sports, entertainment, and many other areas, Tulloch goes beyond the usual informative but narrow dictionary entry to offer readers a rich history of the recent changes not only in our language but in our culture as well. Just skimming the headwords is like fast-forwarding through the eighties: bailout, cocooning, deniability, the disappeared, glasnost, lambada, safe sex, spin doctor, fun run, insider trading, genetic fingerprinting, thirtysomething, designer water, liposuction, Cablevision, gentrification, intifada, and DINK (Double Income, No Kids). And the histories that Tulloch provides are so interesting that even if you know the meaning of a word you will find the article fascinating. For instance, readers discover that the expression \"Cowabunga,\" popularized most recently by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, dates back to the old \"Howdy Doody Show\" of the '50s; that \"couch potato\" was coined by Californian Tom Iacino (who also commends television-watching as \"transcendental vegetation\") and that the word \"factoid\" was coined by Norman Mailer in his book Marilyn; that the name of the Black South African party \"Inkatha\" comes from a Zulu word for a sacred head-ring believed to ensure solidarity; that the \"cellular\" in \"cellular phone\" refers to the small geographic sections or \"cells\" into which each operating area is divided; that \"mouse\" has been a computer term since 1965 and \"mousse\" has gone from dessert to hair styling product to the frothy oil-and-seawater mixture left behind oil spills; and that Lenin used the term \"glasnost\" to mean \"freedom of information\" half a century before Gorbachev did.       Here then is a resource that is both useful and intriguing, the first place to turn when faced with such new words and phrases as \"acyclovir,\" \"magnetic resonance imaging,\" \"Alar\" or \"computer footprint,\" as well as a browser's delight, a goldmine of language for word lovers everywhere.",

        "Title": "Rama Revealed: The Ultimate Encounter",
        "Authors": "By Clarke, Arthur C. and Lee, Gentry",
        "Description": "In the long-awaited conclusion to one of the most heralded science fiction series ever, Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee reveal the ultimate Raman plan for humanity. The Hugo and Nebula award-winning Rendezvous with Rama, the bestselling Rama II, and The Garden of Rama were only the prelude to this stunning conclusion to an epic journey.On its mysterious voyage through interstellar space, a massive, alien starship carries its passengers to the end of a generations-long odyssey. For the great experiment conceived by the Ramans has failed. Rama III, with its carefully designed Earth habitat, as well as environments to house other intelligent species, has become a battleground.Instead of creating a utopia, the human contingent has brought forth a tyrant who seeks to conquer the other sectors of the vast Raman ark. Cosmonaut Nicole des Jardins, a lone voice for reason who is now jailed and awaiting execution, is aided in a daring escape by two tiny robots. On New York Island, the dark, brood deserted city in the midst of Rama III's cylindrical sea, Nicole is reunited with her long-lost husband, Richard Wakefield, whom she'd given up for dead.Joined by their children and other rebels from the Earth sector, Nicole and Richard enter New York's labyrinthine underground aboard a ghostly subway hoping to find the ship's secret inner workings. What they find instead is the emerald-domed lair of the technologically advanced species that rules this fabulous subraman world: the octospiders. These arachnidlike creatures are luring Nicole and the rebels into their domain, but the Earth group is divided as to whether the octospiders are allies or enemies - and anxious to discover the fate of two of their group abducted by the enigmatic aliens.Yet even as this drama unfolds, Rama III continues its inexorable course to its final destination: the Node. To some, the Node is a vast engineering station; to others, it is a place of wonder and miracles. From here a powerful force has been monitoring all of the lifeforms on Rama III, summoning the survivors to a final judgment. And it is here that the stunning climax of the Rama journey awaits: the shattering revelation of the true identity of the beings behind this strange, glittering trek across the cosmos.",
