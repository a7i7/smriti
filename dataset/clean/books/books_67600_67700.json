        "Description": "In 49 B.C., a civil war between the forces loyal to Pompey and Julius Caesar has engulfed the Roman world and no one is allowed to be neutral. With Rome itself in turmoil, Gordianus the Finder receives an anonymous message informing him of the death of his son, Meto, who lately has been acting as a double agent for Caesar. In search of the truth about Meto's fate, Gordianus journeys to the besieged seaport of Massilia, which has sided with Pompey and is now stubbornly holding out against Caesar's troops camped just outside its gates and in ships in the harbor.Using his wits, Gordianus discovers a way past the siege troops and into Massilia. But once there he finds that famine and slaughter threaten the populace, and intrigue and recriminations have taken over the city that cannot hope to stand up much longer against the troops outside the walls. His only friend is Hieronymus, the doomed scapegoat chosen by the priests of Artemis to bear the sins of the population and save them from annihilation. When Gordianus witnesses the fall of a young woman from a precipice called Sacrifice Rock, he becomes entangled in finding out what exactly happened - did she fall or was she pushed? - and where, in all of this, is the truth about his missing son.",

This was not the city of decadence, carnival, and nostalgia familiar to us from later centuries. It was a ruthless imperial city, with a shrewd commercial base, like ancient Athens, which it resembled in its combination of art and sea empire.  Venice: Lion City presents a new way of relating the history of the city through its art and, in turn, illuminates the art through the city's history. It is illustrated with more than 130 works of art, 30 in full color. Garry Wills gives us a unique view of Venice's rulers, merchants, clerics, laborers, its Jews, and its women as they created a city that is the greatest art museum in the world, a city whose allure remains undiminished after centuries.  Like Simon Schama's The Embarrassment of Riches, on the Dutch culture in the Golden Age, Venice: Lion City will take its place as a classic work of history and criticism.",

Here a boy of seventeen, yearning to prove he's a man, squares up against an outlaw...and discovers that what counts is not how fast you can draw a gun but how much faith you have in yourself. A veteran trail driver, who's faced lightning and hail, raiding Comanche and thundering stampedes, finds that there's nothing quite so dangerous as the courting of a beautiful womanHere, too, in stories told with L'Amour's patented poignancy and power, a homesteader fighting for his rights is brutally beaten and crawls off to die...only to stumble upon an ancient talisman that restores his faith and will to live. A preacher from a distant land rides into a small frontier town with a voice full of fire and a saddlebag full of miracles...to deliver a promise and a warning that lead the local folk to a most surprising revelation. And in the full-length novella \"Rustler Roundup\", the hardworking citizens of a law-abiding town are pushed to the edge to defend all they hold dear. As suspicion spreads and evidence mounts, the rumors of rustlers in their midst threaten to explode into a full-blown range warEach of these stories bears the master's touch--comic twists, stark realism, crackling suspense--all the elements that have made Louis L'Amour a frontier legend in his own right. In End of the Drive, L'Amour brilliantly illuminates the dramatic struggles and enduring truths, the self-reliance and self-determination that have long beat at the heart of America's greatness.",

He examines Guevara's complex relationship with Fidel Castro, and analyzes the flaws of character that compelled him to leave Cuba and expend his energies, and ultimately his life, in quixotic adventures in the Congo and Bolivia. A masterpiece of scholarship, Companero is the definitive portrait of a figure who continues to fascinate and inspire the world over.",

When John the Baptist said that he must decrease while Jesus must increase, he was expressing the secret to astonishing freedom\u2026and incredible rest.

The real story of life is God\u2014I AM\u2014the main character and true star of time and eternity. He is at center stage in all of Creation, and He wants you to know Him by name.

Savor the true meaning of life as you learn to work and rest in His power, spending your life for what lasts forever\u2014the unending glory that is God\u2019s alone.  Story Behind the BookLouie Giglio recognizes a world and culture that keeps pushing us to be bigger, to be known, to be on top, to be at the center of everything. He encourages those who know how to right-size it all. Instead of pumping up their own programs, agendas, ideas, and plans, their goal is to keep getting smaller in order for Jesus to get bigger. Regarding themselves in relation to Jesus, they have the same goal John the Baptist had: \u201cHe must increase, I must decrease.\u201d",
