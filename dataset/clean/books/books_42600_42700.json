Now they've written a book for teens based on the same formula: it includes the seven worst things even smart-and outwardly successful-teens do, and shows teens how they can change these behaviors and assure their success in life as they grow towards adulthood.This book was written expressly for teenagers as a unique roadmap into adulthood. It was designed to stimulate the brain as well as the heart because teenagers who listen to both can eventually negotiate adolescence successfully. It will appeal to teenagers who like to think, wonder, question and challenge, as well as to teenagers who feel that they haven't quite figured out this \"life\" thing.The Friels show teens the seven things they need to do in order to overcome common roadblocks they face or will face. These are:Become competent-don't expect to have self-esteem without becoming competentMaster your feelings-don't let your feelings run the showBreak the silence-don't silently scream instead of making yourself knownGet healthy power-don't avoid learning about powerFace the serious stuff-don't hide the really important things you're experiencingFind an identity-don't avoid the struggle to find yourselfLearn to stake out the extremes-don't live only in the extremes.Written in clear, straightforward language and including many interesting and colorful story interludes, this book is an easy-to-use, powerful tool for all teens.",

Inside you'll find people named Norman, Nicklaus, Pavin, Watson, Mickelson, and Daly.  But you'll also find deeply funny tales of terror on everything from Qualifying School to the Masters.  In all, Just a Range Ball... is a work of pure delight from Gary McCord, television's number one golf commentator and iconoclast.",

        "Authors": "By Taulbert, Clifton L.",
        "Description": "In his trilogy of memoirs that includes Once Upon A Time When We Were Colored, The Last Train North, and Watching Our Crops Come In, Clifton Taulbert introduced us to a host of relatives and friends--affectionately known as the porch people--who were an integral part of his upbringing in his native Glen Allan, Mississippi.  Although these people were limited in financial resources, they were rich in love and wisdom and taught him lessons that proved to be invaluable.  Using his own success as proof that by building strong communities, we build strong individuals, Taulbert revisits these elders and their lessons in Eight Habits of the Heart : Embracing the Values that Build Strong Families and Communities (Penguin Books; January 5, 1999; $9.95). Eight Habits of the Heart grew out of a commencement speech that Taulbert delivered in 1995 at the North Shore Country Day School in Winnetka, Illinois.  Wanting to leave a lasting impression on America's future leaders, but not knowing exactly what to say, Taulbert illustrated the community building practices that he learned from Poppa Joe, Ma Ponk, Preacher Hurn, and others in his beloved Mississippi Delta.  He realized that a lot of the good will that these people showed one another was habitual and was offered out of love and respect.  And that if we all practiced those same acts of kindness-- habits of the heart--in our day-to-day lives, not only would we build a strong community for ourselves and future generations, but we would have the potential to build a strong nation.With rich and poignant personal stories, Clifton Taulbert illustrates each habit and shows readers how to embrace these values:Nurturing Attitude:  \"Unselfish caring, supportiveness, and a willingness to share time\" despite hardships; the ability to give our children \"the best of what has been provided to us.\"Dependability: \"Being there for others through all the times of their lives, a steady influence that makes tomorrow a welcome event.\"Responsibility: \"Showing and encouraging a personal commitment to each task.\"Friendship: The ability to bind together and \"take pleasure in each other's company.\"  Listening, laughing, and sharing good times and bad.Brotherhood:  Reaching beyond comfortable relationships \"to extend a welcome to those who may be different from yourself.\"High Expectations:  \"Believing that others can be successful, telling them so, and praising their accomplishments.\"Courage:  \"Standing up and doing the right thing, speaking out on behalf of others, and making a commitment to excellence in the face of adversity or the absence of support.\"Hope:  \"Believing in tomorrow--because you have learned to see with your heart.\"Taulbert also includes a series of \"Exercises for Reflection\" that can be used by families, businesses, schools, worship groups, reading clubs, and others to help motivate the building of stronger relationships and communities.  His voice shines through as a refreshing guide to the spiritual core we as a society seem always to be seeking.",

        "Description": "The author of the groundbreaking bestseller takes his cutting-edge analysis to the next level.  In civilian and military circles alike, The Pentagon's New Map became one of the most talked-about books of the year. The Pentagon's New Map combined security, economic, political, and cultural factors to provide a fundamental reexamination of war and peace in the post-9/11 world, and a compelling vision of the future. Now, senior adviser and military analyst Barnett tells us how we get to that future. In a book at once pragmatic, thought-provoking, and optimistic, he explores both the long- and short-term pathways for governments, institutions, and individuals alike. Paying particular attention to such nations and regions as Iran, Iraq, and the Middle East, China, North Korea, Latin America, and Africa, he outlines the strategies to pursue, the entities to create, the pitfalls to overcome.  If the first book was a compelling framework for confronting twenty-first-century problems, the new book is something more-a powerful road map through a chaotic and uncertain world to \"a future worth creating.\"",

        "Description": "HTML is changing so fast it's almost impossible to keep up with  developments.  XHTML is HTML 4.0 rewritten in XML; it provides the precision of XML while retaining the flexibility of HTML. HTML & XHTML: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition, brings it all together. It's the most comprehensive book available on HTML and XHTML today. It covers Netscape Navigator 6.0, Internet Explorer 5.0, HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, JavaScript, Style sheets, Layers, and all of the features supported by the popular web browsers.Learning HTML and XHTML is like learning any new language, computer or human. Most students first immerse themselves in examples. Studying others is a natural way to learn, making learning easy and fun.  Imitation can take learning only so far, though. It's as easy to learn bad habits through imitation as it is to acquire good ones. The better way to become HTML-fluent is through a comprehensive reference that covers the language syntax, semantics, and variations in detail and demonstrates the difference between good and bad usage.HTML & XHTML: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition, helps in both ways: the authors cover every element of HTML/XHTML in detail, explaining how each element works and how it interacts with other elements. Many hints about HTML/XHTML style smooth the way for writing documents that range from simple online documentation to complex presentations. With hundreds of examples, the book gives web authors models for writing their own effective web pages and for mastering advanced features, like style sheets and frames.HTML & XHTML: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition, shows how to:Implement the XHTML 1.0 standard and prepare web pages for the transition to XML browsersUse style sheets and layers to control a document's appearanceCreate tables, from simple to complexUse frames to coordinate sets of documentsDesign and build interactive forms and dynamic documentsInsert images, sound files, video, Java applets, and JavaScript programsCreate documents that look good on a variety of browsersThe book comes with a handy quick reference card listing HTML tags.",

Murder at the Opera features the popular crime-fighting couple Mac Smith and his wife, Annabel Reed-Smith, as they navigate the glitz, glamour, and grime that is Washington, D.C.It ain\u2019t over till the fat lady sings . . . but the show hasn\u2019t even started yet when a diva is found dead. The soprano in question, a petite young Asian Canadian named Charise Lee, was scarcely a star at the Washington National Opera. But when the aspiring singer is stabbed in the heart backstage during rehearsals, she suddenly takes center stage.Georgetown law professor Mac Smith thought he\u2019d just be carrying a rapier in Tosca as a favor for his beloved Annabel, but now they\u2019re both being pressured by the panicked theater board to unmask a killer. Providing accompaniment will be former homicide detective, current P.I., and eternal opera fan Raymond Pawkins.Soon the Smiths find themselves dangerously improvising among an expanding cast of suspects with all sorts of scores to settle. What they uncover is an increasingly complex case reaching far beyond Washington to a dark world of informers and terror alerts in Iraq, and climaxing on a fateful night at the opera attended by none other than the President himself.",

A termite jumps up on the bar and asks, \u201cWhere is the bar tender?\u201d Drum roll. The Fifth Edition of the perennially popular Pretty Good Joke Book is everything the first four were and more. More puns, one-liners, light bulb jokes, knock-knock jokes, and third-grader jokes (have you heard the one about Elvis Parsley?). More religion jokes, political jokes, lawyer jokes, blonde jokes, and jokes in questionable taste (Why did the urologist lose his license? He got in trouble with his peers). More jokes about chickens, relationships, and senior moments (The nice thing about Alzheimer\u2019s is you can enjoy the same jokes again and again). It all started back in 1996, when A Prairie Home Companion fans laughed themselves silly during the first Joke Show. The broadcast was such a hit that it became an almost-annual gagfest. Then fans wanted to read the jokes, share them, and pass them around, and the first Pretty Good Joke Book was born. With 362 new jokes (more or less), the latest edition promises countless giggles, chortles, and guffaws anyone?fans of the radio show or not?will enjoy.",
