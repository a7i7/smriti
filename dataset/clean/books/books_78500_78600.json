        "Authors": "By Rosenblatt, Bill",
        "Description": "This Nutshell Handbook\u00ae is a thorough introduction to the Korn shell, both as a user interface and as a programming language.The Korn shell, like the C and Bourne shells, is a program that interprets UNIX commands. It has many features that aren't found in other shells, including command history (the ability to recall and edit previous commands). The Korn shell is also faster; several of its features allow you to write programs that execute more quickly than their Bourne or C shell equivalents.This book provides a clear and concise explanation of the Korn shell's features. It explains ksh string operations, co-processes, signals and signal handling, and one of the worst \"dark corners\" of shell programming: command-line interpretation. It does this by introducing simple real-life examples and then adding options and complexity in later chapters,  illustrating the way real-world script development generally proceeds. An  additional (and unique) programming aid, a Korn shell debugger (kshdb), is  also included.Learning the Korn Shell is an ideal resource for many UNIX users and programmers, including software developers who want to \"prototype\" their designs, system administrators who want to write tools for their own use, and even novices who just want to use some of ksh's more advanced interactive features.",

Acclaimed military historian Bevin Alexander\u2019s incisive and vivid analyses of famous battles throughout the ages show how the greatest commanders\u2014from Alexander the Great to Douglas MacArthur\u2014have applied these rules. For example:\u2022 Feign retreat: Pretend defeat, fake a retreat, then ambush the enemy while being pursued. Used to         devastating effect by the North Vietnamese against U.S. forces during the Vietnam War. \u2022 Strike at enemy weakness: Avoid the enemy\u2019s strength entirely by refusing to fight pitched battles, a method that has run alongside conventional war from the earliest days of human conflict. Brilliantly applied by Mao Zedong to defeat the Chinese Nationalists.\u2022 Defend, then attack: Gain possession of a superior weapon or tactical system, induce the enemy to launch a fruitless attack, then go on the offensive. Employed repeatedly against the Goths by the Eastern Roman general Belisarius to reclaim vast stretches of the Roman Empire. The lessons of history revealed in these pages can be used to shape the strategies needed to win the conflicts of today.",

        "Description": "You can't lead others until you lead yourself. If you can't lead yourself, you won't be effective at leading others. Self leadership precedes strategic leadership. Our culture constantly shows how leaders have failed-from Bill Clinton's indiscretion to Martha Stewart's\u00a0deception, from the business collapse at Enron to the military meltdown at Abu Ghraib prison. Many church problems likewise can be traced back to a failure of leadership. Such problems are nothing new. Stories of leadership failures are chronicled throughout the Bible.\"If you can't lead yourself, you won't be effective at leading others. Self leadership precedes strategic leadership.\" With this perspective, Michael Slaughter, lead pastor and chief visionary at Ginghamsburg United Methodist Church (www.ginghamsburg.org), explains his model for daily living, which he has adapted from the Psalms of Ascent. His five life practices for balance and self-leadership together form the acronym D-R-I-V-E: Devotion to God, Readiness for lifelong learning, Investing in key relationships, Visioning for the future, and Eating and Exercise for life. Taken together, they shape life as an upward momentum. They remind you that leadership is not about entitlement, but example. Every follower of Christ needs to find the self-management practices that create momentum for life and guard against the temptation to downsize God's dream. \"God can't steer a parked car,\" Slaughter says. \"God is looking for people who will take their lives out of park and shift them into drive.\" These leadership tools will inspire and show you how to sustain personal health, integrity, and strategic focus as a leader.Click for Sample Chapter.",

Years later, Danny doesn't think about his past. He's built a new world for himself: a legitimate career, a long-term girlfriend, and a clean conscience. He's just like anyone else. Normal.

For one year, author and journalist Meredith Maran reported on the lives of three different but representative students from the Class of 2000: a troubled yet well-meaning young white man from an affluent family, a highly gifted and academically overachieving young woman from a biracial background, and a functionally illiterate African American young man who excels at football. In telling their stories, and in fully depicting their turbulent year as seniors\u2014a year that saw arson, corruption, professional ineptitude, and dismal teacher morale\u2014this book offers a fascinating, up-to-the-minute account of the socio-economic and racial realities in our public schools. Maran's eye-opening inquiry also shows how even a progressively multi-racial educational institution like Berkeley High can operate not as one school with a common objective but as several different schools under one roof, where students' opportunities and options are as limited as they are varied. Revealing as much about our society as it does about our teenagers, Class Dismissed is a must-read for everyone interested in the possibilities and truths behind American public education today.",

Recent high-profile bailouts show the walls between government and the private sector are getting thinner each day. Federal control now extends in various ways to education, healthcare, financial markets, real estate, businesses, and religion. And as out-of-control government spending and debt increase accordingly, America is drained of the economic and political strength its people fought and worked so hard to achieve. But it isn\u2019t too late to save the land of the free.Saving Freedom is Senator Jim DeMint\u2019s firsthand account of the unsettling socialist shift\u2014behind-the-scenes actions in Congress that are changing the character of our nation. He illuminates key principles of freedom and how they are being compromised by big government. More important, DeMint lays out a complete action plan to reclaim America\u2019s freedom based on legislation that would reduce debt, fix Social Security, and provide a tax credit for every family to buy health insurance. The plan also emphasizes reversing America\u2019s cultural decline by restoring a strong spirit of God and country.Endorsements:Saving Freedom is a new Declaration of Independence, a call for the American people to reclaim America.

        "Title": "Shadowbrook: A Novel of Love, War, and the Birth of America",
        "Authors": "By Swerling, Beverly",
        "Description": "The Los Angeles Times called Beverly Swerling's City of Dreams \"a near-perfect historical novel.\" Now, in Shadowbrook, set against the backdrop of the famously bloody French and Indian War, Swerling once again tells a gripping, multilayered story of colonial America that will captivate both new readers and admirers of her critically acclaimed earlier novel.1754. In a low-lying glen in the Ohio Country, where both the French and the English claim dominion, the first musket ball fired signals the start of the savage seven-year conflict destined to dismantle France's overreaching empire and pave the way for the American Revolution. It is here that Swerling introduces a cast of unforgettable characters: Quentin Hale, the fearless gentleman-turned-scout the Indians call Red Bear; Cormac Shea, the part-Irish, part-Indian woodsman with a foot in both worlds, sworn to drive every white man from Canada; and the beautiful Nicole Crane, who, struggling to reconcile her love for Hale and her calling to the convent, becomes a pawn in the British quest for territory.Quentin and Cormac were raised as brothers on Shadowbrook, a prosperous plantation in the northern wilderness whose fertile land, worked by slaves, sits between Hudson's River and the Adirondack Mountains. Though fiercely devoted to each other, they often find themselves on opposite sides of a fight, but not in this war, or in the struggle to wrest control of Shadowbrook from Quentin's depraved older brother.From Iroquois longhouses to the elegant rooms of Shadowbrook, from the virgin forests of the frontier to the cobbled streets of Qu\u00e9bec, Swerling weaves a tale of passion and intrigue, faith and devotion, courage and betrayal.Peopled by historical figures including a young George Washington, the fabled Ottawa chief Pontiac, and the legendary generals Wolfe and Montcalm, this richly textured novel vividly captures the conflict that ignited the eighteenth century and presaged our nation's quest for independence. But it is through Swerling's powerfully drawn characters -- the ordinary men and women living in a world on the brink of astonishing change -- that this novel comes searingly alive. A classic in the making, Shadowbrook is a page-turning tale of ambition, war, and the transforming power of both love and duty.",

Greeley's bestselling tales of Nuala Anne McGrail, a fey, Irish-speaking woman from Galway blessed with the gift of second sight and a knack for unraveling mysteries, and her hapless husband and accomplice, Dermot Michael Coyne. From Irish Gold through Irish Stew! this spirited couple has untangled many a knotty mystery, both at home in Chicago and back in Erin. Now they return in another captivating blend of romance, humor, and intrigueDamian \"Day\" O'Sullivan is a troubled young man who blames himself for a tragic vehicular homicide he may not have committed. Trouble is, Day's entire family seems to be conspiring to pin the crime on the poor lad, which only leads Nuala and Dermot to wonder who really ran over (three times!) Rodney Keefe in the parking lot of a ritzy Chicago country club.The O'Sullivans are a ruthlessly ambitious clan of South Side Irish, who consider themselves the cream of the Irish-American community. The sensitive Day has always been something of a black sheep in the family---and perhaps a scapegoat as well.But the twisted saga of the O'Sullivans isn't the only mystery to be unraveled. Having stumbled onto the diary of Father Richard Lonigan, a nineteenth-century parish priest assigned to a remote village in old Donegal, Dermot and Nuala find themselves caught up in the closely guarded secrets and scandals of that desolate time and place, where simmering resentment against the ruling English sometimes erupted into violence and murder....Irish Cream is another rich and satisfying concoction by one of America's most popular storytellers.",

Elizabeth Gilbert tells how she made the difficult choice to leave behind all the trappings of modern American success (marriage, house in the country, career) and find, instead, what she truly wanted from life. Setting out for a year to study three different aspects of her nature amid three different cultures, Gilbert explored the art of pleasure in Italy and the art of devotion in India, and then a balance between the two on the Indonesian island of Bali. By turns rapturous and rueful, this wise and funny author (whom Booklist calls \u201cAnne Lamott\u2019s hip, yoga- practicing, footloose younger sister\u201d) is poised to garner yet more adoring fans.",

        "Description": "(WASHINGTON, D.C.) On May 20, 2010, Laura Ingraham received a package from an anonymous source that will change the history of the United States and the legacy of President Barack Obama. While retrieving her automobile from the underground garage at the Watergate complex (where she had just enjoyed her weekly pedicure), Ingraham discovered a manila envelope on the hood of her car. When she picked it up, a deep baritone voice called out from a nearby stairwell: \"Just read it. You\u2019ll know what to do.\" The shadowy figure then disappeared into the darkness without another word. The envelope contained copies of what appeared to be diary entries written by President Barack Obama, his family, and high-ranking administration officials. Because the \"diaries\" are so revealing, Ingraham felt compelled to release them to the American public and the citizens of the world. Major media outlets love to describe the president as \"no drama Obama,\" but The Obama Diaries tells a different tale. Through these \"diary entries,\" readers will see past the carefully constructed Obama fa\u00e7ade to the administration\u2019s true plans to \"remake America.\" In The Obama Diaries, Ingraham hilariously skewers the president and his minions. She takes aim at: \u2022the cynical \"razzle-dazzle\" marketing of Obama\u2019s radical agenda \u2022the use of the Obama \"brand\" and family to obscure Obama\u2019s true aims \u2022Michelle Obama\u2019s gardening and anti-obesity initiative; and much more. Informative and hugely entertaining, The Obama Diaries will inspire both laughter and critical thinking about the future of the nation and the man currently at the helm. Excerpts from Laura Ingraham\u2019s The Obama Diaries Obama on Sarah Palin:\"Hell, doesn\u2019t Palin have anything better to do than criticize me? Shouldn\u2019t she be back home shooting some endangered wolf species from a helicopter?\" (April 9, 2010)Michelle on being First Lady: \"I\u2019ll be damned if all this fabulosity is going to go to waste reading Dr. Seuss to snot-nosed kids all day.\" (January 23, 2009)Vice President Joe Biden on Michelle Obama: \"She\u2019s kind of like a black Hillary Clinton. I mean that in a good way.\"\u00a0 (May 5, 2009)Obama on his visit to the Vatican:\"If I can ingratiate myself with a few more of these red-hats, the pope thing might not be a bad follow-up to the presidency.\"\u00a0 (July 10, 2009)",

William Powers, brave in intent and wise in argument, offers in these pages an oasis of serenity and sanity, a sanctuary from a world fast turning into a limitless digital Sahara.---Simon Winchester, Author of the Professor and the Madman and the Man Who Loved China\"\"Always connected. Anytime. Anyplace. We know it's a blessing, but we're starting to notice that it's also a curse. In Hamlet's BlackBerry, William Powers helps us understand what being `connected' disconnects us from. This is a thoughtful, elegant, and moving book.\"---Barry Schwartz, Author of the Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less\"A brilliant and thoughtful handbook for the Internet age---why we have this screen addiction, its many perils, and some surprising remedies that can make your life better.\"---Bob Woodward\"Benjamin Franklin would love this book. He knew the power of being connected, but also how this must be balanced by moments of reflection. William Powers offers a practical guide to Socrates' path to the good life, in which our outward and inward selves are at one.\"---Walter Isaacson, Author of Einstein: His Life and Universe and Benjamin Franklin An American Life\"In this delightfully accessible book, Powers asks the questions we all need to ask in this digitally driven time---and teaches us to answer them for ourselves.\"---Maryanne Wolf, Author of Proust and the Souid: The Story and Science of the Reading BrainA crisp, passionately argued answer to the question that everyone who's grown dependent on digital devices is asking: \"Where's the rest of my life?\"At a time when we're all trying to make sense of our relentlessly connected lives, this revelatory book presents a bold new approach to the digital age. Part intellectual journey, part memoir, Hamlet's BlackBerry sets out to solve what William Powers calls the conundrum of connectedness. Our computers and mobile devices do wonderful things for us. But they also impose an enormous burden, making it harder for us to focus, do our best work, build strong relationships, and find the depth and fulfillment we crave.Hamlet's BlackBerry argues that we need a new way of thinking, an everyday philosophy for life with screens. To find it, Powers reaches into the past, uncovering a rich trove of ideas that have helped people manage and enjoy their connected lives for thousands of years. New technologies have always brought the mix of excitement and stress that we feel today. Drawing on some of history's most brilliant thinkers, from Plato to Shakespeare to Thoreau, he shows that digital connectedness serves us best when it's balanced by its opposite, disconnectedness.Using his own life as laboratory and object lesson, Powers demonstrates why this is the moment to revisit our relationship to screens and mobile technologies, and how profound the rewards of doing so can be. Lively, original, and entertaining, Hamlet's BlackBerry will challenge you to rethink your digital life.",
