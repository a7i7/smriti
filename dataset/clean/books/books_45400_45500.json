Steele has been nominated for an Academy Award, but his most compelling performance has just begun. He has been cast unaware as the lead character in a supernatural drama between good and evil, heaven and hell. Claiming that the Sermon on the Mount is an impossible standard, Satan has chosen Steele to prove his point in a wager with God. God agrees to the choice, insisting that Michael can live out the truths of Matthew 5, 6, and 7 in the ten days before the award ceremonies.The Wager follows Steele as he copes with his career, his crumbling marriage, and his struggles with his faith---not to mention a few diabolical tricks and temptations by Satan and some guidance and encouragement from heaven. All this as Steele probes the depth of the Sermon on the Mount and how one man might follow it.Part fiction, part Bible study, The Wager is a powerful parable examining the Sermon on the Mount and how to live it in today's world.",

        "Title": "Differentiate or Die: Survival in Our Era of Killer Competition",
        "Authors": "By Trout, Jack and Rivkin, Steve",
        "Description": "\"Any damn fool can put on a deal, but it takes genius, faith, and perseverance to create a brand.\"-David Ogilvy  In today's ultra-competitive world, the average supermarket has 40,000 brand items on its shelves. Car shoppers can wander through the showrooms of over twenty automobile makers. For marketers, differentiating products today is more challenging than at any time in history yet it remains at the heart of successful marketing. More importantly, it remains the key to a company's survival.  In Differentiate or Die, bestselling author Jack Trout doesn't beat around the bush. He takes marketers to task for taking the easy route too often, employing high-tech razzle-dazzle and sleight of hand when they should be working to discover and market their product's uniquely valuable qualities. He examines successful differentiation initiatives from giants like Dell Computer, Southwest Airlines, and Wal-Mart to smaller success stories like Streit's Matzoh and Connecticut's tiny Trinity College to determine why some marketers succeed at differentiating themselves while others struggle and fail.  More than just a collection of marketing success stories, however, Differentiate or Die is an in-depth exploration of today's most successful differentiation strategies. It explains what these strategies are, where and when they should be applied, and how they can help you carve out your own image in a crowded marketplace. Marketing executives in all types of organizations, regardless of size, can learn how to achieve product differentiation through strategies including: * Revisiting the U.S.P. Rosser Reeves's classic unique selling proposition approach, updated for today's marketplace * Positioning Understanding how the mind works in the differentiating process * Owning an Idea Techniques to seize a differentiating idea, dramatize it, and make it your own * Competition How to use differentiating ideas against your competitors in the marketplace  Consumers today are faced with an explosion of choices. In this environment, distinctive product attributes are quickly copied by competitors, perceived by consumers to be minimal, or both. Still, those who fail to differentiate their product or service in the mind of the consumer won't stand a chance.  Differentiate or Die outlines the many ways you can achieve differentiation. It also warns how difficult it is to achieve differentiation by being creative, cheap, customer oriented, or quality driven things that your competitors can do as well.  Praise for Differentiate or Die  \"Another great book by the king of positioning!\"-John Schnatter, CEO, Papa John's International  \"Differentiate or Die differentiates itself on the groaning marketing bookshelf with its lucid prose, its clear vision of the future marketplace . . . and its sensible solutions for surviving the frenzied competition we're sure to find there.\"-Dan Rather, CBS News  \"What I like about Differentiate or Die is the book's emphasis on the power of logic, simplicity, and clarity-getting to the essence of a problem. In Silicon Valley, attributes like that can make the difference between having lunch and being lunch.\"-Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems, Inc.  \"Trout and Rivkin marvelously illustrate that differentiation is the cornerstone of successful marketing.\" -Philip Kotler, S.C. Johnson Distinguished Professor of International Marketing, Kellogg Graduate School of Management, Northwestern University  \"We've built our business by being first-and executing best. Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin are doing the same, delivering the timely, powerful insights that will drive tomorrow's marketing strategies. A must read for anyone looking to win in an unforgiving competitive marketplace.\"-Mike Ruettgers, CEO, EMC Corporation  \"Dotcom executives must learn the lessons of Differentiate or Die. If they don't, I pity their investors.\"-Aaron Cohen, CEO, Concrete Media; Co-Founder, Bolt.com",

They've come at the invitation of their widowed aunt, whose estate, the Domaine de la Cade, is famous in the region. But their aunt, and the Domaine, are not what Leonie had imagined. Aunt Isolde is young, willowy, and beautiful, yet with a melancholy air that suits the slightly sinister Domaine. Leonie discovers that the isolated country house and its ancient forests have long been the subject of local superstition; when she stumbles across a ruined Visigoth sepulchre, she unwittingly involves herself with the timeless mystery of this eerie place, which may be spelled out in a strange pack of tarot cards that is rumored to hold the power of life and death. While Leonie delves deeper into the secrets of the Domaine, a different evil stalks her family - one that may explain why Leonie and Anatole were invited to Rennes-lesBains in the first place.October 2007: More than a century later, Meredith Martin, an American graduate student, arrives in Rennes-les-Bains, She checks into a grand old hotel - the Domaine de la Cade - and almost instantly, strange dreams and visions begin to haunt her waking hours. A chance encounter leads her to a pack of tarot cards painted by Leonie Vernier, which may hold the key to this twenty-first-century American's fate ... and explain the ties that bind the two women together.As the Feast of All Saints approaches - when the veil between life and death is thinnest - Meredith is drawn inexorably to a secluded forest glade where the secrets of the past are far from buried.",

On the streets of Hell's Kitchen, the construction rackets are in the hands of the Irish mob. It's always been their turf; now it's their time. And the stakes are higher than ever before - which explains the sudden interest in the Irish on the part of both the Mafia and the feds (led by a female agent trapped by the necessity to prove what she is clearly capable of), and the growing struggle for position and profit within the mob itself, an internecine war that finally ignites in the back rooms and broad daylight of the neighborhood.At the heart of the story are the Adare brothers: Paddy, a failed boxer turned mob henchman who's never left the streets he grew up on and who, at thirty-two, is beginning to pay the price for years of living large; and Billy, a college graduate, back home for the summer to work in the tunnels as a sandhog before he enters law school and gets himself out of the old neighborhood and in on the American dream - brothers divided by everything but their powerful blood-tie. Now, as their paths converge on familiar streets in a cross fire of greed, treachery, and violence, their loyalties - to family, friends, neighborhood, and, most important, each other - will be put to a brutal and profoundly telling test.",

Instead he gets himself arrested while camping with his wife and kids, takes a two month leave of absence from his PR job, and retreats to his farmhouse in rural Preston Falls--where he plugs in his guitar and tries to shut out his life.While his wife, Jean, struggles to pay the bills and raise their sullen, skeptical kids, Willis's plans for hiatus crumble into Dewars-and-cocaine fueled disarray. A shattered window, an unguarded gun, and a shady small town attorney force a crisis--and Willis can't go home again. With its biting humor and harsh realism, Preston Falls confirms David Gates as a talent in the tradition of Russell Banks and Richard Ford: a master of dark truths and private longings.",

A group of English Catholics, seeking to unseat the king and reintroduce Catholicism as the state religion, daringly placed in position thirty-six barrels of gunpowder in a cellar under the Palace of Westminster. Their aim was to ignite the gunpowder at the opening of the parliamentary session. Though the charismatic Catholic Robert Catesby was the group's leader, it was the devout Guy Fawkes who emerged as its most famous member, as he was the one who was captured and who revealed under torture the names of his fellow plotters. In the aftermath of their arrests, conditions grew worse for English Catholics, as legal penalties against them were stiffened and public sentiment became rabidly intolerant.In a narrative that reads like a gripping detective story. Antonia Fraser has untangled the web of religion, politics, and personalities that surrounded that fateful night of November 5. And in examining the lengths to which individuals will go for their faith, she finds in this long-ago event a reflection of the religion-inspired terrorism that has produced gunpowder plots of our own time.",

What she doesn't know is that this same spirit appeared to leaders of the Jumano Native American tribe in New Mexico 362 years earlier, and was linked to a Spanish nun capable of powers of \"bilocation,\" or the ability to be in two places simultaneously. Meanwhile, young journalist Carlos Albert is driven by a blinding snowstorm to the little Spanish town of \u00c1greda, where he stumbles upon a nearly forgotten seventeenth-century convent founded by this same legendary woman. Intrigued by her rumored powers, he delves into finding out more. These threads, linked by an apparent suicide, eventually lead Carlos to Cardinal Baldi, to an American spy, and ultimately to Los Angeles, where Jennifer Narody unwittingly holds the key to the mystery that the Catholic Church, the U.S. Defense Department, and the journalist are each determined to decipher -- the Lady in Blue.",

        "Authors": "By Postrel, Virginia",
        "Description": "From airport terminals decorated like Starbucks to the popularity of hair dye among teenage boys, one thing is clear: we have entered the Age of Aesthetics. Sensory appeals are everywhere, and they are intensifying, radically changing how Americans live and work. We expect every strip mall and city block to offer designer coffee, a copy shop with do-it-yourself graphics workstations, and a nail salon for manicures on demand. Every startup, product, or public space calls for an aesthetic touch, which gives us more choices, and more responsibility. By now, we all rely on style to express identity. And aesthetics has become too important to be left to the aesthetes.In this penetrating, keenly observed book, Virginia Postrel shows that the \"look and feel\" of people, places, and things are more important than we think. Aesthetic pleasure taps deep human instincts and is essential for creativity and growth. Drawing from fields as diverse as fashion, real estate, politics, design, and economics, Postrel deftly chronicles our culture\u2019s aesthetic imperative and argues persuasively that it is a vital component of a healthy, forward-looking society. Intelligent, incisive, and thought provoking, The Substance of Style is a groundbreaking portrait of the democratization of taste and a brilliant examination of the way we live now.",

        "Description": "The economist most renowned for predicting the New Economy of the 1990s now returns-just as books like The Long Boom and Dow 36,000 are turning the idea of perpetual prosperity into conventional wisdom-to say that the dominating economic event of the next few years is likely to be a deep recession, perhaps even a depression. Michael J. Mandel begins The Coming Internet Depression by explaining why just such a depression is not only possible but increasingly likely. His explanation is based in a comparison of the present period with the 1920s: both saw tremendous growth in GDP that was largely centered on the \"hypergrowth\" of a single industry-automobiles in the 1920s, information technology today. When this \"hypergrowth\" reverts to a normal growth pattern, as the automobile industry did in 1929, the resulting overcapacity will slow down the entire economy. Mandel addresses three key questions: When will the Internet Depression start? How will we know when it's coming? How bad will it be? Finally, he shows how investors, workers, and businesses can navigate the bad times safely and prosper in the long recovery that will follow.",

        "Description": "Introduced by Francis Fergusson, the Poetics, written in the fourth century B.C., is still an essential study of the art of drama, indeed the most fundamental one we have. It has been used by both playwrights and theorists of many periods, and interpreted, in the course of its two thousand years of life, in various ways. The literature which has accumulated around it is, as Mr. Fergusson points out, \"full of disputes so erudite that the nonspecialist can only look on in respectful silence.\" But thePoetics itself is still with us, in all its suggestiveness, for the modern reader to make use of in his turn and for his own purposes.Francis Fergusson's lucid, informative, and entertaining Introduction will prove invaluable to anyone who wishes to understand and appreciate the Poetics. Using Sophocles'Oedipus Rex, as Aristotle did, to illustrate his analysis, Mr. Fergusson pints out that Aristotle did not lay down strict rules, as is often thought: \"ThePoetics,\" he says, \"is much more like a cookbook than it is like a textbook of elementary engineering.\" Read in this way, it is an essential guide not only to Sophoclean tragedy, but to the work of so modern a playwright as Bertolt Brecht, who considered his own \"epic drama\" the first non-Aristotelian form.",

He buys the work; tracks down the artist, Bill Wechsler; and the two men embark on a life-long friendship. Leo's story, which spans twenty-five years, follows the growing involvement between his family and Bill's--an intricate constellation of attachments that includes the two men, their wives, Erica and Violet, and their sons, Matthew and Mark.The families live in the same New York apartment building, rent a house together in the summers and keep up a lively exchange of ideas about life and art, but the bonds between them are tested, first by sudden tragedy, and then by a monstrous duplicity that slowly comes to the surface. A beautifully written novel that combines the intimacy of a family saga with the suspense of a thriller, What I Loved is a deeply moving story about art, love, loss, and betrayal.",

The clan from For Better or For Worse is not only recognized, their lives are studied, identified with, and, most of all, treasured for the amusing reflections they provide.\u2003\u2003Perhaps it's seeing part of ourselves in this familial five\u2014something that makes them so endearing. Maybe it's the good old-fashioned values they display. No matter what her secret, creator Lynn Johnston excels, once again, with this collection, Love Just Screws Everything Up, that gives us a chance to grow even closer to the Pattersons and their devoted dog, Edgar.\u2003\u2003This collection of heartwarming and humorous vignettes traces the Pattersons as they toil and traipse through their daily existence\u2014lives much like our own, amplified by Johnson's insightful take on the extraordinarily funny things that happen to ordinary people. For example, we watch as Elly, seemingly stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, uses her cell-phone to call the office\u2014while actually waiting to give her drive-up donut order. Or there's John scolding his girls during a fishing trip for wasting the live bait, only to have a gull grab his next cast in mid-air.\u2003\u2003No matter what their situation, no matter what their challenges, the Pattersons always come through with smiles\u2014at least on their readers' faces. This creative collection, Love Just Screws Everything Up, is sure to captivate all fans of cartooning's first family.",

        "Description": "'The comics pages have no shortage of family strips, but For Better or For Worse distinguished itself from the start. . . . This success can be attributed to Johnston's uncanny ability to see into the heart of daily life so accurately that readers feel she is speaking directly to them.\"Art imitating life. That's what happens in Lynn Johnston's perennially popular comic strip,For Better or For Worse. By reflecting on her own family and experiences, she created the Pattersons: Elly, John, Michael, Elizabeth, and April, along with grandparents, grandchildren, friends, and coworkers and the everyday situations they deal with.In Never Wink at a Worried Woman, life is progressing for each character. Elly and John tenuously think of retirement while still being preoccupied parents of a preteen. Michael and Deanna grow into their roles as new parents while Michael's career gets a new boost. Elizabeth takes more steps to adulthood, by beginning her student teaching and facing the fact that Anthony is marrying another. April is racing to turn 13, busy with her band and also helping out at Lilliput's, where she makes a painful discovery about a coworker. Add in Grampa Jim's quest to maintain his aging dignity and baby Meredith's burgeoning curiosity, and you get a full dose of life.For Better or For Worse has appealed to readers for more than 25 years. It runs in more than 2,000 newspapers in the U.S., Canada, and 20 other countries and is translated into eight languages besides English.",
