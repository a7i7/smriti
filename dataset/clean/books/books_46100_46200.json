But at the same time she is haunted--quite literally--by the memory of her friend Phillip, killed the previous year in a mountaineering accident.Kiki has never met her grandmother Yukiko, for whom she is named. Still, thoroughly American though she is, she feels a secret kinship with her. Kiki is swept up by the story of this strong, proud, passionate woman who, against all odds, in a time and place far different from her own, was sold by her impoverished family, became a famous geisha, and found the love that has so far eluded the rest of the Takehashi women.Lyrical, haunting, and stunningly evocative, One Hundred and One Ways introduces a powerful and exciting new voice in contemporary fiction.",

        "Description": "Simon Winchester, New York Times bestselling author of The Professor and the Madman, examines the legendary annihilation in 1883 of the volcano-island of Krakatoa, which was followed by an immense tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in Bogot\u00e1 and Washington, D.C., went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island&#39;s destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away. Most significant of all -- in view of today&#39;s new political climate -- the eruption helped to trigger in Java a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims, one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere. Krakatoa gives us an entirely new perspective on this fascinating and iconic event.This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",

Even today in our technologically advanced age, more than seventy percent of Americans claim to believe in God. Why, in short, won\u2019t God go away? In this groundbreaking new book, researchers Andrew Newberg and Eugene d\u2019Aquili offer an explanation that is at once profoundly simple and scientifically precise: The religious impulse is rooted in the biology of the brain.In Why God Won\u2019t Go Away, Newberg and d\u2019Aquili document their pioneering explorations in the field of neurotheology, an emerging discipline dedicated to understanding the complex relationship between spirituality and the brain. Blending cutting-edge science with illuminating insights into the nature of consciousness and spirituality, they bridge faith and reason, mysticism and empirical data. The neurological basis of how the brain identifies the \u201creal\u201d is nothing short of miraculous. This fascinating, eye-opening book dares to explore both the miracle and the biology of our enduring relationship with God.",

Alice Verney is a young woman intent on achieving her dreams. Returning to   England after a messy scandal forced her to flee to Louis XIV\u2019s France, Alice is anxious to   re-establish herself by regaining her former position as a maid   of honor to Charles II\u2019s queen and marrying the most celebrated duke of the   Restoration.  But all is not as it seems in the rowdy, merry court of Charles II. Since the Restoration,   old political alliances have frayed, and there are whispers that the king is moving   to divorce his barren queen, who some wouldn\u2019t mind seeing dead. Alice, loyal   only to a select few, is devoted to the queen, and so sets out to discover who might   be making sinister plans\u2014and if her own father is one of them. When a member of   the royal family dies unexpectedly, the stakes are raised.

        "Title": "Home on the Range",
        "Authors": "By Dickenson, James R.",
        "Description": "Home on the Range chronicles the epic drama of the settling and development of the High plains - a lyrical, nostalgic look at our rural past and its endangered future.The High Plains of the United States, where the buffalo once roamed, are being abandoned by many who once lived there, and, as a result, a culture and a way of life are being lost. Silhouetted against the violent dust storms and blizzards that often boil across the vast horizon, grain elevators, water towers, church steeples, and stark, tiny towns look as though they could be swallowed up without a trace. But, James R. Dickenson points out, the poignant irony is that these farms and towns are disappearing not through the ferocity of Mother Nature but due to the progression of technology and changes in life-styles. The railroad, the six-shooter, and barbed wire made the settlement and growth of this region possible, but technological advancements such as irrigation and computerized equipment are having a different effect.Home on the Range examines the past hundred years of life on the High Plains through the prism of the author's own hometown. The history of McDonald, Kansas (population now 200), is the story of hundreds of other Western towns. It's a moving and exciting portrait - including shootouts over land rights, lynchings, the chicanery of land agents, the adventures of bootleggers (Kansas was a dry state until 1948) - but also one of faith and community, with life revolving around the local school and church and the cycle of the harvest.The High Plains residents of today, Dickenson reminds us, are in the same position as their great-grandparents - on the verge of a great change. The question is whether the people of this area, who are on a social and economic rather than a physical frontier, can meet the challenge and create a viable society as their forbears did a century ago when they pioneered the vast untracked area once known as the Great American Desert.",

        "Description": "A novel that resonates with the bitter glory and deep human shame of the Confederacy. Against the epic canvas of the Civil War, the people, black and white, of one Virginia plantation fulfill their unforgettable destinies. Duncan Gatewood, seventeen and heir to Gatewood Plantation, falls in love with Maggie, a mulatto slave, who conceives a son, Jacob. Maggie and Jacob are sold south, and Duncan is packed off by his irate father to the Virginia Military Institute. As a cadet, Duncan guards the gallows of John Brown; as a man he will fight for Robert E. Lee. Another Gatewood slave, Jesse--whose love for Maggie is unrequited--escapes to find her and is sheltered by a young white couple who are sentenced to prison for this crime. Jesse finds his freedom and enlists in Mr. Lincoln's army; in time he will confront his former masters. From the interlocked lives of masters and slaves, and from a wealth of carefully researched yet unobtrusive historical detail, Donald McCaig conjures a passionate and richly textured story in the heart of America's greatest war. The loves, letters, and struggles of the characters connect a Vicksburg brothel to a Richmond salon, the riches of a sleek blockade runner with scenes of dire poverty, and the nightmare of a confederate hospital to the lurid hell of the battlefields at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. The Civil War is the wellspring of much of our most notable literature, and from this rich, poignant material McCaig has fashioned an unusual and powerful tale, a Confederate masterpiece.",

        "Description": "When John Brockman\u2019s essay, \u201cThe New Humanists\u201d appeared on his popular cutting-edge science website, EDGE (www.edge.org), he received a record number of responses from the intellectuals of the EDGE community.  In his essay, Brockman noted that the American intellectual had become proudly or defiantly ignorant of major scientific accomplishments.  According to Brockman, intellectual thought was becoming trapped in a \u201cswelling spiral of commentary,\u201d and often ignored the real world.  Citing C.P. Snow\u2019s theory of two cultures: the literary intellectual and the scientist, Brockman predicted an \u201cemerging third culture\u201d where scientists and other empirical thinkers, through their work and writing, would redefine who and what we are.In The New Humanists: Science At the Edge, Brockman has assembled some of the top scientists of today: Jared Diamond, Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett, Marvin Minsky, Lee Smolin, and others, and has them discuss the unique contributions each of them is making to the development of modern thought.  Some of these thinkers are in sync, others in dissent, but what emerges in The New Humanists is a dialogue that serves as a support to Brockman\u2019s theory and an introduction to some of the best scientific minds of the 21st century.",

Insatiable will envelop readers in the personal and seemingly tangible worlds of each of the main characters. What makes this novel so forceful and vibrant is the way Eliot weaves her story through dynamics that inform these friendships and the therapy that helps them address their pain and fears. For every teen trapped in this seemingly endless cycle, and those who simply enjoy reading about real life issues (i.e. teen bestsellers Speak and Smack), Insatiable is a must-read.",

In 1962, at age seventeen, Karen Armstrong entered a convent, eager to meet God. After seven brutally unhappy years as a nun, she left her order to pursue English literature at Oxford. But convent life had profoundly altered her, and coping with the outside world and her expiring faith proved to be excruciating. Her deep solitude and a terrifying illness\u2013diagnosed only years later as epilepsy\u2014marked her forever as an outsider. In her own mind she was a complete failure: as a nun, as an academic, and as a normal woman capable of intimacy. Her future seemed very much in question until she stumbled into comparative theology. What she found, in learning, thinking, and writing about other religions, was the ecstasy and transcendence she had never felt as a nun.",

        "Description": "In this provocative work, seasoned journalist Gershom Gorenberg portrays a deadly mix of religious extremism, violence, and Mideast politics, as expressed in the struggle for the sacred center of Jerusalem. Known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, this thirty-five-acre enclosure at the southeast corner of Jerusalem's Old City is the most contested piece of real estate on earth. Here nationalism combines with fundamentalist faith in a volatile brew. Members of the world's three major monotheistic faiths--Judaism, Christianity, and Islam--hold this spot to be the key to salvation as they await the end of the world, and struggle to fulfill conflicting religious prophecies with dangerous political consequences. Adroitly portraying American radio evangelists of the End, radical Palestinian sheikhs, and Israeli ex-terrorists, Gorenberg explains why believers hope for the End, and why prominent American fundamentalists provide hard-line support for Israel while looking forward to the apocalypse. He makes sense of the messianic fervor that has driven some Israeli settlers to oppose peace. And he describes the Islamic apocalyptic visions that cast Israel's actions in Jerusalem as diabolic plots.The End of Days shows how conflict over Jerusalem and the fiery belief in apocalypse continue to have a potent impact on world politics and why a lasting peace in the Middle East continues to prove elusive.",

An album of lost photographs serves as our guide to the stops along two antiquated railroad lines winding through Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. In this ancient American landscape, marked by Civil War battles and earlier settlements, we follow album and railroad on a journey from past to present, as Lucius Caton pieces together his sister Anna's love affair with their cousin, the photographer Russell McKay, out of the fragmentary clues she embeds in the album. Anna is an artist, eccentric, elusive and beguiling, whose life remains a dark puzzle to Lucius. As the story of her romance with Russell unfolds, we catch a glimpse of Lucius's complicated feelings for his sister. Most compellingly, Stations is about the journey we each take along the tracks of memory where time and place intersect - the lost world of home.",

Hank makes enchiladas, and at the luncheon, Ms. Adolf piles her plate with lots of food. But after a few bites, her face turns bright red-one of the dishes is super-spicy! Ms. Adolf accuses someone of playing a mean practical joke and punishes the entire class with no recess until the guilty party comes forward. Hank realizes his trouble with numbers might have caused the problem-what if he accidentally used three cups of peppers instead of 1/3 cup? Will Hank be able to get recess back for everyone without getting detention for the rest of his life?  Illustrated by Carol Heyer.",

        "Authors": "By Shermer, Michael",
        "Description": "At the beginning of the twentieth century, social scientists predicted that belief in God would decrease by the end of the century because of the secularization of society, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Recent polls show that 96% of Americans believe in God. Despite Nietzche's claim that God is dead, He has never been more alive for millions of believers who stand steadfast in their convictions.  Why is this? Why are people turning to religion in greater numbers than ever before? Why do people believe in God at all?In How We Believe, Michael Shermer presents the results of an exhaustive empirical study in which he asked 10,000 Americans how and why they believe and about details of their faith.  How We Believe offers fresh and startling insights into age-old questions and examines:\u2022 What it means to believe in God\u2022 \"Proofs\" of God and what they tell us about religious faith\u2022 The relationship between science and religion\u2022 How humans, as the storytelling animal, came to become Homo religious\u2022 How to find the sacred in the age of science This edition includes a new introduction by the author that brings readers up to date on recent studies on prayer and healing, on the changing religious attitudes and beliefs of Americans, and on the controversial debate about the relationship of science and religion that continues to grab headlines. Shermer also addresses his critics, both believers and atheists, on why belief or disbelief in God is not a question of evidence but of faith. Yet having been a believer and studied the history of science, Shermer is open-minded and inclusive throughout the book. He is most interested in knowing how and why, not in showing right or wrong. Thought provoking, comprehensive, and well researched, How We Believe is certain to spark lively debate among believers and nonbelievers alike.",

A Jewish girl of no royal heritage was chosen to become the Queen of Persia. Was it her beauty alone, or did she know an important and mysterious truth? Tenney challenges his readers to move beyond formal petitions or even \"storming the gates of heaven\" to that intimate embrace of worship where the bride's petitions move the King's heart and where kingdoms, people, and situations begin to shift like pawns on a divine chessboard.",

        "Title": "All the Pope's Men: The Inside Story of How the Vatican Really Thinks",
        "Authors": "By Allen, John L.",
        "Description": "A fascinating and enlightening look at the world\u2019s oldest and most mysterious institution, written by an American journalist with unparalleled knowledge about the Vatican's past and present.The sexual abuse scandals that shook American and British Catholicism in 2002 brought to light a long-standing cultural gap between the English-speaking Catholic world and the Vatican. In Rome, the crisis was often seen as an attack on the Church mounted by money-hungry lawyers, a hostile press, and liberal activists who used it as a way to turn attention on such concerns as celibacy, women\u2019s ordination, and lay empowerment. When the Vatican struck down the U.S. bishops\u2019 draft for handling allegations of sexual abuse, many saw it as an attempt to curb an independent American Catholic church. Yet, as time passed, it became clear that the Vatican\u2019s well-founded concerns about due process were shared by most liberal U.S. bishops and canon lawyers. ALL THE POPE\u2019S MEN is a lucid, in-depth guide to the sometimes puzzling, often incomprehensible inner workings of the Vatican. It reveals how decisions are made, how papal bureaucrats think, and how careers in the Roman Curia are shaped. It debunks the myths that have fed the distrust and suspicions many English-speaking Catholics harbor about the way the Vatican conducts its business, explains who really wields the power, and offers entertaining profiles of the personalities, historical and present-day, who have wielded that power for good and for bad. A thoughtful analysis of the recent sexual abuse crisis sheds light on how the Vatican perceives the Church in the United States.  Balanced, lively, and filled with Vatican history and lore, ALL THE POPE\u2019S MEN provides the general reader with an authoritative picture of the highly charged relationship between the Vatican and the richest, most influential national Catholic church in the world today.",

It was to be the first of the Crusades, a holy war that would focus the power of the European kingdoms against a common enemy. The Crusades became the stuff of romantic legend, but in reality they were a series of rabidly savage battles carried out in the name of Christian piety to advance the power of the Western Church. Their legacy of religious violence is felt today as the age-old conflict of Christians, Jews, and Muslims persists.",
