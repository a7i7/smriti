        "Authors": "By Clapton, Eric",
        "Description": "\u201cI found a pattern in my behavior that had been repeating itself for years, decades even. Bad choices were my specialty, and if something honest and decent came along, I would shun it or run the other way.\u201dWith striking intimacy and candor, Eric Clapton tells the story of his eventful and inspiring life in this poignant and honest autobiography. More than a rock star, he is an icon, a living embodiment of the history of rock music. Well known for his reserve in a profession marked by self-promotion, flamboyance, and spin, he now chronicles, for the first time, his remarkable personal and professional journeys. Born illegitimate in 1945 and raised by his grandparents, Eric never knew his father and, until the age of nine, believed his actual mother to be his sister. In his early teens his solace was the guitar, and his incredible talent would make him a cult hero in the clubs of Britain and inspire devoted fans to scrawl \u201cClapton is God\u201d on the walls of London\u2019s Underground.  With the formation of Cream, the world's first supergroup, he became a worldwide superstar, but conflicting personalities tore the band apart within two years. His stints in Blind Faith, in Delaney and Bonnie and Friends, and in Derek and the Dominos were also short-lived but yielded some of the most enduring songs in history, including the classic \u201cLayla.\u201d  During the late sixties he played as a guest with Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan, as well as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and longtime friend George Harrison. It was while working with the latter that he fell for George\u2019s wife, Pattie Boyd, a seemingly unrequited love that led him to the depths of despair, self-imposed seclusion, and drug addiction. By the early seventies he had overcome his addiction and released the bestselling album 461 Ocean Boulevard, with its massive hit \u201cI Shot the Sheriff.\u201d He followed that with the platinum album Slowhand, which included \u201cWonderful Tonight,\u201d the touching love song to Pattie, whom he finally married at the end of 1979. A short time later, however, Eric had replaced heroin with alcohol as his preferred vice, following a pattern of behavior that not only was detrimental to his music but contributed to the eventual breakup of his marriage.  In the eighties he would battle and begin his recovery from alcoholism and become a father. But just as his life was coming together, he was struck by a terrible blow: His beloved four-year-old son, Conor, died in a freak accident. At an earlier time Eric might have coped with this tragedy by fleeing into a world of addiction. But now a much stronger man, he took refuge in music, responding with the achingly beautiful \u201cTears in Heaven.\u201dClapton is the powerfully written story of a survivor, a man who has achieved the pinnacle of success despite extraordinary demons. It is one of the most compelling memoirs of our time.",

        "Description": "Fiction can often tell the truth better than nonfiction. And there is a lot of truth that needs to be told. -Richard A. Clarke  From the noted counterterrorism expert and #1 bestselling author comes an astonishing fiction debut-a novel of terrorism, warring nations, and political treachery... that could happen tomorrow.  For three decades, Richard A. Clarke worked in the White House, State Department, and Pentagon. As adviser to four presidents, he traveled throughout the Middle East, visiting palaces, military bases, and intelligence centers, meeting rulers, soldiers, and spies. Some of what he found appeared in Against All Enemies. Much more of it appears here.  In an extraordinary geopolitical thriller filled with the kind of cutting-edge authenticity only someone on the inside could bring, Clarke takes readers just five years into the future, when forces both in the Middle East and the United States are at work to launch another war. But this time, it could be bigger. This time, it could be nuclear, and spread to Asia and beyond.  A coup has finally toppled the sheiks of Saudi Arabia, and put a determined but shaky Islamic government in its place. Everywhere, the scent of oil has begun to attract the scorpions, and among them are men in Washington and another capital ready to strike a devil's bargain to fundamentally realign the map of the Middle East. The plans are not the same, however-though some of the planners think they are. Hidden agendas, fierce ambition, conflicting loyalties, faulty intelligence, catastrophic miscalculation-soon the dominos will start to fall, and not even the efforts of a few dedicated men and women on the outside may be able to stop an unstoppable folly. . . .  Blending exceptional realism with intricate plotting, razor-sharp suspense, and a remarkable cast of characters, The Scorpion's Gate will be one of the most talked-about novels of the year.",

        "Description": "In this age of \"political correctness,\" Christmas has become our most controversial holiday. Each year brings new court battles over nativity scenes on public property and heated school board meetings in the public schools.Author Albert J. Menendez traces this dispute as far back as the fourth century, when Catholic orthodoxy turned Christmas into a major propaganda tool as well as a religious observance. Over the centuries there has been a surprising amount of disagreement among the various Christian sects about the nature of the Christian observance and whether Christmas should be celebrated as a holiday at all. The English Puritans and the Scottish Presbyterians, for example, were adamantly opposed to Christmas celebrations.In our own day, the controversy has engendered a complex legal tangle stretching from local councils to the United States Supreme Court. Menendez reviews the specific arguments and decisions in the judicial debate over religious symbols in the public square, and he explores the broader implications of the controversy for church-state relations. The December Wars provides a fascinating historical and legal perspective on our most popular holiday.",

Now, with Five Boys, Jackson creates a brilliantly captivating and distinctive tale of the impact of World War II on the home front, bringing to light a lost place and time with an expert touch. When Bobby is evacuated from London to a remote Devonshire village, a strange new chapter of his life begins. Empty of its menfolk, the village is given over to the \"stay behinds\": the women, the old and young, the nonconscripts, and five terrifying boys who accuse Bobby of being a Nazi spy -- subjecting him to horrible mistreatment. At the center of these eccentric folk is the enigmatic Bee King, a mysterious figure who exercises a powerful, hypnotic influence on the village, and especially the boys. As the days wind down to the D-day invasion, excitement and tension overtake this remote coastal town. While the Allied soldiers crash the beaches along the French coast, the villagers will enact their own drama -- a tense interplay of events that will engulf them all and ultimately reveal the truth about the Bee King. Riveting and thoroughly researched, Five Boys offers an unforgettable poetic fusion of fable and history that is certain to linger with the reader long after the last page has been turned.",

He covers everything from preparing a focused mission statement and hiring responsible employees to delegating effectively, responding to technological advances, and sustaining flexibility.

His immune system was at an all-time low, as he suffered from Crohn's disease, food allergies, anemia, fibromyalgia, intestinal parasites, and a host of other conditions. After seeing over 70 health professionals, using both conventional and alternative medicines, Rubin was sent home in a wheelchair to die.But his story didn't end there. Through determination and a powerful faith in God, Rubin refused to give in to disease.

Now, ten years later, Rubin is fully recovered-and he desires to share the keys to his own good health. These keys aren't just for the disease-ridden; they are for anyone desiring to live an abundant life of health and wellness.",

He sees that America is in the midst of a fierce culture war between those who embrace traditional values and those who want to change America into a \u201csecular-progressive\u201d country. This is a conflict that differs in many ways from the usual liberal/conservative divide, but it is no less heated, and the stakes are even higher.In Culture Warrior, Bill O\u2019Reilly defines this war and analyzes the competing philosophies of the traditionalist and secular-progressive camps. He examines why the nation\u2019s motto \u201cE Pluribus Unum\u201d (\u201cFrom Many, One\u201d) might change to \u201cWhat About Me?\u201d; dissects the forces driving the secular-progressive agenda in the media and behind the scenes, including George Soros, George Lakoff, and the ACLU; and dives into matters of race, education, and the war on terror. He also shows how the culture war has played out in such high-profile instances as The Passion of the Christ, Fahrenheit 9/11, the abuse epidemic (child and otherwise), and the embattled place of religion in public life\u2014with special emphasis on the war against Christmas. Whatever controversies are roiling the nation, he fearlessly confronts them\u2014and no one will be in the dark about which side he\u2019s on.Culture Warrior showcases Bill O\u2019Reilly at his most eloquent and impassioned. He is an unrelenting fighter for the soul of America, and in this book he fights the good fight for the traditional values that have served this country so well for so long.",

In the bar on the Eton, he had the choice spot, discreetly purveying high-stakes drugs to the Eton's well-to-do patrons. Now he's dead, his throat cut, and the police know that the drug syndicates are in an all-out war, with the Eton as the prize. Naomi Anstruther, a cop, is sent undercover into this turbulent drug world. Right away she becomes an unknowing pawn in the rival criminals' plans--and in the complex struggle between Harpur and his rival, ACC Desmond Iles. When Naomi's cover is threatened, Harpur and Iles must act with lightning speed to salvage the operation and--in an explosion of violence--try to get her out alive. This is Bill James's most brilliantly plotted story yet, and the tension is high-wire to the last minute. Bill James's Roses, Roses was named by Publishers Weekly as one of the nine best mysteries of 1998.",

When a careless mistake destroys the barrier between virtual reality and her corporate life, Elaine perceives a disturbing connection between her nightly degradation and her professional success. As she becomes obsessed with finding her real-life paramour, her speculations about Inez's true identity quickly run wild, and soon all of her once-innocent encounters with friends and colleagues are charged with sexual overtones. In a darkly comic, highly erotic tale for our time, Martha Baer captures the allure of anonymous cybersex and the elusiveness of gender identity in a world where the real and the virtually real become almost indistinguishable.",

American representative democracy is suffering through its worst crisis in many years, and while many Americans recognize it, they just don't know what to do about it. In \"A More Perfect Union,\" Steven Hill offers specific solutions for election reform. Arguing that much of what ails American politics is rooted in antiquated 18th-century practices, Hill makes a stirring call for national elections standards, nonpartisan election officials, an Election Day holiday, and other repairs to the nuts and bolts of the voting process. Further, he calls for the end of winner-take-all elections, adoption of proportional representation, reform of presidential elections, fairer representation in the U.S. Senate, universal voter registration, public financing of elections, and free air time for candidates. An inspiring blueprint for repairing and reinvigorating American politics, Hill's simple yet effective proposals strengthen not just the electoral system, but the republic itself.",

Meanwhile, Lloyd and Evelyn Decker run out of reasons to stay home and hit the road in a powder blue Road Ranger to find their wayward children; Oliver the Dreamer, a soft-spoken amnesiac, finds a home and a family under a bridge in Seattle; and Webster Cummings, a statistical research analyst, survives a fall from a commuter plane to bring together these and other strange and wonderful characters for an unexpected revelation that alters all their lives.",

        "Title": "The American Hour: A Time of Reckoning and the Once and Future Role of Faith",
        "Authors": "By Guinness, Os",
        "Description": "The American Hour is a searching assessment of the strength of the American republic at the end of what has been called the \"American Century.\" In an incisive analysis, Os Guinness examines the ways in which the current crisis of cultural authority strikes at the heart of American identity. As he shows, this crisis has occurred because America's beliefs, traditions, and ideals - civic as well as religious - are losing their power to shape the private and public lives of countless Americans.He first charts this growing crisis in America's moral and cultural order, tracing its roots early in this century to the first open phase of conflict, which began to build in the fifties and climaxed in the cultural revolution of the sixties. He goes on to examine the subsequent conservative counter-revolution, focusing throughout on the impact of this crisis on three areas vital to the health of the republic - on American identity, as in the currently contested notion of what it means to be an American; American public philosophy, including the now controversial relationship of religion and public life; and American republican character, including our distinctive emphasis on the importance of the \"habits of the heart.\"Guinness also examines the historical role of religion in American society and its integral function in American public life. He explores how religion came to lose its power as a vital shaping force of America's moral and cultural order, and he considers the consequences of this loss. He then establishes four scenarios that range from the continued decline of religion in public life to a resurgence of faith, showing how each possible outcome could affect American society in the upcoming century.Examining closely the recent controversies over religion and politics, Guinness concludes by setting forth a vision of how we can move beyond these struggles and provide America's diverse faiths with a revitalized and constructive role in public life.",

But to his great surprise, the air traffic controllers will not let him land in England - they tell Holland that his sick passenger has contracted a dangerous new form of influenza and that the plane must return to Germany.But when German officials also refuse the landing, and other European countries follow suit, Holland begins to suspect that he's in much more trouble than anyone's letting on. In fact, his sick passenger is carrying a deadly virus accidentally released from a Bavarian laboratory, and it is feared that everyone on board is now infected. At the same time, someone with access to the CIA's computers wants to shoot the plane out of the sky, and there is a United States ambassador on board with powerful terrorist enemies who want to see him dead. While the panic on the ground spreads from the White House Situation Room to a small airport in the Ukrainian Republic, Captain Holland has only one concern: Where and when can he land?",

        "Title": "Meritocracy",

        "Description": "Meritocracy is the story of a generation when it was young, caught at the moment when history arrived to exact a tragic and inevitable price. It is the end of the summer of 1966 and a small group of friends, recent Yale graduates, gather in a Maine summer cottage to say good-bye to one of their own. Harry Nolan is joining the Army and may be sent to Vietnam. Also present is Harry's beautiful young bride, Sascha.Harry and Sascha represent to their friends the apex of their generation. Sascha has men falling for her \"up and down the eastern seaboard,\" and Harry, a rich and fearless Californian, son of a United States senator, has his friends convinced that he will one day be president. The story proceeds from the point-of-view of one of the friends, Louie, whose unspoken love for Sascha is like a worm that works its way through the narrative, cracking apart every innocent assumption. An aura of power, earned and unearned, assumed and desired, hangs over this Ivy League world.And it settles at last on Harry, who on this final weekend before his induction comes to understand a terrible paradox: if he's going into the Army simply to maintain his political viability, his action will dishonor his right to lead; but if he doesn't go, he will likely never have the chance. His wrestling with this paradox unleashes a spiral of events that becomes as fateful for all the characters as it is emblematic of the times they grew up in.In one sense, Meritocracy is a novel for the Al Gores and John Kerrys and George Bushes of today's America. But in a larger sense it is a book for all those of the postwar generation who have mourned the loss of their true \"best and brightest,\" and who regret how the life of their nation, so brightly and hopefully imagined when they were young, and now entrusted to their care, has come to be diminished.",
