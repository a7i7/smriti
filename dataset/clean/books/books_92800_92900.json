        "Description": "Sir William Wallace was one of the greatest heroes in Scotland's long struggle for independence from the English yoke. D.J. Gray probes the character and life of this resolute, and at times pitiless, warrior. Wallace raised a people's army to fight against the forces of Edward I, and his victory at the battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297 resulted in his elevation to the status of Guardian of Scotland. However, furious at the success of a man he regarded as a guerrilla, King Edward relentlessly pursued Wallace to his death. Remembered today as the architect of Scottish independence, Wallace's story gives a curious insight into the mind of the modern freedom fighter.",

        "Description": "Mary and Ingrid are sisters who were born and brought up in China but now reside in the United States. Mary is the older of the two; seemingly a devoted wife, mother, and churchgoer. Yet she is tormented by adultery, a grudge toward her parents, and her despair at work. Her estranged sister Ingrid has never settled for anything; she prefers her bohemian friends\u2019 culture to her own, and is haunted by her college boyfriend\u2019s tragic death. When their widowed mother travels to the United States for the first time, they can\u2019t avoid a family get-together. Amid all it stirs up, it becomes clear that the uneasy relationship between the sisters has roots deeper than either had ever acknowledged\u2014and extends to their parents and their homeland. Stretching from mid-century China to the United States at the turn of the millennium, Beautiful as Yesterday explores issues of identity, of family and friendship, love and loss. Written in beautifully crafted prose, this is a penetrating exploration of what it means to belong, and the impact of history and memories on one\u2019s life.",

        "Description": "When you host a program for women, and you open up the phone lines, email box, and Facebook page, you often resonate with their heart-breaking stories. That\u2019s been the case as women have tuned in to Moody Radio\u2019s Midday Connection, a radio show co-hosted by author Anita Lustrea, and shared their struggles and victories. When issues are raised such as loneliness, friendship, mothering, domestic abuse, sexual addiction, and body image, women pour out their hearts.  Lustrea has heard heart-breaking stories through the years, and those stories have intersected with her own story of heartbreak. God lovingly weaves these stories into a tapestry to be used for His glory. Lustrea\u2019s story means nothing without the impact of all of the other stories she has heard. Sometimes the church tries to sweep the hard stories under the carpet. Somehow we\u2019ve gotten the impression that the hard things of life shouldn\u2019t be shared. But when you allow your stories to become known, start to interact with the stories of others, and then allow God to work in and through your life, something miraculous starts to happen.In What Women Tell Me, Anita Lustrea tells her story along with the difficult stories of other women. For a long time, she listened to those who said \u201cyou can only hurt others by sharing your wounds.\u201d When she realized that was a lie, she saw for the first time that through her wounds, she could be an agent of healing in the body of Christ.",

To this day, my   family is in disagreement as to precisely when the nightmare began. For me, it was   the morning Daddy and Luther discovered Marvin, beaten, shot, and dying, in the Klan\u2019s   stomping grounds off Round Lake Road. My brother Ren disagrees. He points to the   small cluster of scars that begin just outside his left eye and trail horizontally   across his temple to the top of his ear. Ren claims it started when the men in white   robes took the unprecedented step of shooting at two white children. Others say it   was when Mr. Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP and Mr. Hoover\u2019s FBI came to town. Mother   and Daddy shake their heads. In their minds, the real beginning was much earlier....",

But in spite of this vigilance, our understanding hasn\u2019t gone beyond the caricatures. Who are evangelicals, really? What are they like in private, and what do they want? Is it possible that beneath the differences in culture and language, church and party, we might share with them some common purpose?To find out, Gina Welch, a young secular Jew from Berkeley, joined Jerry Falwell\u2019s Thomas Road Baptist Church. Over the course of nearly two years, Welch immersed herself in the life and language of the devout: she learned to interpret the world like an evangelical, weathered the death of Falwell, and embarked on a mission trip to Alaska intended to save one hundred souls. Alive to the meaning behind the music and the mind behind the slogans, Welch recognized the allure of evangelicalism, even for the godless, realizing that the congregation met needs and answered questions she didn\u2019t know she had. What emerges is a riveting account of a skeptic\u2019s transformation from uninformed cynicism to compassionate understanding, and a rare view of how evangelicals see themselves. Revealing their generosity and hopefulness, as well as their prejudice and exceptionalism, In the Land of Believers is a call for comprehending, rather than dismissing, the impassioned believers who have become so central a force in American life.",

        "Title": "Punching Out: One Year in a Closing Auto Plant",
        "Authors": "By Clemens, Paul",
        "Description": "Built in 1919, the Budd Company stamping plant on Detroit's East Side was one of the oldest active auto plants in America's foremost industrial city, a potent symbol of our nation's proudest moments and the triumphs of its working class. Eighty-seven years later, things could not have been more different: In 2006, the two-million-square-foot facility was unceremoniously closed, its machinery dismantled and sent, piece by piece, overseas.Paul Clemens, Detroit born and bred, spent the best part of a calendar year watching the Budd plant slowly disappear, along with the American dream that once flourished for our workers and their families. Punching Out is a compelling firsthand account of the complex and traumatic, yet riveting, process of its dissolution\u00f9from the first appearance of the announced plant closing in the papers, through visits to the union local and the Budd plant itself in its final days, then on to the postclosing auction of much of the plant's equipment. Finally, and most vividly, Clemens describes the logistical and physical challenges of disassembling the plant's massive press lines, several stories tall and weighing thousands of tons, which were sent abroad to Brazil and Mexico, where the book concludes. The motley crew responsible for this disassembly process resembles a modern-day version of those aboard Melville's Pequod: former roofers and plumbers, an Iraq War veteran, a Bosnian immigrant, a strip-club bouncer, a repo man, itinerant riggers known as \"the Arkansas Boys,\" and\u00f9most poignantly\u00f9a couple of former Budd employees. All found work as part of the team charged with dismembering this vast mausoleum of a bygone industrial age. Their stories reveal, with troubling clarity, both the resilient nature of the American working class and the reasons why they have to be resilient.An eyewitness report from the meanest, sharpest edge of America's de-industrialization, Punching Out is a eulogy for the working-class culture that once defined a prosperous America. At once tender and brutal, humorous and sad, it is also strangely uplifting\u00f9even as it bears witness to a process that is anything but.",

        "Authors": "By Rosenbaum, Ron",
        "Description": "The president loses control of fifty nukes for nearly an hour. Russian nuclear bombers almost bump wingtips with American fighter jets over the Pacific coast. North Korea detonates nuclear weapons underground. Iran's nuclear shroud is penetrated by a computer worm. Al-Qaeda goes on the hunt for Pakistan's bomb, and Israelis debate the merit of a preemptive nuclear strike. Treaties are signed, but thousands of nuclear weapons are still on hair-trigger alert.This is how the end begins.In this startling new book, bestselling author Ron Rosenbaum gives us a wake-up call about this new age of peril and delivers a provocative analysis of how close---and how often---the world has come to nuclear annihilation and why we are once again on the brink.Rosenbaum tracks down key characters in our new nuclear drama and probes deeply into their war game strategies, fears, and moral agonies. He travels to Omaha's underground nuclear command center, goes deep into the missile silo complexes beneath the Great Plains, and holds in his hands a set of nuclear launch keys.Along the way, Rosenbaum confronts the missile men as well as the general at the very top of our nation's nuclear command system with tough questions about the terrifying assumptions underlying it. He reveals disturbing flaws in our nuclear launch control system, suggests remedies for them, shows how the old Cold War system of bipolar deterrence has become dangerously unstable, and examines the new movement for nuclear abolition.Having explored the depths of Hitler's evil and the intense emotion of Shakespeare's tragedies, Rosenbaum now has produced a powerful, urgently needed work that challenges us: Can we undream our nightmare?",

The question is, was that the high point for the party, or was it just the beginning of a Democratic golden age?As author Dylan Loewe compellingly argues, Democrats now have a unique chance to make their majority permanent and to dominate politics for a generation to come---provided they recognize their opportunity and employ the right strategies to capitalize on it. From the midterms and redistricting to Obama's reelection, from the search for his successor in 2016 to the changing political landscape in 2020 and beyond, Loewe walks readers through what it will take for Democrats to stay in power and why the possibility of turning the nation \"permanently blue\" is suddenly so bright.",

        "Description": "A dazzling debut that is at once a lightly erudite novel of ideas and a darkly charming love story set on an island   off the coast of Maine-the perfect sophisticated summer read.  By turns funny, charming, and   tragic, Rosecrans Baldwin's debut novel takes us inside the heart and mind of Dr. Victor Aaron, a leading Alzheimer's   researcher at the Soborg Institute on Mount Desert Island in Maine. Victor spends his days alternating between long   hours in the sterile lab and running through memories of his late wife, Sara. He has preserved their marriage as a   sort of perfect, if tumultuous, duet between two opposite but precisely compatible souls. But one day, in   the midst of organizing his already hyperorganized life, Victor discovers a series of index cards covered in Sara's   handwriting. They chronicle the major \"changes in direction\" of their marriage, written as part of a brief fling with   couples counseling. Sara's version of their great love story is markedly different from his own, which, for the eminent   memory specialist, is a startling revelation. Victor is forced to reevaluate and relive each moment of their marriage,   never knowing is the revisions will hurt or hearten. Meanwhile, as Victor's faith in memory itself unravels, so too   does his precisely balanced support network, a group of strong women-from his lab assistant to Aunt Betsy,   doddering doyenne of the island-that had, so far, allowed him to avoid grieving. Rosecrans Baldwin   shows himself here to be a young writer bursting with talent and imagination who deftly handles this aching love   story with sensitivity and unexpected maturity. You Lost Me There is a treasure of a book filled with   beautiful, intelligent prose, a book that wears its smarts lightly and probes its emotions deeply.    Watch a Video",

Bacevich's bestselling challenge to the conventional wisdom that American security requires the United States (and us alone) to maintain a permanent armed presence around the globe, to prepare our forces for military operations in far-flung regions, and to be ready to intervene anywhere at any time. Adopted by administrations on both sides of the political spectrum during the past half century, this Washington consensus on national security has become foreign policy gospel when, according to Bacevich, it has outlasted its usefulness.With vivid, incisive analysis, Bacevich assails and exposes the preconceptions, biases, and habits that underlie this pervasive faith in military might, especially the notion that overwhelming superiority will oblige others to accommodate America's needs and desires\u2014whether for cheap oil, cheap credit, or cheap consumer goods. Instead, Bacevich argues that we must reconsider the principles which shape American policy in the world and acknowledge that fixing Afghanistan should not take precedence over fixing Detroit. As we enter a period when our militarism has become both unaffordable and increasingly dangerous, replacing this Washington consensus is crucial to America's future and may yet offer the key to the country's salvation.",

After the assassination of a prominent Nigerian politician, New York journalist Lindsay Cameron moves to Lagos to follow a trail of corruption, drug smuggling and murder. What begins with a coveted and exclusive interview with President Michael Olumide quickly spirals into something darker and increasingly dangerous. When two high-profile figures on opposite sides of the political spectrum-Olumide's most trusted adviser and his archrival for the presidency-are killed in suspiciously quick succession, Olumide's promise to hold free elections is cast in doubt. As Lindsay races her colleagues to penetrate the intricate network of Western officials, foreign correspondents, and CIA agents who run the Nigerian show, her entanglement with a rare art dealer leads her into terrain that's unfamiliar in every respect-from matters of the heart to matters of politics and trade that have enshrouded an entire nation in greed and corruption of deadly proportions. Set in the mid-1990s flux of worldwide insurrections and war, Nina Darnton's debut presents an ambiance that's as lushly exotic as it is unstable.",

Her neighbors hear her cries; no one calls for help.  Unfolding over the course of two hours, Good Neighbors is the story of the woman's last night.

        "Description": "What if digital communication felt as real as being touched?This question led Michael Chorost to explore profound new ideas triggered by lab research around the world, and the result is the book you now hold. Marvelous and momentous, World Wide Mind takes mind-to-mind communication out of the realm of science fiction and reveals how we are on the verge of a radical new understanding of human interaction. Chorost himself has computers in his head that enable him to hear: two cochlear implants. Drawing on that experience, he proposes that our Paleolithic bodies and our Pentium chips could be physically merged, and he explores the technologies that could do it. He visits engineers building wearable computers that allow people to be online every waking moment, and scientists working on implanted chips that would let paralysis victims communicate. Entirely new neural interfaces are being developed that let computers read and alter neural activity in unprecedented detail. But we all know how addictive the Internet is. Chorost explains the addiction: he details the biochemistry of what makes you hunger to touch your iPhone and check your email. He proposes how we could design a mind-to-mind technology that would let us reconnect with our bodies and enhance our relationships. With such technologies, we could achieve a collective consciousness\u2014a World Wide Mind. And it would be humankind\u2019s next evolutionary step. With daring and sensitivity, Chorost writes about how he learned how to enhance his own relationships by attending workshops teaching the power of touch. He learned how to bring technology and communication together to find true love, and his story shows how we can master technology to make ourselves more human rather than less. World Wide Mind offers a new understanding of how we communicate, what we need to connect fully with one another, and how our addiction to email and texting can be countered with technologies that put us\u2014literally\u2014in each other\u2019s minds.",

        "Title": "Rebound: Why America Will Emerge Stronger From the Financial Crisis",
        "Authors": "By Rose, Stephen J.",
        "Description": "Rebound takes the currently unthinkable view that the economy will bounce back faster and stronger from the downturn than most economists expect. Noted Labor economist Stephen J. Rose amasses data on the economic performance of America over the last 30 years to debunk myths about declining middle class incomes, burger-flipping jobs and global competition. He also describes the evolution of the financial crisis and mortgage lending implosion under the rubric of \u201cbrilliant idiocy\u201d to show how the investors, financial firms, and regulators all made devastating mistakes in pursuit of quick gains.   The book argues forcefully that simple financial regulation and forthcoming investments in education, health care and energy will pay quick and healthy dividends. Using economic analysis rather than partisan argument, Rebound cuts through the clutter of political debate to show how the economy will return to high growth rates.",

        "Description": "The second book in the groundbreaking bestselling trilogy, from the creator of the CSI franchise.    Steve Dark was once a lost soul, torn between his family and his one-of-a-kind talent for hunting and   catching serial killers-especially those so-called \"level 26\" killers whose depravity exceeds law enforcement's   official scale of evil. In his reluctant pursuit of justice Dark once crossed the ultimate line, a line that might cause a   lesser man to lose himself completely. Not Dark. When the world took everything from him, when it   destroyed the very thing Dark once lived for, it brought a moment of clarity that few before him have witnessed, and   sparked a transformation that, several years later, is only just complete. Dark is now a man on a   mission. A mission that no longer requires law enforcement support. A mission unbound by authorities, moral or   otherwise, and supported by a mysterious benefactor with unknown goals of her own. A mission that, at long last,   allows him to embrace his destiny. Dark is finally ready- ready to take justice to the next level.    Watch a Video",

As Ronda shares, Southerners don\u2019t just talk about God, they have a \u201ckitchen-table faith,\u201d that feels like a comfortable, trusted neighbor who sits down and stays for a good, long visit. It\u2019s a faith you live and breathe, day-in, day-out, whether it\u2019s praying to the good Lord as you sit on the porch swing or finding joy in a delicious pan of cornbread. As Ronda says, Southern faith \u201cis a faith that is plain, simple, and sturdy, that is utilitarian in practice and that fits as comfortably in the hands of Southern women as a baby, an iron skillet, a hair brush, a telephone, or a broom.\u201d From stories of moonshine and revivals, Sunday dinners and new Easter outfits, prayers answered and griefs shared, you\u2019ll discover a faith that supports you when the trials and heartaches of life cause you to stumble, a faith that grabs you by the elbow and steadies you on the path.",

Secrets that could cost you millions of dollars\u2014and brand you as a criminal. Innocent Spouse is an eye-opening memoir that asks a provocative and disturbing question: Is it possible to really know and trust someone, even your spouse? Carol Ross Joynt was a successful television producer in Washington, D.C.  Her husband, Howard, owned Nathans, a legendary restaurant in Georgetown. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, Carol and Howard lived a fairy-tale life\u2014spending weekends at their Chesapeake Bay estate, rubbing shoulders with New York\u2019s and Washington\u2019s elite, and raising their beloved son, Spencer. But everything changed with Howard\u2019s sudden death when Spencer was only five years old.  Like any widow, Carol was devastated because she lost the love of her life and her son\u2019s father. But soon Carol had much more to cope with than her grief and new life as a single parent. As she was forced to take over her family\u2019s legal and financial responsibilities, as well as run Howard\u2019s restaurant on her own, Carol discovered that her husband had secrets, and one of them, an almost $3 million debt to the IRS, threatened to derail her entire life. And even though Carol didn\u2019t know anything about the tax fraud\u2014finances had always been Howard's department\u2014no one cared. As his surviving spouse, legally, Carol was responsible. As Carol picks up the pieces of her fractured life and copes with her sadness and anger, she learns to become something she\u2019d never been before: self-sufficient. Poignant, eye-opening, and at times heartbreaking, Innocent Spouse is ultimately an inspiring story of strength and newfound independence in the face of loss and betrayal.",

        "Authors": "By Lane, Randall",
        "Description": "\"As eight sets of boxers slugged through the night, traders and bankers streamed toward Hammerstein, unfurling rolls of hundreds in hopes of charming the check-in girls and buying their way into the capacity event. Via text messages and cell phone calls, The Word had gone out: Wall Street was celebrating tonight.\"The past month had seen the Dow Jones Industrial Average surge past 14,000 points for the first time. These guys were making fortunes by creating securities more complicated than the Rosetta stone and also far more valuable. For these guys---my guys, for better or worse---all was right and just with the world.\"No one had yet developed a name for this era, this decade with the once-a-millennium calendar quirk of two zeroes perched in the middle. As I gazed across the room in front of me, `the Zeroes' seemed fairly spot-on. Wall Street's breathless pursuit of zeroes, that easy-money mentality, had permeated every aspect of our culture. In my role as Wall Street's scorekeeper, I too had fallen prey to the mind warp.\"But I had no inkling that, when the figures were tallied at the end of 2009, there would be zero median income growth. Zero stock market appreciation. Or that the global economy, imperiled by a group of collective zeroes, faced an imminent meltdown that would wipe out millions of people financially---myself included. Given my unique perch, perhaps I should have. But wealth and excess have a blinding effect, especially amid the kind of greedfest that comes along only once every thousand years.\"Randall Lane never set out to become a Wall Street power broker. But during the decade he calls the Zeroes. he started a small magazine company that put him near the white-hot center of the biggest boom in history. Almost by accident. A man who drove a beat-up Subaru and lived in a rented walk-up became the go-to guy for big shots with nine-figure incomes.Lane's saga began with a simple idea: a glossy magazine exclusively for and about traders. which would treat them like rock stars and entice them to splurge on luxury goods. Trader Monthly was an instant hit around the world. Wall Streeters loved the spotlight. and advertisers like Gulfstream. Maybach, and Bulgari loved the marketing opportunity.To accelerate the buzz, Lane's staff threw parties featuring celebrities, premium steaks, cigars, and top-shelf vodka. Nothing was too expensive or too outrageous. Private jets in Napa Valley. Casino nights in London. And $1,000-a-seat boxing matches in New York, where traders from Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns pounded each other in front of tuxedoed throngs.Before long, Wall Street's rich and powerful trusted Lane as a fellow insider---the guy who could turn an anonymous trader into a cover model and media darling. And the rest of the world sought him out as a way to tap into Wall Street's riches. As he emptied his bank account to help keep his little company afloat, he became a nexus for the absurd. Traders who turned 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina into multimillion-dollar wind-falls. John McCain closing out the craps tables during an all-night gambling binge. Pop artist Peter Max hustling hundreds of thousands of dollars by selling traders almost paint-by-numbers portraits. Al Gore, John Travolta, Moby. Corrupt Caribbean rulers, the mobsters from Goodfellas, the pope. And a retired baseball star turned market guru---Lenny Dykstra---whose rise and fall was a great metaphor for the decade. All played roles in Lane's increasingly surreal world.When the crash of 2008 hit, lane's company and life savings were destroyed along with the high-flying traders and dealmakers his magazines exalted. But Lane walked away with something more lasting; an incredible true story.People will turn to The Zeroes for many years to come to find out what the era was really like.",

        "Description": "For two centuries Asians have been bystanders in world history, reacting defenselessly to the surges of Western commerce, thought, and power. That era is over. Asia is returning to the center stage it occupied for eighteen centuries before the rise of the West.By 2050, three of the world's largest economies will be Asian: China, India, and Japan. In The New Asian Hemisphere, Kishore Mahbubani argues that Western minds need to step outside their ?comfort zone' and prepare new mental maps to understand the rise of Asia. The West, he says, must gracefully share power with Asia by giving up its automatic domination of global institutions from the IMF to the World Bank, from the G7 to the UN Security Council. Only then will the new Asian powers reciprocate by becoming responsible stakeholders in a stable world order.",

Sally a debutante; Upton a classics major from Harvard, they met at the Boston Cotillion. He was articulate, witty, and worldly, and he danced like Fred Astaire. How could she resist? Despite raising four children on Upton\u2019s modest wage as the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic Monthly Press, theirs was a world of champagne, sailboats, private islands, famous writers, family rituals, and ice-cold martinis. They lived life on their terms. But as time wore on, Upton, the charming and brilliant husband, the inventive, beguiling partner, grew opinionated, cranky, controlling, and dangerous. When Upton died suddenly one evening in their Vermont cottage, Sally began uncovering secrets. As she went through his papers, she discovered that her husband of forty-six years had desired the love of other men. Her riveting, charismatic husband was not quite the man he appeared to be, and a year of mourning became for Sally a time to unravel the dark and unexpected web he had left behind. Hers is a moving and powerful story of coming to terms with what cannot be changed. It is also a story of great love.",

But where, in all this digital innovation, is the future of great journalism? Is there a difference between an opinion column and a blog, a reporter and a social networker? Who curates the news, or should it be streamed unimpeded by editorial influence? Expanding on Andrew Rossi&#39;s &#147;riveting\u201d film (Slate), David Folkenflik has convened some of the smartest media savants to talk about the present and the future of news. Behind all the debate is the presence of the New York Times, and the inside story of its attempt to navigate the new world, embracing the immediacy of the web without straying from a commitment to accurate reporting and analysis that provides the paper with its own definition of what it is there to showcase: all the news that&#39;s fit to print.",

        "Description": "Continuing the personal saga begun in the National Book Award-winning Waiting for Snow in Havana, the inspiring,\u00a0sad,\u00a0funny, bafflingly beautiful story of a boy uprooted by the Cuban Revolution and transplanted to Miami during the years of the Kennedy administration.In his 2003 National Book Award\u2013winning memoir Waiting for Snow in Havana, Carlos Eire narrated his coming of age in Cuba just before and during the Castro revolution. That book literally ends in midair as eleven-year-old Carlos and his older brother leave Havana on an airplane\u2014along with thousands of other children\u2014to begin their new life in Miami in 1962. It would be years before he would see his mother again. He would never again see his beloved father. Learning to Die in Miami opens as the plane lands and Carlos faces, with trepidation and excitement, his new life. He quickly realizes that in order for his new American self to emerge, his Cuban self must \u201cdie.\u201d And so, with great enterprise and purpose, he begins his journey. We follow Carlos as he adjusts to life in his new home. Faced with learning English, attending American schools, and an uncertain future, young Carlos confronts the age-old immigrant\u2019s plight: being surrounded by American bounty, but not able to partake right away. The abundance America has to offer excites him and, regardless of how grim his living situation becomes, he eagerly forges ahead with his own personal assimilation program, shedding the vestiges of his old life almost immediately, even changing his name to Charles. Cuba becomes a remote and vague idea in the back of his mind, something he used to know well, but now it \u201chad ceased to be part of the world.\u201d But as Carlos comes to grips with his strange surroundings, he must also struggle with everyday issues of growing up. His constant movement between foster homes and the eventual realization that his parents are far away in Cuba bring on an acute awareness that his life has irrevocably changed. Flashing back and forth between past and future, we watch as Carlos balances the divide between his past and present homes and finds his way in this strange new world, one that seems to hold the exhilarating promise of infinite possibilities and one that he will eventually claim as his own. An exorcism and an ode, Learning to Die in Miami is a celebration of renewal\u2014of those times when we\u2019re certain we have died and then are somehow, miraculously, reborn.",

        "Authors": "By Wright, Robin B.",
        "Description": "An up-close portrait of the ongoing internal struggle by secular and religious moderates to rescue Islam from the small, violent, and virulent minority that threatens it.A decade after the 9/11 attacks, this groundbreaking book by a preeminent reporter takes readers deep into the struggle within the Muslim world where a growing movement defies and challenges extremism and repudiates Osama bin Laden, his deviant doctrine, and his violent disciples. Robin Wright, an acclaimed foreign correspondent and television commentator, has witnessed the angry birth, violent rise, and globalization of Islamic militancy for almost four decades. In her recent reporting, she discovers a stunning new trend spreading within the Muslim world\u2014the rejection of Islamic extremists. This is a historic evolution, slow to take off but now reaching critical mass. This trend is increasingly visible as clerics publicly repudiate Osama bin Laden, Muslim comedians ridicule militancy altogether, young Muslims rap against guns and bombs, women scholars launch liberation movements using the Koran, Pakistani villagers resist Taliban intrusions, and former Egyptian jihadis debate and then denounce violence. This new jihad, which Wright describes in its many manifestations, has various goals.\u00a0For some Muslims, it\u2019s about reforming the faith. For others, it\u2019s about reforming political systems. For all, it is about achieving basic rights\u2014on their own terms, not Western ones. What is at its heart is the rejection of venomous ideologies, suicide bombs, plane hijackings, hostage-takings, and mass violence. Muslims, Wright demonstrates, are doing what the West cannot\u2014confronting extremism on its own terms and rescuing the faith from a virulent minority and changing history.",

        "Description": "Since his boyhood in Qadhafi &#39;s Libya, and later as a reporter for more than thirteen years in cities stretching from Tehran to Marrakesh, Neil MacFarquhar has developed a counterintuitive sense that the Middle East, despite all the bloodshed in its contemporary history, is a place of warmth, humanity, and generous eccentricity. In The Media Relations Department of Hizbollah Wishes You a Happy Birthday MacFarquhar shares a lesser known side of the region, the story he always wanted to file. MacFarquhar shows the daily lives and attitudes of people frequently obscured behind the curtain of violence: the stories of chefs and sex therapists, bloggers and academics struggling to reform on their own terms.",

        "Authors": "By Hussain, Zahid",
        "Description": "The war in Afghanistan has raged on longer than any war in U.S. history, and far from suppressing the insurgency being waged by radical Islamic militants, it has led to stronger alli\u00adances among al Qaeda, the Taliban, and a host of once-autonomous militant groups and has inspired a flood of new recruits. In addition to reclaiming control of substantial territory in Afghanistan, the militants have now taken the fight deep within Pakistan\u2014threatening to totally destabilize that nuclear-armed state\u2014and are launching attacks on the U.S. homeland. Why has the insurgency been so irrepressible? Is this a war that can be won? Can we expect a wave of attacks within the United States more sophisticated than the attempted bombing in Times Square? Nothing can be understood about the prospects for the war and the threat to the U.S. homeland without understanding how Pakistan has become the epicenter of the insurgency and why the rise of militant groups there has escalated out of control despite major offensives by the Pakistani military and an intensive secret U.S. Predator drone war against them. Based on extensive reporting inside Pakistan\u2019s dangerous lawless regions and exclusive interviews with militant leaders as well as high-level military and intelligence sources, Zahid Hussain, one of the most respected reporters working out of Pakistan, chronicles how and why the Islamic extremist groups based in Pakistan\u2019s remote tribal territories have greatly increased their power since the start of the war and unleashed a reign of terror on U.S. forces in Afghanistan and on both the military and civilian population within Pakistan. He is the first to reveal how a loose constellation of tribal groups has now come together to form a distinctive Pakistani Taliban, working closely with al Qaeda and the Afghani Taliban to launch increas\u00adingly sophisticated and deadly attacks on both sides of the Af-Pak border. He discloses how they draw support and a steady flood of recruits from deeply entrenched support networks in major Pakistani cities, and how they have recruited would-be U.S. attackers, including Faisal Shahzad and Adnan Shukrijumah, accused of plotting to bomb the New York City subway. He is also the first to chronicle in detail the still unacknowledged U.S. war carried out in Pakistan by remote Predator drones, and, reporting from the scenes of a number of drone missile strikes and interviewing a number of attempted suicide bombers, he reveals the shocking extent of anti-Americanism the strikes have stoked in Pakistan, across the range of the population, due to civilian deaths, driving a new breed of highly educated, professional, and middle-class Pakistanis into the militant groups. His gripping and revelatory account is an urgent wake-up call about the blowback effects of the U.S. war in Afghanistan and the drone campaign in Pakistan, about how volatile the situation in the Af-Pak region has become, and about the deeply troubling limitations of the current military strategy in ever gaining decisive ground against the insurgents.",

Twenty-one years ago, diplomat Angela Morgan witnessed the death of her husband during the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. Devastated by her loss, she fled back to America, where she hid in the backwaters of the State Department and avoided the high-profile postings that would advance her career. Now, with that career about to dead-end and no true connections at home, she must take the one assignment available-at a remote British army outpost in northern Afghanistan. Unwelcome among the soldiers and unaccepted by the local government and warlords, Angela has to fight to earn the respect of her colleagues, especially the enigmatic Mark Davies, a British major who is by turns her staunchest ally and her fiercest critic. Frustrated at her inability to contribute to the nation's reconstruction, Angela slips out of camp disguised in a burka to provide aid to the refugees in the war-torn region. She becomes their farishta, or \"angel,\" in the local Dari language-and discovers a new purpose for her life, a way to finally put her grief behind her. Drawing on the experiences of the author as a diplomat in Afghanistan, Farishta is a deeply moving and fast-paced story of a woman struggling to move beyond a past trauma, and finding a new community, a new love, and a new sense of self in the process.",

        "Description": "\"The poignant story of a son's attempt to understand his father's life by sharing the sport that once drove them apart. When Steve Friedman was a child growing up in the suburbs of St. Louis, the game of golf was, to him, mysterious and dark. His father's passion for it caused friction in his marriage and eluded the interest of his youngest son, who was devoted instead to basketball. For that and many other reasons, the two failed to bond, ultimately leading to an awkward and unhappy relationship. But Friedman never forgot the love his father had for golf, and after many years, when he was in his forties, he reached out and asked his dad to teach him the game. He thought that perhaps he could learn something about his old man's view of life and thereby find a way to communicate with him. This small volume is the sweet yet unsentimental story of that experience--the tale of two men using the game of golf to find a way to connect with each other across decades of disagreement and misunderstanding. For anyone who is a golfer, a father, or a son, this book will be a treasure\"--",

Enter Edward Day, who wants more than anything to move an unsuspecting audience to an experience of emotional truth. But he must also contend with the drama of his own life: he is locked in a bitter rivalry with fellow actor Guy Margate, with whom he shares a marked physical resemblance and a fatal attraction to the beautiful, talented, and all-too-available Madeleine Delavergne. Edward\u2019s pursuit of Madeleine is complicated by the fact that he owes Guy his life. In this riveting tale of paranoia, passion, jealousy, and relentless ambition, Edward will learn that the truth, in the theater as in life, is ever elusive and never inert.",
