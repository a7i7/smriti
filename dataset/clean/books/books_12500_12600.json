        "Description": "In these unforgettable stories, the acclaimed author of Imagine Me Gone\u00a0explores lives that appear shuttered by loss and discovers entire worlds hidden inside them. The impact is at once harrowing and thrilling. An elderly inventor, burning with manic creativity, tries to reconcile with his estranged gay son. A bereaved boy draws a thuggish classmate into a relationship of escalating guilt and violence. A genteel middle-aged woman, a long-time resident of a psychiatric hospital, becomes the confidante of a lovelorn teenaged volunteer. Told with Chekhovian restraint and compassion, and conveying both the sorrow of life and the courage with which people rise to meet it,\u00a0You Are Not a Stranger Here\u00a0is a triumph of storytelling.",

        "Title": "The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy",
        "Authors": "By Greider, William",
        "Description": "In his previous bestsellers, Who Will Tell the People and Secrets of the Temple, William Greider laid bare the inner workings of American politics and the Federal Reserve, revealing how they often work against the interests of the majority. Now, in The Soul of Capitalism, Greider examines how the greatest wealth-creation engine in the history of the world is failing most of us, why it must be changed, and how intrepid pioneers are beginning to transform it.   Public outrage over crooked corporate officers, the looting of pension funds, the defrauding of stockholders, and the wholesale firing of hardworking employees has reached a new high. But Greider argues that our anger has deeper roots, as he analyzes how our relentless pursuit of unprecedented affluence has eroded family life, eaten away at our sense of personal and professional security, corroded our communities, impoverished our spiritual lives, and devastated our natural environment. The solution, he contends, will come not from activist government,  the politics of the past, or more government regulation (the usual response of liberals), but from a fundamental realignment of power that, he promises, is already under way on many fronts.  The Soul of Capitalism shows us where to find the leverage for changing the system. Reformers appear in surprising variety, from conservative business managers to small-town civic leaders, social agitators and ecologists, labor leaders and farmers. Greider offers many up-and-running examples -- of workers becoming owners, of pension funds withdrawing their capital from polluters, of small companies learning how to operate profitably while caring for employees and the environment, of governments reforming their public works.   Brilliantly perceptive and sweeping in its ambition, The Soul of Capitalism is also hardheaded and practical as one of our most eloquent populist spokesmen assures us why we are not powerless. Greider illustrates how American capitalism can be aligned more faithfully and obediently with what people want and need in their lives, with what American society needs for a healthy, balanced, and humane future. He proves that it is within our power to reinvent capitalism to make it work for us.  The Soul of Capitalism -- solid, pragmatic, visionary, optimistic -- addresses the nation's most urgent needs.",

Now, inThe Rainmaker, Grisham returns to the courtroom for the first time since A Time To Kill, and weaves a riveting tale of legal intrigue and corporate greed. Combining suspense, narrative momentum, and humor as only John Grisham can, this is another spellbinding read from the most popular author of our time.Grisham's sixth spellbinding novel of legal intrigue and corporate greed displays all of the intricate plotting, fast-paced action, humor, and suspense that have made him the most popular author of our time. In his first courtroom thriller since A Time To Kill, John Grisham tells the story of a young man barely out of law school who finds himself taking on one of the most powerful, corrupt, and ruthless companies in America -- and exposing a complex, multibillion-dollar insurance scam. In hs final semester of law school Rudy Baylor is required to provide free legal advice to a group of senior citizens, and it is there that he meets his first \"clients,\" Dot and Buddy Black. Their son, Donny Ray, is dying of leukemia, and their insurance company has flatly refused to pay for his medical treatments. While Rudy is at first skeptical, he soon realizes that the Blacks really have been shockingly mistreated by the huge company, and that he just may have stumbled upon one of the largest insurance frauds anyone's ever seen -- and one of the most lucrative and important cases in the history of civil litigation. The problem is, Rudy's flat broke, has no job, hasn't even passed the bar, and is about to go head-to-head with one of the best defense attorneys -- and powerful industries -- in America.",

A terrorist attack on a military convoy leaves scores of soldiers dead as truckloads of highly volatile weapons fall into the hands of an ultra-right-wing militia. A fanatic, snake-handling preacher known only as Brother Transgressor joins forces with the radical group, adding fuel to the fire. No one knows who this mysterious figure is or where he came from, but few can resist his ardent convictions - or see that his persuasive ways conceal his own dark secrets and sinister agenda.Having just won a landmark conviction, Martin Vail - now Illinois attorney general - has risen to national prominence. His bravado and cunning reputation catch the attention of the Oval Office. The President demands swift legal action against the militia and turns to Vail, naming him an assistant attorney general of the United States. His job: nail the terrorists in their tracks. Still hungry as ever to make up for the fatal mistakes he made years ago, Vail plunges into his new, near-impossible mission, one that soon explodes into a personal nightmare, as his most chilling adversary, Aaron Stampler, returns - seemingly from the dead - to enact a vengeance that might bring Vail to his knees.",

But even he is startled by the violence that erupts when a hard, fast rule is broken: Never pick up a hitchhiker.In what will be the first of many ironies, the passenger - not the driver - turns up dead. And if one corpse is bad for business, what happens next could well be fatal: Freddie is swept unknowingly into the vortex of a malign conspiracy in which appearances deceive and the cost of being duped is murderously high. Tilting at the shifting shadows cast by his elusive adversaries, he must summon up extraordinary guile and courage to protect his enterprise - and save his life.Driving Force is Dick Francis at his most tantalizingly complex and dramatically propulsive - the kind of top-drawer suspense no aficionado can resist.",

        "Description": "Crime begins in the mind.Through seven successive bestsellers, child psychologist Jonathan Kellerman has used his intimate knowledge of human nature to create some of the most brilliantly deceptive, emotionally gripping storylines in suspense fiction today. Now his psychologist-detective Dr. Alex Delaware become caught up in a case as chilling and harrowing as any he has ever faced.Twenty-one-month-old Cassie Jones is bright, energetic, and as perfect to look at as a porcelain doll. But her pediatrician, Dr. Stephanie Eves, is baffled and disturbed at the ordeal that has dominated her young patient's life. Over the past eighteen months, Cassie has been rushed to the emergency room at Western Pediatrics Hospital with alarming frequency, suffering from a variety of medical symptoms. Each time Cassie is admitted, Dr. Eves struggles to come up with a diagnosis. Each time she fails. In the wake of yet another crisis, she calls in her old friend and colleague, Dr. Alex Delaware.Although there is no concrete evidence, Alex's instinct tells him someone is deliberately attempting to make Cassie ill. To his horror, heading up the list of suspects are Cassie's parents, Chip and Cindy Jones. But when he meets the pair, he finds an attractive, caring couple - loving parents, helpless and frightened, reaching out for the answer to their daughter's tribulations. And the more time Alex spends at Western Pediatrics, the more convinced he becomes that something very disturbing is going on in the hospital itself.Years ago Alex had begun his career at Western Peds, but the place to which he returns makes him feel like a stranger: security is being enforced by a squadron of stony-faced centurions. Doctors and nurses are demoralized and are leaving in droves. A dark wariness pervades a once upbeat place, perhaps brought on by the hospital's crushing financial problems. And the newly appointed financial savior is Chuck Jones, a brilliant money-man - and Cassie Jones's grandfather.Then, even as Cassie suffers another setback, as staff physician is brutally murdered and Alex begins to connect the threads linking the shadowy machinations at Western Peds with the fate of a child. But he knows that he and his friend, police detective Milo Sturgis, have precious little time to identify the diabolical mentality that is always one tantalizing step ahead of them.In Devil's Waltz, Jonathan Kellerman has created one of his most satisfying novels yet, a powerful portrait of deceit, as shocking as it is hauntingly real, and a compelling novel of men and women struggling to save lives in the face of unparalleled evil.",

When eaten, it causes the taste buds to experience all food eaten afterwards\u2014even distasteful food\u2014as sweet and delicious. There are people who, through their love and compassion, make the lives of those with whom they come in contact better. Like the taste-berry, these people can turn a sour day into a joyful adventure. In a time when many of us have stopped believing in the goodness of humanity, we need to remind ourselves that though there is dissonance in the world, there is even more peace, kindness and love. In Taste-Berry Tales, Bettie B. Youngs inspires readers with 25 poignant short stories of real-life people who make a difference in the lives of others. These individuals, by their example, show us how to use the events of daily life to improve the world we live in and the lives of others with whom we share it. When we help others by sharing the sweetness of life's joys and easing the bitterness of its losses, we become, in the best sense of the words, \"our brothers' keepers.\" Youngs plays this role for readers, showing them a world that is full of hope. Everyone who reads this book will discover that their dreams are not only possible, but also more glorious than they ever realized.",

        "Description": "Reverend Theodora Braithwaite \"has the potential to grow into [a Father Dowling]\" says the Washington Times of England's divinely clever amateur sleuth, who arrives at the rural cathedral of Bow St. Aelfric to find it a maelstrom of petty clerical politics. The parish has a history of nasty clashes between the townspeople and the clergy, and with an unpleasant new dean assuming control of the cathedral, the age-old feud is poised to re-ignite.The spark comes in the form of a statue - an ancient pagan idol unearthed on church property. With a face on both the front and the back of his head, Janus is the Roman god of gateways, of beginnings and ends. His sudden appearance marks the reawakening of the town's interest in paganism, and proves the end of Dean Vincent Stream, who is murdered at the idol's feet. It falls to Theodora to discover who would offer such a sacrifice, and the canny sleuth is more inclined to look for enemies of the unpopular dean than for pagan worshippers gone awry.Unfortunately, the dean's enemies are many, and Theodora finds herself confronted with a Canon of questionable sanity, squatters with revenge on their minds, and an anonymous journalist whose poison pen draws blood with every word. With the future of both town and church depending on her success, the Reverend races to find out whose grudge has led to such violence - before it erupts again.",

Filled with charming anecdotes, a year's worth of news from the grapevine, and imaginative menus and recipes, this is a delightful window into her life as wine lover, epicure, philosopher, and hostess.  Vintage Feasting  February 14. The vineyards are asleep. Our Valentine's Day feast is fresh, cracked Dungeness crab soup cooked with Fum\u00e9 Blanc, served with garlic mayonnaise and bubbly....  In settings suffused with the scents of Giverny-like gardens, Joy shares secrets of tasting and cooking with wine, reveals her own experiments with menus and vintages, and explains why certain pairings of food and wine endure. And she exults in life's surprises, like the magical cluster of rare morels that appeared one day under a century-old Douglas fir and became an exotic ragout.  Whether it's savoring the intense aromas of crushed violets in a young Cabernet Sauvignon; recalling a culinary adventure at Paul Bocuse's restaurant; drinking in the Provence scents of zinnias and lavenders; or concocting a Halloween dinner of turban squash, Vintage Feasting is a treasure of fascinating lore, succulent menus, memorable wines -- and a zest for enjoying life that leaves us refreshed, delighted, and inspired anew.",

Tanks have been essential components of armies for decades and modern armies rely on them to provide both the knockout punch on the battlefield and to give backbone to infantry operations. Modern tanks have been refined and updated to withstand the multitudes of anti-tank weaponry deployed against them and include technological advances that would amaze the tank's original developers. The latest designs sport composite armor, jamming systems, advanced sights and laser range-finding gear, 120mm guns, anti-personnel machine-guns and light mortars. This revised and updated edition includes entries on America's M1A1, France's Leclerc, Germany's Leopard 2, Britain's Challenger 2, Iraq's T-55, Israel's Merkava, Russia's T-90, China's Norinco and others from across the world. Each entry includes a detailed line profile, photos for identification, a description of the key features and detailed technical specifications. The fully-illustrated information in Battle Tanks is a valuable guide to the tanks of the world.",

        "Description": "Resurrecting Mingus is the story of a young woman lost -- striving to find her own identity while dealing with powerful and painful questions that force her to confront everything and everyone that matters to her. In this stunning debut novel, Jenoyne Adams, a PEN Center USA West Emerging Voices Fellow, displays a rare talent for a first-time author: the skill and courage to write about some of the most controversial issues today in an absorbing and compulsively readable manner.  Mingus Browning is a successful, young, beautiful lawyer whose life is falling apart. After a thirty-five-year marriage, Mingus's African-American father has suddenly left her Irish mother for a black woman. A daddy's girl, Mingus is torn between the father she has always been closer to, the mother she may have to defend in divorce proceedings, and a sister hell-bent on winning their lifelong sibling rivalry. Mingus is caught in middle of the three, a woman alone, and, in turn, realizes that she has probably always felt more comfortable that way because she is part of no one group, let alone a united family. Juggling her parents' grief with her own proves to be too much for Mingus as she stumbles from one questionable relationship to another, further complicating her life.  After years of isolating herself from those who have tried to care for her, Mingus finally meets someone who rips through her protective defenses and exposes her need to be loved. Eric Simms, a smooth-talking television producer, is through playing dating games and is looking for love for real this time. With Eric, Mingus finally learns to forget the fear of a broken heart and opens herself completely. That is, until word starts circulating that her new love has his secrets as well, and suddenly what was a perfect relationship begins to look like yet another minefield of hurt, as Mingus is forced to choose between her man, her sister, and the truth.  After facing a long, sad string of heartaches and betrayals, Mingus finally reaches the point in her life where she realizes who she is, what she wants, and how she doesn't need another man to get it. Marked by raw images and poetic prose, Jenoyne Adams's affecting first novel candidly explores the bonds of family, faith, and finding someone to love when you can't even find someone to trust.",

You've tried diets recommended by doctors, models, actresses, or tabloids. But the pounds don't melt away like they're supposed to, and, even worse, they come back fast.Bodystat can change all that. How? Not by changing the size of your dinner plate or how many times you chew your food or by sending you off to buy food you never heard of, but by changing your understanding of food and how your body uses it. In Bodystat, authors Eric Witt and Carol Wirth explain in clear, easy-to-understand language the scientific principles underlying the \"set point\" at which the body begins to resist fat loss, and how it can be reset. It's not time-consuming, expensive, complicated, or painful. In fact, it's as simple as low-fat eating and moderate exercise. Yes, you've heard that before, but here the authors walk you through how to understand labels, menus, and all that confusing exercise advice, so you can develop your own plan for lowering your fat \"set point.\" Best of all, they offer lots of choices that you can tailor to your own preferences and habits.Eric and Carol know their advice can help you, because it has helped so many of their friends and workshop participants. Carol's colleagues kept asking her how she could eat so much and look so good. They didn't know that Carol had yo-yoed for years while trying fad diets before she and Eric researched developing a healthier lifestyle that would work for them. Soon they were advising friends, then giving popular workshops, and now are sharing their ideas in Bodystat. They've included dozens of practical tips, twenty-seven of their favorite recipes, and, most important, the principles about diet and exercise that will empower you to be healthier and happier with your body - forever. You don't have to try to follow day-by-day diets full of food you hate or diagrammed exercises you can't figure out. With Bodystat you will see the big picture - and smile!",

        "Description": "HOW HAD MRS. OLINSKI CHOSEN her sixth-grade Academic Bowl team? She had a number of answers. But were any of them true? How had she really chosen Noah and Nadia and Ethan and Julian? And why did they make such a good team? It was a surprise to a lot of people when Mrs. Olinski's team won the sixth-grade Academic Bowl contest at Epiphany Middle School. It was an even bigger surprise when they beat the seventh grade and the eighth grade, too. And when they went on to even greater victories, everyone began to ask: How did it happen? It happened at least partly because Noah had been the best man (quite by accident) at the wedding of Ethan's grandmother and Nadia's grandfather. It happened because Nadia discovered that she could not let a lot of baby turtles die. It happened when Ethan could not let Julian face disaster alone. And it happened because Julian valued something important in himself and saw in the other three something he also valued. Mrs. Olinski, returning to teaching after having been injured in an automobile accident, found that her Academic Bowl team became her answer to finding confidence and success. What she did not know, at least at first, was that her team knew more than she did the answer to why they had been chosen. This is a tale about a team, a class, a school, a series of contests and, set in the midst of this, four jewel-like short stories -- one for each of the team members -- that ask questions and demonstrate surprising answers.",
