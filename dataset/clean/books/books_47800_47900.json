        "Description": "Carrie Montgomery had grown up with seven adoring older brothers, and she was used to getting her way rather easily. Joshua Greene was only looking for a hardworking, practical mail-order bride to help with the farm and feed and clothe his children. Yet from the moment Carrie saw his photograph, saw his devastatingly handsome, sorrowful smile, the petite and pampered beauty knew she was the perfect wife for him.  Josh didn't see it that way. Wed by proxy, he refused to be charmed by his new bride's blond curls and effervescent laughter, or impressed by her trappings of wealth...even if his son and daughter believed she was a fairy princess come to life. He was furious -- and ready to send her packing, until a near tragedy convinced him that her beauty was more than skin-deep. But even after he had yielded to the wild desire that surged between them, Josh could not admit how much he truly needed her. Then an old scandal threatened to re-emerge, and he realized that he could lose her forever....",

Beyond the castle walls, none knew that the youngest Peregrine was a girl....  Yet when the magnificent Knight Tearle Howard returned from a lengthy sojourn in France, it took him but one glance to discover that Zared was most definitely female, and beautiful. Now, as the enmity between their families raged on, Tearle would mount a bold campaign to win the ravishing spitfire's heart -- and save her from his brother's dark and deadly obsession!",

        "Title": "Cornerstone of Liberty: Property Rights in 21st Century America",
        "Authors": "By Sandefur, Timothy",
        "Description": "The right to own and use private property is among the most essential human rights and the essential basis for economic growth. That's why America's Founders guaranteed it in the Constitution. Yet in today's America, government tramples on this right in countless ways. Regulations forbid people to use their property as they wish, bureaucrats extort enormous fees from developers in exchange for building permits, and police departments snatch personal belongings on the suspicion that they were involved in crimes. In the case of Kelo v. New London, the Supreme Court even declared that government may seize homes and businesses and transfer the land to private developers to build stores, restaurants, or hotels. That decision was met with a firestorm of criticism across the nation. In this, the first book on property rights to be published since the Kelo decision, Timothy Sandefur surveys the landscape of private property in America's third century. Beginning with the role property rights play in human nature, Sandefur describes how America's Founders wrote a Constitution that would protect this right and details the gradual erosion that began with the Progressive Era's abandonment of the principles of individual liberty. Sandefur tells the gripping stories of people who have found their property threatened: Frank Bugryn and his Connecticut Christmas-tree farm; Susette Kelo and the little dream house she renovated; Wilhelmina Dery and the house she was born in, 80 years before bureaucrats decided to take it; Dorothy English and the land she wanted to leave to her children; and Kenneth Healing and his 17-year legal battle for permission to build a home. Thanks to the abuse of eminent domain and asset forfeiture laws, federal, state, and local governments have now come to see property rights as mere permissions, which can be revoked at any time in the name of the greater good. In this book, Sandefur explains what citizens can do to restore the Constitution's protections for this cornerstone of liberty.",

        "Description": "Naples, Italy, during four fateful days in the fall of 1943. The only people left in the shattered, bombed-out city are the lost, abandoned children whose only goal is to survive another day. None could imagine that they would become fearless fighters and the unlikeliest heroes of World War II. They are the warriors immortalized in Street Boys, Lorenzo Carcaterra\u2019s exhilarating new novel, a book that exceeds even his bestselling Sleepers as a riveting reading experience.It\u2019s late September. The war in Europe is almost won. Italy is leaderless, Mussolini already arrested by anti-Fascists. The German army has evacuated the city of Naples. Adults, even entire families, have been marched off to work camps or simply sent off to their deaths. Now, the German army is moving toward Naples to finish the job. Their chilling instructions are: If the city can\u2019t belong to Hitler, it will belong to no one.No one but children. Children who have been orphaned or hidden by parents in a last, defiant gesture against the Nazis. Children, some as young as ten years old, armed with just a handful of guns, unexploded bombs, and their own ingenuity. Children who are determined to take on the advancing enemy and save the city\u2014or die trying.There is Vincenzo Soldari, a sixteen-year-old history buff who is determined to make history by leading others with courage and self-confidence; Carlo Maldini, a middle-aged drunkard desperate to redeem himself by adding his experience to the raw exuberance of the young fighters; Nunzia Maldini, his nineteen-year-old daughter, who helps her father regain his self-respect\u2014 and loses her heart to an American G.I.; Corporal Steve Connors, a soldier sent out on reconnaissance, then cut off from his comrades\u2014with no choice but to aid the street boys; Colonel Rudolph Van Klaus, the proud Nazi commander shamed by his own sadistic mission; and, of course, the dozens of young boys who use their few skills and great heart to try to save their city, their country, and themselves.In its compassionate portrait of the rootless young, and its pitiless portrayal of the violence that is at once their world and their way out, Street Boys continues and deepens Lorenzo Carcaterra\u2019s trademark themes. In its awesome scope and pure page-turning excitement, it stands as a stirring tribute to the underdog in us all\u2014and as a singular addition to the novels about World War II.",

With four World Series championships in five seasons and a deep bench of legends and comers -- Clemens, Rivera, Williams, Soriano, Jeter, O'Neill -- they dominated the major leagues.For the members of the team, though, baseball Yankees-style was a pressure cooker of anxiety, expectation, and infighting. As the spending and emotion spiraled, careers were made and broken, friendships began and ended, and a sports dynasty rose and fell.In The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty, Buster Olney tracks the Yankees through these tumultuous seasons and into the scandals and disappointments of 2004, providing insightful portraits of the stars, the foot soldiers, the coaches, the manager, and the Boss himself. With unparalleled knowledge of the game and an insider's familiarity with the team, Olney also advances a compelling argument that the philosophy that made the Yankees great was inherently unsustainable, ultimately harmful to the sport, and led inevitably to that warm autumn night in Arizona -- the last night of the Yankee dynasty.",

Now Bamford discloses inside, often shocking information about the transformation of the NSA in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 2001. In THE SHADOW FACTORY, Bamford shows how the NSA\u2019s failure to detect the presence of two of the 9/11 hijackers inside the United States led the NSA to abandon its long-held policy of spying only on enemies outside the country. Instead, after 9/11 it turned its almost limitless ability to listen in on friend and foe alike over to the Bush Administration to use as a weapon in the war on terror. With unrivaled access to sources and documents, Bamford details how the agency has conducted domestic surveillance without court approval, and he frames it in the context of the NSA\u2019s ongoing hunt for information about today\u2019s elusive enemies. THE SHADOW FACTORY is a riveting read for anyone concerned about civil liberties and America\u2019s security in the post-9/11 world.",

Whether investigating a case or a problem of philosophy, the indefatigable Isabel Dalhousie, one of fiction\u2019s most richly developed amateur detectives, is always ready to pursue the answers to all of life\u2019s questions, large and small.In the fabulous new installment in the best-selling adventures of Isabel Dalhousie,  Isabel is asked to help a doctor who has been disgraced by allegations of scientific  fraud concerning a newly marketed drug.  Our ever-curious moral philosopher finds  her interest piqued.  Would a doctor with a stellar reputation make such a simple  but grave mistake?  If not, what explains the tragic accident that resulted in the  death of a patient?  Clearly, an investigation is in order, especially since a man's  reputation is in jeopardy.  Could he be the victim of someone else's mistake?  Or  perhaps he has been willfully deceived by a pharmaceutical company with a great deal  to gain.  Not every problem prompts an investigation (take, for example, her ongoing  struggle with her housekeeper, Grace, over the care of Isabel's infant son, Charlie),  but, as we've seen, whatever the case, whatever the solution, Isabel's combination  of spirit, smarts, empathy, and unabashed nosiness guarantees a delightful adventure.",

        "Description": "The personally revealing and complete biography of the man known everywhere as \u201cThe Oracle of Omaha\u201d\u2014for fans\u00a0of the HBO documentary\u00a0Becoming Warren BuffettHere is the book recounting the life and times of one of the most respected men in  the world, Warren Buffett. The legendary Omaha investor has never written a memoir,  but now he has allowed one writer, Alice Schroeder, unprecedented access to explore  directly with him and with those closest to him his work, opinions, struggles, triumphs,  follies, and wisdom. Although the media track him  constantly, Buffett himself has never told his full life story. His reality is private,  especially by celebrity standards. Indeed, while the homespun persona that the public  sees is true as far as it goes, it goes only so far. Warren Buffett is an array of  paradoxes. He set out to prove that nice guys can finish first. Over the years he  treated his investors as partners, acted as their steward, and championed honesty  as an investor, CEO, board member, essayist, and speaker. At the same time he became  the world\u2019s richest man, all from the modest Omaha headquarters of his company Berkshire  Hathaway. None of this fits the term \u201csimple.\u201d When Alice Schroeder met Warren Buffett  she was an insurance industry analyst and a gifted writer known for her keen perception  and business acumen. Her writings on finance impressed him, and as she came to know  him she realized that while much had been written on the subject of his investing  style, no one had moved beyond that to explore his larger philosophy, which is bound  up in a complex personality and the details of his life. Out of this came his decision  to cooperate with her on the book about himself that he would never write. Never  before has Buffett spent countless hours responding to a writer\u2019s questions, talking,  giving complete access to his wife, children, friends, and business associates\u2014opening  his files, recalling his childhood. It was an act of courage, as The Snowball makes  immensely clear. Being human, his own life, like most lives, has been a mix of strengths  and frailties. Yet notable though his wealth may be, Buffett\u2019s legacy will not be  his ranking on the scorecard of wealth; it will be his principles and ideas that  have enriched people\u2019s lives. This book tells you why Warren Buffett is the most  fascinating American success story of our time.Praise for The Snowball\u201cEven people who don't care a whit about business will be intrigued by this portrait. . . . Schroeder, a former insurance-industry analyst, spent years interviewing Buffett, and the result is a side of the Oracle of Omaha that has rarely been seen.\u201d\u2014Time\u201cWill mesmerize anyone interested in who Mr. Buffett is or how he got that way.\u00a0The Snowball\u00a0tells a fascinating story.\u201d\u2014New York Times\u201cIf the replication of any great achievement first requires knowledge of how it was done, then\u00a0The Snowball, the most detailed glimpse inside Warren Buffett and his world that we likely will ever get, should become a Bible for capitalists.\u201d\u2014Washington Post\u201cRiveting and encyclopedic.\u201d\u2014Wall Street Journal\u201cA monumental biography . . .

With the new states unable to support their ex-soldiers, the Maycotts make a desperate gamble: trade the chance of future payment for the hope of a better life on the western Pennsylvania frontier. There, amid hardship and deprivation, they find unlikely friendship and a chance for prosperity with a new method of distilling whiskey. But on an isolated frontier, whiskey is more than a drink; it is currency and power, and the Maycotts\u2019 success attracts the brutal attention of men in Hamilton\u2019s orbit, men who threaten to destroy all Joan holds dear.As their causes intertwine, Joan and Saunders\u2013both patriots in their own way\u2013find themselves on opposing sides of a daring scheme that will forever change their lives and their new country.

Picnic, Lightning--one of the books that helped establish and secure his reputation and popularity during the 1990s--combines humor and seriousness, wit and sublimity.

        "Authors": "By Glass, Julia",
        "Description": "From the author of the best-selling Three Junes comes an intimate new work of fiction: a tale of two sisters, together and apart, told in their alternating voices over twenty-five years. Louisa Jardine is the older one, the conscientious student, precise and careful: the one who years for a good marriage, an artistic career, a family. Clem, the archetypal youngest, is the rebel: uncontainable, iconoclastic, committed to her work but not to the men who fall for her daring nature. Louisa resents that the charismatic Clem has always been the favorite; yet as Clem puts it, \u201cOn the other side of the fence\u2013mine\u2013every expectation you fulfill . . . puts you one stop closer to that Grand Canyon rim from which you could one day rule the world\u2013or plummet in very grand style.\u201d In this vivid, heartrending story of what we can and cannot do for those we love, the sisters grow closer as they move farther apart. Louis settles in New York while Clem, a wildlife biologist, moves restlessly about until she lands in the Rocky Mountains. Their complex bond, Louisa observes, is \u201clike a double helix, two souls coiling around a common axis, joined yet never touching.\u201dAlive with all the sensual detail and riveting characterization that mark Glass\u2019s previous work, I See You Everywhere is a piercingly candid story of life and death, companionship and sorrow, and the nature of sisterhood itself.",

        "Title": "Emily Post: Daughter of the Gilded Age, Mistress of American Manners",
        "Authors": "By Claridge, Laura",
        "Description": "\u201cWhat would Emily Post do?\u201d Even today, Americans cite the author of the perennial bestseller Etiquette as a touchstone for proper behavior. But who was the woman behind the myth, the authority on good manners who has outlasted all comers? Award-winning author Laura Claridge presents the first authoritative biography of the unforgettable woman who changed the mindset of millions of Americans, an engaging book that sweeps from the Gilded Age to the 1960s.Born shortly after the Civil War, Emily Post was a daughter of high society, the only child of an ambitious Baltimore architect, Bruce Price, and his wellborn wife. Within a few years of his daughter\u2019s birth, Price moved his family to New York City, where they mingled with the Roosevelts and the Astors as well as with the new crowd in town\u2013J. P. Morgan and the Vanderbilt clan. Blossoming into one of Manhattan\u2019s most sought-after debutantes, Emily went on to marry Edwin Post, planning to re-create in her own home the happiness she\u2019d observed between her parents. Instead, she would find herself in the middle of a scandalous divorce, its humiliating details splashed across the front pages of New York newspapers for months. Traumatic though it was, the end of her marriage forced Emily Post to become her own person. She would spend the next fifteen years writing novels and attending high-powered literary events alongside the likes of Mark Twain and Edith Wharton, but in middle age she decided she would try something different. When it debuted in 1922 with a tiny first print run, Etiquette represented a fifty-year-old woman at her wisest\u2013and a country at its wildest. Claridge addresses the secret of Etiquette\u2019s tremendous success and gives us a panoramic view of the culture from which Etiquette took its shape, as its author meticulously updated her book twice a decade to keep it consistent with America\u2019s constantly changing social landscape.A tireless advocate for middle-class and immigrant Americans, Emily Post became the emblem of a new kind of manners in which etiquette and ethics were forever entwined. Now, nearly fifty years after her death, we still feel her enormous influence on how we think Best Society should behave.Praise for Emily Post\u201cGiven the ubiquitousness of her repeatedly revised magnum opus, Etiquette, first published in 1922, we think of Emily Post as an institution rather than a human being.  But she was a woman of substance and sensitivity.  The first to fully portray this pioneer, Claridge is becoming the sort of biographer readers will follow anywhere, and one hopes she\u2019ll continue in the vein that yielded Norman Rockwell (2001) and now this absorbing study of a keenly perceptive ethicist second only to Eleanor Roosevelt in the immensity of her influence.  A child of privilege born in the wake of the Civil War, smart and beautiful Emily Price married a rascal.  The pain and humiliation of her divorce from Edwin Post fostered her devotion to writing (she was a successful novelist) and seeded the compassion and advocacy for women that shaped her highly moral approach to etiquette. Claridge chronicles Post\u2019s remarkable ability to discern the needs of a Claridge chronicles Post\u2019s remarkable ability to discern the needs of a burgeoning American public transformed by immigration, industrialization, war, and women\u2019s and civil rights, and hungry for guidance in social and familial situations.  A best-selling writer and hugely popular radio personality, Post equated etiquette with character and ensured a \u2018democratization of manners.\u2019  Claridge greatly deepens our appreciation for Post\u2019s achievements and brings forward the impressive woman behind the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts.\u201d ---Donna Seaman, Booklist (starred review)\u201cIt was the genius of Emily Post to show us that manners are the small coin of morality\u2026.Emily Post became perhaps the most im",

        "Title": "The Devil We Know: Dealing with the New Iranian Superpower",
        "Authors": "By Baer, Robert",
        "Description": "Over the past thirty years, while the United States has turned either a blind or dismissive eye, Iran has emerged as a nation every bit as capable of altering America\u2019s destiny as traditional superpowers Russia and China. Indeed, one of this book\u2019s central arguments is that, in some ways, Iran\u2019s grip on America\u2019s future is even tighter.As ex\u2013CIA operative Robert Baer masterfully shows, Iran has maneuvered itself into the elite superpower ranks by exploiting Americans\u2019 false perceptions of what Iran is\u2014by letting us believe it is a country run by scowling religious fanatics, too preoccupied with theocratic jostling and terrorist agendas to strengthen its political and economic foundations.The reality is much more frightening\u2014and yet contained in the potential catastrophe is an implicit political response that, if we\u2019re bold enough to adopt it, could avert disaster.Baer\u2019s on-the-ground sleuthing and interviews with key Middle East players\u2014everyone from an Iranian ayatollah to the king of Bahrain to the head of Israel\u2019s internal security\u2014paint a picture of the centuries-old Shia nation that is starkly the opposite of the one normally drawn. For example, Iran\u2019s hate-spouting President Ahmadinejad is by no means the true spokesman for Iranian foreign policy, nor is Iran making it the highest priority to become a nuclear player. Even so, Baer has discovered that Iran is currently engaged in a soft takeover of the Middle East, that the proxy method of war-making and co-option it perfected with Hezbollah in Lebanon is being exported throughout the region, that Iran now controls a significant portion of Iraq, that it is extending its influence over Jordan and Egypt, that the Arab Emirates and other Gulf States are being pulled into its sphere, and that it will shortly have a firm hold on the world\u2019s oil spigot.By mixing anecdotes with information gleaned from clandestine sources, Baer superbly demonstrates that Iran, far from being a wild-eyed rogue state, is a rational actor\u2014one skilled in the game of nations and so effective at thwarting perceived Western colonialism that even rival Sunnis relish fighting under its banner.For U.S. policy makers, the choices have narrowed: either cede the world\u2019s most important energy corridors to a nation that can match us militarily with its asymmetric capabilities (which include the use of suicide bombers)\u2014or deal with the devil we know. We might just find that in allying with Iran, we\u2019ll have increased not just our own security but that of all Middle East nations.The alternative\u2014to continue goading Iran into establishing hegemony over the Muslim world\u2014is too chilling to contemplate.",

At the edge of the continent, Crosby, Maine, may seem  like nowhere, but seen through this brilliant writer\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s in essence the  whole world, and the lives that are lived there are filled with all of the grand  human drama\u2013desire, despair, jealousy, hope, and love.

As the  townspeople grapple with their problems, mild and dire, Olive is brought to a deeper  understanding of herself and her life\u2013sometimes painfully, but always with ruthless  honesty.

        "Authors": "By Kennedy, Kerry",
        "Description": "For Kerry Kennedy, who grew up in a devoutly Catholic household coping with great loss, her family\u2019s faith was a constant source of strength and solace. As an adult, she came to question some of the attitudes and teachings of the Catholic Church while remaining an impassioned believer in its role as a defender of the poor and oppressed.\u201cGenerations ago,\u201d says Kennedy, \u201cthe search for spirituality came predefined and prepackaged. [The Church] not only gave us all the answers, it even gave us the questions to ask.\u201d Now many of the old certainties are being reexamined. In an attempt to convey this sea change, Kennedy asked thirty-seven American Catholics to speak candidly about their own faith\u2014whether lost, recovered, or deepened\u2014and about their feelings regarding the way the Church hierarchy is moving forward.The voices included here range from respectful to reproachful and from appreciative to angry. Speaking their minds are businesspeople, actors and entertainers, educators, journalists, politicians, union leaders, nuns, priests\u2014even a cardinal. Some love the Church; some feel intensely that the Church wronged them. All have an illuminating insight or perspective.Kerry Kennedy herself speaks of the joy of growing up as one of Robert and Ethel Kennedy\u2019s eleven children, of the tragedies that eventually befell her family, and of how religion was deeply woven through good times and bad. Journalist Andrew Sullivan talks about reconciling his devout Catholicism with the Church\u2019s condemnation of his identity as a gay man. TV newswoman Cokie Roberts recalls the nuns who taught her and \u201ctook girls seriously when nobody else did.\u201d Comedian Bill Maher declares, \u201cI hate religion. It\u2019s the worst thing in the world\u201d\u2014and goes on to defend his bold assertion. Writer Anna Quindlen depicts a common parental challenge: passing along traditions and values to a younger generation sometimes deaf to spiritual messages.Through these and many other voices that speak not only to Catholics but to all of us, Being Catholic Now redefines an ancient institution in the most contemporary of terms.From Being Catholic Now\u201cWhen my mom asked if I wanted to be a nun, I said I\u2019d rather be a priest. . . . The nuns were always wonderful, but the power was with the priest.\u201d \u2014Nancy Pelosi\u201cThere are aspects of studying the saints, with the candles, incense, and Latin Masses and some of the pageantry of the Church that, as an American historian, make me feel part of a larger wave of history. That it\u2019s not a newfangled religion, which some people get great solace from. I feel that I\u2019m connected to places.\u201d \u2014Douglas Brinkley\u201cFaith isn\u2019t like picking courses off a menu. It\u2019s a journey, and it\u2019s a path. If your path and journey have been within one structure your entire life, then simply leaving isn\u2019t an option.\u201d \u2014Andrew Sullivan\u201cWhy stay Catholic? Because the hierarchy is not the Church. . . .We [the people of God] are the Church. They can\u2019t take that away from us.\u201d \u2014Cokie Roberts\u201cI was told very early on by the nuns that I had an \u2018overabundance of original sin.\u2019 I was a quiet kid, but I was curious. I asked the wrong questions.\u201d \u2014Susan Sarandon\u201cI don\u2019t believe you can be authentically Catholic without being committed to the social doctrine of the Church. When I was in grammar school, we had these little boxes to help the poor. That was good, but that is half of it. The other half is to find out why there are so many poor people and how we can do something to help them.\u201d \u2014Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick \u201cI am reconciled to the oblivion that is coming. I see no proof of anything else, if it is a matter of faith. I admire people who have faith in God. It must be a great comfort to them, but I had to get out from under the fear and the guilt.\u201d  \u2014Frank McCourt\u201cI went to church and the door was locked. I was knocking and ringing the bell. I waited and waited and nobody came. [The priest thought] there was an emergency, because of all the banging and ringing. He looked down at me and said, \u2018What is it?\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry to bother you, Father, but I\u2019ve been away from the Church many, many years and I\u2019d like to come back. I\u2019d like to go to confession.\u2019 He looked at me and something behind his eyes said, \u2018You came to the right place.\u2019 He knew that it was an important moment for me; he got it instantly.\u201d \u2014Martin Sheen",

        "Authors": "By Shlaim, Avi",
        "Description": "During his long reign (1953\u20131999), King Hussein of Jordan was one of the most dominant figures in Middle Eastern politics and a consistent proponent of peace with Israel. This is the first major account of his life, written with access to his official documents and with the cooperation (but not approval) of his family and staff, and also extensive interviews with international policy makers. For more than forty years, Hussein walked a tightrope between the Palestinians and Arab radicals on the one hand and Israel on the other. Avi Shlaim reveals that, for the sake of dynastic and national survival, Hussein initiated a secret dialogue with Israel in 1963 that encompassed more than one thousand hours with Golda Meir, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Shamir, Yitzhak Rabin, and countless others. Shlaim reconstructs this dialogue across battle lines from previously untapped Israeli records and the firsthand accounts of key participants, and makes clear that it was Israeli intransigence that was largely responsible for the failure to achieve a peaceful settlement between 1967 and 1994.At Hussein\u2019s memorial service at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, the Prince of Wales hailed him as \u201ca man amongst men, a king amongst kings.\u201d Lion of Jordan illuminates the triumphs and disappointments, the qualities and character of this extraordinary soldier and statesman, and significantly rewrites the history of the Middle East over the past fifty years.",

They became attached to each other, and Kerasote decided to name the dog Merle and bring him home. There, he realized that Merle\u2019s native intelligence would be diminished by living exclusively in the human world. He put a dog door in his house so Merle could live both outside and in. A deeply touching portrait of a remarkable dog and his relationship with the author, Merle\u2019s Door explores the issues that all animals and their human companions face as their lives intertwine, bringing to bear the latest research into animal consciousness and behavior as well as insights into the origins and evolution of the human-dog partnership. Merle showed Kerasote how dogs might live if they were allowed to make more of their own decisions, and Kerasote suggests how these lessons can be applied universally.",

        "Title": "Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal",
        "Authors": "By Schlosser, Eric",
        "Description": "Are we what we eat?     To a degree both engrossing and alarming, the story of fast food is the story of postwar Amerca. Though created by a handful of mavericks, the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape, widened the chasm between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad. That's a lengthy list of charges, but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning.     Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast food's flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold America's most dangerous job --  meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers' convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations.     Along the way, Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains' efforts to reel in the youngest, most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization -- a phenomenon launched by fast food.     FAST FOOD NATION is a groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.",

        "Title": "Conspiracy of Fools: A True Story",
        "Authors": "By Eichenwald, Kurt",
        "Description": "From an award-winning New York Times reporter comes the full, mind-boggling story of the lies, crimes, and ineptitude behind the spectacular scandal that imperiled a presidency, destroyed a marketplace, and changed Washington and Wall Street forever . . . It was the corporate collapse that appeared to come out of nowhere. In late 2001, the Enron Corporation--a darling of the financial world, a company whose executives were friends of presidents and the powerful--imploded virtually overnight, leaving vast wreckage in its wake and sparking a criminal investigation that would last for years. But for all that has been written about the Enron debacle, no one has yet to re-create the full drama of what has already become a near-mythic American tale.Until now. With Conspiracy of Fools, Kurt Eichenwald transforms the unbelievable story of the Enron scandal into a rip-roaring narrative of epic proportions, one that is sure to delight readers of thrillers and business books alike, achieving for this new decade what books like Barbarians at the Gate and A Civil Action accomplished in the 1990\u2019s.Written in the roller-coaster style of a novel, the compelling narrative takes readers behind every closed door--from the Oval Office to the executive suites, from the highest reaches of the Justice Department to the homes and bedrooms of the top officers. It is a tale of global reach--from Houston to Washington, from Bombay to London, from Munich to Sao Paolo--laying out the unbelievable scenes that twisted together to create this shocking true story. Eichenwald reveals never-disclosed details of a story that features a cast including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Paul O\u2019Neill, Harvey Pitt, Colin Powell, Gray Davis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Alan Greenspan, Ken Lay, Andy Fastow, Jeff Skilling, Bill Clinton, Rupert Murdoch and Sumner Redstone. With its you-are-there glimpse into the secretive worlds of corporate power, Conspiracy of Fools is an all-true financial and political thriller of cinematic proportions.",

With camera in hand and the penchant for the unexpected, Gladstone captures a photographic portrait of small towns with unusual names and the folks who keep them on the map with their (admittedly offbeat) civic pride. You'll meet bar buddies Don, Ron, and Flakey Jake from Goofy Ridge, Illinois; stop in at the mechanics shop in Nothing, Arizona, to confirm that Nothing really does sit in the middle of nowhere; and be regaled with colorful stories from the locals of Boogertown, North Carolina, about how the town got its name. So jump in the backseat of the car and get ready for an honest slice of apple-pie America, chock full of myths, legends, and laughs.\u2022 Gary Gladstone received the 1999 Award for Visual Excellence from the Image Bank, one of the nation's leading photo agencies.",
