Anna would be grateful if something as ordinary as a mere headache was her husband's excuse; Dan's hypochondriac terrors include brain tumors, tropical diseases, and spontaneous combustion. While she loves her husband, she's not ready to give up on sex at age thirty-seven--so what can she do?It's the perfect time for the distraction of a freelance assignment. But what her editor has in mind is a story on the explosive new feminist manifesto that prescribes no-strings-attached affairs for women. Anna's assignment is to interview three women who've had extramarital affairs purely for sexual pleasure--but she's inclined to take her research a bit further....Can a woman have an uncomplicated affair purely for sexual pleasure--or do her emotions invariably interfere? Anna's determined to find out. And despite her worries about her middle-aged body, potential research assistants prove to be plentiful.Going where no journalist has gone before, Anna delves into a world she'd never considered until now. What is, after all, the perfect outfit for committing adultery in? Is it truly beyond the pale to pick up a man--no matter how sexy he is--at a funeral? And what can be done about that single horrifying gray hair? The answers are more hilarious than Anna could ever have predicted.But soon Anna finds herself facing the question that she never thought she'd have to answer: Is she willing to give up her marriage and her children for what may be the biggest gamble of her life?A novel for every woman who's ever wondered--and every woman who hasn't--Neurotica will have you roaring with laughter as it takes you on a wickedly delightful journey of sheer indulgence.",

The result? The Osbournes. The history-making, Emmy-winning, media-frenzied, television-family-concept-redefining reality series that America can't get enough of. The Osbournes are all can't-even-walk-down-the-street-anymore-to-grab-a-bite-to-eat famous.  But hey, you knew all that already -- so here's the part of the story that may have gone over your head. What you've got in your hands goes beyond you tuning in to The Osbournes on MTV. Think of it as ordering the Ozzy Super Deluxe -- the fully authorized, officially sanctioned, Sharon's Seal of Approval companion guide to all things Osbourne.  It's all here: complete synopses to all ten unforgettable episodes (featuring a Bad Word Box Score), exclusive interviews, hundreds of photos, a private tour of the house, what pet's in the doghouse, an Osbourne lexicon, and so much more. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wish they lived next door to you (unless you've got the music cranked at 4:00 A.M.). So spend a little time in the land of Oz -- and discover why there really is no #$&*ing place like home.",

Setting aside appeals for caution in taking on a popular president, Steele throws down the gauntlet, insisting Republicans must expose and refute the policies lying at the heart of this administration\u2019s attempts to resurrect a discredited brand of extreme liberalism.A call to arms for grassroots America, this book argues for abandoning &#147;conservatism-lite,\u201d returning to core conservative principles, and launching an uncompromising campaign for limited government. The path to a Republican renaissance has already been laid, says Steele: the target is the Obama agenda, the method is active opposition, and the time is Right Now.Bonus: Foreword by Newt Gingrich",

He's an affable, though driven, outdoorsman. When Tim suggests \u201cchucking it all\u201d to travel cross-country in a converted bus, Doreen asks, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be like a normal husband in a midlife crisis and have an affair or buy a Corvette?\u201d But she soon shocks them both, agreeing to set forth with their sixty-pound dog, two querulous cats\u2014and no agenda\u2014in a 340-square-foot bus.Queen of the Road is Doreen\u2019s offbeat and romantic tale about refusing to settle; about choosing the unconventional road with all the misadventures it brings (fire, flood, armed robbery, and finding themselves in a nudist RV park, to name just a few). The marvelous places they visit and delightful people they encounter have a life-changing effect on all the travelers, as Doreen grows to appreciate the simple life, Tim mellows, and even the pets pull together. Best of all, readers get to go along for the ride through forty-seven states\u00a0in this often hilarious and always entertaining memoir,\u00a0in which\u00a0a boisterous marriage of polar opposites becomes stronger than ever.",

Like why can't she let her hair a little looser on top? And why can't she wear shoes with a little bit more of a heel? And will she ever really just know for a fact who she is going to marry like her next-older sister, Emma, does? And how does it happen that her just-younger sister, Mandy, is going on a date before Lizzie ever has a real one? So does it matter at all if she eats one more whoopie pie? Amos seems to like her a lot when she pounds out the ping-pong games. He even asks her to be his partner in doubles. But then he asks Ruthie if he can take her home!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has been this way Lizzie's whole life. She has too hot a temper. She hates housework and dislikes babies. She loves driving fast horses but is petrified of going away from home for a week to work as a maud (maid). Now that Lizzie is running around, will she scare off the Amish boys with her hi-jinks manners? She has certainly attracted the attention of the egg-truck driver. A scary thrill runs through her every time the worldly man comes to pick up an order, each time extending his stay a little longer. How long will she keep this a secret from Emma?and from Mamm and Datt? What will become of Lizzie? Is she too spirited, too innocent, and almost too uninhibited for a young Amish woman?Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction?novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.
