        "Description": "\"Instead of proposing another theory of war, their goal is a more modest one of raising the theoretical consciousness of historians. Specifically, they argue that &#39;1) ideology does influence theory, 2) historians do have ideologies as well as theories . . . about which they are not always conscious or consistent, and 3) we can better understand, compare, and evaluate what historians are saying when we comprehend their ideological and theoretical perspectives.&#39; They attempt then, to classify historical interpretations of war according to their ideological/ theoretical orientations, however covert.\" --Perspective\u00a0\"Nelson and Olin .. . are concerned with enhancing history&#39;s social utility by advancing its capacity to produce generalizations that can explain or predict events and are subject to empirical testing. Their exploration of historical generalization focuses on an issue itself of the highest importance, the causes of war; but their aim is also to create a model for historical generalization applicable to other issues. They argue that to understand generalizations in history, one must recognize their roots in theory, and that historians&#39; theories in turn proceed from their own ideologies. To demonstrate, they survey theories about the causes of war that have come out of conservative, liberal, and radical ideologies. . . . any historian will profit from this rigorous approach to the problem.\"\u00a0--Choice\u00a0\"Learned and suggestive, this book clarifies much of what is already known, and points toward new ways of understanding.\"--Library Journal",

He writes about the spiritual world of Flannery O'Connor, the alternate universe of Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses, the mind of H. G. Wells. He brilliantly makes clear for the layperson the possibilities of computer chess and the future of thinking machines, and acquaints us with the biographies of three mathematical geniuses - Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and India's Ramanujan.He also writes about two countries he's lived in and feels passionate about - introducing us to Japan through essays on recently published books by Tanizaki, Kobo Abe, and Murakami; and to Iceland with an homage to Independent People by the Nobel Prize-winning Halldor Laxness, the novel Leithauser calls the \"book of my life.\"Provocative, witty, thoughtful, Leithauser's new book has the power to kindle and ignite our interest in the uncommon people, places, and things that deeply engage him.",

        "Description": "\"Mommy, why can`t the doctors make you better?\"...\"You won`t be there, will you? Who`ll take care of me?\"\u2014Rachel, age 5 AIDS breaks the rules of dying. It strikes the young rather than the old, decimating families and devastating communities. It will leave as its legacy a generation of orphans\u2014traumatized by multiple losses, isolation, stigma, and grief. By the turn of the century, more than a hundred thousand children and youth in the United States\u2014and ten million worldwide\u2014will lose their parents to AIDS.Written by professionals in medicine, law, social work, anthropology, psychiatry, and public policy, this volume is the first full-length look at the issues facing children whose parents and siblings are dying of AIDS: what children experience, how it affects them, how we can meet their emotional needs and help them find second families, how we counter the stigmas they face. Authors explore ways to promote resilience in these AIDS-affected children. Stories of the children and their caretakers, told in their own words, are woven throughout.Pioneering and practical, the book presents an action agenda and resource directory for our nation`s policymakers as well as for parents and those who work with children in both formal and informal settings. This book is produced in conjunction with a video, Mommy, Who`ll Take Care of Me? Forgotten Children of the AIDS Epidemic, which will be shown on PBS and is also available from Yale University Press.",

A young boy living alone with his grandfather helps out a neighbor whose husband, off in Alaska, suddenly isn\u2019t coming home, leaving her to raise their two daughters. At school the children of a disabled couple suffer indignities that their parents know all too well in their own lives, with only a social worker to look after them and a violent relative to endanger them further. But in a small town a great many people encounter one another frequently, often surprisingly, and destinies soon become entwined\u2014for good and for ill\u2014as they confront events that sorely test the limits of their resilience and means, with no refuge available except what their own character and that of others afford them. Spring eventually does reach across the land, and how the people of Eventide get there makes for an engrossing, profoundly moving novel rich in the wisdom, humor, and humanity for which Kent Haruf is justly acclaimed.",

John Harte takes us from Alaskan salmon runs and the Florida everglades to South Pacific coral reefs and the bleak Tibetan plateau. The result is that rare book that bridges the cultures of science and art. Lyrical, vivid portraits of natural wonders and the threats to them are combined with precise scientific accounts of natural processes and their disturbances. The Green Fuse will show nonscientists the fascination of ecological detective work and renew scientists' love for the beauty of the world under their microscopes.Harte's stories illuminate, without sermonizing, the damage to natural systems brought about by technological hubris and calculated political ruthlessness. \"The green fuse\" symbolizes the basic unity behind natural diversity. But a fuse may also be the weak link in an overloaded system or the slow burning wick on an ecological bomb. As The Green Fuse reminds us, the energies that created human liberation from nature can also be those that lead to the human destruction of nature.",

        "Title": "African American Women in Congress: Forming and Transforming History",
        "Authors": "By Gill, Laverne McCain",
        "Description": "Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman in the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected in 1968. That was nearly a hundred years after the election of the first African American man to Congress and fifty years after the first woman. A quarter of a century after Chisholm's election, the first Black woman, Carol Moseley-Braun, was elected to the United States Senate. It was not until 1993, when ten additional Black women won seats in the 103rd Congress, that African American women were allowed to serve their country and their constituencies in any substantial numbers. In 1997 that historic moment will very likely be lost as congressional districts are redrawn by court order. This remarkable book by LaVerne Gill preserves the history of the struggles and accomplishments of these fifteen courageous women, and will move others to learn from and follow their example.African American Women in Congress details the life and career histories of Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, Yvonne Burke, Cardiss Collins, Katie Hall, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Maxine Waters, Barbara-Rose Collins, Carol Moseley-Braun, Corinne Brown, Carrie Meek, Cynthia McKinney, Eva Clayton, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Sheila Jackson-Lee. Each profile contains a picture of its subject, interview material, and resum\u00e9s. Arranged chronologically, the book introduces the reader to issues of vital importance to the Black community\u2014Reconstruction, enfranchisement, lynchings and harassment, civil rights struggles, the founding of advocacy groups, the power of the Congressional Black Caucus, the creation of majority minority districts that allowed greater representation in Congress, the struggle of largely Black Washington, D.C., for representation, and the recent dismantling of past gains by a Republican majority. Gill also describes the uphill battles for social justice and the rights of women that the fifteen women had to wage even within their own political parties, political organizations, and districts.For general readers, high school and college students, and anyone interested in the political process, this book is illuminating and inspiring reading.",

        "Title": "We Write for Our Own Time: Selected Essays from Seventy-Five Years of the Virginia Quarterly Review",
        "Authors": "By Burnham, Alexander (EDT)",
        "Description": "In 1925, Edwin A. Alderman, president of the University of Virginia, fulfilled a long-held dream by establishing a magazine at the institution founded by Thomas Jefferson just over one hundred years earlier. Not only did Alderman initiate publication of the Virginia Quarterly Review, he contributed an essay to its inaugural issue.Appearing as the first selection in this new volume of nonfiction from the VQR, Alderman's \"Edgar Allan Poe and the University of Virginia\" reflects the rare combination of literary sensibility and immersion in the political and social issues of the day, which has characterized the journal throughout its seventy-five-year history. As Alderman writes, \"I may be frank and say that there was a time when Poe did not greatly appeal to me. I felt the sheer, clear beauty of his song..., but his detachment from the world of men, where my interests most centered, left me unresponsive and simply curious.... I have come, however, to see the limitations of that view, and to behold something admirable and strange and wonderful in this proud, gifted man.\"While the style and diction of the contributions have changed in the years since that first spring issue, a similar clarity of thought, deep intelligence, candor, and command of language can be found in every one of the fifty one essays assembled here by Alexander Burnham. From its home at One West Range, a few doors down from Poe's own room, the VQR has welcomed to its pages scholars such as Dumas Malone and Robert Coles, and writers whose books have become international bestsellers, including Arthur C. Clarke and Frances Mayes.Included here are some of the twentieth century's most brilliant thinkers and stylists, such international literary, political, and intellectual figures as Andre Gide, D. H. Lawrence, Aldous Huxley, Evelyn Waugh, T. S. Eliot, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Mann, Jean-Paul Sartre, Bertrand Russell, and Robert Graves. George F. Kennan muses on \"The Experience of Writing History,\" Henry Steele Commager asks \"Do We Have a Class Society?,\" and Edmund S. Morgan considers the aloof character of George Washington. Carlos Baker tracks Ezra Pound through Venice, and Scott Donaldson ponders \"The Jilting of Ernest Hemingway.\" These leading lights share space, as they do in every volume of the journal, with lesser-known but no less talented writers ruminating on the Battle of the Bulge, the Berlin Wall, the Bomb, and Vietnam, on growing up in Hollywood and living in Charlottesville, Virginia.Writers of the South are fittingly represented by Thomas Wolfe, Mary Lee Settle, and Louis D. Rubin Jr., but a quick scan of the table of contents reveals that the VQR has never been a regional magazine. As the current editor, Staige D. Blackford writes in his preface, \"Since its inception, the Virginia Quarterly Review has tried to offer its readers a variety of essays on a variety of topics ranging from foreign affairs to domestic politics, from literature to travel, from sports to sex, from music to medicine.\"On the occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary, We Write for Our Own Time amply and entertainingly reflects what the VQR's masthead has always proclaimed as its identity: \"A National Journal of Literature and Discussion.\"",

        "Title": "Changing Channels: Television and the Struggle for Power in Russia",
        "Authors": "By Mickiewicz, Ellen",
        "Description": "New in paperbackRevised and expandedDuring the tumultuous 1990s, as Russia struggled to shed the trappings of the Soviet empire, television viewing emerged as an enormous influence on Russian life. The number of viewers who routinely watch the nightly news in Russia matches the number of Americans who tune in to the Super Bowl, thus making TV coverage the prized asset for which political leaders intensely\u2014and sometimes violently\u2014compete. In this revised and expanded edition of Changing Channels, Ellen Mickiewicz provides many fascinating insights, describing the knowing ways in which ordinary Russians watch the news, skeptically analyze information, and develop strategies for dealing with news bias.\t Covering the period from the state-controlled television broadcasts at the end of the Soviet Union through the attempted coup against Gorbachev, the war in Chechnya, the presidential election of 1996, and the economic collapse of 1998, Mickiewicz draws on firsthand research, public opinion surveys, and many interviews with key players, including Gorbachev himself. By examining the role that television has played in the struggle to create political pluralism in Russia, she reveals how this struggle is both helped and hindered by the barrage of information, advertisements, and media-created personalities that populate the airwaves. Perhaps most significantly, she shows how television has emerged as the sole emblem of legitimate authority and has provided a rare and much-needed connection from one area of this huge, crisis-laden country to the next. \tThis new edition of Changing Channels will be valued by those interested in Russian studies, politics, media and communications, and cultural studies, as well as general readers who desire an up-to-date view of crucial developments in Russia at the end of the twentieth century.",

        "Description": "Written with the same acerbic wit and infectious humor that has made P. J. O'Rourke one of the most popular political satirists of all time, The Enemies List will keep you howling and his enemies scowling. From Noam Chomsky to Yoko Ono, from Peter, Paul, and Mary (yes, they're still alive) to all the people who think quartz crystals cure herpes, from Ralph Nader to the entire country of Sweden, P. J. O'Rourke has created a roster of the most useless, politically disgraceful, and downright foolish people around. Although a rating system of S=Silly, VS=Very Silly, SML=Shirley MacLaine was ultimately cast aside, the distinguishing feature of the cluster of dunces presented here is silliness, not political subversion. The Enemies List began as an article in the American Spectator and, as readers contributed their own suggestions, quickly grew into a hilarious and slashing commentary on politicians and celebrities alike. Now they have been named, we just need to figure out what to do with them. \"To say that P. J. O'Rourke is funny is like saying that the Rocky Mountains are scenic - accurate but insufficient.\" - Chicago Tribune",

        "Description": "An original account, revolutionary in technique, examining the character of the great Romantic poet Lord Byron through the lives and deadly rivalry of the two women he left behind.The heart of David Crane's account is the lifelong feud between Augusta - Byron's half sister with whom he had a passionate affair - and Annabella, his society wife, both of whom bore him daughters. Crane reimagines the famous meeting between the two women years after Byron's death, a chillingly dramatic scene through which he explores the emotional and sexual truths that lay at the center of these tragic relationships. In the encounter between the two women - one in chronic ill health, the other dying - we have the ultimate display of their mutual obsession with the memory and compulsive influence of Byron that makes their story that of the Romantic Age itself.It is a story full of dubious motives, especially Annabella's \"saving\" of Augusta and her child, Medora, and her twisted revenge on them both. And as the curses of incest and abuse play themselves out in the fates of Byron's daughters, we see their lives assuming the shape of Greek tragedy.In the meeting of the two women and the consequences of their battle, Crane shows us the Romantic Age in its terrible collision with the new world of the Victorians. The Kindness of Sisters establishes Crane as a biographer of formidable gifts.",

With special emphasis on the human toll, Woodward shows the consequences of the new ethics laws, and the emboldened Congress and media. Powerful investigations increasingly stripped away the privacy and protections once expected by the nation's chief executive.

Sike, an adventurer with a yearning to make the record books, had discovered that since Hudson himself, only oceangoing tankers and fishing trawlers had plowed through the bay's wind-whipped and iceberg-studded expanses. He vowed to be the first to sail across the bay, and so began Aqua Star's sub-Arctic adventure.Sike and his wife, Carolann, whose sailing experiences went no further than dinghy lessons on Calgary's Glenmore Reservoir and correspondence courses on navigation, dedicated all of their energy and resources to making their unlikely dream come true. As Sike completed the building of the 41-foot steel yacht, Carolann set out to attract media attention and sponsorship. They found an eager crew in Gay Currie, an experienced sailor who signed on as cook, and David Farr, a nonsailor who undertook to photograph the voyage.For the outdoor enthusiast, Something Worth Doing is an exciting and unusually candid adventure story that records, in the sailors' own words, their exceptional journey, and captures, in vivid full-color photographs, the remote beauty of northern Canada.",

        "Title": "Recasting Autobiography: Women's Counterfictions in Contemporary German Literature and Film (Reading Women Writing)",
        "Authors": "By Kosta, Barbara",
        "Description": "\"How did we become the way we are?\" The question that haunts Christa Wolf's autobiographical work Patterns of Childhood has prompted many other writers and filmmakers to examine their identities as postwar German women. In one of the first books to address the New German Cinema from a feminist perspective, Barbara Kosta looks closely at two autobiographical films; Helma Sanders-Brahms's Germany, Pale Mother and Jutta Bruckner's Years of Hunger, and at two books, Ruth Rehmann's Der Mann auf der Kanzel: Fragen an einen Vater (The man in the pulpit: Questions for a father,) and Wolf's Patterns of Childhood. In different ways, Kosta shows, these works of the 1970s and 1980s have recast traditional autobiography, offering fresh characters in new roles exploring innovative forms of expression, and confronting long-repressed themes such as the devaluation of the female voice and the horror of Germany's fascist past.Kosta perceives in autobiographies by German women a conflict between the need to accept their sociocultural heritage and the desire to uncover and respond to its destructive aspects. As they struggle to redefine relationships among family, history, and self, Wolf and Rehmann write of the psychic structures, that were shaped by a childhood under the Third Reich in their films, Sanders-Brahms and Bruckner, who grew up after the war, explore issues of gender relations as well as re-enacting German history. For all four, Kosta demonstrates, autobiography is at once a process of remembering and working through national and personal trauma, a task of mourning and healing, and an act of self-invention.",

        "Description": "What's it like to sit in the front seat of a patrol car, cruising darkened city streets, when the radio crackles to life and sends you down an alley to a \"robbery in progress,\" the outcome of which you can't possibly predict? What's it like to knock on a crack-house door, service revolver drawn, not knowing who - or what - is behind it? What's it like, heart pounding in your chest, to stare down the barrel of a gun pointed straight at you by a murderously high suspect?Cop shows you what it's like. It's the explosive story of Sergeant Michael Middleton, a now-retired veteran of the LAPD and survivor of what may be the most brutal urban war zone in the country. From handling the call to his first homicide as a rookie cop to making his last collar, Middleton's story is a nerve-shattering, eyewitness account of life on America's meanest streets. In his two decades on the force, he investigated more than 20,000 felony crimes, was at the scene of nearly 600 murders - including those of five officers killed in the line of duty - and made over 3,000 arrests.In Cop, Middleton writes urgently and knowingly of those years on the streets. It's a pulse-quickening - and often heartbreaking - insider's view of life as a foot soldier in America's war on crime. With the threat of violence never far away, Middleton and his fellow officers daily faced drug dealers, desperate addicts, thieves, gun-crazy gangs, rapists, and murderers. And in telling the riveting stories of these encounters, Middleton uses them to make larger points - which will often surprise and shock you - about good, evil, heroism, racism, and more.Gripping, poignant, and brutally honest, Cop is an unforgettable portrait of life as a police officer on urban America's mean and gritty streets.",

        "Description": "Athenais de Montespan reigned as official mistress to Louis XIV during the most glorious period of \"the splendid century.\" As lovely and charming as she was witty and cunning, Athenais quickly rose to far greater prominence than the King's own spouse. It was Madame de Montespan who was known as \"the real Queen of France,\" the symbol of the apotheosis of French culture in the seventeenth century. As a lover, she risked the disgrace of adultery to conduct an affair that scandalized Europe; as a patron, she supported many of the leaders of the cultural renaissance; as a mother, she is the ancestor of most of the royal houses of Europe.In her superb new biography, Lisa Hilton chronicles the life of this extraordinary woman. She vividly describes Athenais's unhappy marriage to a gamester nobleman, her entry into the decadent and intricate world of court politics, and her brilliant seduction of France's most desired suitor, the King himself. Athenais transformed Louis from a shy, awkward young monarch into the polished Sun King of legend.Throughout the \"age Montespan,\" Athenais used her wit and beauty to stave off the intrigues of courtiers, the machinations of Versaille's clerics, and the wiles of lovely young pretenders to the King's heart - all doggedly seeking to unseat her. It was not until the Affair of the Poisons, a bizarre witch-hunt that uncovered conspiracy in the highest echelons of the nobility, that Athenais's hold on the King and court faltered. Though the mystery remains unsolved, Athenais's implication in the sinister dealings of sorcerers and poisoners caused a fall from grace almost as precipitous as her rise.",

Nora\u2019s sister, Alice, adopted him as a pet. The love he brought to her life eased her through a very difficult time - the dissolution of her 18-year marriage. Watching and participating in this special relationship reminded Nora that success takes many forms. Kilroy \"failed\" as a guide dog, but he succeeded in changing Alice\u2019s life for the better. He became her guide as she made her journey from grief to new happiness.     Some of the best teachers in this world have four legs and bark. Dogs help us make friends, transcend tragedies, grieve the loss of loved ones and just plain enjoy life. According to researchers, pets improve our human immune-system functions - a fancy way to say they make us feel good. \"Dear Kilroy,\" a collection of inspirational stories, photographs, and imaginary canine correspondence, celebrates this magical relationship between people and dogs. The book\u2019s true-life stories follow a few special dogs and the human lives they change. As the dogs in these stories strive to fulfill their potential - whether to become a guide for the visually impaired or to become the best, most-trusted pet of someone in need - they teach us all how to become better human beings.",

        "Description": "Overly emotional, hysterical, dependent, frivolous, fickle... Why have women been so consistently defined as deficient in maturity, self-mastery, and independence according to the models of human development inspired by male culture? The authors of WOMEN'S GROWTH IN CONNECTION, a sampling of the influential working papers from the Stone Center, Wellesley College, have sought to answer this question by studying developmental theory and reformulating it to reflect women's experience more accurately. These papers, about women's ways of being in the world, frame an innovative relational perspective on women's psychological development. The authors--clinicians, clinical supervisors, and teachers--have been searching for therapeutic models that take into account women's meaning systems, values, and organization of experiences, all of which often revolves around relationships rather than the self. By offering a new perspective on women's development, WOMEN'S GROWTH IN CONNECTION stands at the forefront of the ongoing feminist movement to examine and reshape psychological theory and practice. The authors offer this volume as an invitation to the reader to join in the building of new models of women's development.",

        "Description": "The acclaimed author of Righteous Pilgrim delivers this dramatic account of the Great Depression as seen by those who lived through it. Less concerned with the power brokers in Washington than with the daily struggles of ordinary people at the grass roots, The Hungry Years draws on little-known oral histories, memoirs, local press, and scholarly monographs to capture the voices of Americans in a time of unprecedented crisis. The result is narrative history at its best: a comprehensive single volume that traces the stages of the disaster chronologically without losing touch with the wounds it inflicted or the ways people responded. Humane and compassionate, historically sound, full of story and anecdote, The Hungry Years puts the reader at the very heart of the maelstrom that was the American Depression.",

        "Title": "The Runaway Brain: The Evolution Of Human Uniqueness",
        "Authors": "By Wills, Christopher",
        "Description": "The human brain is astonishingly different from the brain of any other animal. Why? Have we somehow fooled Mother Nature and escaped from the laws of evolution?Written like a detective story, this book brings together a wealth of new research from paleontology, genetics, and neurobiology to explain the runaway evolution of the human brain. Evolutionists and human paleontologists have tended to assume that our intellect began to burgeon when our ancestors developed the ability to walk upright, to grasp and carry objects, or to form cooperative groups for hunting. While these and many other factors are important, this book shows that they are only some of the latest steps in a long evolutionary story that began a billion years ago. By now, the brains of many different animals are much larger than those of their predecessors and are superbly adapted to environments that have slowly become more complex. But our own distant ancestors were the only ones to enter a new evolutionary path, a feedback loop that involved their brains, their bodies, and an ever more complicated environment that they largely created themselves. The result, for better and sometimes for worse, is our own astonishing species.The author shows how this view of our evolution as a runaway process casts light on a number of major questions that recent discoveries have raised about our past. These include the identity and true role of the mitochondrial Eve, the origin of human diversity, and the confusion and controversy surrounding our fossil record. Two major views of recent human evolution hinge on the time at which people like ourselves first arose. Did they do so in several different parts of the Old World, the so-called \"multiple origins\" model, or did they appear suddenly and recently, perhaps driving all the more primitive hominids to extinction? The first model is favored by many anthropologists; the second, by many geneticists. While it is not yet possible to decide with certainty between the two, the book details how the driving force of runaway brain evolution is so great that it can easily account for multiple origins.Turning to the evolution of the brain itself, the author recounts the escape of our ancestors from the \"stupidworlds\" of the past. He shows how, as a result of this escape, our brains have evolved into sponges for knowledge. They are so versatile, and have been driven by such strong evolutionary pressures, that fundamental human capabilities such as language can be traced to many different parts of the brain that have simultaneously increased in complexity. Using a vivid series of examples, the book details scientists' growing knowledge of the kinds of genetic changes that have powered the runaway process.Written by a scientist whose previous books have explored the whole sweep of evolution and the complexities of the human genome, The Runaway Brain casts a brilliant light on human intellect and human nature.",
