But with this concluding volume in the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy, novelist and Austen aficionada Pamela Aidan at last gives readers the man in full. These Three Remain follows a humbled Darcy on the journey of self-discovery after Elizabeth Bennet\u2019s rejection of his marriage proposal, in which he endeavors to grow into the kind of gentleman he\u2019s always dreamed of being. Happily, a chance meeting with Elizabeth during a tour of his estate in Derbyshire offers Darcy a new opportunity to press his suit, but his newfound strengths are put to the test by an old nemesis, George Wickham. Vividly capturing the colorful historical and political milieu of the Regency era, Aidan writes in a style evocative of her literary progenitor, but with a wit and humor very much her own. While staying faithful to the people and events in Austen\u2019s original, she adds her own fascinating cast of characters, weaving a rich tapestry out of Darcy\u2019s past and present that will beguile his admirers anew.",

Most of the 16 selections in this volume have been taken from the latter collection.The stories in this edition include: \"What I Saw at Shiloh,\" \"A Son of the Gods,\" \"Four Days in Dixie,\" \"One of the Missing,\" \"A Horseman in the Sky,\" \"The Coup de Grace,\" \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\" \"The Story of Conscience,\" \"One Kind of Officer,\" \"Chickamauga,\" and five more.Bierce's stories employ a buildup of suggestive realistic detail to produce grim and vivid tales often disturbing in their mood of fatalism and impending calamity. Hauntingly suggestive, they offer excellent examples of the author's dark pessimism and storytelling power.",

        "Description": "The well-known and very popular Catholic couple, Scott and Kimberly Hahn, have been constantly travelling and speaking all over North America for the last few years about their conversion to the Catholic Church. Now these two outstanding Catholic apologists tell in their own words about the incredible spiritual journey that led them to embrace Catholicism. Scott Hahn was a Presbyterian minister, the top student in his seminary class, a brilliant Scripture scholar, and militantly anti-Catholic ... until he reluctantly began to discover that his enemy had all the right answers. Kimberly, also a top-notch theology student in the seminary, is the daughter of a well-known Protestant minister, and went through a tremendous dark night of the soul after Scott converted to Catholicism. Their conversion story and love for the Church has captured the hearts and minds of thousands of lukewarm Catholics and brought them back into an active participation in the Church. They have also influenced countless conversions to Catholicism among their friends and others who have heard their powerful testimony. Written with simplicity, charity, grace and wit, the Hahns' deep love and knowledge of Christ and of Scripture is evident and contagious throughout their story. Their love of truth and of neighbor is equally evident, and their theological focus on the great importance of the family, both biological and spiritual, will be a source of inspiration for all readers.",

In the chase that ensues, an old man's skills are matched against a young man's daring.Call's long hunt takes him into the Texas Panhandle, across the Pecos, and into northern Mexico. In pursuing Joey Garza, and the psychopathic manburner Mox Mox, Call traverses one of the last untamed and unsettled stretches of the American West.Call takes with him an Eastern dude; an incompetent deputy; and his old corporal, Pea Eye Parker, now married to Lorena - once in love with Gus McCrae.In Mexico he meets Maria, Joey Garza's mother, the gallant Mexican woman who struggles to save her son, both from Captain Call and from himself. As the chase progresses we meet such true-life Westerners as John Wesley Hardin, Judge Roy Bean and the great cattleman Charles Goodnight.The struggle that animates this novel is not merely between an old man and a young man; it is also a struggle between civilization and barbarism.

Anxious families await word of college acceptances. In these last pressure-cooker months of high school, some kids will make the all-too-common and all-too-dangerous mistake of drinking and driving.

Several nights later, the call comes at 2:00 AM, and true to his word, Myron picks up one of the girls in midtown Manhattan and drives her to a quiet cul-de-sac in New Jersey where she says her friend lives.The next day, the girl's parents discover that their daughter is missing. And that Myron was the last person to see her. Desperate to fulfill a well-intentioned promise turned nightmarishly wrong, Myron races to find her before she's gone forever. But his past will not be buried so easily - for trouble has always stalked him, and his loved ones often suffer.

        "Title": "The Ethical Brain",
        "Authors": "By Gazzaniga, Michael S.",
        "Description": "Will increased scientific understanding of our brains overturn our beliefs about moral and ethical behavior? How will increasingly powerful brain imaging technologies affect the ideas of privacy and of self-incrimination? Such thought-provoking questions are rapidly emerging as new discoveries in neuroscience have raised difficult legal and ethical dilemmas. Michael Gazzaniga, widely considered to be the father of cognitive neuroscience, investigates with an expert eye some of these controversial and complex issues in The Ethical Brain. He first examines \"lifespan neuroethics\" and considers how brain development defines human life, from when an embryo develops a brain and could be considered \"one of us\" to the issues raised as the brain ages, such as whether we should have complete freedom to extend our lives and enhance our brains through the use of genetics, pharmaceuticals, and training. Gazzaniga also considers the challenges posed to the justice system by new discoveries in neuroscience. Recent findings suggest that our brain has already made a decision before we become fully aware of doing so, raising the question of whether the concept of personal responsibility can remain a fundamental tenet of the law. Gazzaniga argues that as neuroscience learns more about the unreliability of human memory, the very foundation of trial law will be challenged. Gazzaniga then discusses a radical re-evaluation of the nature of moral belief, as he not only looks at possibly manipulating the part of the brain that creates beliefs but also explores how scientific research is building a brain-based account of moral reasoning. The Ethical Brain is a groundbreaking volume that presents neuroscience's loaded findings--and their ethical implications--in an engaging and readable manner, offering an incisive and thoughtful analysis of the medical ethics challenges confronting modern society at the dawn of the twenty-first century.",

Nor has he ever touched a football.What changes? He takes up football, and school, after a rich, Evangelical, Republican family plucks him from the mean streets. Their love is the first great force that alters the world's perception of the boy, whom they adopt. The second force is the evolution of professional football itself into a game where the quarterback must be protected at any cost. Our protagonist turns out to be the priceless combination of size, speed, and agility necessary to guard the quarterback's greatest vulnerability: his blind side.",

Early in the day, a grisly machine gun attack in the Dupont Circle Metro station leaves dozens dead and the city crippled with fear. A note delivered to the mayor's office pins the massacre on the Digger, a robotlike assassin programmed to wreak havoc on the capital every four hours -- until midnight. Only a ransom of $20 million delivered to the Digger's accomplice -- and mastermind -- will end the death and terror. But the Digger becomes a far more sinister threat when his accomplice is killed in a freak accident while en route to the money drop. With the ransom note as the single scrap of evidence, Special Agent Margaret Lukas calls upon Parker Kincaid, a retired FBI agent and the top forensic document examiner in the country. Somehow, by midnight, they must find the Digger -- before he finds them.  In The Devil's Teardrop, Jeffery Deaver delivers the same intricate forensic detail, masterful plot twists and harrowing breakneck pace that made A Maiden's Grave, The Bone Collector and The Coffin Dancer national bestsellers. The Devil's Teardrop is destined to continue Jeffery Deaver's bestselling track record and thrill his legions of fans worldwide.",
