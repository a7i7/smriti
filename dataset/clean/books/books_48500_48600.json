Until life handed her the dubious ability to travel outside of her body at will - which she turned into a career, hiring herself out as a literal spook. Industrial espionage, domestic surveillance, you name it - when she's traveling she can see but can't be seen.Then one night things get out of hand while she is out-of-body: Zoe witnesses a murder. What's worse, the killer is also a Traveler - and he most definitely not only sees her, but tries to pursue her.To save herself, Zoe must somehow guide the very handsome detective assigned to the case to the truth without revealing herself. And with the help of her semi-psychic mom, a pair of gay ghosts, and her best friend (a Goth techno witch), she also has to figure out exactly who - and what - the murderer is, before he finds her and puts an end to her traveling - permanently.",

Dalziel is, and was, and forever shall be, world without end, amen. Everybody knew that. Therein lay half his power. Chief constables might come and chief constables might go, but Fat Andy went on forever. Caught in the blast of a huge explosion, Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel lies on a hospital bed, with only a life support system and his indomitable will between him and the Great Beyond. Meanwhile, his colleague, Chief Inspector Peter Pascoe, is determined to find those responsible. Ignoring his own injuries, the advice of his friends, and the pleas of his wife, Pascoe follows a winding trail to the Templars, a mysterious group that believes the only way to fight terrorism is through terror. Where the arm of the law cannot reach, their work begins. Soon Pascoe comes to suspect that they may have support and sympathy in high places, from men ready to accept the death of a policeman or of any other innocent bystander as regrettable but unavoidable collateral damage. From the streets of Manchester to the Yorkshire countryside, Pascoe searches for the truth. And above it all, like a huge zeppelin threatening to break from its moorings, hovers the disembodied spirit of Andy Dalziel.",

With her father and brothers unemployed and her family perilously short of money, she needs the work.The domestic dispute at a house in a wealthy suburb seems like nothing unusual - at first. The elegant blonde in the shadows bleeding from a head injury doesn't want any help; and the well-dressed, ingratiating man at the front door tells Paddy everything's fine and that she should leave.And then he asks her to make sure nothing appears in the paper, slipping cash into her hand before he closes the door.The next morning Paddy sees the lead TV news story: the blond woman had been tortured, beaten, and left to die. The untraceable man was neither her boyfriend nor her husband, and Paddy can't understand why the victim passed up the chance to walk through the door and live. Far from the spoiled trophy wife Paddy assumed her to be, the victim was a prosecution lawyer with a social conscience that clashed with her privileged background. Soon Paddy begins to make connections no one else has seen, and after she witnesses the body of a suicide being pulled from the river, she finds surprising links between the two deaths.It's the story Paddy's dreamed of, but she'll lose all credibility if word gets out about the bribe. The police who attended the call are twisting the evidence for reasons of their own, and her boss at the newspaper is impatient with Paddy's unproven hunches. Only Paddy care enough to pursue a dark and brutal truth that could make her career - or kill her.",

And he just happens to live in Eastport ...Jemmy wants to end his ordeal once and for all ... even it means confronting the killer on his own turf. And Jake's cottage is the perfect hideout while he plans his next move. But the body Jake and Ellie find dangling at the end of a rope in the hit man's barn throws a wrench into all their plans - big time.Accused of stalking the hired killer's daughter, the victim apparently committed suicide. Only Jake believes otherwise. Her remodeling instincts may fail her now and then, but as a former money manager to the mob, she knows how the bad guys think. There's more to this story than anyone's telling, and she's about to risk her life exposing the truth.

        "Title": "Confessions: The Making of a Postdenominational Priest",
        "Authors": "By Fox, Matthew",
        "Description": "Visionary, activist, and one of the most important religious thinkers and teachers of our time, Matthew Fox has devoted his career to unleashing the suppressed mystical and life-affirming traditions within Christianity. His theology of \"Creation Spirituality\" - notably the belief that we are born in \"original blessing\" - has reinvigorated the faith of countless Christians and earned him the headline-making censure of the Vatican, who officially \"silenced\" Fox in 1989 and precipitated his dismissal by the Dominican Order in 1993.In this always compelling memoir, Fox, now an Episcopal priest, traces the roots of his radical theology, from his 195Os childhood in Madison, Wisconsin, through formative years spent training in a late-sixties Paris rocked by revolutionary fervor, to taking on the Vatican (which he likens to standing in front of a train), to his most recent experiences as a leader of \"rave masses\" for urban young people. Written with his characteristic candor and insight, Confessions details Fox's spiritual, intellectual, political, and cultural evolution as an envelope-pushing member of a generation \"bold enough to question many things and to seek spirituality over religion.\"Fox's story mirrors the questions and concerns of those millions of contemporary seekers with a \"passion for holiness\"; a yearning for a Christian spirituality committed to social justice, feminism, and environmentalism; and a desire for ritual that heals, celebrates, and honors the gifts of being in each of us. Always relentlessly ahead of his time, Fox embraces his role as a \"post-denominational priest,\" passionately exploring the present and future role of faith, church, and a spirituality grounded in the emphatic belief that finding God is still possible.",

But Dead Certainties goes beyond these more conventional histories to address the deeper enigmas that confront a student of the past. In order to do so, Schama reconstructs -- and at times reinvents -- two ambiguous deaths: the first, that of General James Wolfe at the battle of Quebec in 1759; the second, in 1849, that of George Parkman, an eccentric Boston brahmin whose murder by an impecunious Harvard professor in 1849 was a grisly reproach to the moral sanctity of his society. Out of these stories -- with all of their bizarre coincidences and contradictions -- Schama creates a dazzling and supremely vital work of historical imagination.",

        "Title": "TRIAD POWER",
        "Authors": "By Ohmae, Kenichi",
        "Description": "During the last year renowned business strategist Kenichi Ohmae's pathbreaking ideas on the globalization of industries and products have made headlines in leading financial newspapers and business publications on three continents. Now, in this eagerly awaited book, Ohmae integrates and expands his much discussed concepts -- to demonstrate why corporations hoping to compete in the global arena must become \"insiders\" in what he calls the Triad: Europe, Japan, and the United States.  Ohmae explains that becoming an insider means nothing less than full membership in the indigenous business communities at each corner of the Triad. Why? In such high-tech industries as computers, consumer electronics, and communications, the rapid pace of product innovation and development no longer allows firms the luxury of testing the home market before probing abroad. Moreover, because consumer preferences vary subtly by culture and are in constant flux, companies must intimately understand local tastes -- and react instantly to changing market trends and prices. Political considerations play a part as well: Ohmae's insiders possess greater immunity to protectionism than do outsiders. Finally, capturing markets in all three parts of the Triad is often the only way to achieve the economies of scale world-class automated plants demand in order to pay for themselves.  Which is the best path to insider status? Pointing out that only a handful of corporations have the resources -- or the product lines -- to dominate any one Triad market, Ohmae shows how joint ventures and international consortia have already given a range of firms (for example, Mazda, Ford, Renault in cars, Mitsubishi, Westinghouse, and Olivetti in robots) the local manufacturing, distribution, research, and marketing talent they need to be successful Triad competitors. He warns, too, that if destructive trade wars are to be avoided or their effects blunted, more such cooperative efforts must be made -- and soon.  In a world where the growing parity among American multinationals and their European and Japanese counterparts has made technological and marketing advantages increasingly difficult to acquire or sustain, Triad Power offers a pragmatic alternative: cross-cultural alliances that accept a future in which change is inevitable -- and where only risks bring rewards. Required reading for senior and general managers and for corporate planners and financial analysts, it is a challenging, thought-provoking, cosmopolitan look at the new rules of global competition.",

But spa owner Olivia Marchant has other problems besides sabotage. Someone is threatening her husband, Maurice, one of London's leading cosmetic surgeons and the man responsible for reconstructing many of the world's rich and famous. In a culture where no one wants to grow old and everyone seems to believe in the power of the knife, Hannah feels like an alien visitor.

        "Title": "Divided America: The Ferocious Power Struggle in American Politics",
        "Authors": "By Black, Earl and Black, Merle",
        "Description": "Divided America tells the biggest story in American politics today. It's the story behind the emergence of a ferocious power struggle between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats that is tearing the country's politics apart.Drawing on extensive polling data and close analyses of presidential, senatorial, and congressional elections over the past fifty years, two eminent political scientists show, for the first time, how partisan warfare has reduced both major parties to minority status and locked them into fierce power struggles in each election cycle, thereby making America less stable and more difficult to govern.Because the two major parties are now evenly balanced in the national electorate, control of the White House and Congress can shift dramatically with each election. Neither Republicans nor Democrats operate with any \"lock\" on the presidency, House of Representatives, or Senate, as demonstrated by the 2006 congressional elections. Earl Black and Merle Black examine the party battles as they've played themselves out in the nation's five principal geographic areas. Each party has developed two important regional strongholds, as exemplified in the 2004 elections, when Republicans won all the electoral votes and sizable majorities of House and Senate seats in the South and Mountain/Plains states while the Democrats won almost all the electoral votes and large majorities in the Northeast and the Pacific Rim states. The Midwest is the perennial swing region.The authors describe the enormous changes that have occurred in the electorates of each region over the past fifty years -- with emphasis on how the size and partisan affiliations of key groups have changed -- and show how these transformations have generated today's unstable two-party battles. Although the relentlessly competitive nature of modern American politics is generally appreciated, the regional causes underlying this new state of affairs are not well understood. Because neither Democrats nor Republicans can produce national majorities simply by sweeping their regional strongholds, they are locked in a fierce power struggle in each election. Divided America tells the story of these remarkable developments in clear, vigorous prose and provides a pragmatic understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each party.For the foreseeable future, each party will be within striking distance of winning -- or losing -- political power in every national institution. Understanding the party battles in America's regions is vital to understanding how today's losers can become tomorrow's winners",

        "Title": "The Anthropological Lens: Harsh Light, Soft Focus",
        "Authors": "By Peacock, James L.",
        "Description": "Anthropology is a complex, wide-ranging, and ever changing field. Yet, despite its diversity, certain major themes do occur in the understandings of the world that anthropologists have offered. In this clear, coherent, and well-crafted book, James L. Peacock spells out the central concepts, distinctive methodologies, and philosophical as well as practical issues of cultural anthropology. Designed to supplement standard textbooks and monographs, the book focuses on the premises that underlie the facts that the former kinds of works generally present. Free from unnecessarily abstract theoretical language and based on compelling concrete anecdote and engaging illustration, it is written in terms understandable to the anthropological novice, as well as being of value to the professional. The book's three main concerns are the substance, method, and significance of anthropology. In his discussion of substance, method, and significance of anthropology, such as the concept of culture, as well as holism. In writing about method, he explores the distinctive character of ethnographic fieldwork and raises questions of interpretation and comparison. Finally, he considers the relevance of anthropology with respect to both its practical application and what it contributes to understanding of human affairs. Using the photographic metaphors of 'harsh light' and 'soft focus', Peacock characterizes the anthropological worldview as consisting of two elements: on the one hand, a concern with the basic reality of the human condition, free of cultural influence; on the other, a broadly based holism that attempts to grasp all aspects of that condition, including its relation to the anthropologist. His book will appeal widely to readers interested in anthropology, at all levels.",

        "Description": "It is 1959 when Haruko, a young woman of good family, marries the Crown Prince of Japan, the heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne. She is the first non-aristocratic woman to enter the longest-running, almost hermetically sealed, and mysterious monarchy in the world. Met with cruelty and suspicion by the Empress and her minions, Haruko is controlled at every turn. The only interest the court has in her is her ability to produce an heir. After finally giving birth to a son, Haruko suffers a nervous breakdown and loses her voice. However, determined not to be crushed by the imperial bureaucrats, she perseveres. Thirty years later, now Empress herself, she plays a crucial role in persuading another young woman\u2014a rising star in the foreign ministry\u2014to accept the marriage proposal of her son, the Crown Prince. The consequences are tragic and dramatic. Told in the voice of Haruko, meticulously researched and superbly imagined, The Commoner is the mesmerizing, moving, and surprising story of a brutally rarified and controlled existence at once hidden and exposed, and of a complex relationship between two isolated women who, despite being visible to all, are truly understood only by each other. With the unerring skill of a master storyteller, John Burnham Schwartz has written his finest novel yet.",

        "Title": "A Democracy at War: America's Fight at Home and Abroad in World War II",
        "Authors": "By O'Neill, William L",
        "Description": "As America fought to defend democratic ideals in Europe and Asia during World War II, our own democratic politics at home paradoxically created a far less than efficient war effort on both civilian and military fronts. While America's glorious triumphs in World War II are well known, the story of our country's failure to swiftly and effectively mobilize and energize our war machine is yet to be fully told. Now, in a broad-ranged domestic, military, and diplomatic history, William O'Neill tells the story of America's strengths and its weaknesses in fighting the Good War.The United States won its victory in World War II not, as legend has it, because of superior numbers and material predominance. Reluctant even to enter the war, the American government proceeded by costly half-measures even after committing to fight. Official reticence and bureaucratic bungling led to inferior and defective weapons, too few infantrymen, the squandering of GI's lives in strategically useless attacks, and other tragic mistakes. The Sherman tank was a deathtrap and the torpedoes of American submarines routinely malfunctioned. Afraid to alarm voters, Congress failed to act on many issues, such as the decision to increase military spending before the war, which could have brought the conflict to a faster end, with less bloodshed. O'Neill traces much of the official bungling to domestic politics and paradoxically to the democratic process itself, which limited Roosevelt's flexibility in wartime.Yet, despite these obstacles, the blood and valor of the men who fought and the strength and struggles of those who remained at home made up for an overly cautious and ambivalent democratic leadership. William O'Neill brings this war generation to life to tell the story of the country which had long seemed willing to ignore the world but ultimately roused itself to defend it.",

No, what completely unbalances her is the teen-scene at a New Year's Eve party. Caught up in this adolescent ambush, Sammy begins to doubt herself. And if she can't trust her own instincts, how can she possibly figure out who burned down a pioneer-era cabin, how a 200-pound pig has disappeared , or why Casey might want to hold her hand?In this fifth Sammy Keyes mystery, Wendelin Van Draanen gives us her most ambitious work to date. While her prose is as comic as ever, there's a very serious undercurrent here--Sammy is tossed and torn, both literally and figuratively, as she shoots the rapids of this plot. But in puzzling out whodunit and how and why, she manages not only to turn the culprits over to the police, but also to reclaim a belief in her own strength.",

        "Description": "Between 1803 and 1806 Meriwether Lewis and William Clark co-captained the fabled expedition across the North American continent.  But while Lewis ended his life just three years later, Clark, as the highest ranking Ferderal official in the West, spent three decades overseeing its consequences: Indian removal and the destruction of Native America.  In a rare combination of storytelling and scholarship, best-selling author Landon Y. Jones presents for the first time Clark's remarkable life and influential career in their full complexity.Like every colonial family living on Virginia's violent frontier, the Clarks killed Indians and acquired land; acting on behalf of the United States, William would prove the most successful at it.  Clark's life was spent fighting in America's fifty-year running war with the Indians (and their European allies) over the western borderlands.  The struggle began with his famed brother George Roger's western campaigns during the American Revolution, continued through the vicious western battles of the War of 1812, and ended with the Black Hawk War in the 1830s.  In vividly depicting Clark's life, Jones memorably captures the dark and bloody ground of America's early West.  Newly discovered documents also shed light on Clark's relationship with Lewis, the extent to which the latter relied on Clark, and how the famed expedition itself was of a piece with the espionage, intrigue, and warfare that realized America's grander enterprise: the shaping of the West.  No one played a larger part in that accomplishment that William Clark.",

        "Description": "Ann Packer\u2019s debut novel, The Dive from Clausen\u2019s Pier, was a nationwide best seller that established her as one of our most gifted chroniclers of the interior lives of women. Now, in her long-awaited second novel, she takes us on a journey into a lifelong friendship pushed to the breaking point. Expertly, with the keen introspection and psychological nuance that are her hallmarks, she explores what happens when there are inequities between friends and when the hard-won balances of a long relationship are disturbed, perhaps irreparably, by a harrowing crisis.Liz and Sarabeth were childhood neighbors in the suburbs of northern California, brought as close as sisters by the suicide of Sarabeth\u2019s mother when the girls were just sixteen. In the decades that followed\u2014through Liz\u2019s marriage and the birth of her children, through Sarabeth\u2019s attempts to make a happy life for herself despite the shadow cast by her mother\u2019s act\u2014their relationship remained a source of continuity and strength. But when Liz\u2019s adolescent daughter enters dangerous waters that threaten to engulf the family, the fault lines in the women\u2019s friendship are revealed, and both Liz and Sarabeth are forced to reexamine their most deeply held beliefs about their connection. Songs Without Words is about the sometimes confining roles we take on in our closest relationships, about the familial myths that shape us both as children and as parents, and about the limits\u2014and the power\u2014of the friendships we create when we are young. Once again, Ann Packer has written a novel of singular force and complexity: thoughtful, moving, and absolutely gripping, it more than confirms her prodigious literary gifts.",

A wake-up call to women all over the country, this landmark novel of early American feminism tells of a Louisiana wife who discovers the strength of her own sexuality and tries to wrench it from the hands of a patriarchal society. And just as Edna Pontellier is ostracized for trying to master her own sexual fate, so did Chopin\u2019s reputation suffer after she wrote this book. Today The Awakening is considered a masterpiece and, along with Chopin\u2019s short stories, has set a standard for younger generations of women who have learned to value their independence and authenticity.Edited and with an Introduction by Barbara H. Solomon and with a New Afterword by Roxane Gay.",
