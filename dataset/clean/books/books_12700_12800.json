        "Authors": "By Greenlaw, Linda",
        "Description": "Just before Christmas, Linda meets up with her best friend and fellow fisherman Alden Leeman for lunch and a drink at the Dry Dock, a well-worn watering hole in Portland, Maine. Alden, the captain of Linda's first fishing expedition, has seen his share of mishaps and adventures at sea. When Linda shares memories of navigating her ship through one of the craziest storms she's ever seen, Alden quickly follows up with his own tales. Then other fishermen, who are sitting on the periphery attentively listening, decide to weigh in with yarns of their own. All Fishermen Are Liars brims with true stories of the most eccentric crew member, the funniest episode, the biggest fish, and the wildest night at sea. Denizens of the Dry Dock drift in and out as the bar begins to swell with rounds of drinks and tales that increase in drama. Here are some of the greatest fishing stories ever--all relayed by Linda Greenlaw in her inimitable style. All Fishermen Are Liars will give readers what they have come to love and expect from Linda Greenlaw--luminous descriptions and edge-of-the-seat thrills. It's the perfect book for anyone who loves fishing and the sea.",

In Night After Night, which relives a performance of The Big Apple Circus, the reader shares the same delight and surprise felt by the audience when the lights go up.Meet Katja Schumann, La Dame du Cirque, who enchants us with her equestrian wizardry and who gave birth to her second child after performing in the evening show; Zamoratte, the contortionist, who squeezes himself whole into a bottle; Anna May, the intuitive performer and seasoned pro, who happens to be a 49-year-old elephant; and Paul Binder, the Ringmaster, who is both master and servant of the spectacle. Diana Cooper spotlights the circus family with spellbinding stories from the performers themselves.Circus is more than mere entertainment: It is a classical art form that blends an immersion in fantasy with consummate skills and traditions. It is the only art form in which varied species work and play as equals. Citing philosophers, poets, and circus lore, Cooper illuminates the special relationship between humans and animals. She views circus as embodying a rich fount of ideas: human/animal coexistence, the beauties of diversity, the permutations of fantasy and reality, our relation to ourselves and the world around us, and notions of what is - and what is not - natural.For centuries circuses have evoked awe, fear, wonder, and joy. As Cooper writes, \"We need fantasies, and circus acknowledges that fantasy is reality wildly elaborated, reality in focus.\" Night After Night captures the poetry of that spirit, pervading and surrounding us with the total magic of circus.",

        "Description": "In a chronicle of three generations of three working-class families, award-winning journalist Samuel G. Freedman tells the human story of the political transformation of twentieth-century America - the rise and fall of FDR's New Deal coalition and its displacement by the new conservatism of Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich. This is the single most important political phenomenon of our times.Freedman has selected three families who are at once singular and broadly representative. They are families who reached this country just as the century was beginning and struggled as blacksmiths and domestics and butchers and plumbers to gain a foothold. They are families who acted on their beliefs not only by voting but also by organizing neighborhoods and leading union chapters, canvassing precincts and watching polls and marching in torch-light parades. These families were pillars of the Democratic coalition that largely led America from 1932 until 1968 - community activists, trade unionists, machine politicians, with loyalties based on religion, ethnicity, and social class. These families equally embody the forces that shifted the majority into Republican hands for all but four years between 1968 and 1992 - grievances about taxes, crime, and reverse discrimination; the rise of suburbia and a shift to a new political machine based on private financing for development rather than public works. They are individuals who shifted from New Deal Democrats to Reagan Republicans to a mixture of GOP stalwarts, hesitant Clinton backers, and political dropouts. And in so doing, they carried with them a nation's destiny.The Inheritance will change our understanding of how and why America selects its leaders.",

        "Title": "The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House",
        "Authors": "By Woodward, Bob",
        "Description": "Working behind the scenes for the eighteen months following Bill Clinton's election, conducting hundreds of interviews with administration insiders and other key officials, and gaining access to confidential internal memos, diaries, and meeting notes, Bob Woodward has discovered how the Clinton White House really works.  Clinton's pledge for a new economic deal was the cornerstone of his 1992 campaign, and fulfilling it has been his central ambition and enterprise as president. By focusing on Clinton's efforts to pass a comprehensive economic recovery plan, Woodward takes us not only to the highest level meetings, the hard-fought debates, and the most difficult decisions but also to the very hear of this presidency -- and of this man.  With its day-by-day, often minute-by-minute account, it is one of the most intimate portraits of a sitting president ever published. President Clinton is shown as he debates, scolds, pleads, celebrates, and rages in anger and frustration. What emerges also is a group portrait of Clinton's innermost circle of advisers in action -- including his wife, Hillary; Vice President Al Gore; Treasure Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the economic team; George Stephanopoulos and David Gergen and the White House staff; James Carville, Paul Begala, and the other outside political strategists; Congressional leaders; and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.   Using his proven research method -- returning time and again to key sources and relying on the paper trail of internal documentation -- Woodward has assembled an extensive archive of the early Clinton presidency. This microscopic examination of the Clintons and this administration, working under pressure on the nation's most important task, reveals the deep and still unsettled conflicts among President Clinton's advisers and within himself. The questions about the federal deficit, health care, welfare reform, taxes, jobs, government spending, interest rates, the roles and responsibilities of the middle class, the wealthy, and the poor are of lasting importance. How they are being answered affects each person in the country.",

Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She? was on the New York Times bestseller list for over twelve months. The field about her was strewn with the wounded carcasses of the Bushwazee, members of the Texas Legislature, and assorted other scoundrels, while the state of Texas, the democratic process, and Ann Richards had never looked better.Well, as they often say in Amarillo, \"Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.\" Nothin' but Good Times Ahead is Molly Ivins's second collection, and she hasn't stopped callin' 'em as she sees 'em. But this time around she's had for material the only human activity that could possibly give Texas local politics a run for its money (not to mention our money!) - the 1992 presidential campaign. From the early battles of the Democratic pygmies to the Clinton campaign's bimbo eruptions, from Bush's bathos to the Republican National Convention, and from one end of H. Ross Perot to the other, it was a rare year for Molly's brand of political reporting.At the same time, Molly has had to cope with the vicissitudes of being a bestselling \"arthur,\" several months of unemployment after the death of the Dallas Times Herald, and the usual truckloads of tough talk, byplay, and backroom deals among the 181 miscreants, Bible-thumpers, indictees, and occasional honest men and women Texans have elected to govern them. Nothin' but Good Times Ahead does more than its part in the battle to inject common sense, quick wit, and wicked humor into American politics.",

The book recommends taking stock of one's current level of health, physical abilities, ongoing medical concerns and current medication.

There are fitness and balance exercises that will improve health and a sense of well-being.     Fall-proofing a home is also covered, as is being aware of the best way to            respond to hazardous situations such as icy or slippery conditions.    A final section describes what to do after a fall starting with how to safely get up again, regaining confidence, as well as how to choose canes and walkers.",

        "Title": "The Graywolf Annual Five: Multi-Cultural Literacy",
        "Authors": "By Walker, Scott and Rick, Simonsen (EDT)",
        "Description": "The issue of cultural literacy has been the subject of intense debate in the past two years. Several bestselling books about the deficiencies of our educational system as well as changes in basic curriculum at more than one major university have contributed to the fervor of this debate.Fueling the national controversy is the question of what body of knowledge constitutes cultural literacy. While many argue for a return to a \"back to basics\" curriculum, equally energetic voices call for a revised curriculum, one which embraces both traditional western classics and the classics of non-European cultures, among them African, Asian, and Latin American.This volume brings together thirteen essays which suggest the range of knowledge truly literate individuals need to possess. Essays by such writers as James Baldwin, Carlos Fuentes, Michelle Cliff, Paula Gunn Allen, Ishmael Reed, and Wendell Berry enlarge our perspective to include a variety of voices and heritages which contribute to the vibrant culture of the United States.Also included is a beginning list of names, places, dates, and concepts which are part and parcel of a multi-cultural fabric.",
