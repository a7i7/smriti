        "Description": "Polls show that Americans from every political, racial, and economic group in the country are mad at the media, but members of the press claim this simply proves that they are doing their job: reporting the news without fear or favor. As James Fallows demonstrates in this razor-sharp indictment, not only is the press not doing \"the job,\" it is actually getting in the way of Americans doing their jobs as citizens.Fallows details the ways in which the current style of news coverage engenders a sense of futility in the American public with regard to its ability to influence our society. Drawing on his own richly varied experience as a reporter and on scores of interviews with members of the print and broadcast media, he reveals how the reigning destructive practices evolved, and whose interests they serve.Outside the urban centers of media power, Fallows finds a new public-spirited approach to news coverage that is gathering passionate adherents while meeting fierce resistance from the media old guard. Breaking the News will ignite the increasingly heated debate over the role of the American media.",

        "Authors": "By Falk, Richard A. and Friel, Howard",
        "Description": "When the New York Times finally apologized for its coverage of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction in 2004, it was too late. The newspaper had already supported the invasion. The Bush administration was not only violating international law, it was lying to the public, using major media like the Times to spread its message.In this meticulously researched study\u2014the first part of a two-volume work\u2014Howard Friel and Richard Falk demonstrate how the newspaper of record in the United States has consistently, over the last 50 years, misreported the facts related to the wars waged by the United States. From Vietnam in the 1960s to Nicaragua in the 1980s and Iraq today, the authors accuse the New York Times of serial distortions. They claim that such coverage now threatens not only world legal order but constitutional democracy in the United States.Falk and Friel show, for example, that, despite numerous US threats to invade Iraq, and despite the fact that an invasion of one country by another implicates fundamental aspects of the UN Charter and international law, the New York Times editorial page never mentioned the words \u201cUN Charter\u201d or \u201cinternational law\u201d in any of its 70 editorials on Iraq from September 11, 2001, to March 20, 2003. The authors also show that the editorial page supported the Bush administration\u2019s WMD claims against Iraq, and that its magazine, op-ed and news pages performed just as poorly.In conclusion the authors suggest an alternative editorial policy of \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d that incorporates the UN Charter and the US Constitution in the Times coverage of the use and threat of force by the United States and the protection of civil and human rights at home and abroad.",

It begins  in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old   girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery  to a renowned geisha house.  We witness her  transformation as she learns the rigorous  arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair;  pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival  for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it.   In Memoirs of a Geisha,  we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned  to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men;  and where love is scorned as illusion.  It is a  unique and triumphant work of fiction\u2014at  once romantic, erotic, suspenseful\u2014and completely unforgettable.",

        "Description": "Here is a sparkling collection of Crown jewels--from amusing tales that humanize their subjects to dramatic stories of martyrdoms, palace intrigues, and bloody battles.  Elizabeth Longford, intimate of the royal family and biographer of Victoria and Elizabeth II, has assembled the best anecdotes ever written and reported abut the kings and queens of England, across the full range of Britain's history from the first century A.D. to the present day.     Scholars and versifiers, lawgivers and saints crowd the pages alongside soldiers, scallywags, and imbeciles, and never have these distant figures been brought more vividly to life than in this splendid anthology.  We read of Alfred's burnt cakes, Cnut and the wolves, Henry VIII and his six wives, George III resigning himself to American independence, Edward VII's gambling habits, and much more.  There are samplings of royal wit (as when James I said of John Donne's poetry:  Dr Donne's verses are like the peace of God; they pass all understanding.\"), of royal modesty (as in Elizabeth II's explanation of why she wore no crown at the musician Robert Mayer's 100th birthday party:  \"I thought it was Sir Robert's night, not mine.\"), and of royal certitude (as in Victoria's comment during a dark moment of the Boer War: \"Please understand that there is no one depressed this house; we are not interested in the possibilities of defeat; they do not exist.\")     The Countess of Longford's helpful commentary clarifies the complexities of royal genealogy and adds a sharp and often humorous perspective to bygone events. Her sources range from the earliest medieval chroniclers to biographers and historians of today, from dispassionate descriptions to intimate and revealing accounts from the letters and journals of the monarchs themselves.  The result is truly a historical feast fit for a king.",

        "Authors": "By Stephenson, Sherry (EDT)",
        "Description": "The services sector?including financial services, telecommunications, transportation, tourism, and professional services?has become critical to the continued economic dynamism in the Americas. And the quality and competitiveness of this sector are essential to economic growth and development. On average, services?increasingly traded in more numerous and far-reaching ways than goods?account for nearly two-thirds of the gross domestic product of the Western Hemisphere. The importance of the sector, however, is disproportionately large in Central America and the Caribbean, where it often is the major source of employment and of foreign exchange.This timely volume is the first to review and analyze trade agreements covering the services sector in the Western Hemisphere and their relationship to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), in force since 1995 as an integral part of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Negotiations on liberalizing services trade are continuing at the multilateral, the regional or hemispheric, and the subregional levels. It is imperative to understand what is being discussed and implemented at these different levels and to articulate the linkages and relationships among the various agreements and the disciplines and obligations they contain. Services Trade in the Western Hemisphere informs the reader about these issues and more. Part 1 deals with the main issues relevant to the liberalization of services trade at the multilateral and regional levels, including improvements to the GATS architecture, the scope of regulatory reform, the relationship between the treatment of services and investment, WTO requirements that must be fulfilled by parties to an economic integration agreement, and disagreements brought to the multilateral dispute settlement process. Part 2 examines the scope, content, and liberalizing approach of subregional agreements in the Western Hemisphere, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and those promulgated by the Andean Community, as well as several bilateral free trade agreements covering services, in particular those signed by Mexico, Chile, and Central America. Part 3 evaluates the extent of liberalization of services trade achieved to date at the multilateral and subregional levels and discusses options for improvements in the context of the ongoing Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations.",

        "Title": "The Bone Vault: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Fairstein, Linda A.",
        "Description": "The New York Times bestselling author and renowned former Manhattan prosecutor follows her Nero Award-winning The Deadhouse with a mesmerizing new Alexandra Cooper novel set at the crossroads of big money, high culture, and murder...  The Bone Vault begins in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's glorious Temple of Dendur, where wealthy donors have gathered to celebrate a controversial new exhibit.  An uneasy mix of scholarship, showbiz, and aggressive marketing, \"A Modern Bestiary\" will be a joint venture of the Met and the American Museum of Natural History. With its IMAX time trips and Rembrandt refrigerator magnets, the \"Bestiary\" has raised fierce opposition from some of New York's museum elite.  Assistant DA Alexandra Cooper, off duty for the evening, observes the developing tensions with bemused interest until Met director Pierre Thibodaux pulls her aside. He needs her advice. There's an urgent problem out at a loading dock on a New Jersey pier.  A Twelfth Dynasty mummified princess, enclosed for eternity in a huge stone sarcophagus, is about to take a long voyage to Cairo as part of a routine museum exchange. But Cleopatra is missing, and in her place is the not-so-mummified body of a woman many centuries younger than her royal predecessor.  Who is this woman with the small physique, the dark hair, and the shiny barrette? What is her connection, if any, to the rarefied world of priceless art and objects? And how and when did she become entombed in the sarcophagus?  Teaming with cops Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace, Alex must explore behind the scenes at the elegant but severe Metropolitan, travel uptown to the remote setting of the Cloisters and its medieval trove of funerary art, and on to the massive array of beasts and bones at the Museum of Natural History. Somewhere deep within the bowels of one of these great cultural centers, a killer may wait.  Atmospheric, chilling, and rich with the kind of procedural authenticity that only Linda Fairstein can provide, The Bone Vault is a page-turning tour de force from one of crime writing's brightest stars.",

        "Title": "American Folk Masters: The National Heritage Fellows",
        "Authors": "By Siporin, Steve",
        "Description": "American Folk Masters celebrates the lives and work of nearly 150 National Heritage Fellows, named since 1982 as exemplary practitioners of traditional folk arts. Sometimes likened to Japan's Living National Treasures, the Fellows are selected each year by the Folk Arts Program of the National Endowment for the Arts for their achievements in a wide variety of visual and performing folk arts.The National Heritage Fellows come from Maine and Hawaii, from Alaska and Puerto Rico, and from most states in between. A random roll call of even a few of their names - Duff Severe, Periklis Halkias, Canray Fontenot, Alice New Holy Blue Legs - reflects America's rich ethnic diversity. And the same diversity characterizes the arts the Fellows practice, which range from blues music, pottery, tap dancing, and lace making to Lakota quillwork, Sicilian marionette theater, African-American story-telling, and Hawaiian quiltmaking.Published on the tenth anniversary of the National Heritage Fellowships, this volume was inspired by an exhibition organized by the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe. Its fifty full-page color photographs show the compelling, beautifully crafted objects made by the visual artists among the Fellows, while its black-and-white portraits and personal quotations capture the fascinating backgrounds and personalities of these people.Steve Siporin, folklorist and Associate Professor at Utah State University, has written a lively yet thoughtful essay that considers the Fellows as inheritors, innovators, and conservers of tradition. There are contributions by Bess Lomax Hawes, Director of the Folk Arts Program of the National Endowment for the Arts (1977-92), and Barre Toelken, Professor of Folklore at Utah State University. A comprehensive illustrated Directory of all the Fellows from the last ten years includes an invaluable bibliography, discography, and filmography.The first full-length study of a groundbreaking program, American Folk Masters has much to offer anyone who values our national heritage. Whether descendants of the original Native peoples or members of the newest immigrant group, we can all learn from these consummate artists who are keeping our folk traditions alive today.",

        "Authors": "By Davies Paul",
        "Description": "How did the universe begin and how will it end? What is matter? What is mind, and can it survive death? What are time and space, and how do they relate to ideas about God? Is the order of the universe the result of accident or design?  The most profound and age-old questions of existence -- for centuries the focus of religion and philosophy -- may soon be answered through the extraordinary advances of a field of science known as the new physics. In this illuminating work, Paul Davies, author of the acclaimed Other Worlds and The Edge of Infinity, writes that the discoveries of 20th-century physics -- relativity and the quantum theory -- are now pointing the way to a new appreciation of man and his place in the universe. They could, in fact, bring within our grasp a unified description of all creation. Demanding a radical reformulation of the most fundamental aspects of reality and a way of thinking that is in closer accord with mysticism than materialism, the new physics, says Davies, offers a surer path to God than religion.  Described by The Washington Post as \"impressive,\" God and the New Physics is a fascinating look at the impact of science on what were formerly religious issues. Elegantly written, a book for both scholars and lay readers of science, it is, according to the Christian Science Monitor, a \"provocative...rewarding intellectual romp.\"",

        "Description": "A Tale of One City  It was the best of times, it was the best of times; it was a season of pinstripes, it was a season of amazin'; it was the autumn of Sinatra, it was the autumn of Baha Men; it was a time of the 7 train, it was a time of the 4 and the D. In short, the period was so like other glorious times that it inspired chanting in the streets, division in the taverns, and a giddy nostalgia in the hearts of all who watched and cheered.  The 2000 World Series pitted the New York Yankees and their winning tradition against the New York Mets and their history of miracles. These two outstanding teams breathed new life into the words that characterized the city's halcyon hardball past: subway series. Older generations followed the action with one eye on the games of today while the other viewed black-and-white film of the past: Derek Jeter strokes a home run, and Hank Bauer rounds the bases; Al Leiter rocks back, and Johnny Podres delivers the pitch. New generations experienced thrills they'll tell their own grandchildren one day: \"Yes, I saw Mariano Rivera pitch....\" \"I was sitting right there when Todd Zeile's drive hit the top of the wall....\"  To celebrate the return of New York to the center of the baseball universe, Pete Hamill, legendary columnist, editor, and author of Snow in August and A Drinking Life: A Memoir, has assembled an all-star team of writers to create the ultimate thinking fan's keepsake of the subway series. The Subway Series Reader spans the generations of baseball in New York, from Lawrence Ritter's recollection of attending his first World Series game in the subway series of 1936 to Peter Knobler's reflection on bringing his son to the Series in 2000. With contributors running the gamut from Frank McCourt to Yogi Berra, The Subway Series Reader contains all of the best of what made the millennium World Series one for the ages. When it comes to World Series teams and the city that loves them, The Subway Series Reader -- thoughtful, nostalgic, graceful, charming, exciting, and up-to-the-minute -- is the one book to have when you're having more than one.",

        "Title": "Taking Heat: The President, the Press, and My Years in the White House",
        "Authors": "By Fleischer, Ari",
        "Description": "The early years of the twenty-first century were a tumultuous time in America. The country faced a hotly contested presidential election, the largest terrorist attack in the nation's history, and the early stages of war. Through it all, President George W. Bush surrounded himself with a handful of close advisers. During this time the man beside the President was Ari Fleischer, his press secretary and one of his most trusted confidants. In this role, Fleisher was present for every decision and became an eyewitness to history.In this riveting account, Fleischer goes behind the scenes as he recalls his experiences in the West Wing. Through the ups and downs of this time, he took the heat, fielded the questions, and brought the President's message into living rooms around the world.In Taking Heat, Fleischer, for the first time, gives his perspective on:The 2000 election, from the recounts to the transition to powerSeptember 11, 2001, its aftermath, and the anthrax scareThe pressure-filled buildup to the war in Iraq and the President's thoughts as the war beganLife in the White House, from learning to adjust to the pace of the West Wing and his early briefings to his relationship with the pressThe White House press corps, who they are, and how they report the newsThe factors that led to his decision to leave Washington behind.This is the story of the men and women of the White House press corps and the cornerstones of democracy: freedom of speech and the freedom of the press. Fleischer presents an in-depth, insider's view on the Washington political arena from a perspective few have seen.Fleischer writes of his belief that the press has a bias in Washington. It's not a question of partisanship or press-driven ideology. Instead, it's a focus on conflict, particularly if it's a conflict they can attach to the President. It's the nature of the White House press corps, regardless of who's in power. The members of the White House press corps are masters at being devil's advocate, able to take with passion the opposite side of whatever issue the President supports. Fleischer's job was to calmly field their questions, no matter how pointed.Taking Heat is an introspective exploration of the top political events in the first half of the Bush administration, as well as the candid observations of a professional who stood in the bright lights of the world stage.",

        "Title": "The American Presidency, 1945-2000: Illusions of Grandeur",
        "Authors": "By Bennett, G. H.",
        "Description": "This volume explores the radical changes in the historical role of the president since 1945, with an opening chapter looking at the evolving nature of the office from the 18th to the 20th century. The central argument is that after 1945, as the issue of national security became the dominant theme of American politics, the power of the presidency increased enormously. The outbreak of the Cold War and the passing of the National Security Act in 1947, setting up the CIA, gave the president unparalleled powers. Presidents could now exercise power in the name of, but not always with the consent of, the American people. The paranoia of successive presidents is another theme of the book, from Truman's and Kennedy's fear of Communism, through to Johnson's and Nixon's fears of political intrigues and rivals. Watergate and its impact on presidential power through Ford and Carter is fully explored, as is the reassertion of strong presidential leadership through a dynamic foreign policy under Reagan and Bush. The crisis of the presidency, with the American people groping backwards to the notion of a caretaker president who does nothing wrong, rather than an activist president, forms the final section. As chief executive of the only remaining superpower, the US president occupies a unique political space. Giving equal weight to domestic and foreign concerns, Harry Bennett offers an account of this key area of contemporary political history.",

        "Description": "Based on a comprehensive national study of high-school students, Beyond the Classroom explains that it is parents and peers, not teachers, who have the greatest influence over a student's classroom performance. The reason so many students do badly in school is not that their schools are deficient but that their parents either don't care about their children's performance or don't show their children in positive ways that they do. Children who know that their parents value eduction perform much better in school than other children.The other great influence on school performance, according to the study reported in this book, is the peer group. Children are strongly influenced by their friends' attitudes toward school. As a group, children whose friends believe that hard work earns rewards and who value good grades do well in school. Unfortunately, according to the study, fewer than one-fifth of all students say that their friends believe it is important to get good grades. For the most part, adolescent peer culture demeans school success and scorns those students who try to do well in school. The peer culture is so powerful that it can even undermine the positive contributions of parents.The study on which this book is based also found striking and consistent ethnic differences in student performance, differences that cut across socioeconomic groups. African-American and Latino students lag behind their peers while Asian-American students - even in the very same school - perform at the highest levels. Beyond the Classroom explains why this is and offers answers that will help all students, regardless of ethnic background, to do better in school.Beyond the Classroom identifies the real nature of the education crisis in America. It explains why some students succeed brilliantly while others founder and draws valuable lessons about the nature of successful parental and peer group support.",

In this powerful and moving book - the first intimate account written by an A.D. sufferer - McGowin not only chronicles her battle against devastating illness but captures forever the thoughts that for her have become all too fleeting.The haunting feeling that there is less of you today than there was yesterday. The unceasing pressure to \"pass\" as healthy - and the terrifying struggle to accept the fact that you are not. These are the bittersweet emotions and terrible anxieties that all Alzheimer's sufferers share - but rarely voice. With unflinching honesty, Diana McGowin reveals what it is like to forget your children's names, to have a lifetime of professional achievement wiped from your memory...to inhabit a healthy body with an ebbing mind. And with heart-wrenching clarity, she describes how dementia transforms the family, turning unprepared spouses and children into ill-equipped and sometimes unwilling caregivers.But her message is ultimately one of hope. With extraordinary eloquence and compassion, McGowin reaches out to offer her \"fellow travelers\" the simple comforts they need most: a sense of direction rather than destination - and the hope of healing whether or not there is a cure.",

        "Description": "If you have ever worried -- and who hasn't? -- whether the investment decisions you are making are the right ones, then Mary Farrell's Beyond the Basics can help you cut through the clutter of conflicting advice and reach a new level of successful investing.  Mary Farrell is famous for her investment advice, not only in her work as an investment strategist and managing director of PaineWebber, but also as one of the panelists and occasional substitute host of Wall $treet Week With Louis Rukeyser. Building on the knowledge you already have, she offers new ways of thinking about your money and tells you which investment strategies can make mega-differences in your investment results. Her book covers everything from mutual funds and fixed-income investments to important retirement -- and estate -- planning vehicles such as bypass trusts. She details the crucial process of organizing goals, developing a framework for sophisticated asset allocation, and then selecting and monitoring investments -- always deepening your level of knowledge.  Mary Farrell recognizes that few investors can anticipate short-term movements in the stock market successfully and make money by constantly buying and selling shares. Instead of wasting all your waking hours monitoring scores of economic variables and dozens of financial markets, you will learn a safer, simpler way to profit through thematic investing over the long term. Farrell reveals the major trends that will radically reshape the American economy and offer opportunities for investors who are prepared and who know where to look.  Investment risk is an area that is difficult to measure accurately, even by professionals, but one of the unique features of this book is the risk/reward ratio it provides for virtually every major type of investment. Packed with practical strategies, proven techniques, and fresh insights, Mary Farrell's Beyond the Basics can become the key to your investment success.",

In The Goddess in the Gospels the author tells how she was guided in her ever-deepening study of the New Testament and the gematria--number coding of the Greek alphabet--by an incredible series of synchronicities that mirror the inner and outer worlds and which reveal the Sacred Marriage of male and female--the hieros gamous--leading to her own personal redemption.",

        "Title": "Declining Fortunes: The Withering Of The American Dream",
        "Authors": "By Newman, Katherine S.",
        "Description": "American society has reneged on its promise to the baby-boom generation. Young people for the first time find themselves unable to duplicate, let alone surpass, their own parents' standard of living. Although the media are filled with images of high-living yuppies, the realities for this generation of adults are far bleaker: home ownership rates are falling precipitously, pink slips cascade from corporate headquarters, and costs of raising a family rise threateningly.How are Americans coming to grips with declining fortunes? Based on years of probing research and candid interviews with postwar suburban parents and their baby-boom children, this book provides an unblinking look at the damage that economic decline has done to the people of America - damage reflected in taxpayer revolts, anger at the urban underclass, and fury at the nation's political elites.With insight and sensitivity, Katherine S. Newman explores all the disturbing implications of a trend that shows every indication of being a long-range phenomenon. She discusses the pressures on young mothers to stay at home - pressures that they can scarcely afford to indulge - and the frustration (often mixed with disdain) of elderly parents unable to see why their children can't \"make it\" as they did, \"pulling themselves up by the bootstraps.\" She examines the growing xenophobia toward affluent Asian newcomers. And she points out the rift between counterculture baby boomers who came of age in the 1960s and those who grew up in the \"me decade\" of the 1970s, revealing that the baby-boom generation is a generation divided against itself.Here is a book that sheds new light on the driving issue of our day: downward mobility and the politics of resentment.",

It would be wonderful if they came to us unsummoned, but particularly in lives as  busy as the ones most of us lead now, that won\u2019t happen. We have to teach ourselves  now to live, really live . . . to love the journey, not the destination.\u201d In this treasure  of a book, Anna Quindlen, the bestselling novelist and columnist, reflects on what  it takes to \u201cget a life\u201d\u2014to live deeply every day and from your own unique self,  rather than merely to exist through your days. \u201cKnowledge of our own mortality is  the greatest gift God ever gives us,\u201d\u00a0Quindlen writes, \u201cbecause unless you know the  clock is ticking, it is so easy to waste our days, our lives.\u201d\u00a0Her mother died when  Quindlen was nineteen: \u201cIt was the dividing line between seeing the world in black  and white, and in Technicolor. The lights came on for the darkest possible reason. . . . I  learned something enduring, in a very short period of time, about life. And that  was that it was glorious, and that you had no business taking it for granted.\u201d\u00a0But  how to live from that perspective, to fully engage in our days? In A Short Guide  to a Happy Life, Quindlen guides us with an understanding that comes from knowing  how to see the view, the richness in living.",

        "Description": "In 1987, Terry Waite was in Beirut working for the release of the hostages when he was taken prisoner and put in solitary confinement. For the first year, he was given nothing to read. During those days he passed the endless hours by writing his autobiography in his head, and by remembering the books, stories, and poems he had read before his captivity. Eventually his guards relented, and he was given books. The first book he received was Beyond Euphrates by Freya Stark, followed by an English translation of the Koran, and later such classics as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, The First Circle, and The Brothers Karamazov. However, the guards' limited knowledge of English resulted in Terry receiving books on child care, breastfeeding, and even one detailing escapes from prison camps in World War II. Desperate for words, Terry read them all cover to cover.Here he has collected excerpts from his favorite books read during confinement, the ones he remembered from his past, and the ones he wished he had been given. This is a journey through one man's mind; his depression, loneliness, and later, the emergence of his faith and spirit despite extremely trying circumstances. Interspersed between selections are Terry's own reflections on these books and his reasons for including them.",

        "Description": "Everywhere organizations are attempting to \"reinvent\" themselves. The old, unresponsive bureaucracy simply doesn't work in today's volatile, open, global business environment. However, the computing systems in today's organization seem unable to deliver the goods for corporate rebirth. They are limited in function, and expensive, and seem to take forever to change.Here's a book that explains how a new era of technology can enable the transition to the new enterprise and business success. It shows managers and professionals with little or no technical background how to take action NOW to achieve short-term benefits of this technology and position their organizations for long-term transformation.Based on a series of multimillion dollar investigations of more than 4,500 businesses and government organizations, Paradigm Shift examines and synthesizes the recent experiences of leading edge companies in making the transition to the second era.The book reveals the promise of the new technology in creating the open, networked, \"client/server\" enterprise - altering virtually every facet of today's business operations, including the impact of work-group computing and business process reengineering in building a network of high performance business teams; enterprise computing in achieving the integrated competitive organization; and interenterprise computing in extending the react of companies to their customers, suppliers, business partners, and even competitors.You'll learn how major shifts in the nature of information technology are enabling previously unimagined breakthroughs in its use and useability: the shift from proprietary to open systems; the shift from host-based to network-based systems; and the shift from software craft to software manufacturing.Most important you will learn critical insights into how to make the transition to the second era enterprise.Drawing on the recent experiences of such diverse companies as Toys 'R' Us, Sears Roebuck, Four Seasons Hotels, Otis Elevator, and Federal Express, this cutting-edge book provides all the information you'll need to succeed in today's new high-tech, high-stakes business environment!",
