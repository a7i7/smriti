        "Description": "A visionary work that explores the limits of violence and charts an unexpectedly hopeful course toward a nonviolent futureAt times of global crisis, Jonathan Schell\u2019s writings have presented influential alternatives to conventional, dead-end thinking.  His classic bestseller, The Fate of the Earth, was hailed by The New York Times as \u201can event of profound historical moment.\u201d Now as the world stands once more on the brink of upheaval, Schell reenters the fray with a lucid, impassioned, and provocative book that points the way out of the unparalleled devastation of the twentieth century toward another, more peaceful path.Tracing the relentless expansion of violence to its culmination in nuclear stalemate, Schell uncovers a simultaneous but little-noted history of nonviolent action at every level of political life. His historical journey turns up seeds of nonviolence even in the bloody revolutions of America, France, and Russia, as well as in the people\u2019s wars of China and Vietnam. And his investigations into the great nonviolent events of modern times\u2014from Gandhi\u2019s independence movement in India to the explosion of civic activity that brought about the surprising collapse of the Soviet Union\u2014suggest foundations of an entirely new kind on which to construct an enduring peace.As Schell makes clear, all-out war, with its risk of human extinction, must cease to play the role of final arbiter. The Unconquerable World is a bold book of global significance; far from being utopian, it offers the only realistic hope of safety.",

Those Americans would remain hostage for over one year. This is the story of how, in a heretofore unimaginable sequence of events, a seemingly ragtag mob of students inspired by a barely known Muslim cleric named Khomeini eventually undid an American president.It is a story that spans a century, full of famous characters--like Carter, Khomeini, and the Shah--and those who worked in the shadows. Cross-cutting between Washington, Tehran, Paris, and training centers for the doomed Desert One rescue mission, THE CRISIS is a work of history that reads like a thriller. Full of never-before-reported details, and drawing for the first time on comprehensive interviews with the Iranians involved, as well as fresh discussions with the central American players, this book is David Harriss masterpiece--what hes been building up to for decades.",

She is certainly one of the world's best-known and best-loved art critics, familiar to millions from her wildly popular art series on PBS.In Sister Wendy's American Collection, she visits six of America's most prestigious museums: the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City), the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston, Massachusetts), the Art Institute of Chicago, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Kimbell Art Museum (Fort Worth, Texas), and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In each, Sister Wendy chooses a wide variety of artpaintings, sculpture, porcelain figures-and draws attention to the small details of the work, revealing hidden meanings and symbolism. She relates the background of the artist and explains the techniques and the histories behind each work in a straightforward language that speaks to all with humor and insight.More than 250 full-color illustrations illuminate Sister Wendy's text. Sister Wendy's American Collection is a wonderful tour of six great American museums -- it is also the equivalent of taking a personal tour with Sister Wendy, studying and enjoying her favorite pieces of art, chosen from across the whole breadth of history to the present. It is a fascinating journey, one that can be taken again and again. Sister Wendy's American Collection is soon to be a PBS miniseries.",

As a woman you were odd if you graduated from college without being married; if you were married, you were odd if you didn't immediately have children; if you had children, you were odd if you also wanted to work. Before the feminist movement, women were treated as second-class citizens whose roles were utterly restricted, and The Fifties: A Women's Oral History fully explores those roles, the women who lived them, and the women who broke the molds.Filled with moving and revealing stories from a broad canvas of women speaking in their own words, The Fifties tells what it really was like to be a \"good girl,\" to get an illegal abortion, to try against all odds for an advanced academic degree, to raise children and keep a home in the suburbs, to follow your dreams of having a profession, and even to live, politically and sexually, far from the mainstream of American life. These are stories of women's lives - some very tragic, some remarkably heroic - and they reveal to us all over again an era we thought we knew so well.",

Payne at Pinehurst shows how Stewart dealt with his stunning U.S. Open defeat in 1998 and planned victory for the championship that meant so much to him.            Stewart's conquest of Pinehurst No. 2, while fending off Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, David Duval, and Vijay Singh in an epic battle where every swing held significance, is the stuff of which golf legends are made. From compelling action by the best golfers in the world to the tournament's dramatic conclusion, Payne at Pinehurst shows readers why the 1999 U.S. Open is regarded as the best U.S. Open ever played.\"Exciting golf history combined with the poignant personal story of Stewart's life and death.\"---Booklist\"You don't have to be from North Carolina to understand what happened at the 1999 U.S. Open, and how it felt; it was an Open brushed by an angel's wing, an Open that in retrospect seems almost fictional....

From this backwater outpost, Stark set forth on what was to be her most unforgettable adventure: Following the ancient frankincense routes of the Hadhramaut Valley, the most fertile in Arabia, she sought to be the first Westerner to locate and document the lost city of Shabwa. Chronicling her journey through the towns and encampments of the Hadhramaut, The Southern Gates of Arabia is a tale alive with sheikhs and sultans, tragedy and triumph. Although the claim to discovering Shabwa would not ultimately be Stark's, The Southern Gates of Arabia, a bestseller upon its original publication, remains a classic in the literature of travel. This edition includes a new Introduction by Jane Fletcher Geniesse, Stark's biographer.",

For in this world where poetry held the power of enchantment, Saul's love of verse made him a puissant wizard. And his search for his missing friend soon earned him a fearsome foe: a false monarch without peer in the realms of wickedness and corruption.Queen Suettay was a mistress of magic in her own right. She had entire armies at her beck and call, steeped in evil and ready to obey her every command. And Suettay was determined to break Saul's power - or win his soul for her malefic master...Saul rallied troops of his own, of course: Gruesome the troll, young squire Gilbert, an overworked guardian angel, a hand of the wee folk, and the beautiful - if insubstantial - Angelique. But it would take much more than a hardy little band to overthrow Suettay's reign of terror. Only with the aid of the legendary and mysterious Spider King could Saul spin a web to trap a tyrant...",

Dozens of stories are told, each in the context of its time, with evocative illustrations to inspire today's readers. Nature miracles recounted include Christ walking on the water and his feeding of five thousand disciples. Healing miracles include Christ's healing of the ten lepers and his raising of Lazarus from the dead. Later miracles include the dramatic conversion of Roman Emperor Constantine to Christianity in AD 312, and the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, Poland, which for centuries has protected its monastery from sieges by outsiders. Here too are accounts of miraculous apparitions of the Virgin Mary by St. James the Apostle, Bernadette of Lourdes, and the three children at Fatima Portugal. Accounts of other miracles involve the Shroud of Turin, the works of St. Francis of Assisi, and the vision of the Italian monk, Padre Pio, who reportedly protected his church from bombing during World War II. This fascinating and inspiring book is beautifully produced, and includes more than 130 color illustrations.",

        "Description": "\"I'll leave as soon as you give me what I want.\" In another time and place, that might have a nice ring to it. But standing in a Chicago hotel room with a cub reporter as obstinate as she is hot, FBI agent Derek Knight knows he has to play it charming. Something like, \"By holding on to that evidence, you're interfering with FBI business, ma'am, and by the way, those long, gorgeous legs of yours would look awfully good wrapped around my.  .  .\" Sure, losing all sense of professionalism may not help his career, but the off-duty perks would be sensational.  .  . \"Yeah, right, you're an FBI agent. And I can bake a cake from scratch.\" Reese Hampton is not giving up the envelope she found in her rental car--the one with the story that could take her from journalistic Siberia straight to the front page. She'll just have to outsmart the certifiably insane Fed with the movie-star good looks. Dodge and weave. Distract and bed. No! Bad hormones, bad! Still, spending time with that unbelievably broad chest up close and personal might just add, um, depth to her story. If only she can let her robe down while keeping her guard up.  .  .",

        "Title": "While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West from Within",
        "Authors": "By Bawer, Bruce",
        "Description": "The struggle for the soul of Europe today is every bit as dire and consequential as it was in the 1930s. Then, in Weimar, Germany, the center did not hold, and the light of civilization nearly went out. Today, the continent has entered yet another \u201cWeimar moment.\u201d Will Europeans rise to the challenge posed by radical Islam, or will they cave in once again to the extremists?As an American living in Europe since 1998, Bruce Bawer has seen this problem up close. Across the continent\u2014in Amsterdam, Oslo, Copenhagen, Paris, Berlin, Madrid, and Stockholm\u2014he encountered large, rapidly expanding Muslim enclaves in which women were oppressed and abused, homosexuals persecuted and killed, \u201cinfidels\u201d threatened and vilified, Jews demonized and attacked, barbaric traditions (such as honor killing and forced marriage) widely practiced, and freedom of speech and religion firmly repudiated.  The European political and media establishment turned a blind eye to all this, selling out women, Jews, gays, and democratic principles generally\u2014even criminalizing free speech\u2014in order to pacify the radical Islamists and preserve the illusion of multicultural harmony. The few heroic figures who dared to criticize Muslim extremists and speak up for true liberal values were systematically slandered as fascist bigots. Witnessing the disgraceful reaction of Europe\u2019s elites to 9/11, to the terrorist attacks on Madrid, Beslan, and London, and to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Bawer concluded that Europe was heading inexorably down a path to cultural suicide.Europe's Muslim communities are powder kegs, brimming with an alienation born of the immigrants\u2019 deep antagonism toward an infidel society that rejects them and compounded by misguided immigration policies that enforce their segregation and empower the extremists in their midst. The mounting crisis produced by these deeply perverse and irresponsible policies finally burst onto our television screens in October 2005, as Paris and other European cities erupted in flames.WHILE EUROPE SLEPT is the story of one American\u2019s experience in Europe before and after 9/11, and of his many arguments with Europeans about the dangers of militant Islam and America\u2019s role in combating it.  This brave and invaluable book\u2014with its riveting combination of eye-opening reportage and blunt, incisive analysis\u2014is essential reading for anyone concerned about the fate of Europe and what it portends for the United States.",
