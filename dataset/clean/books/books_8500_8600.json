        "Authors": "By Evans, William, Rosenberg, Irwin H., and Thompson, Jacqueline",
        "Description": "Exciting new evidence from the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University has demonstrated that the body's decline is due not to the passing of years but to the combined effects of inactivity, poor nutrition, and illness -- much of which can be controlled. This breakthrough study shows that regardless of your age or present physical condition, the aging process can be slowed -- or even reversed!  The authors have identified ten \"biomarkers,\" the key physiological factors associated with prolonged youth and vitality:  * lean body (muscle) mass * strength * basal metabolic rate * body fat percentage * aerobic capacity * blood pressure * Insulin sensitivity * cholesterol/HDL ratio * bone density * body temperature regulation  With only 50 minutes a day of aerobic exercise and strength training (a pivotal component of the 16-week Bioaction Plan), even middle-aged \"couch potatoes\" and older adults can:  * regain muscle loss and increase strength by as much as 200 percent * reenergize the body and actually lose body fat * increase aerobic capacity by up to 20 percent * reduce the chances of developing age-related conditions such as heart disease, Type II diabetes, and osteoporosis  Providing dietary guidelines, self-tests for evaluating your physiological age, and exercise programs for every level of fitness, Biomarkers will change forever the way you think -- and what you do -- about aging.",

Where do I begin?\u201d In this practical guide to capturing those memories that have been stored away, Linda Spence provides the questions that are the keys to unlocking the memories that make up a life.Beyond the vital statistics are the personal stories that tell what it was like, what we did, and why we did it, how we feel about our choices, and what our circumstances were. Through encouraging coaching, shared memories, and open-ended questions, the process of producing a personal history becomes intriguing and engaging.With Legacy the possibilities expand: a personal record is preserved\u2014with its myths, traditions, joys, pains, gains, and losses; a family opens a potential dialogue that will last for generations; the writer has an opportunity for insight and resolution; the culture of a time and place is noted; the tradition of personal story is revitalized, and our present and future find nourishment and knowledge in the past.Either as a gift that can act as a shared experience as the memories are recounted or as a personal way to take account of one\u2019s experiences, often long since forgotten, Legacy is indeed a way to get one\u2019s story down.",

        "Description": "Following an eccentric band of storm chasers during tornado season, a writer delves deep into our fascination with catastrophic weatherWhy do some people chase the kind of storms that would send most people running for their lives? Why is it that devastating weather-and tornadoes in particular-maintain a primal hold on our collective imagination? How to account for the spectacular success of a company like the Weather Channel-not just a show, but an entire cable network with 86 million regular viewers, hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue, and one abiding subject, the passing clouds? With his guide Matt Biddle, an Ahab-like veteran storm chaser, Mark Svenvold draws a portrait of a culture enamored by extremes during a 6,000-mile journey through Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. Along the way, the author encounters an assortment of characters out of a Fellini film: A duo named The Twister Sisters, from St. Cloud, Minnesota; a crowd-pleasing trio from CUPP (California University of Pennsylvania-at Pittsburgh); a team of chaser-scientists who have partnered with an IMAX film-maker from Los Angeles with an armor-plated truck; and a stock car racer from North Carolina whose goal is to drive through a tornado. At the heart of the excitement are the awe-inspiring events themselves-a tornado that levels a small Nebraska town and the look back at the central Oklahoma tornado outbreak that included the single-most destructive tornado in US history. Similar weather disasters occur each spring in a kind of reverse lottery that has spawned a subculture of catastrophilia. Want to know what a tornado actually sounds like as it blows over or through your house? Big Weather answers this while also tracing the ways the sublime, in the classic sense, still has a profound claim upon our imagination. Big Weather is a wryly observed meditation upon the weather as block-buster event that explores, with an ironic touch, our paradoxical relationship to the biggest story of our age-global warming-and the fate of the earth.",

Then you must read Coping with a Picky Eater. This fresh, practical, and realistic guide explains to parents how they can avoid mealtime battles with kids aged one to six years, using sensible strategies that will establish a lifetime of healthful eating habits.  With cases ranging from the toddler who eats only peanut butter and jelly on white bread to the six-year-old who insists on scrambled eggs and cheese at every meal, pediatrician William G. Wilkoff, M.D., has been counseling picky eaters and their concerned parents for more than twenty years. Debunking common myths and soothing parents' fears, Dr. Wilkoff covers such practical matters as:   providing appropriate nutritional guidelines for youngsters one to six, including serving sizes; dealing with nutritional saboteurs -- from indulgent grandparents to accommodating (or impatient) caregivers; resisting the temptation to \"whip up\" special orders that disrupt family meals and give the picky eater control over the family dynamic.   Dr. Wilkoff shows that by establishing reasonable rules when children are young, parents can not only eliminate daily fights about food, but also reduce the possibility of eating disorders later in life.",

        "Description": "For more than twenty-five years, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has made children her passion and her cause. Her long experience with children -- not only through her personal roles as mother, daughter, sister, and wife but also as advocate, legal expert, and public servant -- has strengthened her conviction that how children develop and what they need to succeed are inextricably entwined with the society in which they live and how well it sustains and supports its families and individuals. In other words, it takes a village to raise a child.  This book chronicles her quest -- both deeply personal and, in the truest sense, public -- to discover how we can make our society into the kind of village that enables children to grow into able, caring, resilient adults. It is time, Mrs. Clinton believes, to acknowledge that we have to make some changes for our children's sake. Advances in technology and the global economy along with other developments society have brought us much good, but they have also strained the fabric of family life, leaving us and our children poorer in many ways -- physically, intellectually, emotionally, spiritually.  She doesn't believe that we should, or can, turn back the clock to \"the good old days.\" False nostalgia for \"family values\" is no solution. Nor is it useful to make an all-purpose bogeyman or savior of \"government.\" But by looking honestly at the condition of our children, by understanding the wealth of new information research offers us about them, and, most important, by listening to the children themselves, we can begin a more fruitful discussion about their needs. And by sifting the past for clues to the structures that once bound us together, by looking with an open mind at what other countries and cultures do for their children that we do not, and by identifying places where our \"village\" is flourishing -- in families, schools, churches, businesses, civic organizations, even in cyberspace -- we can begin to create for our children the better tomorrow they deserve.",

        "Title": "Understanding Depression: A Complete Guide to Its Diagnosis and Treatment",
        "Authors": "By Wender, Paul H. and Klein, Donald F.",
        "Description": "Recent studies have found that one woman in five, and one man in ten, will suffer from depression or manic depression sometime during the course of their lives. This is a disturbing statistic, but there is hope, because more and more evidence has surfaced to indicate that many psychiatric disorders are biological diseases that can be successfully treated with medication. Most people, however, know little about these recent findings. They don't know how to tell if the depression they are suffering from is biological or not, nor what they can do to recover from it if it is. In Understanding Depression, Donald Klein and Paul Wender offer a definitive guide to depressive illness--its causes, course, and symptoms. They clarify the difference between depression (which is a normal emotion) and biological depression (which is an illness), and include several self-rating tests with which readers can determine whether or not they should seek psychiatric evaluation to determine if they have a biological depressive illness. They describe the symptoms of biological depression, among them loss of energy, changes in eating habits, sleep disturbances, decreased sex drive, restlessness, poor concentration and indecisiveness, and increased use of intoxicants and drugs. And they paint a clear picture of how depressive illness can affect people's lives, using excerpts from patient histories to show the progress of each patient from the onset of depression to treatment and recovery. The authors also discuss the different types of treatment available, including antidepressant drugs, electroconvulsive therapy, and psychotherapy, and they examine the benefits and side effects of psychopharmacological drugs (including the new antidepressants, lithium, and the controversial Prozac), related disorders (such as panic attacks, atypical depression, seasonal affective disorder, and PMS), and how to get the right kind of help. Most victims of biological depression often fail to seek help, whether out of guilt or ignorance, and many are often misdiagnosed by physicians or psychotherapists who fail to recognize the symptoms of the illness. Understanding Depression  seeks to make the public (both lay and medical) aware of the issues of biological depression, providing a highly informed and readable guide to this much misunderstood disease.",

Beattie's book, begun as a project for a university class he was teaching, is the first to focus on this notorious killer. It is possible that publicity surrounding the upcoming book may be what inspired BTK to begin sending messages to the police again after 25 years of silence, messages which eventually led to Rader's arrest.

        "Title": "Restoring Faith: America's Religious Leaders Answer Terror with Hope",
        "Authors": "By Church, F. Forrester (EDT)",
        "Description": "During the week following the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, Americans gathered in unprecedented numbers to seek comfort and guidance from their religious leaders. Regardless of creed, the same questions echoed from the pews. Where can we find God amidst the rubble? How can we answer hate with greater love? Is there hope for peace or are the trumpets of Armageddon less distant than before? These were the questions ministers, priests, imams and rabbis had to address from their pulpits. Even as they spoke, the soul map of our nation was being recharted. The preachers' daunting task was to bring hope and direction to a people newly lost. Each of these sermons, by some of America's greatest preachers, is a testament of hope. Collectively, they rise to the spiritual challenge of our time. All profits from the sale of this book are being contributed to charities benefiting the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Contributors: Daniel W.

His remarkable short stories have led both the New Yorker and Harpers to single him out as one of the most original and admired voices in a generation. These stories are abundant proof of Rick Moody's grace as a stylist and a shaper of interior lives. He writes with equal force about the blithe energies of youth (\"Boys\") and the rueful onset of middle age (\"Hawaiian Night\"), about Midwestern optimists (\"Double Zero\") and West coast strategists (\"Baggage Carousel\"), about visionary exhilaration (\"Forecast from the Retail Desk\") and delusional catharsis (\"Surplus Value Books: Catalog Number 13.\")  The astounding title story, which has already been reprinted in four different anthologies, is a masterpiece of remembrance and thwarted love.Full of deep feeling and stunningly beautiful language, the stories in Demonology offer the deepest pleasures that fiction can afford.",

Having fled the F'dor - an ancient, powerful evil - the three emerged on the other side of the world, only to discover that fourteen centuries had passed. Their homeland had been destroyed, their people scattered across several continents, and everyone they had ever known had long since passed...except, perhaps, the F'dor.Prophecy continued this epic. Driven by a vision, Rhapsody rescued the religious leader of her new homeland while Achmed and Grunthor sought evidence of the F'dor. The three learned they might be their world's only hope, heroes spoken of in the Prophecy of the Three, but time was running short. They had to find their elusive enemy before his darkness consumed them all.Destiny concludes this trilogy. Rhapsody and Achmed seek out the offspring of the F'dor, hoping to use them to hunt it down, while Grunthor prepares the Bolglands for war. But as they near the completion of their quest, their world crosses the threshold of disaster and faces utter oblivion. With Destiny, Haydon brings the action to a fever pitch, achieving a crescendo of tragedy, love, and triumph of their human spirit over world-shattering cataclysm.",

The year that followed was one of the most fascinating and tumultuous in modern American history. After stunning early success with the Contract with America, the Republicans began to lose momentum; by year's end Gingrich was isolated and uncertain, and his closest allies were telling him to shut up.  Here is an unprecedented, fly-on-the-wall look at the successes, sellouts, and perhaps fatal mistakes of Newt Gingrich's Republican Revolution. Based on the award-winning Washington Post series that documented the Republicans' day-to-day attempts to revolutionize the American government, \"Tell Newt to Shut Up!\" gets to the heart of the political process.",

Porter Shreve brings a deft touch to the moments that mark a young person's entrance into the world, and a sharp eye to the ways in which the lead story can be wonderfully, seductively misleading.",
