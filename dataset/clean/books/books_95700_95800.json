        "Authors": "By Scottoline, Lisa",
        "Description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of Think Twice and Look Again comes an emotionally powerful novel about a split-second choice, agonizing consequences, and the need for justice Rose McKenna volunteers as a lunch mom in her daughter Melly\u2019s school in order to keep an eye on Amanda, a mean girl who\u2019s been bullying her daughter. Her fears come true when the bullying begins, sending Melly to the bathroom in tears. Just as Rose is about to follow after her daughter, a massive explosion goes off in the kitchen, sending the room into chaos. Rose finds herself faced with the horrifying decision of whether or not to run to the bathroom to rescue her daughter or usher Amanda to safety. She believes she has accomplished both, only to discover that Amanda, for an unknown reason, ran back into the school once out of Rose's sight. In an instance, Rose goes from hero to villain as the small community blames Amanda\u2019s injuries on her. In the days that follow, Rose's life starts to fall to pieces, Amanda\u2019s mother decides to sue, her marriage is put to the test, and worse, when her daughter returns to school, the bullying only intensifies. Rose must take matters into her own hands and get down to the truth of what really happened that fateful day in order to save herself, her marriage and her family. In the way that Look Again had readers questioning everything they thought they knew about family, Save Me will have readers wondering just how far they would go to save the ones they love. Lisa Scottoline is writing about real issues that resonate with real women, and the results are emotional, heartbreaking and honest.",

        "Title": "Shopping for Identity: The Marketing of Ethnicity",
        "Authors": "By Halter, Marilyn",
        "Description": "In America today, you can connect to your ethnic heritage in dozens of ways, or adopt an identity just for an evening. Our society is not a melting pot but a salad bar--a bazaar in which the purveyors of goods and services spend close to $2 billion a year marketing the foods, clothing, objects, vacations, and events that help people express their (and others') ethnic identities. This is a huge business, whose target groups are the \"hyphenated Americans\"--in other words, all of us.As immigrant groups gain economic security, they tend to reinforce--not relinquish--their ethnic identification. Marilyn Halter demonstrates that, to a great extent, they do it by shopping. And their purchasing power is enormous. How has the marketplace responded to this hunger? Instantly and wholeheartedly: tweaking old products and inventing new ones; launching new brands in supermarkets, new music groups, vacation itineraries, language courses, toys, greeting cards, et cetera. This nexus of business and ethnicity is already seen as the hottest consumer development of this decade, and Halter is uniquely qualified to describe its origins, the exponential growth of products and advertising, and the phenomenal sales of items from salsa to Chieftains CDs.She addresses her subject with an abundance of anecdotal evidence, telling examples of ethnic marketing, and interviews with entrepreneurs (many of them immigrants) who are vigorously seizing the opportunities offered by the business of ethnicity.Shopping for Identity is provocative, intriguing, and farseeing, illuminating an important aspect of our contemporary way of life while validating the yearning we all feel for connection to our roots.",

After narrowly escaping jail for swiping a woman's handbag from a sleazy motel, the hapless Wes is on trial for murder: His uncle has been bludgeoned to death, and the weapon is covered in Wes's fingerprints. Wes's explanations about a frame-up, a villainous gang, and a mysterious sexpot only enrage his already mortified family. But Sidney Gargoyle Grant, a disreputable young lawyer, is irritated by the rush to condemnation, and resolves to untangle the truth.",

It's hard to call a book little, however, when it becomes so thick and chock-full of info that it takes two people to lift it\u2014which is exactly what would have happened if author Robin Williams had tried to fit a detailed discussion of Apple's powerful OS X iApps into her latest edition of The Little Mac Book\u2014called Robin Williams Mac OS X Book, Jaguar Edition. Thus was born this handy companion volume: The Little Mac iApps Book.The Little Mac iApps Book provides detailed coverage of each powerful iApp that Mac OS X installs on your computer: Mail, iCal, iChat, Rendezvous, iPhoto, iTunes, iMovie, Preview, and iDVD. Through tips, techniques, and tutorials, best-selling authors John Tollett and Robin Williams teach not just how to use the individual iApps, but how to use them together and interactively. The book also discusses the benefits of setting up a .Mac account\u2014all in the friendly, funny, unintimidating style you've come to expect from this popular series.

        "Description": "How much is enough? Having money is becoming increasingly more important in our society.  When questioned, many Americans answered that being financially well-off was more important than raising a family and helping others.  And this is not a phenomenon that is occurring only on the outside of the Church.  Christians are finding themselves lured into the financial freedom trap, as well.Join Ray Linder as he takes a look at what God says about money and our use of it.  See how changing your attitude about what you have is what truly sets you free.  Gain a new perspective on your finances and reduce financial worry with these seven truths:  1. Financial freedom is an attitude, not an amount.  2. Give God you heart, not your money.  3. Spend wisely your money, whatever the amount.  4. Take steps to reduce and control debt.  5. Invest by the book, not by your emotions.  6. Good stewards consider relationships in their decision-making.  7. Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Don't wait any longer.  Now is the time to banish financial worry forever.",

So says Michael Graham&#8212radio talk show host, former GOP campaign consultant, and journalist&#8212in his new book, That\u2019s No Angry Mob, That\u2019s My Mom. That\u2019s No Angry Mob, That\u2019s My Mom taps into the frustration and anxiety felt by hundreds of thousands of taxpayers at Tea Parties nationwide. Frustration that the government is taking over our lives; punishing success while rewarding failure; and fostering a society of Americans who don\u2019t take responsibility for their actions and then expect the government&#8212and their fellow citizens&#8212to pick up the bill. Graham, known for his searing wit and controversial comments, also explains who the tea party &#147;activists\u201d really are: ordinary, everyday citizens pushed into action by the threat of higher taxes and increased government intrusion. Tackling everything from the economy and education to health care and the housing market, Graham argues that it\u2019s up to us to take control back from the government bureaucrats and to restore the home-spun values of hard work, fair play, and individual responsibility. That\u2019s No Angry Mob, That\u2019s My Mom shows us how.",

In the long view, history is seen as a series of events\u2014but the course of those events is determined by individuals and their actions. During the next ten years, individual leaders will face significant transitions for their nations: the United States\u2019 relationships with Iran and Israel will be undergoing changes, China will likely confront a major crisis, and the wars in the Islamic world will subside. Unexpected energy and technology developments will emerge, and labor shortages will begin to matter more than financial crises. Distinguished geopolitical forecaster George Friedman analyzes these events from the perspectives of the men and women leading these global changes, focusing in particular on the American president, who will require extraordinary skills to shepherd the United States through this transitional period. The Next Decade is a provocative and fascinating look at the conflicts and opportunities that lie ahead.",

Twenty-five years earlier, a gruesome murder rocked the unforgiving streets of Four Corners. Now, sud\u00addenly, a dying Chicago paper is running a serial expos\u00e9 on new evidence in that old case, threatening to implicate Bobby and his older brother, Ruben\u2014a decorated, high-ranking detective and cop- prince of the streets. The smear campaign stirs up decades-old bad blood, leading the Vargas brothers down an increasingly twisted and terrifying path, where the sins of the past threaten to destroy what remains of the truth. As readers and critics discovered in his first novel, Calumet City, Charlie Newton\u2019s Chicago is a landscape as brutal and poignant as any in modern crime fiction\u2014a multi-faceted, shockingly violent labyrinth of gangland politics, political backstabbing, corporate malfeasance, and, possi\u00adbly, hope.

McClanahan and donated to the Apache Software Foundation's Jakarta project in 2000, has become one of the most popular presentation frameworks for building web applications with Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology.  It encourages application architecture based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm, colloquially known as the Model 2 approach.As popular as Struts is becoming, the online documentation is inadequate, focusing on the most basic functionality and leaving out information crucial to developers writing today's complex web applications.  O'Reilly's Programming Jakarta Struts was written by Chuck Cavaness after his internet company decided to adopt the framework, then spent months really figuring out how to use it to its fullest potential.  He calls the books, \"the culmination of lessons learned (the hard way) during the building of our application.\"Readers will benefit from the real-world, \"this is how to do it\" approach Cavaness takes to developing complex enterprise applications using Struts, and his focus on the 1.1 version of the Framework makes this the most up-to-date book available.Programming Jakarta Struts covers:An overview of the concepts involved in writing web applicationsDetailed installation and configuration instructions to get Struts up and running quicklyA thorough discussion of how Struts implements the Model-View-Controller pattern, and how to interface with that pattern in your own applicationsJSP and Jakarta Tag Libraries for authoring complex web pagesLogging, Validation, and Exception Handling with StrutsUsing the new Struts template framework, Tiles.Writing internationalization and localization code using StrutsPractical, real-world best practices for web applicationsCraig McClanahan, originator of Struts, says of the book, \"One thing a lot of open source packages lack is a comprehensive guide to all of the features -- something that goes far enough past \"hello, world\" to get you into solving real application design problems, and it looks like you've hit just the right level for a lot of people.\"",

        "Description": "Graphics programmers aren't the only ones who need to be proficient with graphics. Web and applications programmers know that a dull web page can be quickly transformed into one that's interesting and lively with the use of well-planned graphics. And fortunately, you don't need the skills of a fulltime graphics programmer to use graphics effectively. From access counters and log report graphs to scientific plots and on-the-fly animated GIFs, graphics scripting is within the grasp of most web programmers.  Using open source software, like Perl, you have the power to dynamically generate graphics based on user input and activity, easily manipulate graphics content, and optimize graphics for compression and quality.Geared toward Perl users and webmasters, Perl Graphics Programming focuses on open-source scripting programs that manipulate graphics files for use on the Web.  The book demystifies the manipulation of graphics formats for newcomers to the Web with a practical, resource-like approach.  With this book you'll learn to:Generate dynamic web graphics with charts, tables, and buttonsAutomate graphics tasks (thumbnails and borders)Create dynamics web documents (PDF, Postscript)Produce rich Internet experiences with Flash and SVGYou'll begin with a tour of the most common web graphic file formats--PNG, JPEG, GIF, SWF, SVG, Postscript and PDF--then you'll explore the most powerful tools and Perl modules available for manipulating these graphics, such as GD, PerlMagick, and GIMP. Included in this part of the book is a thorough description of the Ming module for creating on-the-fly Flash files. Next, a \"cookbook\" section includes practical, all purpose recipes: GIF animation, generating images within a dynamic application, communicating between SWF front-end and Perl back-end, XSLT transformations, compression, and much more.Perl programmers naturally turn to Perl to tackle whatever challenge they have at hand, and graphics programming is no exception.  Perl Graphics Programming provides all the tools you need to begin programming and designing graphics for the Web immediately. This book will change how you think about generating and manipulating graphics for the Web.",
