        "Description": "So you don't have an expansive yard in the country for your dream garden. Maybe you don't have a yard at all. No matter. Any area is a potential garden. Your balcony, dooryard space, curbside turf, or window box can still be transformed into a welcome, lush space for planting. Author Kerwin Fischer, a veteran of packing plants into every available nook and cranny, offers his strategies for getting every petal of color out of your spot of earth throughout the growing season. With Green Places in Small Spaces, Fischer gets vicarious gardeners into the soil as he explains small-space gardening from the emergence of spring bulbs to fall cleanup. This gardener of wit and discernment offers advice on choosing a garden site, planting in shady or sunny areas, and selecting compact or dwarf plants, and gives tricks for growing several plants in the same area. Along with a dose of easy-to-understand gardening basics, Green Places in Small Spaces includes help on designing traditional and container gardens, finding a garden style that suits you, choosing the tools you really need, and combating urban problems like vandalism. Full-color photographs and drawings bring the planning and planting to life.",

        "Description": "A classic tale gets a Jewish twist, when Little Red Hen asks her friends for help making Passover matzah.\u00a0  Before she knows it, Little Red Hen tells herself, it will be time for Passover. So she decides to plant some grain.\u00a0 But when she asks her friends to help, they're too busy for her.\u00a0 \"Sorry, bub,\" says the Horse.\u00a0 \"Think again,\" barks the dog.\u00a0 Oy gevalt!\u00a0 \"Friends, shmends,\" she says.\u00a0 \"I'll just do it myself.\" But when the wheat is grown and harvested, when the flour is milled and the matzah baked and the Seder table set-- all by Red on her own--who should come to her door but her not-so-helpful friends?\u00a0 Though she's tempted to turn them away, Little Red is a mensch-- and a mensch forgives. Like her Haggadah says: Let all who are hungry come and eat.\u00a0 But who will do all these dishes? Filled with Yiddish phrases and a healthy dose of humor, this Passover tale of hard work, friendship, and forgiveness is not to be missed.\u00a0 Bright cartoon illustrations add humor and detail to the story.\u00a0 Backmatter includes a glossary of Yiddish phrases, an author's note about the holiday, and a recipe for making your own Passover matzah.",

        "Title": "Once Upon A Number: A Mathematician Bridges Stories And Statistics",
        "Authors": "By Paulos, John Allen",
        "Description": "What two things could be more different than numbers and stories? Numbers are abstract, certain, and eternal, but to most of us somewhat dry and bloodless. Good stories are full of life: they engage our emotions and have subtlety and nuance, but they lack rigor and the truths they tell are elusive and subject to debate. As ways of understanding the world around us, numbers and stories seem almost completely incompatible.Once Upon a Number shows that stories and numbers aren\u2019t as different as you might imagine, and in fact they have surprising and fascinating connections. The concepts of logic and probability both grew out of intuitive ideas about how certain situations would play out. Now, logicians are inventing ways to deal with real world situations by mathematical means\u2014by acknowledging, for instance, that items that are mathematically interchangeable may not be interchangeable in a story. And complexity theory looks at both number strings and narrative strings in remarkably similar terms.Throughout, renowned author John Paulos mixes numbers and narratives in his own delightful style. Along with lucid accounts of cutting-edge information theory we get hilarious anecdotes and jokes; instructions for running a truly impressive pyramid scam; a freewheeling conversation between Groucho Marx and Bertrand Russell (while they\u2019re stuck in an elevator together); explanations of why the statistical evidence against OJ Simpson was overwhelming beyond doubt and how the Unabomber\u2019s thinking shows signs of mathematical training; and dozens of other treats. This is another winner from America\u2019s favorite mathematician.",

        "Description": "A guide to the parallel revolutions in technology, organizations, and leadership, this practical yet thought-provoking book presents a wealth of evidence to show that the two recurrent themes of democracy and enterprise are transforming our institutions. Organizations are becoming changing clusters of entrepreneurial units working together to form \"internal markets,\" while this diversity is being integrated into a \"corporate community\" that unites the interests of investors, workers, clients, business partners, and the public. Even fierce competitors are cooperating. o \"Serving enterprises\" make customers working partners in the creation of value o \"Knowledge entrepreneurs\" form teams of self-managed internal enterprises o \"Internal markets\" and \"Corporate community\" harness external forces to drive continuous change o The power of \"inner leadership\" unites liberated workers, critical clients, and temporary business partners o \"Intelligent growth\" offers strategic advantage that is ecologically benign Illustrative examples, survey data, trends, anecdotes, and exercises offer original insights into the use of New Management principles. In addition, mini-case studies of MCI, Saturn, The Body Shop, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson, Southwest Airlines, Home Depot, IKEA, Wal-Mart and other great companies illustrate vividly how creative managers design and lead organizations in an era of global competition, constant change, and empowered people. The author also analyzes critical issues, such as the nagging old conflict between profit and society, to provide managers a comprehensive, stimulating guide to where their craft is heading. Halal argues that the transition to a New Management is almost inevitable because it is being driven not by altruism or even good leadership, but by the relentless advance of the Information Revolution. Only small entrepreneurial teams operating from the bottom-up can master today&apos;s exploding complexity, and gaining stakeholder support is now essential because a knowledge-based economy has made cooperation a competitive advantage. Rather than fussing over quick fixes, The New Management points the way toward more fundamental solutions to the massive changes that will confront all institutions as the transition to a knowledge society rolls on into the 21st century.",

        "Description": "John Brady Kiesling, a twenty-year veteran of the foreign service, publicly resigned his position as political counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Athens in February 2003 to protest the Bush administration\u2019s impending invasion of Iraq. He believed that the security, economic, and moral costs of this war, including the blackening of America\u2019s image abroad, would far outweigh any benefit to the American people. In Diplomacy Lessons, Kiesling reminds readers that U.S. power does not rest on military might alone and that anger at America has real consequences for U.S. national interests.The security and prosperity of the American people depend on efficient cooperation with foreigners on a range of issues, not only terrorism and nuclear nonproliferation but also trade policy, environmental protection, and even public health. The policy decisions of America\u2019s foreign partners are driven by domestic politics, just as they are in the United States, and effective U.S. diplomacy requires understanding these political realities. An unloved superpower faces significant costs, both economic and strategic, in the pursuit of its interests. Kiesling calls for a return to realist policy making that recognizes the limits of U.S. power and uses thoughtful diplomacy to legitimize our security requirements in the eyes of our international partners.This book is, at heart, an argument for how to best achieve America\u2019s goals abroad. Kiesling\u2019s passionate critique of current U.S. foreign policy and his prescriptions for restoring American influence and legitimacy will interest anyone concerned about the future of U.S. and world affairs.",

        "Description": "A debut essay collection by one of the best new nature writers\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I stopped being surprised by nature in New York City, which is, after all, simply a name we\u2019ve given this landscape\u2014a label meaningless to the birds, the turtles, the river.\u201dAs a child in suburban Maryland, Lisa Couturier spent all her time outdoors, playing with snakes and toads and exploring every inch of what nature offered. Her parents were convinced that she would head out West as an adult, in search of wild lands and animals. Instead, Couturier moved to New York City, and it was there that she began to see nature and all the creatures in it with new eyes.In The Hopes of Snakes, Couturier brings together the best of her essays on urban and suburban nature throughout the Northeast, from Washington, D.C., to Boston. She writes of the things in nature that we typically love, like the power and beauty of the Potomac River or the majesty of a peregrine falcon soaring above a skyscraper, but she also celebrates the animals we either ignore or consider pests, such as geese, snakes, and crows. Nature is often invisible to people amidst the concrete and glass of dense urban life. But Couturier\u2019s sharp eye and deep humanity have found what is so remarkable in city nature and illuminated it for readers like no one before her.The Hopes of Snakes is an eloquent and powerful debut by one of the best writers exploring nature in the humanized landscape today.\"Lisa Couturier's essays shine with her candor, her perception, and her affection for the creatures of our world, especially with their difficult encounters on our endless roads and in our inhospitable towns and cities. Whether the subject is a snake or a falcon or a crow named Edgar, these essays will both enlighten and give much reading pleasure.\" \u2014Mary Oliver\"Lisa Courturier has crafted a collection of essays that is, quite simply, stunning. The Hopes of Snakes takes readers into the lives and hearts of city creatures---those animals who persist in spite of us, and who call us back to our wild souls again and again from the dustiest of ledges, the dirtiest of cracks, the murkiest of city waterways. With respect and deep sensitivity, Courturier has crafted out of her life stories a guidebook back to those relational roots that sustain us through the most paved-over aspects of human life. I loved this book---loved getting to know each pigeon, each turtle, each falcon along with a colorful human cast of characters wise enough to treat these creatures as relatives. This book is a keeper, a teacher.\" \u2014Susan Chernak McElroy, author of Animals as Teachers and Healers \"The Hopes of Snakes is a book full of rapture, mystery and surprise. I LOVE this book. Snakes DO have hopes, Lisa Couturier tells us, and that's just the first of her revelatory observations, many of which will take your breath away as surely as the glimpse of an owl in the city, or the voice of coyote in the backyard. Let this lyrical, extraordinary book lure you into the urban thickets and vales of foxes, vultures, coyotes, serpents and geese--and inspire you to recapture the wild heart that keeps us truly alive.\" \u2014Sy Montgomery, author of Search for the Golden Moon Bear \u201cIn this brilliant new book, Lisa Couturier offers readers a resonant and uplifting meditation upon the natural landscape. The author and her publisher are to be congratulated for producing a book that belongs in any library, public or private, that aspires to be complete on the subject of nature writing. In her mastery of the essay as an expressive form, and in the power and sincerity of her thinking, Lisa Couturier has established herself as the literary equal of such contemporary luminaries as Linda Hogan, Diane Ackerman and Barbara Kingsolver.\u201d \u2014John A. Murray, editor of the American Nature Writing series",
