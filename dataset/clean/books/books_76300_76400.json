        "Title": "The End of the Nation State: The Rise of Regional Economies",
        "Authors": "By Ohmae, Kenichi",
        "Description": "Nation states, asserts the world-renowned business strategist Kenichi Ohmae, are dinosaurs waiting to die. In this profoundly important book Ohmae argues that not only have nation states lost their ability to control exchange rates and protect their currencies, but they no longer generate real economic activity. As a result, he maintains, they have already forfeited their role as critical participants in the global economy. Once efficient engines of wealth creation, nation states today have become inefficient engines of wealth distribution, whose fates are increasingly determined by economic choices made elsewhere.  Ohmae contends that four great forces -- capital, corporations, consumers, and communication -- have combined to usurp the economic power once held by the nation state. In the first full-scale analysis of this global phenomenon, Ohmae explains exactly how communications now control the movement of capital and corporations across national borders, how demanding consumers determine the flow of goods and services, and how harmful government policies are increasingly disciplined by the actions of informed consumers, profit-seeking corporations, and currency markets.  Old habits die hard and the habits of power die hardest of all. While governments cling to jingoistic celebrations of nationhood that place far more value on emotion-grabbing symbols than on the welfare of their citizens, Ohmae reveals that within their borders a revolution has been born. He documents how affluent economic zones forming natural \"business units\" have arisen throughout the world, bringing real, concrete improvements in the quality of life. These new engines of prosperity, which Ohmae calls region states, have emerged, for example, between San Diego and Tijuana, Singapore and parts of Malaysia and Indonesia, Silicon Valley and the Bay Area, and Hong Kong and the adjacent portion of the Chinese mainland. He describes how these region states, each inhabited by 5 to 20 million people, have closer links to other region states in the global economy than to their \"host\" nations, and constitute essential growing markets for the goods and services of global corporations.  Ohmae concludes that the emergence of the region state changes deeply and forever the global logic that defines how corporations operate and how the governments of nation states understand their proper role in economic affairs. Managers and policymakers must remember that people came first, and borders came afterwards. This masterful analysis will redefine the workings of the global economy for generations to come.",

But when Camille is hit by a   truck and killed, CeeCee is left to fend for herself. To the rescue comes her previously unknown great-aunt, Tootie   Caldwell.In her vintage Packard convertible, Tootie whisks CeeCee away to Savannah's perfumed world   of prosperity and Southern eccentricity, a world that seems to be run entirely by women.

        "Description": "It was a summer morning in 1982 when soldiers ravaged the village of Chupan Ya, raping and killing women and children. Twenty-three victims are said to lie in the well where, twenty years later, Dr. Temperance Brennan and a team from the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation now dig. No records were kept. To their families, the dead are \"the disappeared.\"  Forensic anthropologist for the medical examiners in North Carolina and Montreal, Tempe is in Guatemala for a month's service to help some families identify and bury their dead. She digs in a cold, damp pit where she finds a hair clip, a fragment of cloth, a tiny sneaker. Her trowel touches something hard: the hip of a child no more than two years old. It's heartbreaking work. Something savage happened here twenty years ago. The violence continues today. The team is packing up for the day when an urgent satellite call comes in. Two colleagues are under attack. Shots ring out, and Tempe listens in horror to a woman's screams. Then there is silence. Dead silence.  With this new violence, everything changes, both for the team and for Tempe, who's asked by the Guatemalan police for her expertise on another case. Four privileged young women have vanished from Guatemala City in recent months. One is the Canadian ambassador's daughter. Some remains have turned up in a septic tank, and Tempe unfortunately knows septic tanks. Teaming with Special Crimes Investigator Bartolom\u00e9 Galiano, and with Montreal detective Andrew Ryan, who may have more than just professional reasons to join her on the case, Tempe soon finds herself in a dangerous web that stretches far beyond Guatemala's borders. The stakes are huge. As power, money, greed, and science converge, Tempe must make life-altering choices.  From cutting-edge science in the lab, where Tempe studies fetal bones and cat hair DNA, to a chilling en-counter in a lonely morgue, Grave Secrets is powerful, page-turning entertainment from a crime fiction superstar who combines riveting authenticity with witty, elegant prose.",

        "Description": "In this new book, word maven Hugh Rawson brings you a marvelously entertaining roundup of 1,000 spurious etymologies, then enlightens you with their genuine counterparts.Some wiseacre (which, by the way, has nothing to do with land measure) may have told you that a tip is something you give a waiter \"to insure promptness,\" or that James I once knighted a remarkable side of beef, saying, \"Arise, Sir Loin,\" but like hundreds of oft-repeated accounts of word origins, they're just too good to be true. People, it seems, are etymologizing creatures, and if a certain lexical lineage is unclear, they are sure to invent one.If you hear that pumpernickel was named by Napoleon Bonaparte, who, upon being served the dark German bread, derided it as \"pain pour Nicol\" (bread for his horse, Nicol), you can take it with a grain of salt (which since 1647 has been making questionable tales, like questionable meat, more palatable).With his third book, Hugh Rawson pulls off the literary equivalent of a hat trick (which is original not to ice hockey, it turns out, but to cricket).",

He leaves a message asking six specific people, all of whom attended Huntington House, to be his pallbearers, and Shane is one of the chosen. He and his fellow pallbearers don\u2019t believe it was a suicide. That leaves murder. But why, and by whom? Together, the pallbearers embark on a dangerous odyssey in pursuit of justice for Pop, and for retribution against those responsible for his death.

All the characters are real and were alive during the great manhunt of April 1865.  Their words are authentic and come from original sources: letters, manuscripts, trial transcripts, newspapers, government reports, pamphlets, books and other documents.  What happened in Washington, D.C., that spring, and in the swamps and rivers, forests and fields of Maryland and Virginia during the next twelve days, is far too incredible to have been made up.\"  So begins this fast-paced thriller that tells the story of the pursuit and capture of John Wilkes Booth and gives a day-by-day account of the wild chase to find this killer and his accomplices. Based on James Swanson's bestselling adult book MANHUNT: THE 12-DAY CHASE FOR LINCOLN'S KILLER, this young people's version is an accessible look at the assassination of a president, and shows readers Abraham Lincoln the man, the father, the husband, the friend, and how his death impacted those closest to him.",

Demonstrating that mutualism will require a dramatic change in the way states, international institutions, corporations, and local communities interact, De Santis argues that this transformation will be especially difficult for the United States, which will have to abandon its exceptionalist identity and rejoin a world it can no longer escape.",

        "Description": "Depicting the fatal clash between material desires and the liberating power of human passions, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's Eug\u00e9nie Grandet is translated with an introduction by M.A. Crawford in Penguin Classics.  In a gloomy house in provincial Saumur, the miser Grandet lives with his wife and daughter, Eug\u00e9nie, whose lives are stifled and overshadowed by his obsession with gold. Guarding his piles of glittering treasures and his only child equally closely, he will let no one near them. But when the arrival of her handsome cousin, Charles, awakens Eug\u00e9nie's own desires, her passion brings her into a violent collision with her father that results in tragedy for all. Eug\u00e9nie Grandet is one of the earliest and finest works in Balzac's Com\u00e9die humaine cycle, which portrays a society consumed by the struggle to amass wealth and achieve power. Here Grandet embodies both the passionate pursuit of money, and the human cost of avarice.  M. A. Crawford's lucid translation is accompanied by an introduction discussing the irony and psychological insight of Balzac's characterization, the role of fate in the novel, its setting and historical background. \u00a0For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",

        "Title": "Pleasures of the Porch : Ideas for Gracious Outdoor Living",
        "Authors": "By Bowman, Daria Price and Lamarca, Maureen",
        "Description": "For every type of house and for every family's style, there is a perfect porch. Whether you want a quiet outdoor niche where family members can lounge with a good summer read, or a casual front porch that encourages passing neighbors to stop and chat, over the years porch styles have developed that foster these very activities.This beautifully photographed volume details the porch's illustrious past, from its origins as the portico, or covered entryway, of ancient Greece to its glory days as the elaborate outdoor sitting room of Victorian times. A discussion of different types of porches follows, with notes on the particular character of each.Suggestions for creating an area for solitude and respite as well as ideas for converting the space into an elegant room for a party include tips on planning for alfresco meals, decorating for festive occasions, and providing the essentials for relaxation.Pleasures of the Porch also introduces you to the furnishings and accesories of this most romantic of rooms. Bentwood rockers and white wicker settees, string hammocks and wide-striped awnings, floral-washed pillows and heavy Mexican glassware--these are the things that provide comfort and luxury, making the porch a favorite retreat. These chapters reveal which pieces are appropriately sturdy and weather resistant, as well as which are best suited to the ambience of the porch.Because the beauty of nature is often what draws us to the porch, Pleasures of the Porch devotes a special chapter to potted flowers, window boxes, and other plantings that bring color, scent, and pattern to the porch and surrounding areas.Filled with vibrant color photographs that capture the enchantment of porch living, this extravagant volume presents hundreds of ways to truly take pleasure in porches.For every type of house and for every family's style, there is a perfect porch.
