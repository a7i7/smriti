        "Title": "The Pecking Order: Which Siblings Succeed and Why",
        "Authors": "By Conley, Dalton",
        "Description": "We want to think of the family as a haven, a sheltered port from the maelstrom of social forces that rip through our lives. Within the family, we like to think, everyone starts out on equal footing. And yet we see around us evidence that siblings all too often diverge widely in social status, wealth, and education. We think these are aberrant cases\u2014the president and the drug addict, the professor and the convict. Surely in most families, in our families, all children will succeed equally, and when they don\u2019t, we turn to one-dimensional answers to explain the discrepancy\u2014birth order, for instance, or gender. In this groundbreaking book, Dalton Conley shows us that inequality in families is not the exception but the norm. More than half of all income inequality in this country occurs not between families but within families. Children who grow up in the same house can\u2014and frequently do\u2014wind up on opposite sides of the class divide. In fact, the family itself is where much inequality is fostered and developed. In each family, there exists a pecking order among siblings, a status hierarchy. This pecking order is not necessarily determined by the natural abilities of each individual, and not even by the intentions or will of the parents. It is determined by the larger social forces that envelop the family: gender expectations, the economic cost of education, divorce, early loss of a parent, geographic mobility, religious and sexual orientation, trauma, and even arbitrary factors such as luck and accidents. Conley explores each of these topics, giving us a richly nuanced understanding that transforms the way we should look at the family as an institution of care, support, and comfort. Drawing from the U.S. Census, from the General Social Survey conducted by the University of Chicago over the last thirty years, and from a landmark study that was launched in 1968 by the University of Michigan and that has been following five thousand families, Conley has irrefutable empirical evidence backing up his assertions. Enriched by countless anecdotes and stories garnered through years of interviews, this is a book that will forever alter our idea of family.",

Mohammed has a strong network of agents and sympathizers throughout Europe and the Middle East, and the Colombian has an equally strong drug network throughout America. What if they were to form an alliance, to combine all their assets and connections? The potential for profits would be enormous\u2014and the potential for destruction unimaginable.In the Brave New World of terrorism\u2014where anybody with a spare AK-47, a knowledge of kitchen chemistry, or simply the will to die can become a player\u2014the old rules no longer apply. No matter what new governmental organizations come into being, the only truly effective ones are those that are quick and agile, free of oversight and restrictions...and outside the system.Way outside the system.In a nondescript office building in suburban Maryland, the firm Hendley Associates does a profitable business in stocks, bonds, and international currencies, but its true mission is quite different: to identify and locate terrorist threats, and then deal with them, in whatever manner necessary. Established with the knowledge of President John Patrick Ryan, \"the Campus\" is always on the lookout for promising new talent, its recruiters scattered throughout the armed forces and government agencies\u2014and three men are about to cross its radar.The first is Dominic Caruso, a rookie FBI agent, barely a year out of Quantico, whose decisive actions resolve a particularly brutal kidnap/murder case. The second is Caruso's brother, Brian, a Marine captain just back from his first combat action in Afghanistan, and already a man to watch. And the third is their cousin...a young man named Jack Ryan, Jr.Jack was raised on intrigue. As his father moved through the ranks of the CIA and then into the White House, Jack received a life course in the world and the way it operates from agents, statesmen, analysts, Secret Service men, and black ops specialists such as John Clark and Ding Chavez. He wants to put it all to work now\u2014but when he knocks on the front door of \"the Campus,\" he finds that nothing has prepared him for what he is about to encounter. For it is indeed a different world out there, and in here...and it is about to become far more dangerous.",

Adam Banting, a somewhat aimless young scholar at Cambridge University, is called to his professor's office one afternoon and assigned a special summer project: to write a scholarly monograph about a famous garden built in the 1500s. Dedicated to the memory of Signor Docci's dead wife, the garden is a mysterious world of statues, grottoes, meandering rills, and classical inscriptions. But during his three-week sojourn at the villa, Adam comes to suspect that clues to a murder are buried in the strange iconography of the garden: the long-dead Signor Docci most likely killed his wife and filled her memorial garden with pointers as to both the method and the motive of his crime.  As the mystery of the garden unfolds, Adam finds himself drawn into a parallel intrigue. Through his evolving relationship with the lady of the house-the ailing, seventy-something Signora Docci-he finds clues to yet another possible murder, this one much more recent. The signora's eldest son was shot by Nazi officers on the third floor of the villa, and her husband, now dead, insisted that the area be sealed and preserved forever. Like the garden, the third-floor rooms are frozen in time. Delving into his subject, Adam begins to suspect that his summer project might be a setup. Is he really just the na?ve student, stumbling upon clues, or is Signora Docci using him to discover for herself the true meaning of the villa's murderous past?",

It is then, at the young and vulnerable age of seventeen, when Lady Anna Maria Berezowska loses both of her parents and must leave the only home she has ever known.With Empress Catherine's Russian armies streaming in to take their spoils, Anna is quickly thrust into a world of love and hate, loyalty and deceit, patriotism and treason, life and death. Even kind Aunt Stella, Anna's new guardian who soon comes to personify Poland's courage and spirit, can't protect Anna from the uncertain future of the country.Anna, a child no longer, turns to love and comfort in the form of Jan, a brave patriot and architect of democracy, unaware that her beautiful and enigmatic cousin Zofia has already set her sights on the handsome young fighter. Thus Anna walks unwittingly into Zofia's jealous wrath and darkly sinister intentions.Forced to survive several tragic events, many of them orchestrated by the crafty Zofia, a strengthened Anna begins to learn to place herself in the way of destiny--for love and for country. Heeding the proud spirit of her late father, Anna becomes a major player in the fight against the countries who come to partion her beloved Poland.Push Not the River is based on the true eighteenth century diary of Anna Maria Berezowska, a Polish countess who lived through the rise and fall of the historic Third of May Constitution. Vivid, romantic, and thrillingly paced, it paints the emotional and unforgettable story of the metamorphosis of a nation--and of a proud and resilient young woman.",

Full of passion, knowledge, and an expert's considered opinions the cheese primer tells you everything you need to know about the hundreds of cheeses that have, in the last few years, become available in this country. Region-by-region, he covers all the major cheeses from France, Italy, Switzerland--the top tier of cheese-producing countries--plus the best of Britain, Ireland, Spain, the United States, Austria, Germany, and other countries. Along the way he tells how to pick out a healthy Pont l'Eveque; why to reconsider the noble Fontina for more than just cooking; how to avoid those factory-made chevres; why to seek out the sublime Vacherin Mont d'Or; and how to start exploring--Bleu de Bresse, Cabrales, Crottin de Chavignol, and so on. A complete primer, it includes information on the best ways to store and serve cheese, including which wines to serve alongside them; how to orchestrate a proper cheese course; and the unimportable cheeses to look up when abroad.",

        "Description": "Dear Sam,As your only living grandfather, I want to welcome you into this world. Always remember that ? life is a gift and a blessing. In the tradition of such bestsellers as Tuesdays with Morrie and Riding the Bus with My Sister, this emotionally powerful collection of letters from grandfather to grandson will touch readers right down to their core. Award-winning radio host, newspaper columnist, and psychologist Daniel Gottlieb has created a truly inspirational work. When his grandson was born, Daniel Gottlieb began to write a series of heartfelt letters that he hoped Sam would read later in life. He planned to cover all the important topics?dealing with your parents, handling bullies, falling in love, coping with death?and what motivated him was the fear that he might not live long enough to see Sam reach adulthood. You see, Daniel Gottlieb is a quadriplegic?the result of a near-fatal automobile accident that occurred two decades ago?and he knows enough not to take anything for granted. Then, when Sam was only fourteen months old, he was diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disability, a form of autism, and suddenly everything changed. Now the grandfather and grandson were bound by something more: a disability?and Daniel Gottlieb\u2019s special understanding of what that means became invaluable. A lovingly written, emotionally gripping book that offers unique?and universal?insights into what it means to be human. In addition to his thriving psychotherapy practice, Daniel Gottlieb serves as the host of Voices in the Family, an award-winning mental health call-in show on Philadelphia\u2019s much-respected public radio station, WHYY. He also writes a bimonthly column for the Philadelphia Inquirer entitled ?On Healing,\u201d and is the author of two books. He lectures locally and nationally on a variety of topics affecting the well-being of people, families, and the larger community.",

        "Authors": "By Freddoso, David",
        "Description": "Obama a Lefty, Not a ReformerThe first serious negative biography of Senator Barack Obama casts the Democratic nominee as a fake reformer and a real liberal. The Case Against Barack Obama by National Review's David Freddoso, blasts Obama for failing to take on the Chicago machine, for listening to \"radical advisors,\" and for backing \"doctrinaire liberal\" causes from teachers unions to abortion rights.It does not, however, compare him to Paris Hilton, or dwell at length on his religion or race - making the substance of The Case Against Barack Obama sound a bit unfamiliar amid a campaign cacophony of hyperbolic web ads, alleged race cards, and viral smears. Freddoso says John McCain's campaign and Republicans at large are making the wrong case against the Illinois senator.\"I don't think you beat Obama by saying that he's Paris Hilton,\" said Freddoso, a reporter for the conservative magazine National Review, referring to McCain's latest advertising campaign. \"The more important thing is really to look at is he who he says he is? Is he really this great reformer?\" Freddoso's book, released today by the conservative publishing house Regnery and provided exclusively to Politico by the publisher, occupies a small island in the often-shrill sea of criticism of Obama. As a range of conservatives suggest that Obama is a closet radical, and as McCain's campaign aims to disqualify him from the White House on the grounds of his international fame, Freddoso makes a case that conservatives should look at the presumptive Democratic nominee's record.His thesis: \"It's not that Obama is a bad person. It's just that he's like all the rest of them. Not a reformer. Not a Messiah. Just like all the rest of them in Washington. And just like all the other liberals too.\" Freddoso's is one of two new books harshly attacking Obama. The other, by Jerome Corsi, reportedly covers some of the same territory as the viral emails that have plagued the Democratic candidate, making much of his slender connections to Islam and his teenage drug use.Freddoso opts largely for a fact-based critique, and writes that the viral and overt smears have allowed Obama to evade substantive criticism. \"Too many of those criticizing Obama have been content merely to slander him,\" he writes. False rumors about Obama's religion and ancestry have produced, Freddoso writes, \"an intellectual laziness among the very people who should be carefully scrutinizing Obama.\"His book comes with Republican popularity at a historic low, amid widespread disenchantment with Republican ideals of limited government and hawkish foreign policy. Many - including, apparently, McCain's strategists - doubt a Republican can win a policy face-off. But as the real campaign hones in on the character of the candidates, Freddoso's book attempts to build an alternate case against Obama. Freddoso's argument begins in Chicago....Though Obama's first political steps were in Hyde Park's reformist politics, Freddoso focuses on the smooth accommodation he made to the machine....",

        "Title": "Chocolat",
        "Authors": "By Harris, Joanne",
        "Description": "When the exotic stranger Vianne Rocher arrives in the old French village of Lansquenet and opens a chocolate boutique called \u201cLa Celeste Praline\u201d directly across the square from the church, Father Reynaud identifies her as a serious danger to his flock. It is the beginning of Lent: the traditional season of self-denial. The priest says she\u2019ll be out of business by Easter.To make matters worse, Vianne does not go to church and has a penchant for superstition. Like her mother, she can read Tarot cards. But she begins to win over customers with her smiles, her intuition for everyone\u2019s favourites, and her delightful confections. Her shop provides a place, too, for secrets to be whispered, grievances aired. She begins to shake up the rigid morality of the community. Vianne\u2019s plans for an Easter Chocolate Festival divide the whole community. Can the solemnity of the Church compare with the pagan passion of a chocolate \u00e9clair?For the first time, here is a novel in which chocolate enjoys its true importance, emerging as an agent of transformation. Rich, clever, and mischievous, reminiscent of a folk tale or fable, this is a triumphant read with a memorable character at its heart.Says Harris: \u201cYou might see [Vianne] as an archetype or a mythical figure. I prefer to see her as the lone gunslinger who blows into the town, has a showdown with the man in the black hat, then moves on relentless. But on another level she is a perfectly real person with real insecurities and a very human desire for love and acceptance. Her qualities too - kindness, love, tolerance - are very human.\u201d Vianne and her young daughter Anouk, come into town on Shrove Tuesday. \u201cCarnivals make us uneasy,\u201d says Harris, \u201cbecause of what they represent: the residual memory of blood sacrifice (it is after all from the word \"carne\" that the term arises), of pagan celebration. And they represent a loss of inhibition; carnival time is a time at which almost anything is possible.\u201dThe book became an international best-seller, and was optioned to film quickly. The Oscar-nominated movie, with its star-studded cast including Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) and Judi Dench (Shakespeare in Love), was directed by Lasse Hallstrom, whose previous film The Cider House Rules (based on a John Irving novel) also looks at issues of community and moral standards, though in a less lighthearted vein.The idea for the book came from a comment her husband made one day while he was immersed in a football game on TV. \u201cIt was a throwaway comment, designed to annoy and it did. It was along the lines of...Chocolate is to women what football is to men\u2026\u201d The idea stuck, and Harris began thinking that \u201cpeople have these conflicting feelings about chocolate, and that a lot of people who have very little else in common relate to chocolate in more or less the same kind of way. It became a kind of challenge to see exactly how much of a story I could get which was uniquely centred around chocolate.\u201d Rich with metaphor and gorgeous writing...sit back and gorge yourself on Chocolat.",

        "Authors": "By Paston, Bryna Nelson",
        "Description": "Being a grandmother, writes Bryna Nelson Paston, is not one of life's free choices. \"You can pick your pet, your alma mater, and your spouse. You can decide when to have kids and how many, if you're careful. You can be a doctor, lawyer, mountain climber, or plumber. But when and where you become a grandma is your kids' decision.\"   How to Be the Perfect Grandmother is a humorous, anecdotal gift book for grandmothers, grandmothers-to-be, grandmother wannabes, anyone who has a grandmother-and, of course, grandfathers. Becoming a grandma is like getting a subpoena. You don't expect it. You don't know how to respond. You know you must be mature and accept it. Being a grandma, though, is as close as many of us ever get to perfection. There is only one little problem-the generation in the middle. \"Dealing with your child and his or her spouse while you become the most relevant person in your grandchild's life is tricky at best and downright impossible at worst.\"   From that unique point of view, Paston has written a delightful book that explains the rules for grandmothers to assure they will be an important part of their grandchildren's lives. \"We have a window of opportunity as grandparents,\" she writes, \"usually five years, or maybe more if you're lucky. So you have to make your move fast and decisively. Your kids and their spouses will intrude, interrupt, and interfere. But persevere. Circumvent them, do exactly what you want, and lie-with dignity, I might add. Whatever it takes. Promise anything, but get the kid.\"",

Malenfant decides to find out.Yet as Malenfant embarks on a grand tour of the universe, back on Earth the Japanese scientist Nemoto fears her worst nightmares are coming true.
