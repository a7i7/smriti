        "Description": "With the help of his irrepressible hero, John Francis Cuddy, Jeremiah Healy never fails to deliver scintillating, perfectly pitched mystery masterpieces in what The New York Times Book Review calls \"a superior series.\" Now the Shamus Award-winning author \"looks ready to join the honors class of private-eye writers that includes Robert B. Parker\" (USA Today), as he introduces us to The Only Good Lawyer.   An attorney friend of Boston P.l. John Cuddy has called in a favor, looking into the case of Alan Spaeth. Spaeth is one sorry piece of work -- a down-and-out divorce squeeze, a racist, a misogynist, and from all appearances, a cold-blooded killer. Frankly wishing the whole mess would disappear, Cuddy can't let it. It pains him, but he's convinced of Spaeth's innocence, and he isn't the kind of P.l. who can watch even a guy like Spaeth fry for someone else's crime.   As much as Cuddy is repulsed by the accused, he's intrigued by the victim, Woodrow Wilson Gant, the African-American lawyer who had been representing Spaeth's wife in a very nasty divorce. But before Cuddy's investigation is done, there will be plenty of nastiness to go around. On the surface, Gant led a charmed and successful life as a rising star in the glittering firmament of Massachusetts law. But three quick bullets at a deserted roadside knocked Gant out of the Boston skyline for good, and now Cuddy's discovered the attorney was also a man of strange desires and deep secrets?secrets that could prove lethal to the touch....   Ricocheting from Gant's law offices, Cuddy picks up the trail of a woman who fled the scene of the murder. Rousted by a couple of loan sharks and conned by Gant's avaricious brother, Cuddy stumbles on a more personal question. The mere mention of Gant's name puts a cold, hard kink in his relationship with Assistant D.A. Nancy Meagher, and Cuddy's Iosing sleep wondering why.   Greed. Revenge. Jealousy. There is any number of motives for murder, and Cuddy can take his pick as he investigates the high-profile homicide of Woodrow Wilson Gant, exploring the raw passion -- and touching every nerve -- of the edge.",

        "Description": "A medical expert reveals risks of the most commonly prescribed drugs-and why the drug industry doesn't want consumers to know about them.Recent scandals involving diabetes drugs, Vioxx, and many other medications reveal the serious and undisclosed risks of some of the most commonly used prescription drugs in this country. InBefore You Take That Pill, Dr. J. Douglas Bremner, a researcher and clinician at Emory University whose study on Accutane and depression made headlines, offers an inside look at the pharmaceutical industry, as well as a scientifically backed assessment of the risks of more than three hundred prescribed medications, vitamins, and supplements.While many drugs are essential to the health of consumers, as Dr. Bremner explains, for many people, the benefits may not outweigh the potential side effects. This book contains warnings that are not on the drug labels. It also exposes tricks of the trade that demonstrate how the profit-making interests of \"big pharma\" may not always be in line with the safety of the public - from the corruption that exists in the drug approval process to the tactics drug companies use to encourage doctors to prescribe their products. Most important, Before You Take That Pill empowers readers by giving them sound information on specific medications so they can understand and weigh the potential risk themselves. Backed by the latest studies, as well as insight from a doctor who is in the trenches, this book should be on the shelf of every drug consumer.",

The wife doesn\u2019t care about her husband\u2019s infidelity, but she does want to know why he\u2019s made a secret deposit\u2014at a sperm bank. What Cutter wants to know is the identity of the strange, violent man hubby is meeting in the desert\u2014a man known only as the fugitive.",

The goal of an intervention is to get the person who is addicted to alcohol, to drugs, to gambling, to sex, to what have you to seek treatment-to seek treatment today. And it is remarkably effective: over 80 percent of people faced with an intervention agree to get help. In When Enough Is Enough, Candy Finnigan offers support, advice, and hope to people who care about someone with an addiction. She acknowledges that although intervention is a powerful tool, it is a complicated process-one that absolutely must be done right.  This kind of confrontation must be highly structured, and Finnigan-a veteran of hundreds of interventions-provides a frank but sympathetic guide to preparing for and staging an intervention. By talking readers through the personal, medical, psychiatric, financial, and legal issues involved, she turns what seems like a chaotic and overwhelming task into a manageable and empowering experience.",

        "Description": "While America Aged illuminates the scope of the problem we\u2019re facing, and warns that the worst is yet to come. With the narrative flair and talent for decoding financial ambiguities that readers have come to rely on, Lowenstein brilliantly chronicles three fascinating pension cases: the collapse of the over-obligated General Motors, the pension strike that halted New York City\u2019s subways and effectively shut down the city, and the scandalous bankrupting of the affluent corner of Southern California, the city of San Diego. Not only compelling historical sagas rich with detail and unforgettable characters, each story also acts as an object lesson. Lowenstein warns that these pension wars are only the beginning of the retirement and healthcare crisis we will face if we don\u2019t find ways to address this latest moral hazard. Governments and corporations across the country used pensions as a seemingly easy way to curry favor with unions (easy because the expense would be deferred until a later generation). But now, with cumulative retirement deficits approaching $1 trillion, the day of reckoning has arrived.       Is there a way out? Lowenstein recognizes that fixing pensions will be difficult but securing retirement is a critical issue?especially in our rapidly aging country?and he proposes a cogent solution to the impending crisis. Masterfully written and convincingly argued, While America Aged is a timely and crucial wake-up call to a pension damaged America.",

        "Authors": "By Maceachern, Diane",
        "Description": "Read Diane McEachern's posts on the Penguin Blog.    Protecting our environment is one of the biggest issues facing our planet today. But how do we solve a problem that   can seem overwhelming-even hopeless? As Diane MacEachern argues in Big Green Purse, the best way to fight   the industries that pollute the planet, thereby changing the marketplace forever, is to mobilize the most powerful   consumer force in the world-women. MacEachern's message is simple but revolutionary. If women   harness the \"power of their purse\" and intentionally shift their spending money to commodities that have the greatest   environmental benefit, they can create a cleaner, greener world. Spirited and informative, this book: -   targets twenty commodities-cars, cosmetics, coffee, food, paper products, appliances, cleansers, and more-where   women's dollars can make a dramatic difference; - provides easy-to-follow guidelines and lists so women can   choose the greenest option regardless of what they're buying, along with recommended companies they should   support; - encourages women to spend wisely by explaining what's worth the premium price some green   products cost, what's not, and when they shouldn't spend money at all; and - differentiates between products   that are actually \"green\" and those that are simply marketed as \"ecofriendly.\" Whether readers want to   start with small changes or are ready to devote the majority of their budget to green products, MacEachern offers   concrete and immediate ways that women can take action and make a difference. Empowering and enlightening, Big   Green Purse will become the \"green shopping bible\" for women everywhere who are asking, \"What can I do?  \"",

Last Stories is forthcoming from Viking.\"There is no better short story writer in the English-speaking world.\"\u2014Wall Street Journal  In this collection of twelve dazzling, acutely rendered tales, William Trevor plumbs the depths of the human heart. Here we encounter a blind piano tuner whose wonderful memories of his first wife are cruelly distorted by his second; a woman in a difficult marriage who must choose between her indignant husband and her closest friend; two children, survivors of divorce, who mimic their parents' melodramas; and a heartbroken woman traveling alone in Italy who experiences an epiphany while studying a forgotten artist's Annunciation.  Trevor is, in his own words, \"a storyteller. My fiction may, now and again, illuminate aspects of the human condition, but I do not consciously set out to do so.\"Conscious or not, he touches us in ways that few writers even dare to try. Trevor\u00a0wrote eighteen novels and novellas, and hundreds of short stories, for which he has won a number of prizes including the Hawthornden Prize, the Yorkshire Post Book of the Year Award, the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and the David Cohen Literature Prize in recognition of a lifetime's literary achievement. In 2002 he was knighted for his services to literature.",

What unfolds is a passionate love story in which Dominique is torn by her destructive devotion to her first love, the seductive Rex, who periodically appears and disappears from her life, and Eric, a wealthy businessman deeply bound to her.Woven into this turbulent love story is the narrative of Dominique's intellectual life, revealing her complex relationship with art, tradition, and the cultural turmoils of our time. In portraying a character for whom love and idealism are lost, the novel hauntingly reveals the need for pursuing both.",

The Mullers had a solid marriage and two wonderful children, but over the years sex had fallen low on their to-do list. The lack of intimacy wasn?t causing them to drift apart, exactly, but their connection didn?t seem as great as it could be. Charla decided she couldn?t go on pretending the relationship they once had wasn?t important. The couple would embark on a year of scheduled sex, falling over Tonka trucks and piles of laundry in an effort to make time for each other. There were obstacles along the way (work implosions, faking it) and questions came to light. Will sex every day strengthen a marriage, or reveal the cracks? Pull a couple together or drive them apart? Does good sex (even mediocre sex) make up for things that aren?t so good?",

Printing up what she thought were the most important tips for these new graduates, Terry was surprised to find that not only were these homemade pamphlets a hit with the students, but their parents clamored for copies too.   Now with It's Ok If You're Clueless, Terry McMillan brings her trademark wit and sass to every son and daughter about to take their first tentative steps into adulthood. Offering such nuggets as \"Sit up straight,\" \"Don't listen to your parents,\" and \"Bring your laundry home,\" as well as \"See the world\" and \"Read anything and everything,\" It's Ok If You're Clueless is packed with the commonsense advice and conversational tone that have made her novels classic bestsellers.

In this book, he illustrates his customized SAFE method-the only solution that will Safeguard Assets for your Family Exclusively. Beginning with an assessment quiz that helps readers determine their particular needs, risks, and goals, along with the options available, Why Wills Won't Work addresses:  - how to protect a child's inheritance in a divorce; - the steps to take now to avoid death taxes later; - how to safeguard an inheritance for grandchildren; - how to keep probate court, creditors, and potential lawsuits from depleting an inheritance; - how to plan in advance for a disabled child or one who can't manage money; and - what documents you really need, and how to choose a lawyer.  Easy to follow and reader-friendly, with illuminating real-life stories throughout, Why Wills Won't Work is the essential guide for readers who want to be sure now that their family's future inheritance is airtight.",

And then there's old Mrs. Blairgowrie across the street, who seems unusually observant ... for a blind woman.Then Clem and his pet cockerel are found dead under mysterious circumstances, and Douglas - who has become involved with Clem's granddaughter, Susie - is one of the prime suspects.
