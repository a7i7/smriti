She has finally left her New Jersey hometown/hellhole for Columbia University in New York City; she\u2019s more into her boyfriend, Marcus Flutie, than ever (so what if he\u2019s at a Buddhist college in California?); and she\u2019s making new friends who just might qualify as stand-ins for her beloved best friend, Hope.But Jessica soon realizes that her bliss might not last. She lands an internship at a snarky Brooklyn-based magazine, but will she fit in with the \u00fcberhip staff (and will she even want to)? As she and Marcus hit the rocks, will she end up falling for her GOPunk, neoconservative RA . . . or the hot (and married!) Spanish grad student she\u2019s assisting on a summer project . . . or the oh-so-sensitive emo boy down the hall? Will she even make it through college now that her parents have cut her off financially? And what do the cryptic one-word postcards from Marcus really mean? With hilarious insight, the hyperobservant Jessica Darling struggles through her college years\u2014and the summers in between\u2014while maintaining her usual mix of wit, cynicism, and candor.",

Operation Raven had one purpose, and one purpose alone: ambush Hitler's private train, kill Hitler, and have actor Archie Smythes, whose only claim to fame was an uncanny ability to mimic Hitler, impersonate the Nazi dictator long enough to issue a single order: Stand down from Operation Sealion. But when the time came for Archie to escape from the successful ambush; Archie chose to remain behind. Thus begins the greatest impersonation imaginable, performed by an actor of modest talent and an extraordinary desire to do the right thing. At that point, the momentum of Raven truly takes off in a roller coaster ride of twists, turns, and suspense that does not stop until the shocking and surprising ending.",

        "Authors": "By Jacobs, Michael T.",
        "Description": "Break the Wall Street Rule explains how you can maximize your stock-market returns by acting as a true owner of the companies whose stock you purchase. In his thorough analysis of today's investment landscape, former Treasury Department official Michael T. Jacobs shows that this \"effective owner\" approach takes the guesswork out of investing and reinvents the relationship between corporations and shareholders. In contrast, the current Wall Street Rule - to sell stock whenever its performance displeases you - actually undermines your returns.Most investors speculate on stock prices, either buying and selling or paying mutual funds to buy and sell. Such shuffling produces dismal results compared to the overall market; each year three out of four money managers return less than the market average. The real beneficiaries of the Wall Street Rule are the investment industry and company executives who don't want to answer to owners. Jacobs shows that simply by investing for long-term growth, you can beat 95 percent of mutual funds. Even better, in the last decade companies with large effective-owner shareholders earned triple the market average.With Break the Wall Street Rule investors of any size can become effective owners. In clear language Jacobs explains how small shareholders can utilize the power of institutional investors. There are guidelines for choosing companies structured for the benefit of their shareholders, not to insulate their executives from shareholders. Other chapters describe how to assemble a portfolio and how to calculate whether a stock has paid you back enough.Many books explain when to buy stocks or which stocks to buy. Break the Wall Street Rule shows how real gains come from what you do once you own a stock. You can use the power of new SEC proxy rules to maximize your returns. You can ensure that management works for shareholders by supporting directors and resolutions that protect your interests, such as connecting pay to performance. Owning only $1000 of stock lets you propose your own shareholder resolutions; Jacobs illuminates the rules and realities of this process. As shown at Sears and GM, shareholders and boards can affect how major corporations are run. In sum, the effective owner philosophy of Break the Wall Street Rule will revolutionize the way you look at stock-market investing.",

She describes her painful isolation growing up \"different\" and her discovery of visual symbols to interpret the \"ways of the natives.\" Thinking in Pictures also gives information from the front lines of autism, including treatment, medication, and diagnosis, as well as Temple's insights into genius, savants, sensory phenomena, and animal behavior. Ultimately, it is Temple's unique ability to describe the way her visual mind works and how she first made the connection between her impairment and animal temperament that is the basis of her extraordinary gift and phenomenal success.",

The first is her husband, Warren, an aging surgeon who has lost his medical license because of his morphine addiction. The second is her son, Ben, a husband and father who struggles every day to remain sober and avoid bankruptcy.Warren has entered into an arrangement with his son that has since kept Ben financially afloat and Warren supplied with morphine. Ben's wife, Emma, desperately seeks to distance her husband from Warren before their relationship destroys her family. Opposing her efforts is Victor Javier, the mastermind of the arrangement, an immigrant whose cruelty masks a hope for his mother's deliverance. Though Linda Bascomb was once the true connection between Warren and Ben, her memory becomes the specter that polarizes them. As the pain of unresolved history accumulates, their embittered agreement collapses, and in the process destroys one life, changes another forever, and drives both from the emotional and chemical shelters in which they hide. In the inevitable reckoning, Ben and Warren are forced to acknowledge the power the dead exert on the living, the elusive nature of redemption, and the ways the things we lose define us. Sometimes shocking, always incisive, Keith Dixon's brilliant debut novel is a harsh but compassionate portrayal of love and need. Set on the emotionally bleak outskirts of New York City, Ghostfires, with stylistic power and psychological precision, lays bare a corrupt American dream-and a family with scores to settle.",

In Michelle, Washington Post writer Liza Mundy paints a revealing and intimate portrait, taking us inside the marriage of the most dynamic couple in politics today. She shows how well they complement each other: Michelle, the highly organized, sometimes intimidating, list-making pragmatist; Barack, the introspective political charmer who won't pick up his socks but shoots for the stars. Their relationship, like those of many couples with two careers and two children, has been so strained at times that he has had to persuade her to support his climb up the political ladder. And you can't blame her for occasionally regretting it: In this campaign, it is Michelle who has absorbed much of the skepticism from voters about Obama. One conservative magazine put her on the cover under the headline \"Mrs. Grievance.\"Michelle's story carries with it all the extraordinary achievements and lingering pain of America in the post-civil rights era. She grew up on the south side of Chicago, the daughter of a city worker and a stay-at-home mom in a neighborhood rocked by white flight. She was admitted to Princeton amid an angry debate about affirmative action and went on to Harvard Law School, where she was more comfortable doing pro-bono work for the poor than gunning for awards with the rest of her peers. She became a corporate lawyer, then left to train community leaders. She is modern in her tastes but likes to watch reruns of The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Brady Bunch.In this carefully reported biography, drawing upon interviews with more than one hundred people, including one with Michelle herself, Mundy captures the complexity of this remarkable woman and the remarkable life she has lived.",

Everyone knows about the Nobel Prizes, those prestigious awards that recognize the world's most talented and innovative minds. Unfortunately, not all of the hopeful thinkers and academics around the globe can become Nobel Laureates, but some are lucky enough to win the esteemed Ig Nobel Prize instead. Their unbelievable accomplishments are now documented in glorious detail in The Ig Nobel Prizes: The Annals of Improbable Research.  Drawn from the world's wackiest actual scientific research, The Ig Nobel Prizes demonstrates the extreme measures people will take in the quest for knowledge. Recent Ig Nobel honorees include:  * The professor who won the Ig Nobel Prize in Physics for a study proving that toast falls buttered side down more often.  * The Southern Baptist Church of Alabama, which won the Ig Nobel Prize in Mathematics for devising a formula to determine how many Alabamans will go to Hell.  * The Australian man who successfully patented the wheel, and the Australian Patent Office that granted it. For this act, they were jointly awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in Technology.   This hilarious book features these endeavors and many more, along with photographs from the annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremonies at Harvard University. An entertaining exhibition of brains and determination, The Ig Nobel Prizes is the ideal gift for anyone who first wants to laugh and then wants to think.",

It\u2019s a job   that makes a killing. Efficient, professional, and without apology, Lily Mansfield   is a hired assassin, working as a contract agent for the CIA. Her targets are the   powerful and corrupt, those who can\u2019t be touched by the law.  Now, after nineteen   years of service, Lily has been drawn into a dangerous game that hasn\u2019t been sanctioned,   seeking vengeance for her own reasons. Each move bolder than the next, she is compromising   her superiors, drawing unwanted attention, and endangering her very life. Though   stress and shock have made her feel somewhat invincible and a little cocky, Lily   knows that she too can be taken out in an instant. And if it\u2019s her time, so be it.   She intends to go down fighting. A CIA agent himself, Lucas Swain recognizes the   signs of trauma in the line of fire. His orders: either bring her in or bring her   down. Yet he too is drawn into the game with Lily Mansfield, dancing on a tightrope   as he tries to avoid a major international incident while still battling a tenacious   foe who is dogging their every step. Keeping laser focus on the task at hand while   vigilantly watching her back, Mansfield never sees the lethal peril that lies directly   in her path . . . and how loyalty has a price. Chock-full of the intrigue, breathless   action, and sensuality that have made Linda Howard the master of romantic suspense,   Kiss Me While I Sleep is a daring thriller of passion, sudden twists, and richly   imagined characters who live and breathe in readers\u2019 hearts. It is the most gripping   and complex novel of Linda Howard\u2019s career.",
