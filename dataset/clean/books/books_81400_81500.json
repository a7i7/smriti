First presented in London in 1700, this comedy has charmed audiences for over 300 years. This inexpensive paperbound edition, complete and unabridged, makes it widely available to today's readers.",

All manner of love stories: thwarted love stories, imaginary love  stories, love stories offhand and obsessive, philosophical love  stories, erudite and amusing love stories.\u201cPeople don't meet because they both like Burmese food,\u201d says  one character, \u201cor because someone's sister has a friend who's single  and new in town, or because Billy's nose happened to crook just slightly  to the left at an angle that made me want to weep\u2026People don't fall in  love with each other \u2026they just fall into love.\u201dEveryone does it: women of fierce independence, men of thin  character, rambling Deadheads, gay teenage girls, despondent Peace Corps  volunteers, anorexic Broadway theatre dancers, the eager, the grieving,  the uncommunicative. Even the confused do it. And they don't just fall  in love with each other\u2014they fall in love with certain moments and  familiar places, with things as ephemeral as gestures and as evanescent  as sunlight.Quirky, real, idealistic, deluded, bohemian, and true, these  are people who can\u2014and often do\u2014fall in love with a pair of ears, August  afternoons, saucers of vitamins, New Age carpenters, and dead  bumblebees. And if there's something they can teach us, it's how to  conceive of alternative worlds and the terror and the exhilaration of  venturing outside the confines of the lives we know and making our way  into a dark, glittering unknown.",

        "Title": "Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days: 365 Inspirations to Enrich Your Relationships",
        "Authors": "By Gray, John",
        "Description": "Nobody knows more about the differences between the sexes than John Gray, Ph.D. He is the man America turns to for help in deciphering the myriad complexities men and women face daily in their interactions with each other. The author of nine bestsellers--including  the history-making Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus--John Gray expands on the expert advice touched upon in his previous books and distills each message into a powerful, inspiring daily meditation in this newest volume.  There&#39;s no doubt about it: The relationship between men and women is extremely complex. We often forget just how different the sexes are, and become frustrated and confused by a loved one&#39;s behavior. Every day we need to be reminded of these differences and realize that it&#39;s okay to be different as long as we recognize and understand the behavior of the opposite sex. In Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days,  John Gray provides us with daily inspirations that lovingly and insightfully remind us of the contrasts between Mars and Venus, allowing us to solve conflicts in our relationships.  Each month is devoted to a single theme, with the daily meditations enlarging on the particular subject at hand. The topics correlate with the very traits of the month itself: January, an exhilarating time of new beginnings, inspires resolve and the desire to excel. In February, when we find ourselves deep in winter&#39;s grip and challenged by constant emotional upheaval, we seek reminders of the importance of commitment and the need for patience. May concentrates on such springtime issues as harmony and appreciation. The topics discussed are as diverse as relationships are.  Inside you&#39;ll find comforting and helpful advice on: The true meaning of equality Improving communicationGiving and receiving emotional support The awakening of our inner qualities   Needing time alone  Keeping the passion alive  Reacting to stress  Whether you need the thoughtful reminders yourself or know a friend or loved one who will benefit from these beautiful reflections, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days is a classic that no bookshelf should be without.  The Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days contains 365 inspirations to remind you each day of the basic differences between men and women  Women love a man with a plan; men love a woman with a smile.  A woman is like a wave. When she feels loved, her self-esteem rises and falls like a wave in motion. When she is feeling really good, she will reach a peak, but then suddenly her mood may change and her wave crashes down. This crash is temporary. After she reaches bottom, her mood will shift suddenly, and she will again feel good about herself. Automatically, her wave begins to rise back up...By recognizing this pattern, a man doesn&#39;t take it personally. When he doesn&#39;t feel as if he is being blamed for her downs, he can be more supportive.  A rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle, which involves getting close, pulling away, and then getting close again...Most women are surprised to realize that even when a man loves a woman, periodically he needs to pull away before he can get closer. Men instinctively feel this urge to pull away. It is not a decision or a choice. It just happens. It is neither his fault nor her fault. It is a natural cycle.  Romance for women is when a man does things without her having to ask; romance for men is when a woman appreciates the things he does.  Showing interest is one of the most important secrets to opening a woman&#39;s heart.  A man is free to be the best he can be when he feels accepted just the way he is.  Women need to work on trusting, while men need to work on caring.",

        "Authors": "By Stevenson, William and Rohmer, Richard (FRW)",
        "Description": "Intrepid's Last Case chronicles the post-World War II activities of Sir William Stephenson, whose fascinating role in helping to defeat the Nazis was the subject of the worldwide best-seller A Man Called Intrepid.  Sir William Stephenson still stood at the center of events when he and author William Stevenson discussed in the 1980s an investigation into sudden allegations that Intrepid's wartime aide, Dick Ellis, has been both a Soviet mole and a Nazi spy. They concluded that the rumors grew, ironically, from Intrepid's last wartime case involving the first major Soviet intelligence defector of the new atomic age: Igor Gouzenko. Intrepid saved Gouzenko and found him sanctuary inside a Canadian spy school, Camp X. Gouzenko was about to make more devastating disclosures than those concerning atomic espionage when the case was mysteriously terminated and Intrepid's organization dissolved.  Unraveling the implications of Gouzenko's defection and Intrepid's removal from the case, tracing the steps of Dick Ellis and disclosing much new information regarding United States and Canadian postwar intelligence activities, Intrepid's Last Case is a story that for sheer excitement rivals the best spy fiction-and is all the more important because every word is true.  Filled with never-before-revealed facts on the Soviet-Western nuclear war dance and a compelling portrayal of the mind of a professional spy, Intrepid's Last Case picks up where the first book ended, at the very roots of the cold war. It describes one of the most widespread cover-ups and bizarre betrayals in intelligence history.",

Alone at the end of a country road, with only a Great Dane for company, plagued by debts, broken machinery, and killing frosts, Kitty revives the old orchard after years of neglect. Every day is a struggle, but every day she is also rewarded by the beauty of the world and the unexpected kindness of neighbors and hired workers.Animated by quiet courage and simple goodness, The Orchard stands as a deeply moving celebration of decency and beauty in the midst of grim prospects and crushing poverty.",

        "Description": "Discover the writer inside you who only needs encouragement to turn the secret thoughts and special moments of your life into enduring words on a page.This 40-day \"workout program\" of imagination-stretching exercises will let you throw open all your inner doors, release your creativity, discover surprising connections and spark fresh ideas. By turns sober, off-the-wall, deeply emotional, thoughtful and playful, these exercises will nudge your originality into stimulating explorations. For example, you'll learn how to find something fresh and exciting about such unremarkable places as a shopping mall, a McDonald's, a bank (Day 9); write punchy first sentences for imaginary stories: mysteries, thrillers, romances, news accounts (Day 15); retell a classic fairy tale - like \"The Three Little Pigs\" - from a different viewpoint: the wolf, the wolf's psychologist, the third pig's stockbroker (Day 20); and give a voice to inanimate objects (such as a household appliance) and find out what they'd say if given the chance (Day 23).In an enjoyable, entertaining way, these 40 exercises guide you in such essential techniques as brainstorming, clustering, freewriting and revision. Whether you're a hesitant beginning writer or an experienced writer whose wellspring of wonder seems suddenly dry, this book will recharge and refresh your imagination and liberate you, through confident, effective writing, to follow wherever your dreams may lead.",

        "Description": "Strong at the Broken Places is the remarkable story of five ordinary people trapped in the complex world of serious chronic illness. In this intimate portrait, acclaimed journalist Richard M. Cohen probes lives of sickness as these individuals struggle to cope.In 2003 Cohen published Blindsided, a bestselling memoir of illness. The outpouring of support revealed to him that not only does the public want to hear from people who overcome the challenges of illness, but that in the isolated world of illness, there are people who want their voices to be heard. Strong at the Broken Places was born of the desire of many to share their stories in the hope that the sick and those who love them will see that they are not alone.Cohen spent three years chronicling the lives of five diverse \"citizens of sickness\": Denise, who suffers from ALS; Buzz, whose Christian faith helps him deal with his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Sarah, a determined young woman with Crohn's disease; Ben, a college student with muscular dystrophy; Larry, whose bipolar disorder is hidden within. The five are different in age and gender, race and economic status, but they are determined to live life on their own terms. Intimately involved with these patients' lives, Cohen formed intense relationships with each, talked to their families and friends, and shared joy, even in heart-breaking setbacks.Though each individual's illness wreaks havoc in a different way, Cohen shows how their experiences are strikingly similar and offer lessons for us all\u2014on self-determination, on courage in the face of adversity and public ignorance, on keeping hope alive, and on finding strength and peace under the most difficult of circumstances.We are strong at the broken places, stronger than we think. In sharing these inspirational and revealing stories, Richard M. Cohen and his fellow warriors against illness offer a chorus of hope.",

The authors of this book take you from basic source control of a single file, through working with multiple releases of a software project, to coordinating teams of developers on a project involving many files and more than one target platform.The authors go well beyond lists of commands and command options: they help you define the problem you're really trying to solve, and then they show you how to solve it.This book also presents TCCS, a representative \"front-end\" to RCS and SCCS that addresses problems RCS and SCCS can't handle alone, such as managing groups of files, developing for multiple platforms, and linking public and private development areas.If you're a programmer or a software project manager, this book should be required reading.",

        "Description": "When Salon.com published Faulkner Fox\u2019s article on motherhood, \u201cWhat I Learned from Losing My Mind,\u201d the response was so overwhelming that Salon reran the piece twice. The experience made Faulkner realize that she was not alone\u2014that the country is full of women who are anxious and conflicted about their roles as mothers and wives.In Dispatches from a Not-So-Perfect Life, her provocative, brutally honest, and often hilarious memoir of motherhood, Faulkner explores the causes of her unhappiness, as well as the societal and cultural forces that American mothers have to contend with. From the time of her first pregnancy, Faulkner found herself\u2014and her body\u2014scrutinized by doctors, friends, strangers, and, perhaps most of all, herself. In addition to the significant social pressures of raising the perfect child and being the perfect mom, Faulkner also found herself increasingly incensed by the unequal distribution of household labor and infuriated by the gender inequity in both her home and others\u2019. And though she loves her children and her husband passionately, is thankful for her bountiful middle-class life, and feels wracked with guilt for being unhappy, she just can\u2019t seem to experience the sense of satisfaction that she thought would come with the package. She\u2019s finally got it all\u2014the husband, the house, the kids, an interesting part-time job, even a few hours a week to write\u2014so why does she feel so conflicted?Faulkner sheds light on the fear, confusion, and isolation experienced by many new mothers, mapping the terrain of contemporary domesticity, marriage, and motherhood in a voice that is candid, irreverent, and deeply personal, while always chronicling the unparalleled joy she and other mothers take in their children.",
