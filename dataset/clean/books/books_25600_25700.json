Her father is drunk on the day of the Barnstable County Fair, so she goes by herself, and by that night her life has been transformed. When she walks into a tent to see Millroy the Magician, his eyes lighten from brown to green and fasten upon her. He performs miracles in front of Jilly's spellbound eyes and tells her he wants to eat her. He spirits her into his trailer, and for the first time in her forlorn young life, Jilly feels safe. He tells her that he has command over nine bodily functions, that he will train her to be his assistant, and that he will give her a sequined costume.But this is only the beginning. Millroy is a man like no other, a magician not simply of mere conjuring, but of true, baffling magic. He is a healer, too, a vegetarian and health fanatic with a mission to change the eating habits of his beloved United States. In search of the perfect platform, he finds it in television as an evangelical preacher, touting hygiene and the simple pure foods mentioned in the Bible. From fairground magician to cult leader, Millroy is unstoppable.In his portrait of a man who is part genius, part eccentric, and part miracle worker, and of his complete and uneasy relationship with young Jilly, Paul Theroux has created a remarkable parable of America today. A work of breathtaking imagination and resonance, Millroy the Magician displays the author at the height of his fictional powers, and in Jilly and Millroy he has created two truly unforgettable characters.",

Hardly have the newlyweds arrived when the peaceful home of Hock's mother-in-law, Violet, is disrupted by two racist cops hunting for Ruby's cousin Perry Duclat, who has been living with Violet since his mother abandoned him. Now this thrown-away child is a grown and troubled man, wanted for murder. The victim is Perry's former cellmate at Angola penitentiary, whose mutilated body has been branded with a bizarre acronym - MOMS. When Perry disappears, Hock teams up with a disenchanted New Orleans cop to conduct a highly unofficial Investigation. Before justice is finally done, there are more brutal murders - and more brandings. Among the slain: a little boy so alone in the world he can only guess at his name. Besides the terrible murders, Hock must resolve personal quandaries: the meaning of Ruby's unsettling emotions about returning to her southern roots, and his own future - if any - with the New York Police Department.",

        "Title": "The State of the Nation: Government and the Quest for a Better Society",
        "Authors": "By Bok, Derek Curtis",
        "Description": "Never before have Americans been so anxious about the future of their society. But rarely has anyone offered a clear statement about why, in a nation so prosperous, free, and stable, we tend to assume that the country is in dire straits and that the government can do little to help. This book is just such a statement, an eloquent assessment of where America stands, how our society has changed in the past half-century, and who or what is responsible for our current frustrations.Derek Bok examines the nation's progress in five areas that Americans generally consider to be of paramount importance: economic prosperity, quality of life, opportunity, personal security, and societal values. He shows that although we are better off today in most areas than we were in 1960, we have performed poorly overall compared with other leading industrial nations. And when it comes to providing adequate health care at a reasonable cost, educating our young people for high-skilled jobs, alleviating poverty and urban blight, and reducing crime, our record has been dismal. Comparing the United States with other leading industrial nations on more than sixty key indicators, Bok shows that we rank below average in more than two-thirds of the cases and at the bottom in more than half.What has caused this decline, and what can be done about it? In virtually all important areas of American life, Bok concludes, government policies have played a significant, often decisive role in accounting for our successes as well as our failures. But whereas others call for downsizing the federal government, Bok argues that government is essential to achieving America's goals. In short, Ronald Reagan was only half right. Government is the problem. But it is also the most important part of the solution. By assessing the state of the nation and identifying the reasons for its current condition, this book helps set the agenda for improving America's performance in the future.",

        "Description": "Detective Inspector Nick Trevellyan and his elegant lover, businesswoman Alison Hope, should have stayed longer in Venice. They have just returned from a romantic Italian holiday when Nick must take charge of a murder case that profoundly shocks and disturbs their West Country village of Little Hopford.Eighteen-year-old Ben Lawson has worked hard to pass his exams and qualify for college. Only Frisco Carstairs now stands in his way. The young girl - reputed in the village to be essentially amoral in her sexual inclinations - watches smugly as Ben tells his mother that he and Frisco are engaged. Alison and Nick understand only too well the overwhelming power of sexual passion, especially among the young. They also understand that Ben has broken his mother's heart. Is Ben so besotted by Frisco that he will marry her and relinquish his mother's dreams? The diamond on Frisco's finger suggests his answer.\"Over my dead body,\" says Ben's mother, but it's Frisco's body that is found near an isolated country lane. Strangled with her own scarf, vulnerable in death as she never seemed to be in life, Frisco no longer poses a threat to any of the good citizens of Little Hopford.Initially assuming that he has an open-and-shut case, Nick discovers that Alison may hold the key to a crime of passion that is much subtler and more complex than anyone could have guessed. Nick is the professional detective, but it's Alison who often leads the way to the truth.Witty, romantic, evocative of the richness and eccentricity of English village life, Time of Hope confirms Susan B. Kelly's reputation as one of the most promising and original new talents on the crime-writing scene.",

        "Description": "The Blue Nowhere will forever change the way you feel about your computer.  Jeffery Deaver, bestselling author of The Empty Chair and The Bone Collector, now turns to the labyrinthine world of cyberspace -- a world where safety is elusive, appearances are deceiving, and the most powerful can lose their wealth, their minds, their lives with a hacker's touch of a button.  When a sadistic hacker, code-named Phate, sets his sights on Silicon Valley, his victims never know what hit them. He infiltrates their computers, invades their lives, and -- with chilling precision -- lures them to their deaths. To Phate, each murder is like a big, challenging computer hack: every time he succeeds, he must challenge himself anew -- by taking his methodology to a higher level, with bigger targets.  Desperate, the head of The California State Police Computer Crimes Division frees Wyatt Gillette, imprisoned for hacking, to aid the investigation -- against the loud protests of the rest of the division.With an obsession emblematic of hackers, Gillette fervently attempts to trace Phate's insidious computer virus back to its source. Then Phate delivers a huge blow, murdering one of the division's own -- a \"wizard\" who had pioneered the internet -- and the search takes on a zealous intensity. Gillette and Detective Frank Bishop, an old-school homicide cop who's accustomed to forensic sleuthing, at first make an uneasy team. But with a merciless and brilliant killer like Phate in their crosshairs, and his twisted game reaching a fever pitch, they must utilize every ounce of their disparate talents to stop him.  Hot on the trail of the New York Times bestseller The Empty Chair, The Blue Nowhere once again demonstrates that Deaver is \"the master of ticking-bomb suspense\" (People). It is a truly stunning tale of suspense in the computer age.",

But her quiet, isolated life takes an unexpected turn when her sister's husband, Wim, appears, a man she has not seen for ten years, since their urgent love affair ended in tragedy. Wim, now dying of cancer, feels the need to see Leandra one last time.In alternating, distinctly American voices -- one the twang of a New England Yankee, the other a gentle Southern drawl -- these two characters tell a wistful, wonderfully evoked story, from their first meeting, when Leandra was summoned to Boston to care for her pregnant, depressed sister, to the growing passion that led them beyond common sense and caution. As the narrative alternates between past and present, Leandra and Wim lay claim to the love they've denied themselves and each other.With a sure sense of language and the kind of detail that rings with truth, Susan Dodd creates characters who will resonate in the reader's mind long after their tale reaches its inevitable end. Soft-spoken, sensitive, and deeply moving, The Mourners' Bench is literary fiction at its best, a powerfully eloquent novel of love, loss, regret, and rediscovery.",

This time Roberts explores Philadelphia's unique flesh and blood \"historical monument\"-- the Mummers, who live (and perhaps are willing to die) for a few hours of glory every New Year's Day.The famous Mummers' Parade is an extravaganza that draws enormous crowds who cheer through chattering teeth, as more than thirty thousand clowns, string bands, and fancy brigades strut their stuff up Broad Street. But this year, while the music blares and the Mummers dance, a reveling Pierrot suddenly sinks to the ground, shot dead.Amanda is, at first, only a horrified spectator. But when the prime suspect--her friend and fellow teacher at Philly Prep--falsely claims to have been with her at the time of the murder, Amanda can no longer stay on the sidelines.Is the murder a flare-up of deadly rivalries? Is it connected with the disappearance, the week before Christmas, of another Mummer, the heir to a meat-packing family? Does someone disapprove of the Mummers' feathers, sequins, and string bands? And why is no one in the tight-knit world Amanda investigates willing to tell the truth about anything?With Amanda on the scene, the who in whodunit doesn't stay secret for long. In The Mummers' Curse, Gillian Roberts is, as always, at the head of the parade.",

Nowhere else does politics make stranger bedfellows; and the approaching mayoral election is stranger than most, pitting the usual thugs and vipers against a seeming breath of fresh air - Errol Jacomine, a liberal-minded, civic-spirited preacher. The only problem is, in the opinion of Police Detective Skip Langdon, Jacomine is a psychopath and dangerous as hell.On leave of absence from the police force, Skip becomes obsessed with exposing the frightening figure beneath Jacomine's good-guy image. Immediately, an anonymous army of spies and hatchet men go to work on her, and Skip begins to understand that in opposing Jacomine, she is risking not only her livelihood but her sanity and possibly the lives of people she loves.Skip's instincts seem confirmed when the only witness to Jacomine's crimes turns up dead. Skip thinks there are more bodies buried in Jacomine's past, but it's the present she's worried about. And protecting one of her own against the preacher's evil sends Skip to the dark center of bayou country, where even the elements are her enemies. A deadly chase through the swamp during a fierce hurricane forces Skip to rely not on the kindness of strangers but on her own inner strength to survive.",

Vanity Fair called him a \"big trouble\" lawyer?i.e., the lawyer you call when you're in it.    In this candid memoir, written in the months before his death, Liman discusses his life in the law from the moment Roy Cohn's performance at the McCarthy hearings inspired him to become a lawyer (in order to stand against lawyers like Cohn) to his influential investigation of the Attica prison uprising, through his role as chief counsel in the Iran-Contra hearings, with looks at many fascinating cases, clients, and controversies along the way. Full of lively portraits of the moguls, financiers, politicians and criminals with whom Liman worked, and grounded in his insightful, provocative opinions on the practice of law and on today's legal issues, Lawyer is an absorbing read.",

        "Description": "Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Marcel Proust and Virginia Woolf, Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy, Louis Armstrong and Mae West, Woody Allen and Dorothy Parker--these are but a few of the figures who have given voice to our century's most memorable quotations. Now, in The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations, A.J. Augarde gathers together 6,000 of the best known quotes from our time, drawn from novels, plays, poems, essays, speeches, films, radio and television, songs, and even advertisements.     Here readers will find the history-making quotes, from Churchill's stirring wartime speeches (\"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\"), to Neville Chamberlain's infamous \"Peace for our time,\" to Spiro T. Agnew's outrageous \"If you've seen one city slum you've seen them all.\" On the lighter side, readers will enjoy such wits as Woody Allen (\"It's not that I'm afraid to die. I just don't want to be there when it happens\"), Fran Lebowitz (\"Food is an important part of a balanced diet\"), and Dorothy Parker (\"This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force\"). There are generous excerpts from literature, from the novels of Hemingway and Joyce, the poetry of Auden, Eliot, and Pound, the plays of Lillian Hellman and Anita Loos, and the lyrics of Irving Berlin and Cole Porter (\"In olden days a glimpse of stocking / Was looked on as something shocking / Now, heaven knows, / Anything goes\"). Augarde also includes famous book titles (such as Shepherd Mead's \"How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\"), song titles (Larry Morey's \"Whistle While You Work\"), even cartoon captions (Bill Maudlin's wartime \"I feel like a fugitive from the law of averages\"). And of course, the book brims with wisdom, from Count Ciano's \"Victory has a hundred fathers, but defeat is an orphan,\" to Lord Morley's \"You have not converted a man because you have silenced him,\" to Alfred Adler's \"It is always easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.\" Designed both for reference and for browsing, the Dictionary arranges quotations in alphabetical order by author, with attributions after each quote so that readers can, if they wish, return to the original sources.  In addition, the index helps the reader trace quotations from their most important keywords, so that if you know the quote but not the author, you can still find it easily.      Whether you want to find out who first used the expression \"a walk on the wild side\" (it was Nelson Algren) or simply enjoy discovering fine turns of phrase or witty remarks (such as Beatrice Lillie's off-the-cuff comment to a waiter who spilled soup on her dress: \"Never darken my Dior again\"), The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations offers a unique view of the twentieth century through some of its most memorable bon mots.",

        "Description": "This interpretive study analyzes the complex politics of literature, criticism, and professionalism.  While affirming the profound importance of political analysis--from the ideological critique of literary texts to the social and economic critique of academic institutions--Hogan reassesses the poststructuralist doctrines that underlie much recent work in this area.  He presents extended expositions and criticisms of the views of several influential poststructuralist writers, including Jacques Derrida and Luce Irigaray.  In keeping with recent \"post-poststructuralist\" trends in France and elsewhere, Hogan argues for the political necessity of rational inference, and empirical enquiry, guided by ethical, and more specifically Kantian, considerations.  In the process, he convincingly formulates a general theory of ideology that recognizes the crucial link between literary politics and the concrete political issues that affect the lives of real men and women in the real world of social and material life.  His study concludes with an economic analysis of the institutions of literary study, outlining some anarchist implications for their restructuring.",

        "Description": "In this remarkable book, two of America's best-known journalists use their unparalleled access to the major players to examine The System, specifically as it operated during the ferocious battle over the Clinton effort to provide universal health insurance for Americans - and they come to some startling conclusions about America's future.From the beginning of the struggle, Johnson and Broder gained the confidence of more than one hundred of the participants, including the President and the First Lady; key congressional leaders like Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, Ted Kennedy, and George Mitchell; the many competing special interests; and, outside the Beltway, ordinary citizens and workers on the battlefront of medical care. The authors have written a brilliant chronicle of the battle - of lost opportunities in the White House and of the savage determination and cunning tactics of the Gingrich forces, who plotted secretly for more than a year in advance to kill health care reform in an attempt to regain control of Congress and lead a conservative Republican Revolution that would fundamentally alter American government, privatize public function, and dismantle progressive programs and policies established over the last sixty years. Filled with stunning disclosures about the President and his supporters and adversaries, The System is an extraordinary portrait of democracy under siege, providing one of the most candid looks at American politics and government ever written. It is a book of vital importance to every American and is certain to become a classic in years to come.",

        "Description": "Here is an unprecedented look from the inside at big-time college sports, a memoir that bears equal comparison to Jill Ker Conway's The Road from Coorain and John Feinstein's A Season on the Brink. Taking us to the center of the high-pressure world of college basketball, Terry Phelps, wife of longtime Notre Dame head basketball coach Digger Phelps, shares the richly rewarding story of their life at Notre Dame and offers a surprising look at the Notre Dame sports mystique.In twenty years as Notre Dame's basketball coach, Digger Phelps won nearly 400 games. But his proudest statistic was his team's unparalleled 100 percent graduation rate. It could only have happened at Notre Dame, where President Theodore Hesburgh insisted that athletes be students too. During those two decades, not content to be just a \"lovelywife\" in sportscaster's parlance, Terry discovered a different Notre Dame mystique. For her it existed not on the football field or the basketball court, but in the classrooms, the campus ministry office, and all the other places where the spotlight rarely shines. Earning three degrees at Notre Dame, Terry became the first female \"triple Domer\" and a tenured professor in the law school. Notre Dame made her, she writes, \"a person who could talk about the soul without being embarrassed.\"Believing fervently in Notre Dame's ideals and happily raising their three children in the midst of the larger Notre Dame family, Terry and Digger were unprepared for the changes that occurred when Father Hesburgh retired. Under a new administration the ugliness of college sports elsewhere began to infect Notre Dame basketball, as the athletic department insisted on a schedule that left the players less and less time to be students and began to undercut Digger's position as one of the most respected and successful coaches in America. A formerly supportive campus atmosphere now became increasingly hostile.What happened next, as Terry and Digger battled to preserve their vision of Notre Dame sports at its best, is a story of absorbing human interest, narrated by Terry Phelps with astonishing grace and emotional honesty.",

There was only one problem: this program had been specifically designed for gifted and talented students, the best and the brightest from America's most privileged high schools.Kersjes believed that, given a chance, his kids could do as well as anybody, and with remarkable persistence broke down one barrier after another, from his own principal's office to the inner sanctum of NASA, until Space Camp opened its doors, on an experimental basis, to special ed students. After nine months of rigorous preparation, during which the class molded itself into a working team, they arrived at Space Camp, where they turned in a performance so startling, so surprising, that it will leave the reader breathless.

        "Description": "Does it matter which books college students read? Indeed it does, contends James Atlas. What we read has crucial implications for both our development as individuals and our ability to establish consensus on national issues. We are what we read.Where once the giants of Western thought - Aristotle, Plato, Shakespeare, Milton, and Dante - had pride of place, university courses now boast authors such as Raymond Chandler, Alice Walker, and Louis L'Amour. Traditionalists argue that abandoning the \"Great Books\" spells doom for America's education system, a system that multiculturalists have called a white, elitist scam that fails to reflect America's multi-ethnic, non-European heritage.Has the \"opening\" of the curriculum gone too far? Atlas's attempt to answer this question takes him to university classrooms across America, where the canon of \"Great Books\" is being dismantled in the name of political correctness, and into his own past, as he considers the influence of these books on his own life.As ethnic groups reassert their identities and break from traditional assimilation, Atlas argues, America's need for common ground is greater than ever. Unless there is a set of core beliefs upon which to build consensus, there may soon be no clear idea of America, no common heritage, and no unified future.Like The Closing of the American Mind and The Disuniting of America, Battle of the Books is a powerful, unsettling argument that calls attention to a looming crisis in American education.",

In fact, he may be lying. But something about these missing links appeals to Spenser, and he agrees to take the case.So begins an odyssey into the netherworld of disorganized crime: from the throne rooms of crime lords to the Vegas strip; from two-bit wiseguys with a genius for dangerous liaisons to gangsters' molls in jeopardy; from larceny to homicide. And that's just for openers. All too soon, it becomes clear that what's at stake is not young love, but control of gangland Boston. Spenser and Hawk find themselves dead-center in a circus of violence whose shadowy ringmaster is all too familiar to a private eye with a past.",

Working in a small-town emergency room, knowing that her every move sparks gossip, Abby nonetheless begins to feel at home - until the first undiagnosable patients start showing up.Abby calls them NIWWs: No Idea What's Wrong. And despite her considerable skills, she can't crack these baffling, seemingly random cases. At the same time, Josh is experiencing blinding headaches and pain-driven episodes of manic, even violent, behavior.Abby wonders whether Colstar could somehow be poisoning the town. Her suspicions are shared by ER colleague Dr. Lew Alvarez, whose investigating committee has shrunk from several dozen members to a cautious three. When Abby finds herself playing a dangerous game of cat and mouse with Colstar's steely head of security, Lew warns her that her predecessor in the ER, a Colstar detractor, died in a dubious climbing accident.But Abby cannot back off. She loses a patient in the ER, the victim of a murderous rage in a normally easygoing man. Another patient nearly dies during a routine diagnostic test. And Abby starts to question everyone and everything in the now hostile town of Patience - while her most dangerous enemy is far closer than she thinks.",

The slow pace of life there is entirely controlled by an aging matriarch, Alice Beaumont, owner of the town's only significant enterprise - a successful apparel factory. But a hideous double murder has rocked Galilee's ruling family, tearing the town apart. Alice's younger daughter, Lorrie, and her husband, Ronnie, have been shot to death in Alice's parlor, and their infant daughter has been snatched from her crib. The local district attorney, Morgan Fletcher, is closely tied to the Beaumont family ... but he is also the brother of the chief suspect, and must remove himself from investigating the crime.Thrust into this awful scenario is Kelsey Thatch, a young assistant DA sent from Austin as special prosecutor by the attorney general. At once, she feels the heavy hand of Alice Beaumont, pushing for the indictment and speedy trial of Billy Fletcher, who is Morgan's brother and her factory manager. Kelsey soon discovers that the townspeople's loyalties are fiercely divided between the accuser and the accused - and the entire population of Galilee is fixed in a grid of interlocking relationships that govern each one's actions.",

Simon provides the first behind-the-scenes look at the private deliberations and deep disagreements of the justices of the Rehnquist Court at a critical juncture in the history of the modern Supreme Court. But more than that, he gives us the inside story of a conservative judicial revolution that failed.Simon focuses on four crucial areas of civil rights and liberties - racial discrimination, abortion, criminal law, and First Amendment freedoms - to chronicle the most intense confrontations between the old liberal order and the emerging conservative majority. He takes us into the courtroom where the cases were argued, into the closed conferences where they were fiercely debated, and into the justices' private chambers where strong personalities and wills often collided.In fascinating detail, Simon shows that it was the internal dynamic among the justices - and their desire to stake out independent positions - that ultimately discouraged the wholesale revolution that Reagan, Bush, and Rehnquist hoped to achieve.This is a compelling, behind-the-scenes account of how the justices fought - sometimes diplomatically, sometimes with bare-knuckled determination - for the soul of the Court, and of how, in the end, the center held.",
