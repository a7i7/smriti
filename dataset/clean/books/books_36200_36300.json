Their insights shook our perception of who we are and where we stand in the world, and in their wake have left an uneasy coexistence: science vs. religion, faith vs. empirical inquiry. Which is the keeper of truth? Which is the true path to understanding reality?After forty years of study with some of the greatest scientific minds, as well as a lifetime of meditative, spiritual, and philosophic study, the Dalai Lama presents a brilliant analysis of why all avenues of inquiry\u2014scientific as well as spiritual\u2014must be pursued in order to arrive at a complete picture of the truth. Through an examination of Darwinism and karma, quantum mechanics and philosophical insight into the nature of reality, neurobiology and the study of consciousness, the Dalai Lama draws significant parallels between contemplative and scientific examinations of reality. This breathtakingly personal examination is a tribute to the Dalai Lama\u2019s teachers\u2014both of science and spirituality. The legacy of this book is a vision of the world in which our different approaches to understanding ourselves, our universe, and one another can be brought together in the service of humanity.",

It begins at a prestigious music school in New York City. A killer flees the scene of a homicide and locks himself in a classroom. Within minutes, the police have him surrounded. When a scream rings out, followed by a gunshot, they break down the door. The room is empty.  Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs are brought in to help with the high-profile investigation. For the ambitious Sachs, solving the case could earn her a promotion. For the quadriplegic Rhyme, it means relying on his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e to ferret out a master illusionist they've dubbed \"the conjurer,\" who baits them with gruesome murders that become more diabolical with each fresh crime. As the fatalities rise and the minutes tick down, Rhyme and Sachs must move beyond the smoke and mirrors to prevent a terrifying act of vengeance that could become the greatest vanishing act of all.",

        "Authors": "By Richardson, Cheryl",
        "Description": "In her most provocative work to date, Cheryl Richardson, the New York Times bestselling author of Take Time for Your Life and Life Makeovers, challenges readers to begin an interactive training program that will transform internal obstacles such as self-doubt, conflict phobia, and a fear of what others think, into a new foundation of courage, confidence, and self-esteem. By investing in their personal and spiritual development, readers will build a strong character that allows them to create a larger vision for their lives -- a vision of service and contribution to themselves and the world. Part mentor/part best friend, Cheryl Richardson picks up where her two earlier books leave off, by offering new \"inner life skills\" to readers who are ready to stop hiding their power and start living according to their Divine assignment. Using real life stories and examples (including her own), she offers a practical, step-by-step plan to:   Build self-trust and inner confidence by strengthening your relationship with yourself and your inner life.Identify and eliminate the thoughts, words, and actions that rob you of power and self-esteem.Face \"conflict phobia\" head-on by telling the truth with grace and love. Use fear as an ally to build your courage muscles. Pass up good for great by centering your life around your values.   As readers work through each phase of the program, they will find that they have not only the power and vision to fulfill their greatest potential but the ability to help others do the same. Stand Up for Your Life is a practical, hands-on guide that will inspire readers to own (and use) their talents and gifts so they can lead passionate, more fulfilling lives.",

        "Description": "How do we decide what foods to eat? In recent years, this simple question has become complicated beyond belief\u2014as supermarkets have grown to warehouse size, and as the old advice to eat foods from four food groups has been overrun by questions about organic foods, hormones, pesticides, carbohydrates, trans fats, omega-3s, supplements, health claims, extreme diets, and, above all, obesity.Fortunately, Marion Nestle is here to tell us what\u2019s what\u2014to give us the facts we need to make sensible choices from the bewildering array of foods available to us. With What to Eat, this renowned nutritionist takes us on a guided tour of the supermarket, explaining the issues with verve and wit as well as a scientist\u2019s expertise and a food lover\u2019s experience.Today\u2019s supermarket is ground zero for the food industry, a place where the giants of agribusiness compete for sales with profits\u2014not nutrition or health\u2014in mind. Nestle walks us through the supermarket, section by section: produce, dairy, meat, fish, packaged foods, breads, juices, bottled waters, and more. Alongthe way, she untangles the issues, decodes the labels, clarifies the health claims, and debunks the sales hype. She tells us how to make sensible choices based on freshness, taste, nutrition, health, effects on the environment, and, of course, price. With Nestle as our guide, we learn what it takes to make wise food choicesand are inspired to act with confidence on that knowledge.What to Eat is the guide to healthy eating today: comprehensive, provocative, revealing, rich in common sense, informative, and a pleasure to read.",

In fact, many of us hold deeply ingrained attitudes and assumptions that work against long-term marital happiness. From renowned family therapist Dr. William J. Doherty, this book helps couples pinpoint hidden marital problems and take positive steps to stay close and connected every day. Readers learn to break free of such common traps as confusing desires with needs, applying a trade-in-the-old-model consumer mentality to one's own spouse, or becoming overtime parents instead of full-time partners. They get suggestions for creating relationship rituals that stand the test of time; from mundane to celebratory, sexy to silly. For  young couples who want to hold tight to happily-ever-after, or longtime marrieds on the brink of breakup, this book shows how to fight back to restore a marriage worth saving.",

        "Description": "Caroline Myss, author of the New York Times bestsellers Anatomy of the Spirit and Why People Don\u2019t Heal and How They Can, presents an exciting, highly original program in this long-awaited book. Based on her internationally popular workshop of the same name, Sacred Contracts is a brilliant synthesis of psychology, healing guidance, and spiritual insight.As a medical intuitive, Myss has found that people often don\u2019t understand their purpose in life, which has led to a spiritual malaise of epidemic proportions. This metaphysical disease in turn leads to depression, anxiety, fatigue, and eventually physical illness.But our purpose\u2014our individual Sacred Contract\u2014is often difficult to apprehend. For this reason, Myss developed an enjoyable and ingenious process for deciphering your own Contract using a new theory of archetypes that builds on the works of Jung, Plato, and contemporary thinkers. She first recounts how the concept of Sacred Contracts took form in myths and other cultural traditions through the ages. She then examines the lives of the spiritual masters and prophets\u2014Abraham, Jesus, the Buddha, and Muhammad\u2014whose archetypal journeys illustrate the four stages of a Sacred Contract and provide clues for discovering your own.With her signature motivational style and stories, Myss explains how you can identify your particular spiritual energies, or archetypes\u2014the gatekeepers of your higher purpose\u2014and use them to help you find out what you are here on earth to learn and whom you are meant to meet. In coming to know your archetypal companions, you also begin to see how to live your life in ways that make the best use of your personal power and lead you to fulfill your greatest\u2014in fact, your divine\u2014potential. In this process, you learn how to see your life\u2014and the lives of others\u2014symbolically, allowing you to manage your personal power without getting caught up in emotional drama. You will also learn how to fulfill your Sacred Contract: what you and only you are here on earth to do. Finally, Myss offers specific guidance for locating your physical and emotional vulnerabilities and healing any susceptible areas.Both visionary and practical, Sacred Contracts is a completely unique process of self-discovery and spiritual archaeology and a bold, powerful work of spiritual wisdom.",

And what does it mean when people who interact with Dr. Pearl report a sudden ability to access this healing energy not just for themselves, but for others, too? What is this phenomenon?
