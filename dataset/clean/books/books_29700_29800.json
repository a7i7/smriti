        "Description": "The originality, concentrated power and \"fierce indignation\" of his satirical writing have earned Jonathan Swift (1667\u20131745) a reputation as the greatest prose satirist in English language. Gulliver's Travels is, of course, his world-renowned masterpiece in the genre; however, Swift wrote other, shorter works that also offer excellent evidence of his inspired lampoonery. Perhaps the most famous of these is \"A Modest Proposal,\" in which he straight-facedly suggests that Ireland could solve its hunger problems by using its children for food. Also included in this collection are \"The Battle of the Books,\" \"A Meditation upon a Broomstick,\" \"A Discourse Concerning the Mechanical Operation of the Spirit,\" and \"An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity in England.\" This inexpensive edition will certainly be welcomed by teachers and students of English literature, but its appeal extends to any reader who delights in watching a master satirist wield words as weapons.",

At first sight, the Griffens may seem like a normal blue collar family from Quonochontaug Rhode Island, but Peter (the family's loutish dad), Brian (the erudite, martini\u2013swilling pet dog) and Stewie (the evil toddler son) set them apart from all others. Now Stewie\u2013\u2013a true baby genius and the most popular of the Griffen clan\u2013\u2013speaks out. Having been hell bent on achieving world domination ever since he escaped the cursed ovarian Bastille he was incarcerated in for nine grueling months, he has finally decided that in order to rule the world we live in one must first understand it. Herewith are his musings on family, love, parenting, preschool, work, pop culture, politics and more. If only we knew then what Stewie knows now, adults everywhere could have defeated their mother's matriarchal tyranny and toppled the \"gynocracy\" she ruled over . . .and god knows what else! This book is for the insufferable child in us all, eager to buck the ways of the old guard or just eager for a laugh.",

        "Title": "Memos to the President: A Guide through Macroeconomics for the Busy Policymaker",
        "Authors": "By Schultze, Charles L.",
        "Description": "When policymakers are in need of economic advice, professional economists are never far away. Policymakers, journalists, and citizens all rely on experts to explain various economic developments and policy proposals. While it is fortunate that experts are close at hand, those concerned with choosing or evaluating economic policies should themselves have an understanding of how the economy works. Unfortunately, many policymakers and interested citizens currently lack such knowledge; and they need to know at the least the basics of macroeconomics to make informed decisions on their own.  In this insightful book, Charles L. Schultze employs an imaginative format for explaining to busy policymakers and citizens how the economy works and what issues are likely to affect macroeconomic policy. He imagines that the next president has promised to devote one hour a week to learning about key economic principles and has asked the chairman  of the Council of Economic Advisers for instruction. The book is written as a series of memos to the president on the principles and policy issues that should be understood before making macroeconomic policy judgements.  A former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers himself, Schultze clearly explains the key relationships as a background for policy decisions&#151;relationships among domestic and foreign economic forces, and government policies and economic outcomes. The memos rely heavily on the use of real-world examples from recent economic events and policy debates. They focus principally on such policy-related issues as inflation, unemployment, long-term economic growth, and the flow of international trade and capital.  The series of short, easy-to-read memos is divided into three groups: the first presents the background, explaining why it is particularly important for policymakers to distinguish between those economic forces that affect total demand in the economy and those that affect total supply; the second addresses the problem of economic stability; and the third looks at long-term economic growth.",

        "Description": "George Washington laughing? That the venerable Father of Our Country, the austere and unfailingly honest leader of historical record and legend, had a penchant for tall tales and crafty quips seems unthinkable to most Americans, even today. In The Wit & Wisdom of the Founding Fathers, historian and scholar Paul Zall shatters the sober image of American icons George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin to reveal - and celebrate - their natural bent for incisive, spirited humor.With ample quotes from personal correspondence and private memoirs, Zall peers behind the staid and serious facade of our first three presidents and demonstrates how each strove to suppress his sense of mirth to maintain a dignified public reputation. By lifting the curtain on our Founding Fathers as they engage in practical jokes and regale friends with humorous stories, Zall opens a window on their personalities otherwise obscured by our preconceptions of them as larger-than-life historical figures. While Franklin's humor and wisdom is legendary thanks to his authorship of Poor Richard's Almanac, readers will be surprised to learn that Washington had a penchant for biting sarcasm; that Adams engaged in direct, colloquial, even vulgar, humor; and that Jefferson, our most cerebral president, enjoyed laughing at the absurdity of his own situation as leader of the nation.",

Brief biographies touch on the lives of physicist Enrico Fermi, politicians Fiorello LaGuardia and Rudolph Giuliani, sportsman Joe DiMaggio, and many others.This important new series documents and dramatizes the immigration experience of untold numbers of men, women, and children who arrived in America from the four corners of the world. As they assimilated into American society, they enriched the nation\u2019s character and experience. Many of America\u2019s immigrants passed through the Ellis Island Immigration Center in New York Harbor during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. What were the initial hopes and fears of these new arrivals? Where did they first settle, and what kinds of work did they find? Which elements from their various cultures have since blended into the national scene and helped reshape what has become modern America?  The first titles in this dramatic series bring alive the experiences of four important ethnic groups, with contemporary photos and first-person accounts of their dramatic, life-changing experiences. Readers glimpse each group\u2019s social customs, family life, traditional food and drink, festivals, and much more. There are also brief but vivid capsule biographies of famous individuals who rose to prominence from each ethnic group. Approximately 150 illustrations in each book.",

Both are beautifully crafted dramas that celebrate Irish gifts for lyrical language.

And here, for the first time, is an anthology of poems from the show, chosen by the narrator for their wit, their frankness, their passion, their \"utter clarity in the face of everything else a person has to deal with at 7 a.m.\"   The title Good Poems comes from common literary parlance. For writers, it's enough to refer to somebody having written a good poem. Somebody else can worry about greatness. Mary Oliver's \"Wild Geese\" is a good poem, and so is James Wright's \"A Blessing.\" Regular people love those poems. People read them aloud at weddings, people send them by e-mail.   Good Poems includes poems about lovers, children, failure, everyday life, death, and transcendance. It features the work of classic poets, such as Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and Robert Frost, as well as the work of contemporary greats such as Howard Nemerov, Charles Bukowski, Donald Hall, Billy Collins, Robert Bly, and Sharon Olds. It's a book of poems for anybody who loves poetry whether they know it or not.",

The latter essay is recognized as one of the pioneer documents in the conservation and national park movement in America.",

Growing up in 1950s suburbia when father knew best and there was a sitcom to prove it, he began to regard authority with a jaundiced eye at an early age. And as that sentiment grew stronger with each passing year, so did his ability to hone in on the absurd.True to form, he puts common sense above ideology and distills hilarious, biting commentary on all things politically and culturally relevant. \"No one is safe from Lewis Black's comic missiles.\" (New York Times)You have been warned....",

        "Description": "Why not live at 60 feeling like you did at 35?Thousands of Americans are younger today than they were five years ago. How is that possible? By following the specific recommendations that reverse aging in Dr. Michael Roizen's bestselling book RealAge\u00ae: Are You As Young As You Can Be?, people who were previously much older than their chronological age have now taken up to twentynine years off their biological ages. Since that first publication, more than 10 million people have taken the RealAge\u00ae test in one form or another, and thousands of people have thanked Dr. Roizen for helping them make simple changes in their lives -- changes that have made them healthier, younger, and more vibrant. In the last several years, Dr. Roizen and his team have learned much more about the aging process. The RealAge\u00ae Makeover makes sense of recent critical medical findings -- mportant new research on inflammation in your arteries, stress reduction, chronic disease management, hormone replacement therapy, and other choices you can make to keep aging at a distance. You\u2019ll also find the latest on vitamins and other supplements, which are age-reducing, which are aging, and which ones to avoid if you are taking certain medications. Roizen then offers more than seventy ways to reduce or even prevent 80 percent of the diseases that make you feel older. For example, coffee or the right kind of chocolate in moderate amounts can help reduce inflammation, preserving your arteries, joints, and memory. But the wrong choice can lead to needless aging and loss of energy, such as taking too much Vitamin A. And The RealAge\u00ae Makeover tells you how much (in years) each choice is worth so you can make the choices that are meaningful to you. More potent than any statistic or finding are the personal stories interwoven throughout -- success stories from readers who followed the RealAge program, became biologically younger, and are living happier, healthier lives. With this book, readers have more opportunity than ever to turn back their biological clock to look, feel, and actually be many years younger. Join the RealAge\u00ae Revolution and give yourself a RealAge\u00ae Makeover!",

Barbaraannette Quinn loved her husband, Bobby, right up until the day he got in his Jeep, left their home in Cold Rock, Minnesota, and never returned. She's waited six years for him either to turn up dead or walk through her door with a crooked smile and a pocketful of lies.  Everything changes when Barbaraannette wins the lottery.  Bobby Quinn is alive, well, and watching TV when Barbaraannette suddenly appears on-screen waving a snapshot of him and offering a million dollars to anyone who can find her runaway husband and drag him back to Cold Rock. Bobby and his girlfriend, Phlox, decide that she will turn him in, collect the million bucks, and then they'll both hightail it back to Arizona to live happily ever after.  Unfortunately, everybody wants a piece of Bobby -- including a pair of hulking good ole boys, who figure Bobby owes them, and a sociopathic pretty-boy fresh out of St. Cloud Correctional, who notices that Barbaraannette's offer doesn't require that Bobby arrive alive. Toss in a shy, marathon-running banker, a lovestruck humanities professor, and Barbaraannette's kleptomaniac mother, and things start getting a little hot in Cold Rock.  \"I've really started something, haven't I?\" Barbaraannette says. What she's started is a crackpot criminal conspiracy the likes of which you've never seen. Mrs. Million is Pete Hautman's wildest and funniest work yet, a tale certain to reach the first rank of criminal comedies.",

Simon has gotten himself a reputation for his study of recent local history.The object is an old-fashioned diver's suit, so water-damaged and encrusted that it's not possible to tell without further examination whether there is a body inside. When it turns out to contain one, the speculation is that it is a local man believed to have deserted from the navy in World War II. But questions remain: Is it he or someone else? Was he, as it seems, murdered? And are there more of the Confederate gold coins that were found in the collecting bucket he carried?Simon's common sense tells him that the coins do not indicate a horde of valuable relics still under the waters of the Sound, but, well, something might be there. The romantic-at-heart historian and Julie McGloughan, whom he'd like to think is his girlfriend, tell each other it wouldn't hurt to take a look - but what they find, after a late-night foray and some chancy encounters, couldn't be more of a complete surprise.",

        "Description": "As Ann McMillan's Civil Blood opens, some Richmonders pour into the streets in celebration, while others - slaves, free blacks, Union sympathizers - mourn in secret. Unknown to all of them, another disaster threatens, quieter but more effective than the Union warships: smallpox, the most contagious plague the world has ever known. Narcissa Powers, a white widow turned Confederate nurse, and Judah Daniel, a free black herbalist, joining forces against the outbreak, encounter a frightening possibility: the victims are being infected by tainted money flowing through Richmond's network of speculators and profiteers. Then the disease reaches a Union encampment, leading to accusations of germ warfare. But for Narcissa and Judah Daniel, smallpox strikes its cruelest blow against the city's most vulnerable population: its children.",

He calls it Rover.These hovering blue lights, are they friend or foe? If they save lives, why do they also sometimes kill, and drink the blood of the dying, every drop?

        "Title": "The Shark Mutiny",
        "Authors": "By Robinson, Patrick",
        "Description": "Throughout the fifteenth century, China's blue-water navy fleets dominated all the oceans between the Yellow Sea and the Persian Gulf. But for the next five hundred years, it regressed to a dim echo of its glorious past. However, it is now the year 2007 and the Chinese agenda has changed. With a tremendous navy buildup, anchored by a new base in Burma and a $2 billion oil refinery on the southern Iranian coast, the Chinese are poised not only to challenge America's superiority on the open sea but also to upset the delicate balance of oil power in the Middle East and the free passage of the world's giant tankers.Admiral Arnold Morgan, the President's National Security Adviser, is closely monitoring the Chinese when an oil tanker mysteriously explodes in the Persian Gulf. When it happens a second and then a third time, he knows it is no coincidence.... The Chinese navy, in partnership with Iran, has laid a minefield clean across the Strait of Hormuz, holding the world's oil supply hostage. As a global oil crisis ensues, the world financial markets spiral out of control. Mystified by China's motive yet drawn to action, the United States moves to disarm the mines with a huge display of force, deploying five Carrier Battle Groups, 80 percent of its active sea power.While the sweepers blow out the mines, Morgan characteristically slams back at China. Navy SEAL veteran commanders Rick Hunter and Rusty Bennett lead devastating attacks on China's Indian Ocean power bases. And at the center of the missions is USS Shark, a thirty-year-old nuclear boat on her final tour of duty, commanded by Donald Reid, an officer struggling with his inner demons. His executive officer is Lt. Commander Dan Headley, an intrepid Kentuckian, himself on his way to full command. When the brave SEALs are confronted with the unexpected death of their own, the unimaginable happens: the first mutiny in the modern history of the United States Navy.Meanwhile, the People's Liberation Navy sits and waits for their ultimate gambit, a move so shocking and unexpected that it forces the world to hold its breath. Was the minefield in the strait just a diversion?Featuring an ensemble cast that stretches from the most secretive heart of the Chinese high command to the control room of a U.S. submarine, out onto the screaming flight decks of the great aircraft carriers, all the way to a United States Navy court-martial, The Shark Mutiny is epic in its sweep, meticulous in its authenticity, and breathtaking in its pacing. Terrifying and thrilling, it is the most dramatic story of rebellion on the high seas since The Caine Mutiny.",

But Eve's fiercely protective husband, Roarke, suspects otherwise - and his suspicion proves correct when Trudy, rebuffed by Eve, shows up at his office, demanding money in exchange for keeping the ugly details of Eve's childhood a secret. Using every ounce of willpower he has to restrain himself, he shows her the door - and makes it clear that she'd be wise to get out of the city and never bother them again.Eve and Roarke will be satisfied if Trudy Lombard just heads back to Texas.

        "Authors": "By Barnard, Robert",
        "Description": "England's celebrated, multiple-award-winning master crime novelist returns with a witty and poignant chiller about the evil of gossip and the sin of indifference.  Father Christopher Pardoe is a good priest. He cares about his parishioners. He is also a human being -- and is thus saddled with man's inherent weaknesses. Is it a bit odd, then, how much time the good Father has been spending at the house of a certain young, single mother called Julie Norris? And why, during each of his visits, are Julie's bedroom curtains always closed? Julie looks to be pregnant again. Just who could the father be?  As nasty rumors begin to scorch the parish phone lines, Father Pardoe is suspended from St. Catherine's, and Cosmo Horrocks, the West Yorkshire Chronicle's shameless, muckraking journalist, exploits the story in a big way. Nothing goes over better than a juicy sex-and-the-church scandal, except, perhaps, murder.  Do Father Pardoe and Julie protest too much? Why did Julie's parents throw her out and disown her? Is she really as bad as they say? And what, exactly, does Cosmo Horrocks hear in that London-to-Leeds dining car that makes him tingle with excitement? A tale of chastity besmirched? This story could make his year. But will it lead to tragedy? And, if so, whose?  When Inspector Mike Oddie and Sergeant Charlie Peace are called in to investigate a murder, they are saddened and surprised by the raw emotions -- the hate, the fear -- they find in the outwardly peaceful town of Shipley. There may be only one killer, but there are many others who must share the town's guilt and, perhaps, one day start the process of healing.  Rich with eccentric characters, crisp dialogue, stylish prose, and perceptive insights into human nature, Unholy Dying is vintage Barnard, acknowledged master of suspense.",

YOUR FAULT.\" FOR DETECTIVE CONRAD VOORT, WHAT BEGINS AS A DAY OF CELEBRATION TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE, AS HE TRIES TO STOP A KILLER AND FIGURE OUT IF HE COULD SOMEHOW BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SERIES OF DEATHS.  In the thrilling, fast-paced, and haunting Dead for Life, Voort finds himself in a deadly race against time to stop an ingenious and unsettlingly sympathetic murderer who is intent on carrying out his threat, and who has created a state of near panic throughout Manhattan. What at first seems to be a series of random killings soon takes on a diabolical pattern. Murderer Wendell Nye is a man on a mission, and as his bloody endeavor unfolds it becomes clear that this is not merely the senseless act of some criminal mind, but the impassioned vengeance of a man who has suffered loss beyond endurance. Voort and the killer must reinvent themselves in this life-and-death struggle, battle the past, and become smarter, braver, and more daring -- all by tonight.  Since he first introduced the charismatic Conrad Voort in The Broken Hearts Club, critically acclaimed novelist Ethan Black has continued to shape the multifaceted detective into one of the most true-to-life and emotionally complex protagonists in contemporary suspense fiction. Voort's family members have been police officers in New York since the Dutch settled it. He has trained to be a detective since childhood, and he's head of a vast Voort cop clan. His code of honor dictates that on this day he may have to take himself down.  Drawing the reader ever more deeply into the minds and hearts of two unforgettable men pitted against each other, Dead for Life hurtles toward a shattering climax that will make it apparent that few things are what they seem.
