        "Description": "An elated, victorious Truman brandishes a newspaper with the headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman.\" Theodore Roosevelt galvanizes the crowd with a fiery stump speech. Richard Nixon wipes away sweat during his debate with a poised JFK. Against the backdrop of a towering flag, Reagan captivates crowds with his promise of a stronger, prouder America. Bill Clinton weaves a spell with his saxophone. Throughout American history, few events have commanded the undivided attention of the public the way presidential campaigns have. Now the enduring moments of inspiration, the humiliating gaffes, and the heartbreaking losses of these campaigns are captured in a historic collection of photographs from America's greatest photojournalists.From the divisive election of Abraham Lincoln to the opening salvos of the 2004 campaign, America's presidents -- and pretenders to the office -- come to life in these pages. These men embody not only the drama of their times,  but also the great arc of American history. They are captured here in pivotal and telling campaign moments: on the stage and behind the scenes, on whistle-stop tours, at high-voltage conventions, and in head-to-head debates. Accompanied by political adviser Douglas E. Schoen's trenchant essays, the striking photographs in On the Campaign Trail offer a unique view of the moments that have united and divided us during the race for the presidency. A fascinating journey in words and images, this landmark collection brings home the drama, fanfare, and power of America's great national contest.",

        "Description": "INVENTING THE MIDDLE AGESThe Lives, Works, and Ideas of the Great Medievalists of the Twentieth CenturyIn this ground-breaking work, Norman Cantor explains how our current notion of the Middle Ages-with its vivid images of wars, tournaments, plagues, saints and kings, knights and ladies-was born in the twentieth century. The medieval world was not simply excavated through systematic research. It had to be conceptually created: It had to be invented, and this is the story of that invention. Norman Cantor focuses on the lives and works of twenty of the great medievalists of this century, demonstrating how the events of their lives, and their spiritual and emotional outlooks, influenced their interpretations of the Middle Ages. Cantor makes their scholarship an intensely personal and passionate exercise, full of color and controversy, displaying the strong personalities and creative minds that brought new insights about the past. A revolution in academic method, this book is a breakthrough to a new way of teaching the humanities and historiography, to be enjoyed by student and general public alike. It takes an immense body of learning and transmits it so that readers come away fully informed of the essentials of the subject, perceiving the interconnection of medieval civilization with the culture of the twentieth century and having had a good time while doing it! This is a riveting, entertaining, humorous, and learned read, compulsory for anyone concerned about the past and future of Western civilization.",

        "Description": "An unprecedented look behind the scenes at the \"most powerful committee in the history of the world\" - the men and women closest to the president of the United States who make America's decisions affecting war and peace, who are the architects of everything from covert operations to market bailouts, from secret negotiations to combating terrorism. Running the World draws back the curtain on this shadowy world and in so doing reveals never-before-known details of the very human interactions that have shaped recent history, the rivalries and petty jealousies, the ambition, the moments of vision and greatness, the drama and the humor that suffuse the everyday events and great moments that marked the six decades since the end of World War II.The book is based on 130 exclusive interviews with many of the best-known and the most significant figures to have played a central role in shaping America's national security and foreign policies, including Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, Madelaine Albright, Brent Scowcroft, Robert Rubion, Larry Summers, Tony Lake, William Perry, James Woolsey, and scores of others. The importance of the National Security Council, and all the formal, informal, highly visible and secret groups associated with it, has never been clearer than it is today. David Rothkopf depicts with an eye for both personal detail and historical implications the real events from which today's headlines and Tom Clancy novels are drawn - and includes, for the first time, an in-depth look at the inner workings of the Bush administration from many of its most important current and former players.",

        "Description": "No one can escape a sense of wonder when looking at an organism from within. From the humblest amoeba to man, from the smallest cell organelle to the amazing human brain, life presents us with example after example of highly ordered cellular matter, precisely organized and shaped to perform coordinated functions. But where does this order spring from? How does a living organism manage to do what nonliving things cannot do--bring forth and maintain all that order against the unrelenting, disordering pressures of the universe?In The Touchstone of Life, world-renowned biophysicist Werner Loewenstein seeks answers to these ancient riddles by applying information theory to recent discoveries in molecular biology. Taking us into a fascinating microscopic world, he lays bare an all-pervading communication network inside and between our cells--a web of extraordinary beauty, where molecular information flows in gracefully interlaced circles. Loewenstein then takes us on an exhilarating journey along that web and we meet its leading actors, the macromolecules, and see how they extract order out of the erratic quantum world; and through the powerful lens of information theory, we are let in on their trick, the most dazzling of magician's acts, whereby they steal form out of formlessness.The Touchstone of Life flashes with fresh insights into the mystery of life. Boldly straddling the line between biology and physics, the book offers a breathtaking view of that hidden world where molecular information turns the wheels of life. Loewenstein makes these complex scientific subjects lucid and fascinating, as he sheds light on the most fundamental aspects of our existence.",

        "Title": "Working Under Different Rules (A National Bureau of Economic Research project report)",
        "Authors": "By Freeman, Richard B. (EDT)",
        "Description": "For much of the 20th century, American workers were the world's leaders in productivity, wages, and positive workplace conditions. American unions championed free enterprise and high labor standards, and American businesses dominated the world market. But, as editor Richard B. Freeman cautions in Working Under Different Rules, despite our relatively high standard of living we have fallen behind our major trading partners and competitors in providing good jobs at good pay\u2014what was once considered \"the American dream.\" Working Under Different Rules assesses the decline in the well-being of American workers\u2014evidenced by spiraling income inequality and stagnant real earnings\u2014and compares our employment and labor conditions with those of Western Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia. As these original essays demonstrate, the modern U.S. labor market is characterized by a high degree of flexibility, with rapid employee turnover, ongoing creation of new jobs, and decentralized wage setting practices. But closer inspection reveals a troubling flip side to this adaptability in the form of inadequate job training, more frequent layoffs, and increased numbers of workers pushed to the very bottom of the income scale, into the low wage occupations where much of the recent job growth has occurred. While the variety of works councils prevalent throughout the developed world have done much to foster democratic rights and economic protection for employees, the virtually union-free environment emerging in many areas of the private U.S. economy has stripped workers of a strong collective voice. German apprenticeship programs and the Japanese system of \"job rotation\" represent more effective approaches to preparing workers for the changing demands of lifetime employment. In addition, workers in European advanced economies and in Canada have greater social protection than Americans. But while this has some cost in unemployment and higher taxes, carefully designed social safety nets do not seriously jeopardize economic efficiency. Working Under Different Rules is an illuminating analysis of the often complex interaction of market institutions, social policy, and economic results. The authors' up-to-date international assessment of unions, wage setting, apprenticeship programs, welfare support, and works councils suggests alternate ways of training, paying, and empowering workers that, if effectively adapted, could facilitate the growth of a healthier American economy and better prospects for American workers.",

But to duffers around the globe, he has long been famous for a different role, as the World's Greatest Bad Golfer - the Guru of Bad Golf.Now, working with humorist and fellow hacker Henry Beard, Nielsen has drawn on a lifetime of brilliantly uninspired play to produce the unique collection of useless wisdom, spurious reminiscences, and pointless tips that is the Stupid Little Golf Book.Painstakingly fabricated to look like the result of years of study of the game of golf, the Stupid Little Golf Book contains no dopey drills, no mind-game mumbo jumbo, no swing-wrecking instruction. Just simple commonsense advice on how to needle, wheedle, weasel, wangle, chisel, finagle, connive, and fudge your way to victory on the links, interspersed with heartwarming tales of duplicity, chicanery, mendacity, and truly deplorable sportsmanship.Covering everything from fundamentals, such as the grip (\"always hold the club at the thin end where that length of rubber stuff is, and not the end that has that curvy metal or wooden thing with the number on it...\"), to A Foolproof Way to Knock at Least Six Strokes off Your Score (\"skip the last hole\"), this is, finally, a golf book for the rest of us, by the man who put fun back into the game of golf.",

        "Title": "Ants on the Melon: A Collection of Poems",
        "Authors": "By Adair, Virginia",
        "Description": "One of the most striking achievements of these poems is Mrs. Adair's wedding of traditional rhyme and meter with a sensibility entirely modern, American, sometimes disturbing, occasionally hilarious, always candid. The collection's title poem, \"Ants on the Melon,\" makes a wry, microcosmic comment on overpopulation. \"Surfers\" draws permanent lessons from the transience of youth. \"Break In\" transforms a standard burglary into a moment of bitter but wise resignation. Other poems take as their starting point the Gulf War, Zen Buddhism, or the interstate highway system. This collection's broad subject matter, from mourning to sexual joy to the plaint of an old umbrella, is matched by its chronological range, extending from the poet's childhood - \"Key Ring\" and \"The Grandmothers\" - to her old age, which lies at the heart of such poems as \"Slow Scythe\" and \"Take My Hand, Anna K.\"Mrs. Adair's refusal to publish her first book of poetry until now, at the age of eighty-three, emphasizes the double role of Time as the hero and villain of all human lives, and Time and its rewards and wounds and mercies may be these poems' most profound concern. In his intimate and affectionate Afterword, Robert Mezey, an accomplished poet himself and Mrs. Adair's close friend and literary champion, discusses her reluctance about book publication, and gives us a strong sense of her character and experiences - particularly the devastating impact of her husband's suicide in 1968 and the tragedy of the blindness that struck her in the beginning of this decade. And in the poems we are privileged to make the direct acquaintance, at long last, of this brave and gifted writer.",

They describe how the entrepreneurs in this industry solved the chicken-and-egg problem: merchants will not take cards if few consumers use them, and consumers will not use cards if few merchants take them. They also describe how the payment card companies such as MasterCard and Visa have developed complex systems for coordinating transactions among their thousands of bank members and millions of card-holders and accepting merchants. Evans and Schmalensee also describe recent developments in the industry and consider its likely evolution.",

        "Title": "Years of Renewal",
        "Authors": "By Kissinger, Henry",
        "Description": "Perhaps the best-known American diplomatist of this century, Henry Kissinger is a major figure in world history, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, and arguably one of the most brilliant minds ever placed at the service of American foreign policy, as well as one of the shrewdest, best-informed, and most articulate figures ever to occupy a position of power in Washington.  The eagerly awaited third and final volume of his memoirs completes a major work of contemporary history. It is at once an important historical document and a brilliantly told narrative of almost Shakespearean intensity, full of startling insights, unusual (and often unsparing) candor, and a sweeping sense of history. It begins with the resignation of Richard Nixon -- including Kissinger's final assessment of Nixon's tortured personality and the self-inflicted tragedy that ended his presidency and made Kissinger, for a time, the most powerful man in American government, as well as an intimate and definitive portrait of the man whom Kissinger knew perhaps more closely than anyone -- and then takes the reader through the years of Gerald Ford's administration, in which Kissinger continued to play a decisive role, both as Secretary of State and as the symbol of the continuity of American foreign policy. It shows us a moving and admiring picture of President Ford as a man of decency, shrewd judgment, courage, and decisiveness who led the country through a period of renewal.  Kissinger details the agony of the final U.S. extrication from Vietnam -- with the rise of an increasingly hostile Congress determined to micromanage American foreign policy and the evisceration of the American intelligence community and its consequences for American power -- and takes us inside the White House to show our leaders in a time of crisis.  Indeed, crisis is what this book abounds in: the fall of Cambodia and South Vietnam, the Mayaguez incident and the conflict between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus, the origins of the war in Lebanon -- above all the continuing crisis of the Cold War at its perilous height. Here are brilliant scenes, as only an insider could write them, of the shaping of American foreign policy in the Ford era: the famous shuttle diplomacy by which Kissinger brought a wary Yitzhak Rabin and Anwar Sadat together to begin the return of the Sinai to Egypt and usher in the final reconciliation of Egypt and Israel, the Vladivostok meeting with Leonid Brezhnev that advanced the process of nuclear limitation, the uneasy dialogue with China, the tragedy of the Kurds, the search for European security and freedom -- all the major decisions, conferences, and crises that shaped the world we live in, and that still, in many cases, remain major areas of engagement for the United States.  Kissinger recounts in detail his visits to Africa, which led to major initiatives in Southern Africa, including the historic decision of the white settler government of Rhodesia to accept majority rule, and tells the story of U.S. policy in the Americas, including revealing accounts of policies toward Cuba and Chile in the 1970s.  Above all, here are intimate, candid, and sharply intelligent portraits of world leaders, from Mao Zedong teasing Kissinger with a characterist mixture of brutality and acerbic subtlety, to Leonid Brezhnev, confused, unwell, desperately trying to conceal the Soviet Union's growing difficulties with a facade of blustering bravado, as well as a galaxy of European, Middle Eastern, Asian, Latin American, and African leaders.  Here is a work of scholarship, wisdom, and history, written not by desk-bound academic historian, but by the man who shaped much the history about which he writes, and who perhaps more than any other helped to form the post-Cold War world in which we live, and define America's relationship to the world as the last superpower.  No work of history about the Cold War or the inner workings of government and diplomacy is as revealing, thought-provoking, and far-reaching as this. Years of Renewal is the triumphant conclusion of a major achievement and a book that will stand the test of time as a historical document of the first rank.",

But for the thousands of families of ADHD children, adolescents, and adults, it remains painfully difficult to get clear and authoritative answers to the many questions that this confusing disorder poses. Beyond Ritalin is based on hundreds of sources and over thirty years of research, and is the first book to explain in complete detail exactly how Ritalin affects individuals' social and organizational skills, distractibility, activity level, academic performance, and other areas of behavior.The authors of Beyond Ritalin, who are acknowledged experts on attention deficit disorders, provide a complete road map and guide for coping with ADHD.",

You're not lazy, self-indulgent or undisciplined; you may be one of the millions of people who are sugar sensitive. Many people who suffer from sugar sensitivity don't even know it; they continue to consume large quantities of sweets, breads, pasta or alcohol. These foods can trigger feelings of exhaustion and low self-esteem, yet their biochemical impact makes sugar-sensitive people crave them even more. This vicious cycle can continue for years, leaving sufferers overweight, fatigued, depressed and sometimes alcoholic.  Now there is a solution: in Potatoes Not Prozac Dr. Kathleen DesMaisons gives you the tools you need to overcome sugar dependency, with self-tests to determine your sugar sensitivity as well as an easy-to-follow, drug-free program with a customized diet high in protein and complex carbohydrates. Join the thousands of people who have successfully healed their addiction to sugar, lost weight and attained maximum health and well-being by using Dr. DesMaisons's innovative plan.",

        "Authors": "By Crossen, Cynthia",
        "Description": "In this age of information, sponsored studies have become America's most powerful and popular tool of persuasion. However, in Tainted Truth, we find out that much of what we learn from them is false. Although the studies and surveys wear the guise of objective science, their findings almost invariably reflect their sponsors' intentions. Most such research is designed with a certain outcome in mind, and it is all but guaranteed to achieve that outcome. The result is a compilation of information - the information used every day by voters, consumers and leaders.Manufactured truths dominate the American discourse in Congress, courtrooms, offices, newspapers, magazines and television. Studies have become the vehicle for polishing corporate images, influencing juries, shaping debate on public policy, selling commercial products and satisfying the media's - and the public's - voracious appetite for information. In this blistering expose, Cynthia Crossen shows how deeply this research world has been pervaded by artfully crafted deception - and how it affects us all.Crossen reveals how the manufacturers of silicone breast implants did not disclose information regarding the dangers of the implants; how the demise of the cloth-diaper industry was influenced by questionable statistics published by Procter & Gamble - the leading supplier of disposable diapers; how supermarkets across the country emptied their shelves of apples because of the Alar scare, initiated by highly disputed research from a publicity hungry environmental group; and how even the confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court was influenced by fast and biased polls.As information continues to lose its link to truth, we are all losing our ability to make informed decisions. Tainted Truth is an enormously important and provocative book that will change the way we make our decisions - decisions that have endangered our minds and, in some cases, our lives.",

        "Title": "The Commanding Heights: the Battle Between Government & the Marketplace That Is Remaking the Modern World",
        "Authors": "By Yergin, Daniel and Stanislaw, Joseph",
        "Description": "Trillions of dollars in assets and fundamental political power are changing hands as free markets wrest control from government of the \"commanding heights\" - the dominant businesses and industries of the world economy. Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw demonstrate that words like \"privatization\" and \"deregulation\" are inadequate to describe the enormous upheaval that is unfolding before our eyes. Along with the creation of vast new wealth, the map of the global economy is being redrawn. Indeed, the very structure of society is changing. New markets and new opportunities have brought great new risks as well. How has all this come about? Who are the major figures behind it? How does it affect our lives?The collapse of the Soviet Union, the awesome rise of China, the awakening of India, economic revival in Latin America, the march toward the European Union - all are a part of this political and economic revolution. Fiscal realities and financial markets are relentlessly propelling deregulation; achieving a new balance between government and marketplace will be the major political challenge in the coming years. Looking back, the authors describe how the old balance was overturned, and by whom. Looking forward, they explore these equations: Will the new balance prevail? Or does the free market contain the seeds of its own destruction? Will there be a backlash against any excesses of the free market? And finally, The Commanding Heights illuminates the five tests by which the success or failure of all these changes can be measured, and defines the key issues as we enter the twenty-first century.The Commanding Heights captures this revolution in ideas in accounts of the history and the politics of the postwar years and tales of the astute politicians, brilliant thinkers, and tenacious businessmen who brought these changes about. Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Deng Xiaoping, and Bill Clinton share the stage with the \"Minister of Thought\" Keith Joseph, the broomaker's son Domingo Cavallo, and Friedrich von Hayek, the Austrian economist who was determined to win the twenty-year \"battle of ideas.\" It is a complex and wide-ranging story, and the authors tell it brilliantly, with a deep understanding of human character, making critically important ideas lucid and accessible. Written with unique access to many of the key players, The Commanding Heights, like no other book, brings us an understanding of the last half of the twentieth century - and sheds a powerful light on what lies ahead in the twenty-first century.",

The result is a moving and often startling work that demonstrates how universal our struggles really are despite the variations in our circumstances.What is abundantly clear is that even in the lives of such successful women, the struggle with self-doubt and the conflicts between work and family that afflict the rest of us are still very much in force. And as Walsh poignantly concludes, if women with all the advantages are having trouble, then that says something important about the condition of women's lives overall.In Divided Lives, Elsa Walsh reveals a central theme of contemporary life and offers the comfort of shared understanding to every woman who is striving for balance in her life.",

Known for Portale's defining modern American cooking, impeccable service, and soaring space, Gotham was recently named \"Most Outstanding Restaurant\" in the nation by the James Beard Foundation.But what does Portale cook when he's not working? In Alfred Portale Simple Pleasures, one of our most accomplished chefs invites you to taste the sublime and surprisingly easy-to-prepare, restaurant-quality dishes he serves to friends and family at home.The 125 recipes include home versions of Gotham classics as well as new recipes straight from Portale's home kitchen. They're all simple enough for any home cook, and spectacular enough to impress anyone who tastes them.At the center of Alfred Portale Simple Pleasures are elemental main courses such as Roast Cod with a New England Chowder Sauce, Filet Mignon with Madeira Sauce, and Saut\u00e9ed Chicken Breasts with Button Mushrooms and Sage. Pick one, then build a meal by pairing it with recipes from the chapters of  salads, starters, and small plates; soups, sandwiches, and pizzas; pasta and risotto; side dishes; and desserts.Along with the recipes, Portale offers pairing suggestions for building a menu, variations for adapting recipes according to season and personal taste, and flavor-building instructions on how to accent a dish with extravagant extras such as caviar or everyday additions such as flavored oils.  In other words, home cooks will learn how to add a Gotham-inspired twist to their own favorite recipes.The supermarket-friendly dishes include modern classics such as Spicy Shrimp Salad with Mango, Avocado, and  Lime Vinaigrette; Pumpkin and Caramelized Onion Soup with Gruy\u00e8re and Sage; and Saut\u00e9ed Spinach with Garlic, Ginger, and Sesame Oil. Alfred helps you transform everything from ordinary weekday lunches to Saturday night dinner parties into anything but ordinary.Of course, no meal is complete without dessert, and Portale delivers sweet and sophisticated send-offs, including Lime Meringue Tarts, a simple Summer Plum Pudding, and an elegant Chocolate-Grand Marnier Cake.Alfred Portale Simple Pleasures -- nothing could be simpler or more pleasurable.",

        "Title": "Global Habit: The Drug Problem in a Borderless World",
        "Authors": "By Stares, Paul B.",
        "Description": "The market for illicit drugs is expanding inexorably around the world. More kinds of drugs are becoming more available in more places than ever before. But the drug trade is not only growing, it is changing in character. It has ceased to be a marginal area of criminal activity and has now become a major global enterprise controlled by formidable interests that threaten much more than the health of drug users. Moreover, the immense wealth that has been amassed from selling drugs has given the principal trafficking organizations enormous power to corrupt and intimidate public officials and government institutions.In this major book, Paul Stares presents a compelling portrait of the global drug market and the consequences of this international plague. He explains that there are good reasons to fear that the global market for drugs will continue to expand in the coming years: profits to the traffickers are huge; the revolutionary advances in communications, transportation, and information technology facilitate smuggling, as do the lowering of border controls and trade tariffs and the trends toward privatization and deregulation. Meanwhile, the expanded volume of global trade, travel, and financial transactions makes it harder for customs and police authorities to detect and stop illicit activities. Added to the growing incentives and opportunities to supply illicit drugs, the level of demand is increasing in many new areas of the world, particularly in formerly communist countries and many areas of the developing world.What can done about this growing problem? One option is legalization, but Stares contends that its implementation would be problematic while its benefits remain unclear. Yet, continuing on the present course will not work either. Stares argues that reducing both the supply and demand for illicit drugs requires a fundamental shift away from the current overwhelming emphasis on negative sanctions to deter and deny their production, trafficking, and consumption. Instead, he calls for more positive control measures that primarily rely on persuasion and cooperation. He advocates the creation of a global drug monitoring and evaluation network, a global drug use prevention program, a global drug treatment training program, and an international drug crisis response program.According to Stares, the effectiveness of reorienting drug control policy to curb the global habit will ultimately depend on the international community's willingness to address much larger concerns to which the drug problem is inextricably linked-- including overpopulation, environmental degradation, poverty, illiteracy, ethnic strife, and disease. Only by recognizing the fundamental relationship between these larger issues and the global drug problem can meaningful progress be made.  Selected by Choice as an Outstanding Book for 1996",

        "Description": "In 2001, Captain James \"Yusuf\" Yee was commissioned as one of the first Muslim chaplains in the United States Army. After the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001, he became a frequent government spokesman, helping to educate soldiers about Islam and build understanding throughout the military. Subsequently, Chaplain Yee was selected to serve as the Muslim Chaplain at Guantanamo Bay, where nearly 700 detainees captured in the war on terror were being held as \"unlawful combatants.\"  In September 2003, after serving at Guantanamo for ten months in a role that gave him unrestricted access to the detainees--and after receiving numerous awards for his service there--Chaplain Yee was secretly arrested on his way to meet his wife and daughter for a routine two-week leave. He was locked away in a navy prison, subject to much of the same treatment that had been imposed on the Guantanamo detainees. Wrongfully accused of spying, and aiding the Taliban and Al Qaeda, Yee spent 76 excruciating days in solitary confinement and was threatened with the death penalty.  After the U.S. government determined it had made a grave mistake in its original allegations, it vindictively charged him with adultery and computer pornography. In the end all criminal charges were dropped and Chaplain Yee's record wiped clean. But his reputation was tarnished, and what has been a promising military career was left in ruins.  Depicting a journey of faith and service, Chaplain Yee's For God and Country is the story of a pioneering officer in the U.S. Army, who became a victim of the post-September 11 paranoia that gripped a starkly fearful nation. And it poses a fundamental question: If our country cannot be loyal to even the most patriotic Americans, can it remain loyal to itself?",
