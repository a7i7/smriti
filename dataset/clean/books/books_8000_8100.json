From the days before ballooning to the development of the Boeing 777, flight has fired our imaginations and transformed our lives. Meticulously researched and filled with entertaining first-person anecdotes, little-known historical facts, and offbeat humor, A Brief History of Flight puts into context the social, political, and economic factors that have stoked our passion for flight. You?ll see how big business has helped the most daring?and expensive?inventions get off the ground, laugh at some of history?s most bizarre flight attempts, and even get a rare peek inside some of the earliest passenger \"flight kits.&quot Whether you?re an aviation buff, a business reader, a technology watcher, or simply interested in flight, A Brief History of Flight will leave you wondering what the world of aviation can possibly do for an encore.Critical Praise for T. A. Heppenheime \"Countdown is by far the best history of space flight I have ever read. It is detailed, lucidly written for the layman, and full of fascinating stories.\"?ADRIAN BERRY, Daily Telegraph, ON Countdown: A History of Space Flight\"A lively account of the development of space activities in the U.S. and the Soviet Union . . . as good a one-volume overview of space as exists.\"?Scientific American ON Countdown: A History of Space Flight \"With the precision of a scientist, a good reporter?s marshaling of disparate facts, and the vigor of a natural storyteller, Heppenheimer offers an absorbing narrative.\"?RICHARD SNOW, Editor, American Heritage, ON Turbulent Skies The History of Commercial Aviatio",

Get ready to revisit the laughable roots of today's wizardry and reminisce over doohickey's of decades pastwhen Pong was a gnarly challenge, 0.7734 viewed upside down on a calculator cracked you up, and vacations was a time when you couldn't be contacted.

In recognition of her unique work, the world has lavished on her its highest honors and awards, from the Nobel Peace Prize to the Order of Merit presented by Queen Elizabeth. These she has accepted only in the name of the poor, whom she and her Missionaries of Charity so devotedly serve - 'I am but a pencil in the hands of the Lord, it is his work', she has repeatedly said.Starting out with no resources or preconceived ideas, armed only with her faith, Mother Teresa has created an enormously successful religious order that has spread to over a hundred countries, setting up institutions for the destitute, the handicapped, orphans, the leprosy-affected and the dying. Yet her main work remains in the midst of the slums and the dirt of the streets.",

        "Title": "Michael Olesker's Baltimore: If You Live Here, You're Home",
        "Authors": "By Olesker, Michael",
        "Description": "In this collection of humorous and poignant newspaper columns written for the Baltimore Sun and The News American over the last two decades, Michael Olesker captures the essence of Baltimore\u2014a big city with the heart of a small town. Here in the closing years of the 20th century is Baltimore, with all its unexpected triumphs, crushing troubles, idiosyncratic characters, and lively neighborhoods.Michael Olesker's Baltimore offers a front row seat at the daily skirmishes that mark the city's life. Olesker draws intimate portraits of major politicians and local celebrities, of big names like William Donald Schaefer and Kurt Schmoke, Barbara Mikulski and Bea Gaddy, Artie Donovan and Brooks Robinson, Barry Levinson and John Waters. He gives equal time to players along the fringes\u2014Block denizens, professional gamblers, petty street hustlers\u2014and to the generally unsung heroes who keep the city vibrant and kicking. With articles about the price neighborhoods pay over racial conflicts and about the small deals that are made to get communities through a given day, Michael Olesker's Baltimore deepens our understanding of the city's people and their resilience.Olesker is hard-edged and straightforward but also warmhearted in his portrayal of Baltimore's colorful characters and their settings. In a style that combines police-blotter with Sunday-feature writing, he tells brief stories that show why\u2014to visitors and residents alike\u2014Baltimore feels like home.\"Baltimore is a city of tribal rituals, of neighbors sharing steamed crabs in the back yard, and downtown waitresses who call their customers Hon without worrying about any vast sociological implications, and worshipful football fans who believe the snatching of their beloved Colts was the worst kidnapping since the Lindbergh baby.\"\u2014from Michael Olesker's Baltimore",

        "Title": "The War on Pain: How Breakthroughs in the New Field of Pain Medicine are Turning the Tide Against Suffering",
        "Authors": "By Berger, Lisa and Fishman, Scott, M.D.",
        "Description": "\"In Dr. Scott Fishman we have a model of compassion in a technological setting. . . .I feel rare confidence as I read his advice.\"--Thomas Moore, from the ForewordFor centuries, pain has been our most formidable and elusive adversary. But astounding breakthroughs in pain medicine have turned the tide in the age-old battle against suffering. In this comprehensive book, eminent pain specialist Scott Fishman, M.D., takes us to the front lines of this war, arming readers with the information--and inspiration--they need to understand and manage the full spectrum of pain: from chronic back pain to the acute discomfort of postsurgical pain, from migraines and arthritis to the suffering of terminal illness.As a physician and psychiatrist--and as the chief of a leading pain center--Dr. Fishman has a rare perspective on suffering. He understands that beyond the physical anguish, chronic pain isolates its victims while it devastates families, relationships, and careers. Too often, pain sufferers must do battle against a medical culture that is largely ill-prepared to cope with their needs. And yet, as Dr. Fishman reports, breakthroughs in neuroscience, pharmacology, and mind-body therapies have given doctors and their patients the upper hand.Through the personal journeys of real patients, we learn about the anatomy of pain and explore its pathways through the body and mind. We explore the full range of pain-fighting techniques that get results, from surgical nerve blocks to acupuncture, from common analgesics to opioids, from psychiatric drugs to cognitive behavioral therapies. As Dr. Fishman has learned from his unique clinical experience, the best chance of defeating this enemy is an integrative arsenal of traditional and \"alternative\" weapons.Writing with eloquence and compassion, Dr. Fishman offers an insider's view of how the secret language of pain is decoded and disarmed. After reading this book he hopes that you will be able to act as your own best advocate throughout the healthcare system. Dr. Fishman believes that the war on pain demands a mix of combat and diplomacy, of strategy and tactics, of carefully choosing one's battles and knowing how to step out of the crossfire. In the end, we all fight our own war on pain. And this book goes a long way toward fortifying each of us in the struggle.",

        "Description": "As the role of science and technology in everyday life grows both more pervasive and more complex, it has become ever more difficult for a scientifically \"illiterate\" public to make informed judgments. In Science, Nonscience, and Nonsense, Michael Zimmerman takes on a wide range of falsifiers, disinformation specialists, and charlatans to provide readers with the scientific background necessary to evaluate environmental and other current issues that increasingly may be a matter of life and death.Zimmerman begins by showing just what science is - and how the criteria of skepticism and falsifiability distinguish it from pseudoscience and mysticism. He offers intelligent, entertaining, and sometimes scathing analyses of bad science - from lottery \"systems\" and creationism to graphologists and homeopaths, from food and product safety scams to outright scientific fraud. In each case he shows exactly what to watch for - how the most outrageously false claims often contain a grain of truth, and how valid scientific findings may be distorted or selectively quoted to serve the ends of government, business, or special interest groups.",

Mary is nineteen and living alone in Albuquerque. Adrift in the wake of her mother's death, she longs for something meaningful to take her over. Vulnerable to love and game for anything, Mary knows she has found the other part of herself when Jose Luis enters her life.A refugee from El Salvador and its vicious and bloody civil war, Jos\u00e9 Luis has been smuggled to the United States as part of the sanctuary movement that is attempting to expose the plight of thousands of citizens being harassed, tortured, and disappeared by a United States-supported military government.Mary cannot help but fall in love with the movement and the man who represents it for her--his strength, his sadness, and the life he has left behind. And little by little, she begins to reveal to Jos\u00e9 Luis the hope that always lives in love. Though violent times conspire against Mary's dreams, she is about to lay claim to a part of herself she has never known.",

        "Description": "Who are the top ten greatest Supreme Court Justices of all time? Who are the worst ten? Which Supreme Court decision helped lead to the Civil War? What are the ten greatest and worst Supreme Court decisions? What are the ten best courtroom movies? Who was the last to use the Supreme Court spittoon? Who was the first Justice to wear trousers beneath his Supreme Court robes?From John Marshall, the greatest Supreme Court Justice, to Alfred Moore, one of the worst, Bernard Schwartz'sA Book of Legal Lists--the first ever compiled--provides the Ten Bests and Worsts in American law (and also includes answers to 150 trivia questions about the legal world). The lists include the greatest dissents and Supreme Court \"might have beens;\" greatest non-Supreme Court judges (Lemuel Shaw, number one on the Greatest list, played a prominent role in recasting common law into an American mold); greatest and worst non-Supreme Court decisions; greatest law books; lawyers (including Alexander Hamilton, Clarence Darrow \"Attorney for the Damned\", and Abraham Lincoln); trials; and greatest legal motion pictures. Each list entry has a short essay by Schwartz explaining why it is a best or a worst, and it is in these essays that we gain a wealth of information about the legal world. We learn, for instance, that Sherman Minton, number ten on the Worst Supreme Court Justices list, was such a nonentity that he may be best remembered as the last to use the spittoon provided for each Justice behind the bench. Before he became Chief Justice, William H. Rehnquist was known for playing Trivial Pursuit on the bench, Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote 873 opinions for the Court (the most in its history), and Roger Brooke Taney, number ten on the Greatest Supreme Court Justices list, was the first Chief Justice to wear trousers beneath his robes (his predecessors had always given judgment in knee breeches).Stretching back to the early 1700s, the law and the judges who interpret it have maintained a steady presence in our lives--sometimes for better, sometimes for worse. From disappointments likePlessy v. Ferguson (number two on the Ten Worst Supreme Court Decisions list), which gave the lie to the American ideal \"that all men are created equal,\" to lesser known but no less important decisions such as the 1933United States v. One Book Called \"Ulysses\", (number nine on the Ten Greatest Non-Supreme Court Decisions) the landmark First Amendment case that eased the law governing censorship, Bernard Schwartz provides legal experts and non-experts alike with entertaining information in a format that can be found nowhere else.",

It's unclear what fuels the club's Dionysian revelry, but the members are ominously insistent that Virgil join. When he declines, he is \"kidnapped\" and taken on a sensualist's tour of Britain. But is this just part of the initiation, or is he being prepared for a more primitive and sinister ritual?",

From the moment when he realizes that the musicians have to perform in a freezing cellar underneath the royal apartments, he understands that he's come to a place where the opposing states of light and dark, good and evil, are waging war to the death. Designated the king's \"Angel\" because of his good looks, he finds himself falling in love with the young woman who is the companion of the king's adulterous and estranged wife, Kirsten. With his loyalties fatally divided, how will Peter Claire find the path that will realize his hopes and save his soul?With a sure, alchemical touch and the narrative finesse that always turns her histories into a kind of magic, Rose Tremain has fashioned a rich, provocative historical romance as pungent as Denmark's salty air. This is a tale of opposites: light and darkness, tenderness and violence, music and silence.",

        "Description": "About fourteen hundred steamers, of all sizes and types, exist in Canada and the United States today. Of those, an amazing three hundred or so are still operational. Many different types of locomotive - including tiny little switchers, giant 4-8-4 Northerns, and even a huge 4-6-6-4 Challenger - are still in business, and the Union Pacific Railroad, whose legend was built by steam, never retired one of its big old locomotives, No. 844. In one way or another, many steamers remain open for business, to be inspected, enjoyed, and even ridden by railroad aficionados who refuse to let these important symbols of the past be forgotten.Writer and photographer Hans Halberstadt invites railroad devotees to climb aboard some of these venerable iron horses in Working Steam. This treasury of vintage locomotives - with information on where and how modern-day travelers can see and ride the steam trains of old - presents a unique tour of restored and active locomotives from all over North America. Illustrated with more than one hundred full-color and archival images, and peppered with fascinating first-hand accounts of life on the rails from modern-day firemen and engineers, Working Steam is a photographic gallery of the living, working remnants of a bygone age.",
