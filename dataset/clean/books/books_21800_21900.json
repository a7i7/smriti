        "Title": "Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets",
        "Authors": "By Clinton, Hillary Rodham (EDT)",
        "Description": "In a world dominated by video games, voice mail, and television, it's easy to overlook the importance of the written word. If one very important thing parents can do to help their children learn is read to them, then encouraging them to write must run a close second. What better -- and more rewarding -- way to teach a child these invaluable communication skills than through letter writing?  In her warm and engaging text, Mrs. Clinton suggests ways parents can help their children initiate and enjoy the experience of writing and receiving letters, sharing her family's (and pets') experience, and explains how letters to Socks and Buddy are received, sorted, and answered at the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home. Mrs. Clinton gives a brief \"pet history\" of the White House, from Dolley Madison's parrot and Teddy Roosevelt's children's menagerie to the Bushes' English springer spaniel Millie. She also talks about the ways Socks and Buddy participate in White House life, such as greeting guests and visiting hospitals and nursing homes. Fans of the First Pets will be delighted by a section on their vital statistics (Socks' tail length: 1 foot; Buddy's snout length: 5 inches) and answers to the questions most asked by correspondents (\"Do you have room service?\").  In Dear Socks, Dear Buddy, Mrs. Clinton also shares more than fifty letters children have sent the nation's First Pets, from a simple request for a \"paw-tograph\" to more exacting notes of good wishes (\"I want to give you a big heart, as big as the whole world\") and generous advice (\"Just because they went on a trip and didn't take you doesn't mean they don't love you any more\"). Illustrated with more than eighty photographs of Socks and Buddy on the job and at play in the White House, this book will inspire children to share their ideas and wishes through writing.",

This is Don DeLillo's second play, and it is funny, sharp, and deep-reaching. Its characters tend to have needs and desires shaped by the forces of broadcast technology.  This is the way we talk to each other today. This is the way we tell each other things, in public, before listening millions, that we don't dare to say privately.  Nothing is allowed to be unseen. Nothing remains unsaid. And everything melts repeatedly into something else, as if driven by the finger on the TV remote.  This is also a play that makes obsessive poetry out of the language of routine airline announcements and the flow of endless information.  Valparaiso has been performed by the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago.",

It chronicles these events in a connected narrative, from the onset of the illness to reflections in the years after the death. The book is, most of all, a series of acts of understanding. The poems are impelled by a passion to know, and a freedom to follow wherever the truth may lead. The book goes into area of feeling and experience rarely entered in poetry. The ebullient language, the startling, far-reaching images, the sense of extraordinary connectedness seize us immediately. Sharon Olds transforms a harsh reality with truthfulness, with beauty, with humor\u2014and without bitterness.The deep pain in The Father arises from a death, and from understanding a life. But there is joy as well. In the end, we discover we have been reading not a grim accounting but an inspiriting tragedy, transcending the personal. The radiance and daring that have always distinguished Sharon Old\u2019s work find here their most powerful expression.",

His youthful energy and boundless enthusiasm have mobilized the slumbering Sierra Club, fired the imaginations of the media and fueled a grassroots environmental movement among Gen Xers that most people would have thought impossible.  He began his activist career 15 years ago, when he organized a petition drive at school that called for the dismissal of then Secretary of the Interior James Watt. He was only eight years old. At 13, he founded the Sierra Student Coalition, a student-run adjunct to the Sierra Club that now boasts 30,000 members. Today, he is the youngest president the Sierra Club has ever had. Act First, Apologize Later\u00a0 shares Werbach's thoughts on a wide array of subjects in such chapters as Ferns and Cougars: Why We Need Nature; The California Desert Protection Act: The Anatomy of a Victory; Eco-Thugs: Profiles of Members of Congress Who Are in the Pockets of Polluters; and Solutions: Beyond \"Band-Aid\" Environmentalism.

Daniel Goleman's fascinating and persuasive book argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, ignoring a crucial range of abilities that matter immensely in terms of how we do in life.Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors add up to a different way of being smart - one he terms \"emotional intelligence.\" Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness and impulse control, persistence, zeal and self-motivation, empathy and social deftness.These are the qualities that mark people who excel in real life: whose intimate relationships flourish, who are stars in the workplace. These are also the hallmarks of character and self-discipline, of altruism and compassion - basic capacities needed if our society is to thrive.Emotional intelligence is not fixed at birth. Goleman's argument is based on a highly original synthesis of current research, including new insights into the brain architecture underlying emotion and rationality. He shows precisely how emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened in all of us. And because the emotional lessons a child learns actually sculpt the brain's circuitry, Goleman provides detailed guidance as to how parents and schools can be use this window of opportunity in childhood.",

In Your Three- and Four-Year-Old, the expert editors of Parents magazine give a fascinating peek into your child's perpetually active mind, explaining why and what your three- and four-year-old may be thinking and feeling throughout the metamorphosis from baby to miniature individual.  At the same time, you'll discover how to promote a stimulating, supportive environment in which your child can blossom.Each chapter focuses on a unique developmental milestone- from verbalizing feelings and using his imagination to learning responsibility and appreciating the needs of others. Your Three- and Four-Year-Old helps you to understand your child's evolving and often erratic behavior by sharing his perspective on the world and the people around him, and offers specific advice for easing the inevitable conflicts that arise during his quest for independence, while he's still not physically and emotionally capable of doing everything he wants to do. This essential resource also provides straightforward, practical advice on dealing with issues from imaginary friends and increasing gender awareness, to common pre-schooler fears (of darkness, dreams, and being hurt) and frustrations. Your Three- and Four-Year-Old will help you and your child to grow and enjoy these wonderful years.Each chapter highlights four main areas:* Developmental Milestone (what you can expect)* Conflict (changes in behavior that result from this milestone)* You and Your Child (how this stage of development affects you as a  parent)* Helping Your Child Grow (strategies, activities and ideas for creative play that enhance development) Informative, recurring features include: * How It Feels to Be Me (common scenarios explained from a child's perspective)* Do Say/Don't Say (scripts of appropriate responses to various situations)",

        "Description": "\"If you can put together an outfit, you're already overqualified to decorate a room,\" believes Emmy Award-winning Christopher Lowell. Now, the most popular and colorful personality on the Discovery Channel brings his proven Seven Layers of Design system to readers in a lively blend of design theory and hands-on advice for do-it-yourself projects. In this book, as on his program, Lowell brings his humor, wit, and charm to a host of decorating projects and ideas, making them simple, fun, and rewarding.Christopher Lowell's Seven Layers of Design solves decorating dilemmas by encouraging you to look at a room piece by piece, layer by layer, from the floor up. By following this process, home decorators can avoid costly disappointments and learn inexpensive tricks for changing the personality of a room. With his colorful presentation of the Seven Layers (Paint & Architecture, Installed Flooring, Upholstered Furniture, Accent Fabrics, Non-upholstered Furniture, Accessories, and Plants & Lighting), Lowell lays the groundwork for simple yet stunning home design. He demonstrates how color is the foundation of a room, why decorating a room around a favorite upholstery fabric is a recipe for disaster, how to create fabulous fakes using paint and plywood, why you should never paint a ceiling white, and how to deal with an interior designer.Each chapter of Christopher Lowell's Seven Layers of Design walks you through room makeovers with dramatic before, during, and after photos, and solves a variety of design problems. In \"Even the Kitchen Sink,\" Lowell works his magic within the constraints of existing walls and appliances, countertops, and cabinets. \"Home Office Haven\" demonstrates how to create an efficient home office and still welcome houseguests. \"Living Large\" helps you to reduce clutter by making use of space you never knew you had. \"Dining Room Drama\" shows how to bring romance into any room of the house. There are also plenty of tips, secrets, and shortcuts to tackling a stylish Deco bathroom mirror, faux-finished kitchen cabinets, a chic chaise lounge made from plywood, and more. Best of all, most of these projects can be completed for under $100.",

In Our Own Words is a record of the most impassioned, inspirational, and infuriating orations ever given by Americans in this century. Featured here are the words of poets and politicians, artists and astronauts, scoundrels and sports heroes, Native Americans and Nobel laureates, soldiers and civil rights activists, humorists and hellraisers. The most comprehensive collection of American oratory ever assembled, In Our Own Words includes over 150 speeches, sermons, eulogies, radio broadcasts, courtroom pleas, fireside chats, public tributes, and commencement addresses. Beginning on the eve of the twentieth century, this collection spans the Progressive Era, the Depression, two World Wars, the civil rights movement, McCarthyism, Vietnam, feminism, the Reagan years, and the technological revolution, bringing us right up to the threshold of the new millennium, The words of these men and women, known and unknown, challenged the conscience of this country, summoned the nation to wan brought down tyrants, paid homage to fallen heroes, gave a voice to the poor and oppressed, and energized the soul and spirit of America in its most desperate times. To hear the voices of these extraordinary Americans once again or for the first time is to sit in the front row of the history of this century, decade by decade. We find both well-known and little-known speeches by the Roosevelts and the Kennedys, Mark Twain, General George S. Patton, Ronald Reagan, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Helen Keller, Billy Graham, Malcolm X, Clarence Darrow, Rachel Carson, Will Rogers, Betty Friedan, Orson Welles, Lou Gehrig, Jane Fonda, Carl Sagan, Jackie Robinson, Charlton Heston, Pearl Buck, Vince Lombardi, Elie Wiesel, and Duke Ellington. Over a hundred more visionaries and villains, leaders and preachers, radicals and revolutionaries tell the story of their age from their bully pulpits and convention halls, their soapboxes and podiums. These are the voices of our nation. No other century could have produced such dramatic oratory. No other collection could have captured it more powerfully.",

        "Title": "The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise, and Progress",
        "Authors": "By Postrel, Virginia",
        "Description": "Today we have greater wealth, health, opportunity, and choice than at any time in history -- the fruits of human ingenuity, curiosity, and perseverance. Yet a chorus of intellectuals and politicians loudly laments our condition.Technology, they say, enslaves us. Economic change makes us insecure. Popular culture coarsens and brutalizes us. Consumerism despoils the environment. The future, they say, is dangerously out of control, and unless we rein in these forces of change and guide them closely, we risk disaster.  In The Future and Its Enemies, Virginia Postrel explodes these myths, embarking on a bold exploration of how progress really occurs. In areas of endeavor ranging from fashion to fisheries, from movies to medicine, from contact lenses to computers, she shows how and why unplanned, open-ended trial and error -- not conformity to one central vision -- is the key to human betterment. Thus, the true enemies of humanity's future are those who insist on prescribing outcomes in advance, circumventing the process of competition and experiment in favor of their own preconceptions and prejudices.  Postrel argues that these conflicting views of progress, rather than the traditional left and right, increasingly define our political and cultural debate. On one side, she identifies a collection of strange bedfellows: Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader standing shoulder to shoulder against international trade: \"right-wing\" nativists and \"left-wing\" environmentalists opposing immigration; traditionalists and technocrats denouncing Wal-Mart, biotechnology, the Internet, and suburban sprawl. Some prefer a pre-industrial past, while others envision a bureaucratically engineered future, but all share a devotion to what she calls \"stasis,\" a controlled, uniform society that changes only with permission from some central authority.  On the other side is an emerging coalition in support of what Postrel calls \"dynamism\": an open-ended society where creativity and enterprise, operating under predictable rules, generate progress in unpredictable ways. Dynamists are united not by a single political agenda out by an appreciation for such complex evolutionary processes as scientific inquiry, market competition, artistic development, and technological invention. Entrepreneurs and artists, scientists and legal theorists, cultural analysts and computer programmers, dynamists are, says Postrel \"the party of life.\"  The Future and Its Enemies is a vigorous manifesto for the dynamist worldview, as well as a penetrating analysis of how our beliefs about personal knowledge, nature, virtue, and even the relation between work and play shape the way we run our businesses, make public policy, and search for truth and beauty. Controversial and provocative, Virginia Postrel's thesis heralds a fundamental shift in the way we view politics, culture, and society as we face an unknown -- and thus invigorating -- future.",

His preparation for leaving this earth is chronicled in this surprisingly optimistic, encouraging book. Despite great suffering, Dr. Bright displayed unflinching courage and wrestled along with readers over troubling questions and intensifying his gaze on eternity. And as he experienced the nearness of death, Bright was able to write with unswerving confidence, \"Four realities are more clear than ever: God is real, His promises are true, life is an exciting though brief adventure, and heaven is our home.\"",

        "Description": "The Ransomes had been burgled. \"Robbed,\" Mrs. Ransome said. \"Burgled,\" Mr. Ransome corrected. Premises were burgled; persons were robbed. Mr. Ransome was a solicitor by profession and thought words mattered. Though \"burgled\" was the wrong word too. Burglars select; they pick; they remove one item and ignore others. There is a limit to what burglars can take: they seldom take easy chairs, for example, and even more seldom settees. These burglars did. They took everything.This swift-moving comic fable will surprise you with its concealed depths. When the sedate Ransomes return from the opera to find their Notting Hill flat stripped absolutely bare\u2014down to the toilet paper off the roll (a hard-to-find shade of forget-me-not blue)\u2014they face a dilemma: Who are they without the things they've spent a lifetime accumulating? Suddenly the world is full of unlimited and frightening possibility. But just as they begin adjusting to this giddy freedom, a newfound interest in sex, and a lack of comfy chairs, a surreal reversal of events causes them to question their assumptions yet again.The Ransomes' bafflement is the reader's delight. Alan Bennett's gentle but scathing wit, unerring ear for dialogue, and sense of the absurd makeThe Clothes They Stood Up In a memorable exploration of where in life true riches lie.",

Moving seamlessly between past and present, weaving a tale that transcends race, nationality, and religion, Zable recalls his travels by train through the Old World of his Polish/Russian emigrant parents. He enters the countryside of their remembrance, the terrain of his dreams and imagination, urged on all the while by the momentum of memory, the unsettling fragments of ancestral stories his parents told him as a child.Zable retraces the steps of the generations before him, bringing to life, as he moves among the mass graves and dead cities, the vivid and thriving communities of the 1920s and 1930s. He enters the villages of his family's past, finding the last Jews of Bialystok and Orla, stepping into the \"still life\" of a synagogue that is shattered and empty, or preserved as a museum, equally desolate, estranged from its purpose. In doing so, he comes to understand the inner lives of those who survived, siblings and parents - like his own - who escaped the hatreds of 1930s Europe only to lose, without warning, every trace of their family and former lives.The Australian publication of Jewels and Ashes generated immediate critical acclaim; the Sydney Morning Herald was not alone in suggesting that Zable belongs \"in the same company as Elie Wiesel as an interpreter of 20th-century Jewish experience.\" With writing that is exquisite, Arnold Zable articulates the haunted consciousness of the next generation of survivors.",

        "Description": "Will the Social Security system founder as millions of baby boomers enter their retirement years? Is the frightening vision of an impoverished old age a glimpse into the real future for Americans of the next generation? The authors of this book put debates about Social Security reform into historical perspective, consider various reform ideas, and elaborate a proposal to ensure that the system can continue to meet the claims of the retired and the disabled. Sylvester J. Schieber and John B. Shoven, leading experts on retirement issues, set forth a carefully considered plan to change the way we finance Social Security and thereby secure its future viability.Exploring the history of the Social Security system from its origins during the Depression to its current troubled prospects, Schieber and Shoven analyze the program\u2019s economic structure and introduce the remarkable personalities who influenced its evolution. The authors show how Social Security today differs from the program Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned and how the shift to pay-as-you-go funding has led to the system\u2019s current problems. Seen in historical context, some reform approaches are revealed as a renewal of attempts to fund Social Security through means that have repeatedly failed. The authors argue for mandatory private retirement savings accounts for workers\u2014a proposal that would lighten retirement security burdens for future generations, avoid tax increases, and preserve the system\u2019s progressivity. This book is essential reading not only for policymakers but for anyone else who wishes to understand what Social Security reform will mean for us as a nation and as individuals.",

According to certain members of the church where Robbie's father is the preacher, the end of the century might even mean the end of the world. But Robbie has more pressing worries. He's sure his father loves his simple-minded brother, Elliot, better than him, and he can no longer endure the tiresome restrictions of Christianity. He decides to leave the fold and become an \"apeist\" and, just in case the church whisperers are right, resolves to live life to the fullest. His high-spirited and often hot-headed behavior does nothing to improve his father's opinion of him, nor does it improve the congregation's flagging opinion of his father. Not until the consequences of his actions hurt others does Robbie put a stop to the snowballing chain of events he has set off and begin to realize his father might love him despite his wayward tendencies.",

Drawing on stories of people he has known as pastor, relative or friend, Arnold shows how suffering can be given meaning, and despair overcome. Interspersed with anecdotes from such wise teachers as Mother Teresa, Henri Nouwen, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Arnold's words offer the assurance that even in an age of anxiety, you can live life to the full and meet death with confidence.",
