While the eldest, Letitia, frets and the youngest, Alethea, practices her music, twins Georgina and Belle flirt and frolic their way through parties and balls and Camilla -- levelheaded and independent -- discovers what joys and sorrows the city has to offer an intelligent young woman.

In a house on the Cape \u201colder than the Republic,\u201d Robert MacIver, a historian who long ago played rugby for Scotland, creates a list of rules by which to live out his last days. The most important rule, to \u201ctell a story to its end,\u201d spurs the old Scot on to invent a strange and gripping tale of men in the trenches of the First World War. Drawn from a depth of knowledge and imagination, MacIver conjures the implacable, clear-sighted artist Private Callum; the private\u2019s nemesis Sergeant Braddis, with his pincerlike nails; Lieutenant Simon Dodds, who takes on Braddis; and Private Charlie Alston, who is ensnared in this story of inhumanity and betrayal but brings it to a close.This invented tale of the Great War prompts MacIver\u2019s own memories of his role in World War II and of Vietnam, where his son, David served. Both the stories and the memories alike are lit by the vivid presence of Margaret, his wife. As Hearts and Minds director Peter Davis writes, \u201cPouncey has wrought an almost inconceivable amount of beauty from pain, loss, and war, and I think he has been able to do this because every page is imbued with the love story at the heart of his astonishing novel.\u201dFrom the Hardcover edition.",

In this exquisite book, Steinbach searches for the answer to this question in some of the most beautiful and exciting places in the world: Paris, where she finds a soul mate; Oxford, where she takes a course on the English village; Milan, where she befriends a young woman about to be married.

This book is an introduction to this new era of ethnic challenges to world order and security.From Africa\u2019s postcolonial rebellions in the 1960s and 1970s to the anti-immigrant violence in the 1990s, Ethnic Conflict in World Politics surveys the historical, geographic, and cultural diversity of ethnopolitical conflict. Using an analytical model to elucidate four well-chosen case studies\u2014the Kurds, the Miskitos, the Chinese in Malaysia, and the Turks in Germany\u2014the authors give students tools for analyzing emerging conflicts based on the demands of nationalists, indigenous peoples, and immigrant minorities throughout the world. The international community is challenged to respond more constructively to these conflicts than it has in divided Yugoslavia, by using the emerging doctrines of peacekeeping and peacemaking that are detailed in this book.The text is liberally illustrated with maps, tables, and figures to enhance students\u2019 understanding of the quest of unfamiliar peoples for autonomy and rights, putting all into the context of international politics. An appendix surveying over fifty of the most serious ethnopolitical conflicts in the world today\u2014keyed to a global map and identifying the groups and issues as well as counting the number of lives affected\u2014shows the enormous geopolitical and cultural reach of this issue.",

        "Authors": "By Siplin, Karen V.",
        "Description": "Karen Siplin, whose first novel, His Insignificant Other, earned her critical praise from her peers and fans, presents Such a Girl -- a sexy and engaging new novel. In Such a Girl, Siplin brings to vivid life the story of a woman who ends a love affair for the \"right\" reasons, only to have a chance at beginning again years later.  Nine years ago, Kendall Stark ended a relationship with the love of her life. As her college friends never tired of telling her, Jack was going nowhere fast. Now Kendall is thirty-one, working as an operator at a prestigious New York hotel and listening in on the personal calls of the celebrity guests, while she carries on a doomed affair with a married colleague. And while deep down she knows she should be leading a more fulfilling life, Kendall believes she is content with the choices she has made.  Until the morning Jack reappears. Only now, Jack is the wealthy owner of a New England brewery, and he's staying in the hotel where Kendall works. His unexpected return leads her to rethink all the assumptions she ever made about success, love, and happiness and forces Jack to decide if he can ever forgive the woman who broke his heart so many years ago.  Just as Bridget Jones's Diary did for Pride and Prejudice, Karen Siplin here updates (and shakes up) the premise of Jane Austen's Persuasion, placing the characters in a modern, multicultural landscape. The daily intrigues of a luxury hotel provide the perfect backdrop for exploring the subtle (and overt) caste systems that still persist. Part romantic comedy, part social commentary, and imbued with the wit and contemporary urban sensibilities that Siplin displayed in her acclaimed debut, Such a Girl is an exciting and thoroughly entertaining new novel from a talent to watch.",

        "Description": "A Fable  There once was an Eagle and a Lion who had worked together on a lot of books. They did The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!, The Stinky Cheese Man, and Math Curse.  ?Everyone is waiting for Science Curse,? said their editor, Queen Bee.  ?Okay,? said Eagle Scieszka and Lion Smith. ?So why don?t we make a book of weird fables with strange morals and call is Squids Will Be Squids?  And they did.  MORAL: With these guys, you just never know.   Fables have been around for a very long time. Aesop was famous for telling them, although he wasn?t the first?or the best-looking. Now from the incomparable team who stood fairy tales on their heads with The Stinky Cheese Man, come fables as you?ve never heard them before. There?s the story of ?Little Walrus,? who tells just a little too much of the truth, and the morality tale of the boastful ?Piece of Toast and Fruit Loops.? We read of Slug, so busy admiring herself that she doesn?t see the steamroller behind her, and learn the wise lessons of ?Hand, Foot, and Tongue? (Moral: There are some things we don?t talk about at the dinner table).  In their inimitable style, Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith have created contemporary fables that reflect all the bossiness, sneakiness, bragging and silliness of our everyday lives. Of course, these tales are handled with such tact and sensitivity that we would never recognize a person like ourselves in them?would we?  Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith are an enormously popular and highly acclaimed author and illustrator team. Mr. Scieszka perfected his keen ear for juvenile humor as an elementary school teacher. He now writes full time. Mr. Smith is a filmmaker as well as a writer and illustrator. He recently designed the characters for the film version of Roald Dahl?s James and the Giant Peach.   Jon Scieszka lives in Brooklyn, New York. Lane Smith lives in New York City.",
