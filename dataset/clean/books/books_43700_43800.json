Stephen Pearse and Peter Maryk are summoned deep into the rain forests of the Congo, where a deadly virus -- set free from a centuries-old uranium cave -- has decimated a mining camp. Desperate, they bomb the area, resealing the cave containing the incurable disease. But two years later, it reappears, devastating the small New England town of Plainville.

Still, as the virus continues to elude any vaccine with a disturbingly human cunning the men seek not only to stop it but to figure out how it came from Africa. Their battle with \"Plainville\" intensifies as it becomes clear that the virus has acquired a face, having taken over a human host. And in particular, this toxic creature pursues one brave young woman whose blood, immune to the virus, is the serum of life in the face of a viral death.

This wide-ranging tour de farce is a satirical stew of such varying topical material as tabloid journalism, gun control, the Royal Family, and of course the O. J. Simpson trial.In this cracked herstorical text, George Washington doesn't chop down a cherry tree - he murders a noble representative of a voiceless, beleaguered species. In a retold \"The Devil and Daniel Webster,\" Satan is an innocent victim of fire-and-brimstone syndrome. The Louisiana Purchase almost never happens because President Thomas Jefferson faces a sexual harassment suit from Sally Hemings. The gang of outlaws at the O. K. Corral is recast as a freedom-loving private militia.",

She spends her days in the autopsy suite, the courtroom, the crime lab, with cops, and at exhumation sites. Often her long days turn into harrowing nights. It's June in Montreal, and Tempe, who has left a shaky marriage back home in North Carolina to take on the challenging assignment of director of forensic anthropology for the province of Quebec, looks forward to a relaxing weekend. First, though, she must stop at a newly uncovered burial site in the heart of the city. One look at the decomposed and decapitated corpse, stored neatly in plastic bags, tells her she'll spend the weekend in the crime lab. This is homicide of the worst kind.

For many citizens, a vote for Senator Travis Hall is also a vote for his controversial Swift and Sure Anti-Crime Bill, a measure that guarantees a previously convicted violent criminal one fair trial, one quick appeal, then immediate execution. Voters overwhelmingly support the idea, surrendering their individual rights and due process of law with a resounding \"yes\" for capital punishment.One of the most influential businessmen in the world, Harvard graduate and software prodigy Randall Armstrong, has one goal: to build a machine that can detect lies with 100 percent accuracy. But aside from assuring the guilt in death-row cases, the device has broad implications for a planet on a collision course with self-destruction.Once perfected, the Truth Machine changes the face of the world. Most lawyers find themselves looking for new, productive jobs as crime, violent behavior, and court cases are eliminated, virtually overnight. Individuals are truth-tested for civil litigation and mediation. Political candidates must be perfectly frank, no longer relying on popular opinion polls or harboring hidden agendas. Refusal to submit to the Truth Machine brands a politician un-electable. Through a series of simple questions, the Truth Machine can diagnose mental illness with astonishing success.As its use spreads from courtroom to politics, to diplomacy, business, science, education, and finally into every home throughout the world, the Truth Machine reshapes the very nature of humanity. But ultimately, the fate of the earth rests with humankind. Are we up to the challenge?",

        "Description": "Until now, the relationship between a company and its customers or suppliers has consisted of arms-length haggling over the price of a part or a service. Today, reveals alliance expert Jordan D. Lewis, customers and suppliers are actually embracing each other?sharing data, design work, and even research and development. The result, Lewis finds, has been a dramatic improvement in each firm's costs, quality, cycle times, and customer satisfaction?without added expense. Building on his groundbreaking work, Partnerships for Profit, Lewis shows managers how to maximize the potential of these new customer-supplier alliances?described by the Wall Street Journal as a \"revolution\"?by drawing upon his hands-on experience and research with best-practicefirmsworldwidesuchas Motorola, Chrysler, and Marks & Spencer.  Although more and more firms now recognize the importance of customer-supplier alliances, few actually know how to make them work. Using interviews with employees ranging from top executives to purchasing and sales people, Lewis takes the reader inside these leading-edge companies and their top suppliers to show precisely how the \"connected\" corporation can double its competitive resources by forging customer-supplier relationships for greater financial strength, higher market share, more value, and increased operating flexibility.  Lewis provides the tools managers need to structure and manage effective and successful alliances. He discusses all of the initial questions on how to get started?when to use alliances, how to choose the best partners, and how to set clear objectives targeted on high performance. Specific techniques are presented to foster joint creativity?from building interfirm teams to systems-based thinking?as well as methods for monitoring alliance performance and progress. Lewis also shows ways to develop the foundation of cooperation, negotiation, and trust between partners which is so crucial in achieving optimum competitive advantage.  By capitalizing on the new customer-supplier alliances, any firm can increase its competitiveness regardless of industry, company size, or whether its focus is on goods or services. Lewis provides managers of all types with the framework they need to avoid the pitfalls and enjoy the full benefits of the connected corporation.",

As death approaches, life takes on, for some of these aging heroes, a translucence, a magical fragility; vivid memory and casual misconception lend the mundane an antic texture, and the backward view, lengthening, acquires a certain grandeur. Travel, whether to England or Ireland, Italy or the isles of Greece, heightens perceptions and tensions. As is usual in Mr. Updike\u2019s fiction, spouses quarrel, lovers part, children are brave, and houses with their d\u00e9cor have the presence of personalities. His is a world where innocence stubbornly persists, and fresh beginnings almost outnumber losses.",

        "Authors": "By Marr, John S. and Baldwin, John",
        "Description": "What if the ten plagues from the Book of Exodus were coming true in America today? What if they were not acts of God but the brilliantly fiendish creations of an evil genius? In this galvanizing novel of medical terror, death stalks the land, and the only hope of preventing a cataclysm beyond biblical proportions lies with one maverick virologist who is himself in danger of becoming either a suspect or a victim.  In present-day Southern California, two children die of a disease thought to be nonexistent in the United States. Within hours, Thoroughbreds at the legendary Churchill Downs are dying of a virus that cannot be identified, even by the most expert veterinarians. Called in to help shed light on  these gruesome enigmas, noted virologist Jack  Bryne discovers that the two events are not only connected, they are deliberate acts of bioterrorism.  When it occurs to him that the deaths bear uncanny similarities to the Fifth and Sixth Plagues described in Exodus, Bryne is convinced he&#39;s uncovered a growing progression of horrors. He&#39;s right, and every month another monstrosity claims its victims. Every month sees the reenactment of another even more catastrophic plague.  Soon Bryne&#39;s worldwide medical computer network, ProMED, is invaded by the power behind the horrors, teasing him, challenging him--a morbidly brilliant serial killer with a dangerously sophisticated knowledge of toxins and an obsession with biblical  retribution. Bryne, himself now considered a suspect by the FBI, must convince the Bureau of his innocence and joins forces with his brilliant lab assistant, a TV newswoman, and a young Orthodox Jewish religious scholar--to track down the maniac and stop him in time.  But even Bryne cannot predict how close the killer is until he meets this modern medical Moriarty in a midnight confrontation that will determine the future of New York City.  Written by one of this country&#39;s most respected public health figures, and a novelist with a genius for the macabre, The Eleventh Plague is scientifically prescient and utterly compelling. It&#39;s a premier thriller for the millennium--bound to leave you with the disturbing realization that the real terror begins once the last page has been turned.  The biblical plagues were acts of God, this time they are man-made  Waters of Blood Frogs Lice Swarms  Death of the Animals  Boils  Hailstorms  Locusts  Darkness  Destruction of the Firstborns  And the worst is yet to come...The Eleventh Plague--you will never feel safe again.",

They are eager for change, and McCain's independence and his vigorous leadership have inspired them.  Granted unique access to the Senator and his closest aides, prizewinning journalist Elizabeth Drew offers a close-up, fascinating account of Senator McCain as he goes about the legislative business of achieving campaign finance reform, his signature issue, building coalitions, and working across party lines. As she shows him in action, McCain is revealed as a shrewd and long-sighted strategist, someone who works with his colleagues far more successfully than his image might suggest. We see this original mind at work and get new insights into his complex personality.  Drew also shows how McCain has broadened his agenda, putting him at a pivotal place in American political life.  In this riveting narrative, replete with McCain's unusual candor, and his unorthodox ways, we see how this war hero turned political leader is showing the public -- and cynical Washington insiders -- that there are other ways to go about working for the public",

        "Title": "Cooking with Grease: Stirring the Pots in American Politics",
        "Authors": "By Brazile, Donna",
        "Description": "Cooking with Grease is a powerful, behind-the-scenes memoir of the life and times of a tenacious political organizer and the first African-American woman to head a major presidential campaign.  Donna Brazile fought her first political fight at age nine -- campaigning (successfully) for a city council candidate who promised a playground in her neighborhood. The day after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, she committed her heart and her future to political and social activism. By the 2000 presidential election, Brazile had become a major player in American political history -- and she remains one of the most outspoken and forceful political activists of our day.  Donna grew up one of nine children in a working-poor family in New Orleans, a place where talking politics comes as naturally as stirring a pot of seafood gumbo -- and where the two often go hand in hand. Growing up, Donna learned how to cook from watching her mother, Jean, stir the pots in their family kitchen. She inherited her love of reading and politics from her grandmother Frances. Her brothers Teddy Man and Chet worked as foot soldiers in her early business schemes and voter registration efforts.  Cooking with Grease follows Donna's rise to greater and greater political and personal accomplishments: lobbying for student financial aide, organizing demonstrations to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday and working on the Jesse Jackson, Dick Gephardt, Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton presidential campaigns. But each new career success came with its own kind of heartache, especially in her greatest challenge: leading Al Gore's 2000 campaign, making her the first African American to lead a major presidential campaign.  Cooking with Grease is an intimate account of Donna's thirty years in politics. Her stories of the leaders and activists who have helped shape America's future are both inspiring and memorable. Donna's witty style and innovative political strategies have garnered her the respect and admiration of colleagues and adversaries alike -- she is as comfortable trading quips with J. C. Watts as she is with her Democratic colleagues. Her story is as warm and nourishing as a bowl of Brazile family gumbo.",

Ninety-nine days later, six half-starved wretches came ashore near Callville, Arizona.Lewis and Clark opened the West in 1803, six decades later Powell and his scruffy band aimed to resolve the West\u2019s last mystery.

The symptoms are devastating: sudden unprovoked attacks of anxiety-accompanied by skipping and racing of the heart, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizzy spells. Even worse is the fear that you are losing your mind. But here's the good news. The more unexpected and unprovoked the attacks or the symptoms, the more likely that the victim is suffering from a biologically beset disease. What's more, medical science can now overcome this disease in virtually all cases through a combination of drugs and behavior therapy. Dr. David V. Sheenan, formerly of the Havard Medical School, is now the Director of Research of the College of Medicine at the University of South Florida in Tampa. He draws upon recent research and his own pioneering breakthroughs in the treatment of anxiety to present in this book: -Quizzes that will help you determine whether your anxiety is caused by normal stress or is the result of a genetically influenced physical disorder. Seven progressive stages of the disease-and the four steps necessary for recovery. Detailed case histories of former anxiety victims who are now leading full and productive lives. Reassurance and guidance to family members and friends who want to help, but don't know how. This book offers new hope to millions of men and women across the country.",

No matter how far you are on the parenting road, Hutchcraft can show you how to make the most of the days you have left with your children. Five Needs Your Child Must Have Met at Home details the five critical needs of every child: the need for a secure self, honest sexual answers, satisfying love, stable authority, and spiritual reality. You'll learn: how to identify and affirm your children's strengths, how to look beyond you children's deeds to meet their needs, and how to raise children of integrity.",

(He dips into the cuisines of the American Southwest, Latin America, Asia, and the Mediterranean for inspiration.) Hayot has forged a style out of blending wildly different ingredients and influences. But the exotic appeal of his cooking is balanced by its hominess. At the Authentic Cafe, there are no difficult techniques. Whatever its origins, Hayot's food is always comforting. In fact, some of his dishes are family recipes, from his Moroccan grandmother's kitchen.Dinner at the Authentic Cafe brings home more than 130 of the recipes that have made the little restaurant a whopping success. In recipe introductions, special features, and a glossary, Hayot explains the uses and availability of his ethnic ingredients, dishes, and utensils, and he includes a source list for special ingredients, too. The book is illustrated throughout with the author's own photographs taken in his wide-ranging travels, in L.A.'s ethnic neighborhoods, and at his restaurant. Dinner at the Authentic Cafe takes you to the sources of a chef's fusion style.",

Now, with the help of her home girl Chunichi, and right hand man Roy Glenn, she\u2019s about to take street fiction to a place it\u2019s never been before, as they introduce Unique, Nina, and Anyeh, three of the baddest girls from the hood you ever want to meet.  For Unique, life is good until her dope-dealing boyfriend, Took, is arrested and winds up in jail. Now she\u2019s broke as a joke; trying to put every petty hustle into play to chase hard times away from the door. With an empty refrigerator, a stack of bills pilling up, a tenth grade education, a big butt and a smile, it doesn\u2019t take long for her to learn to pull the wool over the eyes of any fool who\u2019s blinded by her good looks. She\u2019s sure that one day some guy\u2019s slip-up will be her ultimate come-up, and her days of nickel and dime swindles will be a thing of the past. Unique knows that every scandalous chick has her day, but doesn\u2019t realize that her day will come too! If luck were money, Nina Thomas would be one broke sister. After taking a stab at stripping, she finds herself once again on the wrong end of a bad choice. Now she\u2019s on trial for murder, and the consequences of spending too much time with the wrong folks might just end up costing her life. Anyeh is out for revenge, and with the help of a secret friend on the other end of her cell phone, known only as \u201cmy baby,\u201d she just might get what she wants. She\u2019s after Diablo, the most well-known hustler in Virginia. He\u2019s one careful brother; but in the end, his feelings for Anyeh might just be his undoing.",

Fans who flocked to her stories will be captivated by her best-selling first novel, now in paperback for the first time. The Namesake is a finely wrought, deeply moving family drama that illuminates this acclaimed author's signature themes: the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, the tangled ties between generations.The Namesake takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of an arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Ashoke does his best to adapt while his wife pines for home. When their son, Gogol, is born, the task of naming him betrays their hope of respecting old ways in a new world. And we watch as Gogol stumbles along the first-generation path, strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs.With empathy and penetrating insight, Lahiri explores the expectations bestowed on us by our parents and the means by which we come to define who we are.",

        "Title": "Imperial Grunts: The American Military on the Ground",
        "Authors": "By Kaplan, Robert D.",
        "Description": "In this landmark book, Robert D. Kaplan, veteran correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly and author of Balkan Ghosts, shows how American imperialism and the Global War on Terrorism are implemented on the ground, mission by mission, in the most exotic landscapes around the world. Given unprecedented access, Kaplan takes us from the jungles of the southern Philippines to the glacial dust bowls of Mongolia, from the forts of Afghanistan to the forests of South America\u2013not to mention Iraq\u2013to show us Army Special Forces, Marines, and other uniformed Americans carrying out the many facets of U.S. foreign policy: negotiating with tribal factions, storming terrorist redoubts, performing humanitarian missions and training foreign soldiers. In Imperial Grunts, Kaplan provides an unforgettable insider\u2019s account not only of our current involvement in world affairs, but also of where America, including the culture of its officers and enlisted men, is headed. This is the rare book that has the potential to change the way readers view the men and women of the military, war, and the global reach of American imperialism today.As Kaplan writes, the only way to understand America\u2019s military is \u201con foot, or in a Humvee, with the troops themselves, for even as elites in New York and Washington debated imperialism in grand, historical terms, individual marines, soldiers, airmen, and sailors\u2013all the cultural repositories of America\u2019s unique experience with freedom\u2013were interpreting policy on their own, on the ground, in dozens upon dozens of countries every week, oblivious to such faraway discussions. . . . It was their stories I wanted to tell: from the ground up, at the point of contact.\u201dNever before has America\u2019s overarching military strategy been parsed so incisively and evocatively. Kaplan introduces us to lone American servicemen whose presence in obscure countries is largely unknown, and concludes with a heart-stopping portrait of marines in the first battle in Fallujah. Extraordinary in its scope, beautifully written, Imperial Grunts, the first of two volumes, combines first-rate reporting with the sensitivity and insights of an acclaimed writer steeped in history, literature, and philosophy, to deliver a masterly account of America\u2019s global role in the twenty-first century. \u2022 Imperial Grunts paints a vivid picture of how defense policy is implemented at the grassroots level.\u2022 Kaplan travels throughout the world where U.S. forces are located. This is not just a book about Iraq or Afghanistan. \u2022 Rather than debate imperialism, Kaplan relies on a keen understanding of history, philosophy, and in-the-field reporting to show how it actually works on the ground.\u2022 Imperial Grunts escapes Washington and shows us what it\u2019s like to live with the grunts day to day.Praise for Imperial Grunts\u201cOne of the most important books of the last several years. Robert Kaplan uses his prodigious energy and matchless reporting skills to takes us on to the front lines with the new warrior-diplomats who use weapons, imagination, and personal passion to protect and advance the interests of the United States. This is a generation every American should come to know.\u201d\u2013Tom Brokaw\u201cRobert Kaplan has brilliantly captured the story of today\u2019s U.S. military operating in far-flung places on strange missions. Imperial Grunts is the most insightful and superbly written account of soldiering in the New World Disorder to date. It is a must read for all Americans.\u201d\u2013General Anthony C. Zinni, United States Marine Corps (Ret.)\u201cKaplan infuses us with a sense of hope about the future. Through astonishing observations, truths, and stories, Imperial Grunts introduces a brand-new way of thinking about the enduring virtue of the American spirit.\u201d\u2013George Crile, author of Charlie Wilson\u2019s War\u201cNo recent book so well or so vividly portrays the challenges of the modern United States military. With an impressive grasp of the complexities of military missions worldwide, Robert Kaplan exposes the reader to the world of the modern soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine. A must read for both civilian and military leaders.\u201d\u2013General Barry R. McCaffrey, United States Army (Ret.), Bradley Distinguished Professor of International Security Studies, United States Military Academy\u201cImperial Grunts is vintage Robert Kaplan, combining a deep appreciation of history and wonderfully vivid writing with an infectious wanderlust.\u201d\u2013Max Boot, Senior Fellow, National Security Studies, the Council on Foreign Relations, author of The Savage Wars of Peace\u201cSplendid! This is the finest work in print about today\u2019s American fighting men and the challenges they face around the globe. Kaplan\u2019s courage in researching this book under combat conditions is complemented by his integrity and great literary skill. Imperial Grunts simply could not be better.\u201d\u2013Ralph Peters, author of Beyond Baghdad",

        "Title": "Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present",
        "Authors": "By Oren, Michael B.",
        "Description": "Beset by privateers and bereft of protection by the British navy, the newly founded USA had a pressing interest in diplomacy with Algeria and other havens for pirates. Slightly later the new nation, its self-confidence greatly grown, provided a steady stream of Orientalists and missionaries seeking documents, relics, and souls to save. Oren (history, Shalem Center) points out that American involvement in the Middle East started at the moment there was an America. He details the various people who sought to explore the Middle East, exploit it, explain it to the folks back home, make it into America's image, and save it from itself. He explains the rampant fantasies about the Holy Land, the piety mixed freely with imperialism, the movements founded in America that helped to shape the destiny of Israel, and the fact that oil is a relatively new element.

        "Title": "The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth from 9/11 to Katrina",
        "Authors": "By Rich, Frank",
        "Description": "When America was attacked on 9/11, its citizens almost unanimously rallied behind its new, untested president as he went to war. What they didn't know at the time was that the Bush administration's highest priority was not to vanquish Al Qaeda but to consolidate its own power at any cost. It was a mission that could be accomplished only by a propaganda presidency in which reality was steadily replaced by a scenario of the White House's own invention\u2014and such was that scenario's devious brilliance that it fashioned a second war against an enemy that did not attack America on 9/11, intimidated the Democrats into incoherence and impotence, and turned a presidential election into an irrelevant referendum on macho imagery and same-sex marriage.   As only he can, acclaimed New York Times columnist Frank Rich delivers a step-by-step chronicle of how skillfully the White House built its house of cards and how the institutions that should have exposed these fictions, the mainstream news media, were too often left powerless by the administration's relentless attack machine, their own post-9/11 timidity, and an unending parade of self-inflicted scandals (typified by those at The New York Times). Demonstrating the candor and conviction that have made him one of our most trusted and incisive public voices, Rich brilliantly and meticulously illuminates the White House's disturbing love affair with \"truthiness,\" and the ways in which a bungled war, a seemingly obscure Washington leak, and a devastating hurricane at long last revealed the man-behind-the-curtain and the story that had so effectively been sold to the nation, as god-given patriotic fact.",
