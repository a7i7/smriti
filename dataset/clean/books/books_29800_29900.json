        "Description": "A survivor of childhood trauma, two marriages, twenty hard years with the Seattle Police Department, and the bottle, Jonas Piedmont Beaumont has spent far too much time trolling the darker waters of human nature. In the wake of a devastating professional tragedy, he has decided, at long last, to pull the pin. But there is no safety in semiretirement for a man who, long ago, chose to make a violent world his home.Temporarily at leisure, Beau has agreed to chaperon his newly wed grandmother on her honeymoon cruise to the Gulf of Alaska. His time aboard the Starfire Breeze is meant to be an enjoyable diversion, a respite to allow some deep psychological wounds a chance to heal in the bright sun and clear, crisp northern sea air. It also places him squarely in the sights of a feisty group of middle-aged divorc&eacutees.But death is everywhere, even at sea. Beau's brief idyll is abruptly shaken when one of his new admirers, mysteriously disappears -- and is shattered when a security videotape shows her taking a fatal fall overboard. Like it or not, the burden of investigating a heinous crime is once again on Beau's shoulders. And this one is carrying the seasoned detective into uncommonly dark and dangerous waters. Adrift a thousand miles from home, J. P. Beaumont suddenly finds himself submerged in a terrifying conspiracy that, if allowed to proceed unchecked, could have disastrous consequences, not only for Beau and his shipmates, but for the future of the world they all hope to return to.In Birds of Prey, J. A. Jance masterfully demonstrates her rare and winning ability to combine riveting suspense, intelligence, vivid color, and poignant humanity into one magnificent whole. No one in her field is better at exploring mortal strengths and frailties while exposing the complex shades of evil that can shroud the human soul.",

John Finney counted his steps as he fought his way for help from inside a Seattle warehouse burning on Leary Way. And when he reached his rescuers, he told them where his partner lay waiting\u2013twenty-eight paces away. But they didn\u2019t reach Finney\u2019s partner until the building had cooled.

But Finney doesn\u2019t believe the fire was an accident. And he doesn\u2019t believe the campaign against him is one either.Trying to reconstruct the events at Leary Way, Finney uncovers suspicious actions by men at the scene. With only one person on his side\u2013a female firefighter who is herself an outcast in the department\u2013Finney begins to piece together an astounding conspiracy that will turn friends into suspects, good men into conspirators, and every man inside the department into a potentially deadly enemy.

In Vertical Burn he fuses his feeling for real-life heroes with a white-hot tale of suspense and betrayal\u2013 the kind of betrayal that burns bodies, burns a city, and burns a soul forever.",

With her emotions sandblasted and her reactions slowed, she fails to recognize the peril that surrounds her as the case takes a violent twist.From Rogers empty apartment to an eerie abandoned resort on the San Francisco waterfront, McCone is caught in a deadly battle to uncover the truth. And to survive, she must confront the many painful secrets of her own life ... and a killer whose heart is as black as the moonless bay.",

Why had he climbed this mountain sacred to Navajos and why had he been killed there - or, even worse, left to die a lonely death?The fallen man lay sprawled on a ledge under the peak of Ship Rock mountain for eleven years - visited only by the ravens that had picked his bones clean and scattered his rock-climbing gear. That peaceful period ended, appropriately, on Halloween, when a climbing party stumbled upon his bones and began a chain of events that would ultimately link Leaphorn and Chee.As Chee and Leaphorn join to investigate why the fallen man fell, they set off across the high desert landscape of the Navajo reservation and into the lives of a rookie cop who is smarter than anyone thinks, a lonely woman who takes up her father's hobby of watching a mountain, a cattle-brand inspector who demonstrates that cows are even more curious than cats, a banker who knows her depositors' private lives as well as their balance sheets, a widow who loves one man too many, and the people who defy death on the towering cliffs of a sacred peak.",

Peter Decker, is also rocked by this outrage, which cuts close to the spiritual heart of his family, but he can't let his emotions get in the way of his duties.A suspect is soon in custody. Seventeen-year-old Ernesto Golding is one of L.A.'s children of wealth and privilege, a rich kid obsessed with haunting suspicions about the origins of his Polish paternal grandfather, who moved to Argentina after the Third Reich collapsed. Charges are brought against Ernesto, a deal is cut, and the vandalism case is eventually closed.Still, Decker has never abandoned the possibility that others were involved in the desecration. And his hunch is confirmed when, six months later, Ernesto is found brutally murdered along with his therapist, Dr. Mervin Baldwin, at the psychologist's exclusive nature camp that caters to the wealthy's troubled children. Suspicion falls immediately on Baldwin's psychologist wife, Dee, who has vanished mysteriously. Further probing by Decker fails to produce quick answers and simple solutions. For Decker and Rina, unraveling the truth behind Ernesto's violent death becomes more terrifying with each sinister twist, pushing them into the ghastly world of ruthless parents and damaged youths. Slowly, lethal secrets with roots in the horrors of a past generation surface, propelling Peter and Rina into a dreaded journey of dark and evil -- and of ultimate retribution.",

        "Description": "Harold Coyle has established himself as one of America's finest suspense novelists. With four consecutive New York Times best-selling novels of epic war, Team Yankee, Sword Point, Bright Star, and Trial by Fire, he is a master of the supercharged merging of global conflicts, strategy, politics, and probable world events. The Ten Thousand represents Harold Coyle at his visionary and apocalyptic best, and it's as intense, startling and thrilling as it is suspenseful.Hard on the heels of revolution and hope, Europe is suddenly in flames again. Germany is once more the dominant power, her leadership determined to win the world's respect, by bloody force if necessary. In Eastern Europe, where a weakened Russia is struggling against the ambitions of her neighbors, virulent nationalism and ancient ethnic hatreds fan the flames of war, this time with nuclear weapons as the ultimate threat. Caught up in the rising storm of a Europe in dangerous transition is an American army, no longer just keeping the peace, but drawn inexorably into a real shooting war.Harold Coyle's riveting - and all too possibly prophetic - new novel has the immediacy and the punch of today's fears and tomorrow's headlines. When the Ukraine refuses to hand its store of nuclear weapons to Russia, American troops are sent in to enforce compliance, while a right-wing nationalist German government seizes the opportunity to make a bid for world power....Trapped by the rush of events, threatened by the specter-become-reality of a united Germany with atomic weapons, the American forces make a bold bid for survival by fighting their way to the safety of the Baltic Sea, crossing a hostile Germany like the Greeks in Xenophon's classic \"The Ten Thousand.\"Coyle's grasp of geopolitical reality and his sure command of the battlefield - in the words of Stephen Coonts, \"Nobody knows war like Harold Coyle, and nobody writes it better! \" - is matched by the skill with which he creates and maneuvers a rich and fascinating cast of characters, from the top decision makers - the President of the United States, the Chancellor of Germany, their advisors and staffs - down to the ordinary soldiers and civilians obliged to live or die as a consequence of those decisions.The story of Lieutenant General \"Big Al\" Malin's epic march through Germany to the sea pits Americans against Germans for the first time in fifty years, plunging into battle Colonel Scott Dixon (the ongoing central figure in Coyle's novels); Captain Nancy Kozak, the engaging young female combat officer from Trial by Fire; and Colonel Vorishnov and Major Ilvanich, two Russian officers who find themselves fighting side by side with the Americans; as well as countless soldiers and officers on both sides, facing combat - and their consciences - for the first time.Exciting, frighteningly plausible, absolutely authentic, The Ten Thousand is Harold Coyle's most ambitious and explosive book to date.",

        "Description": "Mary Higgins Clark, America's \"Queen of Suspense,\" delves into the mystery of psychic powers and communication with the dead in her gripping new thriller,  Before I Say Good-Bye.  When Adam Cauliff's new cabin cruiser, Cornelia II, blows up in New York harbor with him and several close business associates aboard, his wife, Nell MacDermott, is not only distraught at the loss but wracked with guilt because she and Adam had just had a serious quarrel and she had told him not to come home.  The quarrel was precipitated by Nell's decision to try to win the congressional seat long held by her grandfather Cornelius MacDermott. Orphaned at age ten, she had been raised by \"Mac,\" as she called him, and was always at his side on Capitol Hill. Politics was in her blood, and Adam had known her ambitions when they married. Suddenly, however, he became opposed to her plan to run for Congress.  Nell, like her great-aunt Gert, possesses psychic gifts, which her grandfather scoffingly dismisses as \"flights of fantasy.\" As a child she had been aware of the deaths of both her parents and grandmother at the exact moment they died. She knew because at that very moment she sensed their presence near her. Even though Nell has the rare gift of extrasensory perception, she is much too levelheaded to accept most of the claims made by many so-called psychics and is skeptical about Aunt Gert's fascination with mediums. After Adam's death, however, Gert begs Nell to see a medium, Bonnie Wilson, who has contacted her, claiming she is in touch with Adam. Still regretting her last angry words to Adam, Nell agrees, hoping that she will be able to reach him through the medium and part from him in peace.  As the investigation into the boat's explosion proceeds, Nell is shocked by the official confirmation that it was not an accident but the result of foul play. Adam, an architect, had been involved in a major construction project on land he had recently purchased and which had since had a spectacular rise in value.  Was Adam the target of the explosion? Or was it Winifred Johnson, his self-effacing, fifty-two-year-old assistant, who knew too much about bribery in the construction business and who was openly in love with him? Or was it Sam Krause, a builder with a questionable reputation who was involved in the new project? Or Jimmy Ryan, the debt-ridden construction foreman whose wife, after his death, discovers money hidden in their home? Or was it Peter Lang, the wealthy man-about-town real-estate entrepreneur, whose minor traffic accident caused him to miss the fatal meeting on the boat?  As Nell searches for the truth about Adam's death, she carries out instructions from Adam transmitted through the medium. What she does not know is that she is being closely watched, and the nearer she comes to learning what actually happened on the boat that night, the nearer she is to becoming the next victim of a ruthless killer.",

        "Authors": "By Buckley, Fiona",
        "Description": "With historical mysteries and tales of Tudor England in high demand, acclaimed author Fiona Buckley returns with a poignant new novel featuring Ursula Blanchard, waiting woman and secret agent for Queen Elizabeth I.  Still loyal to her royal mistress but needing to be with her French husband, Matthew de la Roche, Ursula begins to build a new life for herself at Matthew's ch\u00e2teau. She loves Matthew, although she longs desperately for her little girl, Meg, left behind in England. But when Meg's passage is finally arranged, the child is missing. Where is she, and could her disappearance be part of a plot to tempt Ursula back to her homeland?  Frightened for her child, Ursula follows a trail that leads to the home of the ancient Mortimer family, the mysterious Vetch Castle, a grim, haunted keep on the Welsh border. There she finds castle owner Philip Mortimer, who boasts that he will force Queen Elizabeth to restore the fortunes of his once-great family. There, too, Ursula finds Philip's mother, the aging but still beautiful Lady Thomasine, who is frightened by her son's claims and pleads for Ursula's help in discovering what it is that he knows. What deadly secrets does this castle hide? What ghostly faces look from the windows of the deserted southwest tower? What has Philip Mortimer discovered? The secrets of Vetch Castle could be dangerous, especially if they concern the Queen -- dangerous to the Mortimers and to Ursula and those she loves, as she soon learns to her peril.  Richly evocative of its rugged English and Welsh setting, precise in its historical detail, and filled with memorable characters, To Ruin a Queen will affirm Fiona Buckley's growing reputation as a queen of historical crime.",

It's songwriters' night at the Sutler, a chance to serve up her big, bluesy voice to a crowd hungry for new country songs. Shelby's picturing herself onstage, a girl from Star, Mississippi, belting one clear against the back wall, when a familiar head of golden hair brings her out of her reverie.She'd know Leroy Mabry's puny frame from a mile away - and the last time she'd seen it was in divorce court. Though she wonders what the devil he's up to, she's got better things to think about. But back home, changing out of her work clothes, she's shocked to discover Leroy's idea of a calling card nestled among her lingerie. Momma always said her scream was a snake-strangler.Jeff Wayne Capshew, Metro Police patrolman for ten years, knows these stalking things can get serious fast. He's done all he can do for Shelby, but he can't shake her image from his mind ... her thick, wild, red-brown hair, her creamy valentine face. He feels compelled to protect her - and his instincts are right on. Leroy's been hitting the bourbon and soon shows up at Shelby's to convince her to come on home. When she flat out refuses, he begins to lose it.While Leroy sobers up in a cellblock, Shelby puts the pedal to the metal - aiming for her true heart's desire. The rest of her life takes the backseat, so there's no way for her to see what's coming. Leroy, fueled by his pent-up anger and fast-talking cellmate, gets out on bail and goes after her again; Jeff crosses her path a few too many times, going well beyond the call of duty; an eclectic mix of jealous women, scouting agents, and a big-name star ready for a big-time comeback make their own plans for Thursday night at the Sutler. Shelby's ready for a high-voltage evening but, blinded by her vision of bright lights and hot crowds, she's headed down a dangerous collision course.",

Now the series hits a new landmark with the first original hardcover to chronicle the adventures of Captain Mackenzie Calhoun and the valiant crew of the U.S.S. Excalibur. But the latest chapter begins with the future of Calhoun and his mission very much in doubt....  The Excalibur has been destroyed, the victim of insidious sabotage. Last seen on board only moments before it was blown to bits, Captain Mackenzie Calhoun was assumed lost with his ship. Now First Officer Elizabeth Shelby has been granted a command of her own, the U.S.S. Exeter, where she will discover exactly what kind of a captain she is meant to become.  But what about Calhoun? Unbeknownst to Starfleet, the resourceful Xenexian officer escaped the cataclysmic demise of the Excalibur, only to end up marooned on the primitive outback world of Yakaba. There he eventually befriends Shula, a woman with the strange and inexplicable ability to summon rain for her parched and struggling frontier community.  Shula's powers, however, have made her the target of jealous and avaricious enemies. They will stop at nothing to seize control of her special gifts -- or destroy them forever. Trapped on a hostile world, unable to contact Starfleet or even let Shelby and the others know he is still alive, Calhoun is drawn into a life-or-death struggle against relentless foes.  Full of unexpected twists and surprises as only Peter David can devise them, Restoration is a major turning point in the ongoing saga of Star Trek\u00ae: New Frontier.",

I've come to see it very much as an ongoing process that never stops.  For many people, the faith they grew up with loses its meaning during adolescence.  Others who never had any faith in childhood begin exploring religion for the first time in adolescence or young adulthood.  I've come to realize that there are identifiable stages of spiritual development that people go through, no matter what their religious tradition is or isn't.  Just as we grow emotionally and intellectually over the years, so we grow spiritually, if we allow ourselves.-- from the bookTufts University Chaplain Scotty McLennan (the inspiration for Doonesbury's Reverend Scot Sloan) offers an indispensable guidebook to those seeking a new spiritual path or wishing to reconnect to the religion of their youth.  He reassures anyone at a spiritual crossroads--those who have become disillusioned with or even abandoned the religion of their youth--that finding a relevant and fulfilling spirituality is a process of understanding one's place in any of six universal stages of faith: Magic, Reality, Dependence, Independence, Interdependence, and Unity.  He offers signposts and checklists for determining where readers are own their own spiritual journey, and for helping them grow and develop.  By recognizing a progression of steps toward a faith of one's own choosing, McLennan explains, one can more fully open one's soul to its spiritual destiny.",

The first fictional memoir ever written by a black, The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man influenced a generation of writers during the Harlem Renaissance and served as eloquent inspiration for Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, and Richard Wright. In the 1920s and since, it has also given white readers a startling new perspective on their own culture, revealing to many the double standard of racial identity imposed on black Americans.Narrated by a mulatto man whose light skin allows him to \"pass\" for white, the novel describes a pilgrimage through America's color lines at the turn of the century--from a black college in Jacksonville to an elite New York nightclub, from the rural South to the white suburbs of the Northeast. This is a powerful, unsentimental examination of race in America, a hymn to the anguish of forging an identity in a nation obsessed with color. And, as Arna Bontemps pointed out decades ago, \"the problems of the artist [as presented here] seem as contemporary as if the book had been written this year.\"",

His collection, which he has protected and enlarged through both World War II and Czechoslovakia's years of Stalinism, numbers more than 1,000 pieces, all crammed into his two-room Prague flat.Utz is allowed to leave the country each year, and although he has considered defection, he always returns. He cannot take his precious collection with him, but he cannot leave it, either. And so Utz is as much owned by his porcelain as it is owned by him, as much of a prisoner of the collection as of the Communist state.A fascinating, enigmatic man, Kaspar Utz is one of Bruce Chatwin's finest creations. And his story, as delicately cast as one of Utz's porcelain figures, is unforgettable.",

It comprises more than 150 selections, including stories, sketches, essays, poems, memoirs, and blues and C&W lyrics, arranged under such headings as \"My People, My People (How's Your Mama 'n Them?),\" \"Here Be Dragons, or, How Come These Butterbeans Have an Alligator Taste?\" and \"Lying and Other Forms of Communication.\" The wildly heterogeneous roster of contributors range from such classics as William Faulkner, Mark Twain, Flannery O'Connor, Zora Neale Hurston, and Eudora Welty to such brilliantly funny contemporaries as Molly Ivins, Dave Barry, Harry Crews, Ishmael Reed, Barry Hannah, Bailey White, and Roy Blount, Jr., his very own self.If you could stop laughing long enough you'd probably call Roy Blount's Book of Southern Humor a classic.

        "Description": "With the publication of her first novel, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its compassionate glimpses into its characters&#39; inner lives, the novel is considered McCullers&#39; finest work, an enduring masterpiece first published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small town life. When Singer&#39;s mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book&#39;s heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated\u2014and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty. Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability \"to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness.\" She writes \"with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming,\" said the New York Times. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation, but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when it was first published. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\u00a0is Carson McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.",

In The Mind of God, physicist Paul Davies explores whether modern science can provide the key that will unlock this last secret. In his quest for an ultimate explanation, Davies reexamines the great questions that have preoccupied humankind for millennia, and in the process explores, among other topics, the origin and evolution of the cosmos, the nature of life and consciousness, and the claim that our universe is a kind of gigantic computer. Charting the ways in which the theories of such scientists as Newton, Einstein, and more recently Stephen Hawking and Richard Feynman have altered our conception of the physical universe. Davies puts these scientists' discoveries into context with the writings of philosophers such as Plato. Descartes, Hume, and Kant. His startling conclusion is that the universe is \"no minor byproduct of mindless, purposeless forces. We are truly meant to be here.\" By the means of science, we can truly see into the mind of God.",

        "Description": "Kids are natural inventors, bursting with notions so crazy they just might work. Chester Greenwood was just a boy when his big cold ears prompted him to fashion wire and fur into the world's first earmuffs. Caney shows how to get into \"an inventing frame of mind\" and how to look at everyday objects in new ways, as clues to fresh ideas. From keeping a good notebook to setting up a workshop, from building the prototype to applying for a patent, Steven Caney covers it all, even showing the young entrepreneur how to market an invention successfully. To get the creativity flowing, here are also hundreds of fantasy ideas that still need to be invented: everything from a temperature-regulating straw to sunburn alarm tabs. There are also extensive plans for twenty projects kids can build from ordinary household items. And to demonstrate the many sources of creative thinking, Caney tells the stories behind 25 landmark American inventions. Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club. Suitable for ages 8-13. 215,000 copies in print.",
