Each photograph is accompanied by an extensive caption that points out the important details in the image and summarizes the techniques and exposure times used to make the photographs.  As we proceed through the text, which covers our solar system, the stars, the nebulae, the near galaxies, and, finally, the distant galaxies, we learn how astronomers have interpreted what they have seen and how the new images have changed what we know about the cosmos. Recent photos form the Hubble, for example, have shown the \"signature\" of black holes -- objects so massive and dense that not even light can escape their gravitational pull. Other images taken recently are remarkable for their high resolution and extraordinary beauty, such as those revealing the famous Horsehead Nebula.            The book includes an introduction by Richard M. West of the European Southern Observatory.",

        "Authors": "By Barkley, Charles and Wilbon, Michael (INT)",
        "Description": "Charles Barkley has never been shy about expressing his opinions. Michael Jordan once said that we all want to say the things that Barkley says, but we don\u2019t dare. But even die-hard followers of the all-time NBA great, the star of TNT\u2019s Inside the NBA and CNN\u2019s TalkBack Live, will be astonished by just how candid and provocative he is in this book\u2014and just how big his ambitions are. Though he addresses weighty issues with a light touch and prefers to stir people to think by making them laugh, there\u2019s nothing Charles Barkley shies away from here\u2014not race, not class, not big money, not scandal, not politics, not personalities, nothing. \u201cEarly on,\u201d says Washington Post columnist and ESPN talk show host Michael Wilbon in his Introduction, \u201cBarkley made his peace with mixing it up, and decided the consequences were very much worth it to him. And that makes him as radically different in these modern celebrity times as a 6-foot-4-inch power forward.\u201dIf there\u2019s one thing Charles Barkley knows, it\u2019s the crying need for honest, open discussion in this country\u2014the more uncomfortable the subject, the more necessary the dialogue. And if the discussion leader can be as wise, irreverent, (occasionally) profane and (consistently) funny as Charles Barkley, so much the better. Many people are going to be shocked and scandalized by I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It, but many more will stand up and cheer. Like Molly Ivins or Bill O\u2019Reilly, Charles Barkley is utterly his own thinker, and everything he says comes from deep reflection. One way or another, if more blood hasn\u2019t reached your brain by the time you\u2019ve finished this book, maybe you\u2019ve been embalmed.",

Blood is a man of contradictions, of learning and wisdom, but also a man with a secret past that has scorched his soul. He sets forth to establish himself as a trader, hauling with him Sally, a sixteen-year-old girl won from the madam of a brothel over a game of cards. Their arrival in the Indian Stream triggers an escalating series of clashes that serves to sever the master/servant bond between them, and offers both a second chance with life. But as the conflicts within the community spill over and attract the attention of outside authorities, Blood becomes a target to those seeking easy blame for their troubles.

        "Description": "The Vision of Emma Blau is the luminous epic of a bicultural family filled with passion and aspirations, tragedy and redemption. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Stefan Blau, whom readers will remember from Stones from the River, flees Burgdorf, a small town in Germany, and comes to America in search of the vision he has dreamed of every night. The novel closes nearly a century later with Stefan's granddaughter, Emma, and the legacy of his dream: the Wasserburg, a once-grand apartment house filled with the hidden truths of its inhabitants both past and present. Ursula Hegi creates a fascinating picture of immigrants in America: their dreams and disappointments, the challenges of assimilation, the frailty of language and its transcendence, the love that bonds generations and the cultural wedges that drive them apart.",

Simon's same willingness to open his heart to the reader permeates The Play Goes On.  This second act takes the reader from the mid-1970s to the present, a period in which Simon wrote some of his most popular and critically acclaimed plays, including the Brighton Beach trilogy and Lost in Yonkers, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. Simon experienced enormous professional success during this time, but in his personal life he struggled to find that same sense of happiness and satisfaction. After the death of his first wife, he and his two young daughters left New York for Hollywood. There he remarried, and when that foundered he remarried again. Told with his characteristic humor and unflinching sense of irony, The Play Goes On is rich with stories of how Simon's art came to imitate his life.  Simon's forty-plus plays make up a body of work that is a long-running memoir in its own right, yet here, in a deeper and more personal book than his first volume, Simon offers a revealing look at an artist in crisis but still able and willing to laugh at himself.",

Sasha Ozerovsky is a young expert in Russian art at Leighton's, an exclusive Manhattan auction house. When a dealer arrives from Moscow with an exquisite 1913 Faberg\u00e9 figurine, Sasha immediately recognizes a rare masterpiece. But in the high stakes art world, the price of an object is tied to its history. If Sasha can determine for whom the bejeweled piece was made and where it has been hiding for the past century, its value -- and Sasha's career -- will soar.  But as Sasha moves between New York's high society and Russia's new rich, he discovers that the piece once belonged to his family, and he must face questions about their past that he never dared to ask.  Superbly plotted and evoking the elegance of Russia's gilded age, Object of Virtue is an enthralling tale that explores what happens to a family torn between vanity and virtue.",

No photograph has better captured the complexity and personality of JFK, the Kennedy family, and the spirit of Camelot, Now in JFK Remembered, Jacques Lowe presents the definitive photographic portrait of Kennedy and tells the story of what he saw during his years with JFK.Jacques Lowe first became friendly with the Kennedys when he was assigned by three different magazines to photograph an emerging crusader named Robert Kennedy. His work impresed the entire Kennedy family so much that he received a midnight phone call from Joseph Kennedy, who asked Lowe to photograph his other son, Jack, then a U.S. senator. What began as a family favor evolved into the most personal relationship JFK - or any other president since Abraham Lincoln - would ever have with a photographer: Lowe took over 40,000 photos, covering the last five years of JFK's life, including the White House years.In JFK Remembered, Lowe has chosen 198 of his best photographs; some are classics and others have never before been published. We see Kennedy at work and with his family, at public events, and during private moments. In his accompanying text, Lowe describes how Kennedy allowed him unrestricted access to his campaign for the presidency, and how an unspoken trust developed between them and carried over into the rest of Kennedy's life. In Lowe's photographic memoir, we see the emergence of JFK as a national leader and icon, and we are reminded once more of the magic that was John Fitzgerald Kennedy.",

I love the Sex God and he is my one and only, but try telling that to my lips.   Georgia has finally put her red-bottomosity to rest and chosen Robbie the Sex God over Dave the Laugh. After all, with the Sex God she'll be a pop-star girlfriend and go on tour! Besides, Dave the Laugh is now dating her friend Ellen (although that didn't stop Georgia from snogging him at a party ... ).   But when the Sex God is never around and Dave the Laugh breaks up with Ellen, Georgia doesn't know what to think! Is she doomed to be a pop-star widow, or will she take her own bottom firmly in hand and blow her cosmic horn? And will her cat, Angus (the size of a small Labrador, only mad), ever get over the shame of having his trouser snake addendums snipped? As always, in Georgia's life, nothing ever turns out as planned!",

But if bringing these disparate realities closer together is a goal, Feng Shui Goes to the Office can help. This book is designed to make work feel as satisfying as play . . . to help you identify what parts of work are blissful and what parts need other supports.\"  -- From the Introduction  Who has not, at some point, looked around his or her workspace and felt decidedly uninspired, de-energized, or distracted by what is a less than optimal environment? Whether you write copy in a creative field or crunch numbers in the financial world, your office surroundings have a profound effect on your health, happiness, and, yes, success. Feng shui master and bestselling author Nancilee Wydra can help you design a more productive space or, at the very least, help you make minimal adjustments that can result in big differences.  Whether you have a window office in a high-rise, a putty-colored cubicle without natural light, a make-do home office, or a simple desktop in the hall, Feng Shui Goes to the Office offers astonishingly simple techniques for creating a more balanced workplace. Just the simple act of relocating a phone, adding a splash of color, or incorporating better lighting can make a valuable difference.  Nancilee Wydra, founder of the Pyramid School of Feng Shui, conducts feng shui workshops across the country. The most published American on the topic, she is the author of Feng Shui: The Book of Cures, Feng Shui in the Garden, and Feng Shui and How to Look Before You Love.

Scientists and academics have spent entire careers investigating the nature of relationships, dating, and marriage, yet their findings are inaccessible to ordinary people, hidden in obscure journals read only by other academics. Now the bestselling author of the 100 Simple Secrets series has collected the most current and significant data from more than a thousand studies on relationships and spells out the key findings in plain English. The advice is not based on one person's unique experiences or opinions, but offers for the first time the research of noted scientists studying the lives and loves of average Americans. Each of the findings is accompanied by a true story that shows the results in action.Love is hard to calculate: Researchers have proven that a partner's age, income, education, and religion are unrelated factors in the likelihood of relationship satisfaction.Always trying to win can lead to a major loss: People who feel a sense of competition with their partner are 37 percent less likely to feel that their relationship is satisfying.leave the past in the past: More than 40 percent of people report that jealousy over a previous relationship is a source of conflict in their current relationship.",

        "Description": "Parenting by example. Using the simple, powerful message that turned Children Learn What They Live into an international bestseller with over 1.5 million copies in print, Drs. Dorothy Law Nolte and Rachel Harris bring their unique perspective to families with adolescents. Structured, like the first book, around an inspirational poem, Teenagers Learn What They Live addresses the turbulent teenage years, when a stew of hormones, pressures, and temptations makes for such extreme challenges for parents and children. Teenagers addresses popularity and peer pressure (\"If teenagers live with rejection, they learn to feel lost\"); the responsibilities of maturity (\"If teenagers live with too many rules, they learn how to get around them./ If teenagers live with too few rules, they learn to ignore the needs of others\"); body image and the allure of cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol (\"If teenagers live with healthy habits, they learn to be kind to their bodies\"). Central to the book are ways for parents to communicate with their teenage children-including how to deal with being \"tuned out\" and when to start the conversation again-and how to strike the right balance between holding on and accepting a teen's growing independence. Hundreds of examples of parent-child interactions cover everything from the all-night graduation party to problems of sexual identity, providing great guidance as well as effective conversation starters.",

        "Description": "An Innovative Blueprint for Enduring Client Relationships  More than 15 million people in this country earn their livings by serving clients, and their numbers are growing every day. Unfortunately, far too few develop the skills and strategies needed to rise to the top in a world where clients have almost unlimited access to information and expertise. Supported by more than one hundred case studies and wisdom gleaned from interviews with dozens of leading CEOs and prominent business advisors, Clients for Life identifies what clients really want and lays out the core qualities that distinguish the client advisor -- an irreplaceable resource -- from the expert for hire -- a tradable commodity.   Experts are specialists; advisors become deep generalists who have broad perspective. Experts are for hire; advisors have selfless independence, balancing client devotion with objectivity and detachment. Experts have professional credibility; advisors develop deep personal trust. Experts analyze; advisors synthesize and bring big-picture thinking to the table. Experts supply expertise and information; advisors are educators who provide insight and wisdom.   Portraits of history's most famously successful advisors, including Machiavelli, Sir Thomas More, and J. P. Morgan, underscore these timeless qualities that modern professionals need to develop to excel in today's competitive environment.",

Of course, this is more than snippy waiters or rude drivers who cut you off. It is a finely honed selection of 738 exasperating things, people, situations, complaints, and attitudes that everyone who's ever had a bad day can appreciate.
