        "Title": "Bomb Power: The Modern Presidency and the National Security State",
        "Authors": "By Wills, Garry",
        "Description": "From Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Garry Wills, a groundbreaking examination of how the atomic bomb profoundly altered the nature of American democracy and has left us in a state of war alert ever since.  In Bomb Power, Garry Wills reveals how the atomic bomb transformed our nation down to its deepest constitutional roots-by dramatically increasing the power of the modern presidency and redefining the government as a national security state-in ways still felt today. A masterful reckoning from one of America's preeminent historians, Bomb Power draws a direct line from the Manhattan Project to the usurpations of George W. Bush. The invention of the atomic bomb was a triumph of official secrecy and military discipline-the project was covertly funded at the behest of the president and, despite its massive scale, never discovered by Congress or the press. This concealment was perhaps to be expected in wartime, but Wills persuasively argues that the Manhattan Project then became a model for the covert operations and overt authority that have defined American government in the nuclear era. The wartime emergency put in place during World War II extended into the Cold War and finally the war on terror, leaving us in a state of continuous war alert for sixty-eight years and counting. The bomb forever changed the institution of the presidency since only the president controls \"the button\" and, by extension, the fate of the world. Wills underscores how radical a break this was from the division of powers established by our founding fathers and how it in turn has enfeebled Congress and the courts. The bomb also placed new emphasis on the president's military role, creating a cult around the commander in chief. The tendency of modern presidents to flaunt military airs, Wills points out, is entirely a postbomb phenomenon. Finally, the Manhattan Project inspired the vast secretive apparatus of the national security state, including intelligence agencies such as the CIA and NSA, which remain largely unaccountable to Congress and the American people. Wills recounts how, following World War II, presidential power increased decade by decade until reaching its stunning apogee with the Bush administration. Both provocative and illuminating, Bomb Power casts the history of the postwar period in a new light and sounds an alarm about the continued threat to our Constitution.",

        "Description": "A New York Times Best Seller!New York Times bestselling author Jesse Ventura is back with more conspiracies that our government wishes you didn\u2019t know about!In this explosive account of wrongful acts and ensuing cover-ups, Jesse Ventura offers a different side to the stories we\u2019ve all heard and read about in the history books. He takes a look at the wide gap between what the government knows and what is revealed to the American people. The media is complicit in these acts of deception, often refusing to consider alternate possibilities and dismissing voices that diverge from public opinion. He will look closely at the theories that have been presented over the years and examine the truth as well as the lies. Ventura does not shy away from the tough questions. As he states, &#147;When I get denied something, I do the opposite of getting intimidated&#151;I get angry.\u201dNow with new conspiracies added including information on the CIA torture scandal and the financial meltdown of 2008, you will see how the United States government continues to abuse our civil liberties and why we need to continue to stand up for what we know is right.You may not believe everything in American Conspiracies, but it is guaranteed to make you think harder about everything you do believe.Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

        "Title": "Going Rogue: An American Life",
        "Authors": "By Palin, Sarah",
        "Description": "On September 2, 2008 Alaska Governor Sarah Palin gave a speech at the Republican National Convention that electrified the nation and instantly made her one of the most recognizable women in the world.As chief executive of America's largest state, she had built a record as a reformer who cast aside politics-as-usual and pushed through changes other politicians only talked about: Toward energy independence. Ethics reform. And the biggest private sector infrastructure project in U.S. history. And while revitalizing public school funding and ensuring the state met its responsibilities to seniors and Alaska Native populations, Palin also beat the political 'good ol' boys club' at their own game and brought Big Oil to heel. Like her GOP running mate, John McCain, Palin wasn't a packaged and over-produced 'candidate.' She was a Main Street American woman: a working mom, wife of a blue collar union man, and mother of five children, the oldest serving his country in Iraq and the youngest, an infant with special needs. Palin's hometown story touched a populist nerve, rallying hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to the GOP ticket.But as the campaign unfolded, Palin became a lightning rod for both praise and criticism. Supporters called her 'refreshing,' 'honest,' a kitchen-table public servant they felt would fight for their interests. Opponents derided her as a wide-eyed Pollyanna unprepared for national leadership. But none of them knew the real Sarah Palin.In this eagerly anticipated memoir, Palin paints an intimate portrait of growing up in the wilds of Alaska, meeting her lifelong love, her decision to enter politics, the importance of faith and family, and the unique joys and trials of life as a high-profile working mother. She also opens up for the first time about the 2008 presidential race, providing a rare, mom's-eye view of high-stakes national politics - from patriots dedicated to Country First to slick politicos bent on winning at any cost. Going Rogue traces one ordinary citizen's extraordinary journey, revealing Palin's vision of a way forward for America and her unfailing hope in the greatest nation on earth.",

        "Description": "Why do grown men play with trains? Is it a primal attachment to childhood, nostalgia for the lost age of rail travel, or the stuff of flat-out obsession? In this delightful and unprecedented book, Grand Prix legend Sam Posey tracks those who share his \u201cpassion beyond scale\u201d and discovers a wonderfully strange and vital culture.Posey\u2019s first layout, wired by his mother in the years just after the Second World War, was, as he writes in his Introduction, \u201ca miniature universe which I could operate on my own. Speed and control: I was fascinated by both, as well as by the way they were inextricably bound together.\u201d Eventually, when Posey\u2019s son was born, he was convinced that building him a basement layout would be the highest expression of fatherhood. Sixteen years and thousands of hours later, this project, \u201cthe outgrowth of chance meetings, unexpected friendships, mistakes, illness, latent ambitions, and sheer luck\u201d was completed. But for Posey, the creation of his HO-scale masterpiece based on the historic Colorado Midland, was just the beginning.In Playing with Trains, Sam Posey ventures well beyond the borders of his layout in northwestern Connecticut, to find out what makes the top modelers tick. He expects to find men \u201cengaged in a genial hobby, happy to spend a few hours a week escaping the pressures of contemporary life.\u201d Instead he uncovers a world of extremes\u2013extreme commitment, extreme passion, and extreme differences of approach. For instance, Malcolm Furlow, holed up on his ranch in the wilderness of New Mexico, insists that model railroading is defined by scenery and artistic self-expression. On the other hand, Tony Koester, a New Jersey modeler, believes his \u201cmission\u201d is to replicate, with fanatical precision and authenticity, the way a real railroad operates. Going to extremes himself, Posey actually \u201ctest drives\u201d a real steam engine in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, in an attempt to understand the great machines that inspired the models and connect us to a time when \u201cthe railroad was inventing America.\u201d Timeless and original, Playing with Trains reveals a classic, questing  American world.",

Customers are being wooed ever more feverishly by competitors offering better prices, better deals--a process that has dramatically accelerated with the growth of the Internet. As information about customers becomes more plentiful and detailed, and as customers themselves become more interactive with the companies they buy from, business success hinges increasingly on creating long-term, profitable, \"one-to-one\" customer relationships.One-to-one marketing is nothing short of a revolution. Dell, Cisco, FedEx, Owens Corning, American Express, Amazon.com, Hewlett-Packard, and BellSouth, among others, have built their success on enhancing customer knowledge and interaction.Yet managers and executives today find themselves wrestling with the issue of how to become a part of this revolution.That's why one-to-one marketing pioneers Don Peppers, Martha Rogers, and Bob Dorf wrote this book.The One to One Fieldbook is the first hands-on manual for implementing customer relationship management programs, featuring step-by-step guidance on how to initiate, evaluate, and upgrade one-to-one initiatives.Among the topics covered in the book: how to determine whether you're ready to undertake a one-to-one program, how to evaluate what different customers are worth to your business, and how to customize your products or services. It includes chapters on gathering customer information, on how to measure results, on how to use the power of the World Wide Web--and much more. Each chapter features checklists of things to do, activities to enhance one-to-one skills, and questionnaires to evaluate your progress.A complete toolkit for companies implementing customer relationship programs, The One to One Fieldbook will help you identify your best customers, keep them longer, and grow them bigger--so that you can compete more successfully in the Interactive Age.",

When John Sutter's aristocratic wife killed her mafia don lover, John left America and set out in his sailboat on a three-year journey around the world, eventually settling in London. Now, ten years later, he has come home to the Gold Coast, that stretch of land on the North Shore of Long Island that once held the greatest concentration of wealth and power in America, to attend the imminent funeral of an old family servant. Taking up temporary residence in the gatehouse of Stanhope Hall, John finds himself living only a quarter of a mile from Susan who has also returned to Long Island. But Susan isn't the only person from John's past who has reemerged: Though Frank Bellarosa, infamous Mafia don and Susan's ex-lover, is long dead, his son, Anthony, is alive and well, and intent on two missions: Drawing John back into the violent world of the Bellarosa family, and exacting revenge on his father's murderer--Susan Sutter. At the same time, John and Susan's mutual attraction resurfaces and old passions begin to reignite, and John finds himself pulled deeper into a familiar web of seduction and betrayal. In THE GATE HOUSE, acclaimed author Nelson Demille brings us back to that fabled spot on the North Shore -- a place where past, present, and future collides with often unexpected results.",

        "Description": "Four famed '60s radicals are gunned down at long range by a sniper. Under enormous media scrutiny, the FBI quickly concludes that Marine war hero Carl Hitchcock, whose ninety-three kills were considered the leading body count tally among American marksman in Vietnam, was the shooter. But as the Bureau, led by Special Agent Nick Memphis, bears down, Hitchcock commits suicide. In closing out the investigation, Nick discovers a case made in heaven: everything fits, from timeline, ballistics, and forensics to motive, means, and opportunity. Maybe it's a little too perfect.   Nick asks his friend, the retired Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger, to examine the data. Using a skill set no other man on earth possesses, Swagger soon discovers unseen anomalies and gradually begins to unravel a sophisticated conspiracy -- one that would require the highest level of warcraft by the most superb special operations professionals. As Swagger penetrates the deepest secrets of the sniper world and its new technology, Nick stands firm in the face of hardball PR initiatives and an inflamed media calling for his ouster.   Swagger soon closes in, and those responsible will stop at nothing to take him out. But these heavily armed men make the mistake of thinking they are hunting Bob, when he is, in fact, hunting them.   I, Sniper will satisfy Stephen Hunter's legions of fans and win him droves of new ones with its signature blend of brilliant plotting, vivid characters, razor-sharp dialogue, and extraordinary gunfights. And when Swagger and the last of his antagonists finally face each other, reenacting a classic ritual of arms, it is clear that at times there's nothing more necessary than a good man with a gun and the guts to use it.",

        "Title": "A Bully Father: Theodore Roosevelt's Letters to His Children",
        "Authors": "By Roosevelt, Theodore, Kerr, Joan Paterson, and Loomis, Robert D. (EDT)",
        "Description": "The Roosevelt family, with its rambunctious father and six children, invaded and occupied the White House as no other family has since. Theodore Roosevelt - whose wife once called him her \"oldest and rather worst child\" - was a marvelous father. Not only did he write constantly to his children, but he played with them, guided them, and loved them as do only the best fathers, famous or otherwise.Their lives together began at Sagamore Hill, their home in Oyster Bay on Long Island, and continued with equal gusto as they took up residence in the White House. A Bully Father features a terrific portfolio of photographs, some never before published, of the family at play.Roosevelt's letters have been considered by many a minor classic in American literature. Wonderfully wise, warm, and witty, they have long been out of print. The Evening Sun, in 1919, wrote: \"These letters ... lift Roosevelt to a higher level of purely literary attainment than any of his other published writings. They are of tremendously absorbing interest from any angle or view.\"",

        "Title": "Inside Picture Books",
        "Authors": "By Spitz, Ellen Handler and Coles, Robert (FRW)",
        "Description": "Mention a name from a beloved childhood picture book?Madeline, Corduroy, Peter Rabbit, Max and his ?wild things\u201d?and most adults can recollect a bright image, fragments of a story, the timbre of a certain reading voice, the sensation of being held, and best of all being together with someone and enveloped in fantasy. Why do picture book images shown to us as young children linger in our minds? How do picture books shape our lives early on and even later into adulthood? This book takes up such questions. It explores the profound impact of the experience of reading to children. Ellen Handler Spitz reveals how classic picture books transmit psychological wisdom, convey moral lessons, shape tastes, and implant subtle prejudices.Each chapter of the book discusses well-known children\u2019s books?Goodnight Moon, Babar, Little Black Sambo, to name a few?that deal with a theme of importance to young children. These include bedtime, separation, loss, and death; curiosity, disobedience, and punishment; and identity and self-acceptance. Focusing on the relationship between a child and an adult reader, Spitz explains the notion of ?conversational reading\u201d and emphasizes the mutual benefits of dialogue and intimacy. This book not only gives parents, grandparents, teachers, therapists, and scholars a new understanding of the meaning of picture books, it also empowers adults to interpret and choose future cultural experiences for their children.",

But when he is summoned to Rome to examine a client's fragment of an ancient stone map, he stumbles across a startling secret. The discovery reveals not only an ancient intelligence operation to protect an artifact hidden for 2000 years, but also a ruthless modern plot to destroy all trace of it by a mysterious radical bent on erasing all remnants of Jewish and Christian presence from the Temple Mount.With a cutting-edge plot as intricately layered as the ancient sites it explores, The Last Ember is a riveting tale spanning the high-stakes worlds of archaeology, politics, and terrorism, in its portrayal of the modern struggle to define - and redefine - history itself.",
