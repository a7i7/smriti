Whether discussing Elizabeth Bishop or Don DeLillo, Rilke or Kerouac, Keats or The Great Gatsby, he brings fresh insight, sharp thinking, and reflective sensitivity to each of his subjects.A brilliant cultural commentator, Birkerts also addresses broader, more associative topics, such as biography and the enigma of poetic inspiration, contemporary nostalgia, our modern sense of time, and the future of the creative spirit. As Jonathan Franzen wrote in The New Yorker, \"Birkerts on reading fiction is like M.F.K. Fisher on eating or Norman Maclean on fly casting. He makes you want to go do it.\" This is writing about reading at its best.",

Each religion has pockets of influence, and some hold sway over large regions - such as the Baptist church in the South, the Catholic church in the Northeast, and the Mormon church in Utah. Yet larger than any denomination is America's emerging civic religion - Protestant in flavor - which gives as much emphasis to the Fourth of July or Thanksgiving as it does to any sectarian holiday.Few major surveys of religion have been conducted in America until now. By participating in a commercial, computer-generated telephone survey, Barry Kosmin and Seymour Lachman were able to sample 113,000 people across the continental United States, making their National Survey of Religious Identification, the most extensive of its kind in contemporary America. One Nation Under God contains the fascinating and, at times, surprising results of their survey and analysis, giving unprecedented insight into the changing forces that shape our politics and beliefs, and the powerful social dynamics that make this country unique.",

Since that time Amenkor had been ruled by the individual who held the Throne, and down through the centuries the city had prospered and that ancient threat had been all but forgotten.Then, a millennium ago, Amenkor was caught in the White Fire, a mysterious force that swept across the land spreading madness, drought, famine, and disease in its wake. With the passing of that first Fire, the ruling Mistress of the era had been found dead on the steps leading up to the palace. And since that time the city had begun a slow, inexorable downward spiral.Varis had learned the art of survival as a very young child in the slums of Amenkor. And when the mysterious White Fire swept through the city for the second time in a millennium. Varis had survived that as well. But she had been changed by the Fire's spell, and she was not the only denizen of Amenkor marked by the White Fire. Eryn, Mistress of the Skewed Throne, had continued to reign over the city after the Fire's passing. Yet from that moment, Amenkor's decline had escalated, and Eryn herself seemed to hover on the edge of madness.As Amenkor continued to deteriorate, Varis came to the attention of some of the most powerful people in the city, people who could see her unique potential. And she found herself transformed from gutterscum to unofficial Seeker to bodyguard to assassin. Yet none of her skills could save her from a destiny she would never have wished for or imagined.After a confrontation that perhaps no one else could have survived, Varis became the new Mistress of the Skewed Throne. Untrained, unprepared, and not certain who she could trust, Varis took the Throne at the most perilous point in Amenkor's long history. The city was on the brink of starvation, thanks to a fire that had destroyed most of the warehouse district, and the trading ships sent out to bring back the supplies needed to feed the city had disappeared without a trace. And both Varis and Eryn were obsessed with a vision only they had shared - a vision of Amenkor invaded by an unknown enemy, the harbor watch towers destroyed, wrecked ships sinking in waters stained red with blood, even as the city itself was engulfed in flames.",

Humate is in deep denial about this familial scandal generations deep, but Quirt must try to covince him to help, compelled by his doom and by the stirrings of a new love that cannot possibly be realized in his nameless condition.

For optimal health, for optimal well-being, it is necessary to keep your individual body chemistry in balance.People would think absurd if someone were to suggest they buy a generic dress or move into a generic home, yet they are perfectly willing to follow a generic diet. Feed Your Body Right teaches you how, through a series of simple tests and blood studies (analyzed with the help of your doctor or nutritionist), you can devise an individualized nutrition program that will work for your particular body type and metabolism.Feed Your Body Right discusses the Life Balances Health Program to which, with your doctor, you may want to subscribe. It can show you how to make basic, safe adjustments to your daily nutrient intake, creating a bodily environment more resistant to shock, disease, and stress. The tables and graphs in the book will not only help you to understand basic chemical processes and how they effect you, but also how to follow and evaluate your own progress through the program of your choosing.With your individual body chemistry in balance, you will be on your way to a life freed from fatigue, allergies, aches, and depression. You'll soon find a new buoyancy and zest for life. Best of all, once you understand your unique nutritional needs, you can be your own guide to achieving health.",

They get frustrated losing their scroll position; they get annoyed waiting for refresh; they struggle to reorient themselves on every new page. And the list goes on. With asynchronous JavaScript and XML, known as \"Ajax,\" you can give them a better experience. Once users have experienced an Ajax interface, they hate to go back. Ajax is new way of thinking that can result in a flowing and intuitive interaction with the user.Ajax in Action helps you implement that thinking--it explains how to distribute the application between the client and the server (hint: use a \"nested MVC\" design) while retaining the integrity of the system. You will learn how to ensure your app is flexible and maintainable, and how good, structured design can help avoid problems like browser incompatibilities. Along the way it helps you unlearn many old coding habits. Above all, it opens your mind to the many advantages gained by placing much of the processing in the browser. If you are a web developer who has prior experience with web technologies, this book is for you. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.",

In The Care and Feeding of Indigo Children, Doreen Virtue, Ph.D., explores the psyche of these special kids and offers alternative solutions to Ritalin based on her extensive research and interviews with child-care experts, teachers, parents, and the Indigo Children themselves. Read the accounts of these remarkable children as they explain why they act-out, are aggressive or withdrawn; and what they want from the adults in their lives. You\u2019ll also be fascinated by the psychic experiences that these kids have had in their lives so far. This is a groundbreaking book that can positively affect the ways in which you interact with your child, altering the shape of their future in miraculous ways.",

        "Authors": "By Aidan, Pamela",
        "Description": "\u00b3There was little danger of encountering the Bennet sisters ever again.\u00b2   Jane Austen's classic novel Pride and Prejudice is beloved by millions, but little is revealed in the book about the mysterious and handsome hero, Mr. Darcy. And so the question has long remained: Who is Fitzwilliam Darcy?   Pamela Aidan's trilogy finally answers that long-standing question, creating a rich parallel story that follows Darcy as he meets and falls in love with Elizabeth Bennet. Duty and Desire, the second book in the trilogy, covers the \"silent time\" of Austen's novel, revealing Darcy's private struggle to overcome his attraction to Elizabeth while fulfilling his roles as landlord, master, brother, and friend.   When Darcy pays a visit to an old classmate in Oxford in an attempt to shake Elizabeth from his mind, he is set upon by husband-hunting society ladies and ne'er-do-well friends from his university days, all with designs on him -- some for good and some for ill. He and his sartorial genius of a valet, Fletcher, must match wits with them all, but especially with the curious Lady Sylvanie.   Irresistibly authentic and entertaining, Duty and Desire remains true to the spirit and events of Pride and Prejudice while incorporating fascinating new characters, and is sure to dazzle Austen fans and newcomers alike.",

        "Title": "Islam: The Straight Path",
        "Authors": "By Esposito, John L.",
        "Description": "The Iranian revolution, the Lebanese and Afghan civil wars, the assassination of Egypt's Anwar Sadat, the Gulf War--these crises have dominated the headlines and global politics, yet few of us know anything about Islam, the faith of the people and nations of the world's second largest religion. Islam and Muslims have often been viewed through a series of stereotypes--as fundamentalists, extremists, radicals--which distort our understanding of the faith of its one billion followers, who span the globe from Africa to Asia, from the United States to the Soviet Union. Now John L. Esposito offers a timely revised edition ofIslam, his widely acclaimed guide to Islamic history, faith, culture, and politics.In Islam, Esposito provides a succinct, up-to-date survey of the Islamic experience, an introduction to the faith, belief, and practice of Islam from its origins to its contemporary resurgence. He traces the emergence and development of this dynamic faith and its impact on world history and politics. He discusses the formation of Islamic belief and practice (law, theology, philosophy, and mysticism), chronicling the struggle of Muslims to define and adhere to their Islamic way of life. Equally important is the essential information Esposito provides on the contemporary world of Islam, from Muslim responses to the challenges of colonialism and modernization to the reassertion of Islam in politics and society.With years of teaching and traveling in the Islamic world, Esposito offers an inside understanding of Muslim faith and thought. Lucidly written and expansive in scope, this new edition of a volume highly respected in both the West and the Islamic world provides keen insight into one of the world's least understood religions.",
