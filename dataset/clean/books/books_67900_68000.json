        "Authors": "By Page, Jake and Fox, Michael W. (FRW)",
        "Description": "Do Cats Hear with Their Feet? traces the evolution of cats from the time they first adapted their feline form about 20 million years ago. Exploring every aspect of a cat's life\u2014from predation, to play, to communication\u2014Jake Page shows us what a cat's daily life is really like. He gives us a cat's-eye view of a bird hunt in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and explains why cats will hunt even when they are full, and why no self-respecting cat would eat vegetables. In sections that will be of interest to every cat owner, Jake Page demonstrates why territory is all-important to cats, investigates cat ESP, and shows that cats have, in fact, never been fully domesticated; they've just graciously decided to reside with us. Beautifully illustrated, this engaging book is full of surprising facts. Did you know: Black cats do better in the crowded conditions of cities than any other color? Cats are as allergic to humans as humans are to cats? Cats have survived falls from heights of over seven stories?Do Cats Hear with Their Feet? will show readers exactly why cats are such amazing creatures, and why humans have been crazy about them for centuries.",

        "Description": "For twenty-five years, people like Marian Shelton have believed that their loved ones, in this case her husband, Charles, were still alive in Vietnam. Shelton never once removed the Missing in Action bracelet that bore the name of her husband. Then, in October 1990, she finally took the bracelet off her wrist and killed herself with a pistol.Marian Shelton represents just one of many MIA families ripped asunder in the aftermath of Vietnam. The hopes of these people have been kept alive by activists who would have all of us believe that there are many prisoners still alive in Vietnam. Fake pictures are \"discovered,\" \"sightings\" are reported to families. Sixty-two percent of all Americans believe that there are Americans still being held in Southeast Asia, and the belief factor rises to 84 percent among Vietnam veterans.Prisoners of Hope, for the first time, shows what happened to most of the prisoners captured in Vietnam and exposes those who would exploit the missing servicemen's families, including the federal government, which has lied about the situation for years.",

        "Description": "The founders of one of today's hottest, most innovative advertising agencies explain how to ignite the kind of marketing explosions that will capture customers' attention.Linda Kaplan Thaler, the CEO and Chief Creative Officer of the Kaplan Thaler Group, is the brains behind a host of memorable and highly successful ads, from the irresistibly sentimental \"Kodak moment\" campaign to Herbal Essences' \"totally organic experience\" to, most recently, the irrepressible AFLAC duck. In Bang!, Kaplan Thaler and Robin Koval of the Kaplan Thaler Group, currently ranked as the fastest-growing ad agency in the country, offer the kind of out-of-the-box thinking and proven strategies that marketers anywhere can use to create loud, clear, attention-grabbing messages about their products and services.Presenting an arsenal of \"big bang\" ideas, the authors discuss how to create a memorable publicity hook and how to design attention-grabbing packaging that taps into consumers' innermost desires. They interweave entertaining accounts of their successes and failures, as well as those of other companies to suggest specific ways to establish an atmosphere conducive to innovative breakthroughs--why having \"enough\" time to work on a project can be a disadvantage, and why having a small staff in a cramped space is often the best way to come up with big ideas.Full of colorful anecdotes and inspiring accounts of campaigns that have catapulted revenues and increased market shares, Bang! shows how to create a marketing campaign that rises above the banal barrage of commercials to create a genuine marketing explosion.",

They suggest that, like the fabled Buddhists feeling different parts of an elephant, surveying together the different concepts and schools of thought of books by the 50 American national security writers discussed can lead to a better understanding of the holistic picture of the United States and its role in international affairs. They have structured their analysis according to authors that offer a neo-Kantian view of growing democratization and economic prosperity, those that put forward a neo-Hobbesian perspective emphasizing stressful security affairs and frequent military solutions, those that emphasize the impact of technological developments in world affairs, and those that examine the evolution of American national security strategy in the contemporary world.

        "Title": "Lightning in the Storm: The 101st Air Assault Division In the Gulf War",
        "Authors": "By TAYLOR, Thomas",
        "Description": "\"The Air Force and armor were the thunder of Desert Storm,\" said Gen. Schwarzkopf, \"while the 101st was the lightning.\" This is the story of the Screaming Eagles - the hell-bent, heliborne soldiers of the 101st who hurled the lightning bolts.The first one struck to begin the air war, a daring night raid which punched a hole in Iraq's radar fence for allied bombers to light up the sky over Baghdad on January 17, 1991. This white knuckle raid was recorded from beginning to end through the pilots' infrared cameras. Actual dialogue from the tapes provides a chapter of fascinating authenticity.The five month run up to the hundred-hour ground war is fascinating in and of itself. The 101st pitched thousands of Arab tents for a base (\"Fort Camel\") from where they would cover a front as large as the combined areas of Vermont and New Hampshire to block an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia. Through dozens of interviews and hundreds of army videos never publicly viewed, the peculiar experiences of Desert Shield are described in many voices, from corporals to generals.The unique privations of the theater are described, where for the first time alcohol and local women were absent from war, replaced by the umbilical cord of mail, and the gripping memory of a time when the 101st drove convoys along freeways lined by tens of thousands of cheering Americans.The role of Vietnam veterans harboring memories of jungle warfare is described as they run the desert war, as is their collective vow that never again would victory on the battlefield be nullified. That opportunity for unconditional victory came in the first dawn of the ground war. Like some rampaging cyclone, the 101st touched down in the Euphrates Valley, landing brigades throughout an area the size of the mid-Atlantic seaboard. Far ahead of the allies' tanks, the Screaming Eagles strangled Iraq's lifeline into Kuwait - in the space of a single day. Darting hundreds of miles during the hundred hours, they were poised to leap on Baghdad when President Bush decided it was time to halt the offensive. More images emerge like video stills: the slaughter on the causeway - \"hell's highway\" - the last exit for the Iraqis from the jaws of a giant trap.Though the desert campaign seemed an example of Murphy's Law reversed, its success was a result of meticulous planning and preparation. There is an army adage that sweat in training prevents blood in battle. Sweat moistens these pages: the sweat of mental exertion that produced one of the most perfectly executed campaigns in U.S. military history.In it, the 101st's heliborne blitzkrieg opened a new chapter of warfare as significant as the onslaught of the German panzers into Poland. The action reads as fast as the ground war itself, while the grueling build-up for \"G\" Day is replete with personal recollections of soldiers with much to prove and more at stake.Task Force Normandy's raid, for example, ranks historically with Doolittle's strike on Tokyo but followed two heartbreaking failures: the Son Tay raid to liberate POWs in Vietnam and the debacle of Desert One in Iran. Nothing less than America's military reputation rode with eight Apaches when they were the first to penetrate Iraq's air space.Lightning in the Storm is the first glimpse, from many angles, of the post-Vietnam army in combat - all volunteers and products of new age military thinking. And at the leading edge of this high tech army is the 101st, the only air assault (heliborne) division in the world. Their performance in the desert was truly awesome. So much so that they question whether they are authentically veterans, having lost so few lives in achieving victory so sudden and total it has left them bemused.However the gulf war will be viewed in the annals of history, an illuminating picture will be found in this book of the most futuristic force to sweep over a desert.",

So why do many Christians feel disappointed and disillusioned with their efforts to experience authentic community? Despite the best efforts of pastors, small group leaders, and faithful lay persons, church too often is a place of loneliness rather than connection. Church can be so much better. So intimate and alive. The Connecting Church tells you how. The answer may seem radical today, but it was a central component of life in the early church. First-century Christians knew what it meant to live in vital community with one another, relating with a depth and commitment that made 'the body of Christ' a perfect metaphor for the church. What would it take to reclaim that kind of love, joy, support, and dynamic spiritual growth? Read this book and find out.",

While Washington offers only the politics of blame and fear, Jim Wallis, the man who changed the conversation about faith and politics, has traveled the country and found a nation hungry for a politics of solutions and hope. He shows us that a revival is happening, as people of faith and moral conviction seek common ground for change. Wallis also reminds us that religious faith was a driving force behind our greatest national reforms, such as the abolition of slavery and the civil rights movement. These \"great awakenings\" happened periodically at crucial times in our nation's history to propel us toward the common good. The time is ripe for another movement that will transform this country. With The Great Awakening, Wallis helps us rediscover our moral center and provides both the needed inspiration and a concrete plan to hold politics accountable and find solutions to our greatest challenges.",

        "Description": "In recent years the Supreme Court has been at the center of such political issues as abortion rights, the administration of police procedures, and the determination of the 2000 presidential election. The checks and balances provided by the three branches of federal government are essential to nurturing and maintaining American democracy. With the guidance of coeditors Kermit L. Hall and Kevin T. McGuire, this volume of essays examines the role of the Judicial Branch in American democracy and the dynamic between the other branches of government, compares international models, and discusses possible measures for reform. The Judicial Branch considers the impact of courts on American life and addresses such central questions as: Is the Supreme Court an institution of social justice? Is there a case for judicially created and protected social rights? Have the courts become sovereign when interpreting the Constitution?  Essays examine topics that include the judiciary in the founding of the nation; turning points in the history of the American judicial system; the separation of powers between the other branches of government; how the Supreme Court resolves political conflicts through legal means; what Americans know about the judiciary and its functions; and whether the American scheme of courts is the best way to support democracy.",

Scott Fitzgerald, Gore Vidal, and Tennessee Williams. These eighteen profiles, some of which first appeared in The New York Review of Books and The New York Times Book Review, show the critical insights of a celebrated writer best known for his fiction but equally astute in examining \"The Two Marcels of Proust,\" peeling away longstanding misconceptions about Edith Wharton's early development as a writer, and exploring \"Aestheticism and Homosexuality\" in Oscar Wilde and Walter Pater.Auchincloss explores the creative tension between style and substance, between fiction and life. His own style is always witty, elegant, and thoroughly engaging. Not afraid to speak his mind, he never minces words, as when he writes about Tennessee Williams, \"His heroes and heroines are sexual impulses, his plots a kind of sexual intercourse.\"The Style's the Man not only illuminates the master stylists in literature but equally demonstrates Louis Auchincloss's own wide-ranging interests, incisive intelligence, and taste cultivated over a long and distinguished career. Here he offers up a literary feast for book lovers and students alike.",

Ira Chaleff\u2019s Courageous Follower model has facilitated healthy upward information flow in organizations for over 15 years. The Harvard Business Review called Chaleff a pioneer in the emerging field of followership\u2014this new edition shares his latest thinking on an increasingly vital topic. The updated third edition includes a new chapter, \u201cThe Courage to Speak to the Hierarchy.\u201d Much of Chaleff\u2019s model is based on followers having access to the leader. But today, followers can be handed questionable policies and orders that come from many levels above them\u2014even from the other side of the world. Chaleff explores how they can respond effectively, particularly using the power now available through advances in communications technology. Everyone is a follower at least some of the time. Chaleff strips away the passive connotations of that role and provides tools to help followers effectively partner with leaders. He provides rich guidance to leaders and boards on fostering a climate that encourages courageous followership. The results include increased support for leaders, reduced cynicism and organizations saved from serious missteps.",

Forensics professor Gideon Oliver accompanies his wife to the Isles of Scilly, which dot the sea like an emerald necklace thirty miles off the Cornwall coast. Julie's been invited here by Russian expatriate Vasily Kozlov, scientist, millionaire, and eccentric. At his home, Star Castle, he regularly hosts a consortium of guests with differing opinions-which makes for some very heated arguments.  While Julie's stuck indoors, Gideon looks forward to puttering around the Neolithic sites nearby. But before day one is through, a newer bone turns up-this tibia is only a few years old-and all signs point to murder. And just as Gideon and the local law puzzle over the bone's origin, another murder happens at Star Castle. Could it just be bad luck, two murders within a couple of years? Or do Kozlov's lively debates have a way of turning deadly?",

America is divided right down the middle - the product of a half-century, unique in our country's history, of inconclusive, increasingly heated partisan battle.  Tantalizingly close to victory, each party inflames and mobilizes its most loyal supporters and battles to gain even a small edge with some contested groups.  Politics has become culture war - a fight about values, faith, the family, how people should live their lives.  The result: partisans are more partisan, politics more polarized, America more divided.The Two Americas: Our Current Political Deadlock and How to Break It tells the history of each party's failed efforts to dominate the era's politics and ideas, radically changing the political landscape.  The book provides an in-depth guide to the new groups at the center of our politics.  Internationally renowned political strategist and pollster Stanley Greenberg puts the reader in the room with the strategists and politicians and shows how each party can win, even shatter the impasse.The Two Americas is a political primer and strategic playbook for this unique era - essential reading for any armchair political strategist or engaged citizen eager to understand our future politics.",

        "Description": "Behind the gold curtains of the Metropolitan Opera House, amidst the elaborate sets, bejeweled costumes, and labyrinth of administrative offices, the Met has traditionally operated in great secrecy.  Until now.Johanna Fiedler, who was the Met\u2019s general press representative for fifteen years, draws upon her insider\u2019s knowledge and rivetingly reveals for the first time the company\u2019s Byzantine inner workings and the personal, social, economic, and artistic struggles that have always characterized the Met.Molto Agitato is a tale with an appropriately operatic cast of characters_haughty blue bloods, ambitious social climbers, determined administrators, stubborn board members, temperamental artists_all maneuvering to use their power and influence to make the Met conform to their own agendas.  Fiedler brings to life the early days of the Met, with the imperious Toscanini arriving from Italy and Caruso filling the house; the post-WW II years, when the unions gained strength and plagued the company with strikes; and the ever present passions of tenors and sopranos, clashing offstage as well as on.  But most revelatory are Fiedler\u2019s portrayals of James Levine and Joseph Volpe and their practically parallel ascendancies_Levine rising from prodigy to artistic director, Volpe advancing from stagehand to general manager_and their once strained relationship that was compounded by Volpe\u2019s much publicized firing of the soprano Kathleen Battle.With its swift-flowing narrative, Molto Agitato is a wonderfully entertaining and thoroughly engaging account not only of one of the world\u2019s most respected and richest music institutions but also of power, politics, ambition, and egos.",

        "Title": "Pitch Like a Girl: How a Woman Can Be Herself and Still Succeed",
        "Authors": "By Lichtenberg, Ronna",
        "Description": "Shelves full of business books have told women that the only way to win at work is to be like a guy. The truth is that science shows that the brains of men and women work differently. Here are proven techniques to maximize the intrinsic and instinctive strengths of women for the workplace.Despite steady advancement, part of the reason for women's continuing struggle for success is a very personal challenge: They feel uncomfortable doing anything that feels like self-promotion.That's why Ronna Lichtenberg, corporate veteran turned highly sought-after management consultant, built a program for women that works with their unique advantages.Starting with recent developments in brain sex research and moving through social stereotypes, Lichtenberg takes a fresh look at how women relate to work and shows them how to use their gifts to get what they want. The book includes easy-to-use tools, tips on managing communication styles, and exercises that have been honed in Lichtenberg's many workshops.Whether giving women pragmatic advice on what to do about that infuriating boss, how to know how much money they should be making (and how to get it), or how to follow up without feeling like a beggar or a stalker, Lichtenberg is real, and really funny at the same time. Her advice ushers in a new world of possibilities for women who are ready for a success that feels right.",

To celebrate her plunge into world prominence and popularity, we give you The Ultimate Barbra.  This book is an intriguing compilation of information and lore about this multi-talented and phenomenal star, with a special presentation of the people, places, and events of her headline-making life and career to date. The Ultimate Barbra is a unique, comprehensive volume and is unlike any other book to date on Ms. Streisand. It is an entertaining, bold compendium of test-your-knowledge quizzes, lists, directories of people and places, chronologies, trivia challenges, special appendices (including bibliographies, Web sites and fan club listings), and more. All aspects of her phenomenal talent are covered: her career on stage, film, TV, and in the recording studios; her love life which has ranged from Elvis Presley to Elliott Gould to Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau to Don Johnson to current husband James Brolin, being a mother, and her offstage activities in the arenas of philanthropy, politics, and environmentalism.This book is an informative and clever look at the richly textured life and career of the superstar who offends almost as many people as she delights. Readers and fans may be familiar with the details of her much-chronicled life, but they have not seen them presented in such an unusual and intriguing way as offered in The Ultimate Barbra.",

It is a funny, eye-opening, brow-sweating investigation into the fads, fictions, and science of fitness training. From the early days of jogging, championed by Jim Fixx\u2014 who later died of a heart attack\u2014to weight lifting, cycling, aerobics, and Spinning, Kolata questions such popular notions as the \u201cfat-burning zone\u201d and \u201cspot reducing,\u201d the effects of food on performance, how much exercise helps build fitness, and the difference between exercise to help the heart and exercise to change the body. She explains the science of physical fitness and the objective evidence behind commonly accepted prescriptions. Along the way she profiles researchers and mavericks who have challenged conventional wisdom, marketed their inventions, and sometimes bucked criticism only to back down from their original claims.  Ultimate Fitness  spotlights the machines and machinations of the fitness industry, and cuts through the marketing and hype not only to assess what is healthy, but also to understand what our obsession with staying healthy says about American culture today.",

        "Title": "Reclaiming Conservatism: How a Great American Political Movement Got Lost--And How It Can Find Its Way Back",
        "Authors": "By Edwards, Mickey",
        "Description": "A leading figure in the American conservative movement for over 40 years, Mickey Edwards was a prominent Republican congressman, a former national chairman of the American Conservative Union, and a founding trustee of the Heritage Foundation. When he speaks, conservatives listen.      Now, in this highly provocative and frank volume, Edwards argues loud and clear that conservatives today have abandoned their principles and have become champions of that which they once most feared. The conservative movement--which once nominated Barry Goldwater for President, and later elected Ronald Reagan--was based on a distinctly American kind of conservatism which drew its inspiration directly from the United States Constitution--in particular, an overriding belief in individual liberty and limited government.  But today, Edwards argues, the mantle of conservatism has been taken over by people whose beliefs and policies threaten the entire constitutional system of government. By abetting an imperial presidency, he contends, so-called \"conservatives\" have gutted the system of checks and balances, abandoned due process, and trampled upon our cherished civil liberties. Today's conservatives endorse unprecedented assertions of government power--from the creation of secret prisons to illegal wiretapping.  Once, they fought to protect citizens from government intrusion; today, they seem to recognize few limits on what government can do.  The movement that was once the Constitution's--and freedom's--strongest defender is now at risk of becoming its most dangerous enemy. Edwards ends with a blueprint for reclaiming the essence of conservatism in America.    Touching upon many current issues, this passionately argued book concludes that many of today's conservatives seem to have it all backwards.  They have turned conservatism upside down--and this book calls them on it.",

        "Description": "Tough Times Call for Tough ActionIn American Grit, nationally syndicated columnist Tony Blankley warns that the administration of Barack Obama is a potential disaster at a dangerous time for America. Challenging Americans to recapture the spirit of sacrifice that has historically characterized our nation, Blankley demonstrates how Obama's agenda, with its emphasis on environmental sensitivity, military retreat, and the diminution of executive branch powers, promotes national weakness as a righteous ideal. In contrast, Blankley puts forward his own nationalist program based on toughness, resoluteness, and grit--traditional American values totally absent from Obama's agenda. In this passionate, hard-hitting book, Blankley shows:* How Obama's plan for national service is a weak substitute for what America really needs--a full-on military draft* How Obama's infatuation with alternative energy will damage America's national interests* Why we need stricter laws to prevent the media from compromising our national security* Why the office of the presidency, contrary to popular belief, has not gained enough power since the September 11 attacks* How we can craft a successful foreign policy that avoids the mistakes of both the liberals and the neo-cons* How our war effort in Iraq was undermined by effective enemy propaganda--and what we can do about it* Why education reform under President Obama will fail to address one of the biggest problems in our education system: the failure to teach patriotism Filled with solutions to problems ranging from the detention of enemy combatants to dealing with aggressive petro-states like Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, American Grit demonstrates how this country can emerge from its current domestic and military challenges as a stronger, more unified, and more tenacious nation--and why under President Obama, it won't.",

        "Description": "In Life Without Limits, Bassett asks, \"If you could have, do, and be anything right now, what would you ask for?\" Eight out of ten people are unable to answer this simple question.How about you? Do you know how to get what you want? Do you even know what you want? What do you see when you look in the mirror? A self-confident, radiant person who is living life to the fullest? Or do you see a frustrated, insecure, dissatisfied person who doesn't know how to change things? Bassett says, \"In my work, I am continually amazed at the number of people who are personally, professionally, and financially frustrated. But the worst part is, if they could change things, they aren't sure how, or even what they would change.\" People stop dreaming, settling for a life that is neither satisfying nor rewarding because their fears and insecurities prevent them from seeing what they want in life, and how to get it. Acquiring happiness, wealth, or success on any level is difficult when you aren't clear about what you want and you don't have a plan. Before you know it, years pass by, and you're looking back with regrets.\"In my work over the past fourteen years, I have encountered two types of people. The first group is the \"doers.\" They are the movers and the shakers. They plan their life and are strongly motivated. They are on a clear path, know exactly what they want, and they are willing to take the risks to get it. The second group is the \"drifters.\" They drift through life with no real sense of direction, ending up frustrated. This can happen to people in the most prestigious occupations.
