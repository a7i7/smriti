        "Description": "Italy: A Short History succeeds and replaces the long-established and highly successful Short History of Italy, edited by Professors Hearder and D. P. Waley. It presents a clear and concise account of the principal developments in Italian history from the Ice Age to the present day, intended both for student of Italian history and culture and the general reader with an interest in Italian affairs. Professor Hearder's account centres on the main political developments, placed in their appropriate economic and social context, and shows how these were related to the great moments of artistic and cultural endeavour. Professor Hearder traces the prehistoric and classical history of the peninsula, the growth and decline of the Roman Empire and the expansion in power and authority of the medieval papacy. He shows how the remarkable cultural achievements of the Renaissance emerged from the horror of the Plague, and how the spread of humanism and the development of printing made Italy the cultural heart of Europe. There then followed, however, a long period of domination from without, culminating in the brief episode of Napoleonic rule. This was only ended with the emergence of the great nineteenth-century movement for national renewal, inspired by the contrasting figures of Mazzini, Cavour and Garibaldi. The newly-democratic Italian kingdom survived the First World War, only to be taken over by the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. Professor Hearder examines the travails and contradictions of the Fascist period, and concludes his account with an optimistic assessment of the future prospects of the Republic, capable of contributing much to the rejuvenated Europe of 1992 and beyond.",

As he reminisces and writes, placing the pages carefully in his antproof case, we learn that he was a World War II ace who was shot down twice, an investment banker who met with popes and presidents, and a man who was never not in love.

Like a character from one of her favorite novels, Alice holds a biting, eccentric, but expansive view of life; she wears only white, has a stutter, and knows her peers call her a madwoman in the attic. Various period cures-hydrotherapy, hypnotherapy, electrotherapy, a sanitarium-fail to turn this thirty-two-year-old, highly imaginative, caustically funny woman into one of the silly damsels of 1903's New York Society. Hauntingly, beneath all this lies a dark family secret.Pinkerton's Sister is a novel for readers, who will thrill to recognize a kindred in Alice's references to our most beloved literary characters: Jo March, Jane Eyre, Leo Bloom, and Hester Prynne, among many others, grace these pages. This intertextual, playful work certainly qualifies as \"the ultimate book-geek's guilty pleasure\" (Creative Loafing Atlanta).",

Circling around Mr. Reynaud's educational oasis are parents coping with losing their homes and trying to plan new futures, while learning to live on food stamps and FEMA assistance checks. It's a story of an unexpected journey to Cajun country for a classroom of children who are among the youngest victims of a national disaster.Sugarcane Academy also tells the stories of other evacuee children who landed in the Lafayette area. A boy born of Ukranian parents who holed up in a New Orleans medical center for four days after the hurricane, telling his mother he couldn't stop thinking about death. An ad-hoc tutoring room set up in the Cajundome, one of the sports arenas-turned-massive shelters that line Interstate 10 from Baton Rouge through Texas. There, counselors are using art and play to help children who witnessed tragedies, who lost family members. Through memoir, essay and reporting, the book will also reveal how race and class issues factor in both education and a natural disaster. We are still understanding how Katrina tore into the lives of children. Sugarcane Academy will profile one remarkable teacher and a group of children as they persevere through the storm's aftermath. It will also show that, even under the most difficult of circumstances, you can still find moments of sweetness.",

But what began then as an apprenticeship at La Varenne \u00c9cole de Cuisine evolved into a lifelong immersion in French cuisine and culture, culminating in permanent residency in 1994. On Rue Tatin chronicles her journey to an ancient little street in Louviers, one of Normandy\u2019s most picturesque towns. With lyrical prose and wry candor, Loomis recalls the miraculous restoration that she and her husband performed on the dilapidated convent they chose for their new residence. As its ochre and azure floor tiles emerged, challenges outside the dwelling mounted. From squatters to a surly priest next door, along with a close-knit community wary of outsiders, Loomis tackled the social challenges head-on, through persistent dialogue\u2013and baking. On Rue Tatin includes delicious recipes that evoke the essence of this region, such as Apple and Thyme Tart, Duck Breast with Cider, and Braised Chicken in White Wine and Mustard. Transporting readers to a world where tradition is cherished, On Rue Tatin provides a touching glimpse of the camaraderie, exquisite food, and simple pleasures of daily life in a truly glorious corner of Normandy.",

In a revelatory look at our nation\u2019s birth, Forrest Church re-creates our first great culture war\u2014a tumultuous, nearly forgotten conflict that raged from George Washington\u2019s presidency to James Monroe\u2019s.\u00a0 Religion was the most divisive issue in the nation\u2019s early presidential elections.\u00a0Battles raged over numerous issues while the bible and the Declaration of Independence competed for American\u00a0affections.\u00a0The religous political wars reached a vicious peak during the War of 1812; the American victory drove New England's Christian right to withdraw from electoral politics, thereby shaping our modern sense of church-state separation. No longer entangled, both church and state flourished.Forrest Church has written a rich, page-turning history, a new vision of our earliest presidents\u2019 beliefs that stands as a reminder and a warning for America today.",

But Michaels is after darker thrills than sex. When he turns nasty and Finch begins to struggle, it's over fast.Paris Murphy, in bed with the husband she can't live with and can't live without, is called to the brutal murder scene. She knows Finch's beat and knows her story: a farm girl who was a beauty queen at fifteen, and at twenty-three a worn-out hooker desperate to leave the life. Sad for Finch, appalled by her terrible end, Paris is determined to find her murderer.Paris likes to work alone - her intuition helps her solve cases, and she likes to move on hunches without advice or interference. When the heat on this case means that she must have a partner, she chooses Gabriel Nash, a veteran detective whom she trusts with her life, though she doesn't let him dissuade her from walking Finch's beat dressed as a hooker. That gig doesn't attract the murderer, but at Finch's funeral Paris zeroes in on a suspect. Then other women are found murdered, their bodies defaced with the \"signature\" of Finch's killer, and Paris uncovers a connection to earlier unsolved crimes. Gabe tries, and fails, to hold her back as she throws herself headlong into the path of the psychopath who wants to have her - and then kill her.",

You hate counting calories and carbs and fat grams. You're sick of the pressure to work out three times a week. Bottom line: You're tired of feeling fat.But here's the thing: Fat is not a feeling. Happy, angry, sad -- those are feelings. When you say you feel fat, chances are you mean something else. And when you ask someone if you look fat, you're probably asking, \"Am I good enough?\"Whether you're a size 2, 12, or 22, it's considered normal to hate your body. Society practically encourages it. But this discontent is really just a way of masking deeper issues such as insecurity, low self-esteem, or a longing for love and acceptance. By focusing on what others tell you are your shortcomings, you miss countless opportunities to feel connected, sexy, and powerful.Do I Look Fat in This? brings good news: Life doesn't begin five pounds from now. In this book, acclaimed author and speaker Jessica Weiner provides real solutions to real problems, from surviving a closet meltdown when you can't find anything to wear, to how to cope with being bombarded by images of perfect-looking models.With quizzes, guides, tools, and tips, Do I Look Fat in This? offers a step-by-step plan for creating a more fulfilling and positive life.

It reads like a novel, but it is one of the most important scientific works ever published. The community is Gombe, on the shores of Lake Tangganyika, where the principal residents are chimpanzees and one extraordinary woman who is their student, protector, and historian.  In her classic In the Shadow of Man, Jane Goodall wrote of her first ten years at Gombe.  In Through a Window she brings the story up to the present, painting a much more complete and vivid portrait of our closest relative.  We see the community split in two and a brutal war break out.  We watch young Figan's relentless rise to power and old Mike's crushing defeat.  We learn how one mother rears her children to succeed and another dooms them to failure.  We witness horrifying murders, touching moments of affection, joyous births, and wrenching deaths.  In short, we see every emotion known to humans stripped to its essence.  In the mirror of chimpanzee life, we see ourselves reflected. Perhaps the best book ever written about animal behavior, Through a Window is also essential reading for anyone seeking a better grasp of human behavior.",

        "Description": "George W., this one's for you. In Washington Times correspondent Sammon's inside account of the Bush administration's reaction to 9-11 and the resultant war on terror, readers are tendered a breathless, highly complimentary portrait of the president and an overly simplistic moral tale about the great merit and unwavering moral vision of his inner circle. What could be an extremely interesting if one-sided account is often undercut by Sammon's penchant for editorializing (Bush was \"more directly affected than most Americans by the attacks themselves\"; Osama bin Laden \"giggled\" when speaking about the attacks; and the president often \"twinkles\" when he speaks) and novelizing (Bush \"never thought he would be so relieved to see the White House again. He scanned the magnificent curve of the South Portico...He gazed at the Rose Garden\"). Nor does Sammon seem to appreciate the irony of quoting some of the president's less eloquent statements, such as: \"The role of a president is to seek great objectives for the country, big goals.\" Sammon, author of the bestselling At Any Cost, largely writes for the converted, so the intended audience for this volume will no doubt love it. Those more skeptical of the government's policies, however, will find his narrative more hagiography than history, and will want to wait for Bob Woodward's forthcoming Bush at War, which covers the same territory from a different angle.",

        "Description": "Fawaz Gerges is one of this country's leading scholars of and media commentators on the Middle Eastern. Starting in the late 1990s, Gerges went to Cairo on a McArthur Fellowship, to interview (Arabic is his first language) those involved in the Jihadist Movement, which had begun in the 1970s as a fight against the secularization of Arab countries, hence was national rather than international in scope. But events--the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Iranian Revolution, war in Iraq\u2014began to extend its influence. The new Jihadists were not looking now merely to affect local but worldwide change. In Cairo, Fawaz began a long series of conversations with Kamal al-Said Habib was one of the founders of the modern Jihadist movement and one of its key spokesman. Habib had been jailed after Anwar Sadat\u2019s assassination\u2014organized by the Jihadist Movement\u2014and then become allied with Osama bin Laden\u2019s fringe group, which he subsequently renounced, before the 9-11 attacks. Habib\u2019s life-story emerges as a counterpart to those events and forms the basis of this book. JOURNEY OF A JIHADIST gives readers a look at religious extremism from the inside\u2014from the point of view of someone who founded, shaped, and changed with a movement. The Koran uses \"jihad\" figuratively to refer to humanity's lifelong struggle with the dictates of faith. This book gives us Habib\u2019s quest, among others, personalizing issues that would otherwise seem inexplicable. It also gives us Fawaz Gerges\u2019 quest. Gerges family was forced out of Lebanon by Muslim extremists during the Civil War, and his brother\u2014a Lebanese army officer\u2014was killed in fighting. He offers a gripping, accessible, even visceral account of the force with which we have been dealing since 9-11 and its aftermath, but which still seems so alien to most Americans.",

But when the ballots are counted, more than 70 percent are blank. The citizens are rebellious. A state of emergency is declared. But are the authorities acting too precipitously? Or even blindly?

But all their ideas, arguments, and compromises\u2014from the creation of the Constitution itself, article by article, to the insistence that it remain a living, evolving document\u2014laid the foundation for a government that has surpassed the founders' greatest hopes. Revisiting all the original historical documents of the period and drawing from her deep knowledge of eighteenth-century politics, Carol Berkin opens up the hearts and minds of America's founders, revealing the issues they faced, the times they lived in, and their humble expectations of success.",

        "Title": "A Time for War: The United States and Vietnam, 1941-1975",
        "Authors": "By Schulzinger, Robert D.",
        "Description": "\"...Schultzinger takes a fresh look at the Vietnam War by drawing on newly-opened archival materials and utilizing the already extensive bibliography on the war.  His narrative is free from the passions of the day which continue to influence the works of many scholars.\"--BookReviews Even after two decades, the memory of the Vietnam War seems to haunt our culture. From Forrest Gump to Miss Saigon, from Tim O'Brien's Pulitzer Prize-winning Going After Cacciato to Robert McNamara's controversial memoir In Retrospect, Americans are drawn again and again to ponder our long, tragic involvement in Southeast Asia. Now eminent historian Robert D. Schulzinger has combed the newly available documentary evidence, both in public and private archives, to produce an ambitious, masterful account of three decades of war in Vietnam--the first major full-length history of the conflict to be based on primary sources.        In A Time for War, Schulzinger paints a vast yet intricate canvas of more than three decades of conflict in Vietnam, from the first rumblings of rebellion against the French colonialists to the American intervention and eventual withdrawal. His comprehensive narrative incorporates every aspect of the war--from the military (as seen in his brisk account of the French failure at Dienbienphu) to the economic (such as the wage increase sparked by the draft in the United States) to the political. Drawing on massive research, he offers a vivid and insightful portrait of the changes in Vietnamese politics and society, from the rise of Ho Chi Minh, to the division of the country, to the struggles between South Vietnamese president Diem and heavily armed religious sects, to the infighting and corruption that plagued Saigon. Schulzinger reveals precisely how outside powers--first the French, then the Americans--committed themselves to war in Indochina, even against their own better judgment. Roosevelt, for example, derided the French efforts to reassert their colonial control after World War II, yet Truman, Eisenhower, and their advisers gradually came to believe that Vietnam was central to American interests. The author's account of Johnson is particularly telling and tragic, describing how president would voice clear headed, even prescient warnings about the dangers of intervention--then change his mind, committing America's prestige and military might to supporting a corrupt, unpopular regime. Schulzinger offers sharp criticism of the American military effort, and offers a fascinating look inside the Nixon White House, showing how the Republican president dragged out the war long past the point when he realized that the United States could not win. Finally, Schulzinger paints a brilliant political and social portrait of the times, illuminating the impact of the war on the lives of ordinary Americans and Vietnamese. Schulzinger shows what it was like to participate in the war--as a common soldier, an American nurse, a navy flyer, a conscript in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, a Vietcong fighter, or an antiwar protester.        In a field crowded with fiction, memoirs, and popular tracts, A Time for War will stand as the landmark history of America's longest war.  Based on extensive archival research, it will be the first place readers will turn in an effort to understand this tragic, divisive conflict.",
