In Pontiac, Pioneers, La Salle and Montcalm and Wolfe, Parkman, more than anyone else, first grasped the tragic element implicit in our pioneer heritage and placed the opening up of the great North American wilderness in broad historical perspective.Handsome, brilliant, courageous, Parkman drove himself relentlessly. The result was a severe breakdown in his twenties, complicated in later years by other illnesses. This interpretative biography chronicles his triumph over these setbacks and sheds new light on the impressive histories that seem to become ever more contemporary with the passage of time.",

But Navajo Tribal policeman Jim Chee and his mentor, Joe Leaphorn, discover an even deadlier killer stalking the reservation in the most chilling and beautifully crafted novel yet from the beloved and bestselling master of Southwestern suspense.  When Acting Lt. Chee catches  a Hopi eagle poacher literally red-handed--huddled over the bloody body of a young Navajo Tribal police officer--he has an open-and-shut case. Even the Feds--usually at odds with Chee&#39;agree, and it seems the Hopi is headed for the gas chamber.  Until Joe Leaphorn shows up to blow Chee&#39;s case wide open. Leaphorn, now retired form the Navajo Tribal Police, has been hired to find Cathy Pollard, a hot-headed biologist who disappeared from the same remote area on the same day the Navajo cop was murdered. Is she a suspect? A victim? And what are Chee and Leaphorn to make of the report that a skinwalker--a Navajo witch--was seen in the same area at the same time?  To answer these questions, Leaphorn and Chee must immerse themselves in the enigmatic web of scientists hunting the key to the most virulent form of bubonic plague since the Middle Ages.  In addition to its finely wrought plot, The First Eagle offers a wealth of Tony Hillerman&#39;s signature gifts--glorious evocations of the high desert, delicately drawn characters, and eloquent insights into the foibles and wisdom of the Southwest&#39;s native people.",

        "Description": "The Nazi siege of Leningrad from 1941 to 1943, during which time the city was cut off from the rest of the world, was one of the most gruesome episodes of World War II. In scale, the tragedy of Leningrad dwarfs even the Warsaw ghetto or Hiroshima. Nearly three million people endured it; just under half of them died, starving or freezing to death, most in the six months from October 1941 to April 1942 when the temperature often stayed at 30 degrees below zero. For twenty-five years the distinguished journalist and historian Harrison Salisbury has assembled material for this story. He has interviewed survivors, sifted through the Russian archives, and drawn on his vast experience as a correspondent in the Soviet Union. What he has discovered and imparted in The 900 Days is an epic narrative of villainy and survival, in which the city had as much to fear from Stalin as from Hitler. He concludes his story with the culminating disaster of the Leningrad Affair, a plot hatched by Stalin three years after the war had ended. Almost every official who had been instrumental in the city\u2019s survival was implicated, convicted, and executed. Harrison Salisbury has told this overwhelming story boldly, unforgettably, and definitively.",

Yet few know the richly varied private life that lies behind this icon, whose statuesque height and warmly enthused warble have become synonymous with the art of cooking.In this biography we meet the earthy and outrageous Julia, who, at age eighty-five, remains a complex role model. Fitch, who had access to all of Julia's private letters and diaries, takes us through her life, from her exuberant youth as a high-spirited California girl to her years at Smith College, where she was at the center of every prank and party. When most of her girlfriends married, Julia volunteered with the OSS in India and China during World War II, and was an integral part of this elite corps. There she met her future husband, the cosmopolitan Paul Child, who introduced her to the glories of art, fine French cuisine, and love. Theirs was a deeply passionate romance and a modern marriage of equals.Julia began her culinary training only at the age of thirty-seven at the Cordon Bleu. Later she roamed the food markets of Marseilles, Bonn, and Oslo. She invested ten years of learning and experimentation in what would become her first bestselling classic, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Now, her career is legend, spanning nearly forty years and still going strong. Generations love the humor and trademark aplomb that have made Julia a household name. Resisting fads and narrow, fanatical conventions of health-consciousness, Julia is the quintessential teacher. The perfect gift for food lovers and a romantic biography of a woman modern before her time, this is a truly American life.",

        "Description": "In my own time and in my own life, I have witnessed a revolution. Sandra Day O'Connor Meet the women of the revolution. The women ofThe Counselors have faced overwhelming opposition with astounding determination and integrity. Each believe in helping other women, and each of them has a host of experiences and advice from which younger women may learn valuable lessons of courage and strength. These are the women who have paved the way for the success of future generations. Author Elizabeth Vrato asked recipients of the prestigious Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award what they would like to share with young women just beginning their careers. The result of these conversations is a profound look at women's struggle for recognition and success that will captivate a reader of any age or gender. InThe Counselors, Janet Reno shares the story of her relationship with her brave mother, who built their log home with her own hands. Ruth Bader Ginsburg explains her crusade to change the laws of the United States to truly make them equal for men and women. We learn that Sandra Day O'Connor was unable to find a job as a lawyer upon her graduation at the top of her class at Stanford -- the only jobs that were offered to her were those of legal secretary -- and of her eventual ascent to the Supreme Court of the United States. In his foreword, Bill Clinton writes, \"Just as the women in this book were empowered by the efforts and example of those who came before them, a new generation will be inspired and encouraged by the spirit and achievements of this remarkable group.\" With wisdom and insight on every page, The Counselors is a penetrating reminder of the power of the human spirit and of the strength and triumph of some of this century's most amazing women. It is an invaluable resource for women and men of every generation.",

The result, paradoxically, is an intimately readable account of a man thrust forward by the visions he receives, the sermons he offers, and the miracles he enacts until he comes to the apocalyptic end of his powers.The Gospel According to the Son, while adhering closely to the New Testament, also succeeds in vividly re-creating the world of Galilee and Jerusalem two thousand years ago. In a time of uneasy stability, the Holy Land is governed by a complacent but fearful establishment who rule over a despairing underclass - it is a time of great change, open to comparison with our own. Mailer's signal accomplishment is to create for us a man wholly unlike others who is nonetheless filled with passion and doubt, strength and weakness; a protagonist divine and human, a son of God who shares our condition.",

        "Description": "The One to One Future revolutionized marketing when it was first published. Then considered a radical rethinking of marketing basics, this bestselling book has become today's bible for marketers. Now finally available in paperback, this completely revised and updated edition--with an all-new User's Guide--takes readers step-by-step through the latest strategies needed for any business to compete, and succeed, in the Interactive Age.Most businesses follow time-honored mass-marketing rules of pitching their products to the greatest number of people. However, selling more goods to fewer people is not only more efficient but far more profitable. The One to One Future is a radically innovative business paradigm focusing on the share of customer--one customer at a time--rather than just the share of market.Authors Don Peppers and Martha Rogers reveal one to one strategies to: * Find the 20 percent--or 2 percent--of your own customers and prospects who are the most loyal and who offer the biggest opportunities for future profit;* Collaborate with each customer, one at a time, just as you now work with individual suppliers or marketing partners;* Nurture your relationships with each customer by relying on new one to one media vehicles--not just the mail, but the fax machine, the touch-tone phone, voice mail, cell phones, and interactive television.Leading-edge companies such as MCI, Lexus, Levi Strauss, and Nissan Canada, and thousands of smaller enterprises, have already adopted the one-to-one perspective. The strategies outlined in this book work just as well--often even better--for small companies, from two-person accounting firms to flower shops to furniture stores.",

The news strikes Greenwich society like a thunderbolt - as does the news that Molly Carpenter Lasch, the beautiful young wife of the slain doctor, has been arrested for her husband's murder.Nobody believes Molly's claim to have no memory of the events of the night of the crime - not her parents, not her friends, not even her own lawyer - and evidence against her is overwhelming. To escape an inevitable murder conviction, she accepts a plea bargain, and subsequently her lawyer wins her early parole.A few years later, on Molly's release from prison, she reasserts her innocence in front of TV cameras and reporters gathered at the prison gate. Among them is an old acquaintance and schoolmate, Fran Simmons, currently working as investigative reporter for the True Crime television series.Determined to prove her innocence, Molly convinces Fran to research and present a program on Gary's death. Despite her skepticism, Fran agrees to go ahead.Fran, intent on assuaging Molly's doubts about her husband's death and her own gnawing questions about her father's suicide, soon finds herself enmeshed in a tangled web of intrigue and menace - more deaths and more unanswered questions about Gary Lasch's murder.",

In Jack Higgins's acclaimed bestseller Dark Justice, intelligence operative Sean Dillon and his colleagues in Britain and the United States beat back a terrible enemy, but at an equally terrible cost. One of them was shot, another run down in the street. Both were expected to survive-but only one of them does.  As Detective Superintendent Hannah Bernstein of Special Branch lies recuperating in the hospital, a dark shadow from her and Dillon's past, scarred deep by hatred, steals across the room and finishes the job. Consumed by grief and rage, Dillon, Blake, Ferguson, and all who loved Hannah swear vengeance, no matter where it takes them. But they have no idea of the searing journey upon which they are about to embark-nor of the war that will change them all.  Filled with dark suspense, driven by characters of complexity and passion, Without Mercy once again proves that Jack Higgins is the dean of intrigue novelists.",

        "Description": "The publication of Listening to America coincides with the twenty-fifth anniversary of NPR's founding in 1970. Wertheimer, who was present at the creation, is ideally qualified to cull the best interviews and commentaries from each year. Her selections allow us to revisit the major news stories of our timeWatergate, the fall of Saigon, the Iran hostage crisis, the rise of Ronald Reagan, the AIDS epidemic. Here too are vivid illuminations of America's rich cultural life, as when Goodman Ace celebrates Groucho Marx, Vertamae Grosvenor reflects on the murder of John Lennon, and Red Barber meditates on the expression \"suck-egg mule.\" And superb pieces by Nina Totenberg, Susan Stamberg, Daniel Schorr, and Wertheimer herself remind us that NPR provides some of the country's most insightful reportage in any medium.Wertheimer links her selections with a lively commentary that puts each story in its historical context. She also provides much insight into the evolution of NPR: year by year, we see it grow from the nearly amateur operation it was at the outset to the professional, authoritative radio network it is today. And happily for NPR's legion of fans, this book rescues a trove of classic broadcasts from archival oblivion: John Henry Faulk's lament for our lost ideals, Robert Krulwich's hilarious profile of a coupon clippers' club, Neal Conan's account of his capture by Iraqi soldiers, and many others.",

Right after Christmas Eve service at Lord's Chapel, she and Gene will deliver a two-layer marmalade to each of seven friends and neighbors, all of them favorite Mitford characters. Then Gene calculates what it costs to bake this legendary cake, and Esther is stunned. Is it worth it to spend so much money on people who haven't always measured up to her expectations? The answer is clear. She'll cut her list back-way back.  This decision makes perfect sense until the lyrics of a Christmas carol steal into her heart, and help remind her what a gift really means.",

Kikue and Shino are certain they recognize his face as that of the bogus groom in the photograph used to deceive them. Even as the two women are scheming to buy their freedom from their pimp, Kato, they begin plotting their revenge against Arai with the help of Hana, a beautiful girl who may or may not be mad; the hapless farmer Kogoro Doi; and the unwitting Inadas, two zealous Christian converts.Face of a Stranger is a sly, farcical tale of dissembling, revenge, and mistaken identity.",

For this reason, there is no doubt that every teenager could use a little bit of encouragement, wisdom, support, advice, or even just a pat on the back, to let them know they're doing okay and that things will turn out just fine (they will, you know). Though the teen years may be a little less than perfect, to be a teenagers is to be one of the luckiest people in the entire universe (now that really is luck). This enormous world is filled with greatness and opportunity and possibility and a million other wonderful things, and for a teenager, that is an incredibly awesome fortune.Sometimes teenagers need to be reminded of all this greatness standing before them. With all the things going on in their very busy lives it really can be easy for them to forget. That's where this book comes in (you were probably wondering, right?). It is a great big pat on the back filled with words of confidence, support and inspiration to help any teen strive, thrive, and make this world everything they've ever dreamed it could be. And even better than that, it's the perfect reminder of how truly wonderful being a teenager can be (and that is something every teen should know).",
