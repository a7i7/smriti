        "Authors": "By National Gallery of Art (U. S.) (COR), Royal Academy of Arts (Great Britain) (COR), Martineau, Jane (EDT), and Robison, Andrew (EDT)",
        "Description": "Venice, home of Tiepolo, Canaletto, Piranesi, Piazzetta, and Guardi, was the most artistic city of eighteenth-century Italy. This beautiful book examines the whole range of the arts in Venice during this period, including paintings, pastels and gouaches, drawings and watercolours, prints and illustrated books and sculpture.The book begins with an introduction by Andrew Robison, and a general introduction to Venetian art by Michael Levey. Essays by other eminent authorities then discuss the international taste for Venetian art and major aspects of the art of the period. The essays are followed by a catalogue that discusses and reproduces many of the finest works of the time along with biographies and critical discussions of the artists. The selection of works emphasises the beauty, quality, distinctiveness, variety, balance, and unity of Venetian art. It includes altarpieces by Tiepolo, Piazzetta, and others that demonstrate the importance of profoundly serious and grand religious art; it presents the finest examples of history painting and allegory, views and landscapes, architectural fantasies, decorative paintings, and portraits; and it offers a large selection of particularly fine graphic art, for many of the greatest painters - Marco Ricci, Piazzetta, Canaletto, and Tiepolo - also devoted themselves to printmaking, book illustration, and designs for stage sets and the decorative arts, and often found greater freedom for their fantasy in such works.",

Her daughter, Trudy, was only three when she and her mother were liberated by an American soldier and went to live with him in Minnesota. Trudy's sole evidence of the past is an old photograph: a family portrait showing Anna, Trudy, and a Nazi officer, the Obersturmfuhrer of Buchenwald. Driven by the guilt of her heritage, Trudy, now a professor of German history, begins investigating the past and finally unearths the dramatic and heartbreaking truth of her mother's life. Combining a passionate, doomed love story, a vivid evocation of life during the war, and a poignant mother/daughter drama, Those Who Save Us is a profound exploration of what we endure to survive and the legacy of shame.",

        "Description": "From the best-selling author of Black Hawk Down comes a riveting, definitive chronicle of the Iran hostage crisis, America\u2019s first battle with militant Islam. On November 4, 1979, a group of radical Islamist students, inspired by the revolutionary Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini, stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran. They took fifty-two Americans hostage, and kept nearly all of them hostage for 444 days. In Guests of the Ayatollah, Mark Bowden tells this sweeping story through the eyes of the hostages, the soldiers in a new special forces unit sent to free them, their radical, na\u00efve captors, and the diplomats working to end the crisis. Bowden takes us inside the hostages\u2019 cells and inside the Oval Office for meetings with President Carter and his exhausted team. We travel to international capitals where shadowy figures held clandestine negotiations, and to the deserts of Iran, where a courageous, desperate attempt to rescue the hostages exploded into tragic failure. Bowden dedicated five years to this research, including numerous trips to Iran and countless interviews with those involved on both sides. Guests of the Ayatollah is a detailed, brilliantly re-created, and suspenseful account of a crisis that gripped and ultimately changed the world.",

Authors Ulrich, Zenger, and Smallwood--world-renowned experts in human resources and training--argue that it is not enough to gauge leaders by personal traits such as character, style, and values. Rather, effective leaders know how to connect these leadership attributes with results. Results-Based Leadership shows executives how to deliver results in four specific areas: results for employees, for the organization, for its customers, and for its investors. The authors provide action-oriented guidelines that readers can follow to develop and hone their own results-based leadership skills. By shifting our focus to the connection between the attributes and the results of leadership, this perceptive new guide fundamentally improves our understanding of effective leadership. Results-Based Leadership brings a refreshing clarity and directness to the leadership discussion, providing a hands-on program to help executives succeed with their leadership challenges.",

        "Authors": "By Reichs, Kathy",
        "Description": "Following the tremendous success of Cross Bones, Kathy Reichs explores another high-profile topic in Break No Bones -- a case that lands forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan in the middle of a gruesome international scheme.   Summoned to South Carolina to fill in for a negligent colleague, Tempe is stuck teaching a lackluster archaeology field school in the ruins of a Native American burial ground on the Charleston shore. But when Tempe stumbles upon a fresh skeleton among the ancient bones, her old friend Emma Rousseau, the local coroner, persuades her to stay on and help with the investigation. When Emma reveals a disturbing secret, it becomes more important than ever for Tempe to help her friend close the case.   The body count begins to climb. An unidentified man is found hanging from a tree deep in the woods. Another corpse shows up in a barrel. There are mysterious nicks on bones in several bodies, and signs of strangulation. Tempe follows the trail to a free street clinic with a belligerent staff, a suspicious doctor, and a donor who is a charismatic televangelist. Clues abound in the most unlikely places as Tempe uses her unique knowledge and skills to build her case, even as the local sheriff remains dubious and her own life is threatened.   Tempe's love life is also complicated. Ryan, her current flame, has come down to visit her from Montreal, and Pete, her former husband, is investigating the disappearance of a local woman -- and he and Tempe are staying in the same borrowed beach house. Ryan and Pete compete for her attentions, and Tempe finds herself more distracted by her feelings for both men than she expected.   Break No Bones is a smart, taut thriller featuring the kind of high-stakes crime that makes the headlines every week. Reichs, the inspiration for the hit FOX TV show Bones, is writing at the top of her form, and Tempe has never been more compelling.",

        "Description": "Salamis, Agincourt, Lepanto, Trafalgar, Gettysburg, Iswandlana, the Somme, Stalingrad--Battlefield: Decisive Conflicts in History tells the stories of the most dramatic, memorable, and important conflicts in world history. It begins with the battle of Megiddo in ancient Egypt in 1476 BC and takes the reader through to the Second Gulf War, covering almost 300 battles from around the world-- including the Middle East, Asia, Africa, as well as from Europe and the Americas.   This important book is edited by Richard Holmes, who has written over 20 books, including The Oxford Companion to Military History.  The battles are grouped within chapters that tell the wider story of a particular era or region, for instance the ancient world, nineteenth-century Europe, World War I, or the Americas. Each chapter includes an introduction by Richard Holmes that sets out the historical, tactical, and technological context, and looks at current debates. In addition, individual battles are placed clearly within the wars and campaigns of which they formed a part, making it possible for the reader to follow the details of the battle, and at the same time to understand its military and historical implications.  Detailed maps portray the course of famous battles and campaigns, and a range of illustrations--many from contemporary sources--bring the narrative to life. An extensive index gives the reader quick access to historical figures, locations, battle formations, and much more. Battlefield summarizes the best of contemporary scholarship on battles and war in an accessible, engaging narrative, and it will be of interest to anyone interested in military history.",

        "Description": "Tough Decisions presents many of the complex medical-ethical issues likely to confront practitioners in critical situations.  Through fictional but true-to-life cases, vividly described in clinical terms, the authors force the reader to choose among different courses of action and to confront a range of possible consequences.  A two-year-old has been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor.  Who should be allowed to make decisions about the child's surgery and subsequent therapy, and on what basis? A family history of Huntington's disease emerges when a fiancee seeks genetic counseling. Who should be informed? An elderly patient suffers a cardiac arrest.  Should \"do-not-resuscitate\" orders always be followed?  How should legal liability affect medical decisions?      Other ethical issues considered include surgical complications, patient autonomy, rights of the retarded, informed consent, euthanasia, and the fair allocation of finite resources.  Each case presented conveys the drama and pressure of weighing alternatives, and the realistic consequences of the choices made.  The authors show that ethical decision-making is not limited to \"matters of life and death\", and that it is not the decision but the ethical process by which it is made that gives the decision moral integrity.      With realistic detail, Tough Decisions brings to life and makes the student share in the many complexities of ethical decision-making when the health and lives of patients are at stake.",

Much of the information in this book is new, because many of the situations it discusses have not existed as social norms before.  Letitia Baldrige is uniquely qualified to offer this timely advice. Universally recognized as the country's leading authority on manners and social relationships, she has been hailed on the cover of Time magazine as \"America's leading arbiter of manners\" and is regularly celebrated for the same expertise in the media.  Ms. Baldrige's book provides authoritative answers to questions about manners no one has had to ask before. Among them, the protocol involved in all the new family relationships -- stepfamilies, adult children returning home, and elderly parents moving in; child visitation problems and other complications of divorce; the new codes concerning sex and dating and women taking the initiative romantically; and men and women traveling together on business. She provides unique counsel on rearing children to say \"no\" to drugs, alcohol, and other destructive temptations and to have the exemplary manners that lead to success.  The book is also a complete updated guide to everything you need to know to handle the traditional rites and passages of life in line with current thinking (much of which is different from that of the past). This includes detailed information on weddings, funerals, and religious ceremonies; entertaining any number of people -- from one to one thousand; today's table manners, table setting, and table service; etiquette at work; proper forms of address for these times; and everything you need to know to converse easily in person or on the telephone, to write appropriate letters and notes for every occasion, and much more.  These are real manners for real people in today's complex world. Letitia Baldrige calls them \"manners from the heart,\" and if you have such manners, the world will be with you.",

        "Authors": "By Junger, Sebastian",
        "Description": "In 1963, with the city of Boston already terrified by a series of savage crimes known as the Boston Stranglings, a murder occurred in the quiet suburb of Belmont, just a few blocks from the house of Sebastian Junger's family - a murder that seemed to fit exactly the pattern of the Strangler. Roy Smith, a black man who had cleaned the victim's house that day, was arrested, tried, and convicted, but the terror of the Strangler continued.Two years later, Albert DeSalvo, a handyman who had been working at the Jungers' home on the day of the Belmont murder, and who had often spent time there alone with Sebastian and his mother, confessed in lurid detail to being the Boston Strangler.This is the point of entry to Junger's book: a narrowly averted tragedy for Junger's family opens out into an electrifying exploration of race and justice in America. By turns exciting and subtle, the narrative chronicles three lives that collide - and are ultimately destroyed - in the vortex of one of the first and most controversial serial murder cases in America.",

        "Authors": "By Mandelbaum, Michael",
        "Description": "At the dawn of the twenty-first century, three ideas dominate the world: peace as the preferred basis for relations between and among different countries, democracy as the optimal way to organize political life, and free markets as the indispensable vehicle for the creation of wealth. While not practiced everywhere, these ideas have--for the first time in history--no serious rivals. And although the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were terrible and traumatic, they did not \"change everything,\" as so many commentators have asserted. Instead, these events served to illuminate even more brightly the world that emerged from the end of the Cold War.  In The Ideas That Conquered the World, Michael Mandelbaum describes the uneven spread (over the past two centuries) of peace, democracy, and free markets from the wealthy and powerful countries of the world's core, where they originated, to the weaker and poorer countries of its periphery. And he assesses the prospects for these ideas in the years to come, giving particular attention to the United States, which bears the greatest responsibility for protecting and promoting them, and to Russia, China, and the Middle East, in which they are not well established and where their fate will affect the rest of the world.  Drawing on history, politics, and economics, this incisive book provides a clear and original guide to the main trends of the twenty-first century, from globalization to terrorism, through the perspective of one of our era's most provocative thinkers.",

Proust understood that the essence and value of life was the sum of its everyday parts. As relevant today as they were at the turn of the century, Proust's life and work are transformed here into a no-nonsense guide to, among other things, enjoying your vacation, reviving a relationship, achieving original and unclich\u00e9d articulation, being a good host, recognizing love, and understanding why you should never sleep with someone on a first date. It took de Botton to find the inspirational in Proust's essays, letters and fiction and, perhaps even more surprising, to draw out a vivid and clarifying portrait of the master from between the lines of his work.Here is Proust as we have never seen or read him before: witty, intelligent, pragmatic. He might well change your life.",

        "Description": "Crackling with energy, the unexpected love story of a career-driven mother, a once-resentful daughter, and a ten-year battle with Alzheimer'sAt a time when such things were rare, Elinor Fuchs's mother, Lil, escaped a miserable marriage, took back her maiden name, left young Elinor to be raised by grandparents, and launched a career that led her from the midwest to Washington, D.C.  Rejoining her as an adolescent, Elinor watched as Lil traveled the world selling automotive parts and military gear, gave fabulous parties, and \"in any given room, took up all the air there was.\" With her stunning looks and drive for success, Lil was a figure to admire, not a mother to love.  Elinor determined to despise her mother's values and, once in college, to keep her distance. Making an Exit is the moving account of what happened afterward, during the final years of Lil's life. Following her mother's diagnosis with Alzheimer's, Fuchs finds herself the caretaker.  As the disease progresses, she becomes her mother's mother, dressing her, bathing her, feeding her-all with growing compassion. Lil changes, too: filled with new warmth, the word \"love\" now regularly crosses her lips. And through the fantastic poetry in the disintegration of Lil's language, mother and daughter make a surprising new start.With wit, wisdom, and theatrical flair, Making an Exit tells an uncommon story of a parent's decline-less a conventional narrative of aging and loss than one of discovery, devotion, and spiritual growth. \"The last ten years,\" writes Fuchs, \"they were our best.\"                         Elinor Fuchs, a professor at the Yale School of Drama, is the author of an award-winning play and major works of criticism, including The Death of Character. A nationally recognized theater critic, Fuchs wrote for The Village Voice for more than ten years, and has also contributed to The New York Times, Vogue, and American Theatre. Fuchs lives in Brooklyn.                      From a renowned critic, playwright, and professor of drama comes this energetic and wholly captivating account of living with Alzheimer's\u2014for ten years.At a time when such things were rare, Elinor Fuchs's mother, Lil, escaped a miserable marriage, took back her maiden name, left young Elinor to be raised by grandparents, and launched a career that led her from the Midwest to Washington, D.C.

A book filled with unexpected glimmers of hope, wisdom, and joy . . . [The author] possesses a delightfully wicked sense of humor and a sharp eye for the quirky detail. Fuchs [employs] a deft and efficient prose style, one akin to Augusten Burroughs, David Sedaris, and Anne Lamott. She's also relentlessly unafraid to mine the laughter out of her and her mother's dire situation . . . Making an Exit is a celebration of the life and death of an unforgettable woman, and it is indeed a festive occasion, one generous enough to hold a touching story of a daughter's love and one wise enough to mix a few jokes within the requisite plan.\"\u2014Greg Changnon, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\"How these women touched me! Driven and real, Making an Exit hurtles toward its truths with uncommon feeling and honesty.\"\u2014Gish Jen, author of The Love Wife\"Unflinchingly honest, open-hearted, and funny, this is a work of passionate intelligence and deep humanity.\"\u2014Joyce Antler, author of The Journey Home\"It is refreshing to see the final stages of one woman's life and eventual death treated with such humanity, compassion, and dignity . . . Those horrible phrases that many adult children whose parents succumb to Alzheimer's, senility, or disablement eventually have to deal with\u2014'assisted living' and 'nursing home'\u2014are stripped of much of their mystery in Fuchs' book, and are shown for their absurdity, stark reality, banality, and also moments of joy.\"\u2014Michael Standaert, Los Angeles Times\"Fuchs' mother is larger than life in both her salad days and her days of word salad. And Making an Exit overflows with life\u2014its sorrows and surprises, its follies and joys.\"\u2014Anne Basting, Director of the Center on Age and Community, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee\"A rare and wonderful rollercoaster of a book, tender and touching, hilarious and high-spirited\u2014a moving portrait of a daughter and mother that is fiercely intelligent, ineffably sad, and, finally, transcendent.\"\u2014Kathleen Woodward, author of Aging and its Discontents\"[A] wry account of a once-alienated daughter who becomes ever more entwined with her mother as the older woman makes a memorable decline . . . There's little room for pity or censure as the reader is carried along by a great story. Lillian, an adamantly independent woman all her life, finally needs to be taken care of. She's mostly lost her mind, and although she'll never really know it, she needs her daughter. Fuchs combines her account of the weirdness of caring for a physically competent, mentally absent woman with episodes from their shared past. Her brisk prose effectively captures Lillian's energy, the oddities of communication that Alzheimer's imposes, the endless grind of arranging and placating caregivers, and her own emotional landscape when she finds herself trapped in a state of emergency that lasts a decade. It didn't come cheap, but Fuchs has achieved a beautiful balance of humor and tragedy\u2014all wrung from the same mess of real life.\"\u2014Kirkus Reviews\"A paradoxical line is finely drawn [in this book] between tragedy and comedy; Fuchs depicts her mother's gradual deterioration with humor, sensitivity, and grief that becomes more profound as Lillian weakens. This literate book with its classical underpinnings is an easy, delightful read, and highly recommended for public libraries and consumer collections in hospital and medica",

        "Description": "&#149; What time is it at the North Pole?   &#149; What's the chemical formula for a human being?   &#149; Why do boomerangs come back?   &#149; Why do flying fish fly?   &#149; Do the living really outnumber the dead?   &#149; Why does lightning fork?   &#149; Why does the end of a whip crack?   Everyone has at one time or another thought up odd questions like these, questions that are strange, intriguing, maybe even impossible to answer. Making your morning omelet, perhaps you've wondered why most eggs are egg shaped. Or maybe, the last time you walked on the beach, you felt compelled to ask why the sea is salty. Watching Polly sit on her perch, have you ever marveled at how she stays there -- even when she's asleep? Well, the readers of New Scientist's wildly popular, long-running column \"The Last Word\" thought of these questions, too, and weren't afraid to ask them.   Why Don't Penguins' Feet Freeze? is a brilliant collection of questions and answers for everyone who enjoyed the international, runaway bestseller Does Anything Eat Wasps? Guaranteed to amaze, inform, and delight with topics such as the human body, plants and animals, weird weather, and our wacky world, it'll stump you, enlighten you, entertain and amuse you.",

It\u2019s a topic that has been simmering for years, and Lynne Truss says it\u2019s now reached the boiling point. Taking on the boorish behavior that for some has become a point of pride,Talk to the Hand is a rallying cry for courtesy. Like Eats, Shoots & Leaves,Talk to the Hand is not a stuffy guidebook, and is sure to inspire spirited conversation.Why hasn\u2019t your nephew ever thanked you for your carefully selected gift? What makes your contractor think it\u2019s fine to snub you in the midst of a major renovation? Why do crowds spawn selfishness? What accounts for the appalling treatment you receive in stores (if you\u2019re lucky enough to get a clerk\u2019s attention at all)? Most important, what will it take to roll back a culture that applauds those who are disrespectful? In a recent U.S. survey, 79 percent of adults said that lack of courtesy was a serious problem. For anyone who\u2019s fed up with the brutality inflicted by modern manners (or lack thereof),Talk to the Hand is a colorful call to arms\u2014from the wittiest defender of the civilized world.",

        "Description": "Rising dramatically above all other skyscrapers at the tip of Manhattan, the World Trade Center symbolized New York. From any direction the Towers were lodestars, Manhattan's local mountains. Nearly a decade after the dark events of 9/11, New Yorkers continue to come to terms with the tragedy, and to reminisce about the views of the Towers they once had from their homes and offices. Visitors, too, are remembering how the WTC looked as they approached Manhattan by car, plane, or from the water.  As we mourn for the terrible loss of life, we also want to remember.The 72 images of the World Trade Center presented in this book depict a New York we once knew, one we are now working to rebuild. For more than two decades, practically since the Twin Towers were erected, Sonja Bullaty and Angelo Lomeo have been photographing these awesome buildings. The pictures featured here portray the WTC from all directions, starting with views from the east at dawn, and ending with evening views from the west. There are captivating panoramas from Brooklyn, Lower Manhattan, New Jersey, and uptown, taken in all seasons, as well as a section showing the grand Plaza at the center of the buildings. Together, they create an unforgettable portrait of the Twin Towers.Introducing this extraordinary collection of photographs, Paul Goldberger's text evokes the Towers and the city they came to symbolize. He recalls how they evolved in the public mind, targets of criticism to beloved American icons. He explains their architectural significance and explores their visceral meaning to New Yorkers. In contrast to books depicting the disaster and the days following it, this photographic memoir will be welcomed by all of us&#151; New Yorkers and visitors alike &#151; who yearn to remember the way the city was.A portion of the book's proceeds are donated to the Twin Towers Scholarship Program care of Scholarship America.",

        "Authors": "By Nouwen, Henri J. M.",
        "Description": "A classic work by one of this century's most beloved spiritual writers now reissued.The inspirational writings of Henri Nouwen have touched millions of readers all over the world, and since his death in September 1996, widespread recognition of their enduring value has continued to grow. Now, after being unavailable for several years, Nouwen's Clowning in Rome is available again as an Image trade paperback. In this classic account of the time he spent in Rome, Nouwen offers reflections and spiritual insight characteristic of his best works. During the months in Rome, it wasn't the red cardinals or the Red Brigade who had the most impact on Nouwen, but the little things that took place between the great scenes. In some ways, Nouwen discovered, the real and true story was told by the clowns he often saw in the city streets. In his own words, from the Introduction to Clowning in Rome: \"The clowns are not the center of events. They appear between the great acts, fumble and fall and make us smile again after the tensions created by the heroes we came to admire. The clowns don't have it together--they are awkward, out of balance and left-handed, but--they are on our side. The clowns remind us with a tear and a smile that we are sharing the same human weakness. The longer I was in Rome, the more I enjoyed the clowns, those peripheral people who by their humble, saintly lives evoke a smile and awaken hope, even in a city terrorized by kidnapping and street violence.\"",
