Here are hundreds of tips to help readers tenderize meats, soup up soups, eradicate odor, firm fish fillets, cut grease, ease arthritis, cure cramps and more. Versatile vinegar also does wonders for flavoring food (plus, it has no fat or calories), and readers will be amazed at the range of tasty recipes, which include such treats as Vinegar Pie, Crazy Cake and Vinegar Hard Candy.   For tightwads, environmental activists, health advocates and curious cooks -- in fact, anyone who appreciates good old American ingenuity -- Vim & Vinegar is the perfect book.",

        "Description": "Current Affairs/Asian StudiesPerhaps no nation in recent history has undergone as total a transformation as China has in the past twenty-five years. For Chinese leaders, the death of Mao Zedong, the rise of Deng Xiaoping, and unprecedented economic growth have spawned new complexities. For the country's 1.3 billion citizens, changes have been equally dramatic, from skyrocketing sales in automobiles and satellite dishes to an explosion in violent crime and drug trafficking.The China Reader: The Reform Era is a fascinating compilation by two astute China watchers of the most important documents, articles, and statements on China from 1972 to the present. Here are the voices of the experts, from Chinese analyses of the fall of Soviet Communism to Western expos\u00e9s of an ecological crisis that threatens global weather patterns into the next millennium. Here, too, are the artifacts of an era, from regulations to control Chinese cyberspace to a Party member's Orwellian justification of the military crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authoritative and comprehensive, The China Reader is a timely guide to understanding a nation in the throes of change--a historic moment with profound implications for policy makers and markets from the Pacific Rim to Wall Street.",

        "Description": "Millions of working Americans talk, act, and vote as if their economic interests match those of the megawealthy, the multinational corporations, and the politicians who do their bidding. How did this happen? Bestselling author Thom Hartmann says it\u2019s because the apologists of the Right have become masters of the subtle and largely subconscious aspects of political communication. It\u2019s not an escalation in Iraq, it\u2019s a surge; it\u2019s not the inheritance tax, it\u2019s the death tax; it\u2019s not drilling for oil, it\u2019s exploring for energy. Conservatives didn\u2019t intuit the path to persuasive messaging\u2014they learned these techniques. There is no reason why progressives can\u2019t learn them too. In Cracking the Code, Hartmann shows you how. Drawing on his background as a psychotherapist and advertising executive as well as a nationally syndicated Air America radio host, he breaks down the science and technology of effective communication so you can apply it to your own efforts to counter right-wing disinformation.  As Hartmann explains, political persuasion is as much about biology as ideology, about knowing how the brain processes information and how that influences the way people perceive messages, make decisions, and form a worldview. Throughout the book, he shows you precisely how to master this technology\u2014how to crack the communications code\u2014providing examples dating from the time of the Founding Fathers to the present day.",

You deserve to read it.\" --Dr. Phil McGraw, host of CBS&#39;s nationally syndicated show Dr. Phil Inspiring stories from the frontlines of the battle against addiction by Dr. Phil&#39;s leading interventionist Joani Gammill.Joani Gammill, an average suburban mom on the outside, was secretly addicted to multiple forms of opiates and amphetamine for years, and almost died as a result. Through the life-changing intervention staged by Dr. Phil on his show, Gammill not only committed to getting help for her addiction, but she also went on to become a professional interventionist, helping thousands of others in distress.In The Interventionist, she intertwines her experiences with depictions of her often harrowing and always inspiring interventions of the addicts and families she&#39;s worked with over the years. In each chapter she recounts details of a client&#39;s unique battle with addiction and the devastation that led to a loved one&#39;s request for her help.Gammill&#39;s intriguing story--and the equally captivating stories of the brave people who come to her for help--demonstrates how it is possible to emerge from the seemingly hopeless world of out-of-control drug use and not only regain one&#39;s sanity, but actually discover that life clean and sober can be more meaningful than it ever was before.About the author Joani Gammill, former RN, BRI I, appears regularly on the Dr. Phil show where she leads interventions that have inspired millions of his viewers. Before her career as an interventionist, she worked as a registered nurse in medical facilities, then in a state-run drug-and-alcohol-rehabilitation center.",

        "Title": "Ted Kennedy: The Dream That Never Died",
        "Authors": "By Klein, Edward",
        "Description": "In the most inspiring speech of his career, Ted Kennedy once vowed: \"For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.\"Unlike his martyred brothers, John and Robert, whose lives were cut off before the promise of a better future could be realized, Ted lived long enough to make many promises come true. During a career that spanned an astonishing half-century, he put his imprint on every major piece of progressive legislation\u2013from health care and education to civil rights.There were times during that career\u2013such as after the incident in Chappaquiddick\u2013when Ted seemed to have surrendered to his demons. But there were other times\u2013after one of his inspiring speeches on the floor of the Senate, for example\u2013when he was compared to Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, and other great lawmakers of the past.Indeed, for most of his life, Ted Kennedy played a kaleidoscope of roles\u2013from destructive thrill seeker to constructive lawmaker; from straying husband to devoted father and uncle. InTed Kennedy: The Dream That Never Died, celebrated Kennedy biographer Edward Klein at last reconciles these contradictions, painting a stunningly original, up-to-the-moment portrait of Ted Kennedy and his remarkable late-in-life redemption.Drawing on a vast store of original research and unprecedented access to Ted Kennedy\u2019s political associates, friends, and family, Klein takes the reader behind the scenes to reveal many secrets. Among them:\u2022 Why Caroline Kennedy, at Ted\u2019s urging, aspired to fill the New York Senate vacancy but then suddenly and unexpectedly withdrew her candidacy.\u2022 How Ted ended his longest-lasting romantic relationship to marry Victoria Reggie, and the unexpected effect that union had on his personal and political redemption.\u2022 What transpired between the parents of Mary Jo Kopechne and Ted Kennedy during two private meetings at Ted\u2019s home.\u2022 Which feuds are likely to erupt within the Kennedy family in the wake of Ted\u2019s demise, and what will become of Ted\u2019s fortune and political legacy.Ted Kennedy: The Dream That Never Died does not shrink from portraying the erratic side of Ted Kennedy and his former wife, Joan. But both in spirit and tone, it is a compassionate celebration of a complex man who, in the winter of his life, summoned the best in himself to come to the aid of his troubled nation.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Description": "Your road map through the ups and downs of early childhoodAlmost every child, at some point during their early years won't listen, will throw a tantrum, will be mean or aggressive, shy or withdrawn, be a picky eater, and more. As a parent, you know that differences in children's learning styles and temperaments are a given. However, when any of these problem behaviors become the 'norm' for a child, a red flag should go up. If they affect a child's ability to be happy, relate to others, and go about his daily life, there may be a real problem.Is it a Big Problem, or a Little Problem? will help you to determine:-The size of the problem-How to manage problems on your own with practical tips and strategies-When, if at all, to seek a professional evaluation and what to do in the meantimeLearn when to worry, when not to worry, and what to do. This book will be your essential guide to decoding your child's behavior and navigating the early years of childhood.SHARON ANDERSON, OTR/L, AMY WUSTERBARTH EGAN, MA, AMY FREEDMAN, MA, CCC-SLP, and JUDI GREENBERG, MS, OTR/L are based in Rockville, Maryland at the Ivymount School's Center for Outreach and Education (CORE). Their mission is to help teachers and families identify needs and implement strategies for helping young children be more successful at home and at school. This unique developmental team of four: a speech pathologist, two occupational therapists and a special educator/behavior specialist, hold lectures and workshops throughout the Washington DC area for parents and professionals.Library Journal review:* * *Anderson, Sharon & others (text) & Jessica Glickman (illus.). Is It a Big Problem or a Little Problem?: When To Worry, When Not To Worry, and What To Do. Griffin: St. Martin's. Dec. 2007. c.352p. illus. bibliog. index. ISBN 978-0-312-35412-1. pap. $14.95. CHILD REARINGMany exasperated parents have wondered whether their three year old needs to have his or her hearing checked. Developmental concerns are common, but it can be difficult to tell what behavior is a \"stage\" and what is cause for genuine concern. The authors, Anderson, Amy Egan, Amy Freedman, and Judi Greenberg-all speech, language, behavior, and occupational therapists at the Ivymount School's Center for Outreach and Education in Rockville, MD-divide the book into three sections, \"The Basics,\" \"Understanding Development,\" and \"Where Children Struggle.\" Within these, they illustrate specific concerns (e.g., \"She can hear, why doesn't she understand?\"), explore the range of normal, and examine signals that indicate a need for professional intervention. For \"little problems,\" the authors teach how to rework an environment, routine, or communication strategy to alleviate triggers and encourage mastery. Their strategies for reteaching crucial developmental milestones range from the simple (e.g., no more sippy cups; straws not only improve speech skills but have a calming effect) to the progressive. Disclaimers aside, this book is the equivalent of a valuable appointment with a specialist. Never using an alarmist tone, the authors strike a perfect balance between advocating for early intervention and appreciating the ups and downs of typical childhood behavior. Highly recommended for all libraries.-Julianne J. Smith, Ypsilanti Dist. Lib., MI",

With its compact and easy-to-use format, this book is perfect to take along to the nursery.    Using the comprehensive plant-selection tables, gardeners can see at a glance the most important characteristics of more than 1,500 trees and shrubs, helping them make the best choice for their garden's appearance and cultivation requirements.    The first part of Trees and Shrubs is the plant tables, which are organized by species name and list the plant's characteristics. These are:    Height and spread  Tree, shrub or conifer  Cool, warm-temperate,            subtropical or tropical climate  Full sun, half-sun, heavy shade  Flowering season  Deciduous or evergreen  Showy foliage, showy flowers  Flowering season  Suitability to container planting  Indoor use  Frost tolerance    Having chosen a plant from the table, the gardener then turns to the book's second part, which describes the more than 1,500 species, cultivars and hybrids in greater detail. This includes growing zones and common names, as well as the plants' origins, color variations, growth habit (whether, for example, the shrub is slow growing), propagation techniques, recommended uses, problem parasites or diseases, and extra cultivation notes. Color photographs illustrate a select number of plants.    Trees and shrubs are costly, and it's             despairing to plant a new one only to see it fail. Trees and Shrubs helps gardeners choose the right plant for the right place--and that is the key to a beautiful and successful garden.",

        "Authors": "By Baker, Stephen",
        "Description": "The thrilling story of the computer that can play Jeopardy! Alex Trebek: Meet Watson.For centuries, people have dreamed of creating a machine that thinks like a human. Scientists have made progress: computers can now beat chess grandmasters and help prevent terrorist attacks. Yet we still await a machine that exhibits the rich complexity of human thought \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t just crunch numbers, or take us to a relevant Web page, but understands us and gives us what we need.That vision has driven a team of engineers at IBM. Over three years, they created \u201cWatson\u201d and prepared it for a showdown onJeopardy!, where it would take on two of the game\u2019s all-time champions, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, in a nationally televised event. Final Jeopardy is the entertaining, illuminating story of that computer and that epic match.It\u2019s a classic tale of Man vs. Machine. Like its human competitors, Watson has to understand language, including puns and irony, and master everything from history, literature, and science to arts, entertainment, and game strategy. After years of training, Watson can find the scrambled state capital in \u201cHair Gel\u201d (\u201cWhat is Raleigh?\u201d) and even come up with the facial accessory that made Moshe Dayan recognizable worldwide (\u201cWhat is an eye patch?\u201d). Watson may just be the smartest machine on earth.Final Jeopardy traces the arc of Watson\u2019s \u201clife,\u201d from its birth in the IBM labs to its big night on the podium. We meet Hollywood moguls andJeopardy! masters, genius computer programmers and ambitious scientists, including Watson\u2019s eccentric creator, David Ferrucci. We gain access to Ferrucci\u2019s War Room, where the IBM team works tirelessly to boost Watson\u2019s speed to the buzzer, improve its performance in \u201ctrain wreck\u201d categories (such as \u201cBooks in Espa\u00f1ol\u201d), and fix glitches like the speech defect Watson developed during its testing phase, when it started adding a d to words ending in n (\u201cWhat is Pakistand?\u201d).Much is at stake, especially for IBM. A new generation of Watsons could transform medicine, the law, marketing, even science itself, as machines process huge amounts of data at lightning speed, answer our questions, and possibly come up with new hypotheses.Showdown aside, it\u2019s clear that the future has arrived. But with it come questions: Where does it leave humans? What will Watson\u2019s heirs be capable of in ten or twenty years? Is it time to declare defeat in the realm of facts? What should we teach our children? And what should we carry around in our own heads?Final Jeopardy takes on these questions and more in a narrative that\u2019s as fast and fun as the game itself. Baker shows us how smart machines will fit into our world \u2014 and how they\u2019ll disrupt it.www.finaljeopardy.net",

        "Title": "Jerusalem, Jerusalem: How the Ancient City Ignited Our Modern World",
        "Authors": "By Carroll, James",
        "Description": "James Carroll\u2019s urgent, masterly Jerusalem, Jerusalem uncovers the ways in which the ancient city became a transcendent fantasy that ignites religious fervor unlike anywhere else on earth. That fervor animates American history as much as it does the Middle East, in the present as deeply as in the past. In Carroll\u2019s provocative reading of the deep past, the Bible came into being as an act of resistance to the violence that threatened Jerusalem from the start. Centuries later, holy wars burned apocalyptic Jerusalem into the Western mind, sparking expressly religious conflict among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The heat stretched from Richard the Lionheart to Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, whose World War I conquest of the city relit the fuse for a war that still rages. Carroll\u2019s brilliant leap is to show how, as Christopher Columbus was dispatched from the Crusades-obsessed Knights Templar\u2019s last outpost in Iberia, the New World too was powerfully shaped by the millennial obsessions of the City on a Hill \u2014 from Governor Winthrop to Abraham Lincoln to Woodrow Wilson to Ronald Reagan. Heavenly Jerusalem defines the American imagination \u2014 and always, the earthly city smolders. Jerusalem fever, inextricably tied to Christian fervor, is the deadly \u2014 unnamed \u2014 third party to the Israeli-Palestinian wars. Understanding Jerusalem fever is the key that unlocks world history, and the diagnosis that gives us our best chance to reimagine peace.",

What began with pilfering extra slices of bread at her parents' dinner table turned into binges with cream pies and pancakes, sometimes gaining as much as eleven pounds in four days. When the family urged her father into treatment, the author recognized her own addiction and embarked on the path to recovery by discovering the spiritual hunger beneath her craving for food. Holy Hunger is a brave and perceptive account of compulsion and the healing process.",

Make that a year of Sunday talk shows. That's\u00a0because Amy, as you will discover on every page of this book, knows\u00a0the critical question for journalists is how close they are to the\u00a0truth, not how close they are to power.\"\u2014From the Preface by Bill MoyersIn place of the usual suspects\u2014the \"experts\" who, in Goodman's words, \"know so little about so much, explain the world to us, and get it so wrong\"\u2014this accessible, lively collection allows the voices the corporate media exclude and ignore to be heard loud and clear. From community organizers in New Orleans, to the courageous American soldiers who've said \"No\" to Washington's wars, to the victims of torture and police violence, we are given the extraordinary opportunity to hear ordinary people standing up and speaking out. Written with all of the fierce intelligence and passion for truth that millions have come to expect from Amy Goodman's reportage, Breaking the Sound Barrier proves the power that independent journalism can play in the struggle for a better world, one in which ordinary citizens are the true experts of their own lives and communities.Amy Goodman is an award-winning investigative journalist and syndicated columnist, author and the host/executive producer of Democracy Now! airing on nearly 800 stations worldwide. Goodman is the first journalist to receive the Right Livelihood Award, widely known as the 'Alternative Nobel Prize' for \"developing an innovative model of truly independent grassroots political journalism that brings to millions of people the alternative voices that are often excluded by the mainstream media.\". Goodman is the co-author with her brother, journalist David Goodman, of three New York Times bestsellers: Standing Up to the Madness, Static, and The Exception to the Rulers.",

Whether they\u2019re political or religious, passionate or proud, controversial or corny, these brightly colored, boldly lettered mini manifestos are declarations of who we are, where we stand, and what we\u2019d rather be doing.

        "Authors": "By Hamilton, Peter F.",
        "Description": "Reviewers exhaust superlatives when it comes to the science fiction of Peter F. Hamilton. His complex and engaging novels, which span thousands of years\u2013and light-years\u2013are as intellectually stimulating as they are emotionally fulfilling. Now, with The Dreaming Void, the eagerly awaited first volume in a new trilogy set in the same far-future as his acclaimed Commonwealth saga, Hamilton has created his most ambitious and gripping space epic yet.The year is 3589, fifteen hundred years after Commonwealth forces barely staved off human extinction in a war against the alien Prime. Now an even greater danger has surfaced: a threat to the existence of the universe itself.At the very heart of the galaxy is the Void, a self-contained microuniverse that cannot be breached, cannot be destroyed, and cannot be stopped as it steadily expands in all directions, consuming everything in its path: planets, stars, civilizations. The Void has existed for untold millions of years. Even the oldest and most technologically advanced of the galaxy\u2019s sentient races, the Raiel, do not know its origin, its makers, or its purpose.But then Inigo, an astrophysicist studying the Void, begins dreaming of human beings who live within it. Inigo\u2019s dreams reveal a world in which thoughts become actions and dreams become reality. Inside the Void, Inigo sees paradise. Thanks to the gaiafield, a neural entanglement wired into most humans, Inigo\u2019s dreams are shared by hundreds of millions\u2013and a religion, the Living Dream, is born, with Inigo as its prophet. But then he vanishes.Suddenly there is a new wave of dreams. Dreams broadcast by an unknown Second Dreamer serve as the inspiration for a massive Pilgrimage into the Void. But there is a chance that by attempting to enter the Void, the pilgrims will trigger a catastrophic expansion, an accelerated devourment phase that will swallow up thousands of worlds. And thus begins a desperate race to find Inigo and the mysterious Second Dreamer. Some seek to prevent the Pilgrimage; others to speed its progress\u2013while within the Void, a supreme entity has turned its gaze, for the first time, outward. . . .",

        "Description": "In this gripping expos\u00e9 of our cyber-centric, attention-deficient life, journalist Maggie Jackson argues that we are eroding our capacity for deep attention and mindfulness \u2014 the building blocks of intimacy, wisdom, and cultural progress. The implications for a healthy society are stark.Despite our wondrous technologies and scientific advances, we are nurturing a culture of diffusion and detachment. With our attention scattered among the beeps and pings of a push-button world, we are less and less able to pause, reflect, and deeply connect.In her sweeping quest to unravel the nature of attention and detail its losses, Jackson introduces us to scientists, cartographers, marketers, educators, wired teens, and even roboticists. She offers us a compelling wake-up call, an adventure story, and reasons for hope.As the author shows, neuroscience is just now decoding the workings of attention, with its three pillars of focus, awareness, and judgment, and revealing how these skills can be shaped and taught. This is exciting news for all of us living in an age of overload.Pull over, hit the pause button, and prepare for an eye-opening journey. More than ever, we cannot afford to let distraction become the marker of our time.",

        "Title": "The Illusion of Control: Force and Foreign Policy in the 21st Century",
        "Authors": "By Brown, Seyom",
        "Description": "This provocative book assesses the implications of a disturbing trend in U.S. security policy: an increased willingness to use military force as an instrument of diplomacy. In  The Illusion of Control, Seyom Brown shows how U.S. officials are relying on force to counter a wide range of threats to America's global interests&#151;eclipsing previous strategies that restricted the use of military force to situations in which the country's vital interests were at stake.  Brown points out that a disposition to employ military power broadly as an instrument of diplomacy was on the rise well before September 11, 2001&#151; and it shows every sign of persisting into the future. While resorting to force may seem to be a reliable way to establish control over a disorderly world, Brown cautions that expecting to gain and maintain control through military prowess could turn out to be a dangerous illusion. In fact, employing new military technologies in an effort to control international terrorist activities, wars, and civil conflicts is likely to pull the United States into excessive commitments and imprudent action.   Brown analyzes the growing willingness of U.S. government officials to use force, then critically assesses the strategic, political, and moral implications for the United States. Adapting traditional \"just war\" concepts to contemporary strategic, political, and technological realities, he offers a set of guidelines to help ensure that use-of-force decisions are approached with the judicious care and gravity they warrant.",

But on her deathbed, Kit\u2019s mother tells him he was adopted and that his birth name was Novello. Soon, vague memories of his early life begin to surface: his nursery, pictures on the wall, the smell of his birth mother when she\u2019d been cooking. And, sometimes, there are more disturbing memories\u2014of strangers taking him by the hand and leading him away from the only family he had ever known. A search of old newspaper files reveals that a three-year-old boy named Peter Novello was abducted from his parents\u2019 holiday hotel in Sicily in 1989. Now the young man who has known himself only as Kit sets out to rediscover his past, the story of two three-year-old boys torn from their mothers in very different circumstances. Kit\u2019s probing inquiries are sure to bring surprises. They may also unearth dangerous secrets that dare never be revealed.
