The staphylococcus plague 2006 wiped out forty million people, the crash of '07 ruined many national economies, and in America the assassination of President Emily Forrester in 2018 traumatized the nation. The Internet remains the main source of information, bombarding people everywhere with news, rumors, and allegations twenty-four hours a day - and creating enormous possibilities for the manipulation of mankind.New York psychiatrist, criminal profiler, and historian Dr. Gideon Wolfe becomes enmeshed in this world of deception when the wife of a murdered special effects wizard brings him a computer disc containing startling evidence that the now-famous visual record of President Forresrer's assassination was digitally altered by her husband. Investigating this crime, Wolfe enlists the help of his oldest friend, Max Jenkins, a private detective expert in all forms of information manipulation.When Max, too, is murdered, a stunned and enraged Wolfe sets out to uncover who is behind the Forrester hoax and the killings, a journey that leads him to a secret group of scientific and military experts who - led by an ailing, mysterious young genius and his beautiful, brilliant sister - have undertaken to demonstrate the astonishing degree to which the public can be deceived and manipulated. Seduced in every way, Wolfe joins the team. But are their methods really as noble as their motives?",

        "Description": "Winner of multiple Hugo and Nebula awards, voted favorite writer of the 1980s by readers of Locus magazine, David Brin commands one of the most eloquent, incisive voices in science fiction today. Now the New York Times bestselling author of Earth, Startide Rising, and The Uplift War returns to set a new course, delivering a novel rich in texture, universal in theme, monumental in scope - pushing the genre to new heights.Long ago, the Founding Mothers left old Earth and the Phylum Worlds, seeking a hidden place to reforge human destiny. Through genetic wizardry, they have altered human sexual patterns. For most of the year, any child born on planet Stratos is a clone of her mother, identical to all the sisters in her venerable clan. Only in summer are \"vars\" conceived - old-fashioned, gene-mixed girls, and even sometimes boys - each one garishly, ignobly unique.Maia, one lonely young var, grows up knowing she must summon all her skill to win a place in this world run by and for high-caste clanswomen. A world far gentler than those of the Old Phylum ...except for those rare seasons of change, where the planet seems to call its people forth to glory.Preparing to set sail, Maia watches the strange, bearded face of the seamen. Are the teachings true? Are men practically another species, fit only for brief encounters? Or might their arts and games and secret ways hint of something deeper to share with the women of Stratos?Ready to seek a place in the world, Maia sets forth expecting labor and hardship. What she finds is danger, adventure, and a strange, half-innocent emissary, whose simple message may mean new hope...or a return to ancient terrors. From the vast unforgiving sea, to imprisonment, to rocky depths where she must wrest hidden secrets from the clutches of time, Maia comes to understand why the Founding Mothers sought a change in human life...and what a price their descendants must pay.Here is a saga of remarkable passion and drama, set in a faraway place and time but shining light upon issues vexing our own confused era. Given the laws of biology and growing alienation on the part of many women, might an experiment such as Stratos Colony ever come to pass? David Brin makes it seem both chillingly and rousingly believable. A moving, satirical, exciting, and finally transcendent tale of the human spirit, this major novel is about a time when all the people of a human world - men and women - must come face-to-face with their glory season.",

As the nation's most provocative and effective Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, he took on the tobacco industry and alerted the nation to rising health care costs. He sees health reform as a perpetual process continuing into the next century, one too important to leave to politicians, physicians, providers, and policy wonks because we patients and taxpayers have the greatest personal stake in the outcome.Califano urges bold action to save the best of American medicine, nourish its genius, contain its costs, and democratize its miracle cures. He warns that the obsession of the nation's politicians with raising campaign money and their fetish with financing and delivering sick care will continue to push up costs and limit the number of Americans with access to care. Speaking with uncommon candor and lively anecdotes, he shows why successful reform must reshape not just the treatment of illness and injury, but also where the nation invests its research dollars and how much it devotes to prevention.",

Kinsella established himself as a storyteller of unsurpassed wit and an unforgettably whimsical voice. But Kinsella's new novel, Box Socials, is easily the best book of his career. Set in the small towns, ball fields, barns and bedrooms of Alberta, Canada, and populated by some of the quirkiest, rowdiest, hottest-blooded folks in fiction, Box Socials paints a brilliantly comic, full-color portrait of North American life in the 1940s.Here's the story of how Truckbox Al McClintock, a small-town greaser whose claim to fame was hitting a baseball clean across the Pembina River, almost got a tryout with the genuine St. Louis Cardinals - but instead ended up batting against Bob Feller of Cleveland Indian fame in Renfrew Park, Edmonton, Alberta. Along the way to Al's moment of truth at the plate, we learn about the bizarre, touchingly hilarious lives and loves of just about anyone who ever passed through New Oslo, Fark, or Venusberg.Narrator Jamie O'Day, the young wide-eyed offspring of downwardly mobile hillbillies, plunks us down in the middle of the wild six-day Ukrainian wedding of Lavonia Lakustra and her Little American Soldier. He introduces us to the luscious Velvet Bozniak, who knows more about sex than any girl has a right to and who is determined to share all her wisdom with Jamie. And of course he attends a slew of box socials, whist drives, and community dances, where the women gossip and flirt while the men tank up on Heathen's Rapture and haul off to engage in the only sport they know aside from baseball - fistfights.Full of the crackle of down-home folk tales, by turns randy, riveting and heart-breaking, Box Socials is the triumph of Kinsella's career.",

        "Description": "For twenty-three years, Clive Cussler's NUMA&reg-the National Underwater & Marine Agency-has scoured the rivers and seas in search of lost ships of historic significance. His teams have been inundated by tidal waves, and beset by the vagaries of man and nature, but the results-and the stories behind them-have often been dramatic: The 2000 raising of the Confederate submarine Hunley made national headlines.  Here, then, are more true tales of sea- and land-going adventures, as Cussler and his crews set out to track down history. The famous ghost ship Mary Celeste, found floating off the Azores in 1872 with no one on board; the Carpathia, the ship that rescued the Titanic survivors and was itself lost to U-boats six years later; L'Oiseau Blanc, the airplane that almost beat The Spirit of St. Louis across the Atlantic before disappearing in the Maine woods-all these, plus steamboats, ironclads, a seventeenth-century flagship, a certain famous PT boat, and even a dirigible, prove tantalizing targets as Cussler demonstrates again that truth can be \"at least as fun, and sometimes stranger, than fiction\" (Men's Journal).",

        "Title": "Lift Every Voice: Turning a Civil Rights Setback Into a New Vision of Social Justice",
        "Authors": "By Guinier, Lani",
        "Description": "In 1993, shortly after his inauguration, new President Bill Clinton nominated his old friend and classmate Lani Guinier to the prestigious and crucial post of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.  That nomination sparked an immediate firestorm of criticism from the right, labeling Professor Guinier the \"Quota Queen\" and assailing her for the ideas expressed in her publications, most of which her opponents had not read, or had taken out of context and misunderstood.  In the face of this concerted opposition -- what one friend of Guinier's called \"a low-tech lynching\" -- Clinton backed down, not only withdrawing her nomination, but having refused throughout to give her an opportunity to speak out in her own defense (and his). The result was a civil rights setback of monumental proportions.  Now, in this remarkable and important book, at once a memoir and insider's account of what really happened behind the closed doors of the Oval Office, the Justice Department, and the U.S. Senate, and an insightful look at the past, present, and future of civil rights in America, Lani Guinier at last breaks her silence.  Unsparing of her own mistakes and shrewdly perceptive about the overt and hidden agendas of those who opposed her, Professor Guinier shows how the president promptly abandoned his ambitious agenda for civil rights at the first hint of criticism from the media and Congress -- and how the civil rights movement suffered a major setback as a result.  More important, this book, in Professor Guinier's own words, is about \"the battles fought in the belief that our racial history and our commitment to equality and democracy are essential parts of the same story. It has not always been a pretty story, nor one that follows an inevitable path.  \"This book is not, however, an effort to settle scores. It's a story of the efforts of men and women who believe fundamentally in the promise of the American creed and who act on that belief in their everyday lives. These are people whose lives are without notoriety or fame, but in whose willingness to take risks we see the honor of real heroism.\"  Above all, Guinier goes on to describe how her experience at the hands of the press, the White House, and her congressional enemies has given her both a new voice and a renewed faith in the ongoing struggle for civil rights. Her book is an extraordinary account of just how the civil rights movement acquired its strength, drawn from the courage of \"ordinary\" people standing up against fearful odds for what was right, and from the commitment to make change happen from the bottom up, relying on the wisdom and common sense of those at grassroots level. Using her own nomination as a symbolic point of reference, she shows just how weak and divided the cause of civil rights has become, as its leaders have all too often been silenced by the very people they should be challenging.  Finally, she explains, in her own words, the truth about her political ideas -- which are rooted in democracy and its principles, not in quotas and affirmative action -- and examines the state of current race relations. Renewing her call for a national conversation on the issue of civil rights and social justice, this thought-provoking book is certain to spark a",

        "Authors": "By Ackerman, Farrell and Webelhuth, Gert",
        "Description": "When studying linguistics, it is commonplace to find that information packaged into a single word in one language is expressed by several independent words in another language. This observation raises an important question: how can linguistics research represent what is the same among languages while accounting for the obvious differences between them? In this work, two linguists-Farrell Ackerman and Gert Webelhuth-from different theoretical paradigms develop a new general theory of natural language predicates. This theory is capable of addressing a broad range of issues concerning (complex) predicates, many of which remain unresolved in previous theoretical proposals. The book focuses on cross-linguistically recurring patterns of predicate formation. It also provides a detailed implementation of Ackerman and Webelhuth's theory for German tense-aspect, passive, causative, and verb-particle predicates. In addition, a discussion of the extension of these representative analyses to the same predicate construction in other languages is presented. Beyond providing a formalism for the analysis of language-particular predicates, the authors demonstrate how the basic theoretical mechanism they develop can be employed to explain universal tendencies of predicate formation.",

For instance, Groucho Marx on politics: \"Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies.\" A Visible Ink bestseller since the reign of George the Senior, it just keeps going and going. Apparently good quotes, like fine wine, just get better with age. Or maybe it's the back cover copy. With Power Quotes, readers can learn what Plato and Aristotle had to say about democracy, and find Mark Twain musing on any number of topics, including: \"Its name is Public Opinion. It is held in reverence. It settles everything. Some think it is the voice of God.\" Or look up the self-serving statements James I made to Parliament about the divine nature of kings (he was for it). Richard Nixon's postmortem on Vietnam: \"Rarely have so many people been so wrong about so much.\" Selected with impeccable judgment by quote master Daniel Baker, the quotes are organized under 50 themes such as ethics, monarchy, politics, public opinion, taxes, war and peace, and women in politics, and then arranged chronologically, with sources fully cited.",

        "Description": "The 9/11 Investigations lifts the curtain on the top-secret investigations into the worst attack in American history. Here in one place is the most salient information from both the Joint House-Senate Inquiry and the 9/11 Commission investigation, distilled into a narrative that readers can understand.   First, The 9/11 Investigations presents the most shocking discoveries to emerge in the course of the investigations. Former Newsweek editor Steven Strasser has combed through the extensive investigative documents and extracted the most revelatory information about 9/11 itself--the al Qaeda plot, the terrorist attack, the emergency response--as well as troubling insights into the inner workings of our government:  the decision-making process at the top levels of government, the  miscommunication between the FBI and CIA, and the fatal oversights made by the Bush administration before the attacks.    Second, The 9/11 Investigations explores the investigation process itself. A lead essay by Craig R. Whitney, assistant managing editor of the New York Times, places the 9/11 investigation into a historical context of other governmental investigations such as the Warren Report and the Pearl Harbor investigation. Whitney also explores the political power plays that have affected the investigation's progress, addressing these fundamental questions: Why hasn't the Bush administration cooperated fully with the 9/11 Commission? How has the administration's behavior affected the work of the Commission? Who will be held responsible for the intelligence and leadership failures revealed by the investigations? And perhaps most importantly: Will the 9/11 investigation help prevent such a tragedy from happening again? Are we any safer for their work?   Together, these documents and analysis provide an in-depth look at how America has tried to deal with the shocking impact of the 9/11 attacks.",

        "Description": "\"The classic of its kind.\" \u2014Travel World\"One of the most readable books in the whole library of adventure.\" \u2014Sports Illustrated\"The finest single-handed adventure story yet written.\" \u2014SeafarerChallenged by an expert who said it couldn't be done, Joshua Slocum, an indomitable New England sea captain, set out in April of 1895 to prove that a man could sail alone around the world. 46,000 miles and a little over 3 years later, the proof was complete: Captain Slocum had performed the epic \"first\" single-handedly in a trusty 34-foot sloop called the \"Spray.\" This is Slocum's own account of his remarkable adventures during the historic voyage.Slocum writes in a fast-paced, exhilarating style. His almost matter-of-fact descriptions of hazardous episodes and his colorful, often witty observations make this book perhaps the most delightful and absorbing adventure tale in history. Across the Atlantic he sailed, but chased by Moorish pirates off Gibraltar, he decided to circle Cape Horn instead and go around the world the other way! He tells of perils on stormy seas and of numerous harrowing events: his escape from a fleet of hostile canoes; an encounter with Black Pedro, \"the worst murderer in Tierra del Fuego\"; foiling a nocturnal attack by savages by strewing carpet tacks on the \"Spray's\" deck; submerged by a great wave off the Patagonian coast; the \"rain of blood\" in Australia; dodging coral reefs in the South Seas. In Samoa, he was visited by Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson; in South Africa, he talked congenially with Stanley of \"Stanley and Livingstone\" fame, and met \"Oom Paul\" Kruger, President of the Transvaal republic. Kruger was incensed when one of his officials described Slocum's voyage as \"around the world,\" since his religious beliefs convinced him that the world was flat!This robust classic of the sea has been widely read ever since its first publication in 1900. It has been reprinted several times and has even been required reading in many schools. This edition (complete with all of the original Thomas Fogarty illustrations) of Captain Slocum's story will prove as enjoyable and thrilling to the present generation of Americans as it was to our fathers and grandfathers.",

        "Description": "A voyage of Arctic exploration during the American Civil War becomes an epic tale of madness and survival in a stunning first novel animated by the spirits of Poe, Crane, Conrad, and Melville.Brendan Kane is a dreamy, directionless young man in 1860s New England.  Fired by a speech given by a traveling recruiter, he signs up for the Union cause \u2013 and experiences the full horrors of the Civil War.  He deserts, drifting north to experience the draft riots in New York and, finally, to meet his fate in the form of the Narthex, a strangely shaped vessel anchored in the harbor of a whaling town.  Kane signs up as a crew member without any inkling of the voyage\u2019s destination or goals, joining a crew of odd outcasts not unlike that of the Pequod, including one Aziz, the three-handed Muslim engine tender, and Dr. Architeuthis, the ship\u2019s scientist whose mania for data becomes increasingly indistinguishable from madness.  While at sea, they come to learn that their goal is a mythic temperate valley, a paradise in the heart of the Arctic?a goal their captain and the Narthex\u2019s owner will stop at nothing to reach. At once spiritual, adventurous, and bleak, The Rope Eater displays a precise knowledge of the period and the customs of nineteenth century Arctic exploration. In its scope and rich language, it recalls the work of the great novelists of inner and outer voyaging?a tremendous debut novel.",
