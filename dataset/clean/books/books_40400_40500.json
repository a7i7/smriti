        "Description": "A Hand Up Instead of a HandoutIn order to break the urban cycle of poverty and oppression, our communities need the empowerment that comes from a practical education\u2014one that combines biblical principles with real-world knowledge and application. Inner-city churches are ideal for providing such an education. The Gathering Place shows how your church can give needy people not only a handout, but also an essential hand up to successful lives.\u201cThis book serves as a training manual . . . even for those who are ill-equipped for or overwhelmed by the task of urban church education,\u201d writes Dr. James R. Love Sr. From his years of experience with urban churches, Dr. Love shows how the church can bring people together and give them the spiritual and practical resources needed to put the life-changing power of the gospel in motion.With case studies demonstrating urban church education in action, The Gathering Place includes: \u00b7 Introduction: Forging a Vision \u00b7 Empowerment: Why Urban Church Education Is Needed \u00b7 The City on a Hill: The Context of Urban Church Education \u00b7 Liberated to Learn: Principles of Empowering Education \u00b7 In Order to Succeed: Constructing a Christian Education Ministry \u00b7 Follow the Leader: Becoming an Empowering Teacher \u00b7 Striving for Knowledge: The Legacy of African-American Education \u00b7 Reap What You Sow: Developing a Christian Philosophy of Education",

Life has given us many more blessings than we have allowed ourselves to receive. My Grandfather's Blessings is about how we can recognize and receive our blessings and bless the life in others.

When Sheba Hart joins St. George's as the new art teacher, Barbara senses the possibility of a new friendship. It begins with lunches and continues with regular invitations to meals with Sheba's seemingly close-knit family. But as Barbara and Sheba's relationship develops, another does as well: Sheba has begun a passionate affair with an underage male student. When it comes to light and Sheba falls prey to the inevitable media circus, Barbara decides to write an account in her friend's defense\u2014an account that reveals not only Sheba's secrets but her own.What Was She Thinking? is a story of repression and passion, envy and complacence, friendship and loneliness.

        "Title": "In Full Flower: Aging Women, Power, and Sexuality",
        "Authors": "By Banner, Lois W",
        "Description": "Here, brilliantly and provocatively drawn in the context of history from prepatriarchal times to the present, is the woman of mature years as she has been envisaged by herself, by men, and by her sisters--as she has been mythologized, denigrated, adored, tyrannized, empowered.Beginning with the earliest known rituals and legends and continuing through Western history, Lois Banner explores the roots of our changing attitudes toward growing old--and the stereotypes that have often expressed them--tracing the ways in which both women and men have been shaped by their cultures and by the continuous counterposing of spirituality and sexuality. Interweaving social, literary, and demographic history, she shows us the waxing and waning status of the woman past girlhood--from her primacy at the dawn of history (as suggested in veiled stories of woman's power), through the classical and early medieval eras, to her decline from the thirteenth century to the eighteenth.And we see the emergence that followed of the idealized, domesticated, and sentimentalized nuclear family centered around the mother--and the concurrent vilification or mockery of the older unmarried woman, which continues to the present.Banner provides new perspective on such subjects as goddess-young god stories in ancient religions, witchcraft, menopause, changes in male and female dress, the rise of the grandmother as a social type, and affectionate and erotic relationships through history, particularly between older women and younger men. She contemplates the mature women portrayed in high and popular art, from Penelope in the Odyssey and the Wife of Bath in The Canterbury Tales to Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard. She writes about attempts over the centuries to mute the voices of older women--and about those who could not be silenced, from Sappho to Elizabeth I, from the women of France's eighteenth-century salons to nineteenth-century reformers and twentieth-century writers.Throughout we see the autonomy and social power of women as a continuing ebb and flow--periods of progress toward gender equality alternating with periods of decline--as Lois Banner follows the threads of conflicting and complementary social impulses to create a richly detailed and comprehensive narrative tapestry, a superb historical portrait of generations of women in full flower.",

With an ear for acid dialogue and an eye for everyday ironies, Ciresi unfolds Rosa Salvatore's tale: growing up on fantasies, guilt, and fagioli in the New Haven working-class Italian neighborhood of Pizza Beach; working her way through a local college by slinging hash, while agonizing over her thighs and aching for passion; landing a job and meeting Gary Fisher, a nice Jewish lawyer from Flushing with a great butt and angst of his own. Rosa and Gary fall in love, make love, get married, fight, make up, fight again--until Gary is diagnosed with a terminal illness, and Rosa realizes the power of her love--and the crushing force of regret.Frank and warm, crackling with razor-sharp wit, Blue Italian is a love story about an ill-fated couple who almost missed realizing how much they loved each other. It establishes Rita Ciresi as a writer with a unique gift for language, character, and emotion--a novelist to read, and a novelist to watch.",

In the days before blogs, teenagers recorded their lives with a pen in top-secret notebooks, usually emblazoned with an earnest, underlined plea to parents to keep away. Since 2002, David Nadelberg has tapped that vast wellspring of adolescent anguish in the stage show Mortified, in which grown men and women confront their past with firsthand tales of their first kiss, first puff, worst prom, fights with mom, life at bible camp, worst hand job, best mall job, and reasons they deserved to marry Simon LeBon.   Following the same formula that has made the live show a beloved cult hit, Mortified the book takes real childhood journals and documents and edits the entries into captivating, comedic, and cathartic stories, introduced by their now older (and allegedly wiser) authors. From letters begging rescue from a hellish summer camp to catty locker notes about stuck-up classmates to obsessive love that borders on stalking, Mortified gives voice to the real -- and really pathetic -- hopes, fears, desires, and creative urgings that have united adolescents for generations.",

Alexandra Brennan is fed up with her dead end New York City job-and even more fed up of running into her smug ex-boyfriend. So when he crosses the line by telling her that she'll never get into graduate school in the United Kingdom, that's precisely what she does. Armed with imported cigarettes and extra strength coffee, Alex leaves home and crosses the Atlantic to face all that Great Britain and grad school have to offer, including ill-considered romantic interludes, a red-headed nemesis with intellectual pretensions and ulterior motives, a preponderance of eighties music, and more books than she can possibly read in a year. What she discovers, however, is that instead of running away from home - she may have actually found it. With a cheeky sense of humor and terrific cast of characters, ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE is a funny and irreverent novel about a young woman's misadventures on the path to adulthood.",
