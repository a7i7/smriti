Especially for their daughter, Grace.Well, that's what she likes to be called. Her family insists on Maria Graziella. Seriously, enough with the Neapolitan. That might have been okay in New Jersey, but now it's just plain silly, and Grace at thirty-two is, horror of horrors, still unmarried. No wonder her family drives her crazy. Well, that and the fact that she's living with the man she would marry if they both weren't so commitment phobic. Michael is a doctor and a scientist and Grace is pretty sure he's also an atheist. Over the years, Grace has become a bit ambivalent about her faith, but her family is as old-fashioned Italian as they come. So the stage is set for a major showdown that just might change Grace's outlook on life, family, and the New South.",

        "Title": "MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service",
        "Authors": "By Dorril, Stephen",
        "Description": "M16, Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, is one of the great information-gathering organizations of the world, internationally renowned as the employer of the mythical but emblematic James Bond. Yet it has remained one of the nation's most elusive organizations. Its head, Richard Dearlove, is virtually unknown -- a contemporary photograph has never appeared in the press -- and even its true budget is not made public. There is no legal \"right to know\" what is undertaken abroad in the name of Britain's security, what it costs or how it is run. In the past, any dissident reports of its operations were effectively quashed. To write about M16 risks harassment and prosecution, as former members and current commentators know to their cost, and the organization has remained veiled from scrutiny. Its inside story has never been told. Until now.  Stephen Dorril, a meticulous observer and chronicler of the security services, provides a full fifty-year history for the first time, offering the most complete portrait ever of M16's motives and character and, crucially, what it has done and where it has been most influential. At the beginning of the Cold War, Britain was a global power literally dividing up the world. By 1992, influence abroad had been lost in the Middle East, most of Africa and large swathes of Asia. Even in Europe, Britain seemed exiled and isolated. What had M16 been doing? M16's postwar activities were mired in prewar attitudes and practices, at home in the exclusive clubs of Pall Mall but poorly suited to a retreating post-imperial power. Britain's management of the Cold War was in the itching hands of a mixture of frustrated former members of the wartime Special Operations Executive, desperate for active military engagements, anxious reactionaries and a few socialist devotees for whom communism was the future and spying the career of choice.  This is the first operational history of M16, the first look at the organization in action. With a level of detail unparalleled in the annals of British intelligence, Dorril chronicles the fascinating history from 1949 to the current day. Replete with tales of its most spectacular failures, stirring successes, unsavory plots and bizarre missions, the real-life cloak-and-dagger world is exposed. From the grisly truth about Operation Stalin, which exploited the Russian dictator's paranoia and led to the execution of thousands, to the tunnel M16 dug beneath the Berlin wall to the recruitment methods, training programs and space-age gadgetry of the modern spy, this definitive history has it all.  M16 is a vital, essential arm of the British state. It is Britain's player at the chessboard of international intelligence-gathering and a key partner to America's superpower status. Dorril's is a searching story of the characters and situations in which the games have been played, from the back streets of Aden to the Brandenburg Gate, the mountains of Albania to the shores of the Black Sea. This is a discreet and riveting history of half a century of international political intriguing, spying and thuggery -- all in the name of intelligence.",

Dr. Temperance Brennan, Quebec's director of forensic anthropology, now returns in a thrilling new investigation into the secrets of the dead.  In the bitter cold of a Montreal winter, Tempe Brennan is digging for a corpse buried more than a century ago. Although Tempe thrives on such enigmas from the past, it's a chain of contemporary deaths and disappearances that has seized her attention -- and she alone is ideally placed to make a chilling connection among the seemingly unrelated events. At the crime scene, at the morgue, and in the lab, Tempe probes a mystery that sweeps from a deadly Quebec fire to startling discoveries in the Carolinas, and culminates in Montreal with a terrifying showdown -- a nerve-shattering test of both her forensic expertise and her skills for survival.",

The author of these prayers is Julia's mother, who wrote them because she was troubled that she and her daughter no longer talked as much as they used to. So each night, she left a verse on Julia's pillow. Julia shared them with her younger sister and with her friends, and the prayers moved outward in ever-widening circles.Now everyone can enjoy and meditate upon these simple supplications, whose words, feelings, and perspective are those of a girl growing into womanhood. Nearly one hundred and fifty prayers encourage girls to look inward for the strength to heal hurts, calm fears, and reconcile with family and friends. They present the values of self-reliance and confidence, celebrating the gift of life and the unique pleasure and challenges of being a girl. Each prayer is a loving act of faith, and together they provide a safe and private space in which a girl can simply be and grow.",

        "Authors": "By Thomas, Hugh",
        "Description": "In Conquest one of the most distinguished modern historians has written the first major history of the conquest of Mexico since Prescott's classic account, published over 150 years ago.Cortes' conquest of Mexico in 1519-1521 is one of the most famous stories in the world. Macaulay wrote that the way Aztec emperor Montezuma died was one of the two things that every schoolboy knew. The story of the 500 conquistadores landing near Vera Cruz, the subsequent burning of the boats, the march up to the Aztec capital, the extraordinary battles and ruses en route, the welcome by Montezuma, the later quarrels, the Spanish withdrawal, the bloody fighting, and the eventual apocalyptic victory can never fail to excite the imagination.Drawing on newly discovered sources and taking into account information not available to earlier scholars, Hugh Thomas, author of the bestselling The Spanish Civil War and The History of the Cuban Revolution, presents a full and balanced history of one of the most significant events of Western civilization, a subject and an era of continued fascination to millions of readers.Here, in a brilliant and detailed narrative, full of the sound and fury of great events and the clash of empires and personalities, is a book that rivals Prescott's for its sweeping view of history, but is written with a new respect for the civilization and culture that Cortes ruthlessly destroyed.Hugh Thomas' account of the collapse of Montezuma's great Mexican empire under the onslaughts of Cortes' conquistadores is one of the major historical works of the decade. It bristles with moral and political issues that are profoundly relevant to our time, and is also a thrilling narrative, brimful of the sheer excitement of discovery.",

Now the mistress of Regency-period romantic suspense brings us a notorious widow and a man of mystery as they flirt with danger, fight temptation, and fall into the snare of desire and intrigue....Madeline Deveridge is all too aware of the whispers behind her back, the rumors that she dispatched her husband to the next world and concealed her crime. But Madeline has a far more pressing problem than being called the Wicked Widow. She fears that she and her beloved aunt are being haunted! And all the evidence points to one improbable culprit: the ghost of her late husband. Of course it is impossible, but Madeline cannot take chances. So she dares summon the only person with the power to help her uncover the truth--Artemis Hunt.Brilliant, relentless, reclusive, Artemis has made it his business to keep much of his private life hidden. No one knows that he's the owner of the Dream Pavilions, London's favorite pleasure gardens, or that he's a master of an arcane society. Curiosity brings him out on a fog-shrouded night to meet the infamous Wicked Widow, but his amusement quickly flees when he realizes that Madeline has learned enough about his affairs to wreak havoc on his carefully ordered existence. He must secure her guarantee never to divulge his secrets to anyone, even if it means helping her track down a phantom.As soon as the bargain is struck, Artemis and Madeline find their arrangement complicated by a searing desire, and the frightening realization that the ghost poses a very real danger. Now they must plunge into a world of intrigue and ancient mysteries, where a tantalizing passion--and a calculating killer--will not be denied. She's known as the Wicked Widow, for rumors abound that she dispatched her husband to the next world.\u00a0\u00a0But Madeline Deveridge has a more vexing problem than her scandalous reputation.\u00a0\u00a0Her husband's ghost is haunting her! She must exorcise him, and turns to Artemis Hunt for aid.\u00a0\u00a0Owner of the Dream Pavilions, London's favorite pleasure gardens, Artemis is no stranger to the exotic and the mysterious.\u00a0\u00a0So he agrees to join Madeline in her unusual enterprise, never expecting to find himself in the thrall of true passion.\u00a0\u00a0But the ghost is a real menace -- and intent on using Madeline for a deadly purpose. -->",

Yet this novel is not the cheerful celebration of Victorian life one might have expected from the beloved author of The Pickwick Papers and The Old Curiosity Shop. Compressed, stark, allegorical, it is a bitter expos\u00e9 of capitalist exploitation during the industrial revolution\u2013and a fierce denunciation of the philosophy of materialism, which threatens the human imagination in all times and places. With a typically unforgettable cast of characters\u2013including the heartless fact-worshipper Mr. Gradgrind, the warmly endearing Sissy Jupe, and the eternally noble Stephen Blackpool\u2013Hard Times carries a uniquely powerful message and remains one of the most widely read of Dickens\u2019s major novels.",

Iran\u2019s past, present, and future are exposed\u2014the country\u2019s quest for nuclear weapons and support of Palestinian terror groups, its ability to \u201cplay the oil card,\u201d and Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s apocalyptic beliefs that motivate his actions. You\u2019ll discover the truth about today\u2019s events, how they relate to Bible prophecy, and what the Bible clearly describes is yet to come. It\u2019s a crisis unlike any the world has ever faced. Are We Headed for a Nuclear Jihad? \u201cIsrael must be wiped off the map,\u201d Iran president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said it himself. He has denied the Holocaust, and his actions are motivated by a dangerous apocalyptic view of Islam. Meanwhile, Islamic extremists are in hot pursuit of nuclear weapons as they stand as gatekeepers to the Persian Gulf oil flow. Closer to home, President Bush has stated that the greatest threat to America is nuclear terrorism. In a prophecy written over 2,500 years ago, Ezekiel 38-39 foretells Iran \u2019s future. Iran , Russia , and other Islamic nations will invade Israel in the end times. Today, the connection between Iran and Russia only grows. How close is this invasion? What will happen? Will America survive? Will the world? Mark Hitchcock , an expert in Bible prophecy, exposes Iran \u2019s past, present, and future with striking clarity. Find maps, charts, and answers to your every question inside. \u201cI highly recommend Mark as a faithful guide to understanding current events in light of God\u2019s wonderful plan of prophecy.\u201d -Tim LaHaye, Pastor and bestselling author Story Behind the BookThere seems to be no turning back from the looming crisis in the Middle East. The Islamic and political rulers of Iran are set in their ideology by principle. The West and Israel are headed for some sort of confrontation economically, socially, and likely militarily. Mark Hitchcock \u2019s background as a lawyer, pastor, and expert in Bible prophecy suits him perfectly as a Christian authority on the subject. Timing is critical, and his new book will release as more and more everyday people\u2014Christians and non-Christians alike\u2014realize the gravity of world events and question how they relate to Bible prophecy.",

With self-deprecating humor and compassionate insight, she remembers the time she hit her baby sister in the head with a rock, how her father taught her to swim by throwing her into deep water, and the day when-while weighing in at 300 pounds-she became an inspirational goddess at her local gym. Filled with universal stories about a daughter's love for her parents and the eternal quest for finding meaning in it all, this book reveals many seemingly unremarkable moments that make a life-the weighty events that, like fat girls sitting on lawn chairs, just won't let go.",

        "Description": "The Official Scrabbler Brand Word-Finder is designed with one thing in mind: scoring big points. The method is simple--present as many playable words as possible, in one place, for easy reference during a game. Over 60,000 high-scoring words are arranged alphabetically by first letter and by inside letters, providing the widest array of possible word variations. This innovative format allows Scrabbler fanatics to consider hundreds of potential plays with one quick glance. The Word-Finder is also a one-of-a-kind resource for the obscure words sometimes necessary to get you out of a pinch--like when you're stuck with a \"z\" and an \"h\" and time is running out (\"hazard\": 19 points).  In this straightforward format, standard suggestions are listed in regular type, high-scoring words (worth 10 to 14 points) are listed in bold face, and extra high-scoring words (worth 15 points or more) are marked with an asterisk. A quick scan of the word suggestions invariably leads to a variety of possible plays. A handy dictionary of prefixes, suffixes and plurals provides ideas for adding even more points to your score, and \"Ten Tips for a Better Game\" addresses winning Scrabbler strategies. The Official Scrabbler Brand Word-Finder features a complete list of every accepted two-letter and three-letter word, and there's even a Quick Check Usage Guide listing all the acceptable words in special categories like \"Animal\" and \"Medical\" that aren't always included in standard dictionaries--no more confusion as to whether an \"apteryx\" is, in fact, an animal (it is: 19 points), or what the acceptable term is for someone who has received a vaccine (a \"vaccinee\": 15 points).The Official Scrabbler Brand Word-Finder reflects changes to the last three editions of The Official Scrabbler Dictionary, and is updated with the most current additions to the Scrabbler lexicon with fun new words like \"yo\" and \"ab.\" Whether you're new to the game or a seasoned pro, the Word-Finder is an indispensable tool for becoming a more successful player.",

        "Description": "The ultimate guide to predicting winners and losers in high technology  Pip Coburn became famous for writing some of the liveliest reports on Wall Street. He quoted everyone from Machiavelli to HAL, Ana\u00efs Nin to Yoda, Einstein to Gandhi. But along with the quirky writing, he consistently delivered sharp insights into technology trends and helped investors pick stocks with long-term potential.   After years of studying countless winners and losers, Coburn has come up with a simple idea that explains why some technologies become huge hits (iPods, DVD players, Netflix), but others never reach more than a tiny audience (Segways, video phones, tablet PCs). He says that people are only willing to change when the pain of their current situation outweighs the perceived pain of trying something new.   In other words, technology demands a change in habits, and that\u2019s the leading cause of failure for countless cool inventions. Too many tech companies believe in \"build it and they will come\"? build something better and people will beat a path to your door. But, as Coburn shows, most potential users are afraid of new technologies, and they need a really great reason to change.   The Change Function is an irreverent look at how this pattern plays out in countless sectors, from computers to cell phones to digital TV recorders. It will be an invaluable book for people who create and invest in new technologies.",

        "Description": "How To Bake is as necessary and essential as a good oven; it is the most comprehensive and accessible guide to baking available in English. In a single, illustrated volume, Nick Malgieri, one of America's preeminent bakers and baking teachers, leads cooks through the simple art of creating an international assortment of delicious sweet and savory baked goods.  Here are the best recipes for breads, including such quick ones as Buttermilk Corn Bread, Irish Soda Bread, Classic Southern Biscuits, and Currant Tea Scones, as well as such delicious yeast-risen breads as Italian Bread Rings, Swiss Rye Bread, Challah, and English Muffins. Malgieri also offers recipes for savory treats like Old-Fashioned Chicken Pie, Pepper and Onion Frittata Tart, Cheese Quiche, and Rosemary Focaccia; and for sweet pastries ranging from puff pastries--Apple Turnovers, Banana Feuillet\u00e9s with Caramel Sauce, Brioches, Strawberry Savarin, and Croissants--to pies and tarts, cobblers, and cookies of every stripe--drop, bar, rolled, and filled; brownies, macaroons, and rugelach. Cakes, too, are here, from layered to rolled, from angel to devil's food.  The recipes in How to Bake are clear and methodical. Master recipes explain all the steps to making a classic dish. They are frequently followed by creative variations so that the baker's palate and skills will always be accommodated and challenged. Start out with a simple spice cake, for example, and transform it, under Malgieri's reassuring guidance, into a lavishly decorated celebration cake.  In addition to an exhaustive and tempting selection of recipes, Malgieri offers clear, detailed instructions, interweaving techniques and helpful sidebars: how to make a pastry bag out of parchment paper; what baking pans to buy; mastering pie and cake toppings; learning to decorate a cake so it looks as if it came from the bakery; and scores of other helpful tips. All this is punctuated with precise explanatory illustrations and thirty-two pages of luscious color photographs to inspire and guide the baker. How to Bake is a one-volume \"bible\" for bakers.",

        "Description": "\"Somehow, we all must eat. we can make indifferent meals, with little connection to where the food comes from. Or we can make meals that are cooked in harmony with the earth and with the seasons, and which are a recurring source of renewal, satisfaction, and celebration. The wine country just seems to require this kind of cooking, and that is part of why I love it.\" -- From the Foreword  Northern California is on the same latitude as many of the countries of the Mediterranean, and award-winning chef Joanne Weir's cooking embodies the vivid flavors of that region. In this book, Weir shares 150 new recipes from the second season of her acclaimed public television series, Weir Cooking in the Wine Country, presented with all the warmth, enthusiasm, skill, and flair that has made her a household name.  Weir's style of cooking and serving changes throughout the year, celebrating the bounty of the field, the orchard, the pasture, the river, and the sea with simple, boldly flavored dishes inspired by the freshest ingredients of the season. Enhanced by more than 45 color and black-and- white photographs, this spectacular volume explores the vivid and varied tastes of California with a feast of Mediterranean dishes that are certain to delight you with their exceptional flavors.  From starters to desserts, Weir has created a bounty of delectable recipes, expertly explained. A first course of Grilled Bread with Fava Beans and Escarole or Endive with Gorgonzola, Caramelized Onions, and Fig Jam brings friends and family to the table. Creamy Fennel Soup chases the autumn chill, while Roasted Yellow Pepper, Corn, and Tomato Soup is the essence of late summer. Try the Stone Fruit Summer Salad when peaches and plums are at their juicy best, and the True Blue Salad on a cool evening. Main courses are deeply flavored: Chicken Rolled with Fontina, Prosciutto, and Sage; Braised Leg of Lamb with Artichokes, with Lemon and Garlic-Roasted Potatoes; Moroccan Spice-Dusted Salmon with Lemon Mint Yogurt. Tempting options for dessert include Double Chocolate Custard, Summer Cherry and Apricot Galette with Kirsch Cream, Upside-Down Pear Gingerbread, Polenta Shortbread, and Ginger Ice Cream with Chocolate-Covered Almonds. There are also suggestions for the right wine to pair with each dish.  No matter where you make your home, you can bring the pleasures of the wine country to your table.",

Lay down the rules. Lighten up, already! - There's got to be a balance -- and there is. Joining their expertise with the wisdom of MOPS International (Mothers of Preschoolers), Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend help you provide both the care and acceptance that make grace real to your child, and the firmness and discipline that give direction. Avoiding the twin extremes of permissiveness and over-control, Drs. Cloud and Townsend show how you can help your child cultivate six necessary character traits: attachment, responsibility, reality, competence, morality, and worship/spiritual life. - At last, here is an effective middle ground for raising up children who will handle life with maturity and wisdom. Raising Great Kids will help you equip your son or daughter to accept life's responsibilities, grow from its challenges, and freely and fully explore all that it has to offer.",
