        "Description": "For daring to peer into the heart of an adulteress and enumerate its contents with profound dispassion, the author of Madame Bovary was tried for \"offenses against morality and religion.\" What shocks us today about Flaubert's devastatingly realized tale of a young woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence of its prose (marvelously captured in the English translation of Francis Steegmuller), and its creation of a world whose minor figures are as vital as its doomed heroine. In reading Madame Bovary, one experiences a work that remains genuinely revolutionary almost a century and a half after its creation.",

        "Description": "Ever since 9/11, many have considered al Queda to be the leading threat to global security, but falling water tables in countries that contain more than half the world's people and rising temperatures worldwide pose a far more serious threat. Spreading water shortages and crop-withering heat waves are shrinking grain harvests in more and more countries, making it difficult for the world's farmers to feed 70 million more people each year. The risk is that tightening food supplies could drive up food prices, destabilizing governments in low-income grain-importing countries and disrupting global economic progress. Future security, Brown says, now depends on raising water productivity, stabilizing climate by moving beyond fossil fuels, and stabilizing population by filling the family planning gap and educating young people everywhere.If Osama bin Laden and his colleagues succeed in diverting our attention from the real threats to our future security, they may reach their goals for reasons that even they have not imagined.",

How can you tie a knot in a napkin by holding one end in each hand without letting go of it? Impossible, you say (or your friends will say, if you bet them). But: Cross your arms and hold a tip of the napkin in each hand. When you uncross your arms, the knot will be formed! Now try this riddle: I climbed up a cherry tree, where I found cherries. I did not pick cherries, nor did I leave cherries. How can you explain this? Answer: I climbed up a cherry tree with two cherries in my hand. I picked only one. I left the other one on the tree. I did not \"pick cherries,\" because I \"picked a cherry.\" Take this dare: My bird can fly faster than any supersonic plane. Here's how: If you put my bird inside any plane and make it fly in the same direction as the plane, it will go faster than the plane.  96 pages, 52 b/w illus., 5 3/8 x 8 1/4.",

These questions have puzzled us since the dawn of time, but when it became apparent to Jon Stewart and the writers of The Daily Show that the world was about to end, they embarked on a massive mission to write a book that summed up the human race: What we looked like; what we accomplished; our achievements in society, government, religion, science and culture -- all in a tome of approximately 256 pages with lots of color photos, graphs and charts.  After two weeks of hard work, they had their book.  EARTH (The Book) is the definitive guide to our species.  With their trademark wit, irreverence, and intelligence, Stewart and his team will posthumously answer all of life's most hard-hitting questions, completely unburdened by objectivity, journalistic integrity, or even accuracy.  Also available as an ebook and as an audiobook.",

        "Title": "Pinheads and Patriots: Where You Stand in the Age of Obama",
        "Authors": "By O'Reilly, Bill",
        "Description": "While the changes that took place in America during President Obama's first eighteen months in office are dizzying to even think about, their real-life impact on the average American is a helluva lot stronger than that. Blood pressures have soared and tempers have reached the boiling point over the shifts in health care, immigration, national security, energy, and the environment-and then there's the economy. The President and his administration have gotten folks riled. But some greedy Wall Streeters. Through it all. Bill O'Reilly can be counted on to cut through the rhctoric and tell you what's good and what's bad for you.So which of these moves have been Pinheaded ones and which have been Patriotic?O'Reilly sorts it all out with his trademark mix of humor and bluster in his most impassioned book to date. He's just the person to turn to in transformative times like these. And this is just the book to guide you through the most important issues of the midterm elections and beyond.When Bill O'Reilly interviewed then-Senator Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential elections, the two had a lively debate about the nation's future.Since that time, America has changed rapidly-some would even say seismically. And many believe these shifts are doing more than just rocking the political and social climate; they're rocking the American core.What are these changes? Who, in addition to President Obama, have been the biggest forces behind them? What exactly do they mean for you, the everyday American citizen? How are they affecting your money, health, safety, freedom, and standing in this nation?Which are Pinheaded moves and which are truly Patriotic? In his latest spirited book, O'Reilly prompts further debate with the President and the American people on the current state of the union.After five consecutive, no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is megabestsellers, you can count on Bill to offer blunt and constructive political commentary. And as he did in his popular memoir, he offers some introspection too, looking back at his own actions and those of past Pinheads and Patriots who have inspired a code of conduct for such taxing times.As always, O'Reilly is fair, balanced, and uncompromisingly tough when guarding the American way. Only Pinheads would fail to fight for what they love most about this country or to embrace some measure of change to make it better. The rest of us Patriots will read this book to discover the difference between the two.",

        "Title": "Even Silence Has an End: My Six Years of Captivity in the Colombian Jungle",
        "Authors": "By Betancourt, Ingrid",
        "Description": "Ingrid Betancourt tells the story of her captivity in the Colombian jungle, sharing powerful teachings of resilience, resistance, and faith.   Born in Bogot\u00e1, raised in France, Ingrid Betancourt at the age of thirty-two gave up a life of comfort and safety to return to Colombia to become a political leader in a country that was being slowly destroyed by terrorism, violence, fear, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. In 2002, while campaigning as a candidate in the Colombian presidential elections, she was abducted by the FARC. Nothing could have prepared her for what came next. She would spend the next six and a half years in the depths of the jungle as a prisoner of the FARC. Even Silence Has an End is her deeply personal and moving account of that time. Chained day and night for much of her captivity, she never stopped dreaming of escape and, in fact, succeeded in getting away several times, always to be recaptured. In her most successful effort she and a fellow captive survived a week away, but were caught when her companion became desperately ill; she learned later that they had been mere miles from freedom.  The facts of her story are astounding, but it is Betancourt's indomitable spirit that drives this very special account, bringing life, nuance, and profundity to the narrative. Attending as intimately to the landscape of her mind as she does to the events of her capture and captivity, Even Silence Has an End is a meditation on the very stuff of life-fear and freedom, hope and what inspires it. Betancourt tracks her metamorphosis, sharing how in the routines she established for herself-listening to her mother and two children broadcast to her over the radio, daily prayer-she was able to do the unthinkable: to move through the pain of the moment and find a place of serenity.  Freed in 2008 by the Colombian army, today Betancourt is determined to draw attention to the plight of hostages and victims of terrorism throughout the world and it is that passion that motivates Even Silence Has an End. The lessons she offers here-in courage, resilience, and humanity-are gifts to treasure.",

The Savage manifesto you hold in your hands shows how Obama is circumventing the Constitution to push through his radical agenda\u00f9and, most important, how we can restore our country to the power and prestige that Barack Obama and his corrupt and degenerate \"czars\" are trying to destroy.The Naked Marxist can and must be stopped. Obama's trickle up poverty is infecting all that we hold to be true and self-evident. Here's how:Impoverishing The Middle Class: Obama's confiscatory taxes, the socializing of our health-care system, and other legislative initiatives are taking away our earnings and our power to choose how we live our lives and putting it in the hands of corrupt and pro-Socialist cohorts.Erasing Our Border With Mexico: The Homeland Security department that can't shoot straight is gutting the Constitution in the name of protecting illegal aliens when it should be focusing on keeping out the terrorists and drug dealers.Defunding The Military And Putting Our Troops In Harm's Way: Obama's beatnik policy of taking apart our nuclear arsenal and destroying NASA, while implementing PC Rules of Engagement that don't allow our troops to protect themselves, is dangerously weakening our security and ending our military dominance.Lining The Pockets Of His Wall Street Buddies: While our 401(k)'s suffer, Obama and his Wall Street heavy contributors are creating their own legislation that is driving down stock prices while allowing his biggest campaign contributors to make trillions of dollars.Propagandizing The Media: Once a forum for free speech, Obama's administration has systematically overrun the media in a hostile takeover with threats and false promises that serve only to pull the wool over the sheeple's eyes.Ignoring The Tea Party\u00f9the Voice Of The People: No longer a representative government, Obama is blatantly disregarding, and even suppressing, the fastest-growing collective voice in the nation right now\u00f9that of the patriotic Tea Party. His Union-Crony Purple Shirts have shown up at town-hall meetings and peaceful protests to intimidate and antagonize the democratic process.We Are Dangerously Close To Losing The Nation We Love, But It's Not Too Late.

        "Description": "The edited, annotated diary of President Jimmy Carter--filled with insights into his presidency, his relationships with friends and foes, and his lasting impact on issues that still preoccupy America and the worldEach day during his presidency, Jimmy Carter made several entries in a private diary, recording his thoughts, impressions, delights, and frustrations. He offered unvarnished assessments of cabinet members, congressmen, and foreign leaders; he narrated the progress of secret negotiations such as those that led to the Camp David Accords. When his four-year term came to an end in early 1981, the diary amounted to more than five thousand pages. But this extraordinary document has never been made public--until now. By carefully selecting the most illuminating and relevant entries, Carter has provided us with an astonishingly intimate view of his presidency. Day by day, we see his forceful advocacy for nuclear containment, sustainable energy, human rights, and peace in the Middle East. We witness his interactions with such complex personalities as Ted Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, Joe Biden, Anwar Sadat, and Menachem Begin. We get the inside story of his so-called \"malaise speech,\" his bruising battle for the 1980 Democratic nomination, and the Iranian hostage crisis. Remarkably, we also get Carter's retrospective comments on these topics and more: thirty years after the fact, he has annotated the diary with his candid reflections on the people and events that shaped his presidency, and on the many lessons learned. Carter is now widely seen as one of the truly wise men of our time. Offering an unprecedented look at both the man and his tenure, this fascinating book will stand as a unique contribution to the history of the American presidency.",

        "Authors": "By Blair, Tony",
        "Description": "Tony Blair is a politician who defines our times. His emergence as Labour Party leader in 1994 marked a seismic shift in British politics. Within a few short years, he had transformed his party and rallied the country behind him, becoming prime minister in 1997 with the biggest victory in Labour's history, and bringing to an end eighteen years of Conservative government. He took Labour to a historic three terms in office as Britain's dominant political figure of the last two decades.A Journey is Tony Blair's firsthand account of his years in office and beyond. Here he describes for the first time his role in shaping our recent history, from the aftermath of Princess Diana's death to the war on terror. He reveals the leadership decisions that were necessary to reinvent his party, the relationships with colleagues including Gordon Brown, the grueling negotiations for peace in Northern Ireland, the implementation of the biggest reforms to public services in Britain since 1945, and his relationships with leaders on the world stage---Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Vladimir Putin, George W. Bush. He analyzes the belief in ethical intervention that led to his decisions to go to war in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and, most controversially of all, in IraqA Journey is a book about the nature and uses of political power. In frank, unflinching, often wry detail, Tony Blair charts the ups and downs of his career to provide insight into the man as well as the politician and statesman. He explores the challenges of leadership, and the ramifications of standing up, clearly and forcefully, for what one believes in. He also looks ahead, to emerging power relationships and economies, addressing the vital issues and complexities of our global worldFew British prime ministers have shaped the nation's course as profoundly as Tony Blair, and his achievements and his legacy will be debated for years to come. Here, uniquely, we have his own journey, in his own wordsTony Blair became an MP in 1983, leader of the Labour Party in 1994, and was prime minister of the United Kingdom from May 1997 to June 2007. Since leaving office, he has served as the Quartet Representative to the Middle East, representing the U.S., the UN, Russia, and the EU in working with the Palestinians to prepare for statehood as part of the international community's effort to secure peace. In May 2008 he launched the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, which promotes respect and understanding among the major religions. His Africa Governance Initiative works with leaders and their governments on policy delivery and attracting sustainable investment in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. He also works with world leaders to build consensus on an international climate-policy framework.",

        "Title": "Threads West: An American Saga (Threads West, An American Saga Series)",
        "Authors": "By Rosenthal, Reid Lance",
        "Description": "Book One - the #1 bestselling Threads West-winner of eight national awards in the categories of Historical Fiction, Romance and Western. This is the namesake novel of the sweeping Threads West, An American Saga multi-era series compared by reviewers and authors to Lonesome Dove, Centennial, and Louis L'Amour. Called by some The Gone With The Wind of the West and applauded by others as rings true and poignant, as authentic and moving as Dances with Wolves. The tale bursts with the adventure, romance and promise of historical America and the West.   You will recognize the characters who live in these pages.  They are the ancestors of your friends, your neighbors, your co-workers, and your family.  They are you. They are us.  This is not only their story. It is our story.  The epic saga of Threads West, An American Saga begins in 1854 with the first of five, richly textured, complex generations of unforgettable, multicultural characters. The separate lives of these driven men and independent women from Europe and America are drawn to a common destiny that beckons seductively from the wild and remote flanks of the American West. Swept into the dangerous currents of the far-distant frontier by the mysterious rivers of fate, the power of the land and the American spirit, their journeys are turbulent quests intertwined with romance and adversity, passions and pathos, despair and triumph.   One thousand miles to the west of St. Louis lies the lawless untamed spine of the continent, the Rocky Mountains. Their energy draws this vanguard of generations to love and struggle in the beautifully vibrant but unforgiving landscape of the West. The personal conflicts inherent to these brave, passion-filled characters are exacerbated by a nation in transition, the budding enmity between North and South, broken treaties with Native Americans and the accelerating melting pot of diverse cultures that marks this magical moment in American history.   The touchstones of the past are the guideposts to the future. This is the first novel of this epic saga-the tale of America, set in the West-the stirring story of many threads of uncommon cultures, differing origins and competing ambitions that entwine into the American spirit. Lives and generations are woven on the loom of history, propelled by fate and freedom to form the tapestry that becomes the whole cloth of the nation. It is uniquely American, this meld of the mosaic.   In Book Two, Maps of Fate, the heroic but conflicted men and women of Threads West continue their dangerous journeys, pushing relentlessly westward, their paths intersecting with the trails of others, setting in motion generational liaisons that cannot be foreseen.   Momentous change will continue, igniting further greed and compassion, courage and treachery, rugged independence, torrid passions and fierce loyalties. The decades of the Maps of Fate era novels of Threads West, An American Saga book series become the crucible of the souls of generations, the building of the heart of the nation, the destiny of a people, and the relentless energy and beauty of the western landscape. This is the ongoing story of us. Set in authentic locations on three continents and in the jagged peaks of the Rocky Mountains, the life threads of the characters -- whose personalities are forged on the anvil of the land and shaped by the spirit of America -- live, love, struggle, die, fail and succeed. They have neither country nor culture in common -- but the textured, complex and conflicted lives of these independent men and women become part of the fabric of the undulating landscape of the West, and are woven into the rich and adventurous tapestry of an emerging nation and the ever evolving American spirit. The adventure and romance of America, her people and her spirit and the West. This is not only their story. It is our story. It is Threads West, An American Saga.",

Millions of jobs worldwide have vanished forever. Did Bible prophecy predict this catastrophe? Are there biblical clues to how soon, if ever, a viable, long-term recovery can be sustained?

        "Description": "\"A brilliant narrative that keeps the reader spellbound from beginning to end. James Swanson's vivid style and historical accuracy are unsurpassed, and he makes the parallel journeys of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis come magically alive. I wish I had written this book.\"---Edward Steers Jr., author of Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln and The Lincoln Assassination EncyclopediaOn the morning of April 2, 1865, Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, received a telegram from General Robert E. Lee. There is no more time---the Yankees are coming, it warned. Shortly before midnight, Davis boarded a train from Richmond and fled the capital, setting off an intense and thrilling chase in which Union cavalry hunted the Confederate president.Two weeks later, President Lincoln was assassinated, and the nation was convinced that Davis was involved in the conspiracy that led to the crime. Lincoln's murder, autopsy, and White House funeral transfixed the nation. His final journey began when soldiers placed his corpse aboard a special train that would carry him home on the 1,600-mile trip to Springfield. Along the way, more than a million Americans looked upon their martyr's face, and several million watched the funeral train roll by. It was the largest and most magnificent funeral pageant in American history.To the Union, Davis was no longer merely a traitor. He became a murderer, a wanted man with a $100,000 bounty on his head. Davis was hunted down and placed in captivity, the beginning of an intense and dramatic odyssey that would transform him into a martyr of the South's Lost Cause.The saga that began with Manhunt continues with the suspenseful and electrifying Bloody Crimes. James Swanson masterfully weaves together the stories of two fallen leaders as they made their last expeditions through the bloody landscape of a wounded nation.",

        "Authors": "By Reich, Robert B.",
        "Description": "A brilliant new reading of the economic crisis\u2014and a plan for dealing with the challenge of its aftermath\u2014by one of our most trenchant and informed experts.When the nation\u2019s economy foundered in 2008, blame was directed almost universally at Wall Street. But Robert B. Reich suggests a different reason for the meltdown, and for a perilous road ahead. He argues that the real problem is structural: it lies in the increasing concentration of income and wealth at the top, and in a middle class that has had to go deeply into debt to maintain a decent standard of living.Persuasively and straightforwardly, Reich reveals how precarious our situation still is. The last time in American history when wealth was so highly concentrated at the top\u2014indeed, when the top 1 percent of the population was paid 23 percent of the nation\u2019s income\u2014was in 1928, just before the Great Depression. Such a disparity leads to ever greater booms followed by ever deeper busts. Reich\u2019s thoughtful and detailed account of where we are headed over the next decades reveals the essential truth about our economy that is driving our politics and shaping our future. With keen insight, he shows us how the middle class lacks enough purchasing power to buy what the economy can produce and has adopted coping mechanisms that have a negative impact on their quality of life; how the rich use their increasing wealth to speculate; and how an angrier politics emerges as more Americans conclude that the game is rigged for the benefit of a few. Unless this trend is reversed, the Great Recession will only be repeated. Reich\u2019s assessment of what must be done to reverse course and ensure that prosperity is widely shared represents the path to a necessary and long-overdue transformation. Aftershock is a practical, humane, and much-needed blueprint for both restoring America\u2019s economy and rebuilding our society.",

Despite a prickly relationship and very different lives, they've never quite lost touch with each other - or with their former teacher, Libor Sevick, a Czechoslovakian always more concerned with the wider world than with exam results.Now, both Libor and Finkler are recently widowed, and with Treslove, his chequered and unsuccessful record with women rendering him an honorary third widower, they dine at Libor's grand, central London apartment.It's a sweetly painful evening of reminiscence in which all three remove themselves to a time before they had loved and lost; a time before they had fathered children, before the devastation of separations, before they had prized anything greatly enough to fear the loss of it. Better, perhaps, to go through life without knowing happiness at all because that way you had less to mourn? Treslove finds he has tears enough for the unbearable sadness of both his friends' losses.And it's that very evening, at exactly 11:30pm, as Treslove hesitates a moment outside the window of the oldest violin dealer in the country as he walks home, that he is attacked. After this, his whole sense of who and what he is will slowly and ineluctably change.The Finkler Question is a scorching story of exclusion and belonging, justice and love, aging, wisdom and humanity. Funny, furious, unflinching, this extraordinary novel shows one of our finest writers at his brilliant best.",

        "Title": "Debt-Free U: How I Paid for an Outstanding College Education Without Loans, Scholarships, or Mooching off My Parents",
        "Authors": "By Bissonnette, Zac and Tobias, Andrew (FRW)",
        "Description": "This book can save you more than $100,000. These days, most people assume you need to pay a boatload of money for a  quality college education. As a result, students and their parents are  willing to go into years of debt and potentially sabotage their entire  financial futures just to get a fancy name on their diploma. But Zac Bissonnette is walking proof that this assumption is not only  false, but dangerous-a class con game designed to rip you off and doom  your student to a post-graduation life of near poverty . From his unique  double perspective-he's a personal finance expert (at Daily Finance)  AND a current senior at the University of Massachusetts-Zac figured out  how to get an outstanding education at a public college, without  bankrupting his parents or taking on massive loans. Armed with  his personal knowledge, the latest data, and smart analysis, Zac takes  on the sacred cows of the higher education establishment. He reveals why  a lot of the conventional wisdom about choosing and financing college  is not only wrong but hazardous to you and your child's financial  future. You'll discover, for instance, that: * Student loans  are NOT a necessary evil. Ordinary middle class families can- and must-find  ways to avoid them, even without scholarships. * College  \"rankings\" are useless-designed to sell magazines and generate hype. If  you trust one of the major guides when picking a college, you face a  potential financial disaster. * The elite graduate programs  accept lots of people with non-elite bachelors degrees. So do America's  most selective employers. The name on a diploma ultimately won't help  your child have a more successful career or earn more money. Zac can prove every one of those bold assertions - and more. No matter  what your current financial situation, he has a simple message for  parents: \"RELAX! Your kid will be able to get a champagne education on a  beer budget!\"",

Arianna Huffington is right: it's not too late for citizens to wake up politicians of to take matters into their own hands. Time is short: read this book now.\"\u00f9Elizabeth Warren, Harvard Law School professor and author of The Two-Income Trap\"Luckily for Congress, the White House, and corporate America, no one reads anymore, because if people discover this book, America will become a very different place.\"\u00f9Bill Maher, Host of Real Time with Bill Maher\"Restoring the values that have made America strong-a thriving middle class and a sense of basic fair play-are of crucial importance to all Americans, left and right. Third World America is a powerful plea for our country to wake up so that we can change course-before it's too late.\"\u00f9Joe Scarborough, host of Morning Joe\"Politicians talk endlessly about 'protecting the middle class,' yet, over the last thirty years, the middle class has taken a relentless pounding. In precise, graphic, and shocking terms that will bring the crisis home to everyone, Arianna Huffington explains why: special interests have become too powerful, money dominates our politics... The national spirit that builds America lies in tatters. Turning this situation around will require strong new leadership. How long will that take? That depends on you-read this book and push hard for change.\"\u00f9Simon Johnson, Professor of economics at MIT Sloan School of Management and coauthor of 13 Bankers\"Arianna Huffington is one of the very few people in America committed to say things the way they are and to expose the monstrous elephants in the room ignored by the dominant discourse. Even rarer, she does so in a lively, engaging, and, mostly, charming way.\"\u00f9Nassim Nicholas TALEB, author of The Black Swan\"Blending outrage and optimism- indignation at how america's crony capitalists have wrecked the nation's great middle class, and unremitting hope that our people will rise and put things right-she explains what's happened and what must be done.

The United States of America is in danger of becoming a Third World nation.The evidence is all around us: Our industrial base is vanishing, taking with it the kind of jobs that have formed the backbone of our economy for more than a century; our education system is in shambles, making it harder for tomorrow's workforce to acquire the information and training it needs to land good twenty-first-century jobs; our infrastructure\u00f9roads, bridges, water, and electrical systems\u00f9is crumbling; our economic system has been reduced to recurring episodes of Corporations Gone Wild; our political system is broken, in thrall to a small financial elite using the power of the checkbook to control both parties.And America's middle class, the driver of so much of our economic success and political stability, is rapidly disappearing, forcing us to confront the fear that we are slipping as a nation\u00f9that our children and grandchildren will enjoy fewer opportunities and face a lower standard of living than we did.It's the dark flipside of the American Dream\u00f9an American Nightmare of our own making.Arianna Huffington, editor in chief of the must-read Huffington Post, has her finger on the pulse of America and unflinchingly tracks the gradual demise of the nation as an industrial, political, and economic leader. In the vein of her fiery bestseller Pigs at the Trough, Third World America points fingers, names names, and details who's killing the American Dream.Calling on the can-do attitude that is part of America's DNA, Huffington shows precisely what we need to do to stop our free fall and keep our country from turning into a Third World nation.Third World America is required reading for anyone who is disturbed by our country's steady descent from twentieth-century superpower to backwater banana republic.",

        "Description": "\"In Leavy's hands, the life of Mantle no longer defies logic: it seems invitable, She's hit a long home run.\"---Publishers Weekly (starred review) \"A masterpiece of sports biography.\"---Booklist (starred review)Mickey Mantle's sweater hangs on the door to my office. I put it there the day I decided to write this book... It has followed me from closet to closet and house to house since he gave it to me twenty-seven years ago. I packed it away in an old garment bag right after I said goodbye to him. I thought I was done with the Mick.---from the prefaceJane Leavy, the acclaimed author of the New York Times bestseller Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy, returns with a biography of an American original---number 7, Mickey Mantle, Drawing on more than five hundred interviews with friends and family, teammates, and opponents, she delivers the definitive account of Mantle's life, mining the mythology of The Mick for the true story of a luminous and illustrious talent with an achingly damaged soul.Meticulously reported and elegantly written, The Last Boy is a baseball tapestry that weaves together episodes from the author's weekend with The Mick in Atlantic City, where she interviewed her hero in 1983, after he was banned from baseball, with reminiscences from friends and family of the boy from Commerce, Oklahoma, who would lead the Yankees to seven world championships, be voted the American League's Most Valuable Player three times, win the Triple Crown in 1956, and duel teammate Roger Maris for Babe Ruth's home run crown in the summer of 1961---the same boy who would never grow up.As she did so memorably in her biography of Sandy Koufax, Jane Leavy transcends the hyperbole of hero worship to reveal the man behind the coast-to-coast smile, who grappled with a wrenching childhood, crippling injuries, and a genetic predisposition to alcoholism. In The Last Boy she chronicles her search to find out more about the person he was and, given what she discovers, to explain his mystifying hold on a generation of baseball fans, who were seduced by that lopsided, gap-toothed grin. It is an uncommon biography, with literary overtones: not only a portrait of an icon, but an investigation of memory itself. How long was the Tape Measure Home Run? Did Mantle swing the same way right-handed and left-handed? What really happened to the red-haired, freckle-faced boy known back home as Mickey Charles?\"I believe in memory, not memorabilia,\" Leavy writes in her preface. But in The Last Boy, she discovers that what we remember of our heroes---and even what they remember of themselves---is only where the story begins.",

Ora, a  middle-aged Israeli mother, is on the verge of celebrating her son Ofer\u2019s release from army service when he returns to the front for a major offensive. In a fit of preemptive grief and magical thinking, she sets out for a hike in the Galilee, leaving no forwarding information for the \u201cnotifiers\u201d who might darken her door with the worst possible news. Recently estranged from her husband, Ilan, she drags along an unlikely companion: their former best friend and her former lover Avram, once a brilliant artistic spirit. Avram served in the army alongside Ilan when they were young, but their lives were forever changed one weekend when the two jokingly had Ora draw lots to see which of them would get the few days\u2019 leave being offered by their commander\u2014a chance act that sent Avram into Egpyt and the Yom Kippur War, where he was brutally tortured as  POW. In the aftermath, a virtual hermit, he refused to keep in touch with the family and has never met the boy. Now, as Ora and Avram sleep out in the hills, ford rivers, and cross valleys, avoiding all news from the front, she gives him the gift of Ofer, word by word; she supplies the whole story of her motherhood, a retelling that keeps Ofer very much alive for Ora and for the reader, and opens Avram to human bonds undreamed of in his broken world. Their walk has a \u201cwar and peace\u201d rhythm, as their conversation places the most hideous trials of war next to the joys and anguish of raising children. Never have we seen so clearly the reality and surreality of daily life in Israel, the currents of ambivalence about war within one household, and the burdens that fall on each generation anew. Grossman\u2019s rich imagining of a family in love and crisis makes for one of the great antiwar novels of our time.",

        "Description": "\"[Smith] takes what in essence is a police procedural and elevates it to the level of absorbing fiction.\"---Nicholas A. Basbanes, Los Angeles Times\"Martin Cruz Smith Knows his Russia. Every page reeks of Moscow: dirty snow, the stink of cigarette and vodka fumes, the cynicism and tasteless opulence of the mafia, the all-pervasive corruption.\"---The Economist\"The sustained success of Smith's Renko books is based on much more than Renko. This author's gift for tart, succinct description creates a poisonous political backdrop, one that makes his characters' survival skills as important as any of their other attributes. [This is] one top-flight series, still sharply honed, none the worse for wear.\"---Janet Maslin, The New York Times\"There are few thriller practitioners indeed who can weld a story to a graceful chassis of literature and send it barreling away at top speed. Martin Cruz Smith is one of them.\"---Andrew Z. Galarneau, The Buffalo News\"As always, Smith elevates a police procedural story to a taste of Russia, a glass of vodka poured quivering to the brim.\"---Jennifer Kay, Associated PressA passenger train hurtling through the night. An unwed teenage mother headed to Moscow to seek a new life. A cruel-hearted soldier looking furtively, forcibly, for sex. An infant disappearing without a trace.So begins Martin Cruz Smith`s masterful Three Stations, a suspenseful, intricately constructed novel featuring Investigator Arkady Renko. For the last three decades, beginning with the trailblazing Gorky Park, Renko (and Smith) have captivated readers with detective tales set in Russia. Renko is the ironic, brilliantly observant cop who finds solutions to heinous crimes when other lawmen refuse to even acknowledge that crimes have occurred. He uses his biting humor and intuitive leaps to fight not only wrongdoers but the corrupt state apparatus as wellIn Three Stations, Renko`s skills are put to their most severe test. Though he has been technically suspended from the prosecutor's office for once again turning up unpleasant truths, he strives to solve a last case: the death of an elegant young woman whose body is found in a construction trailer on the perimeter of Moscow's main rail hub. It looks like a simple drug overdose to everyone---except to Renko, whose examination of the crime scene turns up some inexplicable clues, most notably an invitation to Russia's premier charity ball, the billionaires' Nijinksy Fair. Thus a sordid death becomes interwoven with the lifestyles of Moscow's rich and famous, many of whom are clinging to their cash in the face of Putin's crackdown on the very oligarchs who placed him in powerRenko uncovers a web of death, money, madness and a kidnapping that threatens the woman he is coming to love and the lives of children he is desperate to protect. In Three Stations, Smith produces a complex and haunting vision of an emergent Russia's secret underclass of street urchins, greedy thugs and a bureaucracy still paralyzed by power and fear.",
