Each chapter includes an action plan--actual assignments for the reader to complete as part of the process of gaining confidence, improving self-esteem, and increasing dating opportunities. Readers are asked to apply the same principles to finding a mate that have gotten them ahead in business: planning, perseverance, effort, and time.This results-oriented book teaches you that wanting a relationship is nothing to be ashamed of, that staying in a dead-end relationship will keep you from finding a thriving one, that there are simple and effective ways to increase the odds of meeting the right kind of people, and that you're a good catch and you shouldn't hide it.How Not to Stay Single presents a unique plan of action for finding that elusive, emotionally fulfilling attachment. It shows you how to stop waiting for a relationship and how to start making it happen. Unlike other relationship books, this book is about changing what you're doing, not about changing you.",

With the stories of ordinary men and women accomplishing the extraordinary, Rather demonstrates how the American dream brings us together and guides us, as it has for more than 200 years.For some, the American dream is simply to own a home or rise out of poverty. Some wish to serve God, country, or community. There are those who want to learn to read or run their own business. Still others simply wish to exercise fundamental American rights: to openly practice their religion and to speak what is in their minds and hearts.Stirring and provocative, The American Dream illustrates that the basic American desire for \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" is alive and well. It also confirms what our founding fathers always believed: that we are a country of visionaries, in ways big and small.",

Erica Langston's comfortable home and loving family living near Washington, D.C., carry no outward hint of the sorrows and fears faced by her Acadian forebears, but she will soon discover that similar determination and fortitude will be required of her. When the British once again invade the nation's capital and leave death and destruction in their wake, Erica is left to deal with the creditors circling around the crumbling family business. It seems her only recourse is to travel to England to collect on outstanding debts held in British banks. Arriving in London at the home of the United States ambassador, Erica is gradually immersed in a secret mission that brings her face-to-face with her most feared and reviled enemy. She discovers that Gereth Powers is part of a group of Christian activists headed up by William Wilberforce himself. Along the way, Erica comes to realize her faith has been more cultural than real, and her spiritual journey becomes far more signi?cant than her journey over the ocean.",

Many women realize they must leave behind the traditional concepts and images for a more authentic spirituality. Yet they find to their dismay that the male symbols of God are deeply rooted in their psyches, and difficult to transform. A God Who Looks Like Me shows how the patriarchal images of early experience have wounded women and still stand in the way of a self-defined spirituality.In this book, the poignant personal memories of women of all ages and lifestyles are interwoven with the collective story of women buried in the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Bible. Together, these women explore the lost glory of Eve, Lilith, and Mary - and of other forgotten figures who speak to our lives in a society that prefers men. They teach us to plumb the depths of our relationships with our mothers, our bodies, and ourselves; our sexuality and vulnerability; and our journey into old age. As they glimpse in themselves and in each other the feminine faces of God, they can begin to heal.",

Nearly a century later Bessie's granddaughter, Faro Gaulden, is listening to a lecture on genetic inheritance. She has returned to the depressed little town in which Bessie grew up and wonders at the families who never left. Confronted with what would have been her life had her grandmother stayed, she finds herself faced with difficult questions. Is she really so different from the South Yorkshire locals? As she soon learns, the past has a way of reasserting itself-not unlike the peppered moth that was once thought to be nearing extinction but is now enjoying a sudden unexplained resurgence. The Peppered Moth is a brilliant novel, full of irony, sadness, and humor.",

But they often focus on crisis management and imply that there is an \"end\" to mourning, and fail to acknowledge grief\u2019s ongoing impact and how it changes through the years. \u201cThis is a book about death and grief, yes, but more important, it is a book about love and hope. I have learned from my experience and interviews with courageous people about pain, struggle, resiliency, and meaning. Their stories show over time, you can learn to transcend even in spite of the pain.\u201d\u2014from the introduction by Ashley Davis Bush, LCSW",

        "Description": "Few people know the absurdities of American politics better than Jeff Greenfield, CNN's award-winning political and media analyst. Now for all those millions of Americans who are still trying to figure how we got there, Greenfield takes us behind the scenes to explore Election Night 2000, the campaign that produced it, and the tumultous weeks that followed it, and their surreal glory. From the long election battle itself (\"between a candidate who spoke to us as if English were his second language and a candidate who spoke to us as if English was our second language\") to November 7 and its famous media flipflops (\"Oh, waiter!\" Greenfield proclaimed aloud. \"One order of crow!\") to its hard-fought finale, he leads us through an Alice-in-Wonderland world of butterfly ballots and hanging chads; Nader factors and newsroom hysteria (\"You know the woodcut? Munch? The Scream? That's what it was like\"); deadlines, Doomsday scenarios, and \"Dukakis states\"; lawyers, recounts, spin doctors, Skutnicks, glitches, Zones, bad numbers and botched assumptions (\"There was no thought - none - given to the possibility that Gore might win the popular and lose the electoral vote,\" said a Gore insider).",

        "Title": "Now or Never: How Companies Must Change to Win the Battle for Internet Consumers",
        "Authors": "By Modahl, Mary",
        "Description": "The battle for the 21st century is now clear: inside, traditional brick and mortar companies are digging in for the fight of their lives; outside, a tightening circle of dot.com upstarts threaten to transform every feature of the economy. Is the war over already? Mary Modahl thinks not; instead, she anticipates that the coming five years will be decisive--which is why companies that want to stay alive and thrive must act Now or Never. The key to success in the brave new world of e-commerce is a deep and nuanced understanding of how consumers think about and use the Internet. Forrester Research--the world's most respected technology research firm--has developed that understanding in a groundbreaking model of consumer behavior called Technographics. For the firsttime ever, Now or Never shares the Technographics model with business people outside Forrester's exclusive client list.Built on interviews with more than 250,000 Americans, Technographics divides consumers into ten sharply identified segments based on differing attitudes toward the Internet. That means each segment will use e-commerce in a different way and dive into buying on-line at a different pace.Using Technographics, businesspeople--from companies that are small or large, established or brand new, traditional or dot.com--will be able to plot a well-reasoned, robust Internet strategy.Beyond Technographics, the book also identifies and explains the startling, counterintuitive new business models that drive competition on the web. Now or Never introduces the concept of Dynamic Trade, a term that Forrester coined to describe the disruptive new way business gets done on the web. With engaging prose that is chock-full of real stories, Modahl describes how Dynamic Trade changes the balance of supply and demand, requires companies to ramp up to scale faster ever, and zeroes out marginal cost.As the battle for Internet dominance reaches a crisis, Now or Never stands apart. Written by a straight-talking business practitioner who knows and understands the Internet as well as anyone working today, this groundbreaking book confronts the most pressing business issue of our time with reasoned answers to the questions on the mind of every informed executive:When will the Internet change the way I do business?Why is the Internet transforming everything about the economy and competition? How exactly will my industry and company change, in terms of customers, competitors, cash flow, and the bottom line?                    ANDWhat should I do about it right now?",

        "Title": "Little Girl Lost",
        "Authors": "By Joseph, Leisha and Mendenhall, Deborah Bruner",
        "Description": "\"All of my Bible heroes are survivors. I guess all of the people I have met in my life and I consider to be my heroes are survivors...This book is the story of a survivor. It is the story of a remarkable young woman who did not allow herself to be a victim but became a survivor. She did not look for social issues or society to blame but turned her violation and hurt into something positive, not only for her but for all of the people in her life. This is a story of God's love and grace and a lesson of life...Little Girl Lost is her story's title but the story of her life should be called 'Little Girl Triumphant.'\"--From the Foreword by Nicky CruzThe events of Leisha Joseph's life are sensational, but the deeper story lies in her relationship to God, and in what she can now teach others who suffer from the fear and hurt that result from violence and trauma.As the treasured only daughter of an upper-middle-class family, Leisha, as well as her brothers, enjoyed a happy childhood. When she was eight years old, all this changed abruptly with the death of her father. The strain on her mother manifested itself in wild behavior. In between frequent stays in private mental hospitals, she brought home a string of boyfriends, some of whom preferred children and made their way to Leisha's bed. After trying to burn down the house and chasing Leisha with a kitchen knife, her mother was confined to the state mental hospital. While friends and family lent a hand, it was largely up to Leisha and her brothers to keep the family intact.Sadly, Leisha experienced the pain of isolation because of her family situation. She found God as a teenager, but that comfort did not last long. Leisha became disillusioned with Christianity and began taking drugs until an overdose had her on her knees, promising to serve God all her life if He saved her. She was sober in an instant, and has kept her promise.Just when she had managed to turn her life around and was a finalist in the Miss Teen USA pageant, recently graduated with honors from high school, and engaged to marry a godly young man, Leisha experienced an attack at the hands of a serial rapist. Yet God intervened once more, giving her the words that would save her life and would eventually cause her attacker to confess in court. Even when he escaped and came after her, as he had threatened to do, Leisha refused to let fear dominate her life. She rejected the advice of the Witness Protection Program, instead relying on God's saving hands.",

But what if you could immerse yourself in the world of the musician, where creating and performing is a profound task, and yet as routine as breathing? When writer Carl Vigeland was invited to tour with Wynton Marsalis and his septet, he was able to do just that. Vigeland's acute observations sweep us into their world as he becomes virtually part of the band. At the same time, Marsalis offers intimate meditations on home, family, creation, and performance--written in the cadence of his inimitable voice. Set on the stage, in the studio, and in great cities and small towns around the world, this richly textured narrative explores how the music is made in America today.",

Seizing the chance to be innovators instead of cogs in the Microsoft machine, this intrepid bunch strike out on their own to form a high-tech start-up company named Oop! in Silicon Valley. Living together in a sort of digital flophouse --\"Our House of Wayward Mobility\" -- they desperately try to cultivate well-rounded lives and find love amid the dislocated, subhuman whir and buzz of their computer-driven world.   Funny, illuminating and ultimately touching, Microserfs is the story of one generation&#39;s very strange and claustrophobic coming of age.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations",

        "Description": "Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Marcel Proust and Virginia Woolf, Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy, Louis Armstrong and Mae West, Woody Allen and Dorothy Parker--these are but a few of the figures who have given voice to our century's most memorable quotations. Now, in The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations, A.J. Augarde gathers together 6,000 of the best known quotes from our time, drawn from novels, plays, poems, essays, speeches, films, radio and television, songs, and even advertisements.    Here readers will find the history-making quotes, from Churchill's stirring wartime speeches (\"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\"), to Neville Chamberlain's infamous \"Peace for our time,\" to Spiro T. Agnew's outrageous \"If you've seen one city slum you've seen them all.\" On the lighter side, readers will enjoy such wits as Woody Allen (\"It's not that I'm afraid to die. I just don't want to be there when it happens\"), Fran Lebowitz (\"Food is an important part of a balanced diet\"), and Dorothy Parker (\"This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force\"). There are generous excerpts from literature, from the novels of Hemingway and Joyce, the poetry of Auden, Eliot, and Pound, the plays of Lillian Hellman and Anita Loos, and the lyrics of Irving Berlin and Cole Porter (\"In olden days a glimpse of stocking / Was looked on as something shocking / Now, heaven knows, / Anything goes\"). Augarde also includes famous book titles (such as Shepherd Mead's \"How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\"), song titles (Larry Morey's \"Whistle While You Work\"), even cartoon captions (Bill Maudlin's wartime \"I feel like a fugitive from the law of averages\"). And of course, the book brims with wisdom, from Count Ciano's \"Victory has a hundred fathers, but defeat is an orphan,\" to Lord Morley's \"You have not converted a man because you have silenced him,\" to Alfred Adler's \"It is always easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.\" Designed both for reference and for browsing, the Dictionary arranges quotations in alphabetical order by author, with attributions after each quote so that readers can explore the original quotes in context. In addition, the index helps the reader trace quotations from their most important keywords, so that if you know the quote but not the author, you can still find it easily.  Whether you want to find out who first used the expression \"a walk on the wild side\" (it was Nelson Algren) or simply enjoy discovering fine turns of phrase or witty remarks (such as Beatrice Lillie's off-the-cuff comment to a waiter who spilled soup on her dress: \"Never darken my Dior again\"), The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations offers a unique view of the twentieth century through some of its most memorable lines.",

He looks into the recent past of the dead man and finds a life lived at the edges. Once a promising rookie, Herb Frawley saw his career take a nosedive after several seasons. Why the abrupt decline? Is it somehow linked to Frawley's death?Hired by Frawley's ex-wife, Branco begins a case that takes him from the Manhattan offices of a big-time sports agent, through the seedy world of Coney Island grifters, to a religious colony on the Jersey Shore. The focus of his investigation becomes an old ballpark vendor whom Branco locates in a Florida rest home. The old man's chaotic memories of a bygone era of baseball land Branco in a thirty-year-old mystery involving pornography, betrayal, and murder.But is he up to solving it? He left the cops after being shot in the line of duty, but his wound goes far deeper than the pain it still causes him, and he must continually probe at the underlying failure it implies. Now time has come full circle, and Branco uncovers a devastating secret that puts him into a ninth-inning situation from which there may be no escape.",

McPherson on the rush to enlist to fight in the Civil War, Witold Rybczynski on the building of Central Park, Gina Kolata on the worldwide influenza epidemic of 1918, Nicholas Lemann on the \"great migration\" of Southern blacks to Northern cities, Tom Brokaw on the World War II generation, Norman Podhoretz on the rise of neoconservatism, Leonard Garment on Watergate, Richard Holbrooke on the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, and much more.
