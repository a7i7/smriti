In other words, it's a great time to be in the banking business.Maxed Out takes us on a road trip that is sometimes hysterical and often horrifying: from Las Vegas to the Bible Belt, from the backwoods to inner cities, where the world's largest financial giants troll for their next victims. Welcome to a country populated by debt pirates, corporate predators, human credit card billboards, debt evangelists, megamillion-dollar spec homes, and, of course, trillions of dollars of easy credit.Combining startling facts with even more startling examinations of individuals, institutions, the government, and modern religion, James Scurlock separates the myths (there is \"good debt\" and \"bad debt\") from the harsh reality (corporations partner with colleges to target today's youth; credit reports are riddled with errors that will never be fixed; and death, for many of those in trouble, is the only way out).At a time when the financial industry posts ever-higher profits even as its clients drown in the flood of easy credit, Scurlock exposes very real, potentially disastrous systems and policies that are consuming millions of Americans. Maxed Out takes readers on a wickedly smart and entertaining tour of what one interviewee calls \"the last taboo.\"",

        "Description": "The Battle For Control Of Iran . . . Begins In SpaceWhen a disgraced former Iranian military chief of staff engineers an insurgency that threatens to destroy the theocratic regime in Iran, a new era appears to be dawning in the Middle East. But one must be wary of old enemies . . .On the run from the Pasdaran, the theocrat's terror army, and unable to count on support from his friends in the regular army, Iranian rebel leader General Hesarak al-Kan Buzhazi desperately turns to his old nemesis, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant-General Patrick McLanahan, for help. Unwilling to commit American forces in an Iranian civil war, and with time running out, the U.S. president authorizes McLanahan to utilize a new, top-secret fleet of globe-crossing spaceplanes, the XR-A9 Black Stallions, led by test pilot and astronaut Captain Hunter Noble. Within hours, McLanahan's Air Battle Force turns the tide, possibly changing the course of history in the Middle East for generations.The advent of almost instantaneous global reach, along with the reactivation of America's first military space station, Silver Tower, has rekindled fears of a space arms race, and the growing insurgency in Iran is threatening to erupt into a worldwide jihad. But McLanahan finds himself embroiled in even more bitter battles at the White House, between those who support his space-based military initiative and those who are working secretly to undermine it. When McLanahan is forced to concentrate on his political and personal battles back at home, it's left to Hunter Noble and his team of young American space engineers to keep the fires of freedom in the Middle East from exploding completely out of control. Filled with the latest cutting-edge weaponry, geopolitical intrigue, high-flying suspense, and a colorful cast of characters, Strike Force is New York Times bestselling master Dale Brown at his best.",

        "Description": "For decades, Clive Cussler has been delighting readers with novels filled with suspense, action, and sheer audacity. Now he does it again, in one of the wildest, most entertaining historical thrillers in years.  April 1950: The rusting hulk of a steam locomotive rises from the deep waters of a Montana lake. Inside is all that remains of three men who died forty-four years before. But it is not the engine or its grisly contents that interest the people watching nearby. It is what is about to come next . . .  1906: For two years, the western states of America have been suffering an extraordinary crime spree: a string of bank robberies by a single man who cold- bloodedly murders any and all witnesses and then vanishes without a trace. Fed up by the depredations of the \"Butcher Bandit,\" the U.S. government brings in the best man they can find-a tall, lean, no-nonsense detective named Isaac Bell, who has caught thieves and killers coast to coast.  But Bell has never had a challenge like this one. From Arizona to Colorado to the streets of San Francisco during its calamitous earthquake and fire, he pursues what is quickly becoming clear to him is the sharpest criminal mind he has ever encountered, and the woman who seems to hold the key to the bandit's identity. Using science, deduction, and intuition, Bell repeatedly draws near only to grasp at thin air, but at least he knows his pursuit is having an effect. Because his quarry is getting angry now, and has turned the chase back on him. The hunter has become the hunted. And soon it will take all of Isaac Bell's skills not merely to prevail . . . but to survive.  Filled with intricate plotting, dazzling signature set pieces, and not one but two extraordinary villains, this is the work of a master writing at the height of his powers.",

If only life were that simple.Unfortunately, he has bigger fish - or in Sin's case, demons - to fry. The lethal gallu that were buried by his pantheon are now stirring, and they are hungry for human flesh. Their goal is to destroy mankind and anyone else who gets in their way.

Now a man who knows only betrayal must trust the one person most likely to hand him to the demons. Artemis may have stolen his godhood, but this one has stolen his heart. The only question is: Will she keep it or feed it to the ones who want him dead?",

For years, no remedy--not orthodontia, not the escalating threats of his father, Mike, a washed-out linebacker turned sporting goods entrepreneur, not the noxious cayenne pepper-based Suk-No-Mor--can cure Justin's thumbsucking habit.Then a course of hypnosis seemingly does the trick, but true to the conservation of neurotic energy, the problem doesn't so much disappear as relocate. Sex, substance abuse, speech team, fly-fishing, honest work, even Mormonism--Justin throws himself into each pursuit with a hyperactive energy that even his daily Ritalin dose does little to blunt.Each time, however, he discovers that there is no escaping the unruly imperatives of his self and the confines of his deeply eccentric family. The only \"cure\" for the adolescent condition is time and distance.Always funny, sometimes hilariously so, occasionally poignant, and even disturbing, deeply wise on the vexed subject of fathers and sons, Walter Kirn's Thumbsucker is an utterly fresh and all-American take on the painful process of growing up.",

With twin  daughters finishing high school, a son at Dartmouth, and a kindergartner from her  second marriage, there seems to be no challenge to which Olympia cannot rise. Until  one sunny day in May, when she opens an invitation for her daughters to attend the  most exclusive coming-out ball in New York\u2013and chaos erupts all around her.  One  twin\u2019s excitement is balanced by the other\u2019s outrage; her previous husband\u2019s profound  snobbism is in sharp contrast to her current husband\u2019s flat refusal to attend.  For  Olympia\u2019s husband, Harry, whose parents survived the Holocaust, the idea of a blue-blood  debutante ball is abhorrent. Her daughter Veronica, a natural-born rebel, agrees\u2013 while Veronica\u2019s identical twin, Virginia, is already shopping for the perfect dress.  Then there\u2019s Olympia\u2019s ex, an insufferable snob, who sees the ball as the perfect  opportunity for a family feud. And amid all the hubbub, Olympia\u2019s college-age son,  Charlie, is facing a turning point in his life\u2013and may need his mother more than  ever.  But despite it all, Olympia is determined to steer her family through the  event until, just days before the cotillion, things begin to unravel with alarming  speed.  From a son\u2019s crisis to a daughter\u2019s heartbreak, from a case of the chicken  pox to a political debate raging in her household, Olympia is on the verge of surrender.  And that is when, in a series of startling choices and changes of heart, family,  friends, and even a blue-haired teenager all find a way to turn a night of calamity  into an evening of magic.  As old wounds are healed, barriers are shattered and new  traditions are born, and a debutante ball becomes a catalyst for change, revelation,  acceptance, and love.  In a novel that is by turns profound, poignant, moving, and  warmly funny, Danielle Steel tells the story of an extraordinary family\u2013finding new  ways of letting go, stepping up, and coming out...in the ways that matter most.",

Dr. Karp has found there IS a remedy for colic. \u201cI share with parents techniques known only to the most gifted baby soothers throughout history \u2026and I explain exactly how they work.\u201dIn a innovative and thought-provoking reevaluation of early infancy, Dr. Karp blends modern science and ancient wisdom to prove that newborns are not fully ready for the world when they are born. Through his research and experience, he has developed four basic principles that are crucial for understanding babies as well as improving their sleep and soothing their senses:The Missing Fourth Trimester: as odd as it may sound, one of the main reasons babies cry is because they are born three months too soon.The Calming Reflex: the automatic reset switch to stop crying of any baby in the first few months of life.The 5 \u201cS\u2019s\u201d: the simple steps (swaddling, side/stomach position, shushing, swinging and sucking) that trigger the calming reflex. For centuries, parents have tried these methods only to fail because, as with a knee reflex, the calming reflex only works when it is triggered in precisely the right way. Unlike other books that merely list these techniques Dr. Karp teaches parents exactly how to do them, to guide cranky infants to calm and easy babies to serenity in minutes\u2026and help them sleep longer too.The Cuddle Cure: the perfect mix the 5 \u201cS\u2019s\u201d that can soothe even the most colicky of infants.In the book, Dr. Karp also explains:What is colic?Why do most babies get much more upset in the evening?How can a parent calm a baby\u2014in mere minutes?Can babies be spoiled?When should a parent of a crying baby call the doctor?How can a parent get their baby to sleep a few hours longer?Even the most loving moms and dads sometimes feel pushed to the breaking point by their infant\u2019s persistent cries. Coming to the rescue, however, Dr. Karp places in the hands of parents, grandparents, and all childcare givers the tools they need to be able to calm their babies almost as easily as\u2026turning off a light.",

While each young man dealt with the turmoil caused by an absent father, with no male role model to turn to for advice, each veered dangerously close to a life of delinquency, drugs, and crime. But despite great odds, the three overcame the statistics. In high school, they formed the Pact, a promise to one another that they would become doctors, and it kept them dedicated to one another and to their dream, and helped to put them on the road to successful careers as physicians.  In The Bond, the Three Doctors plumb their own tough childhoods to explore the national epidemic of fatherlessness. But rather than cling to any bitterness or pain they may have felt as children about their fathers' inability to be in their lives, as adults Davis, Jenkins, and Hunt sought out their fathers and worked to reconnect with them. In the doctors' own words-and their fathers'-they describe the crucial lessons they learned, identifing ways to stem the tide of fatherlessness that's sweeping through communities across the country. Honest, brave, and poignant, The Bond is a book for every family, every father, and every man.",

In 1982, when he was four years old, Kamran Nazeer was enrolled in a small school in New York City alongside a dozen other children diagnosed with autism. Calling themselves the Idiots, these kids received care that was at the cutting edge of developmental psychology. Twenty-three years later, the school no longer exists.Send in the Idiots is the always candid, often surprising, and ultimately moving investigation into what happened to those children. Now a policy adviser in England, Kamran decides to visit four of his old classmates to find out the kind of lives that they are living now, how much they've been able to overcome\u2014and what remains missing. A speechwriter unable to make eye contact; a messenger who gets upset if anyone touches his bicycle; a depressive suicide victim; and a computer engineer who communicates difficult emotions through the use of hand puppets: these four classmates reveal an astonishing, thought-provoking spectrum of behavior. Bringing to life the texture of autistic lives and the pressures and limitations that the condition presents, Kamran also relates the ways in which those can be eased over time, and with the right treatment. Using his own experiences to examine such topics as the difficulties of language, conversation as performance, and the politics of civility, Send in the Idiots is also a rare and provocative exploration of the way that people\u2014all people\u2014learn to think and feel. Written with unmatched insight and striking personal testimony, Kamran Nazeer's account is a stunning, invaluable, and utterly unique contribution to the literature of what makes us human.",

        "Title": "The Camino: A Journey of the Spirit",
        "Authors": "By MacLaine, Shirley",
        "Description": "It has been nearly three decades since Shirley MacLaine commenced her brave and public commitment to chronicling her personal quest for spiritual understanding. In testament to the endurance and vitality of her message, each of her eight legendary bestsellers -- from Don't Fall Off the Mountain to My Lucky Stars -- continues today to attract, dazzle, and transform countless new readers. Now Shirley is back -- with her most breathtakingly powerful and unique book yet.  This is the story of a journey. It is the eagerly anticipated and altogether startling culmination of Shirley MacLaine's extraordinary -- and ultimately rewarding -- road through life. The riveting odyssey began with a pair of anonymous handwritten letters imploring Shirley to make a difficult pilgrimage along the Santiago de Compostela Camino in Spain. Throughout history, countless illustrious pilgrims from all over Europe have taken up the trail. It is an ancient -- and allegedly enchanted -- pilgrimage. People from St. Francis of Assisi and Charlemagne to Ferdinand and Isabella to Dante and Chaucer have taken the journey, which comprises a nearly 500-mile trek across highways, mountains and valleys, cities and towns, and fields. Now it would be Shirley's turn.  For Shirley, the Camino was both an intense spiritual and physical challenge. A woman in her sixth decade completing such a grueling trip on foot in thirty days at twenty miles per day was nothing short of remarkable. But even more astounding was the route she took spiritually: back thousands of years, through past lives to the very origin of the universe. Immensely gifted with intelligence, curiosity, warmth, and a profound openness to people and places outside her own experience, Shirley MacLaine is truly an American treasure. And once again, she brings her inimitable qualities of mind and heart to her writing. Balancing and negotiating the revelations inspired by the mysterious energy of the Camino, she endured her exhausting journey to Compostela until it gradually gave way to a far more universal voyage: that of the soul. Through a range of astonishing and liberating visions and revelations, Shirley saw into the meaning of the cosmos, including the secrets of the ancient civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria, insights into human genesis, the essence of gender and sexuality, and the true path to higher love.  With rich insight, humility, and her trademark grace, Shirley MacLaine gently leads us on a sacred adventure toward an inexpressibly transcendent climax. The Camino promises readers the journey of a thousand lifetimes.",

        "Title": "Life Out of Bounds: Bioinvasion in a Borderless World (Worldwatch Environmental Alert)",
        "Authors": "By Bright, Chris",
        "Description": "Bioinvasion - the spread of alien, \"exotic\" organisms - is gnawing away at ecosystems all over the world, largely unnoticed and unopposed. The continuing increase in travel and trade around the globe is fostering the spread of more and more invaders of almost every conceivable description, from highly flammable weeds to human pathogens and forest diseases.Chris Bright tracks the extent and explains the dangers of bioinvasion - an environmental threat that may now be surpassed only by habitat loss in its potential to irreparably damage our planet. Bright explores the counterintuitive mechanisms of invasion, in which the addition of a non-native species to an area tends to reduce that area's biodiversity. He shows that bioinvasions are not only destroying ecosystems, but also endangering public health, disrupting the cultures of traditional forest and fishing peoples, and costing our economies billions of dollars a year.The current rates of invasion, Bright argues, are no more sustainable over the long term than are current rates of deforestation or greenhouse gas emissions. Yet according to Bright, we already have the knowledge and tools necessary to resist or roll back bioinvasions. He outlines a counter-invasion strategy that stretches from international legal reform to on-the-ground control techniques. And, recognizing that the principal challenge may not be so much technical as cultural, he calls for a higher degree of ecological literacy - an appreciation of the value of native plants and animals, and an ability to \"read\" landscapes well enough to see the invaders within them.",

        "Description": "New York Times bestselling author of The Wordy Shipmates and contributor to NPR\u2019s \"This American Life\" Sarah Vowell embarks on a road trip to sites of political violence, from Washington DC to Alaska, to better understand our nation\u2019s ever-evolving political system and history.Sarah Vowell exposes the glorious conundrums of American history and culture with wit, probity, and an irreverent sense of humor. With Assassination Vacation, she takes us on a road trip like no other -- a journey to the pit stops of American political murder and through the myriad ways they have been used for fun and profit, for political and cultural advantage.  From Buffalo to Alaska, Washington to the Dry Tortugas, Vowell visits locations immortalized and influenced by the spilling of politically important blood, reporting as she goes with her trademark blend of wisecracking humor, remarkable honesty, and thought-provoking criticism. We learn about the jinx that was Robert Todd Lincoln (present at the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley) and witness the politicking that went into the making of the Lincoln Memorial. The resulting narrative is much more than an entertaining and informative travelogue -- it is the disturbing and fascinating story of how American death has been manipulated by popular culture, including literature, architecture, sculpture, and -- the author's favorite -- historical tourism. Though the themes of loss and violence are explored and we make detours to see how the Republican Party became the Republican Party, there are all kinds of lighter diversions along the way into the lives of the three presidents and their assassins, including mummies, show tunes, mean-spirited totem poles, and a nineteenth-century biblical sex cult.",

That means wizardry is near.\"  There is a vast difference between wizardry and sorcery, a difference embodied in the conflict between the shadowy immortals Mauryl and Hasufin.  Tristen is a weapon in the at ancient war. A summoning and a shaping, brought to life by the wizard Mauryl, Tristen has yet to see his first winter, though he has the shape and the memory of a young man.  And the sword is a weapon as well. Its keen blade, marked  Illusion on one side and  Truth on the other, helped the young king Cefwyn secure the throne of Ylesuin and gained Tristen the stewardship of Amefel, a country that has paid dearly for its resistance to the barbarism of wizard war.  Tristen&#39;s rule in Amefel is blessed with two extraordinary friends: one a stalwart and simple warrior, the other with more than a drop of aetheling royal blood. But the scarlet banners of war are unfolding again, and far more than a kingdom is at stake.  Cefwyn&#39;s dream of a united Ylesuin and a love match with Niv\u00e9vrise is threatened by ambitious lords and narrow religionist to whom all magic is evil. The \"sparrows\" of Elwynor are gathering on the border, pitiful refugees from the gathering storm.  And Tristen must take up the sword and the Sihh\u00e9 magic he has forsworn. For he is destiny&#39;s own, created a combatant in a far older and more fearsome conflict than any ever imagined by mere mortal man.  Following her acclaimed Fortreess in the Eye of Time and Fortress of Eagles, C. J. Cherryh&#39;s newest high fantasy triumph continued the soaring tale of the  primordial struggle between darkness and light.  Fortress of Owls is a worthy and essential addition to this awesome fantasy epic, set  in a world as rich with wonder, as plagued by violence, and for those with eyes to see, far more real than our own.   The Blade, Illusion, Flashed in the Dim Light...  Naked, sword in hand, Tristen faced the window into the shadowed night and saw all the town of Henas&#39;amef flared up in Lines. There were al the wards, all the magic of craftsmen and householders warding their own doors and walls; the common magic of parents and homekeepers and the pure trust of children...all these things Unfolded to him in that unworldly glow, block by block, house by  house, outward toward the great defensive wall of Henas&#39;amef itself, a bright blue Line often retraced and constantly tended. Something had challenged them  But they held. For now, they held...",

When the government refuses to either rescue him or negotiate for his release, Belknap decides to take matters into his own hands.Meanwhile, hedge fund analyst Andrea Bancroft gets a surprising call - she is to receive an unexpected bequest of six million dollars from a cousin she never met. With one condition -- she must agree to sit on the board of the Bancroft family foundation, a charitable organization that is run by the family patriarch, Paul Newton. Having never been involved with, or even met, the family - her mother was briefly married to an Bancroft and cut off all contact many years ago - Andrea is intrigued. But the foundation, which is dedicated to doing strategic good deeds, appears less and less benign the more deeply involved she gets. What exactly is their involvement with the \"Genesis\" - a mysterious group working to destabilize the geopolitical balance at the risk of millions of lives? As events escalate, Todd Belknap and Andrea Bancroft come together and must form an uneasy alliance if they are to uncover the truth behind \"Genesis\" -- before it is too late.",

It's ideal for him, his partner Aileen, and her three children. Even the attic space seems just right -- the perfect place for a game room or a children's retreat.   But as Matt and his decorator tour the property, they find something that will put the attic off-limits for a long time to come: a tiny child's skeleton that has clearly been there for years. What happened to the child, and how did its skeleton get into the attic?  Detective Sergeant Charlie Peace and his forensic team think the child's remains have been in the attic for thirty years. Thirty years? Matt remembers that time. It was 1969 and he was seven years old. He was in the neighborhood, spending the summer with an aunt. That was the summer that Elderholm's owner left her house empty when she went to visit a daughter in Australia.  What happened that summer? What memories lie deep in Matt's consciousness? Where are the other children from that summer who now, of course, are adults? Who killed the little child and why was he or she never reported missing? And who has now written to Matt, assuring him that he had no part in what occurred, that he had gone home to London before it happened?  As Matt struggles to recover his memory of that strange summer, both he and Charlie Peace ponder what it means to love and lose a child and how one thoughtless decision can change a life forever.  Richly evocative and deeply poignant, The Bones in the Attic is crime writing at its best from one of the great contemporary masters of mystery.",

        "Description": "Fragile Innocence is the story of a child devastated by pure chance. This moving narrative of a father\u2019s journey to understand and accept the profound changes in his daughter\u2019s life is at once memoir, biography, mystery, and drama, all centered around one remarkable young woman who cannot talk or read or understand language, but who has touched almost everyone she has ever met.At eighteen months Hillary Reston, a happy, healthy toddler, was struck by a remarkably high fever. On the advice of her doctor, her parents, James Reston, Jr., and Denise Leary, administered Tylenol and anxiously waited for the fever to subside. Five days later it did, but the damage was done. Over the course of the next five months their bubbly, highly verbal child was radically and irrevocably changed. Worse yet, no doctor could explain what evil and still unidentified force had stolen Hillary\u2019s ability to speak or understand language, hurtled her into a seemingly endless cycle of seizures, destroyed her kidneys, and taken her to the very brink of death.For her parents, discovering what had happened to their child and how to assure the quality of her life became an obsession. This quest for answers would take them from the nation\u2019s hospitals to the office of a pioneering geneticist in Texas and the vaulted halls of the National Institutes of Health.This very intimate story also personalizes some of the most daunting ethical issues of medicine that society faces today, including stem cell research, animal organ transplantation, diagnosis with the Human Genome Map, and reproductive and therapeutic cloning. Hillary gives these immensely complicated issues a human face, and they are pondered by Reston as a reporter, a thinker, and a father. In Fragile Innocence author James Reston, Jr., invites us inside his family, candidly sharing the joys and sorrows of raising Hillary.\u201cThis is a book about the first twenty-one years of a child named Hillary. It tells of her battle to live and our family\u2019s struggle to help her survive as best we could, after an evil and still unidentified force robbed her of her language at the age of two, hurtled her into a seemingly endless cycle of brain storms, destroyed her kidneys, and took her to the very brink of death. That is the first half of the story, when life itself was at stake.\u201d \u2014From the Preface",

In 1756 Giacomo Casanova escapes from a Venetian prison and resurfaces in the Italian village of Bolzano. Here he receives an unwelcome visitor: the aging but still fearsome Duke of Parma, who years before had defeated Casanova in a duel over a ravishing girl named Francesca and spared his life on condition that he never see her again. Now the duke has taken Francesca as his wife\u2014and intercepted a love letter from her to his old rival. Rather than kill Casanova on the spot, he makes him a startling offer, one that is logical, perverse, and irresistible. Turning an historical episode into a dazzling fictional exploration of the clasp of desire and death, Casanova in Bolzano is further proof that S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai is one of the most distinctive voices of the twentieth century.",
