Environmentalists warn that trade liberalization will increase demand for raw materials, overburdening natural ecosystems. The trade community\u2019s concerns focus on the danger of protectionism masquerading as environmental action. In the past ten years a number of multilateral agreements to protect the environment have been signed with authority apart from GATT\u2019s. What body of international law and which institutions should preside over the colliding interests covered by the different agreements? C. Ford Runge, a leading expert on trade reform and environmental policy, explores the linkages between trade and environment, and compares trade rules and environmental standards. He also looks at the economic harm done to consumers and producers of restricted goods. How can environmental harm be reduced and international trade be expanded with minimal detriment to the other? Runge examines actual cases and concludes with specific policy recommendations for the United States and the international community.",

It just may be the Marine Corps.Far from being the hidebound, autocratic entity that most people imagine, the Corps has created a stunningly nimble, almost freewheelingly adaptive organization. The result: Though often faced with extraordinarily dynamic and complex challenges, the Marines get the job done every time.Their secret? Don't think boot camp. Instead, the Marines have refined a wide-ranging system of management practices that have undergone continuous evolution under the most demanding conditions conceivable. Armed with these straightforward principles, any organization can achieve the high-impact responsiveness demanded by today's ultra-competitive, fast-changing business environments.In Corps Business, author David H. Freedman brings these principles--and their application to the business world--to light in clear, fascinating form. Freedman brings you along to observe, firsthand the high-speed Marine environment, where you'll take part in urban combat practice maneuvers, sit in on mission planning sessions, spend time on a \"floating invasion party,\" and participate in a live-fire combat exercise. Along the way, you'll tap the wisdom of scores of Marines from three-star generals to grunts. Here are some examples:Managing by end-state--Tell people what needs to be accomplished and why, and leave the details to them.The 70-percent solution--It's better to decide quickly on an imperfect plan than to spend time considering every angle and roll out a perfect plan when it's too late.Authority on demand--While retaining a strong management pyramid, encourage people even at the lowest levels to make any and all decisions necessary to accomplish the mission when management guidance isn't at hand.Anyone facing entrenched or predatory competitors, short time frames, chaotic markets, and obstacles in every direction, has a simple choice: Learn to move fast, change on the fly, and inspire employees--or die. The Marines are here to help.With a foreword by Gen. Charles C. Krulak, Thirty-first Commandant of the United States Marine Corps.",

        "Description": "Scott Kelby, the man who changed the \"digital darkroom\" forever with his groundbreaking, #1 bestselling, award-winning book The Photoshop Book for Digital Photographers,  now tackles the most important side of digital photography--how to take  pro-quality shots using the same tricks today's top digital pros use  (and it's easier than you'd think).  This entire book is  written with a brilliant premise, and here\u2019s how Scott describes it:  \"If you and I were out on a shoot, and you asked me, 'Hey, how do I get  this flower to be in focus, but I want the background out of focus?' I  wouldn't stand there and give you a lecture about aperture, exposure,  and depth of field. In real life, I'd just say, 'Get out your telephoto  lens, set your f/stop to f/2.8, focus on the flower, and fire away.'  You d say, 'OK,' and you'd get the shot. That's what this book is all  about. A book of you and I shooting, and I answer the questions, give  you advice, and share the secrets I've learned just like I would with a  friend, without all the technical explanations and without all the  techno-photo-speak.\"  This isn't a book of theory\u2014it isn't full  of confusing jargon and detailed concepts: this is a book of which  button to push, which setting to use, when to use them, and nearly two  hundred of the most closely guarded photographic \"tricks of the trade\"  to get you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more  colorful, more professional-looking photos with your digital camera  every time you press the shutter button.  Here's another thing  that makes this book different: each page covers just one trick, just  one single concept that makes your photography better. Every time you  turn the page, you'll learn another pro setting, another pro tool,  another pro trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery  prints. There's never been a book like it, and if you're tired of  taking shots that look \"OK,\" and if you\u2019re tired of looking in  photography magazines and thinking, \"Why don't my shots look like  that?\" then this is the book for you.",

        "Description": "Outrageous, raw, and painfully funny true stories straight from the life of the actor, comedian, and much-loved cast member of The Howard Stern Show\u2014with a foreword by Howard Stern.When Artie Lange joined the permanent cast of The Howard Stern Show in 2001, it was possibly the greatest thing ever to happen in the Stern universe, second only to the show\u2019s move to the wild, uncensored frontier of satellite radio. Lange provided what Stern had yet to find all in the same place: a wit quick enough to keep pace with his own, a pathetic self-image to dwarf his own, a personal history both heartbreaking and hilarious, and an ingrained sense of self-sabotage that continually keeps things interesting. A natural storyteller with a bottomless pit of material, Lange grew up in a close-knit, working-class Italian family in Union, New Jersey, a maniacal Yankees fan who pursued the two things his father said he was cut out for\u2014sports and comedy. Tragically, Artie Lange Sr. never saw the truth in that prediction: He became a quadriplegic in an accident when Artie was eighteen and died soon after. But as with every trial in his life, from his drug addiction to his obesity to his fights with his mother, Artie mines the humor, pathos, and humanity in these events and turns them into comedy classics. True fans of the Stern Show will find Artie gold in these pages: hilarious tales that couldn\u2019t have happened to anyone else. There are stories from his days driving a Jersey cab, working as a longshoreman in Port Newark, and navigating the dark circuit of stand-up comedy. There are outrageous episodes from the frenzied heights of his coked-up days at MADtv, surprisingly moving stories from his childhood, and an account of his recent U.S.O. tour that is equally stirring and irreverent. But also in this volume are stories Artie\u2019s never told before, including some that he deemed too revealing for radio. Wild, shocking, and drop-dead hilarious, TOO FAT TO FISH is Artie Lange giving everything he\u2019s got to give. And like a true pro, the man never disappoints.",

        "Description": "Child expert Jill Rigby reveals the dangers of the self-esteem parenting philosophy and offers an alternative approach that teaches children to respect both themselves and others.After decades of experimenting with child-focused parenting, parents are beginning to realize that the result is often self-centered children who tend toward narcissism, selfishness, mediocrity, and dysfunction. Rigby espouses a new goal of parenting: gently bumping children off self-center and teaching them to be unselfish givers instead. Raising Unselfish Children in a Self-Absorbed World dares to revisit the values of compassion, forgiveness, thanksgiving, and unselfishness and insists that we can instill these values in our children. With her encouraging approach, Rigby helps parents realize it's never too late to change their children's point of view and equip them to interact with kindness and respect in a world outside themselves. Teaching concepts, such as developing a passion for compassion, learning to give by forgiving, and filling every day with thanksgiving, Raising Unselfish Children in a Self-Absorbed World offers a new paradigm for parenting\u2014one that educates the heart and teaches moms and dads how to parent with a new end in mind.",

        "Description": "The breakthrough three-step program that heals the underlying causes of dependency and ends relapse for alcoholics, addicts, and those with addictive behaviors.The Alcoholism and Addiction Cure contains the three-step holistic program to total recovery that is the basis of the miraculous success of Passages Malibu Addiction Cure Center in California, one of the world\u2019s most successful addiction treatment centers. In this revolutionary book, you will learn:* The three steps to permanent sobriety* The four causes of dependency* How to create a personalized, holistic treatment program to completely cure your dependency* How your thoughts, emotions, and beliefs are key factors in your recovery* How to stimulate your body\u2019s self-healing potential to be forever free of dependency\u201cFreedom from dependency starts with understanding that alcohol, drugs, and addictive behaviors are not the real problems,\u201d say Chris and Pax Prentiss, cofounders of Passages Malibu. \u201cAlcohol, street drugs, nicotine, prescription medications, food bingeing, gambling, and the like are merely the substances or behaviors you or your loved ones are using to cope with the real problems\u2014anything from deep emotional pain, ill health, or depression to hypoglycemia, a sluggish thyroid, or brain-wave pattern imbalances. Once the underlying problems are discovered and cured, the need for drugs, alcohol, or addictive behavior will disappear\u2014along with the craving.\u201dChris Prentiss should know. His son Pax was addicted to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol for ten years. They sought help everywhere, but Pax relapsed again and again. In desperation, they finally created their own holistic, hand-tailored program that was a complete break from all other programs and that combined several effective therapies. It saved Pax\u2019s life. Together, father and son founded Passages Malibu to help others find their own freedom.For decades, we\u2019ve been hearing that alcoholism and addiction are incurable diseases, but The Alcoholism and Addiction Cure proves that this is a dangerous myth and that the label of \u201calcoholic\u201d or \u201caddict\u201d destroys the promise of full recovery. Today, thousands are being freed from the old, limiting paradigms by using the groundbreaking approach spelled out in this book. As visionaries and innovators, Pax and Chris Prentiss bring new hope to people everywhere who are dependent on drugs, alcohol, or addictive behaviors.",

        "Description": "Here are the facts:The United States has released 425 terrorists from Guant\u00e1namo, at least 50 of whom have returned to the battlefield to fight our troops.Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both say they're fiscally responsible. But each has called for $1 trillion in tax increases over the next ten years\u2014and dressed them up as tax cuts!Mainstream Media has been given marching orders from the Society of Professional Journalists: never refer to \"Islamic terrorists\" or \"Muslim terrorists.\" And they are obeying! Whenever our brave agents disrupt a terror plot, The media dismisses the culprits as a gang of idiots\u2014lulling us into a false sense of security.If the liberals win the 2008 election, they will cripple talk radio\u2014forcing stations to give equal time to left-wing programs, and insisting that liberals play a key role in station management. Up to a quarter of all state pension funds in the United States are invested in companies that are helping Iran, Syria, North Korea, or the Sudan\u2014for a total of nearly $200 billion.The Do-Nothing Congress is still doing nothing\u2014and the worst offenders are the presidential candidates Clinton, Obama, and McCain, who never show up for their day jobs as senators . . . except to pick up their $165,000 paycheck!Is it any wonder that Americans feel fleeced at every turn?As more and more critical problems develop that need national attention, the White House and Congress appear to be AWOL.Who's calling the shots instead?Big business, big government, big labor, and big lobbyists. And their self-serving agendas are doing nothing to help the ever-increasing number of American people who are losing their homes, paying credit card interest rates higher than 25 percent, and finding their jobs increasingly outsourced to foreign countries.In this hard-hitting call to arms, Dick Morris and Eileen McGann reveal the hundreds of ways American tax-payers are routinely fleeced\u2014by our own government; by foreign countries like Dubai that are gobbling up American interests and spending millions to influence government decisions and American public opinion; by Washington lobbying firms that are pushing the agendas of corrupt foreign dictators on Capitol Hill; and by hedge-fund billionaires collecting huge tax breaks courtesy of the IRS.With their characteristic blend of sharp analysis and insider insight, Morris and McGann call offenders of all kinds on the carpet\u2014and offer practical agendas we all can follow to help turn the tide.",

By chronicling such bravery, John Qui\u00f1ones captures America's can-do spirit and shows that through the slightest good deed, each one of us harbors a hero within.Texas native and veteran ABC journalist John Qui\u00f1ones has traveled the world and the country reporting on hundreds of stories during his illustrious career. Long ago he realized that the stories he was most attracted to had one thing in common\u2014a shared focus on the goodness inherent in ordinary Americans. According to John, truly heroic individuals are people who make difficult choices, even in the face of danger, without giving in to fear. They don't expect fame or money for their efforts\u2014they're just doing the right thing. They are compassionate and courageous, and our world would be a far worse place without them. They rarely get the recognition they deserve.Heroes Among Us means to change that.Along with reporting the many stories of heroes he's met, John also shares his own touching personal narrative of his rise from humble roots as the son of a laborer and a house cleaner to his life as a network anchor. His is one of the most American of stories.Heroes Among Us, in its stories of selflessness, strength and bravery, offers inspiration, ultimately challenging each of us to learn from the great deeds of our neighbors and, in turn, to follow in that same heroic spirit. This is a book to cherish, one whose wisdom will be felt for years to come.",

        "Description": "Gail Collins, New York Times columnist and bestselling author, recounts the astounding revolution in women's lives over the past 50 years, with her usual \"sly wit and unfussy style\" (People).When Everything Changed begins in 1960, when most American women had to get their husbands' permission to apply for a credit card. It ends in 2008 with Hillary Clinton's historic presidential campaign. This was a time of cataclysmic change, when, after four hundred years, expectations about the lives of American women were smashed in just a generation.A comprehensive mix of oral history and Gail Collins's keen research--covering politics, fashion, popular culture, economics, sex, families, and work--When Everything Changed is the definitive book on five crucial decades of progress. The enormous strides made since 1960 include the advent of the birth control pill, the end of \"Help Wanted--Male\" and \"Help Wanted--Female\" ads, and the lifting of quotas for women in admission to medical and law schools. Gail Collins describes what has happened in every realm of women's lives, partly through the testimonies of both those who made history and those who simply made their way.Picking up where her highly lauded book America's Women left off, When Everything Changed is a dynamic story, told with the down-to-earth, amusing, and agenda-free tone for which this belovedNew York Times columnist is known. Older readers, men and women alike, will be startled as they are reminded of what their lives once were--\"Father Knows Best\" and \"My Little Margie\" on TV; daily weigh-ins for stewardesses; few female professors; no women in the Boston marathon, in combat zones, or in the police department. Younger readers will see their history in a rich new way. It has been an era packed with drama and dreams--some dashed and others realized beyond anyone's imagining.",
