        "Authors": "By Stoddard, Alexandra",
        "Description": "For thirty-seven years and in nineteen previous books, Alexandra Stoddard has shared her keen eye for design and sure sense of style. Now this renowned decorator and lifestyle philosopher takes readers to a new level of visual awareness, showing how to achieve the discerning eye that is the key to creating beautiful environments for living. In Open Your Eyes, Alexandra Stoddard shows us how to see with the expertise and clarity of professional designers, creating a home that reflects our individual sense of beauty, refined to its best expression. She reveals how to use daily awareness to educate our eye, sharing examples from the masters and her own extensive training and personal experience. These visual epiphanies can happen anywhere, once we become attuned-perhaps as we set a pretty table, straighten a linen closer, stroll in a park or garden, or browse in a thrift shop. Through Stoddard's anecdotes and a rich array of ideas, tips, and techniques, we learn hundreds of ways to see and solve problems of proportion, pattern, color, and composition through simple, pleasing changes. These may be as subtle as rearranging treasured objects on a table, altering a lamp shade, or moving a chair-but they have dramatic results: a home that is more beautiful, more comfortable, and more useful, reflecting our unique sense of life. Each day becomes a visual feast as we deepen our understanding not only of what makes something beautiful but of what makes something beautiful to us. Filled with the warmth, encouragement, and down-to-earth solutions that have helped hundreds of thousands to seek and find their own personal style, Alexandra Stoddard's Open Your Eyes provides essential tools to elevate our understanding of what makes our house a home and transform our surroundings into personal works of art.

Stoddard shows how to use daily awareness to educate our eye, sharing examples from visual mentors and from her own training and experience. Each day becomes a visual feast as we hone our sensitivity to beauty and our understanding of what makes something beautiful.The author invites us to open our eyes and really see: How many colors are in a sunset? A glass of water? The soap bubbles in the sink? Why does one room look cramped and inharmonious, while another gives the impression of light and space? And how can we use this new vision to create a pleasing, comfortable personal world? In the process of learning to train our eye, Alexandra Stoddard enables us to become the artists of life. With this book in hand, we have all the essential tools to begin transforming our homes and our surroundings into personal works of art.",

        "Title": "The Fortune Tellers: Inside Wall Street's Game of Money, Media, and Manipulation",
        "Authors": "By Kurtz, Howard",
        "Description": "Just as \"spin\" has taken over politics in America, so too has it come to define the long bull market on Wall Street. The booming trade in stocks, which has become a national obsession, has produced an insatiable demand for financial intelligence--and plenty of new, highly paid players eager to supply it. On television and the Internet, commentators and analysts are not merely reporting the news, they are making news in ways that provide huge windfalls for some investors and crushing losses for others. And they often traffic in rumor, speculation, and misinformation that hit the market at warp speed.  Howard Kurtz, widely recognized as America's best media reporter, and the man who revealed the inner workings of the Clinton administration's press operation in the national bestseller Spin Cycle, here turns his skeptical eye on the business-media revolution that has transformed the American economy. He uncovers the backstage pressures at television shows like CNBC's Squawk Box and CNN's Moneyline; at old-media bastions like The Wall Street Journal and Business Week, which are racing to keep up with the twenty-four-hour news cycle; and at Internet start-ups like TheStreet.com and JagNotes, real-time operations in the very arena where fortunes are made and lost with stunning swiftness.  Bombarded by all this white noise, who among the fortune tellers can investors really trust? Kurtz provides an indispensable guide with this eye-opening account of an unseen world, based on eighteen months of shadowing the most influential, colorful, and egotistical people in business and journalism. Among the people we meet in its pages are:     Ron Insana, Maria Bartiromo, David Faber, Lou Dobbs, and the other famous faces of cable TV   The manic king-of-all-media Jim Cramer, who juggles four different identities--Wall Street trader, television commentator, columnist, and Internet entrepreneur --with wildly varying degrees of success   Shoe-leather reporters Steve Lipin, Chris Byron, and Gene Marcial, whose exclusives drive up stocks or quickly deflate them   Superstar analysts Ralph Acampora, Abby Joseph Cohen, and Henry Blodget, whose predictions make the Dow and Nasdaq gyrate   Internet CEOs Kim Polese and Kevin O'Connor, who struggle to ride the media tiger while promoting their high-flying companies   No one has ever reported from inside the Wall Street media machine or laid bare the bitter feuds, cozy friendships, and whispered leaks that move the markets. Kurtz exposes the disturbing conflicts of interest among the brokerage analysts and fund managers whose words can boost or bash stocks --thanks to scoop-hungry journalists who rarely question whether these gurus are right or wrong. And he chronicles the journalistic hype that helped propel Net stocks into the stratosphere until they began plummeting back to earth.  In a time of head-spinning volatility, The Fortune Tellers is essential reading for all of us who gamble our savings in today's overheated stock market.",

He hates the predatory world of sales, but he needs the money to pay for college. Then things go horribly wrong. In a sweltering trailer in rural Florida, a couple whom Lem has spent hours pitching is shot dead before his eyes, and the unassuming young man is suddenly pulled into the dark world of conspiracy and murder. Not just murder: assassination\u2013 or so claims the killer, the mysterious and strangely charismatic Melford Kean, who has struck without remorse and with remarkable good cheer. But the self-styled ethical assassin hadn\u2019t planned on a witness, and so he makes Lem a deal: Stay quiet and there will be no problems. Go to the police and take the fall. Before Lem can decide, he is drawn against his will into the realm of the assassin, a post-Marxist intellectual with whom he forms an unlikely (and perhaps unwise) friendship. The ethical assassin could be a charming sociopath, eco-activist, or vigilante for social justice. To unravel the mystery and save himself, Lem must descend deep into a bizarre world he never knew existed, where a group of desperate\u2013and genuinely deranged\u2013schemers have hatched a plan that will very likely keep Lem from leaving town alive.David Liss skillfully interweaves a gallery of eccentric characters with a multilayered plot characterized by its unpredictable twists and turns. The Ethical Assassin is a brilliant, darkly comic novel that will leave readers in suspense until the very last page.",

On his journey, Karlin lives in two worlds-the world of postwar Vietnam and the world of film. Past and present, illusion and reality, humor and sorrow blend as he works on the film and converses with his former enemies. Particularly powerful are the contrasts between the young and old generations of Vietnamese and the meditative quality of the narrative as Karlin explores the ironies involved in bridging the gap between past and present. For example, we hear the story of the coward who became the national poster boy for patriotism because he is photogenic, and we chuckle when the only extras the director can find to play the American GIs are Russian students. What is reality? What is fiction? What are the consequences of former sacrifice? These are some of the underlying themes explored in the course of this intriguing narrative.",

        "Description": "Increasingly aware of the demand to achieve ever more challenging performance targets, more companies are embarking on Business Process Reengineering (BPR) efforts. Yet, the failure rate is reportedly high. Discontent and second-guessing persists about the very nature of BPR, what it is, and how to implement it successfully.In dispelling the doubts in how to proceed, this book shows CEOs, managers, and BPR team members how to benefit most from BPR implementation. Rather than laying out the authors' own program, it relies upon an in-depth international study of 47 companies that have reduced costs, compressed cycle time, and improved customer service through successful BPR techniques.The research clearly illustrates what's right and what's wrong in the reengineering process and captures the practices and approaches that successful companies have taken. All study participants agree that there are distinctive practices - best practices - that work. These proven best practices, common to companies reaching their goals, form the core of this book.",

        "Description": "In this immensely captivating and imaginative novel, perfectly set at the intersection of fact and fiction, Dan Barden superimposes the story of John Wayne on the story of the Bardens, a family very much like his own. Frank Barden, Wayne's contractor, is an Irish Catholic from New York who has come to California in pursuit of the American dream for his wife, Lillian, and their three young children, Danny, Alice, and Chris. Wayne is someone the Bardens work with, drink with, and felt blessed to be around.In fictionalized episodes ranging from Wayne's first love at sixteen to his deathbed conversion to Catholicism, this novel offers a surprisingly intimate vision of John Wayne. The Bardens are the perfect observers, guileless enough to retain an unabashed admiration for a man they consider a hero, perceptive enough to begin to see him as he really is--a man struggling to come to terms with the myths that define him.In their own way, the Bardens are coming to terms with these same myths. Frank Barden, trapped by alcoholism and the masculine ideal embodied by his friend Wayne, begins to lose touch with his family. Lillian Barden, disappointed by the impossible promise of the men around her, questions her faith in the manhood that men like Frank have to offer. As John Wayne lies on his deathbed at the close of this heartbreaking story, the Barden children have grown up, and Lillian and Frank are facing the dissolution of their marriage. With wit, intelligence and sympathy, Dan Barden \"manages at once to humanize John Wayne and to expose the mythmaking apparatus that is as vital to American family life as it is to American cultural life\" (Jennifer Egan).",

        "Description": "After more than twenty years of running Barefoot Contessa, the acclaimed specialty food store, Ina Garten published her first collection of recipes. The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook was an overnight sensation, but it's the kind of success that can only be grounded in years of experience. In it, Ina shared her ideas for familiar food but with outstanding flavor and -- most important of all -- recipes that really work.Now, with Barefoot Contessa Parties! Ina shares secrets she has gleaned from her years not only as a caterer but as a dedicated party giver. The keyword here is fun. Ina's parties are easy to prepare and fun for everyone, including the host. Forget those boring Saturday-night dinners that just won't end. With Ina's advice, you're certain to have all your friends saying, \"Wasn't that fun!\"Ina has packed Barefoot Contessa Parties! with plans for pulling off parties like a pro, stories about her own parties, and tips on assembling food (rather than cooking everything) and organizing like a caterer. In the spring you can invite your friends to a party where they all make their own pizzas. Come summer, it's into the garden for a lunch with grilled lamb and pita sandwiches that guests assemble themselves. In the autumn, when it's not Thanksgiving, Ina roasts a fresh turkey, which her friends enjoy with popovers and a creamy spinach gratin. And on a snowy winter's day, everyone is invited for a lunch buffet with seafood chowder and butternut squash and apple soup.Ever since Ina published her first book, people write, e-mail, and stop her on the street to say how much they love the food. She's reached new heights here with recipes like sour cream coffee cake--the ultimate breakfast treat. Salads? The red lettuce, balsamic onions, and blue cheese; Chinese chicken salad; and panzanella may be the best you've ever tasted. Filet of beef is easy to make for a fancy dinner with oh-so-good gorgonzola sauce, or sliced into sandwiches and served with lobster rolls for a Superbowl party. And fans of The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook will be delighted to find the recipe for the Lemon Cake they drooled over but only saw pictured, right here in this book.With so many great ideas and recipes in these pages for you to use, your friends will start to wonder why your parties are always so much fun.",

Now, at twenty-three, she's decided that it's time to find out: time to track down her biological parents. She knows only the barest facts about them: her mother was a California flower child; her father, an \"Asian national\" serving life in an Indian prison for murder. She knows that they were \"lousy people who'd considered me lousier still and who'd left me to be sniffed at by wild dogs, like a carcass in the mangy shade.\" Her only inheritance from them is a literally haunting past (\"white-hot sky and burnt-black leaves...star bursts of yearning\"), but now she wants revenge too.\"When you inherit nothing, you are entitled to everything,\" Debby says as she leaves home for San Francisco, where, if she can't find her mother, she suspects she can appropriate what she needs. Yet, once there, living the life of her newly named persona, Devi Dee (\"Tenderloin prowler, all allure and strength and zero innocence\"), she senses that she may have inherited more than she imagined: a legacy of shocking idea and impulse begins to reveal itself as Debby/Devi focuses her sights on the woman who may be her \"bio-mom,\" or just a dangerously unprepared proxy.",

        "Description": "Smallpox is the only infectious disease to have been eradicated, but the virus still exists in laboratories. Following a 1992 revelation that the Soviet Union had secretly developed smallpox into a military weapon, officials around the globe expressed concern that samples of the virus could fall into the hands of \"rogue\" states and terrorist organizations. Since vaccination stopped in 1980, most of the world is now susceptible to infection. Tucker (Monterey Institute of International Studies) provides a history of the horrific disease and analyzes urgent efforts by the US and other countries to strengthen their medical defenses against it.

This valuable book, and in particular its twenty ?presumptive norms? to govern how boards function, will certainly establish a new and important agenda for management and directors.\" ?Helene L. Kaplan Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom \"Dr. Bowen brings to Inside the Boardroom unusual qualifications: a distinguished economist who has served as university president, foundation executive, and [as a member of] several for-profit and nonprofit boards of directors. From this varied experience he combines scholarship with corporate reality in ways which provide wisdom, insight, and guidance as to how boards should work and how in fact they do work, and what they can and cannot contribute to management. Best of all, he does so in a thoroughly readable way.\" ?Nicholas Katzenbach, Partner Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland and Perretti Former United States Attorney General Former Senior Vice President and General Counsel, IBM Corporation \"This superb study rests on Bowen?s extensive experience of both corporate and nonprofit boards and his personal qualities of lucidity, perceptiveness, intellectual acuity, and fair-mindedness. Readable, fresh, jargon-free, and thoughtful, the book is a gem.\" ?Richard W. Lyman President Emeritus, The Rockefeller Foundation President Emeritus, Stanford University \"William Bowen is the finest example of America?s meritocracy. He rose, by ability and wisdom, from Main Street to the highest counsel of business and philanthropy while gaining along the way admiration for scholarly innovations as an economist and leadership as President of Princeton University.

Julie Barnhill says, \"Enough already!\" Unapologetically raucous, slightly irreverent, and refreshingly relevant, One Tough Mother exposes the mind-numbing, brain-draining, confidence-depleting minutia moms get stuck in. With humor and a sharp wit, Julie offers moms a dose of reality and a way to calm their fears about raising children. She encourages moms to straighten up, take back the control from their children, and stand firm on the nonnegotiables. With her help, any mom can become one tough mother.",

And it's not missing her oldfriends, who have developed an annoying fixation on boys. What really bothersDeVeaux is that being \"ruined\" has changed her dad into an ill-temperedjerk, and her mother just tiptoes around him.

        "Description": "From the boardroom to the locker room to the living room\u2014how winners become winners . . . and stay that way.Is success simply a matter of money and talent? Or is there another reason why some people and organizations always land on their feet, while others, equally talented, stumble again and again? There\u2019s a fundamental principle at work\u2014the vital but previously unexamined factor called confidence\u2014that permits unexpected people to achieve high levels of performance through routines that activate talent. Confidence explains:\u2022 Why the University of Connecticut women\u2019s basketball team continues its winning ways even though recent teams lack the talent of their predecessors\u2022 Why some companies are always positively perceived by employees, customers, Wall Street analysts, and the media while others are under a perpetual cloud\u2022 How a company like Gillette or a team like the Chicago Cubs ends a losing streak and breaks out of a circle of doom\u2022 The lessons a politician such as Nelson Mandela, who resisted the temptation to take revenge after being released from prison and assuming power, offers for leaders in both advanced democracies and trouble spots like the Middle East From the simplest ball games to the most complicated business and political situations, the common element in winning is a basic truth about people: They rise to the occasion when leaders help them gain the confidence to do it. Confidence is the new theory and practice of success, explaining why success and failure are not mere episodes but self-perpetuating trajectories. Rosabeth Moss Kanter shows why organizations of all types may be brimming with talent but not be winners, and provides people in leadership positions with a practical program for either maintaining a winning streak or turning around a downward spiral. Confidence is based on an extraordinary investigation of success and failure in companies such as Continental Airlines, Seagate, and Verizon and sports teams such as the University of North Carolina women\u2019s soccer team, New England Patriots, and Philadelphia Eagles, as well as schools, health care, and politics. Packed with brilliant, practical ideas such as \u201cpowerlessness corrupts\u201d and the \u201ctimidity of mediocrity,\u201d Confidence provides fresh thinking for perpetuating winning streaks and ending losing streaks in all facets of  life\u2014from the factors that can make or break corporations and governments to the keys for successful relationships in the workplace or at home.",

Starting as congressmen in the class of 1946, the two men developed a friendship and admiration for each other that would last for more than a decade. But what drove history, Matthews shows, was the enmity between these two towering figures whose 1960 presidential contest would set the nation's bitter course for years to come.In this startling dual portrait - a modern-day Amadeus, with Nixon as the talented, frustrated, always outdone Salieri to Kennedy's Mozart, the charismatic genius - Matthews shows how the early fondness between the two men (Kennedy told a trusted friend that if he didn't receive the Democratic nomination in 1960, he would vote for Nixon) degenerated into distrust and paranoia, the same emotions that, in the early 1970s, ravaged the nation.Christopher Matthews's revealing book sheds new light on this complicated relationship and the role that it played in shaping America's history.",
