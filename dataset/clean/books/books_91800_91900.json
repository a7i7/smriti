        "Description": "This incisive critique thoroughly and convincingly debunks the claims that recently discovered texts such as the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and even the Dead Sea Scrolls undermine the historical validity of the New Testament.Jenkins places the recent controversies surrounding the hidden gospels in a broad historical context and argues that, far from being revolutionary, such attempts to find an alternative Christianity date back at least to the Enlightenment. By employing the appropriate scholarly and historical methodologies, he demonstrates that the texts purported to represent pristine Christianity were in fact composed long after the canonical gospels found in the Bible. Produced by obscure heretical movements, these texts have attracted much media attention chiefly because they seem to support radical, feminist, and post-modern positions in the modern church. Indeed, Jenkins shows how best-selling books on the \"hidden gospels\" have been taken up by an uncritical, drama-hungry media as the basis for a social movement that could have powerful effects on the faith and practice of contemporary Christianity.",

He served as Jordan\u2019s first ambassador to Israel and was also ambassador to the United States, spokesperson at peace talks in Madrid and Washington, minister of foreign affairs, and deputy prime minister in charge of reform. Here he recounts the behind-the-scenes details of diplomatic ventures over the past two decades, including such recent undertakings as the Arab Peace Initiative and the Middle East Road Map.\u00a0Muasher\u2019s insights into internal Arab politics and the successes and failures of the Arab Center are uniquely informed and deeply felt. He assesses how the middle road approach to reform is faring and explains why current tactics used by the West to deal with Islamic groups are doomed to failure. He examines why the Arab Center has made so little progress and which Arab, Israeli, and American policies need rethinking. Part memoir and part analysis, this book reveals the human side of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is essential reading for all who share the hope that moderate, pragmatic Arab voices will be heard in today\u2019s vitriolic debates over how to achieve an enduring peace in the Middle East.",

        "Title": "Out of the Storm: The End of the Civil War, April-June 1865",
        "Authors": "By Trudeau, Noah Andre",
        "Description": "Out of the Storm is a moving and dramatic account of the final months of the American Civil War. In the spring of 1865, after four years of devastating conflict, the North and South had their final reckoning. For the men and women whose fierce determination to preserve their way of life had sustained the Confederacy, it was a time to confront the bitter truth that all was lost. For Abraham Lincoln, standing at the threshold of a long-awaited triumph, it was both a time to reconcile the cost of what had been won and a time to move forward, to rebuild the nation and heal its grievous wounds.Although most Civil War histories close with Lee's surrender at Appomattox, it took three more months to end this bloodiest of all American wars. These final months of struggle and change are explored in vivid detail in Out of the Storm. There are the final military campaigns of the war: Grant's pursuit of Lee; Sherman's death embrace with Johnston's army in North Carolina; and Wilson's relentless sweep through central Alabama and Georgia. There are compelling accounts of the tragic sinking of the steamboat Sultana (America's worst maritime disaster); the tremendous munitions explosion that leveled a large section of Mobile; the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the hunt for his killer; and the pursuit and capture of Jefferson Davis. Offering viewpoints of both North and South, Noah Andre Trudeau follows the domino-like collapse of the Confederacy, presenting poignant stories of individual courage and honor amid irrevocable chaos and change.This defining moment in the history of the United States has received surprisingly little study; it was a period of transition from a society at war with itself to a restored peace. Drawing upon an impressive body of personal reminiscences, memoirs, and previously unpublished material, Out of the Storm is a rich and memorable portrait of the last months of conflict.With this third volume, Trudeau completes his celebrated Civil War trilogy. Bloody Roads South, which won the prestigious Fletcher Pratt Award, recounted the fierce battle of Grant and Lee in Virginia in the spring of 1864. The Last Citadel was the first full-length treatment of the siege of Petersburg, Virginia. Now, Out of the Storm presents the final act of this profound epic in our history.",

        "Authors": "By Fallows, Deborah",
        "Description": "Deborah Fallows has spent much of her life learning languages and traveling around the world. But nothing prepared her for the surprises of learning Mandarin, China's most common language, or the intensity of living in Shanghai and Beijing. Over time, she realized that her struggles and triumphs in studying the language of her adopted home provided small clues to deciphering the behavior and habits of its people,and its culture's conundrums. As her skill with Mandarin increased, bits of the language\u2014a word, a phrase, an oddity of grammar\u2014became windows into understanding romance, humor, protocol, relationships, and the overflowing humanity of modern China.Fallows learned, for example, that the abrupt, blunt way of speaking that Chinese people sometimes use isn't rudeness, but is, in fact, a way to acknowledge and honor the closeness between two friends. She learned that English speakers' trouble with hearing or saying tones\u2014the variations in inflection that can change a word's meaning\u2014is matched by Chinese speakers' inability not to hear tones, or to even take a guess at understanding what might have been meant when foreigners misuse them.In sharing what she discovered about Mandarin, and how those discoveries helped her understand a culture that had at first seemed impenetrable, Deborah Fallows's Dreaming in Chinese opens up China to Westerners more completely, perhaps, than it has ever been before.",

        "Title": "Almayer's Folly (Dover Thrift Editions)",
        "Authors": "By Conrad, Joseph",
        "Description": "The tale of a man's inability to escape his self-delusion and the tragic results that ensue, Almayer's Folly unfolds with the lush prose and keen psychological insights for which its author is renowned. Set in nineteenth-century Borneo, the novel recounts the brief rise and protracted fall of Kaspar Almayer, a Dutch merchant who has struggled for 25 years to practice his trade in the jungle. Only his daughter, Nina, brightens Almayer's embittered marriage to a Malayan, and he dreams of their triumphant return to civilization \u2014 a fantasy undermined by Almayer's own greed and prejudice. This tale of personal tragedy offers a wider perspective on the disastrous effects of colonialism, a view familiar to the author from the worldly wealth of experience he acquired in fifteen years of service as a merchant seaman. Conrad infused his first novel with many of the themes and settings that he would return to again and again in his later fiction: the clash of Western and Eastern cultures, the sovereignty of the natural world, and the consequences of cowardice and racism. A gripping and thought-provoking chronicle, Almayer's Folly abounds in the page-turning excitement that won Conrad his place among the greatest storytellers in English literature.",

Many moth caterpillars produce silk thread inside their bodies, but the thread of the silkworm is so fine and strong that human beings use it to make a beautiful fabric. In countries like Japan, people raise millions of silkworms on farms and take their thread to be processed into silk cloth. Readers of this book will find out how silk farmers process silk and what role this amazing thread plays in the life cycle of the silkworm moth.",

        "Authors": "By Bailey, Liberty Hyde",
        "Description": "Did you know that the Jerusalem cherry does not grow in or near Jerusalem? That the Spanish cedar is a native of the West Indies? That the French mulberry is neither French nor a mulberry? L. H. Bailey, in this basic introduction to botanical nomenclature, reveals the confusion that results from misleading popular names of plants and points out the fun and the advantages of a sound scientific approach. In a few short chapters, he covers virtually every aspect of the subject of how plants get their names and what those names signify.After an opening chapter that discloses the surprising wealth of information that can be learned from a plant\u2019s botanical name, the author discusses the work of Carl Linnaeus (1707\u201378), the great Swedish naturalist who is \u201cthe father of botany.\u201d There is a brief history of the chaotic state of the science before it was effectively systematized, with outlines of pre-Linnaean classification schemes, followed by a full analysis of the Linnaean definitions of genus and species, the basis of modern binomial nomenclature. The following chapter, on plant identification, contains a discussion of herbariums and their value to the modern botanist, as well as valuable suggestions for amateur horticulturalists on preparing herbariums and packaging specimens to be mailed for identification purposes. Two successive chapters cover the many rules of nomenclature and focus upon some current problems in the field. Blackberries, potatoes, roses, and the amaryllis are analyzed as four illustrations of areas in which much work remains to be done.The final section of the book is certain to prove very useful to a variety of readers. The author defines scores of common Latin stems and word-endings used in botanical nomenclature and presents a few important rules of pronunciation. Most important of all, he includes a full, 20-page list of generic terms most likely to be met in horticultural literature and 42 pages of common Latin words and their English botanical applications and meanings.A rare combination of enthusiastic prose, well and clearly written, and scientific accuracy, this is an essential handbook for gardeners, amateur botanists, and horticulturalists as well as a superb introduction for beginning students to an important part of the botanical sciences.\u201cCarefully presented treatise.\u201d \u2014 America.\u201cWritten with knowledge and authority, charm and eloquence and poetic imagination on the varied aspects of the author\u2019s specialty.\u201d \u2014 New York Times.",
