        "Authors": "By Margolis, Simeon and Moses, Hamilton, M.D. (EDT)",
        "Description": "The Johns Hopkins Medical Handbook explains in great depth the 100 major medical disorders that most affect the lives of adult men and women. Cancer, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, atherosclerosis, and impotence are all carefully and thoroughly discussed in this comprehensive volume. The Handbook provides the background that you need to understand the effects of each of these, and other, disorders, then covers the diagnostics and treatments currently in use, adding the benefit of the most recent findings available.With clear, concise language to prepare you for consultations with your doctor, a clean, easy-to-read layout, some 70 beautifully rendered illustrations, and a comprehensive index, the Johns Hopkins Medical Handbook places the latest medical knowledge within easy reach.A unique Directory, also included in the Handbook, guides you as you seek treatment, information, and support. The Directory gives you the names, addresses, and phone numbers of America's teaching hospitals, health information organizations, government health agencies, and self-help groups. It also provides practical advice on how best to find an expert medical specialist; the hospital that is right for your needs; and the most reliable health information organizations and support groups. Hospital listings are even cross-referenced by disorder to make the right one for you easier to find.A powerful source of knowledge. And more powerful still when you consider that the Handbook combines the resources of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions with those of the nation's top health information organizations. The American Heart Association, the Arthritis Foundation, the American Diabetes Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Lung Association, and the National Cancer Institute are just a few of the organizations that have cooperated with Johns Hopkins in providing material for the Handbook.No medical reference is more authoritative or puts you in touch with so many resources.",

To walk the beat with Hammer, West, and Brazil is to learn the inner secrets of police work - the tension and the tedium, the hilarity and the heartbreak, the unexpected pump of adrenaline and the rush of courage that can lead to heroics ... or death.",

All of this information is from Lyn Peterson, an interior designer with 20 years of experience. Topics include: how to work with color; choosing furniture; using lighting to create atmosphere; developing a style that is not based on the latest fads; and accessorizing. Specific advice for special rooms, such as baths, kitchens, TV rooms, and computer rooms is also provided. Attractive, high-quality four-color photography and illustrations make it easy for readers to learn the basics of design and customize to suit their needs. Readers will repeatedly refer to this book, whether they need help designing an entire room from scratch or are just choosing the right color stain for their floors.",

        "Description": "Set in the apocalyptic atmosphere of 1900 - a time when many Americans were looking for signs foretelling the end of the world - Feather Crowns is the story of a young woman who unintentionally creates a national sensation. A firm wife living near the small town of Hopewell, Kentucky, Christianna Wheeler gives birth to the first recorded set of quintuplets in North America.Christie is suddenly thrown into a swirling storm of public attention. Thousands of strangers descend on her home, all wanting to see and touch the \"miracle babies.\" One visitor crawls right in through the window! The fate of the babies and the bizarre events that follow their births propel Christie and her husband far from home, on a journey that exposes them to the turbulent pageant of life at the beginning of the modern era.Richly detailed and poignant, Feather Crowns focuses on one woman but opens out ultimately into the chronicle of a time and a people. Written in Bobbie Ann Mason's taut yet lyrical prose, the novel ranges from a peaceful farming community to a fire-and-brimstone revival camp, from seamy traveling shows to the hushed precincts of the nation's capital. Moving through the center of it all is Christie, a charming, headstrong, loving woman who struggles heroically to come to terms with the extraordinary events of her long life.Feather Crowns is an American parable of profound resonance. Spellbindingly readable, it is a novel of classic stature destined to confirm Bobbie Ann Mason as one of America's most important writers.",

        "Description": "In this engrossing fifty-year journey chronicling the extraordinary adventures and observations of a legendary journalist for Time, Life and Fortune, Roy Rowan revisits powerful people who have helped shape the twentieth century. His riveting story begins with Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek during their brutal struggle for control of China - a conflict in which Rowan was deeply immersed - and ends with Ross Perot, the blunt-speaking billionaire who has become a force in American politics. Populating the pages between them are such historical personalities as General Douglas MacArthur, Marshal Tito, Jimmy Hoffa, Henry Luce, Imelda Marcos, Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan.During his career, Rowan looked for characteristics that separate the powerful from everyone else. His search took him to the wars in China, Korea and Vietnam, to civil rights riots, as well as to fierce battles in corporate America.Because the lives of these influential men and women still have currency, their stories raise a basic question relevant to us all. In today's world, with so much emphasis on human values, how are we to view the pursuit of power?",

It's V-J Day, the war's over, and Roscoe, after twenty-six years as chief braintruster of Albany's notorious political machine, decides to quit politics forever. But there's no exit, only new political wars, mysterious death, self-destructive party feuds, and scandalous threats to his beloved and her family.  Roscoe, the chivalrous warrior, turns his own life, and everybody else's, inside out to cope with the erupting disasters and finds fraudulence an extremely effective combat weapon. \"Righteousness doesn't stand a chance against the imagination,\" he concludes. Every step forward leads Roscoe back to the past-to the early loss of his true love, his own peculiar heroics in the First World War, the takeover of city hall, the fight with FDR and Al Smith to elect a governor, and the methodical assassination of gangster Jack (Legs) Diamond.  Roscoe, William Kennedy's seventh novel in his Albany cycle, illuminates the high and low of Albany life between the world wars. It is an odyssey of great scope and linguistic verve, a deadly comic masterpiece from one of America's most important novelists.  \"Kennedy's beguiling yarns are the kind of family myths embellished and retold across a kitchen table at night: whiskified, raunchy, darkly funny, tangles of old resentments and fresh exasperations.\" (Time )  \"When Kennedy writes about Albany, New York, he is in fact holding up a mirror to all of American history . . . his fictional terrain can be compared to the Faulknerian South in its complex richness.\" (The Washington Post)  \"Kennedy's power is such that the reader will follow him almost anywhere, to the edge of tragedy and back again to redemption.\" (The Wall Street Journal)",

Now at the pinnacle of his career, serving as president of the United States, Lee is faced with a most unusual task - that of marshaling federal law enforcement agencies to catch an assassin who is picking off some of the nation's high-level politicos. When a prominent conservative politician with a shady reputation is expertly killed at his lakeside cabin, authorities can come up with no suspects and even less hard evidence. But then, within days, two other, seemingly isolated deaths - achieved by very different means - are feared linked to the same ruthless murderer.With the help of his CIA director wife, Kate Rule Lee, Will trails the most clever and professional of killers before he can strike again. From a quiet D.C. suburb to the corridors of power to a deserted island hideaway, Will, Kate, and maverick FBI agent Robert Kinney track their man and set a trap with extreme caution and care - and await the most dangerous kind of quarry, a killer with a cause to die for.",

On the surface they appear to be so\u2014especially the period to which this term is most often applied, the years from the end of the Civil War to the early 1900\u2019s. This period of history has receded into a benevolent haze, leaving us with the image of an ebullient, carefree America, the fun and charm of the Gilded Age, the Gay Nineties. But this gaiety was only a brittle veneer that covered widespread turmoil and suffering. The good old days were good for but the privileged few. For the farmer, the laborer, the average breadwinner, life was an unremitting hardship. This segment of the populace was exploited or lived in the shadow of total neglect. And youth had no voice. These are the people, the mass of Americans, whose adversities this book attempts to chronicle.",

From Alan Hollinghurst, the acclaimed author of The Sparsholt Affair, The Line of Beauty is a sweeping novel about class, sex, and money during four extraordinary years of change and tragedy.In the summer of 1983, twenty-year-old Nick Guest moves into an attic room in the Notting Hill home of the Feddens: conservative Member of Parliament Gerald, his wealthy wife Rachel, and their two children, Toby\u2014whom Nick had idolized at Oxford\u2014and Catherine, who is highly critical of her family's assumptions and ambitions. As the boom years of the eighties unfold, Nick, an innocent in the world of politics and money, finds his life altered by the rising fortunes of this glamorous family. His two vividly contrasting love affairs, one with a young black clerk and one with a Lebanese millionaire, dramatize the dangers and rewards of his own private pursuit of beauty, a pursuit as compelling to Nick as the desire for power and riches among his friends. Richly textured, emotionally charged, disarmingly comic, this is a major work by one of our finest writers.",

The first clue, an anonymous diary, includes not only indecipherable handwriting, but puzzling technical drawings and chemical formulas as well. Who dropped the diary near the burning house? Was it the gaunt stranger Nancy glimpsed running away from the flaming structure? What was he doing there? And does he know the whereabouts of Felix Raybolt, an unscrupulous dealer in patents, who has not been seen since his home burned? Or did Raybolt die in the fire? When evidence mounts against Joe Swenson, who was swindled by \"Foxy Felix\", our young detective makes the desperate effort to exonerate the inventor of the suspicion of arson because of his dear five-year-old daughter.",

With blistering wit and passion, Goldberg offers a twelve-step program to help journalists overcome their addiction to slanted news and exposes the main culprits of arrogance in the media. He reveals: How the media's coverage of the Jayson Blair scandal missed far more serious problems at the New York Times Why the media refuse to shoot straight when the subject turns to guns Which CBS News icon is \"transparently liberal,\" according to commentator Andy Rooney Why some think the top journalism school in America is an intellectual gulag How some journalists, like Bob Costas and Tim Russert, do get it-and how they think American journalism can be made better.",

        "Description": "In The Threatening Storm, Kenneth M. Pollack, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Iraq, provides a masterly insider\u2019s perspective on the crucial issues facing the United States as it moves toward a new confrontation with Saddam Hussein.For the past fifteen years, as an analyst on Iraq for the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council, Kenneth Pollack has studied Saddam as closely as anyone else in the United States. In 1990, he was one of only three CIA analysts to predict the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. As the principal author of the CIA\u2019s history of Iraqi military strategy and operations during the Gulf War, Pollack gained rare insight into the methods and workings of what he believes to be the most brutal regime since Stalinist Russia.Examining all sides of the debate and bringing a keen eye to the military and geopolitical forces at work, Pollack ultimately comes to this controversial conclusion: through our own mistakes, the perfidy of others, and Saddam\u2019s cunning, the United States is left with few good policy options regarding Iraq. Increasingly, the option that makes the most sense is for the United States to launch a full-scale invasion, eradicate Saddam\u2019s weapons of mass destruction, and rebuild Iraq as a prosperous and stable society\u2014for the good of the United States, the Iraqi people, and the entire region.Pollack believed for many years that the United States could prevent Saddam from threatening the stability of the Persian Gulf and the world through containment\u2014a combination of sanctions and limited military operations. Here, Pollack explains why containment is no longer effective, and why other policies intended to deter Saddam ultimately pose a greater risk than confronting him now, before he gains possession of nuclear weapons and returns to his stated goal of dominating the Gulf region. \u201cIt is often said that war should be employed only in the last resort,\u201d Pollack writes. \u201cI reluctantly believe that in the case of the threat from Iraq, we have come to the last resort.\u201dOffering a view of the region that has the authority and force of an intelligence report, Pollack outlines what the leaders of neighboring Arab countries are thinking, what is necessary to gain their support for an invasion, how a successful U.S. operation would be mounted, what the likely costs would be, and how Saddam might react. He examines the state of Iraq today\u2014its economy, its armed forces, its political system, the status of its weapons of mass destruction as best we understand them, and the terrifying security apparatus that keeps Saddam in power. Pollack also analyzes the last twenty years of relations between the United States and Iraq to explain how the two countries reached the unhappy standoff that currently prevails.Commanding in its insights and full of detailed information about how leaders on both sides will make their decisions, The Threatening Storm is an essential guide to understanding what may be the crucial foreign policy challenge of our time.",

        "Description": "\"If you make yourself a sheep, the wolves will eat you.\" -Benjamin FranklinIn a galvanizing call to arms in the wake of the presidential election, an all-star line-up of leading progressive voices and cultural figures has joined together in a Melville House \"instant book\" urging opponents of the right not to give in to despair and to launch an immediate counterattack. The project is the result of a round-the-clock effort that saw Howard Dean, Donna Brazile, Greg Palast, Lewis Lapham, Nicholas Kristof and others working through the Thanksgiving holiday to write a series of passionate manifestos outlining a variety of new ideas for life in a post-11/2 world. The result is a powerful collection that also features economists environmentalists, media critics, feminists, anti-war activists, novelists, poets and satirists writing about what to do in their key areas of expertise. \"Our feeling was someone had to do something immediately,\" explains publisher Dennis Loy Johnson, who edited the book along with co-publisher Valerie Merians. \"The marvelous energy that had gone into the election was turning into despair, which was only making the rise of the right all the more emphatic.\" The quality of the contributions is remarkable, adds Merians. \"This is no normal 'insta-book,'\" she says. \"The essays are extremely well written and thought out. We've organized them into a coherent game plan. We've even got an appendix of contact info.\" \"The best part is the heat,\" says Johnson. \"It's really inspiring stuff. People were whooping down the phone line when we called them with the idea. They dropped everything to write all night.\" WHAT WE DO NOW from Melville House includes: \u00b7 Howard Dean, Donna Brazile, and Greg Palast on voting reform ... \u00b7 Lewis Lapham and Nicholas Kristof on how to re-organize the Democratic Party ... \u00b7 Harper's Magazine publisher John R. MacArthur on supporting labor by fighting free trade \u00b7 Tax attorney Maud Newton (famous, by the way, for her literary website) on tax reform... \u00b7 Biologist Sandra Steingraber on renewing the fight for the environment... \u00b7 Martha Nussbaum on improving international relations... \u00b7 Cass Sunstein and Jamin Raskin on court reform... \u00b7 Columbia history professor Eric Foner on keeping a historical perspective ... \u00b7 Feminist Robin Morgan and Esther Kaplan on countering the rise of fundamentalism in our schools and courts ... \u00b7 Danny Schechter and feminst Jennifer Pozner on media reform... \u00b7 Earl Ofari Hutchinson on winning back the black fundamentalist vote... \u00b7 Leslie Cagan, who organized the giant 500,000 person demonstration during the RNC in August, and Medea Benjamin, who disrupted President Bush's RNC speech, on what activists can do now... \u00b7 Fiction writers Percival Everett, George Saunders, and Steve Almond, and poet Alicia Ostriker, on the cultural implications, and how to respond... \u00b7 Billionaires for Bush on how really rich people can work to keep their money... \u00b7 and more. . .",
