        "Title": "Practical C++ Programming (Nutshell Handbooks)",
        "Authors": "By Oualline, Steve",
        "Description": "Fast becoming the standard language of commercial software development, C++ is an update of the C programming language, adding object-oriented features that are very helpful for today's larger graphical applications.Practical C++ Programming is a complete introduction to the C++  language for the beginning programmer, and also for C programmers  transitioning to C++.  Unlike most other C++ books, this book emphasizes  a practical, real-world approach, including how to debug, how to make your  code understandable to others, and how to understand other people's code.Almost as important, this book is written in the readable style that has  made Nutshell Handbooks\u00ae famous.Topics covered include:Good programming styleC++ syntax, what to use and what not to useC++ class designDebugging and optimizationAt the end of each chapter are a number of exercises you can use to make  sure you've grasped the concepts.  Solutions to most are provided.Practical C++ Programming describes standard C++ features that are supported by all UNIX C++ compilers (including gcc) and DOS/Windows  and NT compilers (including Microsoft Visual C++).Comparison: Practical C++ Programming vs. C++: The Core  LanguageO'Reilly's policy is not to publish two books on the same topic for the same audience.  We'd rather spend twice the time on making one book the industry's best.  So why do we have two C++ tutorials?  Which one should you get?The answer is they're very different.  Steve Oualline, author of the  successful book Practical C Programming, came to us with the idea  of doing a C++ edition.  Thus was born Practical C++ Programming.   It's a comprehensive tutorial to C++, starting from the ground up.  It also  covers the programming process, style, and other important real-world issues.   By providing exercises and problems with answers, the book helps you make  sure you understand before you move on.While that book was under development, we received the proposal forC++: The Core Language.  Its innovative approach is to cover only a subset of the language -- the part that's most important to learn first -- and to assume readers already know C.  The idea is that C++ is just too complicated to learn all at once.  Instead, you learn the basics solidly  from this short book, which prepares you to start programming and to  understand some of the other C++ books you'll need for reference.These two books are based on different philosophies and are for different  audiences.  But there is one way in which they work together.  If you are  a C programmer, we recommend you start with C++: The Core Language,  then read about advanced topics and real-world problems in Practical C++  Programming.",

        "Description": "With this stunning novel about a woman and a marriage that begins in passion and becomes violent, the Pulitzer Prize--winning journalist and bestselling author of One True Thing and Object Lessons moves to a new dimension as a writer of superb fiction. \"If literature were judged solely by its ability to elicit strong emotions,\" Kirkus Reviews said about One True Thing, \"columnist-cum-novelist Quindlen would win another Pulitzer.\"\u00a0\u00a0And the same will be said about Black and Blue, a brilliant novel of suspense, substance, and importance.In Black and Blue, Fran Benedetto tells a spellbinding story: how at nineteen she fell in love with Bobby Benedetto, how their passionate marriage became a nightmare, why she stayed, and what happened on the night she finally decided to run away with her ten-year-old son and start a new life under a new name. Living in fear in Florida--yet with increasing confidence, freedom, and hope--Fran unravels the complex threads of family, identity, and desire that shape a woman's life, even as she begins to create a new one. As Fran starts to heal from the pain of the past, she almost believes she has escaped it--that Bobby Benedetto will not find her and again provoke the complex combustion between them of attraction and destruction, lust and love.Black and Blue is a beautifully written, heart-stopping story in which Anna Quindlen writes with power, wisdom, and humor about the real lives of men and women, the varieties of people and love, the bonds between mother and child, the solace of family and friendship, the inexplicable feelings between people who are passionately connected in ways they don't understand. It is a remarkable work of fiction by the writer whom Alice Hoffman has called \"a national treasure.\"",

By bringing the internal systems into balance, the Schwarzbein program has been proven to: reverse type II diabetes; free people from food cravings for chocolate, caffeine and sugar; cure depression and mood swings; and reduce body fat while building lean tissue. The nutritional program consists of two phases \u2014Healing and Maintenance \u2014 which are easy to adopt into any lifestyle.

        "Description": "This volume, the fifth collection of George F. Will's essays on America's political tumults and cultural controversies, makes clear that he deserves to be ranked in the American tradition of high journalism, a tradition that extends back through Walter Lippmann and H. L. Mencken to Edwin Lawrence Godkin.With wit, erudition, and craftsmanship that readers of 480 newspapers and Newsweek have enjoyed for twenty years, Will assesses the triumphs, misadventures, and foibles of the past four years. During this period George Bush's presidency, filled with \"verbal fender-benders\" and policy disappointments, paved the way for the ebullient Bill Clinton, that enthusiast of government of whom Will says, \"American government is failing at such fundamental tasks as providing streets free of gunfire and schools with high standards, and yet at this moment, when government's reputation is deservedly rotten, Clinton says that it is competent to plan the future.\"Many of the institutions that should sustain our fraying society, says Will, have been populated by men and women like the Clintons who came of age in the 1960s, a decade that gave legitimacy to a \"perverse premise - that the social order is an infringement on freedom rather than freedom's foundation.\"\"The idea is abroad,\" writes Will, \"that there is no moral heritage worth 'imposing' on children, respect for whom requires that their 'values' be regarded as a matter of taste.\" We are, Will observes, increasingly unable to talk about race, or equality, or art, or literature without using these subjects as \"a mere index of who has power and whom the powerful victimize.\"Of today's confused political goals and public ideals, Will says, \"The age that pushes hard against [us] is not something that has just befallen us. We made it; are making it. Much of it comes from the top down, a trickle-down culture that begins with the idea that the good life consists of satisfying every impulse. Many intellectuals have helped supplant the moral categories essential to civilized living, replacing them with a thin-gruel vocabulary of 'lifestyles' and 'values' and 'self-esteem.'\"In this moment of diminished vision and cloudy moral precepts, \"society's forces for order are no match for today's popular culture.\" Will reminds us, through vivid portraits of Americans striving hard to knit the social fabric back together, and through his witty, memorable stories of watching his own children grow, that we disregard society's seamlessness at our peril. His hopeful conclusion is that the human decency that abounds in America is our primary bulwark against \"the accelerating failure to (in the Constitution's words) insure domestic tranquility.\"",

But this announcement marks the start of an operation that will test all her hard-won knowledge and experience\u2013and her intelligence and courage\u2013as nothing has before. Having analyzed information from her agents, she realizes that there is indeed an imminent terrorist threat. She may even have the invisible\u2019s point of entry. But what she cannot draw out of all the \u201cchatter\u201d is the invisible\u2019s identity and intended target. With each passing hour, the danger increases. As the desperate hunt continues, it becomes clear that Liz\u2019s intuitive skills, her ability to get deep inside her enemy\u2019s head, are her best hope for tracking down the terrorist. But will that be enough? And can she succeed in time to avert a disaster?Drawing from her experience as the first woman director general of MI5, Stella Rimington gives us a story that is smart, tautly drawn, and suspenseful from first to last. At Risk is a stunning debut novel that plunges us headlong into today\u2019s shadowy and fever-pitched battle between terrorism and Intelligence.",

        "Authors": "By Deaver, Jeffery",
        "Description": "In the most ingenious and provocative thriller yet from the acclaimed New York Times bestselling author Jeffery Deaver, a conscience-plagued mobster turned government hitman struggles to find his moral compass amid rampant treachery and betrayal in 1936 Berlin.  Paul Schumann, a German American living in New York City in 1936, is a mobster hitman known as much for his brilliant tactics as for taking only \"righteous\" assignments. But then Paul gets caught. And the arresting officer offers him a stark choice: prison or covert government service. Paul is asked to pose as a journalist covering the summer Olympics taking place in Berlin. He's to hunt down and kill Reinhard Ernst -- the ruthless architect of Hitler's clandestine  rearmament. If successful, Paul will be pardoned and given the financial means to go legit; if he refuses the job, his fate will be Sing Sing and the electric chair.  Paul travels to Germany, takes a room in a boardinghouse near the Tiergarten -- the huge park in central Berlin but also, literally, the \"Garden of Beasts\" -- and begins his hunt. In classic Deaver fashion, the next forty-eight hours are a feverish cat-and-mouse chase, as Paul stalks Ernst through Berlin while a dogged Berlin police officer and the entire Third Reich apparatus search frantically for the American.  Garden of Beasts is packed with fascinating period detail and features a cast of perfectly realized locals, Olympic athletes and senior Nazi officials -- some real, some fictional. With hairpin plot twists, the reigning \"master of ticking-bomb suspense\" (People) plumbs the nerve-jangling paranoia of prewar Berlin and steers the story to a breathtaking and wholly unpredictable ending.",

        "Description": "In The Leadership Engine, Noel Tichy showed how great companies strive to create leaders at all levels of the organization, and how those leaders actively develop future generations of leaders.  In this new book, he takes the theme further, showing how great companies and their leaders develop their business knowledge into \u2ce5achable points of view,\u27f3pend a great portion of their time giving their learnings to others, sharing best practices, and how they in turn learn and receive business ideas/knowledge from the employees they are teaching. Calling this exchange a virtuous teaching cycle, Professor Tichy shows how business builders from Jack Welch at GE to Joe Liemandt at Trilogy create organizations that foster this knowledge exchange and how their efforts result in smarter, more agile companies, and winning results. Some of these ideas were showcased in Tichy\u2032s recent Harvard Business Review article entitled, \u236f Ordinary Boot Camp.\" Using examples from GE, Ford, Dell, Southwest Airlines and many others, Tichy presents and analyzes these principles in action and shows how managers can begin to transform their own businesses into teaching organizations and, consequently, better-performing companies",

        "Description": "The twenty-first century economy is fluid, technology-driven, based on creativity and relationships. Yet most businesses and organizations are still structured like nineteenth-century factories, forcing workers into cookie cutter roles. The model Sally Helgesen puts forth in The Web of Inclusion represents a fully realized vision of the information-age organization: the web of inclusion. A web is natural, organic, not modeled on a machine. Like a spider's web, a web of inclusion is both a structure and an ever-evolving process, constantly changing to meet the demands of the business environment.Building a web of inclusion means that ideas come from all employees, not just from the top down; that what individuals do in the workplace depends on their talents, not on their titles; that a premium is placed on flexibility; that the edges of the web of inclusion connect with people outside the organization: customers, suppliers, joint-venture partners, the mass media.Helgesen lays out the theory behind her provocative vision of a new style of management, then profiles five organizations that have achieved extraordinary success by adopting webs of inclusion: the hi-tech Intel in Silicon Valley; the Miami Herald, a traditional media company; Beth Israel Hospital in Boston; Nickelodeon in New York; and Anixter Inc., a cable and wire vendor based in Chicago. Each profile vividly demonstrates a different advantage of the web of inclusion.",

        "Description": "President Bill Clinton's year of crisis, which began when his affair with Monica Lewinsky hit the front pages in January 1998, engendered a host of important questions of criminal and constitutional law, public and private morality, and political and cultural conflict. In a book written while the events of the year were unfolding, Richard Posner presents a balanced and scholarly understanding of the crisis that also has the freshness and immediacy of journalism. Posner clarifies the issues and eliminates misunderstandings concerning facts and the law that were relevant to the investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and to the impeachment proceeding itself. He explains the legal definitions of obstruction of justice and perjury, which even many lawyers are unfamiliar with. He carefully assesses the conduct of Starr and his prosecutors, including their contacts with the lawyers for Paula Jones and their hardball tactics with Monica Lewinsky and her mother. He compares and contrasts the Clinton affair with Watergate, Iran-Contra, and the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, exploring the subtle relationship between public and private morality. And he examines the place of impeachment in the American constitutional scheme, the pros and cons of impeaching President Clinton, and the major procedural issues raised by both the impeachment in the House and the trial in the Senate. This book, reflecting the breadth of Posner's experience and expertise, will be the essential foundation for anyone who wants to understand President Clinton's impeachment ordeal.",

Ambrose, comes the definitive telling of the war in Europe, from D-Day, June 6, 1944, to the end, eleven months later, on May 7, 1945.This authoritative narrative account is drawn by the author himself from his five acclaimed books about that conflict, most particularly from the definitive and comprehensive D-Day and Citizen Soldiers, about which the great Civil War historian James McPherson wrote, \u201cIf there is a better book about the experience of GIs who fought in Europe during World War II, I have not read it. Citizen Soldiers captures the fear and exhilaration of combat, the hunger and cold and filth of the foxholes, the small intense world of the individual rifleman as well as the big picture of the European theater in a manner that grips the reader and will not let him go. No one who has not been there can understand what combat is like but Stephen Ambrose brings us closer to an understanding than any other historian has done.\u201d The Victors also includes stories of individual battles, raids, acts of courage and suffering from Pegasus Bridge, an account of the first engagement of D-Day, when a detachment of British airborne troops stormed the German defense forces and paved the way for the Allied invasion; and from Band of Brothers, an account of an American rifle company from the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment who fought, died, and conquered, from Utah Beach through the Bulge and on to Hitter's Eagle\u2019s Nest in Germany. Stephen Ambrose is also the author of Eisenhower, the greatest work on Dwight Eisenhower, and one of the editors of the Supreme Allied Commander's papers. He describes the momentous decisions about how and where the war was fought, and about the strategies and conduct of the generals and officers who led the invasion and the bloody drive across Europe to Berlin. But, as always with Stephen E. Ambrose, it is the ranks, the ordinary boys and men, who command his attention and his awe. The Victors tells their stories, how citizens became soldiers in the best army in the world. Ambrose draws on thousands of interviews and oral histories from government and private archives, from the high command\u2014Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton\u2014on down through officers and enlisted men, to re-create the last year of the Second World War when the Allied soldiers pushed the Germans out of France, chased them across Germany, and destroyed the Nazi regime.",
