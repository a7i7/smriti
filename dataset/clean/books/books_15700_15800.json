Tennessee Williams, author of such indelible masterpieces as The Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named Desire, is considered by many to be the greatest literary artist of the American theater. Tom is Lyle Leverich's definitive account based on his exclusive access to letters, diaries, unpublished manuscripts, and family documents of Williams's early life and of the events that shaped this most autobiographical of dramatists. It tells the story of the marital traumas of his bullying father and overly protective mother, the mental disorders that institutionalized his beloved sister Rose, his stalled academic career, and his confused sexuality and early successes as a writer; and it leaves Thomas Lanier Williams on the brink of fame with The Glass Menagerie and his transformation into the celebrated persona of \"Tennessee.\"",

        "Description": "\"Should I take my umbrella?\" \"Should I buy insurance?\" \"Which horse should I bet on?\" Every day \u2015 in business, in love affairs, in forecasting the weather or the stock market questions arise which cannot be answered by a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" Many of these questions involve probability. Probabilistic thinking is as crucially important in ordinary affairs as it is in the most abstruse realms of science. This book is the best nontechnical introduction to probability ever written. Its author, the late Dr. Warren Weaver, was a professor of mathematics, active in the Rockefeller and Sloan foundations , an authority on communications and probability, and distinguished for his work at bridging the gap between science and the average citizen. In accessible language and drawing upon the widely diverse writings of thinkers like Kurt Godel, Susanne K.Langer, and Nicholas Bernoulli, Dr. Weaver explains such concepts as permutations, independent events, mathematical expectation, the law of averages, Chebychev's theorem, the law of large numbers, and probability distributions. He uses a probabilistic viewpoint to illuminate such matters as rare events and coincidences, and also devotes space to the relations of probability and statistics, gambling, and modern scientific research. Dr. Weaver writes with wit, charm and exceptional clarity. His mathematics is elementary, grasp of the subject profound, and examples fascinating. They are complemented by 49 delightful drawings by Peg Hosford. 13 tables. 49 drawings. Foreword. Index.",

Bush\u2019s original choice for Secretary of Labor and a former union official, is one of the foremost authorities on America\u2019s labor unions. Now, in the explosive new book Betrayal, she and fellow union expert Daniel Gray expose the corrupt bargain between the labor movement and the Democratic Party.Committed to a far-left political agenda\u2014and to enhancing their own power\u2014union bosses funnel at least half a billion dollars into Democratic coffers every year. And they do it, illegally, by using dues money that workers are forced to pay as a condition of their employment\u2014dues money that each year brings the unions $17 billion, all of it tax-free. What do labor bosses get in return? The power to call the shots in Democratic campaigns and on party policy, extraordinary influence at all levels of government, billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded federal grants, and special legal privileges that leave them free to act as they please, no matter the consequences for the American people. The cycle of corruption is seemingly endless.Chavez and Gray name names, exposing the many politicians who are in Big Labor\u2019s pocket\u2014including the leading lights of the Democratic Party. Betrayal also reveals: \u2022 Big Labor\u2019s all-out efforts in the 2004 election, including how just one local union has launched a $35-million campaign to unseat President Bush\u2022 How corrupt union officials use members\u2019 hard-earned money to fund lavish lifestyles\u2014and how their Democratic supporters let them get away with it \u2022 How unions flout the law by failing to report any of their political spending to the IRS\u2022 How a government report uncovered the Democrats\u2019 sellout to Big Labor\u2014but how the unions and the Democrats sued to keep the report from going public \u2022 How the U.S. government lets unions practice legalized terrorism against American citizens\u2022 How public-employee unions extort concessions from the government and put Americans at risk by refusing to provide vital services like policing and firefighting\u2022 How Americans now live under a system of legal apartheid\u2014one set of rules for labor bosses, another for the rest of usAll of us foot the bill for this corrupt system.

And as the hot, dry countryside unfolded slowly before them, the couple looked back with relief -- and wonder -- at the tense, frenzied corporate life they had left behind.The story of a walk, a marriage, an adventure, and a dream made real, A WALK ACROSS FRANCE marks the debut of an enormously entertaining writer.",

        "Authors": "By Johnson, James Weldon",
        "Description": "One of the most prominent African-Americans of his time, James Weldon Johnson (1871\u20131938) was a successful lawyer, educator, social reformer, songwriter, and critic. But it was as a poet and novelist that he achieved lasting fame. Among his most famous works, The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man in many ways parallels Johnson's own remarkable life. First published in 1912, the novel relates, through an anonymous narrator, events in the life of an American of mixed ethnicity whose exceptional abilities and ambiguous appearance allow him unusual social mobility \u2014 from the rural South to the urban North and eventually to Europe. A radical departure from earlier books by black authors, this pioneering work not only probes the psychological aspects of \"passing for white\" but also examines the American caste and class system. The human drama is powerful and revealing \u2014 from the narrator's persistent battles with personal demons to his firsthand observations of a Southern lynching and the mingling of races in New York's bohemian atmosphere at the turn of the century. Revolutionary for its time, the Autobiography remains both an unrivaled example of black expression and a major contribution to American literature.",

        "Description": "Even if you have lost 40, 50, or even 80 percent of your savings, it is still possible to retire in comfort.  This year's stock market collapse has been especially devastating to millions of Americans in their forties and fifties who had been buying stocks and mutual funds for their retirement years. Trillions of dollars were lost, and thousands of retirement accounts and portfolios were reduced by more than 50 percent. The question now is, what's the next step? Will these hardworking people need to continue working into their seventies? Not if they make the right moves today, says Jonathan Clements, The Wall Street Journal's highly respected personal finance columnist.  Today, investors are faced with a barrage of dubious advice. Stocks are supposedly dead. Bonds are now touted as the only safe way to invest. Meanwhile, folks are once again claiming you can't go wrong with real estate. Clements, an award-winning personal finance columnist, rips apart this dubious advice, telling readers what's true and what's not. In the same feisty, easy-to-understand style that he brings to his regular Wall Street Journal columns, Clements gives readers a road map for the years ahead. He takes them step-by-step through the process of rebuilding their nest eggs and explains how, after reaching retirement, they can squeeze the maximum out of their savings.  This practical, concise guide will allow all readers to stop panicking, rebuild assets, and get their retirement plans back on track.",

        "Description": "In the hugely popular New York Times bestseller, Dogs Never Lie About Love, provocative psychoanalyst Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson brilliantly navigated the inner landscape of \u201cman\u2019s best friend.\u201d Now he delves deep into the secretive, playful world of cats, revealing emotions, debunking myths, and honoring the feline\u2019s evolution from solitary jungle creature to human companion. Drawing from literature, history, animal behavioral research, and the wonderful true stories of cat experts and cat lovers around the world, Jeffrey Masson vividly explores the delights and mysteries of the feline heart. But at the core of this remarkable book are Masson\u2019s candid, often amusing observations of his own five cats. Their mischievousness, aloofness, and affection provide a way to examine emotions from contentment to jealousy, from anger to love. Consider the question: Are cats selfish? While human egocentricity is defined by how little a person cares about others, the cat\u2019s narcissism is not like that at all. Cats may appear self-centered, but they watch us all the time, taking us in. They see us; they notice us\u2013a far cry from vanity.Cats are curious, a trait that rarely kills them. On the contrary, it gives them the chance to assess, in their own idiosyncratic way, whether we are worthy of their attention. Cats are happy to be themselves. What they think of us is a different question entirely. \u201cWe need cats to need us,\u201d notes Masson, \u201cIt unnerves us that they do not. However, if they do not need us, they nonetheless seem to love us.\u201dThe Nine Emotional Lives of Cats will captivate readers with its surprises and insights, offering a new perspective on the deep connection shared by humans and their feline friends. This is the book that Masson\u2019s many fans and cat lovers everywhere have been waiting for.",

        "Title": "The Air Force Integrates, 1945-1964, Second Edition (Smithsonian History of Aviation Series)",
        "Authors": "By Gropman, Alan L.",
        "Description": "On April 5, 1945, more than sixty black officers of the U.S. Army Air Forces were arrested for entering a whites-only club at Freeman Field, Indiana, to protest the rigid segregation and unequal policies under which they and all African American airmen were forced to serve. Termed a mutiny by the white commanders at the base, the incident was one of several racial conflicts during the next four years that helped convince senior officers in the newly independent Air Force that segregation was an inefficient personnel policy. Documenting the racial integration of the Air Force from the end of World War II to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Alan L. Gropman contends that the service desegregated itself not for moral or political reasons but to improve military effectiveness. He draws on a range of unpublished records to show that, while proceeding smoothly, Air Force integration initially did little to ensure fair promotion practices or to protect African Americans from off-post discrimination, especially in housing, entertainment, and education. Gropman also outlines the political motivations of President Truman's 1948 Executive Order 9981 for equal opportunity in the military and reviews controversial Kennedy administration initiatives that attempted to place the military at the forefront of civil rights reform. First published in 1977, the book now includes a new preface charting the policy changes that have dramatically increased the numbers of black officers and senior supervisors in the Air Force during the past two decades. Detailing the uneven progress of a major shift in military policy, The Air Force Integrates also illuminates the often pragmatic motivations of those who bring about fundamental social change.",

        "Description": "Michael Hamilton Morgan writes on the PT 109 collision: It?s about 2 a.m., August 2, 1943. Lt. John F. Kennedy squints into the fog and black while at the wheel of PT 109, idling in the Blackett Strait off Gizo in the Solomon Islands. His orders are to attack the ?Tokyo Express? resupplying Japanese installations.... He and his young crew are ready, but handicapped by darkness and fog.... Suddenly, only 300 yards away, a black shape looms...traveling without lights and at high speed. Only seconds before impact...the ship is identified as a Japanese destroyer, the Amagiri. The much larger craft slices through the hull of PT 109, cutting the 80-foot wooden-hulled boat in two. Several of the crew are injured, one critically. The crew takes refuge on the larger section that remains afloat until dawn. Then all are into the water, and Lt. Kennedy begins the series of epic swims that will save his crew and earn him a place in history. Forty years after his death and 60 years after his first collision with history in the South Pacific, John F. Kennedy and his story still inspire readers. In Collision with History, JFK?s heroic efforts to save the 11-man crew of PT 109 are brought to vivid life, interwoven with a comprehensive history of PT boats and the World War II campaign in the Solomon Islands. Combining renowned explorer Robert Ballard?s account of his search for the wreckage of PT 109 with survivor accounts and Kennedy family members? personal recollections, this companion volume to the major National Geographic television event is a moving introduction to the young war hero who would later become president.",

        "Authors": "By McLanahan, Sara S. (EDT), Garfinkel, Irwin (EDT), and Hochschild, Jennifer L. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Successful social policies for children are critical to America's future. Yet the status of children in America suggests that the nation's policies may not be serving them well. Infant and child mortality rates in the U.S. remain high compared to other western industrialized nations; child poverty rates have worsened in the past decade; poor health care, child abuse, and inadequate schooling and child care persist.This book presents a new set of social policies designed to alleviate these problems and to help satisfy the needs of all children. The policies deal with the seven critical domains affecting children from birth through the passage to adulthood: child care, schooling, transition to work, health care, income security, physical security, and child abuse.While nearly everyone agrees that children are in trouble, there is considerable debate over what kind of trouble they are in, why this is so, and whether government can or should more actively seek to solve these problems. Americans are evenly divided on the question of whether children's problems are more economic or moral in origin. The seven proposals in this volume both reflect and cut across ideological disagreements. Some call for more government, others call for less, and all call for different government methods for achieving socially agreed upon goals.Recommendations include: replacing major welfare programs and tax subsidies with a set of universal policies, including national health insurance, child support assurance, and universal child care; offering publicly funded vouchers to allow poor children in inner-city neighborhoods to choose their own schools; using both private and governmental resources to get tough on crime through more stringent criminal justice policies and dramatic social measures; and expanding apprenticeship programs for non-college bound youths.In addition to the editors, the contributors are Barbara R. Bergmann and Robert I. Lerman, American University; Douglas J. Besharov, American Enterprise Institute; John J. DiIulio, Jr., Princeton University; Julia Graham Lear, George Washington University; and Diane Ravitch, New York University.",

        "Authors": "By Hart, Henry",
        "Description": "A fascinating biography of one of the most popular, colorful, and notorious American poets of our century.The legendary Southern poet James Dickey never shied away from cultivating a heroic mystique.  Like Norman Mailer and Ernest Hemingway, he earned a reputation as a sportsman, boozer, war hero, and womanizer as well as a great poet, novelist, screenwriter, and essayist.  But James Dickey made lying both a literary strategy and a protective camouflage; even his family and closest friends failed to distinguish between the mythical James Dickey and the actual man.  Henry Hart sees lying as the central theme to Dickey's life; and in this authoritative, immensely entertaining biography he delves deep behind Dickey's many masks.  Letters, anecdotes, tall tales and true ones, as well as the reluctant but finally candid cooperation of Dickey himself animate Hart's narration of a remarkable life.  Readers of Dickey's National Book Award-winning poetry, his bestselling novel Deliverance, and anyone who witnessed his electrifying readings of his work will savor this book.",

It seems that Mignon Cosmetics' animal-testing policies have made them the target of \"Spare the Hares.\" And there's worse to come. On the day of the banquet, as Goldy struggles to carry forty pounds of low-fat fare from her van to the mall, she hears an ominous squeal of tires and a horrifying thump.",

A well-stocked supermarket today carries a variety of fresh and dried chiles, fresh cilantro, myriad dried and canned beans, chipotle powder, and all the makings for sides and salsas, from tortillas in the refrigerator case to organic avocados. Jane Butel's Chili Madness has been praised as \"an elegant celebration\" (Travel + Leisure) that \"chile lovers will love\" (New York Post), it's the spicy bestseller with over 330,000 copies in print. Extensively revised, updated, and expanded, the book will fire up a whole new generation of chili fanatics. Of the 160-plus recipes, more than 130 are brand-new. Here are classics, including Reno Red and Navajo Green and Buzzard\u2019s Breath Chili, as well as newfangled bowls like Moroccan Chili and White Lobster Chili. To accompany the main event are savory breads (Bacon Crumble Cornbread); tempting sidekicks (Hot \u2019n\u2019 Spicy Okra, Red Hot Sweet Potato Lace); fire-taming salads (Crispy Cilantro Coleslaw); and margaritas, of course.

In fact, no issue has become more topical or polarizing in the United States than the intersection of religion and politics, with the country seemingly irreconcilably split between the \u201creligious right\u201d and the \u201csecular left.\u201dIn this \u201cdynamic, hopeful\u201d (The Nation) book, Wallis, the nationally known activist, preacher, and editor of Sojourners magazine, shows why both the traditional liberal and conservative visions are inadequate to the challenge before us, and outlines instead a new political morality combining social justice with individual responsibility.

Her sixty-five-year-old male protagonist, the recently widowed Judge Gamaliel Honeywell, falls in love with and marries an impulsive twenty-three-year-old woman, emblem of the 1920s. As the symbol of patriarchy, the Judge espouses all of the chivalrous myths about women, insisting that older women are not interested in love, that a man is only as old as his instincts, and that some young women prefer old lovers to young ones. His sheltered mind allows these dillusions about women as it allows him to delude himself.",

This valuable manual truly belongs on every woman's bookshelf.",

        "Description": "Sisters. They are the best of friends, the worst of friends. They can be as bullying as a big brother or as loving as the most endearing mother. They can be so alike in personality and style you can't tell them apart, or so totally opposite that you'd swear they came from different families. Yet, whatever their disparities, they are inextricably bound by their female gender.In this groundbreaking book, Barbara Mathias, herself a sister to six siblings, brings both professional and personal insight into the sister connection. Using colorful stories from real lives as well as interviews with experts in the fields of psychology, family relations, and women's studies, Barbara Mathias illustrates the dynamics of a crucial relationship that has not been given the attention it deserves.Guiding the reader through the maze and mystery of familial sisterhood, Mathias explores the wide range of intricate emotions...of jealousy, fury, and painful guilt...and of closeness, respect, and compatibility...of the diversity and the similarity between women who, no matter what their circumstances, are indelibly joined.Between Sisters is a revealing study of one of the most significant relationships in a woman's life. Whether good or bad, loving or estranged, this complex connection exerts a lasting and powerful influence on every sister. Its invisible pull affects the way a woman raises a family, relates to her husband and her friends, and how she functions in her career.With the understanding gained from this revealing book, you will not only change the way you see your sister and yourself, but find new value in the instinctual bond that links you.",
