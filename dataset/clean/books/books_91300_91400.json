        "Description": "What will you build your life on?With startling transparency, Joshua Harris shares how we can rediscover the relevance and power of Christian truth. This is book shows a young man who rose quickly to success in the Christian evangelical world before he realized his spirituality lacked a foundation\u2014it rested more on tradition and morality than on an informed knowledge of God. For the indifferent or spiritually numb, Harris's humorous and engaging reflections on Christian beliefs show that orthodoxy isn't just for scholars\u2014it is for anyone who longs to know the living Jesus Christ. As Harris writes, \"I've come to learn that theology matters. It matters not because we want to impress people, but because what we know about God shapes the way we think and live. Theology matters because if we get it wrong then our whole life will be wrong.\"Whether you are just exploring Christianity or you are a veteran believer finding yourself overly familiar and cold-hearted, Dug Down Deep will help you rediscover the timeless truths of Scripture. As Harris challenges you to root your faith and feelings about God in the person, work, and words of Jesus, he answers questions such as:    \u2022 What is God like and how does he speak to me?    \u2022 What difference does it make that Jesus was both human and divine?    \u2022 How does Jesus's death on the cross pay for my sins?    \u2022 Who is the Holy Spirit and how does he work in my life? With grace and wisdom, Harris will inspire you to revel in the truth that has captured his own mind and heart. He will ask you to dig deep into a faith so solid you can build your life on it. He will point you to something to believe in again.",

S. Congressman to presidential contender. Known as \"Dr. No\" for his refusal to spend taxpayer money unnecessarily, Paul repeatedly overcame substantial opposition to become a nationally recognized political figure, grabbing the spotlight in American politics despite a media that was determined to ignore him. This compelling portrait also chronicles how Paul's 2008 campaign broke several fund-raising records through its innovative use of the Internet, culminating in a new movement for freedom.",

In the searching of our souls demanded by this challenge . . . kindred spirits across the nation must confront the most fundamental liberal failure of the current era: the failure to embrace a moral vision of America based on the transcendent faith that human beings are more than the sum of their material appetites, our country is more than an economic machine, and freedom is not license but responsibility\u2014the gift we have received and the legacy we must bequeath. \u201cAlthough our sojourn in life is brief, we are on a great journey. For those who came before us and for those who follow, our moral, political, and religious duty to make sure that this nation, which was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all are equal under the law, is in good hands on our watch.\u201d \u2014from \u201cFor America\u2019s Sake\u201dPeople know Bill Moyers mostly from his many years of\u00a0path-breaking journalism on television. But he is also one of America\u2019s most sought-after public speakers. His appearances draw\u00a0sell-out crowds across the country and are among the most reproduced on the Web. \u201cAnd one reason,\u201d writes noted journalist Bill McKibben, \u201cis that Moyers pulls no punches. His understanding of America\u2019s history is at least as deep as his understanding of Christian tradition, which is an integral part of his background . . . With his feet firmly planted in the deepest American traditions, Bill Moyers is helping to keep alive an oratorical tradition that is fading after two centuries. Trained by his career in broadcasting, he writes for the ear, his cadences and his repetitions timed to bring an audience to full realization of its role and its power.\u201d And that is the message of this book. Moyers on Democracy collects many of Bill Moyers\u2019s\u00a0most moving statements to connect the dots on what is happening to our country\u2014the twinned growth of private wealth and public squalor, the assault on our Constitution, the undermining of the electoral process, the accelerating class war against ordinary (and vulnerable) Americans inherent in the growth of economic inequality, the dangers of an imperial executive, the attack\u00a0on the independence of the press, the despoiling of the earth we share as our common gift\u2014and to rekindle the reader\u2019s conviction that \u201cthe gravediggers of democracy will not have the last word.\u201d Richly insightful and alive with a fierce, abiding love for our country, Moyers on Democracy is essential reading in this fateful presidential year.",

The author, Mr. John Morse&#150;a noted art historian and critic&#150;provides brief biographical entries for each of the fifty painters, and longer essays analyzing the significance of their work. The book is lavishly illustrated with large full-page color plates as well as over one hundred black-and-white illustrations.

By picking up The Complete A**hole's Guide to Handling Chicks, you are just pages away from finally understanding:- How a five-dollar date can get you laid- How to stop being friends with girls and start getting them in the sack- Where you'll have the best odds of finding a one-night stand, and how to get rid of the chick the next morning- How to trick a woman into thinking you're classy, even if you have holes in your underwear- Why fat chicks always try to keep you from banging their hot friends, and how to finally stop these evil creatures- How to stop your wife from nagging you into an early grave- Why it's possible to watch six hours of football, put the moves on your neighbor's hot daughter, and leave the toilet seat up in the same day- And much moreThe Complete A**hole's Guide isn't like all the other candy-ass relationship books on the market; it doesn't cover issues like romance, love, and finding Miss Right. So, if that's what you're looking for, there are plenty of other books you can hide under your skirt as you skip out of the store. This book is about controlling the women in your life, and never having to say you're sorry . . . EVER AGAIN!We'll take you from the day you're born to the day you die and show you how women can be manipulated, frustrated, and ultimately dominated throughout the course of a man's life. By illustrating the insanity of the female mind, we'll show you why the flawed chick psyche causes them to continuously fall for the a**hole, no matter how many times they get burned. If you're not interested, that's fine. We're sure there are ballet classes you need to attend before your wine and cheese party. However, if you are ready, then grab a six-pack, order a pizza, and get your hand out of your pants because you're about to read the most perverse, sadistic, and hysterical relationship book ever written.
