The second edition features a new chapter on receiving and responding to Internet complaints; a new chapter on how to deal with and take advantage of complaints that are directed at you personally; and, turning the tables, a section on how you can complain constructively and effectively. And throughout, the text has been heavily revised, with a wealth of new examples, tools, and strategies.",

The savage, senseless shooting of the elderly store owners shocks neighbors and police, yet no one is more distraught than county prosecutor Gardner Lawson - for the state's sole witness is Gardner's only son. Worse yet, whoever killed the Bowers left the eight-year-old unconscious, with the imprint of a gun barrel on his forehead. So traumatized is the boy that he cannot remember anything. No one can get through to him, not even his father.Spotted near the scene of the crime, a town bully has been pegged as the key suspect. He responds evasively to questioning, and Gardner is positive the state has found its man. But his close friend, police sergeant Joseph Brown, isn't so sure. He digs deeper, and starts unearthing a tangled trail of lies leading to a secret as horrifying as the crime itself. And waiting in the wings for Gardner and his allies is his adversary Kent King, a clever, antagonistic defense attorney all too willing to take advantage of Gardner's escalating emotional stake in the case.In the courtroom and out, pressure mounts as he tries to help the boy face the nightmarish truth. Now Gardner is torn between his thirst for justice and the primal, parental drive to protect his child. As the killer roams free, Gardner must ask himself: Will the ultimate cost of a conviction be the life of his son?A profoundly moving, explosive thriller that incorporates both legal expertise and powerful narrative technique, SILENT SON confirms Gallatin Warfield's place as a new master of courtroom suspense.",

In his earlier book, the author developed concrete methods for managing software development and maintenance. These methods, now commonly practiced in industry, provide programmers and managers with specific steps they can take to evaluate and improve their software capabilities. In this new book, Humphrey scales those methods down to a personal level, helping software engineers develop the skills and habits needed to plan, track, and analyze large, complex projects.Humphrey and others have used material from this book to train professionals and students around the world in a projects-oriented software engineering course. First establishing the need for discipline in software engineering, and the benefits to practitioners of learning how to manage their personal software process, Humphrey then develops a model that they can use to monitor, test, and improve their work. Examples drawn from industry enhance the practical focus of the book, while project exercises give readers the opportunity to practice software process management as they learn it.Features: presents concepts and methods for a disciplined software engineering process; scales down industrial practices for planning, tracking, analysis, and defect management to fit the needs of small-scale program development; and shows how small project disciplines provide a solid base for larger projects.",

This wide-ranging collection will fill every nook and cranny of your brain with information you'll surely never need, but will enjoy learning anyway!  Did you know...  - that penguins can jump six feet out of the water? - that everyone is color-blind at birth?  Would you care to know...  - what the first meal eaten on the moon was? - what country drinks the most Coca-Cola? (Hint: It's not the United States.)  In 1995, a secret society was formed comprising Britain's foremost thinkers, writers, and artists to trade and share in useless information (or, as founding member Keith Waterhouse, playwright and journalist, would have it, \"totally bloody useless\").",

But as his blog\u2019s popularity grew, Buzzell became the embedded reporter the Army couldn\u2019t control\u2014despite its often hilarious efforts to do so. The result is an extraordinary narrative, rich with unforgettable scenes: the Iraqi woman crying uncontrollably during a raid on her home; the soldier too afraid to fight; the troops chain-smoking in a guard tower and counting tracer rounds; the first, fierce firefight against the \u201cmen in black.\u201d Drawing comparisons to everything from Charles Bukowski to Catch-22, My War depicts a generation caught in a complicated and dangerous world\u2014and marks the debut of a raw, remarkable new voice.",

While the cause of death is clear, the officer's identity is not. With nerve ends raw from the media focus on recent scandals, the Pentagon bypasses its own investigative service and appoints a commander, Dan Collins, and a civilian, Grace Snow, to conduct an inquiry. Together they resolve to ignore the Navy's political sensitivities and conduct a by-the-book murder investigation. But then they uncover evidence that points back to Washington, D.C., and a two-year-old unsolved case involving another black Navy lieutenant, a beautiful young woman, who died under violent circumstances. While they search for links between the two deaths, they attract the attention of one Malachi Ward. Cunning, ruthless, well paid, and ferociously resourceful, he will do whatever it takes to protect his hidden client's privilege. In a tense, deadly game of cat-and-mouse, Malachi tracks Collins and Snow through Washington's streets and corridors of power, determined to keep them from learning the secret behind the body in the battleship.",

Although he's seen the many successful unions of his Cynster connections, he has also watched his father's obsessions nearly destroy their family and fortune, a mistake Charles will not repeat. But as Lord Meredith he must marry, so he offers for Sarah, the daughter of his neighbors Lord and Lady Conningham. She's intelligent enough to run his social life, beautiful enough to grace his arm, and old enough to know the value of his offer. For most young ladies of the ton, the right marriage is the culmination of years of training, perfect deportment, and intricate plans that would impress a general. But as a lady of independent means with a life of her own, Sarah is unwilling to wed unless it is for unbounded love.But Charles always gets what he wants. He convinces Sarah to give him two weeks to win her; if he succeeds, they will marry immediately. And so begins an intense courtship. By day, Charles and Sarah are models of decorum indulging in innocuous walks, polite conversation, sedate waltzes. Each night they steal away to the lush, moonlit gardens, where sensual embraces turn to searing kisses, and much, much more. Both are swept away on a tide of passion and feeling neither can resist.And yet, after the wedding, despite nights of insatiable passion, Charles remains aloof, as if the near-sinful sweetness of their nights exists only in a dream. Sarah battles to prove that true love is a force that can't be contained, a gift worth fighting for, but it's only when she's engulfed in a web of increasingly dangerous incidents that Charles discovers how much he's willing to surrender to protect . . . the taste of innocence.",

This amazing clan -- and their friends -- is a bold, powerful group of men who let nothing stand in their way when it comes to matters of the heart. And in this, Stephanie Laurens's newest novel, a passionate man and a daring woman confront the ultimate question. . . .What Price Love?There is nothing more fascinating than a darkly handsome rake, especially one as controlled and elusive as Dillon Caxton, prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Demon Cynster. Despite his dangerous air, Dillon is a man of sterling reputation, but it wasn't always so. Years ago, an illicit scheme turned into a nefarious swindle, and only the help of his cousin, Felicity, and her husband, Demon, saved Dillon from ruin. Now impeccably honest, he guards his hard-won reputation and is the Keeper of the Register of all racing horses in England. His standing and aloofness make Dillon undeniably desirable to young ladies, but despite all the lures thrown his way, he remains uninterested -- his attention unfixed.Until \"Miss Priscilla Dalling\" erupts into his life. A stunning beauty, she affects Dillon as no other ever has, but what fascinates him even more is that this tempting young lady is clearly desperate, and equally clearly lying about wanting to see the Register to fulfill the whim of an eccentric aunt.Lady Priscilla Dalloway will do anything to see what's in the Register -- even lie! Her twin brother, Russell, who had fought with their father and left the family home to work with the finest racehorses, has disappeared. Pris knows that clues to his whereabouts can be found in the tome Dillon Caxton refuses to let her see.She unleashes her feminine wiles on Dillon -- to no avail. But Dillon is now determined to learn the truth behind her quest. Exploiting the powerful attraction that flares between them, he succeeds in convincing Pris to tell him all, to trust him with her twin's life. Together, Dillon and Pris locate Rus, only to discover that his life is being threatened by the perpetrators of a massive betting swindle.The time is ripe for Dillon to repay old debts by helping another as he himself was helped.

And along the way they discover the answer to that age-old question: What price love?",

        "Authors": "By Coll, Steve",
        "Description": "The rise and rise of the Bin Laden family is one of the great stories of the twentieth century; its repercussions have   already deeply marked the twenty-first. Until now, however, it is a story that has never been fully told, as the Bin   Ladens have successfully fended off attempts to understand the family circles from which Osama sprang. In this the   family has been abetted by the kingdom it calls home, Saudi Arabia, one of the most closed societies on earth.      Steve Coll\u2019s The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century is the groundbreaking history of a   family and its fortune. It chronicles a young illiterate Yemeni bricklayer, Mohamed Bin Laden, who went to the new,   oil-rich country of Saudi Arabia and quickly became a vital figure in its development, building great mosques and   highways and making himself and many of his children millionaires. It is also a story of the Saudi royal family, whom   the Bin Ladens served loyally and without whose capricious favor they would have been nothing. And it is a story of   tensions and contradictions in a country founded on extreme religious purity, which then became awash in oil   money and dazzled by the temptations of the West. In only two generations the Bin Ladens moved from a famine-  stricken desert canyon to luxury jets, yachts, and private compounds around the world, even going into business   with Hollywood celebrities. These religious and cultural gyrations resulted in everything from enthusiasm for   America\u2014exemplified by Osama\u2019s free-living pilot brother Salem\u2014to an overwhelming determination to destroy   it.    The Bin Ladens is a meticulously researched, colorful, shocking, entertaining, and disturbing narrative of   global integration and its limitations. It encapsulates the unsettling contradictions of globalization in the story of a   single family who has used money, mobility, and technology to dramatically varied ends.",
