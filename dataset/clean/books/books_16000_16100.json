        "Description": "Richard Carlson provides one hundred new strategies for living more fully and worrying less as a means of attracting more wealth and abundance in our lives. Often we get into the trap of thinking that the only way to earn a good living is to stay late at the office, feeling stressed out and full of anxiety. However, this can actually get in the way of having a productive and rewarding career, and can drastically decrease our earnings. In thought-provoking, unique pieces, Carlson shows us how to invest in the market, instead of worrying about it; how to get real mileage out of reflection; how to make a truly great impression on clients; how taking your lunch break (instead of working through it) may pay off in more ways than you think; and how we shouldn't rely on too much data in making decisions.\"Accept the fact that you can make excuses, or you can make money, but you can't do both,\" Carlson tells us, as he shows us how to spend most of our work time on the \"critical inch\" of our business, instead of on the peripheral agendas that don't really earn the big bucks. He tells us how to be prepared to walk away from any negotiation, and how this attitude will help us to strike better deals. And he reveals specific money strategies, such as why it's better to buy large deductible insurance, how to decide between a fixed and variable interest rate on a mortgage, and how to save two years of living expenses for when the unexpected happens.Full of interesting and unique ideas for the overworked business person, Don't Worry, Make Money shows readers how to live a life that's more wealthy, productive, and carefree by refusing to let worry get you down.",

In this refreshingly original book, Joshua Halberstam shows us how to develop a moral imagination\u2014and have fun while doing it.Halberstam demolishes the clich\u00e9s of both religion and psychotherapy and entices us into looking at the small actions that make up the big picture of our character and values. Should we really refrain from making judgments? Should we let our conscience be our guide even if it urges us not to pay our taxes? Halberstam has something intriguing to say about these and many other issues. Witty and entertaining, Everyday Ethics is the moral equivalent of an aerobic dance session, as exhilarating as it is instructive.",

For one thing, pilgrim children didn't go to school. Instead, they helped their parents with chores and played games such as marbles. There were no convenient grocery stores. Pilgrims had to hunt and gather food, then cook their meals on an open fire or in an outdoor oven. Dramatic photos of historical reenactments combine with lively text to give today's children a vivid sense of daily life in Plymouth colony. Here is a great book for fostering an early interest in history!",

One is Dora -- large, voluptuous, and charismatic -- a prostitute to whom men are drawn for pleasure, women for friendship. Her strange death in an icy ravine affects everyone in the tiny village: her enormous, slow-minded son; an embittered midwife; the hunchbacked lord of the manor; his decaying mother; and an itin- erant portrait painter, whose arrival in the village unearths secrets and passions beyond anyone's expectations.  The other -- young, slight, and solitary -- is a dutiful chambermaid to the mistress of the manor until Dora's accident begins to distract her from her daily tasks. Her quest to uncover the truth about the prostitute's mysterious life and sudden death leads her to a terrible discovery, and the beginnings of a future.  A novel about murder, flesh, fertility, desire, medicine, and art, Bone House transports readers to stratified Elizabethan England, where the body -- or \"bone house\" -- had a primary role in deter-mining one's destiny. Sensual, sophisticated, and fiercely compelling, this is an uncommonly assured debut.",

        "Description": "AFTERMATH is set in the blue-collar town of East Breed\u2019s, Pennsylvania. It is the dead of winter and the town simmers with barely concealed prejudices and unspoken rules, dividing the rich from the poor, the successful from the struggling. One Friday night in the parking lot of a chain restaurant, the tension erupts in a brutal fight between the privileged boys from St. Brendan\u2019s and a group of kids from the local high school. Casey Fielder, the restaurant\u2019s manager, watches the melee but does nothing to stop it. Once before he had called the police, only to be reprimanded by the home office. This time, he sticks to the corporate rules. When the fight ends, Colin Chase, a handsome, cocky student at St. Brendan\u2019s, is left severely brain-damaged. In a compelling and at times heartbreaking narrative, Brian Shawver portrays the lasting effects of one night. Casey, ostracized by his unforgivable failure to act, loses his job, his girlfriend, and his sense of self-worth. For Lea, Colin\u2019s mother, the incident ironically offers a way to reclaim the defiant, arrogant son she hardly knew and could barely love. Although she hopes that the guilty boy will be found and punished, Lea can\u2019t escape the feeling that Colin somehow brought the horror upon himself. As she looks for clues that will help her understand him, she discovers his apparent devotion to a young woman named Jenny, and she seizes on this relationship as the key that will finally allow her to love her son unconditionally.",

But millions of people make up the working poor in the U.S. Rooted in powerful new research and personal narratives, Raise the Floor makes the case for a livable minimum wage and shows how good wages are good business.Raise the Floor illustrates how the current annual minimum wage income of $10,712 a year just doesn\u2019t add up. For example, to make ends meet, two parents with two children would have work more than three full-time minimum wage jobs\u201466 hours a week\u2014leaving little time for sleep, family outings, religious services, or participating in community activities with their kids.In a January 2002 poll of likely voters, Americans overwhelmingly identified raising the minimum wage as key to stimulating the economy. By a resounding 77 percent, these voters favored increasing the minimum wage to $8 an hour\u2014the amount a single, full-time worker needs to meet minimum needs.Raise the Floor is written in a lively, readable style and includes boxed quotes from folks in all walks of life who recognize the need for practical solutions to ending poverty.

In the very distant past, a man was born who had a wife, who had a child, who grew up and had children in turn, and so there was a bloodline stretching to today. And Leonardo da Vinci knew all about it and recorded it in a painting for everyone to see, despite lots of Bad People trying to cover up the whole thing. And the man with the Very Cunning Theory figured all this out from lots of clues and pictures that Leonardo da Vinci had cunningly concealed, and then published it for everyone to see.But then it turned out that this Very Cunning Theory was Not So Cunning After All because it wasn't true. Not even remotely. Not even a tiny bit likely. Which is where this book comes in.Because it turns out that although Leonardo da Vinci didn't know anything at all about a holy bloodline extending to the present day, he knew a very great deal indeed about what cod really are, and that sinister knowledge is only now coming to light ...FishclaimerThis book has not been authorized or endorsed by Dan Brown or his publishers, but it is much, much funnier.",

        "Description": "For Your Own Good, the contemporary classic exploring the serious if not gravely dangerous consequences parental cruelty can bring to bear on children everywhere, is one of the central works by Alice Miller, the celebrated Swiss psychoanalyst.With her typically lucid, strong, and poetic language, Miller investigates the personal stories and case histories of various self-destructive and/or violent individuals to expand on her theories about the long-term affects of abusive child-rearing. Her conclusions\u2014on what sort of parenting can create a drug addict, or a murderer, or a Hitler\u2014offer much insight, and make a good deal of sense, while also straying far from psychoanalytic dogma about human nature, which Miller vehemently rejects.This important study paints a shocking picture of the violent world\u2014indeed, of the ever-more-violent world\u2014that each generation helps to create when traditional upbringing, with its hidden cruelty, is perpetuated. The book also presents readers with useful solutions in this regard\u2014namely, to resensitize the victimized child who has been trapped within the adult, and to unlock the emotional life that has been frozen in repression.",

In its earlier days Winterthur was the family home where Ruth du Pont Lord grew up and where her father, Henry F. du Pont (1880\u20131969), envisioned and then brought to fruition his great museum of Americana.In this memoir, Ruth Lord engagingly describes the development of Henry F. du Pont from a shy, lonely child, a seemingly hopeless student who had bad times at school, to a man who went on to achieve singular distinction in three disparate fields\u2014as art connoisseur, horticulturist, and eminent cattle breeder. Based on her personal experience, and on extraordinary family archives, the author provides a behind-the-scenes view of the legendary lifestyle of the du Pont family, brings to life other family members, including her brilliant mother and irrepressible aunt, Louise Crowninshield, and tells of her father\u2019s many additional activities, which culminated in his leadership role in Jacqueline Kennedy\u2019s White House restoration.",

        "Description": "Singer. Actress. Producer. Director. Activist. Wife. Mother. Lover. Barbra Streisand has risen from humble beginnings to become one of the most talented, versatile, and influential women of our time. In STREISAND: Her Life, best-selling\u00a0\u00a0biographer James Spada delivers the definitive biography of this one-woman conglomerate.Based on more than 200 interviews with Streisand's friends, relatives, and colleagues, along with never-before conducted research, Spada uncovers surprising and often startling details of this very private star's life.\u00a0\u00a0\"For 30 years she has surprised, delighted, angered, polarized, and riveted the public,\" Spada says. \"She is still going where many tell her not to.\"In STREISAND, Spada\u00a0\u00a0traces the life and career of Barbra with equal depth. Born and raised in Brooklyn, Streisand began performing in her teens as an actress; she only began singing on a dare. But it was because of her voice, which brought her cabaret bookings in the early 1960s, that she initially became famous.Never conventionally beautiful, she knew she had to make her talent outshine her looks, and always refused to remake herself to anyone else's liking. That sense of resolve and single-mindedness paid off in the years to come, as success followed success: a record deal, the big break in Funny Girl on both stage and screen, and the transition from Broadway darling to the toast of Hollywood. As her movie career developed, the appeal of branching out into production and then direction became even stronger. Her 1983 directorial debut, Yentl, and her second film The Prince of Tides  earned both box-office dollars and critical acclaim. An avid supporter of AIDS research and other charitable causes, Barbra has become more involved than ever in recent years as a political and social activist, but always continues to grow and take risks as an artist.In STREISAND, Spada delivers not only a thorough look at this celebrity's multi-faceted career but also an in-depth examination of her\u00a0\u00a0well-guarded personal life. We learn about her lovers, including Elliott Gould, Jon Peters, Don Johnson, and Elvis Presley, among others; her parents, including her complicated relationships with her mother and her abusive stepfather; and her son, including how she dealt with his homosexuality. Spada also provides a complete filmography and an annotated discography of the star's work, along with 32 pages of photographs.",

Utilising untapped archival materials in both the USA and UK, government documents, family papers, and oral histories, Hirshson creates the most balanced portrait of Patton ever written. It reveals Patton as a complex soldier capable of brilliant military manoeuvres but also of inspiring his troops with fiery speeches that resulted in horrendous acts, such as the massacres of Italian civilians. It explains Patton\u2032s belief in a soldier\u2032s Valhalla, connects the family\u2032s wealth to one of America\u2032s bitterest labour strikes, and disputes the usual interpretation of Patton\u2032s relief from command of the Third Army. In investigating this complex man, Hirshson has uncovered surprising material about a series of civilian massacres in Sicily, about the two slapping incidents, about attempts to exploit Patton\u2032s diary after his death, and about Patton\u2032s relations with top Allied generals. Patton emerges as a soldier of great imagination and courage, and his military campaigns make for edge-of-the-seat reading. All the drama of Patton\u2032s life comes alive in this meticulously documented volume.",
