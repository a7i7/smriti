        "Authors": "By Chamberlin, Beth and Hills, Lorelei",
        "Description": "When Lorelei Hills, the tough, vivacious character from TV's beloved \"Guiding Light,\" wakes up in Mexico, she asks, \"who am I?\" What she wants and needs to know desperately is her name, where she's from and how she came to be in a stranger's bed.Lorelei's Guiding Light: An Intimate Diary is the inside story of one woman's struggle to come to terms with her identity and to emerge as a force to be reckoned with.  Here is the Lorelei that viewers of the show have never seen--the history and emotions, the hopes and dreams that have made her the star of an unforgettable human drama.  Learn all the hidden details about her lost days and nights in Mexico, her high-roller life in New York, her childhood in Virginia. And experience in-depth her innermost thoughts, schemes and desires that have never emerged on the screen. From the moment she teams up with the character you love to hate, Edmund Winslow, to impersonate Lorelei's late lookalike Beth Raines in order to claim Beth's fortune, family and very possibly her ex-husband (the deeply attractive Phillip Spaulding) this book is unputdownable, the ultimate record of a secret life, written in Lorelei's own impossible-to-imitate style.As written by Beth Chamberlin, the actress who portrays both Lorelei Hills and Beth Raines, this page turner is filled with intrigue, gossip, deceit and, of course, plenty of romance--in short, everything you expect from \"Guiding Light...\" and more.",

        "Title": "Irish Art Now: From the Poetic to the Political",
        "Authors": "By O'Toole, Fintan and McGonagle, Declan",
        "Description": "Reflecting the seismic changes in Ireland's political, social, economic, and cultural realities of the 1990s, contemporary Irish artists have begun to redefine identities, raising questions about the relationships between male and female, urban and rural, North and South, history and the present. The struggle over identities, which used to marginalize Ireland and societies like it, has now become central to debates around the globe.This strikingly illustrated book presents a reading of Irish art in the 1990s and examines the repositioning of Irish identity in works drawn primarily from the collection of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin.The artists examined, including Kathy Prendergast, Willie Doherty, and Alice Maher, have initiated a dialogue with their own society and others beyond Ireland, using painting, photography, sculpture, video, and installation to explore subjects ranging from the personal and poetic to the political. Their concerns - and the way they are conveyed through non-traditional materials and new interpretations of more conventional media - link these works to new art being made elsewhere in the world.This publication accompanies an exhibition touring the United States and Canada.",

        "Description": "The Irish have always had a way with words.  Long ago they took on a language not their own and learned to re-word it into pure magic.  Nowhere is this magic more in evidence than in their short stories\u2014stories that combine lyricism, humor and tragedy with rare imagination set in simple backgrounds, largely without props. The seemingly effortless art of the best Irish writers has an appeal that is naive and highly sophisticated at the same time; the disarming simplicity with which the tales are spun being somewhat misleading at first reading.  In this anthology there are gathered, for the first time in America, some of the more representative examples of Irish short fiction.  The emphasis is on variety.  All are a delight to read.  All have universal appeal.  Only 21 of the 44 have previously been published in this country.",

Their work may lead to the discovery of higher life forms in the Jovian system-with implications the New Morality doesn't like at all.What Grant's would-be controllers don't know is that his loyalty to science may be greater than his desire for a quiet life.

Few believe the tribe exists -- and even fewer suspect its deity may hold knowledge that can change the course of history.For National Underwater & Marine Agency crew leader Kurt Austin, an investigation into the sudden deaths of rare whales leads him to the Mexican coast, where someone tries to put him and his mini-sub permanently out of commission.

        "Authors": "By Wills, Garry",
        "Description": "In his Pulitzer Prize- and National Book Critics Circle Award-winning Lincoln at Gettysburg, Garry Wills reframed our understanding of Lincoln the leader. Wills breathed new life into words we thought we knew and revealed much about a President so mythologized but often misunderstood. He showed how Lincoln's personality was less at issue than his followers' values and Lincoln's exquisite ability, in a mere 272 words, to reach them, to give the whole nation \"a new birth of freedom,\" and to weave a spell that has not yet been broken.Now Wills extends his extraordinary quality of observation and iconoclastic scholarship to examine the nature of leadership itself, perhaps history's most pivotal and emotionally charged topic. Almost the first thing people say about leaders is that we used to have them but now do not. Some blame this on the press, or on television, or on education. Others say we are manipulated, not led. Still others pore over book after book, searching for the perfect exemplar to imitate in order to achieve success.Wills offers a wide range of portraits drawn largely, but not exclusively, from American history and representing revolutionary, political, religious, business, artistic, sports, and military leaders - Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harriet Tubman, Eleanor Roosevelt, Andrew Young, Napoleon, King David, Ross Perot, George Washington, Socrates, Mary Baker Eddy, Carl Stotz, Martha Graham, Martin Luther King, Jr., Cesare Borgia, and Dorothy Day - each shown in the act of leading his or her followers. And after each example, Wills also provides an anti-type to help define the type better.He moves beyond the traditional study of elected officials and business giants, past the usual emphasis on glamour, forceful personality, or technique, to look at leaders of different scope and particular talents. Wills shows how leaders are shaped by the very circumstances in which they must shape others' actions. No one, after all, can be a leader without followers. Only the vital interplay of wills between leaders and followers can direct them both toward a goal.In Certain Trumpets leadership is not a static pose but becomes an exhilarating partnership. Once again Garry Wills has transformed the lens through which we see our leaders, our society, and ourselves.",

        "Authors": "By Shapiro, Robert and Warren, Larkin",
        "Description": "From June 13, 1994, to October 3, 1995, Robert Shapiro stood in the middle of a drama that held millions of Americans in thrall. Now for the first time, the architect of the defense strategy tells the inside story of the O.J. Simpson trial from the beginning. In this book, the man who assembled the \"dream team\" answers the questions of fact, law, and ethics that were fired at him before and after the jury's verdict. With candor, wit, and compassion, Shapiro brings to light the details of what has been called \"the trial of the century,\" giving us revealing glimpses of the defendant and the others whose names became so familiar: Johnnie Cochran, F. Lee Bailey, Marcia Clark, Barry Scheck, Chris Darden, and Judge Lance Ito.At the heart of the book is the dramatic story of how Shapiro planned the defense strategy against what appeared to be overwhelming odds. Within minutes of his first meeting with O.J., he started \"thinking like the prosecution,\" lining up a powerful arsenal of lawyers, investigators, and expert witnesses to counter what the prosecution claimed was an open-and-shut case. In the midst of mounting the legal defense, Shapiro also had to deal with the tumult of a media circus, a fractious defense team, and his own priorities as a husband and father. Through it all, he maintained a steady hand and the quiet belief that justice would prevail. Confronting the prosecution's \"mountain of evidence,\" Shapiro and his defense team uncovered the elements of reasonable doubt in the faulty handling of blood samples and other mistakes made by the police as they rushed to erroneous conclusions.Robert Shapiro's reasoned and principled arguments about the Bill of Rights and the role and duty of a defense attorney will deepen our understanding of the verdict, the trial, and the place this story occupied in the American culture. Answering critics who charge that \"loopholes\" and legal tactics prevailed over justice, Shapiro convincingly demonstrates that the only possible verdict - even without the race card Johnnie Cochran flung on the table - was the conclusion of \"reasonable doubt\" reached by the jury.",

It is, indeed, the extraordinary social welfare commitment these programs represent and their concomitant expense that provoke such determined support and such fiscal concern. Kingson and Berkowitz provide a thorough, balanced, and highly accessible explanation of Social Security and Medicare. They explain the dilemmas facing policymakers and describe, through historical development, how the programs evolved and their present status. The authors superbly convey the complexity of issues while also clearly presenting the factual information essential to the understanding and discussion. Such key considerations as the adequacy of protection, the financing problems, issues of fairness, the response to disability, and the health care needs of the elderly are particularly focused on--the authors' are sensitive to the social welfare nature of the programs. A truly essential book not only for the classroom but the offices and living rooms of writers, administrators, planners, policymakers, social service practitioners, and the general public.",

Kate has always been a wanderer. A well-published author, married many times, she has lived a life rich with explorations of the natural world and the human soul. Now, at fifty-seven, she leaves her lover, Yolo, to embark on a new excursion, one that begins on the Colorado River, proceeds through the past, and flows, inexorably, into the future. As Yolo begins his own parallel voyage, Kate encounters celibates and lovers, shamans and snakes, memories of family disaster and marital discord, and emerges at a place where nothing remains but love. Told with the accessible style and deep feeling that are its author\u2019s hallmarks, Now Is the Time to Open Your Heart is Alice Walker\u2019s most surprising achievement.",

And nothin' is as important to Forrest as his Mama and what she taught him about life and love. You can take a chocolate, Forrest learned, and when you bite down, it may not be the one you wanted. But it's yours from then on. And you need to remember to enjoy it. \"Life ain't so much different,\" says Forrest. And his Mama never let him forget it.If Forrest wasn't lovin' his Mama's shrimp, he was lovin' her chocolate. Forrest already said grace over The Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Cookbook. So now he's takin' time to give his blessing to his Mama's chocolate recipes. His Mama always knew the place to go for great recipes was her favorite magazine, Southern Living, which practically invented the best-ever chocolate desserts. Each one of these recipes was tested in their own kitchens for extra goodness.You talk about chocolates! Wait'll you taste Forrest's Fudge Cake or Real Good Chocolate Caramels or Mighty Nice Chocolate Pastry Cake or Chocolate-Pecan Torte or (if you're gonna get fancy) Chocolate-Mint Truffles or plain old Candy Bar Brownies or Alabama Ice Cream Squares or, oh goodness!, an Almond-Macaroon Tart. You may have to put this book down and go cook somethin' before you get a faintin' spell.Just remember what Forrest learned from his Mama: You never know what you're gonna get when you pick up a chocolate. But you do know this - if it comes from this book, it's gonna be plenty good.",

        "Description": "Over the course of two years, Jonathan Tilove and freelance photographer Michael Falco traveled along some of the 650 Martin Luther King Jr. streets, avenues, and boulevards across the country--in Harlem; Belle Glade, Florida; Atlanta; Selma, Alabama; Jackson and Canton, Mississippi; Chicago; Oakland, California; Portland, Oregon; and nearly a score of cities and towns throughout Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.As this journey reveals, life along King is at once tightly conjoined and kaleidoscopically diverse. And that is precisely what Tilove has lyrically portrayed in the writing of this book, and what Falco has so superbly illumined with his rich photographs of the people along Martin Luther King.We meet Annie Williams, who lives  and works on Belle Glade\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, managing the Sudsy City Laundromat, and who likes the idea that every black community she visits now has a main street with a common name; and Marion Tumbleweed Beach, a seventy-three-year-old teacher, writer, poet, reporter, editor, and activist who lives on Martin Luther King Street in Selma, Alabama, but finds the phenomenon a source of dismay: \u201cI say they still get us with trinkets. We go cheap. I resent it.\u201dTilove writes of the King streets: \u201cMap them and you map a nation within a nation, a place where white America seldom goes and black America can be itself. It is a parallel universe with a different center of gravity and distinctive sensibilities, kinship at two or three degrees of separation, not six. There is no other street like it.\u201d",

        "Description": "No one is more qualified to teach you how to train your dog than Dick Maller, president of the U.S. Professional Dog Trainers' Association and operator of the famous Maller School for Dogs, whose dogs have won over 100 awards and have appeared in movies and on television. Here is his easy-to-follow, effective, and above all, humane approach to training your puppy or full-grown dog in only 21 days. Using \"operant conditioning\" and \"positive reinforcement\" as the two basic training techniques, the author shows you:  * how to housebreak your puppy quickly and painlessly * how to break your dog's bad habits (barking, chewing, chasing cars and bicycles, jumping up on visitors, howling when left alone) * how to train your dog to follow simple commands (sit, heel, turn, stay, lie down and come) * how to teach your dog to fetch, jump, catch, carry or retrieve an object.  The simple Maller method is your guide to raising a happy, obedient dog -- one who follows your orders not out of fear (as in traditional training methods), but out of delight in pleasing you -- every time.",
