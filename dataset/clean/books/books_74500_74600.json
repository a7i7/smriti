        "Authors": "By Armstrong, Karen",
        "Description": "Why does God exist? How have the three dominant monotheistic religions\u2014Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\u2014shaped and altered the conception of God? How have these religions influenced each other? In this stunningly intelligent book, Karen Armstrong, one of Britain's foremost commentators on religious affairs, traces the history of how men and women have perceived and experienced God, from the time of Abraham to the present.\u00a0The epic story begins with the Jews' gradual transformation of pagan idol worship in Babylon into true monotheism\u2014a concept previously unknown in the world. Christianity and Islam both rose on the foundation of this revolutionary idea, but these religions refashioned 'the One God' to suit the social and political needs of their followers. From classical philosophy and medieval mysticism to the Reformation, Karen Armstrong performs the near miracle of distilling the intellectual history of monotheism into one superbly readable volume, destined to take its place as a classic.Praise for History of God\u201cAn admirable and impressive work of synthesis that will give insight and satisfaction to thousands of lay readers.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post Book World\u201cA brilliantly lucid, spendidly readable book. [Karen] Armstrong has a dazzling ability: she can take a long and complex subject and reduce it to the fundamentals, without oversimplifying.\u201d\u2014The Sunday Times\u00a0(London)\u201cAbsorbing . . . A lode of learning.\u201d\u2014Time\u201cThe most fascinating and learned study of the biggest wild goose chase in history\u2014the quest for God. Karen Armstrong is a genius.\u201d\u2014A.N.

She helps pastors, worship leaders, and musicians - Understand worship and its attraction for non-Christians - Tear down walls that keep unbelievers from meeting God in church worship - Make worship evangelism happen--in any culture Morgenthaler draws on sound research and her extensive experience as a worship leader to offer an energetic, hands-on approach. Now with a study guide that encourages group discussion and personal action, this timely book offers fresh vision for worship evangelism and provides the strategies to implement it.",

And they touch the most sensitive nerves of our psyches with ironic twists, gross-out shocks, and moral lessons learned the hard way.From the classic tale \"The Mexican Pet\" in which the \"dog\" turns out to be no Chihuahua to the more unappetizing story of condoms as fast-food burger garnish, from surgically skilled kidney thieves to sexual experiments that end in the emergency room, Urban Legends relates more 300 of the most enticing, macabre, and unforgettable tales. Expertly told, they are arranged in such chapters as \"Crazy Little Thang Called Sex,\" \"Oh, Scare Me,\" \"Campus Capers,\" \"Corporate Convolutions,\" and \"So Much For Comfort Food.\"Fascinating, chilling, and occasionally repulsive, Urban Legends has all your favorites and hundreds more.",

        "Description": "When A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court was published in 1889, Mark Twain was undergoing a series of personal and professional crises. Thus what began as a literary burlesque of British chivalry and culture grew into a disturbing satire of modern technology and social thought. The story of Hank Morgan, a nineteenth-century American who is accidentally returned to sixth-century England, is a powerful analysis of such issues as monarchy versus democracy and free will versus determinism, but it is also one of Twain's finest comic novels, still fresh and funny after more than 100 years.",

Ernst, a cross-dressing lounge singer at a seedy nightclub, had many secrets, a never-ending list of lovers, and plenty of opportunities to get into trouble. Hannah delves into the city's dark underbelly to flush out his murderer, but the late night arrival of a five-year-old orphan on her doorstep complicates matters. The endearing Anton claims that Hannah is his mother\u2026 and that her dead brother Ernst is his father. As her investigations into Ernst's murder and Anton's parentage uncover political intrigue and sex scandals in the top ranks of the rising Nazi party, Hannah fears not only for her own life, but for that of a small boy who has come to call her \"mother.\"",

        "Description": "Less a single visual approach than an attitude toward design, the romantic style satisfies our desire for rooms that we and those we love will find pleasurable. Homes decorated in the romantic style range from delightfully casual disorder to elaborate stagings of domestic theater. Whether whimsically enchanted or elegantly restrained, they beckon with the promise of comfort. Warmly lit and dressed in alluring fabrics, they soothe the spirit and tantalize the eye. Unconventional, unrestricted by tradition, and not limited to one historical period or particular geography, the romantic style draws upon many varied tastes and cultural influences. It marries, for example, the femininity of Victorian fashion with the charm of country French or the glamour of Art Deco with the exoticism of the Orient. In the Romantic Style shows how to transform simple, everyday rooms into objects of desire and how, even without an aristocratic purse, it is possible to make romantic rooms out of majestic dreams. It explores the history of romantic design and describes in informative detail how curtains can soften an interior, details can entice the eye, and finishes can make rooms more seductive. 149 color photographs and illustrations.",

        "Description": "David Mamet has said that if he hadn't found a life in the theater, it is very likely he would have become a criminal. In Jafsie and John Henry the master improviser takes on a range of roles and personae in a lively and personal way. Though older and wiser than when he first shocked theatergoers with the play Sexual Perversity in Chicago, Mamet remains one of the most provocative and iconoclastic voices in American writing today, with an idiom so distinct, so American, that it defies comparison. Mamet in this diverse collection turns his unique lens on subjects ranging from houses to Hollywood producers. As the writer turns fifty, he not only shares his reflections on the nature of creativity and the challenges and rewards of aging but delves into his most intimate obsessions. From a description of the labyrinthine psychology of poker to sharp sallies on moviemaking gibberish and the meaning of macho, Jafsie and John Henry is knit together by Mamet's unique perspective and inimitably spare wit. Oscar Wilde, the tower of Babel, The House Committee on Un-American Activities, Jewish scripture, police corruption, the art of acting, and single-malt scotch are all grist for the mill of Mamet's quicksilver mind. He reminisces about his first car, muses on the Lindbergh trial, laments the loss of the art of knifemaking, and lambastes Hollywood culture. The perennial outsider, David Mamet gives us an inside look at the unique world of an American icon and an unromantic perspective on the changing nature of creativity in an artist's life.",

        "Title": "The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11",
        "Authors": "By Yoo, John",
        "Description": "Since the September 11 attacks on the United States, the Bush administration has come under fire for its methods of combating terrorism. Waging war against al Qaeda has proven to be a legal quagmire, with critics claiming that the administration's response in Afghanistan and Iraq is unconstitutional. The war on terror\u2014and, in a larger sense, the administration's decision to withdraw from the ABM Treaty and the Kyoto accords\u2014has many wondering whether the constitutional framework for making foreign affairs decisions has been discarded by the present administration. John Yoo, formerly a lawyer in the Department of Justice, here makes the case for a completely new approach to understanding what the Constitution says about foreign affairs, particularly the powers of war and peace. Looking to American history, Yoo points out that from Truman and Korea to Clinton's intervention in Kosovo, American presidents have had to act decisively on the world stage without a declaration of war. They are able to do so, Yoo argues, because the Constitution grants the president, Congress, and the courts very different powers, requiring them to negotiate the country's foreign policy. Yoo roots his controversial analysis in a brilliant reconstruction of the original understanding of the foreign affairs power and supplements it with arguments based on constitutional text, structure, and history. Accessibly blending historical arguments with current policy debates, The Powers of War and Peace will no doubt be hotly debated. And while the questions it addresses are as old and fundamental as the Constitution itself, America's response to the September 11 attacks has renewed them with even greater force and urgency.\u201cCan the president of the United States do whatever he likes in wartime without oversight from Congress or the courts? This year, the issue came to a head as the Bush administration struggled to maintain its aggressive approach to the detention and interrogation of suspected enemy combatants in the war on terrorism. But this was also the year that the administration\u2019s claims about presidential supremacy received their most sustained intellectual defense [in] The Powers of War and Peace.\u201d\u2014Jeffrey Rosen, New York Times \u201cYoo\u2019s theory promotes frank discussion of the national interest and makes it harder for politicians to parade policy conflicts as constitutional crises. Most important, Yoo\u2019s approach offers a way to renew our political system\u2019s democratic vigor.\u201d\u2014David B. Rivkin Jr. and Carlos Ramos-Mrosovsky, National Review",

        "Title": "Sports Medicine Bible : Prevent, Detect, and Treat Your Sports Injuries Through the Latest Medical Techniques",
        "Authors": "By Micheli, Lyle J. and Jenkins, Mark",
        "Description": "Out of the lifestyle revlutiion of the past quarter century has emerged a new kindof recreational athlete,oen more likely to pursue a physical activity that brings health benefits than to tackle a traditional \"rough-and-tumble\" sport. As a result, \"overuse\" or \"chronic\" injuries, such as \"runner's knee\" and \"swimmer's shoulder\", are increasingly replacing sprains, strains, and breaks as the badge of the weekend Warrior.The sports medicine profession has responded to the rise in overuse injuries by placing greater emphasis on injury prevention, developing new diagnostic and treatment techniques, and promoting rehabilitation as an aid to full recovery. This is what Dr. Lyle J. Micheli, one of the nation's foremost sports medicine authorities, calls the \"new sports medicine.\"In The Sports Medicine Bible, Dr. Micheli responds to the need for more and better answers to the questions posed by recreational athletes desperate for sound medical advice that will help them return to their physical regimens as quickly as possible. He emphasizes strength and flexibility as the keys to injury prevention, encourages early motion rather than immobilization during the rehabilitation process, and recommends other proven techniques that are replacing the sports medicine techniques of past generations.This book covers the whole spectrum of sports medicine, including special sections on nutrition, female-specific sports injuries, exercise and the elderly, structuring a workout, flexibility and strength, clothing and footwear, and proper equipment. Separate chapters examine causes and symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of injuries to the foot; ankle; lower leg; knee; thigh; hip, pelvis, and groin; back; shoulder; elbow; wrist; hand and finger; head and neck; and skin.By following the guidance and guidelines embodied in The Sports Medicine Bible, the recreational athlete can heighten his or her fitness experience, while learning the most modern techniques for effectively managing sports injuries. Written in clear, straightforward language with hundreds of illustrations, The Sports Medicine Bible is destined to become an essential piece of equipment in every athlete's gym bag.",
