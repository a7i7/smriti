Now, in a brilliant literary performance by one of our most compelling and compassionate writers, John Burnham Schwartz reintroduces us to Reservation Road\u2019s unforgettable characters in a superb new work of fiction that stands magnificently on its own. Northwest Corner is a riveting story about the complex, fierce, ultimately inspiring resilience of families in the face of life\u2019s most difficult and unexpected challenges.Twelve years after a tragic accident and a cover-up that led to prison time, Dwight Arno, now fifty, is a man who has started over without exactly moving on. Living alone in California, haunted yet keeping his head down, Dwight manages a sporting goods store and dates a woman to whom he hasn\u2019t revealed the truth about his past. Then an unexpected arrival throws his carefully neutralized life into turmoil and exposes all that he\u2019s hidden.Sam, Dwight\u2019s estranged college-age son, has shown up without warning, fleeing a devastating incident in his own life. In its way, Sam\u2019s sense of guilt is as crushing as his father\u2019s. As the two men are forced to confront their similar natures and their half-buried hopes for connection, they must also search for redemption and love. In turn, they dramatically transform the lives of the women around them: the ex-wives, mothers, and lovers they have turned to in their desperate attempts to somehow rewrite, outrun, or eradicate the past.Told in the resonant voices of everyday people gripped in the emotional riptide of lived life, Northwest Corner is at once tough and heart-lifting, an urgent, powerful story about family bonds that can never be broken and the wayward roads that lead us back to those we love.",

        "Authors": "By Constable, Pamela",
        "Description": "A volatile nation at the heart of major cultural, political, and religious conflicts in the world today, Pakistan commands our attention. Yet more than six decades after the country\u2019s founding as a Muslim democracy, it continues to struggle over its basic identity, alliances, and direction. In Playing with Fire, acclaimed journalist Pamela Constable peels back layers of contradiction and confusion to reveal the true face of modern Pakistan.In this richly reported and movingly written chronicle, Constable takes us on a panoramic tour of contemporary Pakistan, exploring the fears and frustrations, dreams and beliefs, that animate the lives of ordinary citizens in this nuclear-armed nation of 170 million. From the opulent, insular salons of the elite to the brick quarries where soot-covered workers sell their kidneys to get out of debt, this is a haunting portrait of a society riven by inequality and corruption, and increasingly divided by competing versions of Islam.Beneath the fa\u00e7ade of democracy in Pakistan, Constable reveals the formidable hold of its business, bureaucratic, and military elites\u2014including the country\u2019s powerful spy agency, the ISI. This is a society where the majority of the population feels powerless, and radical Islamist groups stoke popular resentment to recruit shock troops for global jihad. Writing with an uncommon ear for the nuances of this conflicted culture, Constable explores the extent to which faith permeates every level of Pakistani society\u2014and the ambivalence many Muslims feel about the role it should play in the life of the nation.Both an empathic and alarming look inside one of the world\u2019s most violent and vexing countries, Playing with Fire is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand modern Pakistan and its momentous role on today\u2019s global stage.",

        "Description": "THE BASIS FOR THE MAJOR MOTION PICTURE ROSEWATER, DIRECTED BY JON STEWARTWhen Maziar Bahari left London in June 2009 to cover Iran\u2019s presidential election, he assured his pregnant fianc\u00e9e, Paola, that he\u2019d be back in just a few days, a week at most. Little did he know, as he kissed her good-bye, that he would spend the next three months in Iran\u2019s most notorious prison, enduring brutal interrogation sessions at the hands of a man he knew only by his smell: Rosewater.For the Bahari family, wars, coups, and revolutions are not distant concepts but intimate realities they have suffered for generations: Maziar\u2019s father was imprisoned by the shah in the 1950s, and his sister by Ayatollah Khomeini in the 1980s. Alone in his cell at Evin Prison, fearing the worst, Maziar draws strength from his memories of the courage of his father and sister in the face of torture, and hears their voices speaking to him across the years. He dreams of being with Paola in London, and imagines all that she and his rambunctious, resilient eighty-four-year-old mother must be doing to campaign for his release. During the worst of his encounters with Rosewater, he silently repeats the names of his loved ones, calling on their strength and love to protect him and praying he will be released in time for the birth of his first child.A riveting, heart-wrenching memoir, Then They Came for Me offers insight into the past seventy years of regime change in Iran, as well as the future of a country where the democratic impulses of the youth continually clash with a government that becomes more totalitarian with each passing day. An intimate and fascinating account of contemporary Iran, it is also the moving and wonderfully written story of one family\u2019s extraordinary courage in the face of repression.Praise for Then They Came for Me\u201cI really connected to Maziar\u2019s story.

        "Description": "The \u201cmaster storyteller\u201d (Publishers Weekly) and bestselling author of Gates of Fire, The Afghan Campaign, and Killing Rommel returns with a stunning, chillingly plausible near-future thriller about the rise of a privately financed and global military industrial complex. The year is 2032. The third Iran-Iraq war is over; the 11/11 dirty bomb attack on the port of Long Beach, California is receding into memory; Saudi Arabia has recently quelled a coup; Russians and Turks are clashing in the Caspian Basin; Iranian armored units, supported by the satellite and drone power of their Chinese allies, have emerged from their enclaves in Tehran and are sweeping south attempting to recapture the resource rich territory that had been stolen from them, in their view, by Lukoil, BP, and ExxonMobil and their privately-funded armies. Everywhere military force is for hire.  Oil companies, multi-national corporations and banks employ powerful, cutting-edge mercenary armies to control global chaos and protect their riches.  Even nation states enlist mercenary forces to suppress internal insurrections, hunt terrorists, and do the black bag jobs necessary to maintain the new New World Order.  Force Insertion is the world's merc monopoly. Its leader is the disgraced former United States Marine General James Salter, stripped of his command by the president for nuclear saber-rattling with the Chinese and banished to the Far East.  A grandmaster military and political strategist, Salter deftly seizes huge oil and gas fields, ultimately making himself the most powerful man in the world.  Salter's endgame is to take vengeance on those responsible for his exile and then come home...as Commander in Chief. The only man who can stop him is the novel's narrator, Gilbert \"Gent\" Gentilhomme, Salter's most loyal foot soldier and as close to him as the son Salter lost. As this action-jammed, lightning fast, and brutally realistic novel builds to its heart-stopping climax Gent launches his personally and professionally most desperate mission: to take out his mentor and save the United States from self destruction. Infused by a staggering breadth of research in military tactics and steeped in the timeless themes of the honor and valor of men at war that distinguish all of Pressfield\u2019s fiction, The Profession is that rare novel that informs and challenges the reader almost as much as it entertains.",

        "Title": "Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America",
        "Authors": "By Coulter, Ann H.",
        "Description": "The demon is a mob, and the mob is demonic. The Democratic Party activates mobs, depends on mobs, coddles mobs, publicizes and celebrates mobs\u2014it is the mob. Sweeping in its scope and relentless in its argument, Demonic explains the peculiarities of liberals as standard groupthink behavior. To understand mobs is to understand liberals.   In her most provocative book to date, Ann Coulter argues that liberals exhibit all the psychological characteristics of a mob, for instance:   Liberal Groupthink: \u201cThe same mob mentality that leads otherwise law-abiding people to hurl rocks at cops also leads otherwise intelligent people to refuse to believe anything they haven\u2019t heard on NPR.\u201d  Liberal Schemes: \u201cNo matter how mad the plan is\u2014Fraternit\u00e9, the \u2018New Soviet Man,\u2019 the Master Race, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, Building a New Society, ObamaCare\u2014a mob will believe it.\u201d  Liberal Enemies: \u201cInstead of \u2018counterrevolutionaries,\u2019 liberals\u2019 opponents are called \u2018haters,\u2019 \u2018those who seek to divide us,\u2019 \u2018tea baggers,\u2019 and \u2018right-wing hate groups.\u2019 Meanwhile, conservatives call liberals \u2018liberals\u2019\u2014and that makes them testy.\u201d  Liberal Justice: \u201cIn the world of the liberal, as in the world of Robespierre, there are no crimes, only criminals.\u201d  Liberal Violence: \u201cIf Charles Manson\u2019s followers hadn\u2019t killed Roman Polanski\u2019s wife, Sharon Tate, Clinton would have pardoned him, too, and he\u2019d probably be teaching at Northwestern University.\u201d   Citing the father of mob psychology, Gustave Le Bon, Coulter catalogs the Left\u2019s mob behaviors: the creation of messiahs, the fear of scientific innovation, the mythmaking, the preference for images over words, the lack of morals, and the casual embrace of contradictory ideas.  Coulter traces the history of the liberal mob to the French Revolution and Robespierre\u2019s revolutionaries (delineating a clear distinction from America\u2019s founding fathers), who simply proclaimed that they were exercising the \u201cgeneral will\u201d before slaughtering their fellow citizens \u201cfor the good of mankind.\u201d  Similarly, as Coulter demonstrates, liberal mobs, from student radicals to white-trash racists to anti-war and pro-ObamaCare fanatics today, have consistently used violence to implement their idea of the \u201cgeneral will.\u201d  This is not the American tradition; it is the tradition of Stalin, of Hitler, of the guillotine\u2014and the tradition of the American Left.  As the heirs of the French Revolution, Democrats have a history that consists of pandering to mobs, time and again, while Republicans, heirs to the American Revolution, have regularly stood for peaceable order.  Hoping to muddy this horrifying truth, liberals slanderously accuse conservatives of their own crimes\u2014assassination plots, conspiracy theorizing, political violence, embrace of the Ku Klux Klan. Coulter shows that the truth is the opposite: Political violence\u2014mob violence\u2014is always a Democratic affair. Surveying two centuries of mob movements, Coulter demonstrates that the mob is always destructive. And yet, she argues, beginning with the civil rights movement in the sixties, Americans have lost their natural, inherited aversion to mobs. Indeed, most Americans have no idea what they are even dealing with.              Only by recognizing the mobs and their demonic nature can America begin to defend itself.",

The slave, Cassius Howard, is a great fictional character, and his story is part mystery, part love story, and a harrowing portrait of slavery that reads with the immense power of the slave narratives. A tour de force for David Fuller.\"--Pat Conroy, author of Beach Music and South of Broad\"With Sweetsmoke, David Fuller gives an extraordinarily nuanced, privileged, and convincing view of the world of slavery during the American Civil War, and of the hearts and minds of the men and women who had to live in that world.\"--Madison Smartt Bell, author of All Souls' Rising and Toussaint LouvertureThe year is 1862, and the Civil War rages through the South. On a Virginia tobacco plantation, another kind of battle soon begins. There, Cassius Howard, a skilled carpenter and slave, risks everything--punishment, sale to a cotton plantation, even his life--to learn the truth concerning the murder of Emoline, a freed black woman, a woman who secretly taught him to read and once saved his life. It is clear that no one cares about her death in the midst of a brutal and hellish war. No one but Cassius, who braves horrific dangers to escape the plantation and avenge her loss.As Cassius seeks answers about Emoline's murder, he finds an unexpected friend and ally in Quashee, a new woman brought over from another plantation; and a formidable adversary in Hoke Howard, the master he has always obeyed.With subtlety and beauty, Sweetsmoke captures the daily indignities and harrowing losses suffered by slaves, the turmoil of a country waging countless wars within its own borders, and the lives of those people fighting for identity, for salvation, and for freedom.",

In Politics Moves Online, Michael Cornfield provides a comprehensive guide to how the Internet has been used in political campaigns. He shows, for example, how candidates such as George Bush and John McCain in 2000&#151;as well as political action committees and the media&#151;struggled to figure out how to fit the Internet into their ongoing operations. Through a series of insightful cases, he examines how candidates use the Web as a campaign tool and as a fund-raising mechanism, and how voters use the Internet to gather information and become more knowledgeable voters. He finds that while many political pundits have argued that the Internet can be a revolutionary force in politics, citizens and politicians alike have yet to find innovative uses that go beyond conventional political operations.",

Memories of his wife, killed two years earlier in a car accident, are vanishing just as his dad predicted they would. Memories he knows he has to remember. His father tells Cameron that to save his mind he must find \"the book with all days in it\" \u2014the past and future record of every soul on earth. When an obscure clue leads Cameron to a small central Oregon town, he meets enigmatic Taylor Stone, a possible guide to finding the book who seems to carry secrets far deeper than anyone imagines.
