What does it mean for a man to be the head of a home? Is divorce ever acceptable? How do we raise children who will love God? What does God have to say about the way we communicate, or about sexual intimacy?Authors Steve and Dee Brestin have wrestled with these questions in their own marriage and have found that God's Word is the only reliable blue-print for marriage and family life. This study will guide you through the encouragement that the Bible gives for those relationships.

A Beautiful Mind traces the meteoric rise of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a prodigy and legend by the age of thirty, who dazzled the mathematical world by solving a series of deep problems deemed \"impossible\" by other mathematicians.But at the height of his fame, Nash suffered a catastrophic mental breakdown and began a harrowing descent into insanity, resigning his post at MIT, slipping into a series of bizarre delusions, and eventually becoming a dreamy, ghostlike figure at Princeton, scrawling numerological messages on blackboards. He was all but forgotten by the outside world -- until, remarkably, he emerged from his madness to win world acclaim. A feat of biographical writing, A Beautiful Mind is also a fascinating look at the extraordinary and fragile nature of genius.",

Days later, the Kennedy clan gathers once again to bury one of its own. This time, though, it isn't the children of Joe and Rose who stand in the spotlight. It is their grandchildren. A Legacy of Joy... If America has a royal family, it is the Kennedys. Their fabled heritage of riches, power and tragedy has forever bound them to our country's history--and its headlines. Now John, Jr.; Caroline; Bobby; Maria; Joe, and their legions of cousins have joined the ranks of those who wield the Kennedy magic over the media and an eager public. And Sorrow >But the story of the third generation of Kennedys extends beyond headlines. How have the children of JFK and Jackie, Bobby and Ethel, Teddy and Joan, coped with their early tragedies and the relentless pressure of public--and family--expectations? How have the children of lesser-known Kennedy branches dealt with their famous last name--or with not being named Kennedy? With remarkable candor, Jay David Andrews chronicles the romances, careers, struggles and achievements of the newest members of this beloved American family--capturing their inescapable legend and undiminished mystique.",

Eden is notorious in Friendly for having eluded a first-degree murder charge some years before, and she is also widely admired for not selling off the family ranch after her grandfather's death. But now Eden is in real troubleDuke Depard, owner of the neighboring two-and-a-half-million-acre Diamond D Ranch, is ruthlessly determined to drive her out of business. Depard is too powerful an enemy for anyone to stand up to alone, and Eden's only family is a ne'er-do-well brother, Vince, whose gambling habits make him unpredictable - and dangerous.Then a stranger drifts into Friendly. Kincade is a soft-spoken, ruggedly handsome man who takes up Eden's cause and becomes her ally against Depard and his band of crooked ranchers. Their union is strictly business, and Eden, who deeply distrusts affairs of the heart, is determined to keep it that way. But Kincade has never felt for another woman the way he feels for Eden. As they struggle together through danger and adversity, Eden realizes the depths of Kincade's devotion, and her reserve gives way to the untapped passions of her heart.",

        "Description": "Bob Kerrey grew up outside Lincoln, Nebraska, in the 1950s, and in his trademark style-serious, sometimes wry-he tells of his journey from that heartland to the dangers of Vietnam, to the hospitals where he recovered from his grievous injuries, and finally to the Nixon White House where he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.   Inspired by the stories of biblical heroes and thrilled by the cowboy serials he saw at the movies on Saturday afternoons, Kerrey grew up in a world as safe and quiet as anywhere you could find on Earth. When he went off to college he knew or cared little about what lay beyond Nebraska, though soon his life would be changed forever. Bob Kerrey comes from a family of soldiers, and so, when the Vietnam draft loomed, he volunteered for the elite Navy SEALS, hoping for adventure and the honor of serving his country. After his arrival in Vietnam, he had to face the brutal reality of the war. In his first firefight, women and children died. His second encounter cost him part of his leg. In his year at the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia, he drew strength from his fellow patients, some more disabled than he, and he learned to walk again. But he had turned against the war and could no longer find solace in his religion.   A quest begins and ends this book. When his father was dying, he asked Kerrey to find out how his Uncle John had really died in World War II. It is this quest that inspires Bob Kerrey as he narrates his own personal odyssey in this remarkable and powerful book.",

Bush since, as she says, \"the motorcade was only one car and he was sometimes the one driving it.\" As counselor to the president, she brought the working mom's perspective to the White House, often asking of President Bush's policies, \"What does this mean for the average person?\"Yet the move from Texas to Washington was hard on her family, and in a controversial, headline-making decision that reverberated across America, she summoned the courage to say, \"Mr. President, I love you, but I need to move my family home to Texas.\" There, Hughes continues to advise the president, where the kitchen wall calendar marks the State of the Union message side by side with her son's orthodontist appointments.Reading Ten Minutes from Normal - the title comes from the campaign trail - one is instantly absorbed in what it's like to be a \"normal\" person who goes to work at the White House as part of the president's inner circle. Told in Karen Hughes's down-to-earth, warm, often funny, and frank voice, the book is a blend of an ordinary woman's life, with all its compromises and everyday decisions, and an insightful look at American politics and America's forty-third president.",

With candour, wit and embarrassing naivete, Help Wanted, Desperately, a hilarious first novel by a recent college grad, ultimately touches on what it means to have potential \u2013\u2013 and how we find happiness in who we are, not what we do. Alexa Hoffman never expected to fondle crotchless panties in the middle of an interview. And under no circumstances did she ever anticipate that in her quest for a job in New York City, she would ultimately try to become an earthworm breeder, a phone sex operator, and a deodorant sniffer all over the course of one week. Desperate to avoid moving back in with her parents, Alexa haphazardly signs up to become an English teacher for $100 a month on the third world island of Majuro, though she has no real interest in actually working there. Eager to move to New York City and avoid Majuro at all costs, Alexa makes a vow: it's Majuro or Bust and she's got only seven months and three weeks to find and secure a job in New York City.  As the clock furiously ticks closer to her imminent trip to Majuro and Alexa's desperate search for employment grows increasingly more bizarre, Alexa finds herself falling deeper in love with her boyfriend Jared, and deeper into an endlessly disastrous situation that forces her maniacal job search into new and uncharted waters, murky with possibility, love, and the confusion born from missed opportunities.",

Stiglitz showed how a misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to many of the recent problems suffered by the developing nations. Here he turns the same light on the United States. This groundbreaking work by the Nobel Prize-winning economist argues that much of what we understood about the 1990s' prosperity is wrong, that the theories that have been used to guide world leaders and anchor key business decisions were fundamentally outdated. Yes, jobs were created, technology prospered, inflation fell, and poverty was reduced. But at the same time the foundation was laid for the economic problems we face today. Trapped in a near-ideological commitment to free markets, policymakers permitted accounting standards to slip, carried deregulation further than they should have, and pandered to corporate greed. These chickens have now come home to roost.",

        "Description": "Since the publication of Harvey Penick's Little Red Book, the world has almost literally beaten a path to Harvey Penick's door. Hardly a day goes by without a stranger arriving at the Penick home, book in hand, hoping for more pearls of wisdom, an autograph, or just wanting to say, \"Thank you.\"  Bud Shrake, Penick's coauthor, noticed that Penick usually inscribes the books, \"To my friend and pupil.\" How could he do that, Shrake asked him, when he didn't know these people?  \"Well,\" replied Penick, \"if you read my book you're my pupil, and if you play golf, you're my friend.\"  And If You Play Golf, You're My Friend picks up where the Little Red Book left off. It features the same blend of simple wisdom, sound golfing instruction, and good common sense that has made the Little Red Book so popular with golfers of all ages and levels of ability. And, as in the previous volume, Penick's deep love for the game and his delight in teaching shine through on every page.  Penick tells the story of his son-in-law's first golf lesson, a story with a twist right out of O. Henry. He relates the tale of a player from Houston who had only one flaw in his game -- that his scores were too high -- and who exploded with anger when Penick told him so. He gives advice to parents on how to help their children learn golf, shows how to overcome a slice by \"playing baseball,\" and shares the pride and joy he felt while watching his pupil Tom Kite win the U.S. Open.  Warm, witty, and wise, And If You Play Golf, You're My Friend shows why Harvey Penick has become America's best-loved teacher of the great game of golf.",

Midge Decter, an accomplished political journalist who has enjoyed over two decades of friendship with Rumsfeld, will answer the question of why and how he has come to play such a critical role. Partly biographical and partly analytical, the book focuses on Rumsfeld's past and current activities as well as what he represents: an ethos of sturdiness, frankness, and resilience that has clearly resonated with the American public. Decter gained Rumsfeld's full cooperation, and she trailed him through the Pentagon and beyond as he prosecuted the war on terror and the military campaign against Saddam Hussein. The daily stresses of advising the president, handling the media, crafting military policy, and dealing with issues of life and death are examined from the inside \u2013 as they happened. This book offers a dynamic, intimate, behind\u2013the\u2013scenes look at the biggest political star (apart from the President himself) of the Bush administration.",

Rob Mundle takes readers through every white-knuckling hour of the gale that descended in the predawn hours of December 27, stretching over 900 miles from Australia to New Zealand, bringing with it hurricane strength winds and five-story waves. In all, 57 sailors were rescued, plucked from the decks of broken boats or from the sea itself under impossible conditions. Six sailors died. A Sydney-Hobart Race veteran himself, Rob Mundle had total and unequaled access to the people behind the story. The result is a tale of extreme adventure, extraordinary will, and the overwhelming emotional tales of survivors, rescuers, and the bereaved.",

Sylvie has everything, it seems, but what she wants most: passion and romance -- moonlit cruises, holding hands, gazing at the stars. \"When you&#39;re married,\" Sylvie sighs, \"you don&#39;t even get kissed on the mouth.\"With building the business, raising the babies and creating their home, she and Bob hadn&#39;t found much time to focus on love. But now that the twins are off to college and the business is blooming, Sylvie is sure they will make their marriage bloom. So she believes until one day she does the laundry and notices those incriminating credit card receipts. Her husband has found romance, but it isn&#39;t with her.Bob is having an affair.Shocked and enraged, Sylvie fantasizes about a bullet to the leg (just to make Bob lame) -- followed by a hefty settlement. Her mother begs her to calm down: Her marriage is worth saving.  Sylvie&#39;s having none of that. Out for blood, she sets off to confront Marla, the other woman. What she finds, however, is not what she expects.  Looking at Marla is like gazing back in time: Except for 10 years and 15 pounds, Marla could be her twin. Marla has the best of Bob&#39;s love -- flowers, hot sex, breathy phone calls, candlelit dinner -- yet she admits to Sylvie that she lacks the thing she wants most: a husband and home of her own. \"When you&#39;re single,\" Marla sighs, \"you have to smell good 24 hours a day.\"Going beyond revenge, Sylvie hatches a brilliant scheme to make them both winners and bring Bob to his knees. But will they end up with what they want or walk away empty-handed and broken-hearted?No one defines modern love, work and sexual warfare better than New York Times\u00a0 bestselling author Olivia Goldsmith. In her most surprisingly ingenious novel yet, she once again speaks as the voice for her gender when she points out a truth not universally acknowledged until now: All wives yearn for the romance of being a mistress and all mistresses yearn for the security of being a wife.",

Scholarship opportunities pulled him out of the black world where he had grown up into a world largely defined by whites. Meanwhile, as the industries that supported his hometown failed, and drug dealing rushed in to fill the economic void, news of arrests and premature deaths among Brent's childhood friends underscored his precarious perch in a mostly white environment. The death of his younger brother -- a cocaine dealer murdered by one of his \"clients\" -- propelled Brent into a reconsideration of his childhood that offers vivid portraits of family values that supported, pressures that tore apart, and the appeal and pain of living as an adult in a world that was literally and figuratively miles away from the one he knew as a child.",

Strong, healthy families are built on strong, supportive foundations - and, as in all durable institutions, that foundation must include a legal system, an economic system, and a set of unifying traditions.Linda and Richard Eyre show you how to build a simple family infrastructure of rules, shared responsibilities, and fun traditions. This foundation works for you - teaching and reinforcing such family values as sharing, honesty, and self-reliance.3 Steps to a Strong Family offers a simple three-step program that involves children in every important family activity - from discipline to finances to family traditions - in age-appropriate ways. Your children will learn valuable lessons that will benefit them for the rest of their lives, every family member will face less stress, and you will have more time to spend with and enjoy each other.Full of examples, family activities, and commonsense advice drawn from Linda and Richard Eyre's child-rearing experience, 3 Steps to a Strong Family also includes comments from all nine of the Eyre's children - adding a valuable child's-eye view on what makes a happy family. Your whole family will benefit from the Eyres' positive, effective methods of working together toward common family goals.Linda and Richard Eyre are the leading spokespersons for the most important phenomenon sweeping America today - the return and recommitment to family life and family values.Born into modest circumstances in Baltimore, Richard was raised from his teens by his widowed mother. Linda grew up with two working parents. As parents, they're in the process of raising nine children, facing such challenges as hyperactivity, difficult teenagers, learning disabilities, and depression along the way.",

Desperate to shed his blue-collar lineaments, Patrick inevitably is entranced by Will's wealthy, deeply and eccentrically Southern family; he soon becomes both a student of its origins in antebellum Mississippi and an awkward participant in its legacy. While Will throws himself headlong into the spirit of the age - achieving his apotheosis as a notorious music mogul - Patrick hews to the course prescribed by his adopted class, through Yale (a Savage tradition) and Harvard Law.But as they pursue their wildly distinct ambitions, the world remakes itself around them - Aquarius collapsing in paroxysms of assassination and rage - and their trust turns tentative and conflicted even as the allure of their prospects darkens. Will's relentless provocations culminate in his sudden marriage to a black woman, whereas for a long time Patrick refuses to risk a private life beyond his role as mediator and confidante.Still, neither man proves capable of facing his ordeals alone. And only decades later, with each ensconced in some version of the future he once dreamed of, is the nature and meaning of this friendship truly understood - the procession of favor and compromise, differences verging on antagonism and similarities no less surprising, yet more enduring.",
