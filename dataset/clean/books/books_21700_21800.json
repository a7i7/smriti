Then his youngest child, straight out of high school, joined the U.S. Marine Corps. Written in alternating voices by eighteen-year-old John and his father, Frank, Keeping Faith takes readers in riveting fashion through a family\u2019s experience of the U.S. Marine Corps. From being broken down and built back up on Parris Island (and being the parent of a child undergoing that experience), to the growth of both father and son and their separate reevaluations of what it means to serve. From Frank\u2019s realization that among his fellow soccer dads \u201cthe very words \u2018boot camp\u2019 were pejorative, conjuring up \u2018troubled youths at risk\u2019 \u201c to John\u2019s learning that \u201cthe Marine next to you is more important than you are,\u201d Keeping Faith is a fascinating and personal reconsideration of issues of class, duty, and patriotism. But as John and his fellow recruits battle to make the cut\u2014and John\u2019s family struggles to deal with the worry and separation, it is also an extremely timely, moving, and wonderfully written human interest story\u2014a moving chronicle of love, duty and patriotism in contemporary America. \u201cBeautifully written ... great insight and unselfconscious humor.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly",

Written for the 23 million Americans struggling with alcohol and drugs, it is \u201ca clear, accurate, and comprehensive resource\u2014for patients, their families, and helping professionals\u201d (Anthony B. Radcliffe, M.D., former president, American Society of Addiction Medicine).  Dr. Al Mooney, who lectures internationally on recovery, writing with medical and health journalists Howard Eisenberg and Catherine Dold, covers all the latest in addiction science and recovery techniques. Extensive research in neuroplasticity, for example, sheds new light on how alcohol and drugs actually alter pathways in the brain\u2014but also how this same process, when trained in recovery, can remold the brain, making sobriety a routine way of life. A new understanding of gender and addiction leads to revised insights, techniques, and new hope for treating women in recovery. The book also covers the latest problems and treatments for prescription drugs (now more pernicious than illegal drugs); up-to-date models for intervention; and more.  But what really sets the book apart is its question-and-answer format\u2014\u201cMy wife wants me to go to AA, and I think that\u2019s ridiculous. How can I settle this argument?\u201d \u201cI take a few oxycodone pills each week. They\u2019re prescription, so they must be safe, right?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been in this treatment center for nearly a week. I feel great. I\u2019m cured. Why can\u2019t I leave now?\u201d That simple, direct approach makes the daunting journey to sobriety doable.",

As a survivor of the Holocaust and a life-long proponent of free expression, Soros understands the meaning of freedom. And yet his differences with George Bush, another proponent of freedom, are  profound.  In this powerful essay Soros spells out his views and how they differ from the president's. He reflects on why the Democrats may have lost the high ground on these values issues and how they might reclaim it. As he has in his recent books, On Globalization and The Bubble of  American Supremacy, Soros uses facts, anecdotes, personal experience and philosophy to illuminate a major topic in a way that both enlightens and inspires.",

On the ocean floor lie over a century and a half of subs, lost both in war and in peace. Now, for the first time, the individual stories of these sunken ships are woven together to create an amazing history of underwater warfare and exploration-and the price that hundreds of subs and thousands of sailors have paid. In gripping text and powerful images (including state-of-the-art contemporary underwater photographs), Lost Subs chronicles the fate of some of the most famous subs in naval history-from the sinking of the Confederate Army's sub Hunley to the recent loss of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk. With a wealth of archival material, modern and period photographs, and stunning paintings by renowned Titanic artist Ken Marschall, this definitive illustrated history brings to life the museum of submarines resting in their underwater graves and the submariners on \"eternal patrol.\" And it vividly re-creates the missions to explore and raise many famous sunken subs, including the Hunley and the Kursk-missions sometimes as fraught with peril as any wartime duty. Filled with mystery, drama, and daring, and as current as today's headlines, Lost Subs is a powerful, true thriller.",

        "Description": "Why do Americans care so much about the Founding Fathers? After all, the French don't ask themselves, \"What would Napoleon do?\" But Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, and Adams built our country, wrote our user's manuals--the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution--and ran the nation while it was still under warranty and could be returned to the manufacturer. If anyone knows how the U.S.A. should work, they did and they still do. Richard Brookhiser has been writing, talking, and thinking about the Founders for years. Now he channels them. What would Hamilton think about free trade? What would Franklin make of the national obsession with values? What would Washington say about gays in the military? Examining a host of issues from terrorism to women's rights to gun control, Brookhiser reveals why we still turn to the Founders in moments of struggle, farce, or disaster--just as Lincoln, FDR, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Bill Clinton have done before us. Written with Brookhiser's trademark eloquence--and a good dose of wit--while drawing on his deep knowledge of American history, What Would the Founders Do? sheds new light on the disagreements and debates that have shaped our country from the beginning. Brookhiser challenges us to think and act with the clarity that the Founders brought to the task of making a democratic country. Now, more than ever, we need these creators of America--argumentative, expansive, funny know-it-alls--to help us solve the issues that threaten to divide us.",

        "Description": "A deep and widespread crisis affects modern economic theory, a crisis that derives from the absence of a \"vision\"--a set of widely shared political and social preconceptions--on which all economics ultimately depends.  This absence, in turn, reflects the collapse of the Keynesian view that provided such a foundation from 1940 through the early 1970s, comparable to earlier visions provided by Smith, Ricardo, Mill, and Marshall. The \"unraveling\" of Keynesianism has been followed by a division into discordant and ineffective camps whose common denominator seems to be their shared analytical refinement and lack of practical applicability.  This provocative analysis attempts both to describe this state of affairs, and to suggest the direction in which economic thinking must move if it is to regain the relevance and remedial power it now pointedly lacks.",

        "Description": "This timely volume explores the psychological aspects of cyberspace, a virtual world in which people from around the globe are acting and interacting in many new, unusual, and occasionally alarming ways. Drawing on research in the social sciences, communications, business, and other fields, Patricia Wallace examines how the online environment can influence the way we behave, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. Our own online behavior then becomes part of the Internet's psychological environment for others, creating opportunities for shaping the way this new territory for human interaction is unfolding. Since the Internet--and our experience within it--is still young, we have a rare window of opportunity to influence the course of its development. With a new preface that incorporates many of the changes online and in the field since the hardcover edition was published, the paperback edition of The Psychology of the Internet includes the latest coverage of e-commerce, workplace surveillance and datamining, all areas of recent intense public concern.    Patricia M. Wallace is Executive Director of the Center for Knowledge and Information Management at the Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland. She is author of an interactive psychology CD-ROM called PRISM and of the textbook Introduction to Psychology, Fourth Edition (with Jeffrey Goldstein). Dr. Wallace is also the principal investigator on grants from the Annenberg Projects/Corporation for Public Broadcasting dealing with language learning through CD-ROMs and the Internet.",

The true hero is simply someone who makes a difference-large or small-in the lives of others. They battle disease, crime, poverty and human rights violations. They clean up environments, mentor neglected children and truly care about others. Most importantly, anyone can be a hero in the eyes of another.In Chicken Soup for the Soul of America, everyday heroes are celebrated. Heroes have always been in our midst, but the recent terrorist attacks on American soil have revealed many more heroes who have given their lives, love, time and strength to those in great need. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 events, Americans have found courage and inspiration from so many heroes, and this book pays tribute to them all, as well as those who appear every day in our lives.At a time when so many are in pain, these unique stories will touch readers with love and wisdom, the cornerstones of the American people and the hallmark of the well-loved Chicken Soup series.",

        "Authors": "By Pearson, Ridley",
        "Description": "Seattle police psychologist Daphne Mathews has her hands full with a pregnant, addicted, runaway teenager, a murder victim's brother whose strange behavior unnerves her, and a deputy sheriff she once treated who's now stalking her. She's frightened enough to move in with Detective John LaMoia, a development that doesn't exactly thrill Lou Boldt, their boss and Daphne'sex-lover. But Lou's too busy with his own cases to brood over John and Daphne: the recent disappearances of two local women, and the death of Billy Chen, the nephew of Mama Lu, an old friend and a powerful figure in Seattle's Chinese community, which appeared to be an accident but turns out to have been murder.The only thing the disappearances and murder have in common is location; all three victims were last seen in a part of downtown built over the Underground, a dark and dangerous warren of buildings abandoned after the fire that leveled Seattle more than a hundred years ago.While Seattle's Underground has been the setting for several mysteries by other authors (Earl Emerson, J.A. Jance), Pearson makes the most of its creepy-crawly atmosphere in a gripping thriller whose solid plotting pulls all of Daphne's, LaMoia's, and Boldt's cases together. It also wisely reconfigures the personal relationships among the three central characters, which bodes well for their future adventures in this long-running series (Middle ofNowhere, The Pied Piper). --Jane Adams",

The result of his odyssey is Fraternity.Rich with the sounds of the presidents\u2019 own voices, Fraternity is dramatic, surprising, funny, revealing, inspiring, tragic, touching and unforgettable: a story destined to be read and enjoyed not just now, but far into the future as Americans think about who we are as a people.Here is Nixon, in an unmarked office high above Manhattan, explaining the reason for his solitary walks through New York streets at 5:30 every morning. Here is Carter, riding in a Secret Service van, recalling the sting of his family\u2019s being mocked for their rural Southern heritage, even after he had won the White House. Here is Ford, beside a golf course fairway, laughing at his startled discovery that of all his presidential papers, the one worth the most on the open market was a letter from a woman who tried to kill him. Here is Bush, on the road with his son, remembering his despair and anger at encountering a swastika carved into the sand behind an elegant resort on American soil. And here is Nancy Reagan, in a Beverly Hills hotel, on the haunting first night she must stand in for her husband after the announcement of his illness.A travelogue of the national spirit that chronicles a quest stretching over fifteen years and starring the biggest names in the modern American saga, this is living history of the most human kind, and Bob Greene at his very best.",

Always reliable and now re-designed to be even more accessible, weekly chapters include illustrations, descriptions of baby's growth and developmental milestones, information about a mother's average weight gain and what she might be feeling or becoming aware of, and the medical testing that corresponds to the week in question. New features include:* Information on cutting edge obstetric technologies-from 3D ultrasound to pre-natal genetic testing* The very latest diet, nutritional and fitness recommendations for expectant mothers* A new chapter devoted to overdue (post-term) pregnancies* An expanded 15-page glossary of pregnancy and childbirth terms* A handy Due Date Prediction Calendar",

        "Description": "Developed by weight-loss experts Drs. James O. Hill and John C. Peters, co-founders of America on the Move\u2122, The Step Diet Book is a motivational walking program that will help millions of overweight Americans lose weight and keep it off forever.Combining a book and pedometer--in itself a $20 value--plus conversion charts and dozens of fat-burning Step Recipes, this is a complete package. At its core is a simple concept called energy balance. Calories come in, calories go out--and when intake is greater than output, you gain weight. The Step Diet Book attacks the problem from both ends. First, use the pedometer to figure out how many steps you take in an average day, then raise the number by 2,000--it's as easy as pacing while talking on the phone, or parking at the far end of the lot. Second, eat one-quarter less of your food--which counteracts our tendency to supersize meals. Once balance is achieved, get fit and lose weight by adding more steps to your day. You can even enjoy a guilt-free lapse by knowing exactly how many steps to tack on at the end of your day.",

        "Authors": "By Smith, Robin L.",
        "Description": "Psychologist Dr. Robin Smith reveals how to turn vows made at the altar into realistic plans for a long and happy marriage. Dr. Robin Smith advises couples on how to take the wedding vows that were made in earnest and in innocence, to a level where they can be used to build a happy, healthy, satisfying and long-lasting marriage. Lies at the Altar is for couples who are planning marriage, are newly married, or who have been married for years. In Lies at the Altar: The Truth About Great Marriages, Dr. Robin Smith addresses the unspoken needs, unasked questions, outrageous expectations, and hidden agendas that often linger beneath the surface of the wedding vows and appear later to cause power struggles, suffering, and feelings of hopelessness in marriages. Dr. Smith discusses why it's important to have one's \"eyes wide open\" in a marriage; how to write true vows to live by; and why it's never too late to rewrite your vows. She illustrates her advice with detailed stories from her own life, as well as from couples that she has counseled. And in her inspiring conclusion, she invites couples to light up their lives by acknowledging each other as individuals, each of whom lights a candle, and who lights a third candle which represents \"us\". Calling \"truth\" the secret ingredient of great marriages, Dr. Smith teaches individuals and couples how to find the truth within themselves and their partners, whether they are heading to the altar, suffering in an unhappy marriage, divorced, or simply want to bring more satisfaction and intimacy into their relationship.",
