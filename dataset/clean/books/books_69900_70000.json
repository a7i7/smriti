        "Description": "Anyone who watches the television news has seen images of firefighters rescuing people from burning buildings and paramedics treating bombing victims. How do these individuals make the split-second decisions that save lives? Most studies of decision making, based on artificial tasks assigned in laboratory settings, view people as biased and unskilled. Gary Klein is one of the developers of the naturalistic decision making approach, which views people as inherently skilled and experienced. It documents human strengths and capabilities that so far have been downplayed or ignored.Since 1985, Klein has conducted fieldwork to find out how people tackle challenges in difficult, nonroutine situations.  Sources of Power is based on observations of humans acting under such real-life constraints as time pressure, high stakes, personal responsibility, and shifting conditions. The professionals studied include firefighters, critical care nurses, pilots, nuclear power plant operators, battle planners, and chess masters. Each chapter builds on key incidents and examples to make the description of the methodology and phenomena more vivid. In addition to providing information that can be used by professionals in management, psychology, engineering, and other fields, the book presents an overview of the research approach of naturalistic decision making and expands our knowledge of the strengths people bring to difficult tasks.",

In contrast, The Watsons is a delightful fragment, whose spirited heroine -\u00ad Emma -\u00ad finds her marriage opportunities limited by poverty and pride. Meanwhile Sanditon, set in a seaside resort, offers a glorious cast of hypochondriacs and spectators, treated by Austen with both amusement and scepticism.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

He finds routine convoy escort duties end abruptly when Admiral Nelson, pursuing the French fleet to Egypt, sends Hellebore to the Red Sea with an urgent warning to the British squadron there. However, Nelson\u2019s apprehensions over French ambitions in the East are more than justified. Edouard Santhonax, Drinkwater\u2019s old enemy, is already preparing for a French descent on India. The hunt for this elusive Frenchman and his frigate is combined with British naval operations on the flank of Napoleon\u2019s Egyptian campaign. It is during the attack on Kosseir that Drinkwater is left for dead. His escape and the subsequent desperate attack on Santhonax leads to a still more dangerous situation under Augustus Morris, former tyrant of the midshipmen\u2019s berth on HMS Cyclops.Drinkwater\u2019s fight to bring a half-armed ship safely to the cape of Good Hope is beset with personal enmity, the activity of the French and the violence of the sea.",

How does the media enable one person to have an effect and mobilize people? Are there other examples of people like Doris? 2. How can we use Doris\u2019s model of taking advantage of own strengths\u2013whatever they may be\u2013to achieve a goal? 3. Before she begins her trip, Doris declares, \u201cI like to compete, even if it is against people\u2019s expectations, and I do not favor losing.\u201d How does her competitive nature present itself in the book? 4. How does Doris Haddock fit into the American Progressive Era and populist tradition? Who else in the American spotlight of past or present do you feel evokes the ideals behind this movement? 5. Discuss Doris\u2019s feelings about the importance of family, friends, and community. How do these things play into her ideal regarding the American political structure? 6. How do Doris\u2019s memories function in the text? Would you categorize GRANNY D as a memoir or a political tract or both? 7. Consider the changes in women\u2019s lives that have taken place during Doris\u2019s time (Doris was kicked out of Emerson College for getting married, but her daughter went on to graduate from Smith. Doris comments later in the book that it\u2019s \u201cwonderful to see so many women highly placed in news organizations\u2026Women reporters\u2026have been around since before my time. But now they are running newspapers.\u201d). Do you consider Doris to be a strong female role model? Why or why not? Doris states that being \u201cyoung and attractive [is] the essence of being female in this culture.\u201d Is this a positive or negative statement? 8. Doris often relied on strangers during her walk, and in many ways, GRANNY D is a catalogue of the names of people whom she met along her way; how does this inclusion of regular people in the storyline contribute to her point regarding campaign finance reform? 9. How does Doris\u2019s method of directly addressing the reader in the second person affect the book\u2019s tone? Does this also contribute to her message about democracy and politics? 10. Doris contends that the reason behind the dissolution of family strength is that \u201cIn today\u2019s world, millions of laboring parents no longer have the ability to meet their responsibilities to their families, and everything falls down without that centerpost.\u201d Do you agree or disagree with this argument? 11. Discuss Doris\u2019s insight into relations between people of different origins and backgrounds when she walks with Golam Mohammed and remembers her mother\u2019s feelings towards the German family in town during World War I. 12. How does Doris\u2019s experience working with Ida Thomas and later for Mrs. P inform her perspective? 13. Revisit Doris\u2019s speech at the Lorriane Motel on September 7, 1999 and discuss her connection to Martin Luther King and her comparison of campaign finance reform to the civil rights struggle.",

Known within her family for being an aimless, impulsive trouble-magnet, Lily finally decides she may as well live up to her reputation: she elopes with new beau and would-be rock star Ted Dayton. But just as quickly as his band skyrockets, Lily's marriage crashes and burns. When news of her ex's new love with sultry and silicone-enhanced actress Melanie Slate hits the tabloids, she flees the country.   Hello, London!   Across the pond, Lily shares a flat with an old flame -- a commitment-phobic doctor who convinces her that the best prescription for her broken heart is volunteering at the local hospital. Turns out, he's right, as one of the patients, famed soccer star Sean Gates, takes more than a passing interest in Lily's quirky style. But things get complicated when her ex's band starts flying up the British charts. Ted comes to town, the paparazzi camp on her doorstep, and her new fling and old flame both find rumors that Lily and her ex are planning a little reunion tour rather troublesome. Is there a happily ever after at the end of this rocky road?",
