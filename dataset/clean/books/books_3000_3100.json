        "Authors": "By Restak, Richard, M.D.",
        "Description": "Are you bombarded by a constant media feed of global terrorism, war, and rising unemployment rates\u2014and by a mind-numbing array of ads that urge you to \u201cask your doctor\u201d about the newest anti-anxiety medications? If it sometimes feels as if this country is having a collective anxiety attack, then you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that more than 19 million Americans suffer from some form of acute anxiety.Poe\u2019s Heart and the Mountain Climber tackles this situation head-on, with a fresh perspective and a straightforward approach to exploring and understanding our anxiety before it paralyzes us.After interviewing many experts on anxiety, and reflecting on his own many years treating anxious patients (as well as experiencing more than a few anxious moments himself), Dr. Richard Restak has organized this book around one primary principal: the best way to manage anxiety in these anxious times is to learn about it and put that learning to practical use. His message is vital and empowering: anxiety is not a mental illness that must require medication, but often a normal, biological response to stress.Anxiety is part of our genetic makeup. We wouldn\u2019t be alive today if our ancestors had lacked the ability to anticipate dangers and threats. Anxiety is as natural a part of our existence as breathing, eating, or sleeping, and it is closely linked to our powers of reasoning. Unlike any other species, only we are able to envision future possibilities. As a result, we aren\u2019t tethered to the here and now, but can imaginatively anticipate the good things that might happen to us. But we can also envision the bad things and, as a result, experience anxiety. We can\u2019t have one without the other. Anxiety, therefore, isn\u2019t something to be eliminated but, rather, something to be understood. Anxiety is only undesirable when it becomes extreme.This groundbreaking book teaches us to view anxiety not as a burden, but as a stimulus for greater accomplishment and enhanced self-knowledge. We will function at our best when we stop working to deny our anxiety or trying to escape it and instead learn to accept its presence in our lives and transform it into the positive, creative energy from which it stems.",

        "Description": "There are some things people think but don't say....  \"Political correctness is the classic Great Idea Gone Wrong. All it's done is shut us up. It hasn't changed anybody's mind. It hasn't changed our hearts. It's changed our faces. It's taken every opinion we have, it's taken every joke we have, and it's forced us to conceal it and hide it and bury it. It's made us superficial.\"  \"Terrorism isn't caused by poverty, poverty is caused by terrorism. Terror is a tool used by those seeking power to keep the masses in need of an answer.\"  \"Too many people blame everything on everybody else, and because they do, they will expect too little from themselves and too little from their children.\" Glenn Beck says all that, and more.  As one of the most listened to nationally syndicated radio talk-show hosts and the driving force behind the Rallies for America, Glenn Beck entertains, inspires, and informs millions of listeners. In The Real America, Beck continues to tell it like it really is, cutting through the fog of modern-day pundits and pontificators who have made it their mission to undermine and underestimate the greatness of America, our strength as Americans, and the power of the American spirit.  With his inimitable combination of self-effacing humor and heartfelt conviction, Glenn rails against many of the forces that keep us from our potential as a nation and as individuals -- and tells how to overcome them. His topics include:   Family and community  Politics  Personal responsibility  Race relations  Religion  Political correctness, the media, Hollywood, and celebrities  Abortion and the deat penalty  Alcohol and drugs  Why I wave the flag  Glenn Beck's compelling message in The Real America echoes the ideas he has delivered to thousands of people with his groundbreaking Rallies for America: Once we connect with our power individually, we can empower others -- and then we can be as great and as grand as we have always wanted to be as a person, as a people, and as a nation.",

Though Juno cringes at the inevitable talk of the pregnancy that kept her from graduating, and of her husband, Neil Buchwald, who ended up in a mental hospital only two years after their wedding, Juno endures the gossip for her friend\u2019s sake. Christine\u2019s lecture sends shockwaves through the rapt crowd when she reveals little-known details about the lives of two sisters, Eugenie and Clare\u2014members of the powerful and influential family whose name the college bears. Christine\u2019s revelation throws shadows of betrayal, lust, and insanity onto the family\u2019s distinguished facade.But after the lecture, Christine seems distant, uneasy, and sad. The next day, she disappears. Juno immediately suspects a connection to her friend\u2019s shocking speech. Although painfully reminded of her own experience with Neil\u2019s mental illness, Juno nevertheless peels away the layers of secrets and madness that surround the Penrose dynasty. She fears that Christine discovered something damning about them, perhaps even something worth killing for. And Juno is determined to find it\u2014for herself, for her friend, and for her long-lost husband.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Title": "Sacred Passage: How to Provide Fearless, Compassionate Care for the Dying",
        "Authors": "By Coberly, Margaret, Ph.D.",
        "Description": "Working as an emergency room nurse, Margaret Coberly came in contact with death on a daily basis. However, it wasn't until her own brother was diagnosed with terminal cancer that she realized she understood very little about the emotional and spiritual aspects of caring for the terminally ill. To fill this gap she turned to the unique wisdom on death and dying found in Tibetan Buddhism. In this book Coberly offers sound, practical advice on meeting the essential needs of the dying, integrating stories from her long career in nursing with useful insights from the Tibetan Buddhist teachings. In the West, death is viewed as a tragic and horrible event. Coberly shows us how this view generates fear and denial, which harm the dying by adding unnecessary loneliness, confusion, and mental anguish to the dying process. Tibetan Buddhism focuses on the nature of death and how to face it with honesty, openness, and courage. In this view, death is not a failure, but a natural part of life that, if properly understood and appreciated, can offer the dying and their loved ones an opportunity to gain valuable insight and wisdom. Coberly argues that the Tibetan Buddhist outlook can be a useful antidote to the culture of fear and denial that surrounds death in the West and can help caregivers become more fully present, fearless, honest, and compassionate. Sacred Passage  highlights two very practical teachings on death and dying from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and presents them in clear, nontechnical language. Readers learn about the \"eight stages of dissolution leading to death,\" a detailed roadmap of the dying process that describes the sequence of physical, psychological, and spiritual changes that occur as we die. Coberly also presents the \"death meditation,\" a contemplative exercise for developing a new relationship to death\u2014and life. The book also includes a lengthy, annotated list of recommended readings for added guidance and inspiration. Topics include:   How the terminally ill can experience emotional and spiritual healing even when they can't be cured  Why Western medicine's relentless focus on curing disease has led to inadequate care for the dying  What to expect during the dying process  How our fear and denial of death harm the dying  Techniques to help caregivers promote a peaceful environment for the dying and their loved ones  How to meet the changing physical and emotional needs of the dying  Helpful advice on what to say and how to behave around the terminally ill",

        "Authors": "By Freeman, Michael (PHT), Rocheleau, Paul (PHT), Larkin, David, Garrett, Wendell, and Webb, Michael",
        "Description": "Nowhere else in the world can compare with the incredible array of domestic architecture in America. It sometimes seems that there are as many styles of houses as there are actual number of houses. While the earliest American houses were largely derived from English or Dutch prototypes, the diversity for which America is so celebrated soon emerged, reflecting mostly how Americans used their homes, as well as local and regional tastes and vernacular and folk origins from around the world. The variety and dynamism in the style of homes in that emerging pluralistic society marches on today in homes designed by adventuresome architects and clients.In this extraordinary celebration of the American house, renowned author David Larkin, with commentary by some of today's leading architectural historians and critics, examines the paths that have led to distinctively American homes. Special attention is given to examining details of the makeup of each house as well as the functions of \"the home\" and how these functions have changed just as technology, social relations, and living arrangements have changed in the United States over the past 400 years.Filled with more than 400 beautiful color photographs, this book also contains six double gatefolds, which offer dramatic presentations of the elements and details that make up the variety of architectural styles in American residential architecture. No other illustrated history of the American house can come close to this full portrayal of the historical and stylistic ranges of the place we call \"home.\"",

In minutes he was at Ground Zero of the worst terrorist attack on American soil, as the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center began to burn-and then to buckle. A veteran of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, Picciotto was eerily familiar with the inside of the North Tower. And it was there that he concentrated his rescue efforts. It was in its smoky stairwells where he heard and felt the South Tower collapse. Where he made the call for firemen and rescue workers to evacuate, while he stayed behind with a skeleton team of men to help evacuate a group of disabled and infirm civilians. And it was in the rubble of the North Tower where Picciotto found himself buried-for more than four hours after the building's collapse.  This is the harrowing true story of a true American hero, a man who thought nothing of himself-and gave nearly everything for others during one of New York City's-and the country's-darkest hours.",

It becomes a living phenomenon with human qualities: \"honest water\"; \"strong water\"; a landscape that has \"diminished and forgiven him.\"  He writes sometimes in melancholy about human affairs: \"a common durable sadness,\" \"a language of loss, of everything unassuaged,\" \"a thousand discouragements,\" \"the underwater light/that comes before a storm.\"  And often of quiet memory, \"imagination's tender lens,\" and of anticipation, \"the love your empty dress is promising.\"  Honest Water is a book of steadily evolving power.",

        "Description": "For the first time ever, Sex in America reveals the myth-shattering results of the only comprehensive and methodologically sound survey of America's sexual practices and beliefs.In 1992, highly regarded social scientists Robert T. Michael, John H. Gagnon, and Edward O. Laumann embarked on an unprecedented study of America's sex life. Working through the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, their staff of 220 interviewers spent seven months interviewing 3,432 scientifically selected respondents about all aspects of their sex lives, histories, and beliefs. More important, unlike the famous but inherently flawed reports of Alfred Kinsey, Redbook and Playboy magazines, Shere Hite, Samuel and Cynthia Janus, and others, this survey relied on a random sample of Americans rather than on an unrepresentative group of volunteers. The resulting data reveal not just what we do sexually but how society shapes even our most private sexual experiences. They show not just why we are the way we are, but what it might take to change this behavior.Sure to arouse considerable controversy, the survey directly contradicts many of the conclusions of previous reports and defies widely held conventional wisdom about America's sexual practices and beliefs, with startling revelations about how often people have sex, how many partners they have, and where they meet them; the likelihood that the AIDS epidemic will spread into the heterosexual population; what people like to do in bed; how many Americans are homosexual; the incidence of forced sex; and why some people are more satisfied with their sex lives than others.After years of misleading statistics and unsubstantiated claims, Sex in America presents a comprehensive, reliable look at America's collective sex life, the definitive word on American sexuality today.",

        "Title": "Dirty Little Secrets : The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics",
        "Authors": "By Sabato, Larry J. and Simpson, Glenn R.",
        "Description": "Fact: The Christian Coalition's 1994 voter guides appear to have been skewed to favor Republican candidates in key congressional races across the country, in direct contravention of federal election law.The truth is, the politicians couldn't be happier dickering over the remains of the welfare state. Because, as you'll learn in Dirty Little Secrets, there is probably not a politician in America who does not benefit directly, personally, and continually from the status quo.Fact: On the eve of the 1994 elections, mock \"pollsters\" called up thousands of voters in one Wisconsin congressional district to ask whether their electoral decisions would be influenced if they knew one of the candidates was a lesbian.Most politicians want to do the right thing. But they also want to be reelected, and the system is far stronger than any honest man or woman. The influence of money and the intricacies of the levers of power make it easier for politicians to ignore the law than to obey it. In Dirty Little Secrets you will read of the conservative movement's hidden manipulations in 1994, and learn the truth about Newt Gingrich's twenty-year program of political destabilization. The history of the corrupt House the Democrats built with the help of liberal interest groups stands revealed. And Larry J. Sabato and Glenn R. Simpson expose the corrupt and illegal tactics both parties have used for decades to protect and promote their own power.Fact: In 1994, in Alabama, one local election was decided by fewer than three hundred votes. Seventeen hundred ballots cast in that election were illegally admitted absentee ballots, some of them submitted by dead people.Sabato and Simpson's fresh reporting and thousands of hours of background research include interviews with influential politicians, consultants, and political operatives, Freedom of Information Act requests, and thousands of pages of obscure campaign reports. They prove corruption is not about bad apples or colorful local traditions. And they offer a completely original plan for reform - Deregulation Plus - that will frighten both parties and make the American electorate smile for the first time in years. Dirty Little Secrets pulls together the corruption story from all parts of the country so overwhelmingly that no one - from the White House to your house - will be able to deny that political reform must be one of the key issues of the 1996 election campaign.",

        "Title": "Introduction to Islamic Civilization",
        "Authors": "By Savory, Roger M. (EDT)",
        "Description": "This book is a wide-ranging and general introduction to Islamic civilisation from its origins to the present day. Writing in clear and non-technical language, Professor Savory's contributors seek answers to broad and important questions: how did a single civilisation develop in a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural region; how did Islamic internationalism come to be translated into powerful nationalist movements in modern times; how has the West been affected by its continuing contact with Islam; what factors have threatened Islamic civilisation in modern times, and is there a future for it at all. The book begins with a section on the geographical, ethnic and linguistic background of the Middle East, continues with an historical r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the Islamic period, and moves on to the core chapters on the religious, philosophical and legal foundations of Islamic society and its contributions to world civilisation in the fields of literature, art, science and medicine. The time-scale covers the pre-Islamic, medieval and modern periods, and care has been taken to draw out the implications of the interaction between Christian West and Islamic East from the Crusades down to the massive encroachment of the West upon the Muslim world - at military, political, economic and cultural levels - in the modern era. Introduction to Islamic Civilisation is based on a successful series of adult-education programmes broadcast on Canadian radio, organised by members of the Department of Islamic Studies at the University of Toronto. The material has been revised and rewritten for book publication and is offered as a genuinely introductory handbook on a vital and fascinating subject.",

        "Description": "From the fluid strokes in the characters denoting \"grace,\" \"enlightenment,\" and \"tranquility\" to the complex meanings inherent in the words for \"honor,\" \"love,\" and \"wisdom,\" the richness and depth of the Chinese language come alive in this compact, elegant volume of 40 beautifully rendered ideograms. Every character is accompanied by a simple chart showing its physical composition, stroke by stroke, as well as an informative text describing the myriad linguistic components from which its meaning is derived.As a result, the reader can grasp each character's significance and connection to centuries of Chinese philosophy and, ultimately, gain an understanding of the language beyond a mere familiarity with linguistic symbols.
