Andy Barker promised Tom he could get them there safely,  but Tom was reluctant to trust him: he had the lives of three actresses to consider,  and his personal feelings for Janice further heightened his concern. Then King Mabry  showed up. Although Tom didn\u2019t like the way he looked at Janice, he could see that  Mabry made Barker uneasy. So Tom invited Mabry to join them. Tom was right to be  worried, because Barker had a plan. He knew that the wagons carried something more  than actors and scenery. He and his men were going to steal it any way they could.  And that included murder.",

        "Title": "One Fifth Avenue",
        "Authors": "By Bushnell, Candace",
        "Description": "From one of the most consistently astute and engaging social commentators of our day comes another look at the tough and tender women of New York City--this time, through the lens of where they live. One Fifth Avenue, the Art Deco beauty towering over one of Manhattan's oldest and most historically hip neighborhoods, is a one-of-a-kind address, the sort of building you have to earn your way into--one way or another. For the women in Candace Bushnell's new novel, One Fifth Avenue, this edifice is essential to the lives they've carefully established--or hope to establish. From the hedge fund king's wife to the aging gossip columnist to the free-spirited actress (a recent refugee from L.A.), each person's game plan for a rich life comes together under the soaring roof of this landmark building. Acutely observed and mercilessly witty, One Fifth Avenue is a modern-day story of old and new money, that same combustible mix that Edith Wharton mastered in her novels about New York's Gilded Age and F. Scott Fitzgerald illuminated in his Jazz Age tales. Many decades later, Bushnell's New Yorkers suffer the same passions as those fictional Manhattanites from eras past: They thirst for power, for social prominence, and for marriages that are successful--at least to the public eye. But Bushnell is an original, and One Fifth Avenue is so fresh that it reads as if sexual politics, real estate theft, and fortunes lost in a day have never happened before. From Sex and the City through four successive novels, Bushnell has revealed a gift for tapping into the zeitgeist of any New York minute and, as one critic put it, staying uncannily \"just the slightest bit ahead of the curve.\" And with each book, she has deepened her range, but with a light touch that makes her complex literary accomplishments look easy. Her stories progress so nimbly and ring so true that it can seem as if anyone might write them--when, in fact, no one writes novels quite like Candace Bushnell. Fortunately for us, with One Fifth Avenue, she has done it again.",

        "Title": "The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community",
        "Authors": "By Korten, David C.",
        "Description": "In his classic international bestseller, When Corporations Rule the World, David Korten exposed the destructive and oppressive nature of the global corporate economy and helped spark a global resistance movement. Now, he shows that the problem runs deeper than corporate domination\u2014with far greater consequences.   Here, Korten argues that corporate consolidation of power is merely one manifestation of what he calls \u201cEmpire\u201d: the organization of society through hierarchy and violence that has largely held sway for the past 5,000 years. Empire has always resulted in misery for the many and fortune for the few, but now it threatens the very future of humanity. Korten points to global terrorism, climate change, and rising poverty as just a few of the signs that the burdens of Empire now exceed what people and planet will bear.  The Great Turning traces the roots of Empire to ancient times and charts the long evolution of its favored instruments of control, from monarchies and bureaucracies to the transnational institutions of the global economy. Korten also tells the parallel story of the attempt to develop a democratic alternative to Empire, beginning in Athens and continuing with the founding of the United States of America. But this remains an unfinished project\u2014Korten documents how elitists with an imperial agenda have consistently sought to undermine the bold and inspiring \u201cAmerican experiment,\u201c beginning in the earliest days of the republic and continuing to the present day. Empire is not inevitable, not the natural order of things\u2014we can turn away from it. Korten draws on evidence from sources as varied as evolutionary theory, developmental psychology, and religious teachings to make the case that \u201cEarth Community\u201d\u2014a life-centered, egalitarian, sustainable way of ordering human society based on democratic principles of partnership\u2014is indeed possible. And he details a grassroots strategy for beginning the momentous turning toward a future of as-yet-unrealized human potential. The Great Turning illuminates our current predicament, provides a framework for grasping the potential of this historic moment, and shows us how to take action for the future of our planet, our communities, and ourselves.",

The incredible landmark portrait of Warren Buffett's uniquely American life is now available in paperback, revised and updated by the author.Starting from scratch, simply by picking stocks and companies for investment, Warren Buffett amassed one of the epochal fortunes of the twentieth century--an astounding net worth of $10 billion, and counting. His awesome investment record has made him a cult figure popularly known for his seeming contradictions: a billionaire who has a modest lifestyle, a phenomenally successful investor who eschews the revolving-door trading of modern Wall Street, a brilliant dealmaker who cultivates a homespun aura.Journalist Roger Lowenstein draws on three years of unprecedented access to Buffett's family, friends, and colleagues to provide the first definitive, inside account of the life and career of this American original. Buffett\u00a0\u00a0explains Buffett's' investment strategy--a long-term philosophy grounded in buying stock in companies that are undervalued on the market and hanging on until their worth invariably surfaces--and shows how it is a reflection of his inner self.",

Soon it becomes obvious that Zoey has no choice: if she doesn't go to Kalona he will exact a fiery vengeance on those closest to her.

Pulled naked and barely breathing from the fire, the victim has no idea who she is, let alone who would do this to her -- or why. In her hospital bed she drifts in and out of consciousness, her only means of communicating a blink of the eye. And then an angel appears. Misguidedly known around town as the \"Angel of Death,\" Sister Anselm has devoted her life to working as an advocate for unidentified patients. To her burn patient, she is a savior. But to this Jane Doe's would-be killer, Sister Anselm's efforts pose a serious threat. Ali Reynolds is on the scene as the new media relations consultant for the Yavapai County Police Department, keeping reporters at bay and circumventing questions about arson and a link to a domestic terrorist group called Earth Liberation Front. But her job quickly becomes much more. As Ali struggles to help Sister Anselm uncover the helpless woman's identity, they realize that by locating the missing relatives they may be exposing the victim once more to a remorseless killer determined to finish the job. Faced with the possibility of putting all three of their lives in jeopardy, Ali fearlessly pursues justice -- and what she discovers is a secret even darker and more twisted than she ever could have imagined.With unerring skill, Jance delivers relentless suspense in what is surely her finest novel yet in this riveting and addictive series.",

But Linc had no idea what it really meant to be a househusband: To stay home every day, folding laundry, cleaning soap scum, and teaching his little girl to use the potty. To be ignored at parties by his wife\u2019s colleagues who see him as just a homemaker. To be looked upon with suspicious eyes by the neighborhood women who can\u2019t understand what sort of man would choose to stay home. And with each new day, Linc is sure that the next load of whites will be the one that sends him off the deep end.Though he has the house humming, Linc misses the outside world, longing to carry on an adult conversation with adult friends (the electrician and the UPS guy are starting to avoid him). Most of all he misses Jo, who is working all hours of the day and night and barely notices the fabulous dinners he slaves over, much less the husband who cooked them. And then there is Marilyn, the attractive next-door neighbor, who has been so friendly and supportive. . . .Now the only thing Linc knows for sure is that something\u2019s got to give. Should he go back to work and leave Violet in the hands of someone who is sure to be less competent? Or should he give in and embrace his role as househusband extraordinaire? At turns funny, neurotic, and endearingly vulnerable, Linc Menner will win your heart\u2013and make you wish you had a househusband all your own. (and you\u2019l love the recipes!).",

She has nothing but time now, as she recounts the tale of   Snow Flower, and asks the gods for forgiveness. In nineteenth-century China, when   wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women   in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication: nu   shu (\u201cwomen\u2019s writing\u201d). Some girls were paired with laotongs, \u201cold sames,\u201d in emotional   matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered   messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation   to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. With the arrival of a silk fan   on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their   friendship is sealed and they become \u201cold sames\u201d at the tender age of seven. As the   years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages,   loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing   a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their   lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart. Snow Flower and the Secret   Fan is a brilliantly realistic journey back to an era of Chinese history that is   as deeply moving as it is sorrowful. With the period detail and deep resonance of   Memoirs of a Geisha, this lyrical and emotionally charged novel delves into one of   the most mysterious of human relationships: female friendship.",

After, Casey left her high-powered practice and wealthy husband and opened a legal aid clinic. When an illegal Mexican immigrant is shot on a ranch outside Dallas, it makes the news, not because of the immigrant, but because of the shooter, Senator Tucker Dean. It looks like a hunting accident, and the well-loved young Senator spins the disaster artfully with his tearful press conference. . . until the sister in law of the victim steps forward with another tale. The senator's wife was regularly visiting the victim, so Casey theorizes he was shot by the husband for revenge. When INS takes the victim's daughter away and tries to deport his wife, it looks like a cover-up of epic proportions. Casey approaches the D.A.'s office with information, only to discover that no prosecutor will take on this case. The senator is powerful and on track for a presidential nomination in a few years, so no one wants to tangle with him. Casey is determined to see the truth come out. If the state won't prosecute a murderer, she will sue him in civil court on behalf of the mother. But this popular senator is wily, vindictive, and dangerous. What will happen to Casey when she goes up against a man who seems above the law?",

The exercises begin by asking you to select from magazines rooms that you love (your YESs) and those you don't (your NOs), then they help you to find words to express your impressions about a room's decoration, to distinguish the common denominators always present in the rooms you choose, and to pinpoint your likes and dislikes through your reactions to elements of a room's design, from architectural elements to furnishings to the color palette. PART II: EXERCISE YOUR TASTE Eleven methods taken in sequence explain the step-by-step process of decorating a room and show you how to incorporate what you have learned about your taste in Part I in order to create a decor that is comfortable and aesthetically pleasing to you.

        "Description": "Christopher Lowell has done it again! In response to thousands of letters requesting a book on small-room decorating, the Emmy Award-winning star of the Discovery Channel's most popular decorating show applies his innovative thinking to the challenge of turning cramped quarters into a comfortable, stylish home.  He takes the Seven Layers of Design system introduced in his first book one step further by applying it to small spaces and inspiring readers to create extraordinary rooms out of the ordinary.With his trademark energy and innovation, Lowell guides us through two modular homes, one designed in a traditional style, the other in a more modern decor, but both intended to offer the reader a myriad of design options and ideas.  The traditional home features a Nantucket-style master bath, a sunroom with faux stone walls, a French-influenced guest bedroom, and a separate dining room.  The modern home contains a kitchen finished in sophisticated stainless-steel paint, a living room-guest bedroom partitioned with sliding bookcases, and a Zen master bedroom with a space-saving platform bed.Room by room, Lowell tackles such problems as how to make the most of tiny master bedrooms, how to create several rooms from one, what to do with narrow hallways, how to conserve space by creating multipurpose rooms, and how to renovate a guest bathroom for under $100.  Before and after pictures show how anyone can perform miracles just by \"thinking outside the box.\" Once again, Christopher Lowell inspires readers to dream big, no matter how small their space.",

You'll find meticulously accurate depictions \u2014 ready for coloring \u2014 of 31 magnificent structures, from the early English motte-and-bailey strongholds to the romantic nineteenth-century royal residence at Neuschwanstein, built for King Ludwig II of Bavaria.The finely detailed drawings \u2014 each printed in authentic detail on a full page or two-page spread \u2014 appear in roughly chronological order and illustrate the architectural development of the castle from the primitive tower on the hill of the eleventh century to the sophisticated Norman castle of the mid-thirteenth century, to later structures that represented a shift from fortress to residential castles. Colorists are invited to re-create the appearance of such famed castles as Windsor and Caernarvon (Great Britain), Blarney (Ireland), the Segovia Alc\u00e1zar (Spain), Krak des Chevaliers (Syria), Hochosterwitz (Austria), Provins and Pierrefonds (France), and many more. Identifying captions provide concise background information on each structure's history, construction, and inhabitants.This attractive volume offers not only hours of educational entertainment for colorists of all ages but a fascinating glimpse of the history and architecture of the medieval era.",

        "Description": "From Andre Agassi, one of the most beloved athletes in history and one of the most gifted men ever to step onto a tennis court, a beautiful, haunting autobiography.Agassi\u2019s incredibly rigorous training begins when he is just a child. By the age of thirteen, he is banished to a Florida tennis camp that feels like a prison camp. Lonely, scared, a ninth-grade dropout, he rebels in ways that will soon make him a 1980s icon. He dyes his hair, pierces his ears, dresses like a punk rocker. By the time he turns pro at sixteen, his new look promises to change tennis forever, as does his lightning-fast return. And yet, despite his raw talent, he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the world\u2019s best, his greater confusion as he starts to win. After stumbling in three Grand Slam finals, Agassi shocks the world, and himself, by capturing the 1992 Wimbledon. Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.Agassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match and every relationship. Never before has the inner game of tennis and the outer game of fame been so precisely limned. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals from several generations\u2014Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer\u2014Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals a shattering loss of confidence. And he recounts his spectacular resurrection, a comeback climaxing with his epic run at the 1999 French Open and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.In clear, taut prose, Agassi evokes his loyal brother, his wise coach, his gentle trainer, all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf. Inspired by her quiet strength, he fights through crippling pain from a deteriorating spine to remain a dangerous opponent in the twenty-first and final year of his career. Entering his last tournament in 2006, he\u2019s hailed for completing a stunning metamorphosis, from nonconformist to elder statesman, from dropout to education advocate. And still he\u2019s not done. At a U.S. Open for the ages, he makes a courageous last stand, then delivers one of the most stirring farewells ever heard in a sporting arena.With its breakneck tempo and raw candor, Open will be read and cherished for years. A treat for ardent fans, it will also captivate readers who know nothing about tennis. Like Agassi\u2019s game, it sets a new standard for grace, style, speed, and power.",

A single mother, she has struggled to do everything right. She sees the pregnancy as an unimaginable tragedy for both Lily and herself.\u00a0Then comes word of two more pregnancies among high school juniors who happen to be Lily's best friends-and the town turns to talk of a pact. As fingers start pointing, the most ardent criticism is directed at Susan. As principal of the high school, she has always been held up as a role model of hard work and core values. Now her detractors accuse her of being a lax mother, perhaps not worthy of the job of shepherding impressionable students. As Susan struggles with the implications of her daughter's pregnancy, her job, financial independence, and long-fought-for dreams are all at risk.\u00a0The emotional ties between mothers and daughters are stretched to breaking in this emotionally wrenching story of love and forgiveness.

Comeback America is a tough-minded, innovative, inspiring guide to help us avoid the approaching economic abyss and put the country back on track again.As comptroller general of the United States and head of the Government Accountability Office (GAO)\u2014\"the nation's top auditor\"\u2014Walker warned Congress and the administration as the federal surplus became a giant deficit under George W. Bush. As president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, he now works full-time to raise public awareness regarding mounting debt burdens being imposed on future generations. Comeback America is his crucial manifesto, a way for President Obama to end out-of-control government spending and reform our tax, retirement, health care, defense, and other systems\u2014before it's too late.Walker believes that by 2030, absent significant reforms to current government programs and policies, federal taxes could double from\u00a0current levels, meaning less money and poorer education for kids\u2014which will hurt families along with our nation's economic strength and position in the world. If our foreign creditors\u2014such as China\u2014decide to buy fewer of our Treasury bonds, interest rates will rise and cars and homes will become less affordable. But it doesn't have to be that way. Comeback America shows how we can return to our founding principles of fiscal responsibility and stewardship for future generations. The book includes bold ideas to control spending, save Social Security, dramatically alter Medicare, and simplify the tax code\u2014all taking into account the Obama Administration's current efforts, which receive never-before-published assessments both complimentary and critical.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nonpartisan, nonideological, and filled with a love of the country its esteemed author has spent his life serving, Comeback America is a book for anyone interested in America's economic future\u2014in other words, a book everyone should read.",

It is August 1974, and a mysterious  tightrope walker is running, dancing, leaping between the towers, suspended a quarter  mile above the ground. In the streets below, a slew of ordinary lives become extraordinary  in bestselling novelist Colum McCann\u2019s stunningly intricate portrait of a city and  its people.  Let the Great World Spin is the critically acclaimed author\u2019s most ambitious  novel yet: a dazzlingly rich vision of the pain, loveliness, mystery, and promise  of New York City in the 1970s. Corrigan, a radical young Irish monk, struggles with  his own demons as he lives among the prostitutes in the middle of the burning Bronx.  A group of mothers gather in a Park Avenue apartment to mourn their sons who died  in Vietnam, only to discover just how much divides them even in grief. A young artist  finds herself at the scene of a hit-and-run that sends her own life careening sideways.  Tillie, a thirty-eight-year-old grandmother, turns tricks alongside her teenage daughter,  determined not only to take care of her family but to prove her own worth.\u00a0Elegantly  weaving together these and other seemingly disparate lives, McCann\u2019s powerful allegory  comes alive in the unforgettable voices of the city\u2019s people, unexpectedly drawn  together by hope, beauty, and the \u201cartistic crime of the century.\u201dA sweeping and  radical social novel, Let the Great World Spin captures the spirit of America in  a time of transition, extraordinary promise, and, in hindsight, heartbreaking innocence.  Hailed as a \u201cfiercely original talent\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle), award-winning novelist  McCann has delivered a triumphantly American masterpiece that awakens in us a sense  of what the novel can achieve, confront, and even heal.Praise for Let the Great World Spin\u201cThis is a gorgeous book, multilayered and deeply felt, and it\u2019s a damned lot of fun to read, too.

        "Title": "No Angel: My Harrowing Undercover Journey to the Inner Circle of the Hells Angels",
        "Authors": "By Dobyns, Jay and Johnson-Shelton, Nils",
        "Description": "From the first federal agent to infiltrate the inner circle of  the outlaw Hells Angels Motorcycle Club comes the inside story of the 21-month  operation that almost cost him his family, his sanity, and his life. Getting shot  in the chest as a rookie agent, bartering for machine guns, throttling down the highway  at 100 mph, and responding to a full-scale, bloody riot between the Hells Angels  and their rivals, the Mongols\u2014these are just a few of the high-adrenaline experiences  Dobyns recounts in this action-packed, hard-to-imagine-but-true story. Dobyns leaves  no stone of his harrowing journey unturned. At runs and clubhouses, between rides  and riots, Dobyns befriends bad-ass bikers, meth-fueled \u201cold ladies,\u201d gun fetishists,  psycho-killer ex-cons, and even some of the \u201cFilthy Few\u201d--the elite of the Hells Angels  who\u2019ve committed extreme violence on behalf of their club. Eventually, at parties  staged behind heavily armed security, he meets legendary club members such as Chuck  Zito, Johnny Angel, and the godfather of all bikers, Ralph \u201cSonny\u201d Barger. To blend  in with them, he gets full-arm ink; to win their respect, he vows to prove himself  a stone-cold killer. Hardest of all is leading a double life, which has him torn  between his devotion to his wife and children, and his pledge to become the first  federal agent ever to be \u201cfully patched\u201d into the Angels\u2019 near-impregnable ranks.  His act is so convincing that he comes within a hairsbreadth of losing himself.   Eventually, he realizes that just as he\u2019s been infiltrating the Hells Angels, they\u2019 ve been infiltrating him. And just as they\u2019re not all bad, he\u2019s not all good. Reminiscent  of Donnie Brasco\u2019s uncovering of the true Mafia, this is an eye-opening portrait  of the world of bikers--the most in-depth since Hunter Thompson\u2019s seminal work\u2014one  that fully describes the seductive lure criminal camaraderie has for men who would  otherwise be powerless outsiders. Here is all the nihilism, hate, and intimidation,  but also the freedom\u2014and, yes, brotherhood\u2014of the only truly American form of organized  crime.",

        "Authors": "By Chandrasekaran, Rajiv",
        "Description": "The fullest, most intimate account of life in the Green Zone, the sheltered bubble where idealistic Americans planned the occupation while Iraq fell apart.The Green Zone, Baghdad, 2003: in this walled-off compound of swimming pools and luxurious amenities, Paul Bremer and his Coalition Provisional Authority set out to fashion a new, democratic Iraq. Staffed by idealistic aides chosen primarily for their political affiliations and views on issues such as abortion, the CPA spent the crucial first year of occupation pursuing goals that had little to do with the immediate crises of a postwar nation. In this acclaimed firsthand account, the former Baghdad bureau chief of The Washington Post gives us an intimate and remarkably dispassionate portrait of life inside this Oz-like place, which continued unaffected by the growing mayhem outside. This is a quietly devastating portrait of imperial folly, and an essential book for anyone who wants to understand those early days when things went irrevocably wrong in Iraq.",
