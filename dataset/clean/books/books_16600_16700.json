        "Description": "In The Ends of the Earth, Robert D. Kaplan travels from the devastated countries of West Africa and the fundamentalist enclaves of Egypt and Iran to the culturally explosive lands of Central Asia, India, Pakistan, and Southeast Asia with hardly more than a notebook and a backpack.Kaplan's intention was to investigate firsthand the effect of population explosion and environmental degradation in these countries and to see how the various cultures he encountered responded to them. But as he traveled, talking to gun smugglers and government ministers, warlords and shantytown dwellers, he discovered that the real problem, in places as far afield as Sierra Leone and western China, was the reemergence of longstanding cultural rivalries and the dissolution of national boundaries as regions redefine themselves along ethnic and historic lines.Kaplan's ground-level experiences allow him to avoid grandiose generalizations about the clash of civilizations and to replace them with intimate portraits of the men and women he encounters: Rafighdoost, Khomeini's fiercely loyal chauffeur; Ali Abdel Razag, keeper of the Aswan High Dam; and Ayshe Tanrikulu, a squatter on Golden Mountain, a shantytown on the outskirts of Ankara, who hopes that her sons will one day be doctors or engineers. It is in the squalor of daily existence and in people's fears, frustrations, and dreams that Kaplan looks for the key to a country's future.The Ends of the Earth offers an intimate portrait of the devastated parts of the world, whose cultural disasters - like those in Bosnia, Chechnya, and Rwanda today - will dominate our attention and remake the world of tomorrow.",

Pastor Jim Cymbala believes that in the face of unspeakable tragedy, God is reaching out to the heart of a grieving city, to the people of a wounded nation, and to a world that fears what the future may hold. God\u2019s Grace from Ground Zero assures us that God hates the senseless evil that destroyed thousands of lives, and that this is a time when he is pouring out his mercy in a special way. The harvest is ripe, hearts that were closed are open to the gospel, and today, not tomorrow, is when we have the opportunity and responsibility to express Jesus through our words and through our deeds. Now is the time to love our families, our friends, and those around us. Now is the time to trust God and live for him like never before. And now, in the midst of our grief, our fear, and our lack of answers for things that make no sense, is the time to worship God with all our hearts.",

Ultimately, they came to face disappointment, exile, and, on occasion, death.  Brilliantly weaving together the strands of a tumultuous century in Arab political thought, history, and poetry, Ajami takes us from the ruins of Beirut's once glittering metropolis to the land of Egypt, where struggle rages between a modernist impulse and an Islamist insurgency, from Nasser's pan-Arab nationalist ambitions to the emergence of an uneasy Pax Americana in Arab lands, from the triumphalism of the Gulf War to the continuing anguished debate over the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.For anyone who seeks to understand the Middle East, here is an insider's unflinching analysis of the collision between intellectual life and political realities in the Arab world today.",

And that statistic only tells us about first trimester miscarriages. The emotional pain of longer-term miscarriages, and the untold numbers of mothers and fathers who keep silent about their hurt, make this form of child loss especially cruel.But in Silent Grief, author Clara Hinton brings a clear message of hope through the cold mourning. Writing of her own grief, and interviewing scores of women and men, she offers not pat answers, but instead show us this: You are not alone.Additionally, the author touches the tears of other forms of child loss: stillbirth, missing children, and adult children who succumb to accident or illness.The moving, honest responses to these interviews tells the reader that through the tears and rage and awful silence, God still loves us and knows our children intimately. King David knew this. He knew that one day he would reunited with his child.",

        "Description": "A recent Newsweek poll reports that 76 percent of Americans believe in heaven. Yet even avid believers have difficulty conjuring up more than vague images of halos, harps, and wispy angels in flowing robes. Anthony DeStefano knew there had to be a more complete, meaningful, and comforting vision of what heaven is like, and A TRAVEL GUIDE TO HEAVEN is the entertaining and enlightening result.Using the Bible as his guide, the author notes that heaven is not only a spiritual place, but also a physical place, a fabulous \u201cluxury resort\u201d more sumptuous than any on Earth. The residents are real, their bodies transformed into their most perfect selves\u2014physically, emotionally, and spiritually. By making a spiritual subject immensely physical, the book provides a picture of amazing places to visit, things to do, luxuries for pampering\u2014not to mention deep, abiding joy.Combining the clarity and logic of C. S. Lewis with a terrific sense of fun and adventure, DeStefano creates a brilliant, reassuring portrait of heaven, a place that has intrigued and puzzled humankind throughout history.  With its clear view of the afterlife, A TRAVEL GUIDE TO HEAVEN might best be compared to James Van Praagh's Talking to Heaven or Betty J. Eadie's Embraced by the Light in its tremendous message of comfort and reassurance.",

        "Description": "Lincoln is the cornerstone of Gore Vidal's fictional American chronicle, which includes Burr, 1876, Washington, D.C., Empire, and Hollywood. It opens early on a frozen winter morning in 1861, when President-elect Abraham Lincoln slips into Washington, flanked by two bodyguards. The future president is in disguise, for there is talk of a plot to murder him. During the next four years there will be numerous plots to murder this man who has sworn to unite a disintegrating nation. Isolated in a ramshackle White House in the center of a proslavery city, Lincoln presides over a fragmenting government as Lee's armies beat at the gates. In this profoundly moving novel, a work of epic proportions and intense human sympathy, Lincoln is observed by his loved ones and his rivals. The cast of characters is almost Dickensian: politicians, generals, White House aides, newspapermen, Northern and Southern conspirators, amiably evil bankers, and a wife slowly going mad. Vidal's portrait of the president is at once intimate and monumental, stark and complex, drawn with the wit, grace, and authority of one of the great historical novelists.\u00a0\u00a0 With a new Introduction by the author.",

The effect of the agreement on the three economies has generated controversy and some degree of alarm within each country.In this book, noted trade and development experts review the available literature on the effects of NAFTA on the three member countries and the world trading system. They evaluate how NAFTA will affect areas such as economic growth, employment, income distribution, industry, and agriculture in Canada, Mexico, and the United States; and consider the significance the trade agreement holds for the rest of the world.Drusill K. Brown begins the discussion by providing an overview and comparison of the general results from recent studies. Ra\u00fal Hinojosa-Ojeda and Sherman Robinson explore in greater detail the potential effects of NAFTA on wages and employment in Mexico and the United States. Sidney Wintrab reviews industry-specific effects of NAFTA, in particular, the environment, the social agenda, and human rights and democracy. Finally, Carlos Alberto Primo Braga considers the implications of NAFTA on the rest of the world.Following each of these chapters, international scholars assess the alternatives and provide recommendations for future research.",

In this comprehensive and systematic analysis of the major trends in American society during the past fifty years, he probes the weakening of popular party affiliations and the increased inability of elected representatives to rule. Centering his work on the crucial concept of social control, Janowitz orders and assesses a vast amount of empirical research to clarify the failure of basic social institutions to resolve our chronic conflicts.For Janowitz, social control denotes a society's capacity to regulate itself within a moral framework that transcends simple self-interest. He poses urgent questions: Why has social control been so drastically weakened in our advanced industrial society? And what strategies can we use to strengthen it again?The expanation rests in part on the changes in social structure which make it more and more complicated for citizens to calculate their political self-interest. At the same time, complex economic and defense problems also strain an already overburdened legislative system, making effective, responsive political rule increasingly difficult.Janowitz concludes by assessing the response of the social sciences to the pressing problem of social control and asserts that new forms of citizen participation in the government must be found.",

        "Description": "Starting in 1950, shortly after they met, and up through the 1990s, Ronald Reagan wrote letters to his wife, Nancy. In this book, those letters are woven into a portrait of a long and loving marriage, as Nancy Reagan shares not only the letters but also her reflections on them, and on the life that she and Ronald Reagan shared, from courtship, young marriage, and the White House years on through to her life today.This book offers insight into one of America's most famous couples and into the love story they lived. Through letters and reflections, the characters, personalities, and lives of an American president and his first lady are revealed. Over half a century, we see how Ronald Reagan wrote from the heart to the person he was closest to. Nancy Reagan comments on the letters, and writes with love and insight about her husband and the many phases of their life together. She describes how they met and fell in love and how their love grew over a long, eventful, and happy marriage, and she recalls the central role that letters, as well as cards and telegrams, played in their lives. The private life of this couple comes alive in this American story.",

        "Description": "Robert E. Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson comprised one of the greatest collaborations in American military history. This, the first biography to examine them both, probes the private lives and public careers of these consummate soldiers to find out just what the secret behind their extraordinary success was.They were men of starkly different personalities, but their contrasting characters superbly complemented one another, so that together they fought the Union machine to a standstill. Robert E. Lee, the son of an aristocratic southern family, attended West Point and married a great-granddaughter of Martha Washington. By the Civil War he was already one of the country's greatest generals, a hero of the Mexican War who, ironically, had been offered field command of the Union Army. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, a devout Calvinist, was a rigid man whose troops more often felt admiration than affection toward him. He met Lee at West Point when he was a cadet and Lee an engineering officer; Jackson was also a veteran of the Mexican War and was to become Lee's strong right arm. They joined forces in the spring of 1862 in the Seven Days battles at Richmond and went on to dazzling victories at Second Manassas, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. Their combined military genius almost won the war, but Jackson's tragic death - mortally wounded by the fire of his own men - spelled the beginning of the end of the Confederacy.Paul Casdorph's extensively researched and sweeping biography brings the legend of these two Southern heroes to life. With sparkling accounts of the Civil War campaigns and an insightful look at the role the Mexican War had in shaping the military thinking of these two men, Lee and Jackson sheds new light and understanding on these remarkable generals and the reasons for their unparalleled success on the battlefield.",

        "Description": "Maybe the Moon, Armistead Maupin&#39;s first novel since ending his bestselling Tales of the City series, is the audaciously original chronicle of Cadence Roth -- Hollywood actress, singer, iconoclast and former Guiness Book record holder as the world&#39;s shortest woman.  All of 31 inches tall, Cady is a true survivor in a town where -- as she says -- \"you can die of encouragement.\" Her early starring role as a lovable elf in an immensely popular American film proved a major disappointment, since moviegoers never saw the face behind the stifling rubber suit she was required to wear. Now, after a decade of hollow promises from the Industry, she is reduced to performing at birthday parties and bat mitzvahs as she waits for the miracle that will finally make her a star.  In a series of mordantly funny journal entries, Maupin tracks his spunky heroine across the saffron-hazed wasteland of Los Angeles -- from her all-too-infrequent meetings with agents and studio moguls to her regular harrowing encounters with small children, large dogs and human ignorance. Then one day a lanky piano player saunters into Cady&#39;s life, unleashing heady new emotions, and she finds herself going for broke, shooting the moon with a scheme so harebrained and daring that it just might succeed. Her accomplice in the venture is her best friend, Jeff, a gay waiter who sees Cady&#39;s struggle for visibility as a natural extension of his own war against the Hollywood Closet.  As clear-eyed as it is charming, Maybe the Moon is a modern parable about the mythology of the movies and the toll it exacts from it participants on both sides of the screen. It is a work that speaks to the resilience of the human spirit from a perspective rarely found in literature.",

Life is a work in progress, as ever-changing as a sandy shoreline along the beach. During the years Joan Anderson was a loving wife and supportive mother, she had slowly and unconsciously replaced her own dreams with the needs of her family. With her sons grown, however, she realized that the family no longer centered on the home she provided, and her relationship with her husband had become stagnant. Like many women in her situation, Joan realized that she had neglected to nurture herself and, worse, to envision fulfilling goals for her future. As her husband received a wonderful job opportunity out-of-state, it seemed that the best part of her own life was finished. Shocking both of them, she refused to follow him to his new job and decided to retreat to a family cottage on Cape Cod. At first casting about for direction, Joan soon began to take pleasure in her surroundings and call on resources she didn't realize she had. Over the course of a year, she gradually discovered that her life as an \"unfinished woman\" was full of possibilities. Out of that magical, difficult, transformative year came A Year by the Sea, a record of her experiences and a treasury of wisdom for readers.",

Their arrival in the Indian Stream triggers an escalating series of clashes that serve to sever the master-servant bond between them and offers both a second chance at life. But as the conflicts within the community spill over and attract the attention of outside authorities, Blood becomes a target for those seeking easy blame for the troubles. As plots unravel and violence escalates, two young men of uncertain identity appear, and Blood is forced to confront dread apparitions of his past while Sally is offered a final escape.",

        "Description": "In the London of 1795, intrigue and death walk the dark streets. England is at war with its neighbor and nemesis, France, and espionage is rampant. It is the job of Jonathan Absey at the Home Office to catch these spies, but his mind is elsewhere, his dreams haunted by the still unsolved murder of his fifteen-year-old daughter in these same streets. Desperately pursuing both investigations, he stumbles across a strange society of astronomers called the Company of Titius who are on a furious search of their own: to discover a long-lost star in the wide black sky. Soon, as he digs into their arcane world, their quest begins to merge with his own, and Absey finds himself discovering more than he had ever imagined - not only about spies and murderers but also about celestial numbers and the making of codes; about passions as unnatural as they are obsessive; and about the bonds of family...and the lengths we will go to preserve them.",
