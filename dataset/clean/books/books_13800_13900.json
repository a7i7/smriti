        "Title": "True at First Light: A Fictional Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Hemingway, Ernest and Hemingway, Patrick (EDT)",
        "Description": "Both revealing self-portrait and dramatic fictional chronicle of his final African safari, Ernest Hemingway's last unpublished work was written when he returned from Kenya in 1953. Edited by his son Patrick, who accompanied his father on the safari, True at First Light offers rare insights into the legendary American writer in the year of the hundredth anniversary of his birth.  A blend of autobiography and fiction, the book opens on the day his close friend Pop, a celebrated hunter, leaves Ernest in charge of the safari camp and news arrives of a potential attack from a hostile tribe. Drama continues to build as his wife, Mary, pursues the great black-maned lion that has become her obsession. Spicing his depictions of human longings with sharp humor, Hemingway captures the excitement of big-game hunting and the unparalleled beauty of the scenery -- the green plains covered with gray mist, zebra and gazelle traversing the horizon, cool dark nights broken by the sounds of the hyena's cry.  As the group at camp help Mary track her prize, she and Ernest suffer the \"incalculable casualties of marriage,\" and their attempts to love each other well are marred by cruelty, competition and infidelity. Ernest has become involved with Debba, an African girl whom he supposedly plans to take as a second bride. Increasingly enchanted by the local African community, he struggles between the attraction of these two women and the wildly different cultures they represent.  In True at First Light, Hemingway also chronicles his exploits -- sometimes hilarious and sometimes poignant -- among the African men with whom he has become very close, reminisces about encounters with other writers and his days in Paris and Spain and satirizes, among other things, the role of organized religion in Africa. He also muses on the act of writing itself and the author's role in determining the truth. What is fact and what is fiction? This is a question that was posed by Hemingway's readers throughout his career and is one of his principal subjects here.  Equally adept at evoking the singular textures of the landscape, the thrill of the hunt and the complexities of married life, Hemingway weaves a tale that is rich in laughter, beauty and profound insight. True at First Light is an extraordinary publishing event -- a breathtaking final work from one of this nation's most beloved and important writers.",

        "Title": "Your Sixth Sense: Activating Your Psychic Potential",
        "Authors": "By Naparstek, Belleruth",
        "Description": "You know the feeling -- deja vu, already knowing what someone will say before they speak, a gut instinct that overrides logic, hearing from a distant friend you&#39;d only just thought of that day. It happens to everyone, but few of us acknowledge these occurrences as manifestations of our own psychic ability. Now, bestselling author Belleruth Naparstek reclaims the world of psychic phenomena from its sideshow trappings, examining scientific data and showing each of us how to tap our own latent powers of awareness and perception.  Naparstek, one of the country&#39;s leading teachers and speakers on developing the powers of the mind and heart, has trained thousands of individuals in using guided imagery techniques for psychic development and improved health and healing. Her powerful techniques have reached a wide audience--from \"the intuitively gifted to those whose third eye seemed virtually cemented shut.\"  With Your Sixth Sense,  Naparstek shares her proven methods in a guide that is both practical and wonderfully informative. Based on her own experience, her work with clients, and interviews with more than forty highly skilled \"intuitives,\" or psychics, Your Sixth Sense provides both a  thorough exploration of the nature of psychic ability--how and why it works--and a step-by-step guide filled with specific suggestions and  exercises carefully designed to help you foster, track, and illuminate your own rich output of psychic experience.  In an engaging, conversational style, Naparstek tackles the subject so often shunted to the realm of cut-rate fortune tellers, psychic hotlines, and television exposes on the paranormal, offering a thoroughly accessible scientific explanation of the physics of ESP, a detailed description of what happens in the mind just before and during an intuitive \"pop,\" and much more. Your Sixth Sense is the only guide you&#39;ll need for recognizing, utilizing, and expanding the dormant powers of your own mind. This is a book about how to recognize, cultivate, and direct the natural gift that we all are born with: our sixth sense. When all is said and done, our ability to know things in a way that leaps over \"normal\" cognition and perception and just shows up as a sudden intuition or a pop of psychic awareness is an altogether logical, natural, and predictable human skill. This book shows you how the sixth sense is simply standard-issue equipment, along with our eyes, ears, tongues, noses and skin. It is only as magical and as ordinary as they are--which is plenty magical enough--but no more and no less. --from the Preface  \" I loved this book. Reading it was an experience of remembering my own intuition and learning to trust it even more. Belleruth&#39;s insights are practical, grounded, validating, and helpful. This is a well-researched, thoughtful how-to-book, filled with stories and exercises, and accessible at any number of levels. There is truly something here for everyone.\" --Christiane Northrup, M.D., author of Women&#39;s Bodies, Women&#39;s Wisdom  \"Belleruth Naparstek&#39;s penetrating study of intuitives has transformed this brilliant classic, which unites the logic of the mind with the wisdom of the heart. Her wit, intellect, and compassion not only illuminate the science of the sixth sense but also provide a sound, practical framework for the development ;of psychic potential. Grounded in the cultivation of empathy, the exercises in this book will open your heart and expand your sense of intimate connectedness with this remarkable universe.\"  --Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., author of Minding the Body, Mending the Mind and A Woman&#39;s Book of Life  \"I do not know of any other book that combines the wisdom of a psychotherapist, the knowledge of a scholar, the skill of a master hypnotist, the sensitivity of a psychic intuitive, and the memories of a remarkable collection of gifted practitioners. This book is a treasure!\" --Jeffrey Mishlove, Ph.D.,  president of Intuition Network and author of Roots of Consciousness",

Their breakup sent shock waves around the world, as growing suspicions were officially confirmed: Their fairy-tale marriage was just that - a fairy tale. Not only was the lily-white veil stripped away from their private lives, but the British monarchy itself was suddenly under scathing scrutiny. After all the headlines, the whispers, the rumors, the damaging claims and counterclaims by intimate friends of each, the full inside story of Diana, Charles, and their doomed union is now revealed - by the one person uniquely qualified to tell the lurid and fascinating tale of royal romance, rivalry, and scandal.James Whitaker is famous in England as the authority on the Royal Family - the only journalist to have had access to all the members of the House of Windsor for more than two decades of exclusive reportage. At the same time, he knew the teenage Lady Diana Spencer long before the royal wedding bells.With vivid personality profiles of an awe-inspiring gallery of characters, with unblushing and authentic depictions of how the Royals live and love, with utter honesty about both the monarchy and the girl now exiled from its charmed circle, Diana vs. Charles offers the most staggering, far-reaching disclosures about the greatest personal crisis ever to shake the Royal Family.",

As a writer, she's had enough rejection to sink a ship -- or at least a writing career. It's time to find a new job. Teaching elementary school sounds good. Although the work may not be glamorous, it offers many of the compensations that writing lacks. Steady paychecks. The camaraderie of colleagues. And the children -- to give her life a clear purpose.  As she's committing herself to getting what she wants from her work, Charlotte decides to break free from her noncommittal boyfriend. She deserves better! She may be giving up her dream of being a recognized novelist, but in return she'll find a stable income, job satisfaction, and even love.  Won't she?  Of course she will. Any minute now. Just as soon as she figures out how to cope with twenty yelling first-graders, her nasty coworkers, and a series of romantic misadventures that fall far short of true love.  Charlotte's struggle to navigate the waters of a new career, a new single life, and the loss of her identity as a writer make Second Draft Of My Life a funny, compulsively readable gem. From an author The Boston Globe applauded as \"very, very good on the business of falling in and out of love,\" it is part romantic comedy, part manual for living, and wholly triumphant.",

In 2001, Cindi Broaddus was a passenger in a car driving along a lonely highway on her way toward a much\u2013anticipated vacation. Suddenly, the predawn peace was shattered when an unknown assailant threw a gallon\u2013sized jar full of sulphuric acid off an overpass and through the windshield. Though Broaddus was covered with second\u2013 and third\u2013degree burns across her face and body, miraculously she did not die.  Today, she is not only alive and well, but has a positive message of survival and hope to share. A Random Account recounts Broaddus&#39;s incredible journey from life\u2013threatening disaster to recovery. Throughout her years\u2013long, often excruciating recuperation \u2013 involving numerous reconstructive surgeries, multiple skin grafts, and implanted tissue expanders \u2013 this single mother of three has had one goal: to prevent such a terrible crime from happening again. Although her attacker has never been caught, Broaddus travels far and wide, sharing her story, lobbying for improving highway safety, and offering hope and down\u2013to\u2013earth guidance for other victims of senseless tragedy. For such a random act can happen to anyone, turning one&#39;s life upside down in an instant. As compelling as it is important, A Random Act is a must\u2013read tale of tragedy and triumph from a truly remarkable woman.",

In Jinxed, smart, saucy sleuth Regan Reilly faces a new challenge -- the case of the missing wedding guest.  Regan, an L.A.-based private detective, returns to her office after a vacation with her beau, Jack \"no relation\" Reilly. Their tour of the wineries in Napa Valley and Santa Barbara County is cut short when Jack has to fly back to New York City, where he is the head of the Major Case Squad of the NYPD. Their last stop had been at Altered States, a run-down winery owned by three siblings who are all former hippies -- Lilac, Earl, and Leon Weldon. Not knowing how soon it would be put to use, Regan leaves her business card behind.  Within minutes of being back to work, Regan gets an excited call from Lilac. The Weldon family has been invited to the wedding of ninety-three-year-old Lucretia Standish, a former silent-screen star, who made a killing in a dot-com before it went bankrupt. Lucretia had been married to the Weldons' Uncle Haskell and had invested the money she inherited from Haskell in the dot-com. Lucretia's maid, Phyllis, clues Lilac in on the fact that Lucretia plans to give the Weldons $2 million each -- if they all show up at the wedding. The wedding is two days away, and there is only one problem -- Lilac's daughter, Whitney, aka Freshness, a young actress, has taken off on one of her go-with-the-flow weekends. Whitney is out of touch and goes where the wind blows. If it doesn't blow her back into town by Sunday morning, the Weldon family will be out $8 million.  Regan's job is to find Whitney. But unbeknownst to Regan, there's someone else on the hunt. Lucretia's fianc\u00e9, the much younger Edward Fields, has hired an accomplice in crime to locate Whitney and keep her away from the wedding. Edward knows Whitney will recognize him as the con man she'd met in acting class in New York. He wants to say \"I do\" to Lucretia and her millions before Whitney can protest. When Edward finds out that Regan Reilly has been hired to find the missing Whitney, he gives the order to get rid of her as well.  Meanwhile, Lucretia is befriended by a gang of bikers, the story of her upcoming nuptials is featured on national television news, and wildfires are threatening to consume the barn where Whitney is being held captive.  As in her previous novels, Carol Higgins Clark has created a novel that is both exciting and vastly entertaining. As no less a master of suspense than Nelson DeMille has said, \"Clark's writing is elegantly clear and concise, her characters are witty and engaging, and her plots and pacing are perfect.\" And in Jinxed, she is at her very considerable best.",

        "Title": "Home Lands: Portraits of the New Jewish Diaspora",
        "Authors": "By Tye, Larry",
        "Description": "The idea for this book came to Larry Tye as he traveled overseas as a reporter for the Boston Globe. In each city he visited he was intrigued by a reawakening of practice and spirit of the long repressed Jewish community. And the more communities he saw close-up, the clearer it became to him that the Jewish world was being reshaped and revitalized in ways that were not reflected in what he was reading about the disappearing diaspora and the vanishing Jews of America.The result is Home Lands, an narrative that tells the story of the new Jewish diaspora. Tye picked seven Jewish communities from Boston to Buenos Aires and Dusseldorf to Dnepropetrovsk deep in the Ukraine, and in each he zeroes in on a single family or congregation whose tale reflects the wider community's history and current situation. He met each community's leaders, talked with their scores of young people and old, and went with them to High Holiday services and Sabbath celebrations.The first impression that emerges from his travels is each city's uniqueness. Far more striking than the differences, however, is the unity. Jews all over the world still have enough customs and rituals in common for outsiders to see them as part of the same people, and for them to define themselves that way. It is that new comfort level, that sense of finally feel comfortable in the lands where they are living, that is at the heart of this engrossing book. Readers' eyes will be opened to how Germany, just a generation after the genocide, has the world's fastest-growing Jewish population; how the Jews of Buenos Aires have carved a place for themselves in a land that also gave refuge to Nazi henchmen like Adolph Eichman, and how Ireland is home to a tight-knit Jewish community that, remarkably, has produced Jewish Lord Mayors in Belfast, Cork and, twice from the same family, in Dublin. In Boston, Tye tells the story of his own family, whose roots run deep in the city's Jewish community.Home Lands is a book that is deeply personal even as it sheds light on the larger Jewish experience.",

        "Title": "Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession",
        "Authors": "By Pham, John-Peter",
        "Description": "The death of Pope John Paul II and consequent election of Pope Benedict XVI has shed light on a political process that the world has not been privy to for almost twenty-six years. People from around the world gathered in St. Peter's Square, wondering who the next Vatican leader would be and how the election process really worked, while everyone from international news correspondents to local priests added their own opinions to the debate.In Heirs of the Fisherman, former Vatican insider John-Peter Pham presents a candid portrait of the modern Vatican, the only account to reveal the striking changes to papal succession procedures made by John Paul II. Blending political and ecclesiastical history, Pham goes beyond a mere description of the complex rituals to offer rare insight into the dramatic shifts inside the College of Cardinals, whose 100 members now hail from 50 nations around the globe. He takes us into the secret conclave, where the electors were kept under lock and key, until they had selected a new pope. He also includes a chapter devoted to the intrigues of the 20th century where the first conclave had an emperor's veto and the last was won by the first non-Italian in four centuries becauase the Italians were bitterly divided. With a new Preface, Afterword, and appendices that include an English translation of the last will and testament of Pope John Paul II,Heirs of the Fisherman is an illuminating history and must-have guide to this vitally important world event. It will continue to be an indispensable reference to observers of future Catholic Church politics.",

In doing so, he establishes the song as a creed by which busy Christian adults can live and grow.",

Much better. But first, you need time to figure out what you want to do with the rest of your life.In Halftime, Bob focuses on this important time of transition--the time when, as he says, a person pauses to consider what will make their remaining years rich and meaningful.As Buford explains, 'My passion is to inspire business and professional leaders to embrace God's calling and move from success to significance.'To help people at midlife to embark on their 'personal renaissance,' Buford lifts up the important questions we need to ask:What am I really good at?What do I want to do?What is most important to me?What do I want to be remembered for?If my life were absolutely perfect, what would it look like?Buford fills Halftime with a blend of personal insight, true-life examples, and hit-the-nail-on-the-head quotes from men who have successfully navigated the exhilarating and potentially dangerous shoals of midlife.The real test of a man is not when he plays the role that he wants for himself, but when he plays the role destiny has for him.--Vaclav HavelThe thing to understand is myself, to see what God really wishes me to do . . . to find the idea for which I can live and die.--Soren KierkegaardMidlife. Halftime. It doesn't need to be a time of crisis; it can be a catalyst. Bob Buford provides the encouragement and insight to propel your life on a new course away from mere success to true significance--and the best years of your life.",

        "Description": "Spiritual Literacy answers the universal question, \"How can I live a spiritual life every day?\" Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, who have been covering contemporary culture and the spiritual renaissance for more than twenty-five years, believe that we can read the texts of our lives and of the world around us for sacred meaning. All we need is spiritual literacy.To illustrate their point, the Brussats present more than 650 \"readings\" about daily life from present-day authors - spiritual teachers, essayists, novelists, filmmakers, poets, naturalists, and social activists. This collection is unprecedented - an enthralling treasury of brief, \"aha!\" passages from such writers as Maya Angelou, Wendell Berry, Ram Dass, Annie Dillard, Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Robert Fulghum, Eduardo Galeano, Thich Nhat Hanh, Barbara Kingsolver, Jonathan Kozol, Kathleen Norris, Henri J. M. Nouwen, Anne Tyler, and many more. The Brussats add demonstrations of spiritual literacy based on their personal experiences and their interpretations of contemporary movies, songs, and television dramas.These remarkable readings tutor us in the art of lingering with our experiences and seeing the world with fresh eyes. They offer spiritual perspectives on things, places, nature, animals, leisure activities, creative pursuits, work, body, illness, death, relationships, and community.Spiritual literacy does not require that we become masters of certain religious texts or that we climb to a high rung on the ladder of enlightenment. Indeed, it is the very opposite of such elitism. At the end of each chapter, the Brussats invite their readers to practice spiritual literacy themselves through journal exercises, household projects, and rituals.",

        "Title": "The Roaring 2000s: Building the Wealth and Life Style You Desire in the Greatest Boom in History",
        "Authors": "By Dent, Harry S.",
        "Description": "In his bestselling book, The Great Boom Ahead, published in 1993, Harry Dent, one of the world's most prescient economic prognosticators, stood practically alone in forecasting a new age of prosperity emerging in the 1990s and extending into the new century. Dent foresaw a booming stock market, falling mortgage rates, and the resurgence of America as the premier global economic superpower. All of his predictions have come to fruition.  Now, in The Roaring 2000s, Dent focuses his visionary eye on the full spectrum of changes that will follow in the wake of the burgeoning turn-of-the-century economy. According to Dent, how and where we work and live is about to change more drastically than at any time in our history due to the convergence of the mainstreaming of the Internet and other technologies and the peak spending years of the aging baby boomers. This will result in nothing less than the greatest boom in history and an unprecedented opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs, great buys in real estate, and a wealth of high-quality lifestyle choices for the savvy people who anticipate these changes. We will we such rapid and exciting change as we have not seen since the dizzying pace of the productivity revolution unleashed by the assembly line in the Roaring Twenties.  Dent not only offers detailed investment strategies aimed at exploiting the coming boom for the next fifteen years but he also explains future trends in the job market, technology, demographics, and real estate. He foresees the next great population migration and explores the radically different business and organizational structures that will be the offspring of the Information Age. At the crux of these changes is the fundamental shift to a new network model wherein front-line human \"browsers\" focus on intimately understanding the needs of a unique segment of customers and coordinate the products or expertise of specialized back-line human \"servers\" to customize solutions.  With new research tools applied to the trends that have developed within the last few years, The Roaring 2000s reveals concrete predictions and indepth insights into the next decade, including:   A Dow that continues to soar and will eventually reach at least 21,500, and possibly 35,000, by the year 2008  The importance of \"gazelles,\" small- to medium-sized, high-growth companies, which today are creating most of of the jobs in this country  The rapid future economic development in countries in die Far East, South America, and Eastern Europe, and select areas of Africa, and what that means for investment, employment, and business growth opportunities now  The Roaring 2000s also describes the lifestyle changes these developments will inspire, including:  The New American Deam -- why changing techologies could mean a return to small-town living and which nine types of boomtowns will offer the highest quality of life in the decades ahead  Investment strategies that will help readers get the most out of a rapidly changing world  It is essential, Dent explains, to understand the magnitude and nature of the forces changing our economy and lifestyles in order to take advantage of the invaluable, emerging opportunities for significantly improving ones quality of life. The Roaring 2000s is a necessary guidebook to the not-so-distant future.",
