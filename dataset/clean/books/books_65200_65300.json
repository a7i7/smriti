        "Description": "This book provides a new approach to management and strategy in the business environment by addressing the issues that arise when a firm is embedded in the nonmarket environment, or the legal, political, and social context in which the firm is embedded. Its approach is a managerial one, rather than a public policy or social responsibility perspective, and focuses on issues of importance to managers of firms, emphasizing analysis and reasoning as the foundations for forming effective and responsible business strategies.  The book gives conceptual frameworks for analyzing the business environment. They are: 1) understanding issues and their development, 2) strategy formulation, 3) analyzing the news media, 4) political analysis, 5) market failures, 6) the economics and politics of government intervention, 7) the economics and politics of international trade, 8) country analysis, and 9) ethics analysis and decision-making. These frameworks are based in the disciplines of economics, political science, law, and ethics and are applied to the environment of business in the United States and other countries, including China, Japan, and the European Union. The book contains 73 case studies, including Microsoft, eBay, ScheringPlough, Citigroup, DoubleClick, and British Petroleum.  For managers in firms in the United States and other countries, and government employees whose jobs deal with the policy-making and business.",

        "Description": "Foreword by Ralph Nader. In Corporation Nation Derber addresses the unchecked power of today's corporations to shape the way we work, earn, buy, sell, and think\u2014the very way we live. Huge, far-reaching mergers are now commonplace, downsizing is rampant, and our lines of communication, news and entertainment media, jobs, and savings are increasingly controlled by a handful of global\u2014and unaccountable\u2014conglomerates. We are, in effect, losing our financial and emotional security, depending more than ever on the whim of these corporations. But it doesn't have to be this way, as this book makes clear. Just as the original Populist movement of the nineteenth century helped dethrone the robber barons, Derber contends that a new, positive populism can help the U.S. workforce regain its self-control. Drawing on core sociological concepts and demonstrating the power of the sociological imagination, he calls for revisions in our corporate system, changes designed to keep corporations healthy while also making them answerable to the people. From rewriting corporate charters to altering consumer habits, Derber offers new aims for businesses and empowering strategies by which we all can make a difference.",

This book is an essential guide for parents, teachers, or other adults involved with teenagers who may e affected by these disorders. By bringing together two strands of expertise--that of mental health professionals and of parents who have lived through the experience of their own teenager's mental illness--If Your Adolescent Has an Anxiety Disorder provides adult readers with the clinical information and practical advice they need to understand and help the teen. There are chapters detailing four the different types of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, generalized anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and post-traumatic stress disorders. Each includes a clearly written definition, a discussion of factors that can contribute to developing the disorder, treatment information, and case studies based on a real family's own experience with the disease. Tips and quotes from parents are sprinkled liberally throughout the text, and helpful sidebars provide more detailed information. The authors also provide a chapter fully dedicated to discussing treatment options, including what role parents play in treatment, how to juggle treatment and school, and how to handle insurance and managed care issues. Knowing the right information about anxiety disorders is the first step towards helping adolescents who are dealing with them grow to become healthy, happy adults.",

Drawing from thousands of hours of previously unavailable (and still classified) tape-recorded meetings between the highest levels of the American military command in Vietnam, A Better War is an insightful, factual, and superbly documented history of these final years. Through his exclusive access to authoritative materials, award-winning historian Lewis Sorley highlights the dramatic differences in conception, conduct, and-at least for a time-results between the early and later years of the war. Among his most important findings is that while the war was being lost at the peace table and in the U.S. Congress, the soldiers were winning on the ground. Meticulously researched and movingly told, A Better War sheds new light on the Vietnam War.",

        "Title": "Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah (Volume 1)",
        "Authors": "By Burton, Richard F.",
        "Description": "Impelled by wanderlust and the spirit of adventure and aided by an extraordinary facility in Eastern languages, Sir Richard Burton (1821-90) was one of the great traveler-explorers of history. He was the first European to enter the capital of Somaliland and the first to discover the Great Lakes of Central Africa. He was also an Orientalist of the first rank.But it is for his pilgrimage in 1853 to Mecca and Medina and the most sacrosanct shrines of Islam that Burton is best known \u2014 and for his celebrated book that recorded his experiences during the journey. Successfully posing as a wandering dervish, he gained admittance to the holy Kaabah and to the Tomb of the Prophet at Medina and participated in all the rituals of the Hadj (pilgrimage). He is still one of the very few non-Moslems to visit and return from Mecca.Above all, Burton was a sharp observer \u2014 of character, customs, and physical surroundings. These pages contain a treasury of material on Arab life, beliefs, manners and morals; detailed descriptions of religious ceremonies, mosques, temples, etc.; and a variety of ethnographic, economic, and geographical information. Whether telling of the crowded caravan to Mecca, engaging in minute analysis of Bedouin character, waxing lyrical about a desert landscape, or reporting conversations with townsfolk or fellow pilgrims, Burton gives us a vivid picture of the region and its people.Along with his thorough familiarity with the cultures and languages of the Middle East, Burton exhibited a resourcefulness and presence of mind that were to serve him well along the way. These qualities saw him through many a taut situation in a country where violence was easily kindled. And they permitted him to get to and into places a man with less enterprise would never have dreamed of going.This book\u2019s value to historians of culture and religion, Orientalists, and other scholars is obvious. Yet it is as a great classic of travel that it has attracted such a wide audience. Burton\u2019s highly personal style, vigorous opinions, and his matter-of-fact humor against a backdrop of constant hazard and possible exposure have delighted tens of thousands of readers for more than a century. This reprint gives today\u2019s readers an opportunity to enjoy this unique work.",

What if she is killing herself? Can she stop?",

Raw formats, however, changed all of that by allowing you to retrieve images before any in-camera processing has been performed. Photoshop\u2019s Adobe Camera Raw plug-in makes that process even easier by providing a standardized way of accessing and working with these uncompressed digital negatives in your favorite image-manipulation software. In the first volume devoted exclusively to the topic, best-selling author Bruce Fraser shows you how to take advantage of Adobe Camera Raw to set white balance, optimize contrast and saturation, handle noise, correct tint, and recover lost detail in images before converting them to another format. After learning about the raw formats themselves, you\u2019ll discover hands-on techniques for exposing and shooting for digital raw, using Bridge, Adobe\u2019s new standalone file browser, to preview images and automate tasks, and building a workflow around the digital raw process.",
