        "Title": "Justice William J. Brennan, Jr: Freedom First",
        "Authors": "By Gallen, David, Goldman, Roger, and Brennan, William J",
        "Description": "Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. sat for thirty-four years on the United States Supreme Court. Throughout his tenure on the Court he meticulously examined the body of Constitutional law - and effectively resuscitated its spirit. A champion of minorities and a spokesman for the politically dispossessed, he passionately defended civil rights and strove to bring the nation's disenfranchised into the mainstream of American life. He advanced the political empowerment of American cities and suburbs. He essentially wrote the modern law of freedom of speech and the press.Justice Brennan's retirement in 1990 occasioned tributes from a host of associates, former law clerks, attorneys, judges, professors, journalists, and friends. The reflections on Brennan in Part I of this volume provide intimate, often humorous glimpses into a generous, warm, open-hearted man who also happened to be an intellectual giant and outstanding jurist.In Part II the jurisprudence of Justice Brennan is comprehensively surveyed and lucidly discussed by author and Constitutional law professor Roger Goldman. With care he examines - and in layman's terms explains - Brennan's positions on the issues central to the justice's career: the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, civil rights, education, abortion, obscenity, and capital punishment.Eloquent, persuasive, and faithful to his vision, Justice Brennan authored more than a thousand opinions, concurrences, and dissents in the course of his judicial career. Part III of the book offers twelve landmark decisions written by Brennan that show clearly why history will place him beside John Marshall, Louis Brandeis, and Oliver Wendell Holmes as one of the truly great justices in the annals of the United States Supreme Court.",

        "Title": "Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II",
        "Authors": "By Weigel, George",
        "Description": "Given unprecedented access to Pope John Paul II and the people who have known and worked with him throughout his life, George Weigel presents a groundbreaking portrait of the Pope as a man, a thinker, and a leader whose religious convictions have defined a new approach to world politics -- and changed the course of history.  John Paul II has systematically addressed every major question on the world's agenda at the turn of the millennium: the human yearning for the sacred, the meaning of freedom, the glories and challenges of human sexuality, the promise of the women's movement, the quest for a new world order, the nature of good and evil, the moral challenge of prosperity, and the imperative of human solidarity in the emerging global civilization.By bringing the age-old wisdom of biblical religion into active conversation with contemporary life and thought, the Pope \"from a far country\" has crafted a challenging proposal for the human future that is without parallel in the modern world.  Weigel explores new information about the Pope's role in some of the recent past's most stirring events, including the fall of communism; the Vatican/Israel negotiation of 1991-92; the collapse of the Philippine, Chilean, Nicaraguan, and Paraguayan dictatorships during the 1980s; and the epic papal visit to Cuba. Weigel also includes previously unpublished papal correspondence with Leonid Brezhnev, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Deng Xiaoping, and draws on hitherto unavailable autobiographical reminiscences by the Pope.  Witness to Hope also discusses the Pope's efforts to build bridges to other Christian communities, and to Judaism, Islam, and other great world religions; presents an analysis of John Paul's proposals for strengthening democratic societies in the twenty-first century; and offers synopses of every major teaching document in the pontificate.  Rounding out the dramatic story of Pope John Paul II are fresh translations of his poetry; detailed personal anecdotes of the Pope as a young man, priest, and friend, sketched by those who knew him best; and in-depth interviews with Catholic leaders throughout the world.  A magisterial biography of one of the most important figures -- some might argue, the most important figure -- of the twentieth century, Witness to Hope is an extraordinary testimony to the man and his accomplishments, and a papal biography unlike any other.",

In this remarkable study, David Starkey argues that the king was not a depraved philanderer but someone seeking happiness -- and a son. Knowingly or not, he elevateda group of women to extraordinary heights and changed the way a nation was governed.Six Wives is a masterful work of history that intimately examines the rituals of diplomacy, marriage, pregnancy, and religion that were part of daily life for women at the Tudor Court. Weaving new facts and fresh interpretations into a spellbinding account of the emotional drama surrounding Henry's six marriages, David Starkey reveals the central role that the queens played in determining policy. With an equally keen eye for romantic and political intrigue, he brilliantly recaptures the story of Henry's wives and the England they ruled.",

        "Title": "Direct From Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry",
        "Authors": "By Dell, Michael and Fredman, Catherine",
        "Description": "In 1983, Michael S. Dell, then an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, drove away from his parents' Houston home in a white BMW  he'd bought selling subscriptions to his hometown newspaper. In the backseat were three personal computers.  Today, he is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dell Computer Corporation, an $18 billion company, the second-largest manufacturer and marketer of computers in the world. Founded on a deceptively simple premise--to deliver high-performance computer systems directly to the end user--Dell Computer is the envy of its competition, constantly growing at five  times the industry rate, and a perennial darling of Wall Street: its stock is up more than 36,000 percent this decade, and more than 200 percent in the last year.  In  Direct From Dell, Michael Dell himself tells the incredible story of Dell Computer's successful rise, beginning in his college dorm room with $1,000 in capital.  In these pages, you'll see the formation of a great visionary--and a great company. You'll meet the young Dell who, at the tender age of eight, had already begun looking \"to eliminate unnecessary steps\" and who, as a numbers-loving adolescent, was inspired by a newfound fascination with computers to save his money to buy a coveted Apple II--only to promptly take it apart. You'll encounter a young visionary who, upon witnessing  the inefficiencies of an exploding industry, challenged conventional wisdom and set out to do nothing less than  beat IBM at its own game. In so doing, Dell forever changed the way things \"had always been done\" in the computer industry.  You'll also see the birth of a Dell  hallmark--the direct model--which, in its ability to reach the customer directly, eliminated not only a substantial middleman markup but also the possibility of costly excess inventory, setting the stage for other extraordinary achievements. In an industry notorious for its unreliable service, Dell utilized its direct customer relationships to pioneer the concept of customer \"support\"--and didn't rest until the caliber of its service was rivaled only by the quality of its products and its speed of delivery.  But the story of Dell Computer is no fairy tale. Marked by uncharacteristically rapid growth, the company was faced with challenges that could have threatened its very existence. From forays into retail to under- (and over-) developed product lines, Dell learned some hard lessons along the way--and emerged stronger as a result.  The strategies born of those times--unrivaled speed to market; superior customer service; a fierce commitment to producing  constantly high-quality custom-made systems--heralded what has perhaps been the company's crowning achievement: an early exploitation of the Internet. One of the first companies to actually make money online, Dell is now selling more than $12 million worth of systems per day over www.dell.com.  Not just for CEOs or those in high tech, the strategies revealed in Direct From Dell are invaluable to managers in a broad cross section of industries. From starting a successful business to pioneering computer sales and service over the Internet, Dell shares his perspectives on:  Why it's infinitely better for any business starting out to have too little capital, rather than too much  How studying your customers--not your competition--will give you a greater competitive edge  Why it can be life-threatening to your company to pursue too many good ideas--or to grow too fast  Why it's essential to run a P&L on every area of your business  Why your people prose a greater threat to the health of your business than your competition does  How you can exploit your competition's weakness by exposing its greatest strength  How integrating your business virtually can make the difference between being quick--and being dead  Revealing nothing less than a new model for doing business in the information age, Direct From Dell is both an extraordinary business success story and a manifesto for revolutionizing any industry.",

        "Title": "Along the Inca Road: A Woman's Journey into an Ancient Empire (Adventure Press)",
        "Authors": "By Muller, Karin",
        "Description": "One of the engineering wonders of the world, the Inca Road was built more than five hundred years ago to link the far-flung outposts of a fabled empire -- an empire that ruled in golden splendor until the conquistadors arrived to plunder El Dorado and put a swift, cruel end to its extraordinary culture. But its legend survives in the masterful masonry of its paving blocks and the ruined glory of ghost cities such as Cuzco. In this vivid, free-wheeling expedition, Karin Muller travels the ancient route to explore its dramatic history and discover new adventures along its length and breadth.  Along the Inca Road shares the stillness of sunrise in the haunted aerie of Machu Picchu, clings to the roof of a rattletrap bus skirting the vertiginous precipices of the Andes, carouses through the streets of an Altiplano city on Carnival, and inches warily forward as Ecuadorian soldiers probe for land mines with bayonets. Muller's ready for just about anything, whether it's challenging the Pacific surf in a traditional Inca reed boat, locking horns with a bull in a cheering Peruvian arena, or joining a crack Bolivian anti-narcotics team on a hunt for clandestine cocaine labs deep in the jungle. She initiates us into the mysteries of the spirits at a shaman's rite involving hamsters, hallucinogens, and copious libations of moonshine, and high in a mountain meadow captures a struggling vicuna, whose prized silky fleece once was reserved for the Inca god-king alone. And these are only a few of the traveler's tales from a 3,125-mile odyssey encompassing four countries and every form of transportation under the sun, from footslogging, mule train, and motorbike to state-of-the-art military vehicles.  As she spins the wool of her stories into a modern tapestry of faces and memories, Muller intertwines a chronicle of the ancient Inca from their race's mythical birth on an island in lofty Lake Titicaca to their sudden plunge from the height of imperial power at the hands of a ragtag band of Spanish soldiers of fortune. We learn how they lived, worshipped, and warred, and why such a magnificent culture proved so vulnerable to invaders.  As spectacular as the mountainscapes that are its breathtaking backdrop, Along the Inca Road is a wonderful panorama of past and present -- the kind of sharply observed portrait of a unique part of the world and its colorful people that displays the art of travel literature at its best.",

After successfully helping hundreds of thousands of people take responsibility for their own actions, Dr. Phil McGraw now turns his expertise to the primary area of concern troubling most people: their relationships. In his tell-it-like-it-is style that already has influenced millions of Oprah viewers, \"Dr. Phil\" blows the whistle on the rhetoric of traditional \"couples therapy\" and instead tells you that--no matter what state your relationship is in--not only are you responsible for it, you are responsible for getting it back on track. By doing this, he offers readers the chance for further happiness through meaningful, fulfilling relationships that work. Dr. Phil McGraw sets the record straight on the most popular myths about what a good relationship is supposed to be, such as:  Myth #1: A great relationship depends on a great meeting of the minds Myth #6: A great relationship lets you vent all your feelings Myth #7: A great relationship has nothing to do with sex",

She first ruled jointly with her brothers/husbands Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV, but her romantic liaisons with two of the most famous Romans of their day ensured Cleopatra's undying fame and place in history. Her relationship with Julius Caesar established her firmly upon the throne. When Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March in 44 B.C., Cleopatra returned from Rome to Egypt and began an ill-fated love affair with the brilliant but self-indulgent Roman commander, Marc Antony. Their relationship was bitterly opposed by his brother-in-law Octavian (who became Emperor Augustus), and in 32 B.C. Rome declared war on Egypt. A decisive naval defeat at the Battle of Actium, off the west coast of Greece, sent the lovers back to Egypt where they committed suicide as Octavian captured the city - Cleopatra allegedly killing herself with an asp after Antony fell upon his sword.",

So Gwen Woodleaf is surprised when her daughter announces that a frat party will keep them up late that evening. \"The school is banning men-only fraternities next term,\" Donna explains, \"so it's the last chance to get the experience of it.\"The \"experience,\" however, turns out to be a great deal more than the young women bargained for: the youth who drives Donna home on his motorcycle is found dead on the Woodleaf-LeBlancs' grounds the next morning. It is unclear how the young man, who had more than his share of alcohol the night before, died, and the police are asking questions.To some of the local people, the family is suspect to start with. Russell, Donna's father, is part Abenaki and an actor who gets himself up in full Native American regalia and plays an eighteenth-century brave in frequent Revolutionary War reenactments. His wife, Gwen, has inherited Woodleaf Apiaries from her beekeeper father-- at least two hundred hives scattered about the New England countryside, requiring skill and attention if the honey crop is to bring in any money. Gwen is also the subject of gossip because she grows marijuana and belladonna for medicinal purposes.Shep Noble's death begins to seem more and more like murder than accident, and his death and the LeBlancs' \"differentness\" incite anonymous threats and harassment from local troublemakers who make Donna's life miserable.Desperate, she turns to a neighbor, and Emily's mother, Ruth Willmarth, as so many others of the community have done in the past. Ruth, abandoned by her husband, is struggling to raise their children and keep her farm going with little help and even less income. But that doesn't stop her from doing what she can to comfort Donna. She urges her persistent suitor, Colm Hanna, a funeral director and part-time police officer, to go more deeply into the mystery of Shep's death than his police colleagues are doing.Meanwhile, Donna is researching a paper for her sociology class, weaving it around the story of her Vermont family, with its Native American and French Canadian roots. But tragedy dogs her when her sociology professor is strangled. As Ruth and Colm try to unravel the tangle of the two deaths, it becomes clear that both deaths, as well as the family history Donna is digging into, are coming together in a clashing climax that will leave none of the players unchanged.",

Yet despite the fact that Hispanics are the fastest-growing population in America, very few resources address their special health needs.   Salud! is the first comprehensive reader-friendly health guide specifically designed with the Hispanic woman in mind. The first part of the book examines the problems Latinas often face in the new health care system, arming them with the real-life strategies they need to overcome them. Part two looks at female health problems from a Hispanic perspective, offering expert advice and the most up-to-date findings. Part three covers the diseases and disorders to which Latinas are especially vulnerable, and part four focuses on helping them maintain their health and achieve overall wellness.  Sensitively written by a Latina health care professional and featuring a combination of state-of-the-art medicine, advice, and anecdotes from Latinas, Salud! emphasizes a practical approach to staying healthy that is geared to Hispanic tastes and values. It is the guide the Latina community has been waiting for.",

Committed to various mental institutions by her family, at sixteen Anna was finally able to escape her chaotic home life and enter a foster home. As an effort toward recovery and self-affirmation as well as a powerful plea on behalf of other abused children, Anna wrote this memoir while the experience was fresh and the emotions were still raw and unhealed. Her story is a powerful tale of survival.\"A teen's raw, in-your-face chronicle of events almost as they were happening. As such, it's unforgettable. . . .

So are the best wiretaps FBI money can buy. * Skinny Al weighed 320 pounds and lived life to the fullest...until someone burned out his eardrums and shot his body full of holes. Hundreds of writers have tried to capture life inside the mob, but no one has ever had the inside access to write a book like this one. Drawing on the firsthand experience of former undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone-aka Donnie Brasco-as well as former Mafia prince Bill Bonanno, The Good Guys straddles both sides of the law, races relentlessly through the New York City underworld, and crackles with characters and moments so vivid they will never let you go. At Columbia University, a professor of Russian literature has gone missing. A few miles and light-years away, Little Eddie LaRocca and Bobby San Filippo are on the move-dealing in everything from hot-sheet hotels to bootleg Fuji film. When the hoods are sent to find the professor, they find out that someone else is looking, too. Beautiful FBI agent Laura Russo is making her preppy partner's head spin. She knows the missing man is important-and somehow connected to a recent mob hit. While Eddie and Bobby are fighting their way through ugly deeds and pretty coeds, these feds will cook up some business of their own, turning a little disagreement among criminals into an all-out war... Capturing the organized crime world of the go-go '80s, Pistone and Bonanno's one-of-a-kind collaboration is bad to the bone-and as marvelously authentic as it gets.",

Just when it seems the children are gone for good, a team of misfit mercenaries-Groan, a buck-toothed Giant, Gordo, a wise-cracking dwarf, and Tambor, a has-been sorcerer-set out on a bumbling journey to stop Diek, and save the children. But will they be too late?",
