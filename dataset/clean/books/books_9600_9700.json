        "Authors": "By Matthiessen, Peter",
        "Description": "African Silences is a powerful and sobering account of the cataclysmic depredation of the African landscape and its wildlife. In this critically acclaimed work Peter Matthiessen explores new terrain on a continent he has written about in two previous books, A Tree Where Man Was Born -- nominated for the National Book Award -- and Sand Rivers.Through his eyes we see elephants, white rhinos, gorillas, and other endangered creatures of the wild. We share the drama of the journeys themselves, including a hazardous crossing of the continent in a light plane. And along the way, we learn of the human lives oppressed by bankrupt political regimes and economies, and threatened by the slow ecological catastrophe to which they have only begun to awaken.From the Trade Paperback edition.",

        "Title": "Truth To Tell: Tell It Early, Tell It All, Tell It Yourself: Notes from My White House Education",
        "Authors": "By Davis, Lanny J.",
        "Description": "On a November afternoon in 1996, Lanny Davis got a phone call that would change his life. It was from a top aide at the White House, asking him if he was interested in joining the president's senior staff. Within a few short weeks he had signed on as special counsel to the president. Fourteen months later, his tour of duty almost over, he got another phone call, this time from a Washington Post reporter who asked, \"Have you ever heard the name Monica Lewinsky?\"  In the time between those two phone calls, Davis received an extraordinary political education. As President Bill Clinton's chief spokesman for handling \"scandal matters\" he had the unenviable job of briefing reporters and answering their pointed questions on the most embarrassing allegations against the president and his aides, from charges of renting out the Lincoln Bedroom, to stories of selling plots in Arlington Cemetery, from irregular campaign fundraising to sexual improprieties. He was the White House's first line of defense against the press corps and the reporters' first point of entry to an increasingly reticent administration. His delicate task was to remain credible to both sides while surviving the inevitable crossfire.  Upon entering the White House, Davis discovered that he was never going to be able to turn bad news into good news, but he could place the bad news in its proper context and work with reporters to present a fuller picture. While some in the White House grew increasingly leery of helping a press corps that they regarded as hostile, Davis moved in the opposite direction, pitching unfavorable stories to reporters and helping them garner the facts to write those stories accurately. Most surprisingly of all, he realized that to do his job properly, he sometimes had to turn himself into a reporter within the White House, interviewing his colleagues and ferreting out information. Along the way, he learned the true lessons of why politicians, lawyers, and reporters so often act at cross-purposes and gained some remarkable and counterintuitive insights into why this need not be the case. Searching out the facts wherever he could find them, even if he had to proceed covertly, Davis discovered that he could simultaneously help the reporters do their jobs and not put the president in legal or political jeopardy.  With refreshing candor, Davis admits his own mistakes and reveals those instances where he dug a deeper hole for himself by denying the obvious and obfuscating the truth. And in a powerful reassessment of the scandal that led to the president's impeachment, Davis suggests that if the White House had been more receptive to these same hard-won lessons, the Monica Lewinsky story might not have come so close to bringing down an otherwise popular president. For as Davis learned above all, you can always make a bad story better by telling it early, telling it all, and telling it yourself.",

        "Description": "Instead of entering the world crying like other babies, Jubilo was born with a smile on his face. He had a gift for hearing what was in people's hearts, for listening to sand dunes sing and insects whisper. Even as a young boy, acting as an interpreter between his warring Mayan grandmother and his Spanish-speaking mother, he would translate words of spite into words of respect, so that their mutual hatred turned to love. When he grew up, he put his gift to good use in his job as a humble telegraph operator.But now the telegraph lies abandoned, obsolete as a form of communication in the electronic age and don Jubilo is on his deathbed, mute and estranged from his beloved wife, Lucha, who refuses to speak to him. What tragic event has come between two such sensuous, loving people to cause their seemingly irreparable rift? What mystery lies behind the death of the son no one ever mentions? Can their daughter bring reconciliation to her parents before it is too late, by acting as an interpreter between them, just as Jubilo used to do for other people?",

        "Title": "Red, White, and Oh So Blue: A Memoir of a Political Depression",
        "Authors": "By Blakely, Mary Kay",
        "Description": "Red, White, and Oh So Blue is a personal essay addressed to compassionate readers who feel traumatized by the news. Blakely identifies our national dependency on the \"quick fix\" habit - that of electing politicians who promise pain-free solutions and then wait for miracles - as another symptom of the disorder. Genuine relief from the political blues depends on thoughtful citizens reviewing every existing assumption about how we do business, raise children, respond to threats, educate ourselves, and treat our poor.Although the silent majority may feel powerless to effect change, Blakely points out we are in fact the largest and most influential constituency. Instead of separating from each other and establishing more distance from depressing realities, as conventional therapy directs us to do, Blakely urges the politically depressed to recognize our connectedness, despite \"national press that routinely frames the news in a 'conflict construct' and divides America into opposing sides of Us and Them.\"While Blakely reveals disturbing truths about how our political, military, business, family, and religious practices have compromised national life today, she also draws inspiration from the social justice movements of our past. With her usual candor, humor, and irreverence, she takes us on a thoroughly American journey and applies the talking cure to the silent majority. In the end, she restores readers' faith that \"we Americans\" could eventually become \"the country we promised to be, a republic we all could stand.\"",

He's tasted tragedy, but counted himself Still Among the Living, and found out the hard way that his business takes a Two Way Toll. He watches too much latenight TV, smokes too many cigarettes, and thinks too much for his own good. Sometimes high, often down, but never out, Matt Jacob is a survivor.Maybe that's what draws him to his latest assignment - penetrating the fiercely private world of an embattled Hasidic Jewish sect. In the midst of a holy celebration, a powerful and beloved rabbi is gunned down by the ringleader of a white supremacist hate group - who in turn is shot dead by another rabbi. To help attorney and friend Simon Roth defend the volatile Rabbi Yonah Saperstein, Matt agrees to ferret out the first-hand facts in the double slaying. It's a mission that plunges the streetwise P.I. into places even he's never been - where intruders are not suffered easily, and troublemakers suffer the consequences.Amid the Hasidim, Matt finds a people with a rage to survive. Among the White Avengers, he finds only rage. Though the battle lines are clearly drawn, Matt's moral compass detects a blurring of the lines between good and evil, right and wrong, justice and vigilantism, as he follows them into the hearts and minds of the warring groups' charismatic leaders.Complicating matters even more are Matt's friendship with Rabbi Saperstein's lonely, troubled son, his fondness for a brash young free-lance reporter working the same investigation, and his growing certainty that there's much more behind these murders than prejudice or passion. When Matt's good sense, and some very bad characters, tell him to stay away, Matt jumps in with both feet. But the forces he's going up against could take him out again...feet first.",

        "Description": "If anecdotes are marginal notes on the pages of history, these will delight any reader who has ever been moved or entertained by the condition of the soldier.  Few fields of human endeavor have inspired so many memorable anecdotes as warfare, from the Bible and Livy through Gibbon and Froissart, to the imperial wars of the nineteenth century and the world conflicts of the twentieth.    This collection of is principally concerned with American and British conflicts, with, as the author says, \"occasional forays among the ranks of foreign armies\"--notably the Greeks, the Romans, and Napoleon's veterans.  Hastings has sought stories that illustrate the military condition through the ages, both on the battlefield and in barracks: comic, eccentric, heroic, tragic.  Here are Caesar at the Rubicon and the revolt of the Praetorian Guard; Alexander's horse and Prince Rupert's dog; the legendary Mother Ross enlisting in search of her lost husband in 1693; Evelyn Waugh as the least plausible of commandos; General George S. Patton's good luck charm \"Charlie,\" a lump of lava rock carved into a Hawaiian warrior; and much more.  Some of the stories will be familiar to students of military history while others are less well known, but all provide fascinating sidelights to history.

The fifteen essays here collected\u2014several of them previously unpublished\u2014address themselves to the facets of the American consciousness and to their expression in literature from the time of the Cambridge Agreement to the Nobel Prize acceptance speeches of Hemingway and Faulkner. A companion volume to Errand into the Wilderness, its general theme is one adumbrated in Miller\u2019s two-volume masterpiece, The New England Mind\u2014the thrust of civilization into the vast, empty continent and its effect upon Americans\u2019 concept of themselves as \u201cnature\u2019s nation.\u201dThe essays first concentrate on Puritan covenant theology and its gradual adaptation to changing condition in America: the decline in zeal for a \u201cBible commonwealth,\u201d the growth of trade and industry, and the necessity for coexisting with large masses of unchurched people. As the book progresses, the emphasis shifts from religion to the philosophy of nature to the development of an original literature, although Miller is usually analyzing simultaneously all three aspects of the American quest for self-identity. In the final essays, he shows how the forces that molded the self-conscious articulateness of the early New Englanders still operate in the work of contemporary American writers.",

        "Description": "The Library of Alexandria, one of the wonders of the Ancient World, has haunted Western culture for over 2,000 years. The Ptolemaic kings of Egypt&#151;successors of Alexander the Great&#151;had a staggering ambition: to house all of the books ever written under one roof, and the story of the universal library and its destruction still has the power to move us.But what was the library, and where was it? Did it exist at all? Contemporary descriptions are vague and contradictory. The fate of the precious books themselves is a subject of endless speculation.Canfora resolves these puzzles in one of the most unusual books of classical history ever written. He recreates the world of Egypt and the Greeks in brief chapters that marry the craft of the novelist and the discipline of the historian. Anecdotes, conversations, and reconstructions give The Vanished Library the compulsion of an exotic tale, yet Canfora bases all of them on historical and literary sources, which he discusses with great panache. As the chilling conclusion to this elegant piece of historical detective work he establishes who burned the books.This volume has benefited from the collegial support of The Wake Forest University Studium.",

In Timeless Healing, Dr. Benson shows how affirming beliefs, particularly belief in a higher power, make a critical contribution to our physical health. In essence, Dr. Benson's message is that our bodies are wired for God.The key to Timeless Healing is what Dr. Benson calls remembered wellness - a concept that may revolutionize the way health care is practiced in the Western world. A Harvard physician who has conducted scientific research for thirty years, Dr. Benson explains how he became convinced that humans are genetically encoded with a need for and nourishment from faith. He documents that when people call upon faith, they activate neurologic pathways for self-healing. Detailing the scientific evidence, Dr. Benson clearly shows how anyone, along with a caring physician or healer, can tap into a reservoir of remembered wellness to affect and cure up to 90 percent of medical complaints.Acknowledging Western medicine's deficits when it comes to appreciating faith and the human spirit, Dr. Benson does not dismiss modern health care out of hand. Instead, he proposes practical ways in which patients and the medical community can make faith an integral part of health care, and he explores the merits of unconventional medicine. He proposes a balanced treatment approach drawing upon all components of health caremedications, medical procedures, and self-care that includes remembered wellness.",

        "Description": "Let&#39;s face it. In this chaotic world of teams, matrix management, and horizontal organizations, it&#39;s tougher than ever to get things done. How do you lead when you&#39;re not the one in charge? How can you be effective when joint action is needed? You need an edge in order to reach solutions and effectively work with others. Getting It DONE is your edge.Cowritten by Roger Fisher, an acknowledged authority on negotiation, Getting It DONE is the book to help you make things happen when you&#39;re not the boss. Fisher is the man who redefined the way the world negotiates with his megabestseller Getting to YES. Now he has teamed up with management consultant Alan Sharp to move beyond negotiation and give us the definitive book on collaboration. Introducing the technique of lateral leadership, Fisher and Sharp take collaboration to the next level and offer surefire ways to help anyone get better results from coworkers. Gleaned from their decades of experience as negotiators, mediators, and consultants to organizations, Getting It DONE  gives you the practical tools you need to influence your peers and bosses and get the results you seek.  Getting It DONE explains how you can best help a group formulate a clear vision of the results they want, suggest a course of action that you can all implement, and learn from past experiences. It describes how to ask questions effectively, offer ideas that will be heard, and influence the actions of others through your own behavior. The invaluable skills of lateral leadership enable you to achieve the ultimate goal--successful collaboration: Diagnose: identify the causes of a problem in order   to solve it Prescribe: create an approach that deals effectively    with differences Lead: engage others to implement the plan  A simple guide with profound impact, Getting It DONE will help people effectively manage themselves and others well into the twenty-first century.",

From these basic concepts he suggests a new ethic that sees power as the basis for both human goodness and evil.Dr. May discusses five levels of power's potential in each of us: the infant's power to be; self-affirmation, the ability to survive with self-esteem; self-assertion, which develops when self-affirmation is blocked; aggression, a reaction to thwarted assertion; and, finally, violence, when reason and persuasion are ineffective.",

        "Description": "For more than sixty years Alfred Kazin has been one of the most eloquent witnesses to the literary life of the mind in America. Writing Was Everything is a summation of that life, a story of coming of age as a writer and critic that is also a vibrant cultural drama teeming with such characters as Hart Crane and Allen Ginsberg, Simone Weil and Flannery O'Connor, Hannah Arendt and Robert Lowell, Edmund Wilson and George Orwell.A deft blend of autobiography, history, and criticism that moves from New York in the 1930s to wartime England to the postwar South, Writing Was Everything emerges as a reaffirmation of literature in an age of deconstruction and critical dogma. In his encounters with books, Kazin shows us how great writing matters and how it involves us morally, socially, and personally on the deepest level. Whether reflecting on modernism, southern fiction, or black, Jewish, and New Yorker writing or reliving the work of Richard Wright, Saul Bellow, and John Cheever, he gives a penetrating, moving account of literature observed and lived. In his life as a critic, Kazin personifies the lesson that living and writing are necessarily intimate.Writing Was Everything encapsulates the lively wit and authority of this timeless critic's unmistakable voice. It stands as clear testimony to Kazin's belief that \"literature is not theory but, at best, the value we can give to our experience, which in our century has been and remains beyond the imagination of mankind.\"",

Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and thereby exposes herself to the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love and family happiness. While previous versions have softened the robust and sometimes shocking qualities of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and Volokhonsky\u00a0have produced a translation true to his powerful voice. This authoritative edition, which received the PEN Translation Prize and was an Oprah Book Club\u2122 selection, also includes an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful, vigorous, and eminently readable, this Anna Karenina will be the definitive text for fans of the film and generations to come.\u00a0This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition also features French flaps and deckle-edged paper.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

As she grows from a rebellious adolescent in the preppy suburbs of Delaware to a sexually fraught and reluctant adult in New York City, Evie Wakefield struggles to connect and negotiate intimacy with the men in her life: Chas Wakefield, her larger-than-life father, who has cheated cancer for years; Billy, her sexy, responsibility--shy musician husband; and Charlie, her needy young son.All the while she attempts to keep up with her best friend and sometime competitor, the sophisticated and reckless Mary Beth McEvoy, who seems to draw to her just what she wants, and holds a mirror to Evie's darkest desires. Use Me vividly captures the undeniable truths of loyalty and betrayal, of heartbreak and sexual yearning, as evoked by a young writer of devastating gifts.Evie and Mary Beth: two women who could hardly be more different--or more deeply sympathetic. They could be the light and the dark in one person, but in fact they are best friends, occasional competitors, reflections of what's missing from each other's lives. Evie is emotionally articulate, painfully sensitive, and provoked by a desire to inhabit the hearts of those she loves most--her father, sick with cancer; her musician husband; her needful young son. Mary Beth is sharp, sophisticated, and utterly beguiling; the kind of woman who draws to her exactly what she desires (including, in one troubling evening, Evie's father). Perhaps calculated, but certainly careless with her friend's affections, Mary Beth makes her own life seem effortless. And for Evie, she serves as a reminder of the innocent sexual and emotional freedom she longs to recapture.As her father slips from her grasp, Evie falls into conflict with those she should be pulling close and tries to acknowledge her own weaknesses in the face of doing the right thing. What's revealed in these stories are the undeniable truths of loyalty and betrayal, of heartbreak and sexual yearning, evoked by a young writer of devastating gifts.Evie and Mary Beth: two women who could hardly be more different--or more deeply sympathetic.

        "Description": "Last season, CIA agent Jack Bauer, played by Golden Globe award-winning actor Keifer Sutherland, had us glued to our TVs and cursing the time clock as he uncovered a plot to assassinate presidential nominee, David Palmer. With just 24 hours to identify the killer, Bauer also had to deal with the kidnapping of his wife and daughter and the existence of a mole at the agency.    This season he's at it again, helping President David Palmer save Los Angeles from nuclear ravage.   Lest you think Jack had some down time between life-altering experiences, check out   24: The House Special Subcommittees Findings at CTU.

        "Description": "Neal Pollack has been the Greatest Living American Writer across six decades, seven continents, and ten wives. He has won the Pulitzer Prize, the Booker Prize, the PEN/Faulkner Award (twice), and the Premio Simon Bolivar for contributions to the people's struggle in Latin America. In 1985, Pollack's writing was declared \"beyond our meager standards\" by the Swedish Academy With the publication of The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature, the definitive collection of his work in English, a new generation of readers is set to discover nothing less than the ultimate meaning of human existence on earth. This astonishing work of fictitious nonfiction, the funniest and most creatively styled postmodernist confection of its time, has been universally praised as the best book ever written except for maybe Don Quixote and The Shipping News. The Anthology -- now expanded, updated, and thoroughly repaginated -- answers, once and for all, the question that has plagued American society in general, and literary critics in particular, since Neal Pollack was born: \"Who is Neal Pollack?\" At last, we know.",

        "Authors": "By Lehrer, Jim",
        "Description": "Charles Avenue Henderson claims to want nothing more than to relax in rural West Virginia with his beloved wife Mary Jane and live the genteel life of a successful bed-and-breakfast proprietor. But readers of Lehrer's Blue Hearts will know that Henderson can turn at the drop of a hat from the lovely dinners of Rappahannock oysters with sweet potatoes allumettes to his old tricks as a CIA agent whenever he or someone he cares about is in trouble. In Purple Dots, it is Henderson's longtime friend and CIA protege Joshua Bennett who is threatened by a group of senators seeking to derail his nomination as director of the CIA.  Purple Dots is both a page turning thriller and something of a spoof of the thriller genre. Henderson, our hero, gathers together all of his retired CIA friends in order to launch a counteroffensive against the senators and their efforts are sometimes ridiculously over the top. As with Blue Hearts and the Last Debate, Lehrer takes the reader on another tour of Washington with all of its vanities and local curiosities exposed. And the search for the famous and mysterious purple dot, the ultimate Washington perk, continues....",

        "Description": "Neil Baldwin's Edison: Inventing the Century is the first biography of one of the seminal figures in our history to examine him as both myth and man, assessing his remarkable accomplishments while taking thorough measure of the paradoxes of his character. Drawing upon unprecedented access to Edison family papers and years of research at the Edison corporate archives, Baldwin offers a revealing portrait of the inventor, in which we discover a man whose life epitomized the American dream as fully as he became a victim of its darker side. From his years as a fragile boy hawking newspapers on trains throughout the Midwest to his arrival in New York City as an itinerant telegrapher seeking his fortune; from his development of the light bulb to his spectacular electrification of lower Manhattan; from his struggles to create the phonograph and motion picture and bring them to market to his obsessive search for a source of natural rubber even as he was dying, Edison: Inventing the Century is an enthralling chronicle of the most revered figure of his time.Alongside the esteemed scientist stands the fiercely self-aggrandizing manufacturer of his own myth; the man possessed by a virtually incessant flow of ideas, who often fights brutally to protect those ideas in the marketplace; the man who publicly preaches the values of home life while his own family is plagued by clinical depression and alcoholism, and while his six neglected, aimless children from two marriages try to step from his massive shadow, yet prove, almost inevitably, to be a disappointment.",

        "Title": "Goddesses in Everywoman: A New Psychology of Women",
        "Authors": "By Bolen, Jean Shinoda",
        "Description": "Just as women used to be unconscious of the powerful effects that cultural stereotypes had on them, they may also be unconscious of powerful forces within them that influence what they do and how they feel, and which account for major differences among women. Psychoanalyst Jean Bolen believes that an understanding of these inner patterns and their interrelationships offers reassuring, true-to-life alternatives that take women far beyond such restrictive dichotomies as masculine/feminine, mother/lover, careerist/housewife. And she demonstrates how understanding them can provide the key to self-knowledge and wholeness. Dr. Bolen introduces these patterns in the guise of seven archetypal goddesses, or personality types, with whom all women will identify. Goddesses in Everywoman shows readers how to identify their ruling goddesses (from the autonomous Artemis and the cool Athena to the nurturing Demeter and the creative Aphrodite), how to decide which to cultivate and which to overcome, and how to tap the power of these enduring archetypes to become better \"heroines\" in their own life stories.",
