We talked about our kids, and our careers and the state of America, just two lucky guys who loved each other and the good luck of our careers.Ed McMahon is the only person who was with Johnny Carson, even before The Tonight Show, when they both first appeared on Who Do You Trust. Now, with Johnny's blessing before he died, McMahon can finally share all the stories that only he knows. From the sofa at Johnny's right, to backstage, to their personal relationship - McMahon will provide a real view of the man who was so careful to only show one side of himself to the public. Brilliant in front of the camera, but shy in person, Carson seldom gave interviews. Only McMahon can tell the stories and provide the insights into the personality that made Johnny Carson more of a friend we invited into our home than a television star.This entertaining tribute will feature over 200 pictures, many never before published, from both McMahon's and Carson's private archives.",

        "Description": "New York Times bestselling author Linda Lael Miller turns up the heat in this sizzling tale of suspense and re-kindled passions set against the blazing skies of Arizona's lush desert landscape -- where a killer is determined to exact his revenge. When hard-working attorney Clare Westbrook learns that her ambulance-chasing boss has been murdered, she's shocked -- but not exactly surprised. Harvey Kredd was known for his less-than-ethical business dealings, and even his acts of generosity were tinged with greed; Clare, working at Kredd and Associates to pay off the law school loan Harvey had granted her several years before, knows she's got no choice: indentured servitude, twenty-first-century style.  But Harvey's death doesn't let Clare out of her contract with the firm; instead it brings her a new, odious multimillionaire client, and Tony Sonterra, homicide detective and local heartthrob, who's not above using a murder investigation to get back into Clare's life. Jump-starting her affair with Tony is the last thing Clare needs -- she's got enough on her plate raising her niece, Emma, without throwing a bull-headed cop into the mix.  Then Clare gets the news that may convince her Tony is exactly what she needs: Emma's father has been released from prison, and he's intent on seeing his daughter. Though she could never persuade the police to believe her, Clare is convinced that James Arren murdered her sister.  Clare is determined to find evidence that will put James Arren away for good, but Tony is just as determined to keep her safe, after another murder -- clearly meant to target Clare -- rocks the law firm. With no real leads, too many suspects, and a growing chain of menacing violence, Clare finds that teaming up with the devil she knows is her only option -- one that's just too attractive to resist.  With the same rich storytelling style that has captivated readers worldwide, Linda Lael Miller delivers a page-turning blend of heated passion and captivating suspense.",

Sufferers know firsthand the confusion and agony these illnesses can bring. They also know how it feels to long for hope\u2013and to wonder if victory can ever be achieved.

        "Description": "The year is 1931 and Lucy Richards Arnold - mother to a demandingly precocious four-year-old son - is in rural West Texas, teaching in the school where her husband, Josh, is principal. While trying to win over a community that seems to have little respect for formal education, Lucy and Josh are also struggling to make a success of their neglected farm during a drought and the bleak hard times of the Great Depression.Out of this barren landscape rich and colorful characters emerge as if from a fertile land: above all there is Josh, impulsive and contemplative, passionate and wise, who loves in ways few men are capable of loving and whose only fear is losing Lucy; there is Meg, a fifteen-year-old, who is able to hear the grass grow and smell out rattlers and whose ardent heart and natural wisdom are focused solely on keeping her small charge, John Patrick, safe; there is Mueller, who had always wanted to \"look in a book and know what was in it\" and who had hoped his sons would take a liking to the new principal; there is Bud Foster, a down-and-out cowboy who knows that \"sometimes a man has to go on down the road and find something\"; and there is Miriah, with a magic all her own, who waits confidently for her husband to return from the arms of another woman.Before the year's end, Lucy is faced with a loss of such magnitude that she must struggle to find a way to recapture the joy in her very existence.With the same wry sense of humor and tender but never sentimental touch that captivated readers of the first two best-selling books in the trilogy, The Train to Estelline and A Place Called Sweet Shrub, Jane Roberts Wood's Dance a Little Longer delivers what the title promises - a dance of the heart. It is Jane Roberts Wood at her finest.",

From the opening sentence to the very last word, Hairstyles of the Damned held me in his grip.\"--Jim DeRogatis, pop music critic, Chicago Sun-Times\"The most authentic young voice since J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield...A darn good book.\"--Daily Southtown\"Sensitive, well-observed, often laugh-out-loud funny...You won't regret a moment of the journey.\"--Chicago Tribune\"Meno is a romantic at heart. Not the greeting card kind, or the Harlequin paperback version, but the type who thinks, deep down, that things matter, that art can change lives.\"--Elgin Courier News\"Funny and charming and sad and real. The adults are sparingly yet poignantly drawn, especially the fathers, who slip through without saying much but make a profound impression.\"--Chicago Journal\"Underneath his angst, Brian, the narrator of Hairstyles of the Damned, possesses a disarming sense of compassion which allows him to worm his way into the reader's heart. It is this simple contradiction that makes Meno's portrait of adolescence so convincing: He has dug up and displayed for us the secret paradox of the teenage years, the desire to belong pitted against the need for individuality--a constant clash of hate and love.\"--NewPages.com\"Joe Meno knows Chicago's south side the way Jane Goodall knew chimps and apes--which is to say, he really knows it. He also knows about the early '90s, punk rock, and awkward adolescence. Best of all, he knows the value of entertainment. Hairstyles of the Damned is proof positive.\"--John McNally, author of The Book of Ralph\"Filled with references to dozens of bands and mix-tape set lists, the book's heart and soul is driven by a teenager's life-changing discovery of punk's social and political message...Meno's alter ego, Brian Oswald, is a modern-day Holden Caulfield...It's a funny, sweet, and, at times, hard-hitting story with a punk vibe.\"--Mary Houlihan, Chicago Sun-Times\"Meno's language is rhythmic and honest, expressing things proper English never could. And you've got to hand it to the author, who pulled off a very good trick: The book is punk rock. It's not just punk rock. It's not just about punk rock; it embodies the idea of punk rock; it embodies the idea of punk--it's pissed off at authority, it won't groom itself properly, and it irritates. Yet its rebellious spirit is inspiring and right on the mark.\"--SF WeeklyHairstyles of the Damned is the debut novel of our Punk Planet Books imprint, which originates from Punk Planet magazine.Hairstyles of the Damned is an honest, true-life depiction of growing up punk on Chicago's south side: a study in the demons of racial intolerance, Catholic school conformism, and class repression. It is the story of the riotous exploits of Brian, a high school burnout, and his best friend, Gretchen, a punk rock girl fond of brawling. Based on the actual events surrounding a Chicago high school's segregated prom, this work of fiction unflinchingly pursues the truth in discovering what it means to be your own person.",

When her mom started telling everyone about the messages aliens were sending through a mole on the back of her neck?

Or when the Boov declared Earth a colony, renamed it \u201cSmekland\u201d (in honor of glorious Captain Smek), and forced all Americans to relocate to Florida via rocketpod? \u00a0In any case, Gratuity's story is much, much bigger than the assignment.

Just as she is wondering how she will survive, she comes upon an old lady with a very sad story: a dog has run off with her walking stick, and she can\u2019t do a thing without it. When the old lady promises Margaret a reward of three gold coins for its safe return, the girl readily agrees. Little does Margaret know that the old lady is really a witch, her reward a trick, and her walking stick a magic stick the witch has used to make a thousand miserable wishes come true . . .",

How can the fourth and fifth fingers be strengthened? What produces musicianship? These and many others are perennial questions of the greatest practical importance to student, teacher, and performer. Strange, then, that adequate answers are so hard to find. With all the time and effort devoted to the study of the piano, with all the advances in the psychology of training, with all the special studies that have been conducted, there should be, by now, if not one right answer to each question, at least a preferred answer that will be right for the large majority of pianists. As a matter of fact, there are preferred answers in almost every instance. . . . The need is to bring these answers together, in one place, and to present them in nontechnical language as a concise, up-to-date, coordinated philosophy of piano playing. To meet this need, the present book has been written.\"-from the Preface",

Its 20,000 inhabitants lived in the shadow of Vesuvius, which they believed was nothing more than a mountain. But Vesuvius was a volcano. And on the morning of August 24, A.D. 79, Vesuvius began to erupt. Within twenty-four hours, the entire city of Pompeii\u2014and many of its citizens\u2014had been utterly annihilated.It was not until hundreds of years later that Pompeii saw daylight again, as archaeological excavations began to unearth what had been buried under layers of volcanic rubble. Digging crews expected to find buildings and jewelry and other treasures, but they found something unexpected, too: the imprints of lost Pompeiians, their deaths captured as if by photographic images in volcanic ash.",

That power has been wielded like never before for partisan gain: to win current and future elections for Republicans across America. The Democrats had everything going for them in the 2006 election, but all the obstacles Republicans have been constructing paid off by denying them an even bigger win. Democrats are confident going into 2008, but the Republican advantages endure. Through a rigorous examination of the GOP machine, this book reveals how a true Democratic resurgence faces steep barriers--barriers erected by conservatives who have worked to build their dominant position since the days of Barry Goldwater.\"Incisive journalistic digging...One Party Country does a good job of spelling out the GOP electoral strategy objectively and in detail.\"--The Christian Science Monitor",
