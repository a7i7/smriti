        "Title": "The Rise of Global Civil Society: Building Communities and Nations from the Bottom Up",
        "Authors": "By Eberly, Don",
        "Description": "Global news is generally bad news. On the surface, the story is about war, poverty, ethnic and sectarian strife. Democracy movements advanced by the U.S. government seem to be stalled or even reversed. Yet just below the surface, more hopeful trends are brewing. A new global awareness of the people at \"the bottom of the pyramid\" is summoning forth an unprecedented response to human need and suffering. It involves a shift from vertical to horizontal power that official aid agencies are only beginning to comprehend. Whereas twenty-five years ago, government aid accounted for 70 percent of all American outflows, today 85 percent of all outflows of resources come from private individuals, businesses, religious congregations, universities, and immigrant communities. If aid policy in the twentieth century relied on top-down bureaucracy dominated by policy specialists and elites, the twenty-first century is shaping up as an era in which citizens, social entrepreneurs, and volunteers link up to solve problems. U.S. military and economic power are basic components of America's presence in the world; but in an environment of rampant anti-Americanism, it is compassion that is America's most consequential export. Civil society, once the distinctive characteristic of American democracy, is now advancing across the globe, carrying with it new forms of philanthropy, citizenship, and volunteerism. Tens of thousands of voluntary associations are prying open closed societies from within, solving problems in new ways, and forming the seedbed for a long-term cultivation of democratic norms. Building Nations from the Bottom Up: The Global Rise of Democratic Society presents a sweeping overview of the forces now shaping the global debate, including citizen-led development projects, poverty-reduction strategies that substitute opportunity for charity, and electronically linked movements to combat corruption and autocratic rule.",

        "Description": "Richard Peck is a master of stories about people in transition, but perhaps never before has he told a tale of such dramatic change as this one, set during the first year of the Civil War. The whole country is changing in 1861-even the folks from a muddy little Illinois settlement on the banks of the Mississippi. Here, fifteen-year-old Tilly Pruitt frets over the fact that her brother is dreaming of being a soldier and that her sister is prone to supernatural visions. A boy named Curry could possibly become a distraction. Then a steamboat whistle splits the air. The Rob Roy from New Orleans docks at the landing, and off the boat step two remarkable figures: a vibrant, commanding young lady in a rustling hoop skirt and a darker, silent woman in a plain cloak, with a bandanna wrapped around her head. Who are these two fascinating strangers? And is the darker woman a slave, standing now on the free soil of Illinois? When Tilly's mother invites the women to board at her house, the whole world shifts for the Pruitts and for their visitors as well. Within a page-turning tale of mystery, adventure, and the civilian Civil War experience, Richard Peck has spun a breathtaking portrait of the lifelong impact that one person can have on another. This is a novel of countless riches.",

The seduction of God\u2019s people by the deceiver is a tale as old as the garden, but we are always surprised when it happens. We must realize that Satan is a lion on the prowl and we are his prey.  Beth writes with a passion fueled by the Biblical warnings of the schemes of Satan\u2019s seductive activity and the broken-hearted concern of a teacher who receives countless letters from repentant Christians limping on the road to finding restoration. Delivering dire warnings to Christians to safeguard themselves against Satan\u2019s attacks, Beth also reveals how you can know if someone is vulnerable. Beth writes, \u201cWe, Christ\u2019s church, are in desperate need of developing His heart and mind in issues like these.\u201d She fears that often God is far more merciful than the Body of Christ is with the deeply repentant and those desperate to find their way home.

        "Description": "He played in casinos around the world with a plan to make himself richer than anyone could possibly imagine -- but it would nearly cost him his life.Semyon Dukach was known as the Darling of Las Vegas. A legend at age twenty-one, this cocky hotshot was the biggest high roller to appear in Sin City in decades, a mathematical genius with a system the casinos had never seen before and couldn't stop -- a system that has never been revealed until now; that has nothing to do with card counting, wasn't illegal, and was more powerful than anything that had been tried before.Las Vegas. Atlantic City. Aruba. Barcelona. London. And the jewel of the gambling crown -- Monte Carlo.Dukach and his fellow MIT students hit them all and made millions. They came in hard, with stacks of cash; big, seemingly insane bets; women hanging on their arms; and fake identities. Although they were taking classes and studying for exams during the week, over the weekends they stormed the blackjack tables only to be harassed, banned from casinos, threatened at gunpoint, and beaten in Vegas's notorious back rooms.The stakes were high, the dangers very real, but the players were up to the challenges, consequences be damned. There was Semyon Dukach himself, bored with school and broke; Victor Cassius, the slick, brilliant MIT grad student who galvanized the team; Owen Keller, with stunning ability but a dark past that would catch up to him; and Allie Simpson, bright, clever, and a feast for the eyes.In the classroom, they were geeks. On the casino floor, they were unstoppable.Busting Vega$ is Dukach's unbelievably true story; a riveting account of monumental greed, excess, hubris, sex, love, violence, fear, and statistics that is high-stakes entertainment at its best.",

        "Description": "A fascinating study of the world\u2019s great myths and their impact on the creative arts through the ages, this insightful and absorbing book demonstrates the dynamic effect that ancient mythology has had on the creative efforts of succeeding centuries. Distinguished historian and classical scholar Michael Grant summarizes all the myths as well as the legends of the lesser gods and heroes, and traces their origins in historical fact or religious myth. He then shows how myths have continued to evolve throughout the ages. The author\u2019s brilliant investigations lead from Pericles to Picasso, Homer to Freud, Apuleius to Grimm\u2014and prove that mythological themes have been continuously restated in art, science, and folklore, up to the present day. Lively and fascinating, this in-depth study is complemented by maps, genealogical tables, and 64 pages of photographs. Included, too, are an appendix on additional myths, chapter notes, and an updated bibliography and index. \u201cThe special value of the book lies in [its] studies of the earlier and later history of the myths . . . . The study of origins takes Mr. Grant into many different fields, including archaeology and psychology as well as classical philology. He is well read and sure footed in all of them.\u201d\u2014London Times Literary Supplement",

        "Description": "\"Sweet spot.\" Golfers understand the term. So do tennis players. Ever swung a baseball bat or paddled a Ping-Pong ball? If so, you know the oh-so-nice feel of the sweet spot. Life in the sweet spot rolls like the downhill side of a downwind bike ride. But you don't have to swing a bat or a club to know this. What engineers give sports equipment, God gave you.A zone, a region, a life precinct in which you were made to dwell. He tailored the curves of your life to fit an empty space in his jigsaw puzzle. And life makes sweet sense when you find your spot. But if you're like 87 percent of workers, you haven't found it. You don't find meaning in your work--or you're one of the 80 percent who don't believe their talents are used. What can you do? You're suffering from the common life, and you desperately need a cure.Best-selling author Max Lucado has found it. In Cure for the Common Life he offers practical tools for exploring and identifying your own uniqueness, motivation to put your strengths to work, and the perfect prescription for finding and living in your sweet spot for the rest of your life.",

But Dooher, a prosperous attorney and prominent Catholic, is the first man San Francisco detective Abe Glitsky suspects.\u00a0\u00a0Soon Dooher is standing in the sights of the great, flawed machine called the criminal justice system.\u00a0\u00a0And Mark Dooher, a paragon of success and a master of all he touches, is about to be indicted for murder.As the Dooher trial begins, dozens of lives are drawn into the drama, from the men and women who knew Mark Dooher best to those whose fates are now entwined with his.\u00a0\u00a0For Wes Farrell, an attorney struggling with his own sense of failure, the defense of Mark Dooher will mean a chance at self-respect.\u00a0\u00a0For beautiful, aspiring attorney Christina Carrera, the case leads to a dangerous liaison with Dooher, who has wanted more than anything to have this woman by his side and in his bed.\u00a0\u00a0And for Abe Glitsky, whose wife is dying of cancer, the trial is a nightmare of DNA evidence, shaky witnesses, and long odds: Dooher, the unofficial consigliere of the Archbishop of San Francisco, has the Catholic Church on his side.As the trial builds to a crescendo, as evidence is sifted and witnesses discredited, as Farrell rises to heights he never knew he could reach and Abe Glitsky grieves, a woman emerges from Mark Dooher's past.\u00a0\u00a0Her story will change the role of nearly every player in this trial, and ignite a chain reaction of truth and violence that will alter lives forever.A novel that surprises from its first page to its last, Guilt is more than a story about crime and punishment.\u00a0\u00a0It is a riveting drama of moral responsibility and uncertain justice, of families bound by loyalty and divided by tragedy and betrayal.\u00a0\u00a0Building to one of the most nerve-shattering endings in recent fiction, Guilt is a true masterpiece of hard-hitting, contemporary suspense.",

        "Title": "Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero",
        "Authors": "By Montville, Leigh",
        "Description": "He was The Kid. The Splendid Splinter. Teddy Ballgame. One of the greatest figures of his generation, and arguably the greatest baseball hitter of all time.  But what made Ted Williams a legend \u2013 and a lightning rod for controversy in life and in death?  What motivated him to interrupt his Hall of Fame career twice to serve his country as a fighter pilot; to embrace his fans while tangling with the media; to retreat from the limelight whenever possible into his solitary love of fishing; and to become the most famous man ever to have his body cryogenically frozen after his death? New York Times bestselling author Leigh Montville, who wrote the celebrated Sports Illustrated obituary of Ted Williams, now delivers an intimate, riveting account of this extraordinary life. Still a gangly teenager when he stepped into a Boston Red Sox uniform in 1939, Williams\u2019s boisterous personality and penchant for towering home runs earned him adoring admirers--the fans--and venomous critics--the sportswriters.  In 1941, the entire country followed Williams's stunning .406 season, a record that has not been touched in over six decades. At the pinnacle of his prime, Williams left Boston to train and serve as a fighter pilot in World War II, missing three full years of baseball. He was back in 1946, dominating the sport alongside teammates Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Bobby Doerr. But Williams left baseball again in 1952 to fight in Korea, where he flew thirty-nine combat missions\u2014crash-landing his flaming, smoke-filled plane, in one famous episode.Ted Willams's personal life was equally colorful. His attraction to women (and their attraction to him) was a constant. He was married and divorced three times and he fathered two daughters and a son. He was one of corporate America's first modern spokesmen, and he remained, nearly into his eighties, a fiercely devoted fisherman.  With his son, John Henry Williams, he devoted his final years to the sports memorabilia business, even as illness overtook him.  And in death, controversy and public outcry followed Williams and the disagreements between his children over the decision to have his body preserved for future resuscitation in a cryonics facility--a fate, many argue, Williams never wanted. With unmatched verve and passion, and drawing upon hundreds of interviews, acclaimed best-selling author Leigh Montville brings to life Ted Williams's superb triumphs, lonely tragedies, and intensely colorful personality, in a biography that is fitting of an American hero and legend.",

For more than two decades, he has conferred with central bankers (such as Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke) and advised top Wall Street executives and investors, from George Soros to Michael Steinhardt to Stan Druckenmiller. Political leaders (from Bill Bradley to Jack Kemp) have regularly sought his policy advice. The World Is Curved picks up where Thomas Friedman\u2019s The World Is Flat left off, taking readers on an insider\u2019s tour through the private offices of central bankers, finance ministers, even prime ministers. Smick reveals how today\u2019s risky environment came to be?and why the mortgage mess is a symptom of potentially far more devastating trouble. He wrestles with the two questions on everyone\u2019s mind: How bad could things really get in today\u2019s volatile economy? And what can we do about it? Drawing on riveting anecdotes in language anyone can understand, Smick explains:         Why the churning cauldron we call China (the next great bubble to burst) represents a powerful threat to everyone\u2019s pocketbook        How Japanese housewives have taken control of their nation\u2019s savings, and why it matters to us        How greed-driven bankers and investment bankers have put everyone\u2019s pensions and 401(k)s at risk        Why today\u2019s ?incredible shrinking central banks\u201d may not be able to save us when the next crisis hits        Why the big-money Russian, Chinese, Saudi, and Dubai sovereign wealth funds represent a tectonic shift in global financial power, away from the United States, Europe, and Japan        Why the world desperately needs a ?big think\u201d financial doctrine to guide today\u2019s dangerous ocean of money  The World Is Curved is the rare book that speaks simultaneously to the Wall Street, Washington, and London elite, yet its apt storytelling shows Main Street readers how to survive in these turbulent times.",

From April 14 to April 26, 1865, the assassin, John Wilkes Booth, led Union cavalry and detectives on a wild twelve-day chase through the streets of Washington, D.C., across the swamps of Maryland, and into the forests of Virginia, while the nation, still reeling from the just-ended Civil War, watched in horror and sadness.James L. Swanson's Manhunt is a fascinating tale of murder, intrigue, and betrayal. A gripping hour-by-hour account told through the eyes of the hunted and the hunters, this is history as you've never read it before.",

        "Title": "Tales of the Field: On Writing Ethnography (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)",
        "Authors": "By Van Maanen, John",
        "Description": "Once upon a time ethnographers returning from the field simply sat down, shuffled their note cards, and wrote up their descriptions of the exotic and quaint customs they had observed. Today scholars in all disciplines are realizing how their research is presented is at least as important as what is presented. Questions of voice, style, and audience--the classic issues of rhetoric--have come to the forefront in academic circles.John Van Maanen, an experienced ethnographer of modern organizational structures, is one who believes that the real work begins when he returns to his office with cartons of notes and tapes. In Tales of the Field he offers readers a survey of the narrative conventions associated with writing about culture and an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various styles. He introduces first the matter-of-fact, realistic report of classical ethnography, then the self-absorbed confessional tale of the participant-observer, and finally the dramatic vignette of the new impressionistic style. He also considers, more briefly, literary tales, jointly told tales, and the theoretically focused formal and critical tales. Van Maanen illustrates his discussion of each style with excerpts from his own work on the police.Tales of the Field offers an informal, readable, and lighthearted treatment of the rhetorical devices used to present the results of fieldwork. Though Van Maanen argues ultimately for the validity of revealing the self while representing a culture, he is sensitive to the differing methods and aims of sociology and anthropology. His goal is not to establish one true way to write ethnography, but rather to make ethnographers of all varieties examine their assumptions about what constitutes a truthful cultural portrait and select consciously and carefully the voice most appropriate for their tales. Written with grace and humor, Tales of the Field will be an invaluable introduction to novices just learning the fieldwork trade and provocative stimulant to veteran ethnographers. \"Engaging and well written.\"--H.

        "Title": "Blood Diamonds: Tracing the Deadly Path of the World's Most Precious Stones",
        "Authors": "By Campbell, Greg",
        "Description": "First discovered in 1930, the diamonds of Sierra Leone have funded one of the most savage rebel campaigns in modern history. These \"blood diamonds\" are smuggled out of West Africa and sold to legitimate diamond merchants in London, Antwerp, and New York, often with the complicity of the international diamond industry. Eventually, these very diamonds find their way into the rings and necklaces of brides and spouses the world over. Blood Diamonds is the gripping tale of how the diamond smuggling works, how the rebel war has effectively destroyed Sierra Leone and its people, and how the policies of the diamond industry - institutionalized in the 1880s by the De Beers cartel - have allowed it to happen. Award-winning journalist Greg Campbell traces the deadly trail of these diamonds, many of which are brought to the world market by fanatical enemies. These repercussions of diamond smuggling are felt far beyond the borders of the poor and war-ridden country of Sierra Leone, and the consequences of overlooking this African tragedy are both shockingly deadly and unquestionably global.

Call me crotchety, but I can't help asking, whatever happened to the social contract?'The get-rich-quick exuberance of the late nineties may have temporarily blinded us to how dependent we are on one another. Subsequent events serve as reminders that the strength of our economy and the security of our society rest on the bonds that connect us. But what, specifically, are these bonds? What do we owe one another as members of the same society?With his characteristic humor, humanity, and candor, one of the nation's most distinguished public leaders and thinkers delivers a fresh vision of politics by returning to basic American values: workers should share in the success of their companies; those who work should not have to live in poverty; and everyone should have access to an education that will better their chances in life.An insider who knows how the economy and government really work, Reich combines realistic solutions with democratic ideals. Businesses do have civic responsibilities, and government must stem a widening income gap that threatens to stratify our nation. And everyone must get involved to help return us to a society that works for everyone.",

Bruce Knecht chronicles how an obscure fish merchant in California \"discovered\" and renamed the fish, kicking off a worldwide craze for a fish no one had ever heard of - and everyone had to have.  And with demand exploding, priates were only too happy to satisfy our taste for Chilean Sea Bass.  Knecht - whose previous book The Proving Ground was hailed by Walter Cronkite as  \"a sailing masterpiece...a tale more thrilling than fiction\"\u2014captivates readers by deftly shifting among the story's nail-biting elements: The perilous chase at sea through frenzied winds, punishing waves, and an obstacle course of icebergs; the high-stakes environmental battle and courtroom drama; and the competitive battle among the world's restaurants to serve the perfect, flaky, white-fleshed fish.From the world's most treacherous waters to its most fabulous kitchens, Hooked is at once a thrilling tale and a revelatory popular history that will appeal to a diverse group of readers.

The film has been seen as a celebration of American opportunity that, according to at least one leftist critic, \"inverts reality\" by depicting its subject matter as merely \"the bottom rung of an ever-ascending ladder of success\" during the Reagan era. This volume combines the screenplay with shots from the film, a variety of informational sidebars, and a conversation about the movie between Mr. Sheridan and Annette Insdorf, Columbia University's Director of Undergraduate Film Studies. Also included are brief biographies of the key film personnel and a full list of credits. Annotation (c) Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)",
