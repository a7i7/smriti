With a firm grasp on a biblical understanding of Israel\u2019s past, present and future, he turns a critical eye on the political and religious policies of the region\u2019s prime players, resorting neither to blind pro Israeli sentiment nor to reactionary pro Palestinian bias. Aikman challenges us to a uniquely Christian approach to the Middle East, respect, reason and love, rather than unqualified tolerance on the one hand or religious crusading on the other.",

She mourned her shattered hopes and grieved the loss of the family she had always dreamed of. But mostly, she cried for her children. Into Carol\u2019s grief, regret and fear, God\u2019s Spirit came with a message from Psalm 84: Build your nest near my altar, and I will be your children\u2019s source of security, protection, provision and blessing. In The Single Mom's Devotional, Carol tells her story and shares with the sisterhood of single moms how they can build their family\u2019s nest in the protective shadow of God\u2019s presence. Single mothers, whether on their own after a divorce or a husband\u2019s death, will discover how to find true life in Christ and allow the strength of that inner life to be the compass by which they navigate an unpredictable future. Near God\u2019s altar, the cross of Christ is where single moms will discover life through relinquishment, power through dependence and hope through surrender. Anchored at the foot of the cross, readers will find daily security and hope as they nourish their souls and nurture their children at a place near God\u2019s altar.",

As prophetic voices, Shane Claiborne and John Perkins lead the way in this move to be the hands, feet and heart of Jesus. One is young, a self proclaimed reformed redneck who grew up in the hills of Tennessee and now lives in inner city Philadelphia and the other is decades older, an African-American civil rights leader who was almost beaten to death by police in Mississippi, and went on to found a reconciliation movement and counsel three American presidents. Claiborne and Perkins draw on more than a century of combined following and learning, activating and leading. Together they craft a timely message for ordinary people willing to take radical steps to see real change happen. InFollow Me to Freedom, Claiborne and Perkins lead the way toward justice for all, unfolding a proven strategy as ancient as the patriarchs of faith and as fresh as the needs of every human heart. Starting with Moses as a model, they re-imagine leading and following in a world desperate for true social justice, compassion and freedom. They offer practical ways to internalize and live out God\u2019s promise of freedom in the twenty-first century.

        "Description": "The #1 Principle of Sustainable Business Success Is Simpler Than You Think      \u201cDo the Right Thing is about how any company can stay true to its soul. Jim Parker\u2019s deep and abiding belief in the power of people and culture in building a business of lasting worth is evident everywhere; so too is his humility and selflessness as a leader--his stories are not about his own achievements, which are many, but those of the people he led, one of the great success stories of our time.\u201d  --Sean Moriarty, CEO, Ticketmaster     \u201cDo the Right Thing offers insightful views into the culture, leadership, and decisions that build great companies the right way. A must read for my management team. THIS BOOK ROCKS.\u201d  --Kent Taylor, Founder and Chairman, Texas Roadhouse Restaurants     \u201cThe book is a fun read filled with memorable stories that get at the heart of what it takes to lead in a way that simultaneously satisfies employees, customers, and shareholders. Jim Parker plays the role of eloquent detective and ferrets out the interweaving parts that distributed leadership, culture, values, and teamwork play as the underlying layers of a company\u2019s success. This is a book about heroes at all levels and the environment needed to create those heroes. A must-read for today\u2019s leaders.\u201d  --Professor Deborah Ancona, Seley Distinguished Professor of Management and Faculty Director of the MIT Leadership Center, Sloan School of Management     \u201cYou\u2019ll laugh and cry reading Jim\u2019s book, and probably won\u2019t be able to put it down. It will forever change the way you view the employees in your organization.\u201d  --Beverly K. Carmichael, Member, Board of Directors, Society for Human Resource Management      People matter most.    You know that. But most companies would rather slash costs, cut headcount, replace well-paid employees with lower-paid employees or outsourced workers, and reduce customer service. No wonder so many fail\u2013while others focused on doing the right thing remain profitable and growth oriented for decades. James F. Parker shows why \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d isn\u2019t just na\u00efve \u201cfeel-goodism:\u201d it\u2019s the most powerful rule for business success. Parker\u2019s stories won\u2019t just convince you: They\u2019ll move you. Na\u00efve? No way. In this book, Southwest Airlines\u2019 former CEO proves why doing what\u2019s right is the #1 rule of business success. James F. Parker tells how after 9/11, Southwest made three pivotal decisions: no layoffs, no pay cuts, and no-hassle refunds for any customer wanting them. The result: Southwest remained profitable and its revenue passenger miles for 4Q01 held steady while the rest of its industry nearly collapsed...and Southwest\u2019s market cap soon exceeded all its major competitors combined.

Young people may not realize it, but acts that appear innocent\u2014such as e-mail and instant messages\u2014can entangle our emotions and lead the heart to places it should not go. Most people give their hearts away long before they give their bodies away, so it is imperative that young people learn the importance of emotional purity, how to avoid the steps that too often lead to a physical downfall and how to live pure lives. Like talking to a big sister who\u2019s gone before them, reading Eyes Wide Open will give young people the necessary keys for making decisions about purity, love and romance. She also shows them how to acquire a thirst for purity as they realize it is not just another rule, but a path that leads to a dimension of deep and fresh living where they can truly thrive.",

From standing at the bedside of the dying, Dr. Robert Wise came to realize there were important patterns and steps that the dying were trying to describe. And, yet, many miss these life lessons when they go to great lengths to avoid a conversation or encounter with the dying. Wise learned by stopping and listening to the dying that we can get beyond our morbid fears of death, to come to a place of peaceful acceptance and to be able to look ahead to a dignified celebration of death. Inspiring stories of those with one foot stepping into eternity give us assurance, hope and a fresh expectation of what lies beyond the grave. We can all face it without fear.

Movingly written, the book traces Dau\u2019s journey through hunger, exhaustion, terror, and violence as he fled his homeland, dodging ambushes, massacres and attacks by wild animals. His tortuous, 14-year journey began in 1987, when he was just 13, and took him on a 1,000-mile walk, barefoot, to Ethiopia, back to Sudan, then to a refugee camp in Kenya, where he lived with thousands of other Lost Boys. In 2001, at the age of 27, he immigrated to the United States. With touching humor, Dau recounts the shock of his tribal culture colliding with life in America. He shares the joy of reuniting with his family and the challenges of making a new life for himself while never forgetting the other Lost Boys he left behind.",

This updated and expanded edition features more than a hundred pages of fresh reporting and commentary, drawn from Friedman's travels around the world and across the American heartland--from anyplace where the flattening of the world is being felt.In The World Is Flat, Friedman at once shows \"how and why globalization has now shifted into warp drive\" (Robert Wright, Slate) and brilliantly demystifies the new flat world for readers, allowing them to make sense of the often bewildering scene unfolding before their eyes. With his inimitable ability to translate complex foreign policy and economic issues, he explains how the flattening of the world happened at the dawn of the twenty-first century; what it means to countries, companies, communities, and individuals; how governments and societies can, and must, adapt; and why terrorists want to stand in the way. More than ever, The World Is Flat is an essential update on globalization, its successes and discontents, powerfully illuminated by one of our most respected journalists.",

If the two dominating political parties could raise and spend money at will, they say, the electoral system would be more competitive, the unique role and capabilities of political parties would be strengthened, and any candidate who raised money from any other source would be viewed with suspicion.

        "Title": "The Best Game Ever: Giants Vs. Colts, 1958, and the Birth of the Modern NFL",
        "Authors": "By Bowden, Mark",
        "Description": "On December 28, 1958, the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts met under the lights of Yankee Stadium for that season's NFL Championship game. Football, growing in popularity amid America's post-war economic boom, was still greatly overshadowed by the country's favored pastime - baseball - but the 1958 championship proved to be the turning point for pro football. In The Best Game Ever, Mark Bowden delivers a brilliant narrative on the 1958 NFL Championship game, the story behind the key players, and the effect the contest had on the modern game of football and today's NFL.Played on a freezing Sunday evening in front of 64,000 fans and millions of television viewers around the country, the championship would go down as the greatest in football history. On the field and roaming the sidelines were seventeen future Hall of Famers, including Colts stars Johnny Unitas, Raymond Berry, and Gino Marchetti, and Giants greats Frank Gifford, Sam Huff, and assistant coaches Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry. The championship was a battle of the league's best offense - the Colts - versus its best defense - the Giants. It squared the blue-collar Baltimore team, many of whom worked off-season jobs selling liquor or taking shifts at Bethlehem Steel, against the glamour boys of the Giants squad who often appeared in TV commercials and were seen around town at trendy spots like Toots Shor's mingling with the likes of politicians and Broadway stars.An estimated forty-five million viewers - at that time the largest crowd to have ever watched a football game - tuned in to see what would become the first sudden-death contest in NFL history. The Colts led at halftime, 14-3, but a courageous goal-line stand by the Giants in the beginning of the third quarter fueled a second-half comeback. The Giants took a three-point lead in the fourth quarter on a Frank Gifford touchdown. With two minutes left in regulation, Baltimore had possession deep in its own territory, and the ball in the hands of the still unproven quarterback Johnny Unitas.The Best Game Ever is a brilliant portrait of how a single game changed the history of American sports. Published to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the championship, it is destined to be a sports classic.",

Bound for the Oregon frontier, Jordan Bryce and her new husband, Colin, a dashing ex-mariner, face danger from both man and nature: a deadly buffalo stampede . . . tragedy at a river crossing . . . hostile Indians . . . and hatred within their wagon train, escalating from bitter words to the point of bloodshed.

For Jordan, the journey west is more than a trip into an untamed land. It is a passage from a teenage girl\u2019s romantic fantasies to the wisdom and character of womanhood. But nothing can prepare Jordan for the testing that awaits her beyond the journey\u2019s end. There, in the face of staggering circumstances, she will face an impossible decision . . . as two good men--one wounded by past grief, the other branded by his own impetuousness--struggle with the demands of faith and honor on behalf of the woman they love.",

        "Description": "'The Channel Advantage' deals with one topic, and deals with it comprehensively and rigorously: how to construct a sales channel system that will yield world-class sales performance and durable competitive advantage. This book helps readers move decisively away from the notion of channel strategy as a sideline to the core business. Building a channel advantage is the core business today, and this is an essential text and reference for all serious marketing and sales professionals and students. Channel innovation is separating market winners from market losers, and not just in leading-edge technology industries. In a business world where industry players are selling practically the same products at essentially the same prices at about the same cost, the only real source of sustainable competitive advantage is the sales channel: how you sell, not what you sell. Selling becomes a question of how to connect products with customers via the best mix of sales channels: the sales force, value-added partners, distributors, retail stores, telemarketing, and the Internet. In short, how companies sell has become as important as what they sell. 'The Channel Advantage' explains how leading companies develop strategies that integrate e-commerce, telemarketing, sales forces, and distributors to achieve superior sales performance and sustainable competitive advantage.Timothy R. Furey is chairman, CEO and co-founder of Oxford Associates, a privately held consulting firm specializing in sales and market strategy, e-commerce channel integration and market research, based in Bethesda, Maryland. Oxford has achieved an annual growth of more than forty percent since its creation in 1991 and was named one of America's 500 fastest growing private companies by Inc. Magazine in 1997. Furey, a pioneer in the use of hybrid sales and marketing strategies for blue chip companies, works extensively with senior management leadership teams to develop and implement go-to-market growth strategies. His clients include IBM, American Express, Marriott, Xerox, Fidelity Investments, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Johnson & Johnson. Under his leadership, Oxford Associates has developed leading-edge strategies, business processes and systems for deploying and integrating multi-channel sales and marketing systems. They work to align products with the right customers via an appropriate mix of the Internet, telesales, distributors, value-added partners, and traditional sales force channels.Mr. Furey is the co-author of THE CHANNEL ADVANTAGE (Butterworth-Heinemann, August 31, 1999), which is endorsed by the CEOs of America Online, Lotus Development, Ocean Spray, and Xerox. Mr. Furey also serves on the Board of Directors of Alpha Industries (Nasdaq:AHAA), a leading semiconductor manufacturer for wireless telephone applications.Previously, Mr. Furey worked with Boston Consulting Group, Strategic Planning Associates, Kaiser Associates and the Marketing Science Institute. He earned a BA in Economics, cum laude, from Harvard University and an MBA from the Harvard Business School. Lawrence G. Friedman is an internationally recognized channel strategy consultant whose clients have included companies such as Lotus, AT&T, Canon, Compaq Digital Equipment, Microsoft and Bell Atlantic. He also held executive level positions at Andersen Consulting and Huthwaite, Inc., the sales research firm that developed the SPIN Selling Model.In 1996, Friedman, with Neil Rackham and Richard Ruff, co-authored the best-seller, GETTING PARTNERING RIGHT (McGraw-Hill). He is on the review board of the Journal of Selling and Major Account Management, which published his article, Multiple Channel Sales Strategy, in the April, 1999 issue.His firm, The Sales Strategy Institute, works with clients to identify and evaluate new go-to-market opportunities and conducts in-depth channel strategy workshops and seminars. Mr. Friedman is a frequent guest speaker and lecturer on sales and channel strategy throughout the United States, Europe and Asia.Mr. Friedman earned an MA from the University of Chicago.",

        "Title": "Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)",
        "Authors": "By Rigby, Jill",
        "Description": "This inspirational parenting guide offers proactive and positive steps to raising respectful, engaged, and grateful children.In an effort to raise children with a healthy view of themselves, parents often focus on self-esteem rather than self-respect. And author Jill Rigby says there\u2019s a big difference. It\u2019s the difference between self-centered and others-centered children, the difference between performance-driven and purpose-focused teenagers. Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World examines three different styles of parenting\u2014parent-centered, child-centered, and character-centered. Parent-centered parents are more concerned with their own agenda than their child\u2019s best interest. Child-centered parents are more concerned with their child\u2019s approval than their child\u2019s well-being. Character-centered parents are more concerned with their child\u2019s character than their child\u2019s comfort. Drawing a distinction between performance and purpose, this book maintains that rather than focusing on what you want your child to do, you ask what you want your child to become. Finally, Rigby calls for parents to discipline (teach) their children rather than punish them. With wisdom and insight, Jill Rigby shares age-appropriate ways to set boundaries with children without building walls of separation. Whether you\u2019re parenting tots or teens, Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World offers valuable advice for cultivating a house of respect.",
