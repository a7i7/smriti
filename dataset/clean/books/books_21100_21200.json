In this infinitely citable book, the author of two bestselling treasuries of scandal recounts some of the greatest deceptions of all time. With what forged document did the Vatican lay claim to much of Europe? Who wrote Hitler\u2019s diaries? Why do millions still believe the vague doggerel that Nostradamus passed off as prophecy? Organizing his material by theme (con artists, the press, military trickery, scientific fraud, imposters, great escapes, and more), Michael Farquhar takes in everything from the hoodwinking of Hitler to Vincent \u201cthe Chin\u201d Gigante\u2019s thirty-year crazy act.A Treasury of Deception is a zestful, gossipy expos\u00e9\u2014and celebration\u2014of mendacity.A Treasury of Deception also includes:Ten tricksters from scriptureTen great liars in literatureTen egregious examples of modern American doublespeakTen classic deceptions from Greek mythology",

        "Title": "Big Muddy: Down the Mississippi Through America's Heartland",

        "Description": "Just over a hundred years ago Mark Twain created an American classic with Life on the Mississippi, a vivid chronicle of the majestic river that winds through America's heartland. Now Big Muddy follows in its wake to bring us an evocative, entertaining, and enormously informative account of our country's premier waterway at the close of the twentieth century.From Minnesota to Louisiana, the Mississippi sweeps through America's center, capturing all of its astonishing variety. From the Midwestern pragmatism of Minnesota's mythical Lake Wobegon region to the jazz- and blues-rich but cash-poor city of East St. Louis...from the old men in sweat-stained Dobb's hats trading flood stories at country crossroad stores to the legendary Highway 61 immortalized by Bob Dylan...from the Delta tenant farmers scratching out a living on pesticide-ridden soil to the rich Cajun ancestry of Louisiana's hidden bayous, the river keeps rolling along in glorious celebration and somber reflection of the people and the places that have shaped its path even as it has shaped their lives.But more than just a colorful rhapsody to life along the Mississippi, Big Muddy is a robust recreation of the history that has coursed through its waters: the early explorers and their futile search for the fabled Northwest passage, the steamboat pilots and riverboat gamblers of Twain's era, the various tribes who battled for the right to a life along its shores, and the tanker captains who navigate the shocking \"Dead Zone\" of the modern Delta as they face the ecological nightmares that threaten the Mississippi's future.Wide in scope and irresistibly appealing, this vibrant cultural commemoration of America's greatest river is a worthy successor to Mark Twain's landmark book and a powerful social, political, and environmental portrait of a uniquely American experience.",

        "Description": "On a spring afternoon in 1991, Richard Selzer, a retired surgeon and renowned medical essayist, collapsed while gazing from his study window. He was rushed to the hospital where he had practiced for many years, his former colleagues frantically struggling to contain the chaos toward which his body's systems were rampaging. Diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease, Selzer lapsed into a coma and began a painful journey to a place where there was \"more than a hint of death.\"Raising the Dead is Selzer's vivid account of that journey - a trip to the underworld of disease, a world whose horrors are eased only by dementia, a place where death is as close as a lover. While his wife, children, doctors, and a gritty, wisecracking Irish nurse hover over him, Selzer suffers through the pain and indignity of medical procedures and the agonizing hallucinations that follow coma. Yet he \"invites the IV pole, the respirator, the whole massive bank of machinery to suggest the background for a story.\" This story, the mysterious drama of the struggle between life and death, he relates with great power, elegance, and, surprisingly, wit. Few have been players in this drama and lived to tell about it. Fewer still, if any, can write about it with the intelligence and profundity of Richard Selzer.",

He is most famous for the hilarious, often bittersweet stories that he published in the 1930s and 1940s in the New Yorker. He was also a brilliant cartoonist whose unique drawings were an eagerly awaited feature in Harold Ross\u2019s New Yorker and in Thurber\u2019s books.This biography is a book much in the spirit of Thurber himself. Readable, anecdotal, and often delightfully funny, Remember Laughter will be cherished by all fans of Thurber.Yet Neil A. Grauer by no means sentimentalizes Thurber. He addresses serious, and often disturbing, features of Thurber\u2019s life while highlighting Thurber\u2019s courage, inexhaustible humor, and unique literary and artistic talents. The result is a biography that both celebrates Thurber\u2019s genius and shrewdly appraises his qualities as a man.",

On the basis of years of research, interviews with dozens of the central figures, and her own personal experience, Evans explores how the political stance of these women was catalyzed and shaped by their sharp disillusionment at a time when their skills as political activists were newly and highly developed, enabling them to join forces to support their own cause.",

        "Authors": "By Lawford, Christopher Kennedy",
        "Description": "Born into enormous privilege as well as burdened by gut-wrenching family tragedy, Christopher Kennedy Lawford now shares his life story, offering a rare glimpse into the private worlds of the rich and famous of both Washington politics and the Hollywood elite. A triumphantly inspiring memoir, the first from a Kennedy family member since Rose Kennedy's 1974 autobiography, Lawford's Symptoms of Withdrawal tells the bittersweet truth about life inside America's greatest family legacy.As the firstborn child of famed Rat Pack actor Peter Lawford and Patricia Kennedy, sister to John F. Kennedy, Christopher Kennedy Lawford grew up with presidents and movie stars as close relatives and personal friends.Lawford recalls Marilyn Monroe teaching him to dance the twist in his living room when he was still a toddler, being awakened late at night by his uncle Jack to hear him announce his candidacy for president, being perched atop a high-roller craps table in Las Vegas while Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack swapped jokes and threw dice, and other treasured memories of his youth as part of America's royal family.In spite of this seemingly idyllic childhood, Lawford's early life was marked by the traumatic assassinations of his beloved uncles Jack and Bobby, and he soon succumbed to the burgeoning drug scene of the 1970s during his teen years. With compelling realism mixed with equal doses of self-deprecating wit, youthful bravado, and hard-earned humility, Symptoms of Withdrawal chronicles Lawford's deep and long descent into near-fatal drug and alcohol addiction, and his subsequent formidable path back to the sobriety he has preserved for the past twenty years.Symptoms of Withdrawal is a poignantly honest portrayal of Lawford's life as a Kennedy, a journey overflowing with hilarious insider anecdotes, heartbreaking accounts of Lawford's addictions to narcoticsas well as to celebrity and, ultimately, the redemption he found by asserting his own independence.In this groundbreakingly courageous and exceptionally well-written memoir, Lawford steps forward to rise above the buried pain that first led to his addiction, and today lives mindfully by his time-tested mantra: \"We are only as sick as the secrets we keep.\" Symptoms of Withdrawal keeps no secrets and is a compelling testament to the power of truth.",

In the clear, readable, entertaining style that brought acclaim for his best-selling Age of Diminished Expectations, Krugman explains what real economic analysis is. He discusses economic terms and measurements, like \"value-added\" and GDP, in simple language so that readers can understand how pop internationalists distort, and sometimes contradict, the most basic truths about world trade.All but two of the essays have previously appeared in such publications as Foreign Affairs, Scientific American, and the Harvard Business Review. The first five essays take on exaggerations of foreign competition's effects on the U.S. economy and represent Krugman's central criticisms of public debate over world trade. The next three essays expose further distortions of economic theory and include the complete, unaltered, controversial review of Laura Tyson's Who's Bashing Whom. The third group of essays highlights misconceptions about competition from less industrialized countries. The concluding essays focus on interesting and legitimate economic questions, such as the effects of technological change on society.",

And for a woman in her mid-fifties, who probably has more than a quarter of a century of living before her, the news is both surprising and encouraging.In this groundbreaking book, Caroline Bird reports on the hitherto undocumented world of lively, productive, independent women who are inventing satisfying new lives for themselves, mostly after spending years in the traditional roles of wives and mothers.In searching for these pioneers, Bird found an immensely varied group of women who are living full lives well into their seventies, eighties, even nineties. What they have in common is a zest for living that will inspire the rest of us - and, even better, show us how to seek out a future that may not be easy but that is full of possibilities.The women in this book are the pioneers, the success stories. For them, it often wasn't easy. To get where they are, they have had to be both inventive and persistent. In the second half of Bird's book, she documents the many, frequently subtle types of discrimination against older women.",

Married and a mother in her early twenties, she soon became a divorced single parent, raising her young daughter on her own. Remarriage and new motherhood brought great joy but also the complications of combining families and raising stepchildren. With heartbreaking candor, she details the difficult adaptations and painful rebellions that haunt a parent's conscience.Through it all, Roiphe keenly felt feminism's discomfort with the question of motherhood. Allowing the conservative right to co-opt the issue of family, feminism has sometimes overlooked the very real emotional and economic needs of mother just trying to make it through the day. Here, Roiphe crafts a unique pro-feminist/pro-family position that calls for fruitful dialogue on quality childcare, on including men as full partners in parenting, on defining family in ways that allow everyone to thrive.",

        "Title": "The Man Who Broke Napoleon's Codes",
        "Authors": "By Urban, Mark",
        "Description": "History books report -- and rightly so -- that it was the strategic and intelligence-gathering brilliance of the Duke of Wellington (who began his military career as Arthur Wellesley) that culminated in Britain's defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo in 1815. Nearly two hundred years later, many of General Wellesley's subordinates are still remembered for their crucial roles in these historic campaigns. But Lt. Col. George Scovell is not among them. The Man Who Broke Napoleon's Codes is the story of a man of common birth -- bound, according to the severe social strictures of eighteenth-century England, for the life of a tradesman -- who would in time become his era's most brilliant code-breaker and an officer in Wellesley's army. In an age when officers were drawn almost exclusively from the ranks of the nobility, George Scovell -- an engraver's apprentice -- joined Wellesley in 1809. Scovell provides a fascinating lens through which to view a critical era in military history -- his treacherous rise through the ranks, despite the scorn of his social betters and his presence alongside Wellesley in each of the major European campaigns, from the Iberian Peninsula through Waterloo. But George Scovell was more than just a participant in those events. Already recognized as a gifted linguist, Scovell would prove a remarkably nimble cryptographer. Encoded military communiqu\u00e9s between Napoleon and his generals, intercepted by the British, were brought to Scovell for his skilled deciphering. As Napoleon's encryption techniques became more sophisticated, Wellesley came to rely ever more on Scovell's genius for this critical intelligence. In Scovell's lifetime, his role in Britain's greatest military victory was grudgingly acknowledged; but his accomplishments would eventually be credited to others -- including Wellington himself. Scovell's name -- and his contributions -- have been largely overlooked or ignored. The Man Who Broke Napoleon's Codes tells the fascinating story of the early days of cryptology, re-creates the high drama of some of Europe's most remarkable military campaigns, and restores the mantle of hero to a man heretofore forgotten by history.",

J. Watson, whom we first saw, obliquely, through the eyes of his early twentieth-century Everglades community in Killing Mister Watson.This astonishing new novel, calling to account the violence, virulent racism, and destruction of the land that fueled the so-called American Dream, points an accusing finger straight into the burning eyes of Uncle Sam. Here is the bloodied child of the Civil War and Reconstruction who dreams of recovering the family plantation. He becomes the gifted cane planter nearing success on a wilderness river when he gives in fatally to his accumulating demons. Powerfully imagined, prodigiously detailed, Bone by Bone is a literary tour de force as bold and ambitious as Watson himself. \"Like a true tragic figure, [Watson] knows and understands; he does not wriggle to save his own skin,\" said The New York Times. \"This is a work of genuine dignity.\"",

        "Description": "Fresh Cuts: Arrangements with Flowers, Leaves, Buds & Branches is an exciting new look at the unexpected possibilities the plant world offers for beauty and enjoyment. It will change the way we approach flower arranging.  The one hundred elegant photographs by John M. Hall and the charming, informative text by garden designer Edwina von Gal show that one's choices for natural decorative arrangements need not be limited to flowers. Rather, von Gal and Hall emphasize the intrinsic beauty of each part of the plant, including buds, stems, leaves, berries and fruit. In tune with the current trend toward minimalism in interior decorating, the arrangements featured in this book are appealingly spare and simple. Among the many inspired ideas are a gathering of delicate periwinkle, the flowers a perfect complement to the leaves; a tabletop arrangement of beautifully textured pods and seeds; the rich, red stems of rhubarb chard in a clear glass vase; and a single rose of Sharon in glorious full bloom.  Von Gal's whimsical, anecdotal text offers facts, observations, and folklore, as well as practical guidance for the care and maintenance of the plants featured in her creative arrangements. Her provocative captions invite us to stop, take a closer look, and experience plants in ways we might not have thought of before--in vases or in their natural settings.  Filled with novel, accessible ideas, Fresh Cuts also suggests that the enjoyable act of decorating one's home or office can be combined with a dedicated foraging expedition, a casual nature walk, or a spiritual lesson in understanding our own symbiotic connection to the world of plants.",

Michael Ahearn, a professor at a rural college, sheds his comfortable assumptions when he becomes obsessed with a new faculty member from the Caribbean, Lara Purcell. An expert in Third World politics, Lara is seductive, dangerous \u2014 and in thrall, she claims, to a voodoo spirit who has taken possession of her soul. Impassioned and determined, Michael pursues Lara to her native island of St. Trinity, heedless of the political upheaval there. Together they desperately attempt to reclaim all that Lara has lost. Yet island intrigue ensnares them. Lara sacrifices herself to ritual and superstition. Michael is caught unawares in a high-stakes smuggling scheme. In his feverish state of mind, the world becomes an ever-shifting phantasmagoria. He is, himself, possessed. In Bay of Souls, readers will recognize the trademarks of Stone\u2019s greatest fiction: the American embroiled in Third World corruption, the diplomats and covert operatives, the idealists and opportunists. Yet here the author\u2019s sights are set inward, to a place where politics is superfluous, experience unreliable. Never before has Stone probed so powerfully the psychological depths of one man\u2019s mind. What he finds there defies expectations.",

This irresistibly entertaining book recounts the random incidents and soul-searching that inspired a reluctant party boy to devote his life to a cause, without ever abandoning his sense of mischief and fun. \"Everyone has a tense moment in their career that makes them wonder, how the hell did I get into this mess?\" writes Mathews. \"For me, it was when I was dressed as a carrot to promote vegetarianism outside an elementary school in Des Moines, and a pack of obese pig farmers showed up and peeled off slices of bologna for kids to throw at me.\" As the irreverent force behind the colorful crusades carried out by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), one of the most effective and enduring pressure groups in the world, Mathews has strutted naked before a fur convention in Tokyo, halted GM's use of animals in crash tests by storming the carmaker's float in the Rose Parade dressed as a rabbit, and crashed a fashion show in Milan dressed as a priest. With self-deprecating wit and candor, Mathews reveals all the edgy details of his unorthodox coming-of-age and equally outrageous career.With backdrops such as the rock scene in Hollywood and London, the inner sanctums of New York high fashion, jails in Hong Kong and Boston, and a psychiatric ward in Paris, Committed spotlights the adventures life can offer when you don't abandon your youthful ideals and imagination.",

        "Title": "Sneaking Into the Flying Circus: How the Media Turn Our Presidential Campaigns into Freak Shows",
        "Authors": "By Pelosi, Alexandra",
        "Description": "Alexandra Pelosi, creator of the Emmy award-winning film Journeys with George and of Diary of a Political Tourist, makes her literary debut with an intimate look at the frenzied and grueling underbelly of presidential campaigning and the puppet role of the media. Pelosi went along on the campaign trail in order to, as she puts it, \"document the absurd hazing rituals that our presidential candidates have to go through.\" With this savvy, well-connected, and fearless guide, it's a rollicking, breakneck journey unlike any other.  Pelosi's one-on-one time with the 2004 presidential candidates affords an up-close perspective on the highs and lows of campaign life: the genuine thrill of seeing America, the unrelenting grind of endless campaign stops, the hope and heartache of poll results. While the candidates try to stick to tightly constructed scripts, Pelosi's nonnetwork angle makes for revealing portraits of the men who wanted to be president.  But even more, Pelosi's approach reveals fundamental flaws in the media's election coverage. A former member of the campaign press corps, she turns her gimlet eye on the media, which are busy enacting their own election-time rituals: \"Every election cycle journalists defy the theory of evolution, living sequestered on a bus, with no sleep, few showers, and tons of junk food, going town-to-town listening to the same speech over and over. You're stuck in this dysfunctional relationship between the news organization that has you there to do their bidding and the campaign that is trying to co-opt you.\"  And herein lies Pelosi's driving point: politicians and journalists don't trust each other, and so, in election coverage and in politics in general, the press is utterly hamstrung. Since the candidates never say anything unscripted and the journalists have to make nice in order to maintain access, modern presidential campaigns have become little more than media events. Politicians and journalists alike are going through the motions, and the voters have no idea who the candidates really are.  But Pelosi says the public are not fools: \"Everyone knows that the media do not give them an accurate portrait of a person.\" No wonder people are apathetic. But whose fault is it? Are the candidates driving people away from the political process, or are the media keeping them out?  Probing, insightful, and lively, Sneaking into the Flying Circus exposes the election process for what it is: a three-ring gala production that comes to town every four years. As a nation and an audience, we're often willing to suspend disbelief -- and we often can't resist when the clowns try to get us in on the act. It is, after all, the greatest show on earth.",

        "Description": "This ingenious and original anthology of quotations, compiled by Anthony Sampson and Sally Sampson, brings together the wit and wisdom of some of the more remarkable figures of the past and present, as they pause to reflect on their achievements or aspirations and on what it means to be a certain age.      If you wish to find your experiences shared, or your fears and hopes for the future confirmed, turn to any age for the expression of views by novelists, poets, painters and musicians, scientists, doctors, and sociologists.  Profound truths as well as ironic observations from the diaries, letters, biographies, and autobiographies of contributors as diverse as Cicero and Ogden Nash, Picasso and Mozart, Goethe and Churchill emerge to enlighten us.      Personal memories and educators' and psychoanalysts' theories on the early years contrast with more spontaneous reactions such as that of Queen Victoria to her grandchild--\"An ugly baby is a very nasty object.\"  From the traumas of adolescence to the first intimations of mortality in the twenties and thirties, the imaginative thinker runs riot; the lean years of middle age prove a time of readjustment for many, but not all agree with Charles Peguy that \"forty is a terrible age.\"  Old age means a time of rage and regrets for some, but for others the time of greatest happiness, serenity, or achievement.      Reading these pages may encourage you to proclaim your age or to hide it; whatever you decide, you will realize that you are in good company.",
