But admission into the traitorous society of evil carried a grim price: the life of Decius's closest friend...and maybe his own.",

The Jesus that Strand uncovers is definitely the Christ of the Gospels, and the political, cultural, and religious times in which He lived are brought to life in this terrific book. Read about the traditions that Jesus grew up with, the historical facts about his birth, death, and resurrection, and man\u2019s ideas about Him vs. reality. Great as a reference book or gift, this collection of fascinating facts serves to illuminate \u201cGod With Us.\u201d SAMPLE FACTS:  What was Jesus' last name? According to Jewish tradition, one\u2019s last name was always determined by the father\u2019s given name. So the Lord\u2019s complete name would have been \u201cYeshua Ben Yosef.\u201d  Old Testament Prophecies Contained in the Old Testament, there are more than 300 specific prophecies alone that concerned Jesus, the promised coming Messiah. These were written from 450 to more than 2,000 years before his birth. It\u2019s been mathematically calculated that the probability of just 8 of the more than 300 prophecies being fulfilled by chance is 1 in 1017. It is beyond the realm of calculation to figure the probability of all 300-plus coming to pass in one life.",

Written by Sandor Nagyszalanczy, a former senior editor of Fine Woodworking magazine and an acknowledged expert in the field, this illustrated guide shows step-by-step how to create built-ins that are both practical and appealing. Here are hundreds of design ideas for projects for every room of the house, including kitchens, bathrooms, libraries, kids' spaces, dining rooms, bedrooms, and the increasingly popular media spaces. The book shows a wide range of possibilities for incorporating built-ins, from niches to bookcases to spaces that replace those stacks of clothing in the closet.

        "Description": "\u201cThe best short biography of Franklin ever written.\u201d\u2014Gordon S. Wood Benjamin Franklin is perhaps the most remarkable figure in American history: the greatest statesman of his age, he played a pivotal role in the formation of the American republic. He was also a pioneering scientist, a bestselling author, the country\u2019s first postmaster general, a printer, a bon vivant, a diplomat, a ladies\u2019 man, and a moralist\u2014and the most prominent celebrity of the eighteenth century. Franklin was, however, a man of vast contradictions, as Edmund Morgan demonstrates in this brilliant biography. A reluctant revolutionary, Franklin had desperately wished to preserve the British Empire, and he mourned the break even as he led the fight for American independence. Despite his passion for science, Franklin viewed his groundbreaking experiments as secondary to his civic duties. And although he helped to draft both the Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution, he had personally hoped that the new American government would take a different shape. Unraveling the enigma of Franklin\u2019s character, Morgan shows that he was the rare individual who consistently placed the public interest before his own desires. Written by one of our greatest historians, Benjamin Franklin offers a provocative portrait of America\u2019s most extraordinary patriot.",

        "Title": "The Independence of Miss Mary Bennet",
        "Authors": "By McCullough, Colleen",
        "Description": "Everyone knows the story of Elizabeth and Jane Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. But what about their sister Mary? At the conclusion of Jane Austen's classic novel, Mary, bookish, awkward, and by all accounts, unmarriageable, is sentenced to a dull, provincial existence in the backwaters of Britain. Now, master storyteller Colleen McCullough rescues Mary from her dreary fate with The Independence of Miss Mary Bennet, a page-turning sequel set twenty years after Austen's novel closes. The story begins as the neglected Bennet sister is released from the stultifying duty of caring for her insufferable mother. Though many would call a woman of Mary's age a spinster, she has blossomed into a beauty to rival that of her famed sisters. Her violet eyes and perfect figure bewitch the eligible men in the neighborhood, but though her family urges her to marry, romance and frippery hold no attraction. Instead, she is determined to set off on an adventure of her own. Fired with zeal by the newspaper letters of the mysterious Argus, she resolves to publish a book about the plight of England's poor. Plunging from one predicament into another, Mary finds herself stumbling closer to long-buried secrets, unanticipated dangers, and unlooked-for romance.Meanwhile, the other dearly loved characters of Pride and Prejudice fret about the missing Mary while they contend with difficulties of their own. Darcy's political ambitions consume his ardor, and he bothers with Elizabeth only when the impropriety of her family seems to threaten his career. Lydia, wild and charming as ever, drinks and philanders her way into dire straits; Kitty, a young widow of means, occupies herself with gossip and shopping; and Jane, na\u00efve and trusting as ever, spends her days ministering to her crop of boys and her adoring, if not entirely faithful, husband. Yet, with the shadowy and mysterious figure of Darcy\u00d5s right-hand man, Ned Skinner, lurking at every corner, it is clear that all is not what it seems at idyllic Pemberley. As the many threads of McCullough\u00d5s masterful plot come together, shocking truths are revealed, love, both old and new, is tested, and all learn the value of true independence in a novel for every woman who has wanted to leave her mark on the world.",

        "Description": "The U.S. health care system is in crisis. At stake are the quality of care for millions of Americans and the financial well-being of individuals and employers squeezed by skyrocketing premiums&#151;not to mention the stability of state and federal government budgets.In Redefining Health Care, internationally renowned strategy expert Michael Porter and innovation expert Elizabeth Teisberg reveal the underlying&#151;and largely overlooked&#151;causes of the problem, and provide a powerful prescription for change.The authors argue that competition currently takes place at the wrong level&#151;among health plans, networks, and hospitals&#151;rather than where it matters most, in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of specific health conditions. Participants in the system accumulate bargaining power and shift costs in a zero-sum competition, rather than creating value for patients. Based on an exhaustive study of the U.S. health care system, Redefining Health Care lays out a breakthrough framework for redefining the way competition in health care delivery takes place&#151;and unleashing stunning improvements in quality and efficiency.With specific recommendations for hospitals, doctors, health plans, employers, and policy makers, this book shows how to move health care toward positive-sum competition that delivers lasting benefits for all.",
