        "Description": "In his bestselling Healing Words, Dossey provided abundant evidence that praying - for oneself or others - makes a scientifically measurable difference in recovering from illness or trauma. Now, in Prayer Is Good Medicine, the doctor shows us how we can make the most of our own healing prayers.In a series of short, inspiring chapters, he addresses common questions and concerns about harnessing the healing potential of prayer, including whether to pray with or without words, when and how much to pray, the role of religion in our health, how the medical establishment feels about prayer, and even how to avoid the destructive side of prayer. Dossey emphasizes that praying is not a replacement for good medical treatment, but instead is a very effective addition to it - it just makes good sense to use both.In Prayer Is Good Medicine, you will learn that prayer works, even across great distance; seeking general guidance through prayer can be more valuable than asking for something specific; adopting a compassionate, sincere, and loving attitude will allow your prayers to be truly beneficial; prayers are always answered - though the answer may not be \"yes\"; and hope heals.Interspersed throughout Dossey's warm and wise reflections are references to studies proving the link between prayer and health, direct retorts to the skepticism that surrounds prayer, and uplifting stories from people - doctors, patients, relatives, and friends - who share their personal experiences with prayer's healing power. No matter what form your faith takes, you'll come away from Prayer Is Good Medicine with a new appreciation of how prayer can bring about healthful change and the tools to make that happen.",

Examine basic beliefs: If you knew you would not produce anything of real significance in your life, how would it change your goals and attitudes? Fantasize about power: If you could determine who could immigrate here, would you let in those who would contribute the most to our country or those most in need of refuge? Define convictions: If you were certain someone convicted of armed robbery would never commit another crime, would you choose a punishment that involved no prison sentence? Perhaps even rehearse for tomorrow: What would you do if after shaking hands on a deal for an item you are selling, someone else offers you twice as much?Fuel those all-to-rare talks that go deep into the night-and explore and refine your values. 106,000 copies in print.",

But with the first snap of winter comes shocking news that puts her practise on the line: a teenage boy under her care has committed an appalling act of violence. And as Claire and all of Tranquility soon discover, it is just the start of a chain of lethal outbursts among the town's teenagers.  As the rash of disturbing behavior grows, Claire uncovers a horrifying secret: this is not the first time it has happened. Twice a century,the children of Tranquility lash out with deadly violence. Claire suspects that there is a biological cause for the epidemic, and she fears that the placid Locust Lake may conceal an insidious danger. As she races to save Tranquility -- and her son -- from harm, Claire discovers an even greater threat: a shocking conspiracy to manipulate nature, and turn innocents to slaughter.",

But to do so this modest beauty, who had forsaken all carnal pleasure, must judge a warrior whose mere presence exuded a dangerous, unpredictable, and totally male sensuality.He\u2019d do anything to be a husband....Peril, earl of Whitmore, needed a virtuous wife in the worst possible way.

And as the dark secret of the Whitmore estate is revealed and their passion ignited by a single forbidden touch, they find that the perfect match is often made in a far more sensuous place than heaven.",
