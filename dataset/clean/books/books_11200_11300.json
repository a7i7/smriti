        "Description": "From the author of Passage to Juneau comes a novel set in Seattle at the turn of the millennium, when the high-tech Gold Rush threatens to overwhelm the actual world with its myriad virtual alternatives.Two immigrants, though, are drawn here by more traditional versions of the American Dream. For Tom Janeway - a Hungarian-born Englishman - it is the wife and son he thought he'd never have. For an illegal alien - Chick, as he comes to call himself - it is the land of opportunity he'd imagined back in the Fujian province. Given the overheated service economy, mutual need introduces the writer-professor-NPR-commentator to this enterprising handyman, and each soon finds himself strangely dependent on the other. Because meanwhile, all around them, people are busily charting futures that are obscure to, or exclude, anyone else.Waxwings depicts the social realities of a boomtown in flux, as well as the illusions that distract its inhabitants from the most basic human impulse: to create a place we can call home. This is what Chick dreams of achieving, and what Tom must suddenly struggle to preserve. As the NASDAQ index spirals upward, street riots break out, a terrorist is arrested, a child disappears, a jetliner goes down - and the city, rimmed with feral countryside, begins to emerge in its true colors.",

        "Description": "What will Russia be like in the year 2010? What impact will the future of Russia have on the West? And what could we do now to help shape a better future?In this brilliant and illuminating book, Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Prize, and Thane Gustafson, leading expert on Russian politics and economics, present four \"histories\" of the future for Russia and offer a vision of \"capitalism Russian style.\"The collapse of the Soviet Union and communism is the most important event at the end of the twentieth century. But what comes next? Using the unique technique of \"scenario planning,\" Yergin and Gustafson explore what the \"new Russian revolution\" will bring. Which scenario will it be? Will it be The Two-Headed Eagle, a Russia that looks forward and backward at the same time; The Long Good-bye, the dissolution of Russia; or the Russian Bear, a grim dictatorship, anti-West and turned in on itself? Or will it be Chudo, the Russian economic miracle? The authors analyze the consequences of each scenario for the United States and other countries, pointing to possible surprises. Yergin and Gustafson provide essential insight into emerging power relationships, local wars that could turn into larger conflicts, the time bombs of ethnic strife that sit on Russia's borders - and the economic and political opportunities facing us in the future.Russia 2010 grew out of a confidential study developed for a select group of international companies by Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), a leading international consulting firm. Yergin and Gustafson focus on Russia's enormously difficult triple transition - from dictatorship to democracy, from communism to a market economy, and from empire to nation state. The authors envision the struggles ahead, as excommunists, scions of the security state, and defense industrialists vie with democrats and the new entrepreneurs for their share of Russia's future.Russia 2010 provides a framework for understanding the revolution in Russia. Yergin and Gustafson analyze the role of foreign investment and international aid, the priorities for arms control, and the fault lines that could shake relations between the United States and Russia.Fascinating and authoritative, Russia 2010 will shape debates about the future and is the book that Americans need to read to make sense of events.",

        "Description": "Set in Jane Hamilton's signature Midwest, The Short History of a Prince is the story of Walter McCloud and his ambition to become a great ballet dancer. With compassion and humor, and alternating between Walter's adolescent and adult voices, the novel tells of Walter's heartbreak as he realizes that his passion cannot make up for the innate talent that he lacks.Introduced as a child to the genius of Balanchine and the lyricism of Tchaikovsky by his stern but cultured aunt Sue Rawson, Walter has dreamed of growing up to shine in the role of the Prince in The Nutcracker. But as Walter struggles with the limits of his own talent and faces the knowledge that Mitch and Susan, his more gifted friends, have already surpassed him, Daniel, his older brother, awakens one morning with a strange lump on his neck that leads to fearful consequences - and to Walter's realization that a happy family, and a son's place in it, can tragically change overnight. The year that follows will in fact transform the lives not only of the McClouds but also of Susan, who becomes deeply involved with the sick Daniel, and Mitch, the handsome and supremely talented dancer with whom Walter is desperately in love. Into this absorbing narrative Hamilton weaves a place of almost mythical healing, the family's summer home at Lake Margaret, Wisconsin, where for generations the clan has gathered on both happy and unhappy occasions.",

        "Description": "Forty percent of adult American men have sexual problems at some point in their lives. The women they love are often just as bewildered and dismayed as they are. Now, for the first time, a prominent sex therapist with more than fifteen years of experience offers these women clear, concise advice on helping their mates and restoring sexual fulfillment to their relationships.Addressing the full range of sexual dysfunction, from premature ejaculation, loss of desire, and impotence to fetishism and sexual addiction, Eva Margolies takes women into the male mind to examine the roots of sexual problems, showing how women may unknowingly make them worse and how a caring partner can be crucial to overcoming them.This invaluable book discusses the personality traits and physical characteristics associated with many problems, as well as how to react when they first occur, and what never to say to a dysfunctional man. And it provides insights into whether a problem indicates larger issues that need to be confronted in the relationship.The author recommends specific exercises that can be used to deal with common problems, and there are guidelines to determine those situations where professional help is needed.Groundbreaking, compassionate, and filled with fascinating case histories, Undressing the American Male is for every woman who wants a fuller understanding of her sexual partner and herself.",

Women, too, join to fight alongside their husbands and fathers. Two centuries long, this common cause is the defining war of what was becoming the spirit of the Western world.The author has commented, \"I think of this as a book about the Crusades, not an 'historical novel' - a term that suggests imaginary experiences and unlikely conversations. Monologues and dialogues in this book are paraphrased or condensed from those in medieval documents. Every meeting, every conversation, every triumph or defeat, no matter how small, was recorded centuries ago.\"",

They enter their union clear-eyed, each making certain accommodations and gaining certain benefits. Hannie believes that this time she can make it work. But their move to Ned's ancestral home in the Irish countryside brings vexations Hannie never imagined - judging eyes, ancient secrets, a brooding and beautiful landscape.

        "Authors": "By Clark, Mary Higgins",
        "Description": "From Mary Higgins Clark, America's best-selling \"Queen of Suspense,\" comes a dark and chilling story of murder, and its effects years later on the man convicted of the crime and the woman who helped convict him. It is a novel that takes the reader to the heights of suspense while exploring the depths of the criminal mind.  *  Ellie Cavanaugh was only seven years old when her fifteen-year-old sister, Andrea, was murdered near their home in Oldham-on-the-Hudson, a rural village in New York's Westchester County. There were three suspects: Rob Westerfield, nineteen-year-old scion of a wealthy, prominent family, whom Andrea has been secretly dating; Paul Stroebel, a sixteen-year-old schoolmate, who had a crush on Andrea; and Will Nebels, a local handyman in his forties.  It was Ellie who had led her parents to a hideout in which Andrea's body was found -- a secret hideaway in which she met her friends. And it was Ellie who was blamed by her parents for her sister's death for not telling them about this place the night Andrea was missing. It was also Ellie's testimony that led to the conviction of the man she was firmly convinced was the killer. Steadfastly denying his guilt, he spent the next twenty-two years in prison.  When he comes up for parole, Ellie, now an investigative reporter for an Atlanta newspaper, protests his release. Nonetheless, the convicted killer is set free and returns to Oldham. Determined to thwart his attempts to whitewash his reputation, Ellie also returns to Oldham, intent on creating a Website and writing a book that will conclusively prove his guilt. As she delves deeper into her research, however, she uncovers horrifying and heretofore unknown facts that shed new light on her sister's murder. With each discovery, she comes closer to a confrontation with a desperate killer.  Gripping and relentlessly compelling, Daddy's Little Girl, a portrayal of a family shattered by crime, reflects Mary Higgins Clark's uncanny insight into the twisted mind of a killer and is further evidence of why she is America's favorite author of suspense.",

Warren Christopher is that rarest of Washington personalities: a wise and witty public servant once described by the Washington Post as \"the antithesis of the glitz-hungry, self-aggrandizing, corner-cutting political figures who dominate Washington today.\" In this memoir, the man whose sage counsel and sometimes parodied discretion brought him to the right hand of mayors, governors, and presidents, shares his personal recollections and impressions of leaders and events that shaped the second half of the twentieth century.  Writing in tightly crafted, often self-effacing prose, Christopher chronicles how he left the privacy of life at a premier law firm to heed calls to public service from Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas, Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, and California governor Edmund \"Pat\" Brown -- as well as presidents Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton. Throughout his career, Christopher faced diverse challenges: he advised a president on whether to dispatch federal troops to quell civil disturbances; led negotiations to free American hostages in Iran; investigated a major city's police force gone awry; and helped cope with Yitzhak Rabin's assassination.  From \"Starting from Scranton\" and \"The Johnson Treatment\" to \"Middle East: Antipodes\" and \"Yesterday a War, Today a Country,\" each chapter is a compelling story on its own. Together, they offer the first clear picture of the impact of this quiet North Dakotan on modern American history.",

Minutes later the young woman collapses and dies in front of the hotel. She certainly didn't kill herself, she was stabbed to death.Maggie and Claire - together with Boulton, the dashing butler who moonlights as the muscle in this unlikely menage - decide to stick around. Their client won't be paying the bills (she's dead, after all), but they have their own separate reasons for pursuing the truth, and very different ways of doing so. The trail leads from the low-rent life of Times Square's seediest peep shows to the chic halls of Bonton magazine, where the fashions are lipstick-glossy but the veneer of beauty is only skin deep.

        "Title": "That Man: An Insider's Portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt",
        "Authors": "By Jackson, Robert Houghwout, Barrett, John Q. (EDT), and Leuchtenburg, William E. (FRW)",
        "Description": "Robert H. Jackson was one of the giants of the Roosevelt era: an Attorney General, a still revered Supreme Court Justice and, not least important, one of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's close friends and advisers.  His intimate memoir of FDR, written in the early 1950s before Jackson's untimely death, has remained unpublished for fifty years. Here is that newly discovered memoir.      Written with skill and grace, this is truly a unique account of the personality, conduct, greatness of character, and common humanity of \"that man in the White House,\" as outraged conservatives called FDR. Jackson simply but eloquently provides an insider's view of Roosevelt's presidency, including such crucial events as FDR's Court-packing plan, his battles with corporate America, his decision to seek a third term, and his bold move to aid Britain in 1940 with American destroyers. He also offers an intimate personal portrait of Roosevelt--on fishing trips, in late-night poker games, or approving legislation while eating breakfast in bed, where he routinely began his workday. We meet a president who is far-sighted but nimble in attacking the problems at hand; principled but flexible; charismatic and popular but unafraid to pick fights, take stands, and when necessary, make enemies.       That Man is not simply a valuable historical document, but an engaging and insightful look at one of the most remarkable men in American history. In reading this memoir, we gain not only a new appreciation for Roosevelt, but also admiration for Jackson, who emerges as both a public servant of great integrity and skill and a wry, shrewd, and fair-minded observer of politics at the highest level.",

        "Title": "Winchell: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity",
        "Authors": "By Gabler, Neal",
        "Description": "Walter Winchell escaped New York-immigrant poverty via the vaudeville stage, his massive insecurity and ambition driving him on. But it was as a young newspaperman that he found his real calling. In 1925, at a time when most newspaper editors were reluctant to publish even the notice of an impending birth for fear of crossing the boundaries of good taste, Winchell brought unabashed and undisguised gossip into the public press. He understood the bitter subtext of gossip: how invading the lives of the famous and revealing their secrets empowered both purveyor and audience. His columns revealed who was cavorting with gangsters or chorus girls, who was engaging in financial shenanigans, whose husband was compromisingly sighted with whose wife. By legitimizing gossip he forever shattered the taboo against what could be said about celebrities in the media. In his own words: \"Democracy is where everybody can kick everybody else's ass.\" Adding: \"But you can't kick Winchell's.\"Because Winchell was present at the creation of celebrity as we now know it, because he reached the top and tumbled precipitously, an examination of his life illustrates how fame is achieved, how it is lost, what one gains from it, what it exacts - and why America is obsessed with it. \"Historians,\" said a speaker at his funeral, \"will be unable to explain the twentieth century without understanding Winchell.\" His life and his films are richly recaptured - and understood - in Neal Gabler's brilliant biography.",

Divided We Stand reveals the coming together and eruption of four volatile elements: super-tall buildings, financial speculation, globalization, and terrorism. The Trade Center serves as a potent symbol of the disastrous consequences of undemocratic planning and development.This book is a history of that skyscraping ambition and the impact it had on New York and international life. It is a portrait of a building complex that lives at the convergence point of social and economic realities central not only to New York City but to all industrial cities and suburbs. A meticulously researched historical account based on primary documents, Divided We Stand is a contemporary indictment of the prevailing urban order in the spirit of Jane Jacobs\u2019s mid-century classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities.",
