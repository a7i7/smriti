        "Description": "Originally published in 1909, this biography by Isabel Wallace recounts the life of her adoptive father, the little-recognized William Hervy Lamme Wallace, the highest-ranking Union officer to fall at the battle of Shiloh.Born in 1821 in Ohio, Wallace and his family moved to Illinois in 1834, where he was educated at Rock Springs Seminary in Mount Morris. On his way to study law with Abraham Lincoln in Springfield in 1844, Wallace was persuaded by local attorney T. Lyle Dickey, a close friend of Lincoln, to join his practice in Ottawa instead. Wallace eventually married Dickey\u2019s daughter, Martha Ann, in 1851.When the Civil War broke out, both Wallace and Dickey immediately volunteered for service with the Eleventh Illinois, which assembled in Springfield. Wallace was elected as the unit\u2019s colonel; a successful lawyer, a friend of President Lincoln, a generation older than most privates, and an officer with Mexican War experience, he was entirely suited for such command. Wallace was appointed brigadier general for his performance at Fort Donelson, the first notable Union victory in the Civil War. Wallace\u2019s troops had saved the day, although the Eleventh Illinois had lost nearly two-thirds of its men. He then moved with his troops to Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, where Confederates launched a surprise attack on the forces of Major General Ulysses S. Grant at Shiloh Church on Sunday, April 6, 1862. Wallace, who held only temporary command of one of Grant\u2019s six divisions, fought bravely but was mortally wounded as he began to withdraw his men on the afternoon of the battle. His wife, who had arrived at Pittsburg Landing by steamer on the day of the battle, was at his side when he died three days later. Grant praised Wallace in 1868 as the equal of the best, if not the very best, of the Volunteer Generals with me at the date of his death.\u201dIsabel Wallace traces her father\u2019s life from his upbringing in Ottawa through his education, his service in the Mexican War, his law practice, his courtship of and marriage to her mother, and his service in the Eleventh Illinois until his mortal injury at Shiloh. She also details his funeral and her and her mother\u2019s life in the postwar years. Based on the copious letters and family papers of the general and his wife, the biography also provides historical information on federal politics of the period, including commentary on Lincoln\u2019s campaign and election and on state politics, especially regarding T. Lyle Dickey, Wallace\u2019s father-in-law and law partner, prominent Illinois politician, and associate of Lincoln. It is illustrated with fifteen black-and-white halftones.",

And what if, to further complicate things, you meet the love of your life and then lose her phone number? Then what if, after the impossible happens and you find her again, she's now about to marry a roguish lothario who is also your best friend? The complications don't end there for Peter Russell, the winning hero of James Collins' charming, generous, and romantic first novel. Part modern-day Jane Austen, part Tom Wolfe, Beginner's Greek is a romantic comedy of the highest order, with characters who are perfectly, charmingly real as they swerve and stumble from fairy tale to social satire and back again.",

It is 1913 and Leon Courtney, an ex-soldier turned professional hunter in British East Africa, guides the rich and powerful from America and Europe on big-game safaris. Leon had never sought fame, but an expedition alongside U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt has made him one of the most sought-after hunters on the continent. Soon, he finds that with celebrity comes not just wealth\u2014but also danger. Leon is recruited by his uncle Penrod Ballantyne, commander of the British forces in East Africa, to gather information on one of his clients: Count Otto von Meerbach, a German industrialist whose company builds aircraft and vehicles for the Kaiser's burgeoning army. While spying, Leon falls desperately in love with von Meerbach's beautiful and enigmatic mistress, Eva von Wellberg. On the eve of the World War, Leon stumbles on a plot by Count von Meerbach that could wipe out the British forces in Africa. He finds himself left alone to frustrate von Meerbach's plan, and in grave peril as he learns more about the enigmatic Eva. Set amidst the tensions that will spark a war across continents, Assegai delivers the fast-paced action and vivid history that has made Wilbur Smith an internationally bestselling author.",

        "Title": "Central Europe: Enemies, Neighbors, Friends",
        "Authors": "By Johnson, Lonnie R.",
        "Description": "Throughout the Cold War era, the Iron Curtain divided Central Europe into a Communist East and a democratic West, and we grew accustomed to looking at this part of the world in bipolar ideological terms. Yet many people living on both sides of the Iron Curtain considered themselves Central Europeans, and the idea of Central Europe was one of the driving forces behind the revolutionary year of 1989 as well as the deterioration of Yugoslavia and its ensuing wars. Central Europe provides a broad overview and comparative analysis of key events in a historical region that encompasses contemporary Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia. Starting with the initial conversion of the \"pagan\" peoples of the region to Christianity around 1000 A.D. and concluding with the revolutions of 1989 and the problems of post-Communist states today, it illuminates the distinctive nature and peculiarities of the historical development of this region as a cohesive whole. Lonnie R. Johnson introduces readers to Central Europe's heritage of diversity, the interplay of its cultures, and the origins of its malicious ethnic and national conflicts. History in Central Europe, he shows, has been epic and tragic. Throughout the ages, small nations struggled valiantly against a series of imperial powers--Ottoman Turkey, Habsburg Austria, imperial Germany, czarist Russia, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union--and they lost regularly. Johnson's account is present-minded in the best sense: in describing actual historical events, he illustrates the ways they have been remembered, and how they contribute to the national assumptions that still drive European politics today. Indeed, the constant interplay of reality and myth--the processes of myth-making and remembrance--animates much of this history.  Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, the unanticipated problems of transforming post-Communist states into democracies with market economies, the wars in the former Yugoslavia, and the challenges of European integration have all made Central Europe the most dynamic and troubled region in Europe. In Central Europe, Johnson combines a vivid and panoramic narrative of events, a nuanced analysis of social, economic, and political developments, and a thoughtful portrait of those myths and memories that have lives of their own--and consequences for all of Europe.",

The only ice cream flavors are Mustard Meringue, Poultry Platter, and Cookies 'n' Cauliflower. And old folks use cats to keep themselves warm at night.\" In this collection of McPherson's cartoons, High School Isn't Pretty, he explores the netherworld of adolescence and young adulthood, that time in everyone's life when the quest for coolness prevails over all other impulses. And McPherson looks at this world differently than the rest of us do: He notices the oddities, the idiosyncrasies, the inconsistencies that make us human and make us laugh. His oddball characters and unusual situations strike a universal chord because they present a distorted mirror of ourselves. High school was never this much fun!",

        "Authors": "By Hochadel, MaryAnne (EDT)",
        "Description": "Mid-life and older Americans look first to AARP as a trusted source of the vital information that will improve their lives. Month to month and year to year, the association's 36 million members read and rely upon its magazines, its newspapers, its book-publishing division, and its website (aarp.org). When AARP says something, they know you can take that information to the bank. That's why book buyers will turn to this lavish manual for answers to their questions about life-saving-and life-enhancing-medications. The AARP Guide to Pills has been assembled with the same degree of care and concern for accuracy and ease of use that distinguishes every product that bears the AARP brand. That rigorous quality control will likewise distinguish the pill guide from the competition.It's the most outstanding and up-to-date guide to pills and medications ever published. The only one of its kind in full color, The AARP Guide to Pills addresses the needs and concerns of 50+ adults in incredible depth. To simplify the process of finding information about a certain drug, generic drugs are presented in a logical A-to-Z organization, with a comprehensive index that includes cross-references to related brand-name drugs. All information has been vetted by a board of content specialists, including an expert from the University of Southern California's School of Gerontology, considered the finest in the United States.Each entry also features a detailed, color-correct image of the pill or capsule for identification purposes, along with details on its generic name, brand name, and manufacturer; a listing of what a health-care provider should know about the condition of anyone taking the medication; advice on what to do if you miss a dose; warnings on interactions with other drugs; and notes on potential side effects to look out for.In their foreword and introduction, Harvard-trained doctors Jerry Avorn and Bill Thomas provide clear and comprehensive guidance on the wise use of prescription medications; how to effectively manage your drug costs; how to prepare for and derive maximum benefit from each doctor's visit; how to talk to your physician and pharmacist; how to avoid \"polypharmacy,\" or overmedication; and why the appearance of generic pills can change from one prescription refill to the next.This is a must-have book for anyone 50+ and younger.Why THIS pill book? *Each entry includes a color-correct image of the medication-unlike most books that include the images in a separate section*Over 1,200 color images of pills-more than any other book on the market-make identifying medications easy and minimize the risk of error...whether brand name or generic*A bulleted list tells you what your health-care professional needs to know before you start taking a specific drug*Important details about how and when to take a drug for maximum effectiveness*A separate section explains exactly what to do if you miss a dose*Content updated at press time to guarantee the most current information available*Concise and consistent format helps readers find what they need easily*Explains how the older body metabolizes drugs differently",

        "Authors": "By De Lint, Charles",
        "Description": "In the Old Country, they called them the Gentry: ancient spirits of the land, magical, amoral, and dangerous. When the Irish emigrated to North America, some of the Gentry followed...only to find that the New World already had spirits of its own, called manitou and other such names by the Native tribes.Now generations have passed, and the Irish have made homes in the new land, but the Gentry still wander homeless on the city streets. Gathering in the city shadows, they bide their time and dream of power. As their dreams grow harder, darker, fiercer, so do the Gentry themselves--appearing, to those with the sight to see them, as hard and dangerous men, invariably dressed in black.Bettina can see the Gentry, and knows them for what they are. Part Indian, part Mexican, she was raised by her grandmother to understand the spirit world. Now she lives in Kellygnow, a massive old house run as an arts colony on the outskirts of Newford, a world away from the Southwestern desert of her youth. Outsider her nighttime window, she often spies the dark men, squatting in the snow, smoking, brooding, waiting. She calls them los lobos, the wolves, and stays clear of them--until the night one follows her to the woods, and takes her hand....Ellie, an independent young sculptor, is another with magic in her blood, but she refuses to believe it, even though she, too, sees the dark men. A strange old woman has summoned Ellie to Kellygnow to create a mask for her based on an ancient Celtic artifact. It is the mask of the mythic Summer King--another thing Ellie does not believe in. Yet lack of belief won't dim the power of the mast, or its dreadful intent.Donal, Ellie's former lover, comes from an Irish family and knows the truth at the heart of the old myths. He thinks he can use the mask and the \"hard men\" for his own purposes. And Donal's sister, Miki, a punk accordion player, stands on the other side of the Gentry's battle with the Native spirits of the land. She knows that more than her brother's soul is at stake. All of Newford is threatened, human and mythic beings alike.Once again Charles de Lint weaves the mythic traditions of many cultures into a seamless cloth, bringing folklore, music, and unforgettable characters to life on modern city streets.",

        "Authors": "By Brooks, Terry",
        "Description": "The High Druid of Shannara trilogy draws to a thrilling close as a young hero nears completion of his trial by fire, a banished ruler fights for her life in a wilderness of dread, and forces of darkness and light square off in a battle unto death for the right to absolute rule. Prepare to be spellbound by the masterly hand of bestselling legend weaver Terry Brooks, conjuring at the peak of his skills.For reasons known only to himself, the King of the Silver River has charged young Penderrin Ohmsford, barely more than a boy, with the daunting task of rescuing his aunt, Grianne, Ard Rhys of the Druid order, from her forced exile in the terrifying dimension of all things damned: the Forbidding. With the noble dwarf Tagwen and the prodigal elven princess Khyber Elessedil by his side\u2013and with the outcome of the bloody war between the Federation and the Free-born at stake\u2013Pen has accepted his mission without question. But not without risk . . . or sacrifice.Because Shadea a\u2019Ru, the ruthless Druid responsible for imprisoning the true Ard Rhys and usurping leadership at Paranor, has sent her agents and assassins in relentless pursuit of Pen and his comrades. And in securing the talisman he needs to breach the Forbidding, Pen has paid a devastating price. Now if the Free-born forces\u2013already decimated by the Federation\u2019s death-dealing new weapon\u2013should fall, Shadea\u2019s domination of the Four Lands will be assured. Nothing short of Pen\u2019s success can turn the tide. But Pen\u2019s challenge grows greater when he learns that his parents, Bek Ohmsford and Rue Meridian, have fallen into Shadea\u2019s hands. He must try to help them\u2013but once within the walls of Druid\u2019s Keep, where Shadea\u2019s minions and dark magic lurk at every turn, Pen\u2019s survival is far from assured. Yet it will all pale in comparison to the horrors that wait inside the Forbidding\u2013horrors poised to break free upon the Four Lands when the time is right. . . .",

        "Description": "A New York Times Best-Seller Honeymooners Viktor and Liesel Landauer are filled with the optimism and cultural vibrancy of central Europe of the 1920s when they meet modernist architect Rainer von Abt. He builds for them a home to embody their exuberant faith in the future, and the Landauer House becomes an instant masterpiece.\u00a0 Viktor and Liesel, a rich Jewish mogul married to a thoughtful, modern gentile, pour all of their hopes for their marriage and budding family into their stunning new home, filling it with children, friends, and a generation of artists and thinkers eager to abandon old-world European style in favor of the new and the avant-garde. But as life intervenes, their new home also brings out their most passionate desires and darkest secrets. As Viktor searches for a warmer, less challenging comfort in the arms of another woman, and Liesel turns to her wild, mischievous friend Hana for excitement, the marriage begins to show signs of strain. The radiant honesty and idealism of 1930 quickly evaporate beneath the storm clouds of World War II. As Nazi troops enter the country, the family must leave their old life behind and attempt to escape to America before Viktor's Jewish roots draw Nazi attention, and before the family itself dissolves.As the Landauers struggle for survival abroad, their home slips from hand to hand, from Czech to Nazi to Soviet possession and finally back to the Czechoslovak state, with new inhabitants always falling under the fervent and unrelenting influence of the Glass Room. Its crystalline perfection exerts a gravitational pull on those who know it, inspiring them, freeing them, calling them back, until the Landauers themselves are finally drawn home to where their story began.Brimming with barely contained passion and cruelty, the precision of science, the wild variance of lust, the catharsis of confession, and the fear of failure - the Glass Room contains it all.",

        "Title": "The Battle for America 2008: The Story of an Extraordinary Election",
        "Authors": "By Johnson, Haynes and Balz, Dan",
        "Description": "The definitive account of the landmark election from two of America's best known political reportersThe election of 2008 shattered political barriers, illuminated undercurrents of race, gender, and class, and ignited an extraordinary battle among some of the most formidable political rivals ever to seek the presidency in Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John McCain. It was an election that played out against a backdrop of wars, a shattered economy, and deep pessimism about the future. Dan Balz and Haynes Johnson followed this campaign from the candidates' first forays into Iowa and New Hampshire to the historic night of Obama's victory celebration. They take readers on a gripping journey through the epic battle for Iowa, Clinton's dramatic comeback in New Hampshire, the racially tinged primary in South Carolina, the stunning endorsement of Obama by Senator Edward M. Kennedy over the Clintons' objections. They reveal the strategic mistakes of the Clinton campaign and the story behind Obama's breakthrough organization. They cover McCain's struggle for survival in the Republican primaries, Sarah Palin, and the economic meltdown that ensured Obama's victory. Exclusive interviews with the candidates and their top strategists produce intimate portraits of Obama, Clinton, and McCain under stress throughout the longest and most expensive presidential campaign in American history. Balz and Johnson also move far off the campaign trail to listen to voters in battleground states express their deep anxieties about the darkening economic climate and the challenges facing the United States. This book is a riveting account of how this election not only marked a new era in American politics but also offered a test of historic proportions at a watershed moment for our nation.",

        "Title": "Beyond the Frame: Impressionism Revisited",
        "Authors": "By Levy, David C. (FRW) and Johnson, J. Seward",
        "Description": "J. Seward Johnson, Jr., is best known for his life-size and lifelike cast-bronze sculptures of everyday people that inhabit parks and other public spaces around the country and around the world. Now Johnson has turned his hand to re-creating famous Impressionist paintings in three dimensions. His life-size tableaux of Manet's Olympia, van Gogh's The Bedroom, Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party, and many other iconic paintings invite viewers to walk straight into these hallowed scenes. At once thought-provoking and self-consciously over-the-top, Johnson's Beyond the Frame is the lead exhibition for fall 2003 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.Beyond the Frame illustrates the process Johnson uses to create his cast-aluminum tableaux, designed to withstand tactile exploration. Readers will also get to see the finished works, not only from the perspective that replicates the two-dimensional painting (the so-called sweet spot) but also from other angles that reveal behind-the-scenes touches introduced by Johnson. An essay by noted art historian Petra ten-Doesschate Chu considers Johnson's tableaux in the context of illusion and representation in art going back to the fifteenth century. A conversation between the artist Red Grooms and the curator Jacquelyn Days Serwer offers insight into the paradox of producing art for a public well beyond the art world. A pop-up of Manet's provocative Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe at the center of the book captures the playful spirit of the show.",
