        "Description": "Security consultant Peter Avakian's job is to keep people safe, and that's not always easy. Even his Special Forces training couldn't have prepared him for a routine business proposal that was anything but. By simply acknowledging the offer, Avakian becomes snarled in a complex plot to stage a political coup in central Africa. With no way out, he turns to the CIA\u2014and is forced to become their mole inside the conspiracy.Pulled into a shadow world of nations battling over the world's oil supply, drug dealers financing revolutions, and gunrunners on sale to the highest bidder, it's all Avakian can do to stay alive. And that may depend less on his lethal skills than on two women: a CIA agent and a South African reporter after a story. Will they save him, or will they betray him?It's anyone's guess, especially his.",

        "Authors": "By Friedman, Kinky",
        "Description": "The Mile High Club is a novel of intrigue, irreverence, international terrorism, humor, suspense, and cross-dressing, in which the intrepid Kinky Friedman gets more than his leg pulled when he encounters a mysterious vamp on an airplane.  It all starts with a casual flirtation, two people on a flight from Dallas to New York. She is gorgeous and mysterious; he is a private detective. When the plane lands, the detective -- our hero Kinky Friedman -- finds that he's been left holding the bag, in this case literally holding a bright pink cosmetic bag. The mysterious woman, having asked the Kinkster to watch her luggage while she visits the dumpster, has taken a powder and somehow has vanished.  Confident that he'll find the mystery woman again, Kinky holds on to the bag. Sure enough she does turn up, but not before Kinky has excited the interest of an array of \"suits\" from the State Department, been party to a thwarted kidnap attempt by Arab terrorists, and found a dead Israeli agent parked on the toilet of his downtown Manhattan loft.  Employing the able-bodied assistance of his usual sidekicks, the Village Irregulars, Kinky eventually gets to the bottom of all the comings and goings and comings of the many visitors to his loft -- including two late-night visits by the mysterious, and suddenly affectionate, woman from the plane and one not-so-late visit by her angry brother. Before it's over, the bag is gone.  Despite the many comparisons made by the critics, citing his resemblance to one great writer after another, the truth is that no other writer combines intriguing mystery with bawdy one-liners quite like Kinky Friedman. Alternately raunchy, offbeat, and hilarious, The Mile High Club, complete with a surprise ending, is Kinky at his very considerable best.",

It seems Her Honor is a tad concerned that little old ladies in the area are dropping dead at an alarming rate. Fearing something foul is afoot, she persuades Kinky to undertake some sleuthing.Undaunted by the thought of running up against the toughest lady sheriff in Texas and only a little perturbed by a mass of swarming bees, the Kinkster takes off in his talking car to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Several bunches of yellow roses and a faded photograph taken many years ago of ten pretty girls dressed in white and ready for the cotillion are just the clues Kinky needs to finally unravel a devious scheme of revenge for personal wrongs and social snobbery.A colorful Texas story of the cosmic variety, Armadillos & Old Lace is Kinky Friedman at his dead-level best, mixing his irresistible irreverence with a really great mystery.",

        "Authors": "By Bodansky, Yossef",
        "Description": "In the months leading up to March 2003, fresh from its swift and heady victory in Afghanistan, the Bush administration mobilized the United States armed forces to overthrow the government of Iraq. Eight months after the president declared an end to major combat operations, Saddam Hussein was captured in a farmhouse in Al-Dawr. And yet neither peace nor democracy has taken hold in Iraq; instead the country has plunged into terrorist insurgency and guerrilla warfare, with no end in sight.What went wrong?In The Secret History of the Iraq War, bestselling author Yossef Bodansky offers an astonishing new account of the war and its aftermath\u2014a war that was doomed from the start, he argues, by the massive and systemic failures of the American intelligence community. Drawing back the curtain of politicized debate, Bodansky\u2014a longtime expert and director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare\u2014reveals that nearly every aspect of America's conflict with Iraq has been misunderstood, in both the court of public opinion and the White House itself. Among his revelations:The most authoritative account of Saddam Hussein's support for Islamic terrorist organizations\u2014including extensive new reporting on his active cooperation with al-Qaeda in Iraq long after the fall of BaghdadExtensive new information on Iraq's major chemical and biological weapons programs\u2014including North Korea's role in building still-undetected secret storage facilities and Iraq's transfer of banned materials to Syria, Iran, and Libya The first account of Saddam's plan for Iraq, Syria, and Iran to join Yasser Arafat's Palestinian forces to attack Israel, throw the region into turmoil, and upend the American campaignThe untold story of Russia's attempt to launch a coup against Saddam before the war\u2014and how the CIA thwarted it by ensuring that Iraq was forewarnedDramatic details about Saddam's final days on the run, including the untold story of a near miss with U.S. troops and the stunning revelation that Saddam was already in custody at the time of his capture\u2014and was probably betrayed by members of his own Tikriti clanThe definitive account of the anti-U.S. resistance and uprising in Iraq, as the American invasion ignited an Islamic jihad and Iran-inspired intifada, threatening to plunge the region into irreversible chaos fueled by hatred and revengeRevelations about the direct involvement of Osama bin Laden in the terrorism campaigns in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the Middle East\u2014including the major role played by Iran and HizbAllah in al-Qaeda's operationsDrawing upon an extraordinary wealth of previously untapped intelligence and regional sources, The Secret History of the Iraq War presents the most detailed, fascinating, and convincing account of the most controversial war of our times\u2014and offers a sobering indictment of an intelligence system that failed the White House, the American military, and the people of the Middle East.",

        "Authors": "By Lewin, Roger",
        "Description": "In Patterns in Evolution, noted science journalist Roger Lewin explores how genetic information is providing new insight into evolutionary events: scientists are now able to study evolutionary change at the molecular level and reconstruct evolutionary lineages based on changes in DNA. With this new ability, they are overthrowing established ideas about which organisms are closely related and solving puzzles that had previously seemed beyond their reach. Lewin looks at how these new techniques are being used to explore a wide range of issues, from those regarding the deepest past to those concerned with the most recent present - from characterizing the universal ancestor of all life to tracking the trail of infection of the AIDS virus. The techniques have proved especially useful to anthropologists in their attempts to unravel the origins, both ancient and modern, of the human species.Evolutionary biologists put the new genetic tools to especially creative use in their studies of ecology and animal behavior, which lead to fresh perspectives on why species diverge and new species emerge. Lewin shows how the tools are supplying answers to questions as diverse as why some turtles migrate thousands of miles to breed, why species have particular mating patterns, and how the interplay of geology and climate determine the evolution of new species.Finally, Lewin looks at how scientists are resurrecting the DNA from animals long dead, including 5000-year-old mummies and 95-million-year-old insects trapped in amber, to give concrete answers to questions about the past. He shows how wolf skins stored in museums are guiding conservation efforts, how human remains from thousands of years ago are shedding light on ancient mating patterns, and how long-buried fossils are tempting scientists to undertake the challenge of recovering dinosaur DNA. A skilled storyteller, Roger Lewin brings to vivid life the investigations that are revealing not just the history of life, but the mechanisms of its evolution.",

        "Authors": "By Pond, Elizabeth",
        "Description": "The rejuvenation of Europe as a totalitarian century ends and a global century begins is a remarkable story. This book brings together the three dynamics of Europe's position at this extraordinary moment: European monetary union, the deepening of intra-EU cooperation, and the widening of the EU and NATO to take in central European members. It looks at the broad political and policy implications of EMU and shows how the United States views this integration. Elizabeth Pond, a longtime observer of events in Europe and Russia, sees these developments as the beginning of a new postnational European system that is replacing the centuries-old nation-state system. She shows how belligerence and anarchy have faded away on the European continent as compulsory cold war cooperation becomes a habit and as French-German reconciliation becomes the pattern for reconciliation between other old enemies. She follows NATO's transformation into a reluctant peacemaker in Bosnia and the United States' decision to remain a European power. She describes the leap of faith needed to create European monetary union and charts the magnetic attraction of both NATO and the EU in shaping the democratic, economic, and social revolutions in central Europe. She warns about the strains that will face the transatlantic relationship when the euro is on a par with the dollar as a reserve currency. And she concludes by agreeing with former Polish foreign minister Wladyslaw Barteszewski that we are witnessing, after the original birth of European consciousness a millennium ago, the rebirth of Europe.",

        "Title": "Fast Cycle Time: How to Align Purpose, Strategy, and Structure for Speed",
        "Authors": "By Meyer, Christopher",
        "Description": "Today, tens of thousands of companies are struggling to become \"time-based\" competitors, inspired by such corporations as Motorola, General Electric, Citicorp, and a myriad of others who have cut production time in half?or more. But until now, the literature has focused on the theory and philosophy of fast cycle time, rather than the tools and techniques for implementing it. Here, for the first time, Christopher Meyer, an internationally recognized expert in cycle time reduction, presents a step-by-step blueprint for transforming traditional companies into fast cycle competitors.  Meyer argues that fast cycle time is achieved not by working faster, but by aligning the organization's purpose, strategy and structure. He demonstrates how the product development cycle must become a learning laboratory in which the four continuous elements \"Design, Fabricate, Assemble, and Test\" are analyzed with the intent to improve strategy in the next business cycle. Analyzing strategy and core processes enables management to detect and correct problems earlier, and leverage knowledge for improved innovation and increased value for customers.  Employing an ongoing case study, Core Products, Inc., throughout the text, Meyer shows how to redesign the organization for manufacturability and assembly, how to implement multifunctional teams that work, how to analyze and map critical cycle time interdependencies such as \"co-location,\" and how to measure the impact of cycle time on business performance. Meyer's practical approach provides a simple methodology for organizations to deliver products to customers rapidly, accurately, and reliably.  \"Chris Meyer interrelates many pieces that we have all read about in different places into a coherent guide to making it happen. Ironically, as Meyer shows, implementing fast cycle time means almost the opposite of what most American managers are inclined to do...Many years of practical experience have shown Meyer and his colleagues the wisdom of a paradox?that to speed up you often have to slow down.\"  ?From the Foreword by Peter M.

        "Title": "Competing on the Edge : Strategy as Structured Chaos",
        "Authors": "By Brown, Shona L. and Eisenhardt, Kathleen M.",
        "Description": "Unstable markets, fierce competition, and relentless change are the only certainties in today's chaotic business world. In their startling new book, authors Brown and Eisenhardt contend that to prosper in such volatile conditions, standard survival strategies must be tossed aside in favor of a revolutionary new paradigm&#151;competing on the edge. To compete on the edge is to relentlessly reinvent, and it's the only way to navigate the treacherous waters of tumultuous markets. Competing on the edge is an unpredictable, sometimes even inefficient strategy, yet a singularly effective one in an era driven by change. It requires charting a course along the edge of chaos, where a delicate compromise is struck between anarchy and order, to the edge of time, where current business is the primary focus, but actions are shaped by past legacies and future opportunities. By adroitly maneuvering through chaos and time, managers can avoid constantly reacting to nonstop change and instead set a rhythmic pace that others must follow, thereby shaping the competitive landscape&#151;and their own destiny. In the first book to translate leading edge concepts from complexity theory into management practice, each chapter focuses on a specific management dilemma and illustrates a solution. Linking where do you want to go? With how will you get there? Here's a bold and surprising strategy that works&#151;when the name of the game is change.",

        "Title": "New Art City",
        "Authors": "By Perl, Jed",
        "Description": "A fascinating, panoramic exploration of art and culture in mid-twentieth-century New York City from one of our most important and influential art critics. New Art City takes us from the solitude of the artist\u2019s studio to the uproarious bars where artists gathered, from the ramshackle bohemian neighborhoods of downtown Manhattan to the Midtown streets where steel-and-glass skyscrapers were rising and art galleries were proliferating. We encounter a kaleidoscopic range of artists. There are legendary figures\u2013Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Willem de Kooning, Joseph Cornell, Andy Warhol, and Donald Judd\u2013as well as still undervalued ones, such as the galvanic teacher Hans Hofmann, the lyric expressionist Joan Mitchell, the adventuresome realist Fairfield Porter, and the eccentric thinker John Graham. We encounter, too, the writers, critics, patrons, and hangers-on who rounded out the artists\u2019 world. Jed Perl helps us see what the artists were creating and understand how they confronted an exploding art audience. And he makes clear how the economic boom of the late 1950s and the increasingly enthusiastic response to Abstract Expressionism ushered in the rapacious art world of the 1960s and the theatricality of Pop Art. Artists drew strength from the dizzying onslaught of Manhattan, and produced a tidal wave of new forms. These included Hofmann\u2019s brazen flourishes of color; Pollock\u2019s quicksilver skeins of paint unfurling panoramic arabesques; and the crushed, jagged, turning-back-on-itself calligraphy of de Kooning\u2019s gnomic alphabets. And there was much more: Burgoyne Diller\u2019s levitating rectangles; Nell Blaine\u2019s explosive renderings of quotidian scenes; Ellsworth Kelly\u2019s extraordinary simplifications, suggesting sails or semaphores. A brilliant tapestry of social history, biographical portraiture, and criticism, New Art City illuminates a revolutionary, unprecedented time and place in American culture.",

Jack was once a highly regarded ophthalmologist, but his career took a dramatic turn after a tragic accident destroyed his family. And that, too, is very much in the past: Jack has remarried - to longtime colleague and fellow medical examiner Laurie Montgomery - and is the father of a young child, who has unfortunately been diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer.No matter what stresses he faces, Jack's renegade, activist personality can't rest. After performing a postmortem on a promising young college graduate who had recently been treated by a chiropractor, Jack begins researching alternative medicine as a way to avoid obsessing about his child's illness. Quickly, he is confronted by the question of what makes some people step outside the medical establishment to seek help from therapies based on dubious science, Eastern philosophies, or even faith healers.Jack's classmate Shawn Daughtry is now a renowned archaeologist and biblical scholar. Brash, impetuous, and completely career-driven, Shawn makes a spectacular find at a souk in Cairo: an ancient codex, whose contents may vault him to international fame. His discovery takes him on a secret journey to what is held to be Saint Peter's tomb beneath the basilica in Rome, where he hopes to unearth a two-thousand-year-old ossuary, the contents of which may have earthshaking ecclesiastical and medical implications.Shawn can't wait to flaunt his treasure before his old college buddy James O'Rourke - now James Cardinal O'Rourke, bishop of the Archdiocese of New York: the treasure may jeopardize the very nature of papal infallibility. Desperate to protect his church and his own political ambitions, James turns to his friend Jack to help safeguard an explosive secret, one with the power to change lives forever.",

        "Authors": "By John F. Kennedy School of Government (COR), Donahue, John D. (EDT), and Council for Excellence in Government (COR)",
        "Description": "Everybody knows federal agencies are brain-dead leviathans. Everybody knows that the watchword of federal management is \"that's the way we've always done it.\" Everybody knows that any creativity within American government shows up only in the cities and states. Everybody's wrong.    In 1995 the Ford Foundation's annual \"Innovation in American Government\" award competition was opened up to federal candidates and a third of the winners since then have been federal institutions. This book profiles the 14 federal award winners from 1995 to 1998 and challenges the conventional wisdom about the federal bureaucracy's capacity to adapt. Examples include the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which figured out how to identify and act upon business and government's shared stake in keeping dangerous products out of consumers' hands; and the Wage and Hour inspectors in the Labor Department, who deployed market leverage to put pressure on the garment-industry scofflaws whose sweatshops had evaded conventional enforcement.    The stories show how pressure, promises, and professional pride can galvanize federal managers and front-line workers to overcome what are admittedly imposing impediments to change, and persevere with new ways to deliver on their missions. And they illustrate the unfashionable truth that innovation is within Washington's repertoire after all.    Copublished with the Council for Excellence in Government",

From ancient thinkers like Confucius, Aristotle, and Saint Augustine to great writers like Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, and G. B. Shaw to modern social observers like Woody Allen and Lily Tomlin, Oxymoronica celebrates the power and beauty of paradoxical thinking. All areas of human activity are explored, including love, sex and romance, politics, the arts, the literary life, and, of course, marriage and family life.

        "Description": "In Paula Deen's The Deen Family Cookbook, Paula and the Deens, Hiers, Groovers, and Orts share their recipes and memories.\u201cMany of the bonds my family has were forged over the dinner table and through the sharing of recipes. Cooking is the way we express our love for one another....I feel so lucky and blessed by the strong support and wonderful memories\u2014and the incredible recipes\u2014that my family has brought me. They are the heart and soul of this book.\u201d \u2014from the Introduction Nothing is more important to Paula Deen than her family, and nothing makes that big family happier than sitting down to a meal together. Paula's beloved Aunt Peggy makes an Old-Fashioned Meat Loaf that's as good in sandwiches the next day as it is for dinner. Baby brother Bubba Hiers brings his Beer and Onion Biscuits to the table, and his daughter, Corrie, makes a simple but luscious Lemony, Buttery Baked Fish that's perfect for a weeknight dinner. (Her Carrot-Pecan Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting are pretty tasty, too!) Son Jamie makes Huevos Rancheros, perfect for brunch, or try Bobby's Whole Wheat and Honey Pancakes. Husband Michael Groover knows his way around a grill: try his Company's Coming Grilled Steak and Veggie Supper for easy entertaining, and finish the evening with his Irish Coffee. Of course, there was no way The Lady herself was going to let her relatives have all the fun: Paula is, after all, Paula. She shares her recipe for the Ham and Chutney Biscuit Fingers she puts on the table at every family party as well as the Eggplant and Sausage Lasagna that went a long way toward getting the boys to eat their vegetables. And while there's plenty of butter, bacon, and mayonnaise in these pages, you'll find some of the lighter recipes that Paula enjoys, too: Seared Scallops with Pineapple-Cucumber Salsa is her first choice for a healthful but romantic supper with Michael, and Oven-Fried Chicken Breasts with Honey-Yogurt Drizzle lets Paula indulge in her favorite foods without guilt and with room for dessert. With more than 140 recipes and dozens of beautiful color photographs, there's something here for everyone. So invite over all those aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends, and treat them to some home cooking, Deen family style.",

        "Authors": "By Furgurson, Ernest B.",
        "Description": "Freedom Rising is a fresh, intensely human account of how the Civil War transformed the nation\u2019s capital from the debating forum for a loose union of states into the seat of a forceful central government. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before 1861, Washington was a dusty, muddy city of 60,000, joked about by urban sophisticates from New York and Boston. But at the onset of war, thousands of soldiers, job seekers, nurses, good-time girls, gamblers, newly freed slaves\u2013all kinds of Americans\u2013poured in. For days, Washington was cut off from the North, and no one was sure whether it would become the capital of the Union or the Confederacy. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ernest Furgurson\u2013author of the widely acclaimed Chancellorsville 1863, Ashes of Glory, and Not War but Murder\u2013tells the story through the men and women who brought the city to rambunctious life. He re-creates historic figures such as William Seward, who fancied himself Abraham Lincoln\u2019s prime minister; poet Walt Whitman, who nursed the wounded; and detective Allan Pinkerton, who tracked down Southern sympathizers; and he introduces intriguing others, such as Mayor James Berret, arrested for disloyalty; architect Thomas Walter, striving to finish the Capitol dome in the middle of war; and accused Confederate spy Antonia Ford, romancing her captor, Union Major Joseph Willard, operator of the capital\u2019s premier hotel. \u00a0Here is Mary Lincoln, mourning the death of her son Willie, seeking solace from fakers who conducted s\u00e9ances in the White House. And here is the president\u2013in all his compassion, determination, and complexity\u2013inspiring the nation, wrangling with generals, pardoning deserters, and barely escaping death on the ramparts of Fort Stevens as Jubal Early\u2019s Southern army invades the outskirts of Washington and fights the Union Army within five miles of the White House. For four years, the city was awash in drama and sometimes comedy, until the assassination of Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth became the tragedy of the century. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the time the grand two-day victory parade of 150,000 troops surged along Pennsylvania Avenue, the men and women who had arrived in such great numbers at the start of the war had made Washington a capital to be reckoned with throughout the world. Freedom Rising is an  invaluable aid to understanding the making of America.",

        "Description": "A fascinating exploration of the mysterious, perfectly preserved Caucasian mummies of western China. In the museums of \u00e5r?mchi, the windswept regional capital of the Uyghur Autonomous Region in Western China-what we know as Chinese Turkestan-a collection of ancient mummies lay at the center of an enormous mystery. Some of \u00e5r?mchi's mummies date back as far as 4,000 years-contemporary to the famous Egyptian mummies, but even more beautifully preserved, especially their clothing. Surprisingly, these prehistoric people are not Oriental but Caucasian-tall and large-nosed and blond with round eyes (probably blue). Where did they come from? What were these blonds doing in the foothills of the Himalayas? Few gifts are put into the graves of the dead, making it difficult for archaeologists to pinpoint any cultural connections from clues offered by their pottery and tools. But their clothing-woolens that rarely survive more than a few centuries-has been preserved as brightly hued as the day each was made. Elizabeth Wayland Barber describes these remarkable mummies, their clothing, and the world to which they so mysteriously belonged, piecing together their history and peculiar Western connections both from what she saw in \u00e5r?mchi and from the testimony of those who explored along the Silk Road centuries earlier. The result is an entertaining and informative unveiling of an ancient and exotic world.",

It was a seminal period in the history of the United States and the world. But the American side of the story has remained largely untold, America's contribution to the war maligned or ignored, both at home and in Europe.Nineteen ninety-seven marks the eightieth anniversary of America's entry into the war. This book combines American, British, and French archival material to present a fresh and modern evaluation of America's performance - and the scars the experience of war left behind.",

        "Description": "\"A perfect guide to getting the non-essentials out of the way, so that simple joys can make their way into our lives.\" - Marianne Williamson, author of A Return to Love\"If you want to grow, you gotta let go,\" is the mantra that bestselling author, columnist, and life coach Gail Blanke lives by. That means eliminating all the clutter - physical and emotional - that holds you back, weighs you down, or just makes you feel bad about yourself.In THROW OUT FIFTY THINGS she takes us through each room of the house - from the attic to the garage - and even to the far reaches of our minds.  Through poignant and humorous stories, she inspires us to get rid of the \"life plaque\" we've allowed to build-up there.    That junk drawer (you know that drawer) in the kitchen? Empty it!   Those old regrets? Throw 'em out!   That make-up from your \"old\" look? Toss it!   That relationship that depresses you? Dump it!  Once you've hit fifty (you'll be surprised how easy it is to get there) and once you've thrown out that too-tight belt and too-small view of yourself, you'll be ready to step out into the clearing and into the next, and greatest, segment of your life.",
