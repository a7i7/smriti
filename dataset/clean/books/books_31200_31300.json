Sensible planning; timed development; and open international policy, instigated in the 1980s, have helped to create a progressive and flourishing country against the odds. To the extent that you could easily think you were in the South of France rather than in Africa, with its cosmopolitan feel. Geyer writes that she has seen nothing as spectacular as the Tunisian development policy put into action. Accounts of the author's firsthand experiences from traveling in Tunisia not only feature descriptions about Tunisia's visible achievements but also accounts of the people, their mind set, and way of life. Tunisia is a fine example of a living success story for the tourist as well as the social scientist.",

        "Description": "Anna Quindlen first visited London from a chair in her suburban Philadelphia home. \"'The city streets were filled with fog and the cobbled pavers were slightly slick with moisture, so that the man and woman struggling down the street slid on its surface. It was just after the war, and some of the buildings were empty holes left over from the blitz.' The book describing this was by Patricia Wentworth, one of a series of mystery novels she wrote that wind up always, inevitably, in the capital, at the cozy flat of the essential English spinster.\"Quindlen has been to London countless times since, in the pages of books. From Dickensian London, rich with narrow alleyways and jocular street vendors, to the London of Conan Doyle and Margery Allingham, with its salt-of-the-earth police officers and crowded train stations. She visited Victoria Station, Hyde Park, Soho, and Kensington in her imagination long before ever setting foot in the city. By the time Quindlen actually visited London in 1995, it was less like an introduction and more like a homecoming. Here, she thought, is where Evelyn Waugh's bright young things danced until dawn. Here is where foolish Lydia Bennett eloped with the dastardly Wickham. Here is where Oliver Twist sought his fortune, and where Adam Dalgliesh has his private flat. New York, Paris, and Dublin are vividly portrayed in fiction, but London has always been the star, both because of the primacy of English literature and the specificity of the city's descriptions. In Imagined London, Quindlen walks through the city, moving within blocks from the great books of the 18th century to the detective stories of the 20th to the new modernist tradition of the 21st.  Her book is about traveling and reading in a city in fact and a city in fiction and where and how the two cities intersect.",

They include: \"The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" one of Twain's most amusing pieces of folk humor, first published in 1865; \"The \u00a31,000,000 Bank Note,\" a lighthearted exploration of the power of money; \"The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg,\" a masterfully written short story about greed; and his last work, \"The Mysterious Stranger,\" a novelette published posthumously in 1916, presenting Twain's rather grim views of God, man, and the universe.",

        "Description": "The recent interpretation of Maya hieroglyphs has given us the first written history of the New World as it existed before the European invasion. In this book, two of the first central figures in the massive effort to decode the glyphs, Linda Schele and David Freidel, make this history available in all its detail. A Forest of Kings is the story of Maya kingship, from the beginning of its institution and the first great pyramid builders two thousand years ago to the decline of Maya civilization and its destruction by the Spanish. Here the great historic rulers of pre-Columbian civilization come to life again with the decipherment of their writing. At its height, Maya civilization flourished under great kings like Shield-Jaguar, who ruled for more than sixty years, expanding his kingdom and building some of the most impressive works of architecture in the ancient world. Long placed on a mist-shrouded pedestal as austere, peaceful stargazers, the Maya elites are now known to have been the rulers of populous, aggressive city-states. Hailed as \"a Rosetta stone of Maya civilization\" (Brian M. Fagan, author of People of the Earth), A Forest of Kings is \"a must for interested readers,\" says Evon Vogt, professor of anthropology at Harvard University.",

        "Title": "The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life",
        "Authors": "By Eisenberg, Lee",
        "Description": "Do you know your Number?What happens if you don't make it to your Number?Do you have a plan?The often-avoided, anxiety-riddled discussion about financial planning for a secure and fulfilling future has been given a new starting point in The Number by Lee Eisenberg. The buzz of professionals and financial industry insiders everywhere, the Number represents the amount of money and resources people will need to enjoy the active life they desire, especially post-career. Backed by imaginative reporting and insights, Eisenberg urges people to assume control and responsibility for their standard of living, and take greater aim on their long-term aspirations.In 1999, Eisenberg was in the midst of downshifting from having served as the Editor-in-Chief of Esquire and other high profile positions. He was \"half-in, half-out of the workplace\" with an enviable consulting position at Time, Inc., and a family comfortably settled in the suburbs. That's when he received an unexpected offer from the Wisconsin-based Lands' End which, in the end, he couldn't resist. It meant uprooting his family and moving to the rural heartland, and taking on the challenges of an entirely new way of life. Before the move, he admits, \"I was worried about the Number.\" Once in Wisconsin, Eisenberg confesses that the \"Number was leading us around by our noses.\" From Wall Street to Main Street USA, The Number means different things to different people. It is constantly fluctuating in people's minds and bank accounts. To some, the Number symbolizes freedom, validation of career success, the ticket to luxurious indulgences and spiritual exploration; to others, it represents the bewildering and nonsensical nightmare of an impoverished existence creeping up on them in their old age, a seemingly hopeless inevitability that they would rather simply ignore than confront. People are highly private and closed-mouthed when it comes to discussing their Numbers, or lack thereof, for fear they might either reveal too much or display ineptitude. In The Number, Eisenberg describes this secret anxiety as the \"Last Taboo,\" a conundrum snared in confusing financial lingo. He sorts through the fancy jargon and translates the Number into commonsense advice that resonates just as easily with the aging gods and goddesses of corporate boardrooms as it does with ordinary people who are beginning to realize that retirement is now just a couple of decades away. Believing that the Number is as much about self-worth as it is net worth, Eisenberg strives to help readers better understand and more efficiently manage all aspects of their life, money, and pursuit of happiness.* According to Eisenberg, \"Number chasers\" fall into four personality types: --\"Procrastinators\" enter their forties and fifties ensconced in a cloud of avoidance and denial about the years ahead of them, or simply do not understand investing in their futures. --\"Pluckers\" often lazily or arrogantly pull ephemeral, albeit specific, Numbers from thin air with little attention to developing a realistic and coherent plan to achieve their goals. --\"Plotters\" crunch every practical aspect of their financial history, hoping to cement their Number in black and white, even at the expense of not having fun and leisure.--\"Probers\" visualize their Numbers not as an end but as the means to pursuing dreams and passions, and completing inner and outer journeys to self-fulfillment.* The current \"Debt Warp\" is the \"silent Number killer that afflicts young and old\" that has been brought on by our \"whip-it-out credit-card culture.\"* The \"Lost Years\" describes a person's 20s, 30s, and 40s wherein sensible financial foundation-building bows to oblivious and careless spending, and the tug-of-war dichotomy between the \"old Rest of Your Life\" and the \"new Rest of Your Life.\"* A surprise \"Lifestyle Relapse\" attack around retirement age can be induced by debt, aging, long term care, and self-absorption. Living longer and spending more, people will eventually experience dire consequences in response to the debt-drenched, expense account-driven lifestyles to which they have grown accustomed.* The six tenets of the \"Eisenberg Uncertainty Principles\" outline the dubious state of living in a carpe diem-addicted, indebted culture with little financial guidance or responsibility. * \"Downshifting\" is an important skill one needs to know how to do in the expanse between leaving a career and before death in order to maintain financial stability and a happy life.Eisenberg's book is not an investment guide, but rather something wholly original: a revealing look behind our most common financial and emotional conflicts and how we can begin to get a grip on them. Eisenberg gives each reader a unique and unprecedented tool with which to virtually craft his or her future. This encompassing book is a priceless, step-by-step prelude to initiating, or continuing, discussions with a qualified financial advisor. The bottom line for The Number is that Eisenberg offers each reader a fresh and promising beginning to the rest of his or her life.",

As part of a stinging critique of the Democratic Party, Miller outlines key positions on important issues that can again make the party relevant for the entire nation. From tax cuts to welfare, gun control to the environment, the arts to education, immigration to terrorism, Miller identifies values that make sense to a growing majority of Americans.  Miller's candid analysis of the campaigns of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton further underscores his conclusion that the Democratic Party can no longer field a serious presidential challenge.  Many party loyalists will not like what Senator Miller writes; yet his credentials are beyond question, for few Democrats have worked longer or stronger for the party and its candidates.",
