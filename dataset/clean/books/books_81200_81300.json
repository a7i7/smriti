        "Description": "The author of How to Know God provides help for healing deep trauma\u2014whenever it arises\u2014so we may find peace in ourselves and in our world.Terror came from the sky, and afterward the world would never be the same. September, 11, 2001, defined tragedy for a generation. On that day Deepak Chopra found himself driving from city to city, meeting thousands of people who begged for meaning and solace in the face of suffering. In response he has written The Deeper Wound, offering a way of healing as a memorial to the thousands of victims who perished.The opening section, \u201cIn the Face of Tragedy,\u201d defines suffering as the pain that threatens to make life meaningless. When our deepest needs go unfulfilled, suffering begins. We begin to heal when we go beyond personal anger and fear to a realization of our true self, the self that was never afraid and can never be wounded.The true self contains the light that no darkness can attack. Having described a path of awareness and compassion that leads to the light, the second half ofThe Deeper Wound takes us there through \u201cA Hundred Days of Healing,\u201d daily affirmations, exercises, insights, lessons, and questions\u2014each a step out of pain toward a higher reality. \u201cWe can become living memorials to tragedy by restoring the power of life,\u201d writes Deepak Chopra. \u201cYou are that life, you are that power. Let us see if we can find the spark that will make the spiritual flame spring up.\u201dHealing yourself comes in two stages\u2014first releasing the energy of suffering, then replacing it with the soul\u2019s energy. It is a gentle and fragile path, very much like holding on to a thread as it leads you from step to step.If you take the time to listen to the voice of silence, you will be astonished at the power you have at your command, however long that power has been overlooked.A portion of the proceeds earned by the author and publisher from the sale of this book will be donated to the Red Cross to aid in humanitarian relief efforts around the world.",

        "Description": "This book owes its existence to a need felt, we believe, by many people who are trying to teach European prehistory, for an elementary textbook suitable for students taking their first course in the subject with little or no previous experience in archeology. Several years of struggling with the literature in its present form finally convinced us that there was no alternative but to write it for ourselves. The primary evidence, where published at all, is notoriously scattered through a bewildering range of books, pamphlets and journals, written in almost every European language and in any case frequently unobtainable except in a few specialist libraries. For some areas and periods secondary works, sometimes excellent, exist, but their coverage if far from complete and they are mostly at too advanced a level for first-year students. Some general books exist, but none covers the chronological and geographical range that we thought desirable, with a proper concentration on the themes characteristic of modern archaeology at a level suitable for our intended readership.",

        "Authors": "By Gibson, Rowan, Handy, Charles",
        "Description": "This volume provides insights from business thinkers on their visions of tomorrow. Powerful new forces are reshaping the world today. Traditional boundaries between industries and disciplines are rapidly blurring, and the old rules of management no longer make sense in a post-industrial world. This book looks at how organizations can be redesigned to survive and thrive in tomorrow's hyper-competitive global environment; how they can learn to adapt to change and improve their performance; and how they should be \"managed\", if at all. It examines the changing role of the leader and the powerful influence of corporate culture. It probes the universal principles and values that ultimately govern the success of any leader or organization. It also looks at strategies for creating tomorrow's competitive advantage and tomorrow's markets. It offers a glipse of the future of marketing, which will be driven by new demographics, new global markets and new technology. Most importantly of all, the book gives readers a framework for understanding the big picture. It provides a panoramic perspective that puts all the pieces together in a coherent and easily understandable context. Tomorrow's executives will need to understand business at a far more global and synergistic level than ever before, and to feel comfortable leading people who have learned to manage themselves. Contributors include Stephen Covey, Charles Handy, Michael Porter, Gary Hamel, C.K. Prahalad, Al Ries and Jack Trout, Philip Kotler, Regis McKenna, Michael Hammer, Eli Goldratt, Peter Senge, John Kotter, Warren Bennis, John Naisbitt, Lester Thurow and Kevin Kelly.",

        "Description": "A mere toe-dip into the National Archives' vast holdings, \"Dear Mr. President\" presents a delirious potpourri of letters for perusal. The epistolary arts are every voyeur's secret pleasure, and the most public of public offices compels people of all walks of life, from children to the working man to the very famous, to put pen to paper. This carefully selected batch of letters, from over one hundred years of archiving letters to the President, includes such gems as the letter from a ten-year-old Fidel Castro to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 requesting ten bucks; an offer from Annie Oakley to President McKinley to raise a company of fifty American lady sharpshooters in the event of a war with Spain; a scrawled note on American Airlines in-flight letterhead from Elvis Presley to Richard Nixon offering his services to fight \"The Hippie Elements;\" and a very moving letter about the state of civil rights from Jackie Robinson to President Eisenhower. The book opens with a 5,000-word introduction by Thomas Mallon, a well-known figure who can place these letters in the American consciousness and give some further information on some of them. The letters themselves are reproduced where possible as full-size facsimiles and are accompanied with commentary to help the reader place them within historical events. Some archival photos will also run with the letters, in cases where we have photos of the writer and the President together.",

He's done his dot-com homework and launches his own start-up, Artemis-5.com, with the key ingredients for success - technology so cutting-edge it's barely decipherable, a world-class board of directors whose credentials command a lemming-like public following, and carefully orchestrated Street buzz of epic proportions.Jubal Thurgren, assistant director of enforcement for the Security and Exchange Commission and a man of Columbo-like intelligence and personality, smells a rat. Even as the buzz increases, Thurgren's instincts tell him that Artemis-5, which has yet to reveal any substantive products or services, may not be quite what Hanley has cracked it up to be. As public delirium over Artemis-5's impending stock offering escalates, Hanley and Thurgren, each with a spy in the other's camp, launch elaborate and progressively more dangerous cat-and-mouse games. Each of them is deeply committed to his own cause: Thurgren can't let Hanley continue unchallenged, and Hanley can't let Thurgren get in the way of his plans. The two of them spiral inexorably toward a final confrontation, a complex and explosive sting where deceit and betrayal do suspenseful battle with old-fashioned idealism and the search for truth.",

Her sister, Cassie, has always been her touchstone, the person she turns to for advice and guidance, the person whose opinion means the most to her. But ever since Cassie left for college, she\u2019s seemed different\u2014withdrawn, obsessed with studying, and she barely eats. Billie can\u2019t talk to her parents about it; they act as if nothing is wrong, refusing to see the changes in their older daughter. Now Billie has become Cassie\u2019s confidante, the only one Cassie trusts enough to tell the truth to, and Billie is suddenly thrust into an unfamiliar\u2014and disturbing\u2014role; one that drives her to make choices that will forever change the way she looks at the world.

        "Description": "Pasta with store-bought sauce, a frozen something-or-other, take-out Chinese . . . Does this sound like a typical weeknight dinner? More than likely, your everday life is hectic and you don't have time to cook, let alone cook something gourmet. But what if you could make one quick recipe at the end of a long day that was absolutely delicious and served as a complete meal? Gourmet Every Day offers what busy people like you need most--20 flavorful one-dish dinners that can be prepared in your own kitchen in minutes and more than 180 additional recipes to create your own speedy combinations.Gourmet Every Day begins with a colorful collection of 20 one-dish dinners (a month's worth of weeknight meals) designed for cooking on the run. The format is simple: On every left-hand page is a full-color photograph of a meal-in-one; on the right is the corresponding recipe, in extra-large type. Simply peruse the section, choose dinner, and cook. No page-flipping, just concise instructions with a photo to guide you. An everyday wine se-lection from Gerald Asher, Gourmet's wine editor, complements each meal. As always, Gourmet's food editors keep seasonality in mind. On a chilly night, try saffron chicken and chickpea stew, or roasted mussels with almonds and garlic. When summer harvests are at their peak, there's shrimp and corn with basil, and smoked chicken and sugar snap pea salad with mint. Ten chapters follow with hundreds of recipes to mix and match. Quick stove-top dishes, grills, soups, sandwiches and burgers, pastas and pizzas, vegetables, grains, green salads, even snacks and desserts--all can be made in 45 minutes or less and many can be made in 20 minutes! (Super-fast 20-minute recipes are marked with a icon. Many, like the Greek salad with tuna or the gazpacho with parsley pesto, require no cooking at all.) And if you are keeping an eye on your waistline, there are more than 50 leanerlighter dishes from which to choose (marked by the  F icon). Who would guess that decadent-tasting white bean, tomato, and goat cheese pizza or orecchiette with sausage and marinara sauce might just fit into your diet after all? All this, plus more than 90 exquisite photographs and many behind-the-scenes tips from Gourmet's editors, make this a quick-and-easy cookbook unlike any other.Why settle for less when you can prepare a fabulous homemade Gourmet meal in minutes? Gourmet Every Day, an everyday must for busy people, truly lives up to its name.",

In addition to analyzing the most important scholarly works, he presents topical information on recent cases and events. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)",

        "Title": "The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat",
        "Authors": "By Crawford, Steve",
        "Description": "Unarmed combat is the oldest form of fighting known to man.  Despite the development of weapons technology, a soldier - particularly a special forces soldier - can find himself in an empty-hand fight as a result of weapons failure, depleted ammunition, a need for silence, or a failed escape and evasion attempt.  To survive, he needs to be fully trained in the use of weapons that are always at his disposal, never jam, and never run out of ammunition - his hands and feet.  Properly used, they can stop an attacker dead in his tracks.In a military context, close-quarters combat is about survival:  any and all means are valid.  Surprise and speed are essential and the intention is to attack, not simply defend.  The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat provides a detailed examination of the subject, with clear descriptions supported by black-and-white photographs and line drawings showing specific techniques.  Starting with an overview of the historical development of unarmed combat, this book works through training (both physical and mental), vulnerable areas of the body, and particular techniques:  punching and kicking, blocks, chokes and headlocks, breaking holds, throws, and ground fighting.The techniques used by special forces around the world are examined here:  the lethal strikes of the Spetsnaz, locks and constrictions used by the Egyptian special forces, U.S. Army throws and holds, and elementary methods taught to Britain's Parachute Regiment.  The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat spells out the elements of hand-to-hand fighting from the soldier's point of view.",

        "Authors": "By Strathern, Paul",
        "Description": "Just a century after it had begun, philosophy entered its greatest age with the appearance of Socrates, who spent so much of his time talking about philosophy on the streets of Athens that he never got around to writing anything down. His method of aggressive questioning, called dialectic, was the forerunner of logic; he used it to cut through the twaddle of his adversaries and arrive at the truth. Rather than questioning the world, he believed, we would be better off questioning ourselves. Socrates placed philosophy on the sound basis of reason. He saw the world as not accessible to our senses, only to thought. Finally charged with impiety and the corruption of youth, he was tried and sentenced to death - and ended his life by drinking the judicial hemlock.In Socrates in 90 Minutes, Paul Strathern offers a concise, expert account of Socrates' life and ideas, and explains their influence on man's struggle to understand his existence in the world. The book also includes selections from Socrates' observations; a brief list of suggested reading for those who wish to push further; and chronologies that place Socrates within his own age and in the broader scheme of philosophy.",

        "Title": "The Japanese Today: Change and Continuity, Enlarged Edition",
        "Authors": "By Reischauer, Edwin O. and Jansen, Marius B.",
        "Description": "Japan, like the rest of the world, has undergone enormous changes in the last few years. The impact of the end of the Cold War has combined with a worldwide recession to create a fluid situation in which long-held assumptions about politics and policies no longer hold. A classic, short history of Japan, this book has been brought up-to-date by Marius Jansen, now our most distinguished interpreter of Japanese history. Jansen gives a lucid account and analysis of the events that have rocked Japan since 1990, taking the story through the election of Murayama as prime minister.About the previous edition:With the two-thousand-year history of the Japanese experience as his foundation, Edwin O. Reischauer brings us an incomparable description of Japan today in all its complexity and uniqueness, both material and spiritual. His description and analysis present us with the paradox that is present-day Japan: thoroughly international, depending for its livelihood almost entirely on foreign trade, its products coveted everywhere\u2014yet not entirely liked or trusted, still feared for its past military adventurism and for its current economic aggressiveness.Reischauer begins with the rich heritage of the island nation, identifying incidents and trends that have significantly affected Japan\u2019s modern development. Much of the geographic and historical material on Japan\u2019s earlier years is drawn from his renowned study The Japanese, but the present book deepens and broadens that earlier interpretation: our knowledge of Japan has increased enormously in the intervening decade and our attitudes have become more ambivalent, while Japan too has changed, often not so subtly.Moving to contemporary Japanese society, Reischauer explores both the constants in Japanese life and the aspects that are rapidly changing. In the section on government and politics he gives pithy descriptions of the formal workings of the various organs of government and the decision-making process, as well as the most contentious issues in Japanese life\u2014pollution, nuclear power, organized labor\u2014and the elusive matter of political style.In what will become classic statements on business management and organization, Reischauer sketches the early background of trade and commerce in Japan, contrasts the struggling prewar economy with today\u2019s assertive manufacturing, and brilliantly characterizes the remarkable postwar economic miracle of Japanese heavy industry, consumer product development, and money management. In a final section, \u201cJapan and the World,\u201d he attempts to explain to skeptical Westerners that country\u2019s growing and painful dilemma between neutrality and alignment, between trade imbalance and \u201cfair\u201d practices, and the ever-vexing issue of that embodiment of Japanese specialness, a unique and difficult language that affects personal and national behavior.",
