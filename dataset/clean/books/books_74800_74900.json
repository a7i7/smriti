When my parents were married in Arles, my Grandmother Athalie took up pen and ink and wrote down a collection of her own mother's best recipes in a little blue notebook. I have that notebook in front of me now.\"Even as a child Michel Biehn was fascinated by Provence and its traditional cuisine. In this splendid volume, he takes us on a culinary journey through the changing seasons in this enchanting region of France, revealing the unique Proven\u00e7al spirit of celebration and simplicity. Consisting largely of fresh fruits, vegetables, and the bounty of the seas cooked with olive oil and natural herbs and spices, these delicious recipes appeal to today's interest in healthy, flavorful food, tempered nonetheless with a selection of irresistible indulgences.Each easy-to-follow recipe is accompanied by a wine suggestion as well as the story of the particular dish's role in Proven\u00e7al tradition-- the tangy pumpkin soup which heralds the arrival of autumn, winter's delicious daubes, or stews, the freshly picked baby vegetables of spring, and summer's savory ratatouille and bouillabaisse.Michel Biehn collaborated closely with photographer Bernard Touillon to create the settings and recipes featured in the stunning color photographs, all of which were taken using only natural lighting in order to capture the authentic atmosphere and colors of Provence and the spirit of its cuisine. More than a cookbook, this lavishly illustrated introduction to Provence and its unique lifestyle will make an exceptional and treasured gift for cooking enthusiasts, gourmets, travelers, and anyone who loves the good things in life.",

        "Description": "This cookbook is the distillation of a life's work by a self-taught American chef who learned to cook by reading cookbooks and went on to become one of the world's most renowned chefs. O'Connell began his career with a catering business in an old farmhouse, cooking on a wood stove with an electric frying pan purchased for $1.49 at a garage sale. (The pan was used for boiling, saut\u00e9eing and deep frying for parties of up to 300 guests.) This experience sharpened his awareness of how much could be done with very little. The catering business evolved into a country restaurant and Inn which opened in 1978 in a defunct garage and which is now America's only 5 star Inn.\u00a0\u00a0Craig Claiborne raves, \"the most magnificent inn I've ever seen, in this country or Europe, where I had the most fantastic meal of my life.\"This is not a typical \"Chef's Cookbook\" filled with esoteric, egomanical, and impossibly complicated recipes which only a wizard with a staff of eighty would ever attempt to produce. Rather, the recipes assembled here make up a practiced, finely honed repertoire of elegant, simple and straight-forward dishes. Everyday ingredients are elevated to new heights through surprising combinations and seductive presentations. []A Consuming Passion[] propels the home cook into a new world of American Haute Cuisine and provides the formulas for reproducing it at home. Careful and detailed instructions, all written by the author, assure success.Tim Turner's luscious photographs capture the playful but elegant spirit of the food and introduce the reader to some of the charming local characters who provide products for the Inn's kitchen as well as taking the reader on a delightful and romantic culinary journey throughout the Virginia countryside surrounding the small town affectionately known as \"Little\" Washington and reveals an America we thought was lost forever.",

His son, born first, is perfectly healthy, but the doctor immediately recognizes that his daughter has Down syndrome. Rationalizing it as a need to protect Norah, his wife, he makes a split second decision that will alter all of their lives forever. He asks his nurse, Caroline, to take the baby away to an institution and never to reveal the secret. Instead, she disappears into another city to raise the child herself. So begins this beautifully told story that unfolds over a quarter of a century\u2014in which these two families, ignorant of each other, are yet bound by the fateful decision made that winter night long ago.A family drama, The Memory Keeper\u2019s Daughter explores every mother's silent fear: What would happen if you lost your child and she grew up without you? It is also an astonishing tale of love and how the mysterious ties that hold a family together help us survive the heartache that occurs when long-buried secrets are finally uncovered.",

Instead they installed a powerful computer, called the Oversoul, and gave it the task of governing human affairs by subtly influencing human minds. That was millions of years ago. Now the Oversoul is growing weak, breaking down. It must be returned to Earth, to the master computer called the Keeper of Earth, to be repaired. The Oversoul must have human help to make that journey.But as the Oversoul grows weaker, a great warrior has arisen, stronger, smarter perhaps, than Nafai and his allies. His name is Moozh, and he is deliberately flouting the will of the Oversoul. He has won control of an army using forbidden technology. Now he is aiming his soldiers straight at Basilica, that strong fortress above the Plains.Who will stop him? Basilica remains in turmoil. Wetchik and his sons, Nafai and Issib, Elemak and Mebbekew, are not strong enough to resist alone. Can Rasa and her allies defeat him through intrigue, or will Moozh take the city and all who are in it?And meanwhile, in their dreams, the most sensitive people of the planet Harmony hear the call of the Keeper of Earth.",

        "Description": "Since 1950, most American homes have been built with plain clamshell molding, narrow colonial molding, or no molding at all, leaving the interior architecture naked and uncelebrated. Trim Idea Book shows how to change all that and highlights a wide range of styles, from 21st-century designs, including craftsman, natural, and minimalist, to period and period-inspired motifs. The book showcases hundreds of ways homeowners can use trim to spotlight and define the interior architecture of their homes - and even to compensate for its shortcomings. Trim can help define spaces that in themselves feel too large and can add volume and dimension to rooms that are otherwise too small. Trim can frame doors and windows, enhancing their presence on walls that have daunting expanses, or hiding construction flaws. Molding and trim - of wood as well as man-made materials - are readily available at home centers as well as traditional lumberyards. Style options are endless. Ideas for walls, ceilings, doors, windows, stairways, and built-ins such as bookshelves, headboards, and fireplace surrounds are all shown.",

The British torched the Capitol, the White House, and many other public buildings, setting off an inferno that illuminated the countryside for miles and sending President James Madison scurrying out of town while his wife Dolley rescued a life-sized portrait of George Washington from the flames. The author's gripping narrative--hailed by a White House curator, a Senate historian, and the chairman of the National Geographic Society, among others--is filled with vivid details of the attack. Not confining his story to Washington, Pitch also describes the brave, resourceful defense of nearby Fort McHenry and tells how Francis Scott Key, a British hostage on a ship near the Baltimore harbor during the fort's bombardment, wrote a poem that became the national anthem.",

        "Authors": "By Weinberg, Jeshajahu and Elieli, Rina",
        "Description": "This is the inside story of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C., told by the very people who developed the museum as a place for learning, communicating, and remembering. This book conveys the dedication to truth and scholarship that is the foundation of the Holocaust Memorial Museum, and details the museum's role in presenting evidence of lives and events that must never be forgotten.When the museum opened in April 1993, Holocaust survivors saw their dream come true--their story could be told to the world. Since it opened, the museum has had to contend with unprecedented attendance records, as 5000 visitors a day continue to wait in line to see the exhibitions and experiences the architecture of this remarkable place.This is a story of a monumental achievement--from the planning and construction of the museum, theater, conference center, and library; to the design and selection of exhibits; to the participation of the first visitors. It tells of the 'visitor as victim' approach to exhibitions, of the effort to educate children, and the commitment to historical truth in the narrative representation of the Holocaust.As a remembrance for visitors to the museum and an introduction for those who have yet to visit, this beautifully illustrated book gives the reader an intimate tour of the exhibitions, and an understanding of the need for this place in our society. There, we remind ourselves of that which has been, in order to assure ourselves a future that accepts the diversity of humankind.",

        "Description": "In the course of our lives, we struggle to establish careers and relationships that we hope will infuse us with a sense of purpose. While important titles, wealth, power, and possessions may represent a life that is successful in the eyes of others, pursuit of these achievements prompts us to seek more of the same again and again. However, it is only through a fundamental understanding of faith in God that we can discover His purpose for each of us in life, and can in turn pursue a meaningful existence and achieve lasting happiness.In his authentic and profound book The Spirit of Happiness, Dr. T. Byram Karasu explores the psychological barriers that prevent so many of us from allowing faith to become an integral part of our lives and from becoming truly serene and fulfilled human beings.We all experience many difficulties and conflicts in our daily lives, meeting challenges at work and in relationships, suffering through illness, losses, and failures, feeling anxious, depressed, or simply empty and purposeless. If we view such ordeals through the wisdom of the Holy Bible, which Dr. Karasu presents to us here as the ultimate self-help book, we can learn to understand and identify with God's Holy Purpose. Psycho-spiritual exercises, including meditations and affirmations based on God's word, are placed at the end of each chapter to help focus the reader's spiritual intention and lead the way to a more joyful and rewarding existence.Beautifully written and deeply moving, The Spirit of Happiness begins where most self-help books end.",

        "Authors": "By Barone, Michael and Cohen, Richard E.",
        "Description": "\"September 11 changed everything.\" How often have we heard or thought that since that awful morning? Yet for 14 months, September 11 seemed to have changed very little in American politics; the nation's electorate still seemed split evenly between the parties, divided along cultural lines. But as the results of the 2002 elections came in, it became clear that something had indeed changed, as Republicans made down-the-line gains from the statehouses to Capitol Hill. The Republican romp is only one of the topics treated in the 2004 edition of \"the bible of American politics.\" In his introduction to this new edition, Michael Barone describes how and why the nation came to elect Republican majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate in 2002--and what it will mean for politics and governance. Barone's introduction leads off the completely redesigned Almanac of American Politics 2004, which contains all the information journalists, politicians, academics, and citizens have come to expect from the nation's leading political reference work. With insightful and colorful profiles of every governor and every member of Congress as well as updated narrative profiles filled with economic, social, historical and political background information about all 50 states and 435 House districts, The Almanac of American Politics remains the indispensable guide to the American political scene. The 2004 edition also includes a look at how redistricting will alter American politics over the course of the next decade; photographs of all 535 members of Congress and the 50 governors; and voting records on important legislation, including congressional vote ratings by National Journal and a dozen influential interest groups.More Feature of the 2004 Almanac* Updated Census data and richly detailed congressional district maps* 2002 election results for each member of Congress* 2004 election analysis* Presidential results by state and by congressional district",

        "Description": "From a National Book Award-winning and bestselling author, James Carroll's examination and explaination of why he is till a practicing catholic, set against the history of the Catholic Church in America and the sometimes glorious, sometimes discouraging actions of its leaders.Practicing Catholic is a personal history of the American Catholic Church during James Carroll\u2019s lifetime. It traces the transformation of a medieval institution suspicious of American ideas of freedom and democracy into a church that has begun to embrace basic American principles of pluralism and respect for conscience. The book tells the story of heroes (Pope John xxiii, Thomas Merton, Cardinal Richard Cushing, William Sloane Coffin), and great events (Vatican ii, the Kennedys, the end of the Cold War). Considering the new meaning of belief in a secular world, it stands against the fundamentalisms of \u201cneo-athetists\u201d as well as of born again Christians. The book shows how and why the world needs a renewed, rational, vital Catholic Church. All of this is centered in the life-long journey of its author, who embraced the priesthood in his youth, but who finds in the writing life a renewal of religious belief. For James Carroll faith is a practice-- like all practice, it aims at getting better.",
