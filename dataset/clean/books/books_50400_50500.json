If man can fulfill these obligations, then and only then can he enjoy a real relationship with the world, then and only then can he know the meaning of living.Schumacher says we need maps: a \"map of knowledge\" and a \"map of living.\" The concern of the mapmaker--in this instance, Schumacher--is to find for everything it's proper place. Things out of place tend to get lost; they become invisible and there proper places end to be filled by other things that ought not be there at all and therefore serve to mislead.A Guide for the Perplexed teaches us to be our own map makers. This constantly surprising, always stimulating book will be welcomed by a large audience, including the many new fans who believe strongly in what Schumacher has to say.",

        "Authors": "By Starks, Richard and Murcutt, Miriam",
        "Description": "November 1943.Caught in a violent storm and blown far off their intended course, five American airmen--flying the dangerous Himalayan supply route known as \"The Hump\"?7were forced to bail out just seconds before their plane ran out of fuel. To their astonishment, they found they had landed in the heart of Tibet.Miraculously, all five survived the jump. But their ordeal was just beginning.After crossing some of Tibet''s most treacherous mountains, the five airmen rode on borrowed mules into the fabled city of Lhasa. Their arrival was not a matter of choice; instead, they were escorted to Lhasa by a suspicious Tibetan government, trapped in a tightening vise between China and the West.The five were among the first Americans ever to enter the Forbidden City (two years before Heinrich Harrer, author of Seven Years in Tibet), and among the last to see it before the Chinese launched their invasion.While in Tibet, the five Americans had to confront what, to them, seemed a bizarre--even alien--people. At the same time, they had to extricate themselves from the political turmoil that even then was raging around Tibet''s right to be independent from China. To avert an international incident--and to assure their own safety--the five men were forced to leave Lhasa in a hurry. They set out, in the middle of winter, on a perilous journey across the Tibetan plateau--only to find themselves caught in a desperate race against time.Lost in Tibet is an extraordinary story of high adventure, cultural conflict, and political intrigue. It also sheds light on the remarkable Tibetan people, just at that moment when they were coming to terms with a hostile outside world.",

        "Title": "My Lobotomy: A Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Fleming, Charles and Dully, Howard",
        "Description": "In this heartfelt memoir from one of the youngest recipients of the transorbital lobotamy, Howard Dully shares the story of a painfully dysfunctional childhood, a misspent  youth, his struggle to claim the life that was taken from him, and his redemption.At twelve, Howard Dully was guilty of the same crimes as other boys his age: he was  moody and messy, rambunctious with his brothers, contrary just to prove a point,  and perpetually at odds with his parents. Yet somehow, this normal boy became one  of the youngest people on whom Dr. Walter Freeman performed his barbaric transorbital\u2014or  ice pick\u2014lobotomy.Abandoned by his family within a year of the surgery, Howard  spent his teen years in mental institutions, his twenties in jail, and his thirties  in a bottle. It wasn\u2019t until he was in his forties that Howard began to pull his  life together. But even as he began to live the \u201cnormal\u201d life he had been denied,  Howard struggled with one question: Why?There were only three people who would know the truth: Freeman, the man who performed  the procedure; Lou, his cold and demanding stepmother who brought Howard to the doctor\u2019s  attention; and his father, Rodney. Of the three, only Rodney, the man who hadn\u2019t  intervened on his son\u2019s behalf, was still living. Time was running out. Stable and  happy for the first time in decades, Howard began to search for answers.Through his research, Howard  met other lobotomy patients and their families, talked with one of Freeman\u2019s sons  about his father\u2019s controversial life\u2019s work, and confronted Rodney about his complicity.  And, in the archive where the doctor\u2019s files are stored, he finally came face to  face with the truth.Revealing what happened to a child no one\u2014not his father, not  the medical community, not the state\u2014was willing to protect, My Lobotomy exposes  a shameful chapter in the history of the treatment of mental illness. Yet, ultimately,  this is a powerful and moving chronicle of the life of one man.",

This hormonal imbalance is causing many to feel depressed, anxious, fatigued, sexless, sleepless, and ultimately ill, sometimes even terminally. What\u2019s more, Somers and twenty doctors in the field of antiaging medicine argue that the processed chemicals in foods and pharmaceuticals we ply ourselves with are actually slowly eroding our bodies and minds. So we\u2019re getting slammed twice. From estrogen dominance to deceptive thyroid problems, people are suffering, and most don\u2019t have access to the treatment they truly need to get better and thrive . . . until now. Breakthrough explores cutting-edge science and delivers smart, proactive advice on the newest treatments for breakthrough health and longevity.In addition to being a pioneer in a rapidly growing health field, Somers is a passionate, caring individual whose own life was derailed by disease and brought back to unimaginable, feel good heights that she wants you, too, to experience.",

On the day they move in, the Glover household across the street is in upheaval: convinced that his wife is having an affair, Malcolm Glover has suddenly disappeared. The reverberations of this rupture will echo through the years to come as the connection between the families deepens. But it will be the particular crises of ten-year-old Tim Glover\u2014set off by two seemingly inconsequential but ultimately indelible acts of cruelty\u2014that will erupt, full-blown, two decades later. These lives unfold against the vividly rendered backdrop of twentieth-century England at the dawn of the Thatcher era: prosperity for some and disenfranchisement for others, which will have a drastic impact on both families.Expansive and deeply felt, The Northern Clemency shows Philip Hensher to be one of our most masterly chroniclers of modern English life, and a storyteller of virtuosic gifts.",

        "Title": "The Lady Elizabeth: A Novel (Elizabeth I)",
        "Authors": "By Weir, Alison",
        "Description": "Following the tremendous success of her first novel, Innocent Traitor, which recounted  the riveting tale of the doomed Lady Jane Grey, acclaimed historian and New York  Times bestselling author Alison Weir turns her masterly storytelling skills to the  early life of young Elizabeth Tudor, who would grow up to become England\u2019s most intriguing  and powerful queen. Even at age two, Elizabeth is keenly aware that people in the  court of her father, King Henry VIII, have stopped referring to her as \u201cLady Princess\u201d  and now call her \u201cthe Lady Elizabeth.\u201d Before she is three, she learns of the tragic  fate that has befallen her mother, the enigmatic and seductive Anne Boleyn, and that  she herself has been declared illegitimate, an injustice that will haunt her.  What comes next is a succession of stepmothers, bringing with them glimpses of love,  fleeting security, tempestuous conflict, and tragedy. The death of her father puts  the teenage Elizabeth in greater peril, leaving her at the mercy of ambitious and  unscrupulous men. Like her mother two decades earlier she is imprisoned in the Tower  of London\u2014and fears she will also meet her mother\u2019s grisly end. Power-driven politics,  private scandal and public gossip, a disputed succession, and the grievous example  of her sister, \u201cBloody\u201d Queen Mary, all cement Elizabeth\u2019s resolve in matters of  statecraft and love, and set the stage for her transformation into the iconic Virgin  Queen.  Alison Weir uses her deft talents as historian and novelist to exquisitely  and suspensefully play out the conflicts between family, politics, religion, and  conscience that came to define an age. Sweeping in scope, The Lady Elizabeth is a  fascinating portrayal of a woman far ahead of her time\u2014an orphaned girl haunted by  the shadow of the axe, an independent spirit who must use her cunning and wits for  her very survival, and a future queen whose dangerous and dramatic path to the throne  shapes her future greatness.",

        "Title": "The Hour I First Believed",
        "Authors": "By Lamb, Wally",
        "Description": "Wally Lamb's two previous novels, She's Come Undone and I Know This Much Is True, struck a chord with readers. They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. One critic called Wally Lamb a \"modern-day Dostoyevsky,\" whose characters struggle not only with their respective pasts, but with a \"mocking, sadistic God\" in whom they don't believe but to whom they turn, nevertheless, in times of trouble (New York Times).In his new novel, The Hour I First Believed, Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues.While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface.As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy. His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary\u2014and American.The Hour I First Believed is a profound and heart-rending work of fiction. Wally Lamb proves himself a virtuoso storyteller, assembling a variety of voices and an ensemble of characters rich enough to evoke all of humanity.",

With great skill, he examines the very foundations of today's economic philosophy and adds a compelling analysis of the forces behind economic crisis. His goal is nothing less than preventing the seemingly endless procession of damaging boom-bust cycles, unsustainable economic bubbles, crippling credit crunches, and debilitating inflation. His direct, conscientious, and honest approach will captivate any reader and is an invaluable aid in understanding today's economy.",

        "Title": "Lincoln President-Elect: Abraham Lincoln and the Great Secession Winter 1860-1861",
        "Authors": "By Holzer, Harold",
        "Description": "One of our most eminent Lincoln scholars, winner of a Lincoln Prize for his Lincoln at Cooper Union, examines the four months between Lincoln's election and inauguration, when the president-elect made the most important decision of his coming presidency -- there would be no compromise on slavery or secession of the slaveholding states, even at the cost of civil war.Abraham Lincoln first demonstrated his determination and leadership in the Great Secession Winter -- the four months between his election in November 1860 and his inauguration in March 1861 -- when he rejected compromises urged on him by Republicans and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, that might have preserved the Union a little longer but would have enshrined slavery for generations. Though Lincoln has been criticized by many historians for failing to appreciate the severity of the secession crisis that greeted his victory, Harold Holzer shows that the presidentelect waged a shrewd and complex campaign to prevent the expansion of slavery while vainly trying to limit secession to a few Deep South states.During this most dangerous White House transition in American history, the country had two presidents: one powerless (the president-elect, possessing no constitutional authority), the other paralyzed (the incumbent who refused to act). Through limited, brilliantly timed and crafted public statements, determined private letters, tough political pressure, and personal persuasion, Lincoln guaranteed the integrity of the American political process of majority rule, sounded the death knell of slavery, and transformed not only his own image but that of the presidency, even while making inevitable the war that would be necessary to make these achievements permanent.Lincoln President-Elect is the first book to concentrate on Lincoln's public stance and private agony during these months and on the momentous consequences when he first demonstrated his determination and leadership. Holzer recasts Lincoln from an isolated prairie politician yet to establish his greatness, to a skillful shaper of men and opinion and an immovable friend of freedom at a decisive moment when allegiance to the founding credo \"all men are created equal\" might well have been sacrificed.",

        "Title": "The 10 Big Lies About America: Combating Destructive Distortions About Our Nation",
        "Authors": "By Medved, Michael",
        "Description": "\u201cIt ain\u2019t so much the things we don\u2019t know that get us into trouble,nineteenth-century humorist Josh Billings remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s the things we know that just ain\u2019t so.\u201d In this bold and brilliantly argued book, acclaimed author and talk-radio host Michael Medved zeroes in on ten of the biggest fallacies that millions of Americans believe about our country\u2014in spite of incontrovertible facts to the contrary. In The 10 Big Lies About America, Medved pinpoints the most pernicious pieces of America-bashing disinformation that pollute current debates about the economy, race, religion in politics, the Iraq war, and other contentious issues.The myths that Medved deftly debunks include:Myth: The United States is uniquely guilty for the crime of slavery and based its wealth on stolen African labor.Fact: The colonies that became the United States accounted for, at most, 3 percent of the abominable international slave trade; the persistence of slavery in America slowed economic progress; and the U.S. deserves unique credit for ending slavery.Myth: The alarming rise of big business hurts the United States and oppresses its people. Fact: Corporations played an indispensable role in building America, and corporate growth has brought progress that benefits all with cheaper goods and better jobs. Myth: The Founders intended a secular, not Christian, nation. Fact: Even after ratifying the Constitution, fully half the state governments endorsed specific Chris\u00adtian denominations. And just a day after approving the First Amendment, forbidding the establishment of religion, Congress called for a national \u201cday of public thanksgiving and prayer\u201d to acknowledge \u201cthe many signal favors of Almighty God.\u201dMyth: A war on the middle class means less comfort and opportunity for the average American. Fact: Familiar campaign rhetoric about the victimized middle class ignores the overwhelming statistical evidence that the standard of living keeps rising for every segment of the population, as well as the real-life experience of tens of millions of middle-class Americans.Each of the ten lies\u2014widely believed among elites and taught as truth in universities and public schools\u2014is a grotesque, propagandistic distortion of the historical record. For everyone who is tired of hearing America denigrated by people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, The 10 Big Lies About America supplies the ammunition necessary to fire back the next time somebody tries to recycle these baseless beliefs. Medved\u2019s witty, well-documented rebuttal is a refreshing reminder that as Americans we should feel blessed, not burdened, by our heritage.",

When your brain works right, so do you. When it\u2019s out of balance, you feel frustrated, or worse. Yet amid all the advice that bombards us daily about how to keep the rest of our body strong and healthy, we hear very little about how to keep the most complex and magnificent organ of all\u2014the human brain\u2014in top working order.Based on the most up-to-date research, as well as on Dr. Daniel Amen\u2019s more than twenty years of treating patients at the Amen Clinics, where he and his associates pioneered the use of brain imaging in clinical practice, Magnificent Mind at Any Age does exactly that. Dr. Amen shows how many of the traditional approaches to overcoming the mind-centered challenges that hold us back\u2014try harder, work longer, find the sheer willpower\u2014either do not work or may make our problems worse. The true key to satisfaction and success at any age is a healthy brain. By optimizing our brain function we can all develop these qualities of a magnificent mind enjoyed by the world\u2019s most successful and happiest people: \u2022 Increased memory and concentration\u2022 The ability to maintain warm and satisfying relationships\u2022 Undiminished sexual desire and performance\u2022 Goal-oriented perseverance\u2022 Better impulse control and mastery over potential addictions\u2022 Free-flowing creativity and the ability to relax and enjoy life\u2019s pleasuresTo achieve this, as Dr. Amen explains here in clearly accessible language, we have a range of options available, including proper diet, natural supplements and vitamins, exercise, positive thinking habits, and, if needed, medication. In addition to revealing how we can all take advantage of such strategies to enjoy the benefits of a balanced and healthy brain at every stage of our lives, Dr. Amen also pinpoints specific ways to tailor behavior, nutrition, and lifestyle to deal effectively with common mental challenges such as memory problems, anxiety and depression, attention deficit disorder, and insomnia.Whether you\u2019re in the midst of a demanding career or are looking forward to an active and richly rewarding retirement, Magnificent Mind at Any Age can give you the edge you need to live every day to your fullest potential.",

Eventually I drifted into writing about private betrayals, implicating myself and those close to me in ways I had never imagined.--From Things I Have Been Silent AboutAzar Nafisi, author of the beloved international bestseller Reading Lolita in Tehran, now gives us a stunning personal story of growing up in Iran, memories of her life lived in thrall to a powerful and complex mother, against the background of a country\u2019s political revolution. A girl\u2019s pain over family secrets; a young woman\u2019s discovery of the power of sensuality in literature; the price a family pays for freedom in a country beset by political upheaval\u2013these and other threads are woven together in this beautiful memoir, as a gifted storyteller once again transforms the way we see the world and \u201creminds us of why we read in the first place\u201d (Newsday).Nafisi\u2019s intelligent and complicated mother, disappointed in her dreams of leading an important and romantic life, created mesmerizing fictions about herself, her family, and her past. But her daughter soon learned that these narratives of triumph hid as much as they revealed. Nafisi\u2019s father escaped into narratives of another kind, enchanting his children with the classic tales like the Shahnamah, the Persian Book of Kings. When her father started seeing other women, young Azar began to keep his secrets from her mother. Nafisi\u2019s complicity in these childhood dramas ultimately led her to resist remaining silent about other personal, as well as political, cultural, and social, injustices. Reaching back in time to reflect on other generations in the Nafisi family, Things I\u2019ve Been Silent About is also a powerful historical portrait of a family that spans many periods of change leading up to the Islamic Revolution of 1978-79, which turned Azar Nafisi\u2019s beloved Iran into a religious dictatorship. Writing of her mother\u2019s historic term in Parliament, even while her father, once mayor of Tehran, was in jail, Nafisi explores the remarkable \u201ccoffee hours\u201d her mother presided over, where at first women came together to gossip, to tell fortunes, and to give silent acknowledgment of things never spoken about, and which then evolved into gatherings where men and women would meet to openly discuss the unfolding revolution.  Things I\u2019ve Been Silent About is, finally, a deeply personal reflection on women\u2019s choices, and on how Azar Nafisi found the inspiration for a different kind of life. This unforgettable portrait of a woman, a family, and a troubled homeland is a stunning book that readers will embrace, a new triumph from an author who is a modern master of the memoir.",

But when she is summoned to Toronto to help care for her dying uncle, Kumaran, a former member of the militant Tamil Tigers, Yalini is forced to see that violence is not a relic of the Sri Lankan past, but very much a part of her Western present.While Kumaran\u2019s loved ones gather around him to say goodbye, Yalini traces her family\u2019s roots\u2013and the conflicts facing them as ethnic Tamils\u2013through a series of marriages.

        "Description": "What is taste?  Is it individual or imposed on us from the outside?  Why are so many of us so intimidated when presented with the wine list at a restaurant?  In The Accidental Connoisseur, journalist Lawrence Osborne takes off on a personal voyage through a little-known world in pursuit of some answers.  Weaving together a fantastic cast of eccentrics and obsessives, industry magnates and small farmers, the author explores the way technological change, opinionated critics, consumer trends, wheelers and dealers, trade wars, and mass market tastes have made the elixir we drink today entirely different from the wine drunk by our grandparents.In his search for wine that is a true expression of the place that produced it, Osborne takes the reader from the high-tech present to the primitive past.  From a lavish lunch with wine tsar Robert Mondavi to the cellars of Marquis Piero Antinori in Florence, from the tasting rooms of Chateau Lafite to the humble vineyards of northern Lazio, Osborne winds his way through Renaissance palaces, $27 million wineries, tin shacks and garages, opulent restaurants, world-famous chais and vineyards, renowned villages and obscure landscapes, as well as the great cities which are the temples of wine consumption: New York, San Francisco, Paris, Florence, and Rome. On the way, we will be shown the vast tapestry of this much-desired, little-understood drink: who produces it and why, who consumes it, who critiques it?   Enchanting, delightful, entertaining, and, above all, down to earth, this is a wine book like no other.",

As they endure the ever escalating dangers around them-in their home as well as in the streets of Kabul-they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation. With heart-wrenching power and suspense, Hosseini shows how a woman's love for her family can move her to shocking and heroic acts of self-sacrifice, and that in the end it is love, or even the memory of love, that is often the key to survival.A stunning accomplishment,\u00a0A Thousand Splendid Suns\u00a0is a haunting, heartbreaking, compelling story of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love.",

The experience so exhausted Hardy that he never wrote a work of fiction again.Rich in symbolism, Jude the Obscure is the story of Jude Fawley and his struggle to rise from his station as a poor Wessex stonemason to that of a scholar at Christminster. It is also the story of Jude\u2019s ill-fated relationship with his cousin Sue Bridehead, and the ultimate tragedy that causes Jude\u2019s undoing and Sue\u2019s transformation. Jude the Obscure explores man\u2019s essential loneliness and remains one of Hardy\u2019s most widely read novels.",

        "Description": "Legendary auto executive Lee Iacocca has a question for every American: Where have all the leaders gone?The most widely recognized business executive of all time asks the tough questions that America's leaders must address:? What is each of us giving back to our country?? Do we truly love democracy?? Are we too fat and satisfied for our own good?? Why is America addicted to oil?? Do we really care about our children's futures?? Who will save the middle class?  A self-made man who many Americans once wished would run for president, Iacocca saved the Chrysler Corporation from financial ruin, masterminded the creation of the minivan, and oversaw the renovation of Ellis Island. Since then he has created the Iacocca Institute for leadership at Lehigh University and the Iacocca Foundation, which funds research for a cure for diabetes. Lee Iacocca believes that leaders are made in times of crisis -- such as today. He has known more leaders than almost anyone else -- among them nine U.S. presidents, many heads of state, and the CEOs of the nation's top corporations -- and is uniquely suited to share his wisdom, knowledge, and wit about the leadership of America.    Author of the gigantic number one bestsellers Iacocca: An Autobiography and Talking Straight, Lee Iacocca famously doesn't mince words and offers his no-nonsense, straight-up assessments of the American politicians most likely to run for president in 2008, including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Joe Biden, Bill Richardson, Mitt Romney, and John Edwards.  Confessing that he has \"flunked retirement,\" Iacocca calls on citizens of all ages to vote, get involved, and choose our leaders carefully. Along the way, he shares stories about the prominent people he's met and known, including the time he smoked cigars with Fidel Castro, what Bob Hope told him about how to live a long life, what Lady Sarah Ferguson said to him as they danced, why Bill Clinton woke him up in Italy, what Robert McNamara taught him about success, how Frank Sinatra sang for him personally, and whom Pope John Paul II asked him to pray for. We learn what he discussed with Warren Buffett, DaimlerChrysler CEO Dieter Zetsche, Ronald Reagan, Senator John Kerry, Congressman John Murtha, Prince Charles and Camilla, former Saudi ambassador Prince Bandar, rapper Snoop Dogg, financier Kirk Kerkorian, Ted Turner, Bob Dole, and many more.  Knowing that the times are urgent, the iconic leader shares his lessons learned and issues a call to action to summon Americans back to their roots of hard work, common sense, integrity, generosity, and optimism.Where have all the leaders gone?Lee Iacocca has the answer.",

        "Authors": "By Ortberg, John",
        "Description": "Normal? Who\u2019s Normal?Not you, that\u2019s for sure! No one you\u2019ve ever met, either. None of us are normal according to God\u2019s definition, and the closer we get to each other, the plainer that becomes. Yet for all our quirks, sins, and jagged edges, we need each other. Community is more than just a word\u2014it is one of our most fundamental requirements. So how do flawed, abnormal people such as ourselves master the forces that can drive us apart and come together in the life-changing relationships God designed us for?In Everybody\u2019s Normal Till You Get to Know Them, teacher and best-selling author John Ortberg zooms in on the things that make community tick. You\u2019ll get a thought-provoking look at God\u2019s heart, at others, and at yourself. Even better, you\u2019ll gain wisdom and tools for drawing closer to others in powerful, impactful ways. With humor, insight, and a gift for storytelling, Ortberg shows how community pays tremendous dividends in happiness, health, support, and growth. It\u2019s where all of us weird, unwieldy people encounter God\u2019s love in tangible ways and discover the transforming power of being loved, accepted, and valued just the way we are.The need for community is woven into the very fabric of our being. Nothing else can substitute for the life-giving benefits of connecting with others\u2014not even God. He won\u2019t preempt the way he himself has designed us to reflect his own intensely relational nature. But there\u2019s a hitch in our experience of community, says John Ortberg: We\u2019re all weird. Folks around us may seem normal enough, but just wait till we get to know them\u2014and they get to know us. The unhealthy, sinful ways we respond to life in a fallen world are hardly God\u2019s idea of \u201cnormal,\u201d and they can make us as unhuggable as porcupines. We face the \u201cporcupine dilemma,\u201d says Ortberg: We need each other, but how do we get close without getting hurt? How do we get past all those quills and grow together in Christ?In Everybody\u2019s Normal Till You Get to Know Them, Ortberg once again reveals his gift for sharing profound insights using a lighten-up approach. With winsome humor and a fondness for well-spun stories, he pops the myth of normalcy and hands us the keys to creating and sustaining relationships. \u201cGod\u2019s dream for community encompasses the redemption of all spheres of life,\u201d he says. Who doesn\u2019t want like to be liked, to be wanted, to have solid, satisfying friendships! Ortberg shows what such relationships are made of. He reveals the benefits of authenticity\u2014what it means to live with an \u201cunveiled face,\u201d as the Bible puts it. He encourages us to trade the stones it\u2019s so easy to cast at others for acceptance. He opens our eyes and heart to empathy, the art of reading people. And he takes us through the ins and outs of conflict, forgiveness, confrontation, inclusion, and gratitude.The principles and discussion questions in this book are down-to-earth. They\u2019re for real people living in a real world, and are intended to help us count the practical cost of relationship and then pay it\u2014because in all the rewards and struggles of community, we\u2019re investing in something beyond our comprehension. You could call it heaven. You could call it home. It\u2019s the place where all of us are headed, all of us belong, and all of us will be normal at last.",

Like some carnivorous cancer, the \"Bugs\" had overrun planet after planet . . . and they regarded any competing sentient species as only one more protein source. They couldn't be reasoned with, or even talked to, because no one had the least idea of how to communicate with a telepathic species with no recognizable language...and whose response to any communication attempt was a missile salvo. No one knew how large their civilization - if it could be called a \"civilization\"- actually was, or how it was organized, but the huge fleets they threw against their opponents suggested that it was enormous.The Grand Alliance of Humans, Orions, Ophiuchi, and Gorm, united in desperate self-defense, have been driven to the wall. Billions of their civilians have been slaughtered. Their most powerful offensive operation has ended in shattering defeat and the deaths of their most experienced and revered military commanders. The edge in technology with which they began the war is eroding out from under them and whatever they do, the Bugs just keep coming.But the warriors of the Grand Alliance know what stands behind them and they will surrender no more civilians to the oncoming juggernaut. They will die first...and they will also reactivate General Directive 18, however horrible it may be. Because when the only possible outcomes are victory or racial extermination, only one option is acceptable.The Shiva Option.",

But often it goes misdiagnosed, and kids can be prescribed medication that only worsens the condition. With her twenty-five years&#39; experience, child psychiatrist Rosalie Greenberg offers parents and professionals alike an innovative approach to help bipolar youngsters locate that elusive inner calm. Gathering stories from families on the front lines, she shows parents how best to navigate the peaks and valleys of the disorder, addresses family relationships, and guides parents in making meaningful choices about their child&#39;s education and treatment options. A masterful book that recognizes the brilliance and creativity in bipolar kids, it will give hope that every child can, with the proper interventions, lead a full, productive life.",

The authors have added many all-new entries on exotic produce and other unusual ingredients. An earlier edition of  The New Food Lover's Companion  was hailed by   Bon App\u00a9tit  magazine as \"one of the best reference books we've seen, a must for every cook's library.\" This new edition has even more to offer! Among the myriad foods and culinary subjects defined and explained are cooking tools and techniques, meat cuts, breads, pastas, international foods, cheeses, eggs and omelets, herbs and spices, fruits and vegetables, candies and desserts, wines and cocktails, and literally everything else related to good food and enjoyable dining. Handy and helpful appendices cover a wide range of food-related topics. They include suggestions for substituting recipe ingredients, high-altitude baking adjustments, a microwave oven conversion chart, recommended safe cooking temperatures for various meats and fish, a guide to reading food package labels, seasoning suggestions to enhance favorite dishes, a food additives directory, and much more.  The New Food Lover's Companion  is a reference guide--not a cookbook--but it includes hundreds of cooking tips plus an extensive bibliography of recommended cookbooks and other food-related literature. Here in one volume is an invaluable companion for cooks--and for everybody else who loves good food. More than 6,700 entries plus line art that shows retail cuts of lamb, pork, beef, and veal.",
