        "Description": "Mrs. Pargeter doesn't much like diets. She never felt any need to change her own pleasingly ample figure, but she's happy enough to accompany her slimming-obsessed friend Kim Thurrock for a few days' stay at the exclusive Brotherton Hall health spa.There's one condition, however. Mrs. Pargeter must receive a special \"allergy treatment\" featuring the choice delicacies of a cordon bleu chef and an excellent wine list. Suitably assured of rich food and drink, she relaxes and looks forward to a luxurious rest.Until ... she sees two men wheeling away a young girl's body.Never one to let a murder go unsolved, Mrs. Pargeter sets off on a dangerous trail of inquiry through the pretensions and occasional charlatanism of the health-and-fitness game. It's a trail that brings her up against many of her late husband's \"business associates\" - among them, the lugubrious private eye Truffler Mason, journalist Ellie Fenchurch, Brotherton Hall's manager \"Ankle-Deep\" Arkwright, surgical specialist \"Jack the Knife,\" and the enigmatic Stan the Stapler.But can she trust them all, or were some involved in the notorious betrayal of the late Mr. Pargeter summed up in the one ominous word \"Streatham\"?In typically unflappable style, Mrs. Pargeter rides through the investigation - from Brotherton Hall to London's King's Cross, through Cambridge University to a Dead Sea mud bath - in search of the villain. Justice will prevail. One way or another, Mrs. Pargeter will get her pound of flesh.The fourth excursion for this irrepressible widow, Mrs. Pargeter's Pound of Flesh is bound to bring even more enthusiastic fans to Simon Brett's masterly series of mysteries.",

Twenty years have passed since Courtine and Austin last met, and the invitation to Austin's home in the cathedral close of Thurchester is a welcome one. When Courtine arrives, Austin tells him a tale of deadly rivalry and murder two centuries old. The mystery captures Courtine's donnish imagination, as it is intended to do.Courtine also plans to pursue his research into another unresolved and older mystery in the labyrinthine cathedral library. If he can track down an elusive eleventh-century manuscript, he hopes to dispose of a deadly rival of his own. Doubly distracted, Courtine becomes unwittingly enmeshed in the sequence of terrible events that follows his arrival, and he becomes witness to a murder that seems never to have been committed.",

Although more than a decade has passed since the publication of Whip Hand, little time has elapsed in Sid Halley's life. Still in his mid-thirties, he remains troubled, courageous, unwilling to admit defeat to disabling injury or corruption. Now, though, Sid faces nineties dilemmas and hazards even more serious than those he once faced in horse racing, the passion that cost him his hand, and \"the only sport so dangerous that ambulances follow the athletes from start to finish\" (The Philadelphia Inquirer).\"I had this friend that everyone loved,\" Halley says, \"and I put him on trial.... I grieved for the loss of a friendship, for a man who still looked the same but was different, alien...despicable. I could much more easily have grieved for him dead.\"Having exposed an adored racing figure as a monster, Sid must testify at the man's trial. But the morning of his appearance, a tragic suicide shatters the proceedings and jars Halley's conscience. Plagued by regret and the suspicion that there's more to the death than has yet come to light, he is catapulted into days of hard, rational investigation, heart-searching torments, and the gravest of perils. Business as usual for Sid...",

We have entered an age of customer scarcity--an age in which exciting, often unorthodox companies are revolutionizing the global marketplace. In this path-cutting work, Wiersema provides new benchmarks for ranking businesses in this new economy and reveals the strategies that set winning companies apart.  After tracking 5,000 companies worldwide for over six years, Wiersema discovered that just a few hundred of these of these exert tremendous influence on the new economy. Here, he explains why traditional measures of competitive prowess no longer apply and, using new yardsticks, identifies today's 100 most influential businesses. With practical strategies for managers and investors, Wiersema then shows how to recognize and emulate these dynamic new market leaders.",

Until Charles Higham's 1.3 million-copy bestseller, much of her life was a glamorous mystery. Now, fifteen years later, major new documentary evidence, classified at the time, makes for a book far more sensational than the original bestseller. Drawing from long-suppressed archives in France, England, and the United States, Higham has uncovered the duchess's passionate affair with a top-ranking political figure, the duke's romantic involvement with a male equerry, the secret radio broadcasts the couple made to Hitler, and the blackmail plot in Paris that almost brought them - and the British royal family - to ruin.",

But then she learns something extraordinary, and how this knowledge affects Pat and Maggie in 1990s Virginia stirs up some very modern, very real danger.",

        "Description": "\"My father died when I was seven years old. I've always thought that was the most important thing anyone could know about me.\" The beloved, lost father - the Shadow Man: in this searing memoir, one of America's finest writers discovers the truth about the man whose romantic image defined her life.But who was David Gordon really? In Mary Gordon's memories of him, he was an erudite and charming man: an intellectual, a writer and publisher, a Harvard dropout and Jazz Age bohemian. But at midlife she began to question these loving memories and to go in search of the man whose presence - and absence - haunted her life. Unburying startling truths, Gordon discovers both a devoted, inventive, and loving father and a person desperate to cover up the underside of the immigrant's encounter with the American dream. As Gordon tracks her father - in the archives, in libraries, in the middle of America - she uncovers lies, despair, madness: a man who lied about many things, including his date and place of birth, his native language, his family, his education. A Jew born in the last years of the nineteenth century, he became a convert to Catholicism and to right-wing politics, a literary critic who was also a pornographer, and a vicious anti-Semite. As a realistic portrait of her father emerges, Mary Gordon reevaluates herself in the light of these painful discoveries about her heritage and past.",

        "Description": "Al Dunlap is an original: an outspoken, irascible executive with an incredible track record of injecting new life into tired companies. The business media have coined a new verb--\"to dunlap\"--when describing a fast company turnaround. In April 1994 he became CEO and chairman of Scott Paper, which had lost $277 million in 1993, was on credit watch for excessive debt, and whose stock had been comatose for seven years. In a mere nineteen months, Scott had record earnings, the stock had increased in value by $6.5 billion (over 200 percent), and Dunlap merged Scott with Kimberly-Clark in a stock swap that valued Scott at $9 billion and created the second largest consumer-products company in the United States.Mean Business combines Dunlap's colorful personal history--his working-class background, employment, friendship with such people as Sir James Goldsmith and George Soros, his views on why too many executives think of themselves as corporate royalty--and his provocative ideas on management and leadership. His specific, tested program on how to evaluate and choose a management team, get the lowest costs from suppliers, improve the balance sheet, and develop a real strategy make this an invaluable book.The controversy about corporate performance and how to achieve it is near the boiling point, as executives face the hard fact of business life: What is good or even excellent today won't be satisfactory tomorrow. Mean Business is absolutely essential for both companies in trouble as well as those at the top of their game.",

He could bolt from his office in Manhattan for an early start to a long weekend, or continue to toil over the paperwork that had been sitting on his desk for far too long. But as the network's youngest executive, Cobb saw his duty and buried his nose in a heap of spreadsheets. Moments later Richard Bentyne burst into his office and Matt Cobb knew he should have hit the highway.In the late-night talk-show wars, Richard Bentyne is a ruthless samurai whose whopping forty-five-million-dollar contract is shadowed only by the size of his ego. The network brought him on board to battle Letterman and Leno, and he has come to ask Cobb to go to Kennedy International to pick up his secret weapon - the \"mountain man.\"Clement Bates, the ultrawealthy and intensely eccentric mountain hermit, hasn't set foot on civilized soil in thirty-five years and is making his first public appearance on Bentyne's show. America, however, never gets to see Bates's debut. Television's favorite talk-show host has been canceled - forever - and Cobb's newest special project is to find the killer and protect the Network.",
