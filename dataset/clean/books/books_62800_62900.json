But Jed's life is thrown into chaos when his former mentor, the game-theory scientist Taro Mora, and a mysterious game designer named Marena Park, ask him for his opinion on a newly discovered Mayan codex - an ancient book that contains an account of a Game predicting the end of the world.For thousands of years the fate of mankind has been etched into the fabric of history, and not even the greatest advancements in modern science and technology have been able to thwart it. Now at the brink of the end of time, Marena and Taro need someone to travel back to AD 664, to learn to play the original version of the Sacrifice Game, and Jed, who has spent his whole life hungering to retrieve his lost heritage, convinces them that he should be the one to go. With the future of humanity in his hands, the scientists replicate Jed's brainwaves and send them through a \"desktop wormhole\" straight into the mind of a Mayan king. Only something goes wrong. Instead of becoming the Lord of the ancient Maya city of Ix, Jed arrives inside a Maya ballplayer named Chacal, who is seconds away from throwing himself down the temple steps as a human sacrifice. If Jed can survive the next few minutes, he might just save the world.",

The Assassins' Gate also describes the place of the war in American life: the ideological battles in Washington that led to chaos in Iraq, the ordeal of a fallen soldier 's family, and the political culture of a country too bitterly polarized to realize such a vast and morally complex undertaking. George Packer's best-selling first-person narrative combines the scope of an epic history with the depth and intimacy of a novel, creating a masterful account of America's most controversial foreign venture since Vietnam.",

His new book Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less does just that. Dealing not only with spiraling gas prices, but with the energy crisis as a whole, Gingrich shows how we can safely reap the benefits of America's own natural resources and technology in gas, oil, coal, wind, solar, biofuels and nuclear energy.Gingrich argues that the pinch Americans are feeling at the pump is not a blip in the economy but a looming crisis--affecting not only the price of gas, but the price of food, the strength of our economy, and our national security.To meet this crisis, Gingrich lays out a national strategy that will tap America's scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs, and require Congress to unlock our oil reserves and remove all the impediments and disincentives that unnecessary government regulation has put in the way of American energy independence. The energy crisis is solvable, as Newt Gingrich's plan makes clear. His handbook, Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less is sure to become the talk of the presidential campaign season.",

        "Description": "A landmark publication in the history of American letters, and a unique opportunity to celebrate the legacy of the one of the great public intellectuals of our time.  For more than a half century, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. was at the vital center of American political and cultural life. From his entrance into political leadership circles in the 1950s through his years in the Kennedy White House and up until his very last days, he was that rare thing, a master historian who enjoyed an extraordinary eyewitness vantage on history as it was being made. On intimate terms with many of the most prominent political, cultural and intellectual figures of the last fifty years, he was a man whose proximity to power never obscured his appreciation for the reality of those who have none. For that capacity for empathy and for much else, he was often called American liberalism's greatest voice.  For most of his adult life, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. dutifully recorded his experiences and opinions in journals that, until now, have never been seen. Edited by his oldest sons, they offer remarkably fresh and lucid observations on a half century of public life, and a rare and privileged view into the mind of one of America's most distinguished men of letters. Frank, revelatory, suffused with wit and humanity, these entries offer an intimate history of postwar America, from his days on Adlai Stevenson's campaign team to his years in JFK and RFK's inner circle, through to the election of George W. Bush. They contain his candid reminiscences about many of the signal events of our time - the Bay of Pigs, the devastating assassinations of the 1960s, Vietnam, Watergate, the fall of the Soviet Union, Bush v. Gore. These journals also offer an extraordinary window into the lives of the wide range of politicians, intellectuals, writers and actors who were his friends - from the Kennedys to the Clintons, from Henry Kissinger to Adlai Stevenson, from Norman Mailer to Lauren Bacall. Together they form an astonishingly vivid portrait of American politics and culture in the second half of the 20th century - one that only a man who knew everyone and missed nothing, could provide.  Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. was one of America's greatest moral and intellectual forces, and the publication of his journals is both itself an epic event in the history of American letters, and a fitting opportunity to celebrate this most remarkable American life.",

Set against this backdrop, The Day the Leader Was Killed relates the tale of a middle-class Cairene family. Rich with irony and infused with political undertones, the story is narrated alternately by the pious and mischievous family patriarch Muhtashimi Zayed, his hapless grandson Elwan, and Elwan's headstrong and beautiful fiancee Randa.\u00a0\u00a0The novel reaches its climax with the assassination of Sadat on October 6, 1981, an event around which the fictional plot is skillfully woven. The Day the Leader Was Killed brings us the essence of Mahfouz's genius and is further proof that he has, in the words of the Nobel citation, \"formed an Arabic narrative art that applies to all mankind.\"",

Following its hugely successful publication in 1740, it went on to become one of the most influential books in literary history, setting the course for the novel for the next century and beyond. Pamela reflects changing social roles in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, as a rising middle class offered women more choices and as traditional master-servant relationships underwent change.",

Nothing could save the sensitive child but her talent for words, music and drama, and an inexorable desire to be loved.  When she was twenty, her poetry would make her famous; at thirty she would be loved by readers the world over.Edna St. Vincent Millay was widely considered to be the most seductive woman of her age.  Few men could resist her, and many women also fell under her spell.  From the publication of her first poems until the scandal over Fatal Interview twenty years later, gossip about the poet's liberated lifestyle prompted speculation about who might be the real subject of her verses.Using letters, diaries and journals of the poet and her lovers that have only recently become available, Daniel Mark Epstein tells the astonishing story of the life, dedicated to art and love, that inspired the sublime lyrics of Edna St. Vincent Millay.",

Englander\u2019s wondrous and much-heralded collection of stories won the 2000 Pen/Malamud Award and was translated into more than a dozen languages. From its unforgettable opening scene in the darkness of a forgotten cemetery in Buenos Aires, The Ministry of Special Cases casts a powerful spell. In the heart of Argentina\u2019s Dirty War, Kaddish Poznan struggles with a son who won\u2019t accept him; strives for a wife who forever saves him; and spends his nights protecting the good name of a community that denies his existence--and denies a checkered history that only Kaddish holds dear. When the nightmare of the disappeared children brings the Poznan family to its knees, they are thrust into the unyielding corridors of the Ministry of Special Cases, the refuge of last resort. Nathan Englander\u2019s first novel is a timeless story of fathers and sons.  In a world turned upside down, where the past and the future, the nature of truth itself, all take shape according to a corrupt government\u2019s whims, one man--one spectacularly hopeless man--fights to overcome his history and his name, and, if for only once in his life, to put things right. Here again are all the marvelous qualities for which Englander\u2019s first book was immediately beloved: his exuberant wit and invention, his cosmic sense of the absurd, his genius for balancing joyfulness and despair. Through the devastation of a single family, Englander captures, indelibly, the grief of a nation.  The Ministry of Special Cases, like Englander\u2019s stories before it, is a celebration of our humanity, in all its weakness, and--despite that--hope.",

In this groundbreaking book, Laura and Malcolm Gauld draw on their experience as parents and as educators at Hyde -- an organization of award-winning schools and programs -- to argue persuasively that true education springs not just from seeking good grades and achievements but from reestablishing a commitment to character, attitude, and purpose. Offering a new paradigm for reconnecting education with values, the Gaulds focus attention not on the child, but on the child's primary teacher -- the parent.  After explaining how enormous a parent's impact is on how children approach education and life, the Gaulds detail the Hyde program's 10 Priorities for meeting life's challenges so that any family can embrace them. Interspersed throughout are dozens of remarkable stories of Hyde parents and students; their funny, moving, and provocative anecdotes reveal that astonishing results are possible and that all children -- and their parents -- can exceed expectations and realize their full potential.",

His daughters are grown, his wife has died, and the idea of running an avocado grove in Texas suddenly seems infinitely more appealing than the rambling house and the wholesale produce business that have sustained him so far. So a new life it is. Rudy leaves home and heads for a part of the world where he knows scarcely a soul. But he has a guide: a slender book one of his daughters has given him called Philosophy Made Simple, each chapter highlighting the ideas of a different philosopher. As he plunges into his unknown future, Rudy meets his challenges philosopher by philosopher, beginning with Plato and Aristotle and ending with Schopenhauer and Sartre. But no amount of philosophy can prepare Rudy for the surprises that emerge as he arranges for his daughter's Hindu wedding and gets to know Norma Jean - an elephant with a talent for painting who is abandoned to Rudy's care. Norma Jean's vast heart opens up Rudy's spirit and leads to his encounter with an extraordinary woman and the prospect of a new love.",

        "Description": "If baseball is America's national pastime, surely our national genius is in tinkering: taking things apart to see how they are put together and how they work. The Way Baseball Works combines these two expressions of Yankee (to say nothing of Dodger) ingenuity to break the game down into its component parts and examine it through text, charts, computer-generated illustrations, and photos.  The Way Baseball Works explores:  * The development and design of equipment, from the construction of a baseball to the evolution of the glove * The science of the game -- pitching grips and trajectories, the physics of fielding, and the reason why, as Ted Williams said, \"hitting a baseball is the hardest thing in sports\" * The geometry of a ballpark, and why baseball, virtually alone among team sports, is a different game depending upon the park in which it is played. * The game as it is played at its highest level: in the head. How managers decide when to hit-and-run and when to sacrifice, how players make the split-second decisions that spell the difference between hitting .250 and .310...the difference between victory and defeat * The organization of baseball at all levels, including introductions to the dramatis personae of a baseball game -- not just players, but grounds-keepers, umpires, scorers, and trainers, all part of the ceremony and history of this most American of games.  The Way Baseball Works, featuring an introduction and dozens of comments by ex-major leaguer and present-day broadcaster and analyst Tim McCarver, and published with the full cooperation of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, is the ultimate treasure for baseball fans.

        "Title": "Inside the Helmet: A Player's Eye View of the N.F.L.",
        "Authors": "By King, Peter",
        "Description": "To the unsophisticated eye, football is a simple game. Eleven hulking behemoths line up on one side of a football; another eleven line up across from them. When the ball is snapped, both sides erupt into a single writhing, violent mass of bodies. Then, when everyone stops moving, they line up and do it again.Just because football doesn't look neat and precise doesn't mean that it lacks order. In fact, each seemingly chaotic play is the result of analysis, planning, practice, split-second adjustments, and the executions of well-rehearsed movements. And, because every player on the field is involved in the success or failure of each play, the attention to detail in football is mind-boggling.In Inside the Helmet, Peter King, Sports Illustrated's lead pro football columnist, takes us inside the world of professional football and shows us the game only the players and coaches see. As he profiles football's best and brightest, King shows us the intricacies of each position and why attention to detail wins and loses games. He shares a week with Boomer Esiason as he prepares for a game and shows us how his endless hours of film study and pregame preparation translate into action on the field. He shows us how a one-man gang like Bruce Smith can change a game with his speed, strength, and technique and what an offense must do to contain him. He takes us inside the high-stakes game within the game played by league-leading pass receiver Hayward Jeffires and all-pro defensive back Rod Woodson as they face off against each other play after play. He also shows us how Barry Sanders, the game's best running back, finds a hole, as well as what he sees, feels, and senses as he slices through a defense.Inside the Helmet shows us what football coaches really do. We fly across the country with one of the game's best, Jimmy Johnson, as he and his staff look for talent, and watch as they work the phone on draft day. King also shows us how a head coach supervises his team as they get ready for a big game and explains why today's head coaches are more likely to act like business executives than fat guys holding a blocking sled. Finally, King takes us inside the much overlooked kicking game, and explains why all successful coaches say that \"special teams\" are what win or lose championships.Peter King's sources are impeccable, his access is unique, and his understanding and love of the game are unparalleled. Inside the Helmet is the best look yet at football, the real thinking fan's game.",
