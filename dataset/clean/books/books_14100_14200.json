Now, the New York Times bestselling SEAL commando of eight explosive thrillers must pay for his success. The price: exile inside the lethal world of Irish Republican Army terrorists -- the battle no one else will touch.  Relegated to head up a special ops organization made up of Brits, SEALS, spies, and NSA operatives, the Rogue Warrior is on the hunt for a high-tech hired army launched by two self-financed, new-generation terrorists. This murderous wing of the IRA is waging its own vicious little war -- smashing the Good Friday Peace Accord and killing a half dozen American and British CEOs. Refusing to be contained to Irish turf, their next planned assault promises to stun the world. Marcinko and his merry band are determined to stop them, but there are a few unknowns: they don't know the target, they don't know the date, and they don't know where the terror is going down.  From top-secret diplomatic tunnels beneath London to the high seas off the Azores, Detachment Bravo is a fast-paced, furious, in-your-face adventure...just what the Rogue Warrior was made for.",

If anything, his thinking was ahead of the country's.  That experience forms the heart and soul of The Journey from Here, a compelling call to action from a man no longer campaigning for office, but still running hard for the ideas and principles that will define the very essence of this nation.  From the perspective of a year on the road, listening to Americans in all circumstances and walks of life, Bradley now reflects on the issues we need to confront head on. The Journey from Here is a call to each of us to be our best, from a public servant at his best: informed, thoughtful, candid, unwavering in his quest to \"build consensus and advance our collective humanity a few inches.\"",

        "Description": "Susanna Moore's two previous novels have been met with the highest praise. My Old Sweetheart published in 1982, received both the PEN/Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award and the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction. And when The Whiteness of Bones appeared in 1989, Jonathan Yardley, writing in the Washington Post, hailed it as \"magic...magic that lures the reader with the seductions of passion and wit and then rewards him with the surprises that can only come when the home truths of human existence are disclosed through the eyes of a writer with a large and understanding heart.\" Now, with Sleeping Beauties, Moore gives us her most vividly drawn and emotionally charged novel yet.It is the story of Clio, a thirteen-year-old runaway - from an indifferent father and cruel stepmother - who shows up, \"unexpected and uninvited,\" at the Honolulu home of her eccentric aunt Emma: \"Clio hoped only that the mysterious ties of blood...would wrap their strong tendrils around her.\" Emma takes her in - and, in exchange, Clio agrees to \"talk-story\" and to learn the past.Emma is a collector of the legends, myths, and rites of their native Hawaii. Weaving together the history of the islands and the rich, convoluted legacy of their mixed white-and-Hawaiian family, Emma teaches Clio what it means to \"swim out of the currents of time,\" helping her to exchange her \"small past\" for a grand one. But as she enters adulthood, that same past begins to take on a crushing weight: \"If she could leave the islands...perhaps she'd be able to figure out just what she was meant to do with all of the secrets, all of the chants, and songs, and legends that so filled her head that she could no longer distinguish what was real from what was myth.\"An impulsive marriage to a well-known Hollywood actor finally provides Clio with a reason to leave the entanglements of island life and her family. But when her new life in California begins to reveal its own increasingly violent entanglements, Clio is forced to return home. Now she must find a way to embrace the difficulties of her past without forfeiting her future, and without denying her profound attachment to the extraordinary world that is her heritage.",

He's stepped over the line before and this case could push him over the edge.Deputy Annie Broussard can't walk away from the homicide either. She found the body. But pursuing the investigation will mean forming an uneasy alliance with Fourcade, a man she doesn't trust. It will mean subjecting herself to growing harassment from her fellow cops. And it will mean letting herself be drawn into the confidence of a suspected killer.",

This results in a variety of symptoms, such as fatigue and bloating, and, if not treated for a long period of time, can lead to a host of ailments and diseases.Purify Your Body is organized by 50 situations that lead to toxins in the body, including illness, overeating, jet lag, childbirth, unhealthy relationships, and holiday overindulgence. Based on the latest research, the book provides safe and natural preventions and antidotes that incorporate numerous natural medicine approaches, including bodywork, aromatherapy, herbs, nutrition, acupuncture and acupressure, and meditation.

But what they'll find will change the course of history. Forever.There's a tantalizing triangle at the heart of this drama: Samantha, a beautiful, ambitious field paleontologist; Jack, a renegade scholar with a checkered past that includes both Samantha and some off-the-wall evolutionary theories; and Dorn, Samantha's new lover, a ruthless, rich South African arms dealer hoping to gain respectability through scientific discovery. As Link races from the African jungles of Mali to the rain forests of Bolivia, it becomes only too clear that two's company . . . but three's the matrix for global disaster.At stake is nothing less than the final piece in the evolutionary puzzle, a prize that will confer instant immortality upon its discoverer. With the answer to this riddle comes technology so advanced that the future of the human race cannot go unchanged. But there's more to the search than meets the eye. A covert unit of the CIA is on the scene with a secret agenda of its own -- and the cold determination to accomplish its mission at any cost.It's a chase that will keep readers on the edge of their seats from the first page to the final climactic revelation: that the \"missing link\" that made the leap from ape to man may have been stranger than we'd ever imagined. Fast-paced and provocative, this is a thriller that races the heart and challenges the mind.",

Once again, his conduit to that bygone era, his messenger to that lost world, is Simon Morley, the man who actually proved himself capable of traveling back and forth in time.In From Time to Time, Rube's purpose in summoning Si back from that earlier world, where he has taken up permanent residence, is no less grand than an attempt to prevent World War I from erupting.",

        "Description": "Cara and Douglas, a young married couple in the Midwest, are on a reproductive adventure, a journey through love, physical intimacy, childbirth, abortion, and birth control. \"A body's all you have to get through life in,\" declares the impulsive, loving Cara, finding herself pregnant for a third time. Not at all sure she wants another child, she's already in love with this child, and her relationship with her unborn baby takes on the dimensions of an affair; their rapport, in the intimate space of her own body, begins to exclude her husband and her other children.Cara finds herself questioning abortion with a startling lack of bias - social, political, or religious. She must decide between disrupting the balance of her established family and her own life, and saying goodbye to a person who will never sit at her dinner table or play with her other children. Cara's spirited grappling with these problems counterpoints Douglas's compassionate analysis as they alternate between being the couple that is their marriage, and being two separate people in two separate bodies and sexes.At once a romance and a comedy of passion, Are You Mine? is an intimate map of the obstacle course of life's choices, a set of hurdles and predicaments so fraught with complication that every woman must negotiate it according to her own needs, circumstances, and desires. By the end of the book, Cara and Douglas, parents and lovers in the middle of America, have achieved an understanding that is at once amusing and troubling, but that is based above all on an affirmation of their own integrity.",

Each story is occasioned by one of the tradesarchaeologist, courier, surveyor - that, contrary to the State's expectations, liberate the narrator's imagination.More important, Klima gives us characters who inspire us, lives that are shaped by events beyond their control. With grace and elan, My Golden Trades captures the surreal atmosphere of Prague between 1983 and 1987, where a dance could be broken up by the secret police, where a traffic offense could lead to surveillance and arrest, where contraband books were the currency of the underworld.",

What he finds is both important and well-explained: inconsistency, overlap, and inattention to quality measures in medical treatment cost more and are more dangerous than most cost-cutting measures. . . . [This book] elevates the healthcare debate to a new level and deserves a wide readership.\"\u2014Library Journal\"An involving, human narrative explaining how we got to where we are today and what lies ahead.\"\u2014Mark Taylor, Philadelphia Inquirer\"Read this book. It will entertain you, challenge, and strengthen you in your quest for better accountability in health care.\"\u2014Alex R. Rodriguez, M.D., American Journal of Medical Quality\"Finally, a health-care book that doesn't wring its hands over the decline of medicine at the hands of money-grubbing corporations. . . . This is a readable account of what Millenson calls a 'quiet revolution' in health care, and his optimism makes for a refreshing change.\"\u2014Publishers Weekly\"With meticulous detail, historical accuracy, and an uncommon understanding of the clinical field, Millenson documents our struggle to reach accountability.\"\u2014Saty Satya-Murti, M.D., Journal of the American Medical Association",

        "Authors": "By Toffler, Alvin and Toffler, Heidi",
        "Description": "Are we plunging into a decade of bloody wars? Can they he prevented? In this highly original new book, Alvin and Heidi Toffler, two of the world's leading social thinkers and futurists, train their sights on a subject that has haunted humanity since history began: war and peace. Their premise is that the way we make wealth is the way we make war - that today's revolutionary changes in business are being mirrored in the world's armies and the future of war itself. What is needed, they say, is a parallel revolution in the way we make peace.War and Anti-War describes how the U.S. military went from drug-drenched defeat and demoralization in Vietnam to high performance in the Gulf - a story with lessons for many businesses today as they, too, restructure in preparation for the twenty-first century.When America is groping for new strategies, when its defense industries are in crisis, and when peacemakers are being outsmarted and outgunned around the world, this book tells us why we seem bent on violence - and what to do about it.The forms of war, the Tofflers tell us, have changed throughout history: the agrarian age gave us the hoe and the sword, the industrial age gave us mass production and mass destruction.Tomorrow, as information and knowledge become the core of advanced economies, they say, we will see the triumph of \"software over steel.\" Just as the theories of military strategist Carl von Clausewitz foreshadowed the industrialized war of the past two centuries - the bloodiest form of war ever - this book lays the basis for the \"knowledge strategies\" that will increasingly dominate military thinking from now on.The \"smart bombs\" used in the Gulf War provided only a pale hint of a not-too-distant world in which chameleon camouflage changes to match any terrain ... in which robots might make key military decisions... in which precision genetic weaponry can be programmed to attack a specific ethnic or racial group ... in which \"virtual reality\" weapons are used to confuse an enemy ... in which electronic \"ants\" penetrate business and intelligence computer systems ... and in which digital media replace diplomacy. Our politicians, military leaders, and peacemakers, the Tofflers warn, are no more prepared for changes like these than feudal swordsmen were for the arrival of the machine gun, the tank, and the airplane.New forms of war require new forms of peacemaking as well, and the Tofflers tell us of non-lethal weapons, of \"bloodless battles\" fought with infra-sound generators, of \"Peace Corporations\" that would profit by maintaining peace in an assigned region, of how the United Nations might be restructured to give citizens' groups, businesses, and religious movements a greater role in \"peace-fare.\"In War and Anti-War the Tofflers unveil a new world map and introduce such striking concepts as the \"revolt of the rich\" and the new division of world power among three great civilizations, those of the past, present, and future.If the Tofflers' previous works are any guide, War and Anti-War will be read not only in the corridors of political power but in war ministries and peace organizations around the world. It will change the way we think about the most urgent problem on our planet today.",

        "Description": "Anthony Quinn's One Man Tango is about a day of reckoning unlike any other in the rich life of the legendary actor, a day that leaves him to confront a lifetime of memories, wrestle the lingering demons of his youth, and defy the passage of his time on this earth.Here Quinn rediscovers himself - a child of the Mexican Revolution, smuggled into El Paso on a coal wagon; sculpting his father's tombstone as a young boy; studying architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright; preaching for Aimee Semple McPherson; learning his craft at the hands of Michael Chekhov, Akim Tamiroff, and the great John Barrymore.Along the way there are intimate reminiscences of some of Hollywood's brightest stars (such as Marlon Brando, Gary Cooper, Marilyn Monroe, Laurence Olivier, and Orson Welles), and reflections on the author's short- and long-term affairs with several of Hollywood's leading ladies (including Carole Lombard, Rita Hayworth, and Ingrid Bergman).And there are deliberations on the making of nearly three hundred motion pictures, spanning almost sixty years, including Quinn's defining turns in La Strada, Lawrence of Arabia, The Guns of Navarone; the performances in Viva Zapata! and Lust for Life that earned him Academy Awards; and his visionary role, immortalized on stage and screen, in Zorba the Greek.",

        "Authors": "By Kirberger, Kimberly",
        "Description": "Love is often a mystery to teenagers - sometimes painful, other times glorious, always challenging. This book will help them understand and sort out their myriad feelings and experiences. Rather than merely offering one adult's opinions or reflections on love, Kirberger deftly combines material from teens dealing with firsthand adolescent love with that from adults sensitive to the special needs of teens. She includes original letters she has received from teens, along with her responses to their questions, concerns and confusion. This blend provides a wide-ranging perspective on love and relationships. It will enable teens to gain wisdom and choose more wisely when making decisions in love and relationships. This book is designed to guide teens through the maze of love and relationships in a gentle, understanding and compassionate way. It isn't a dos-and-don'ts manual, but rather a how-it-is-in-love guidebook. Teens will come to treasure it as a wise and loving counselor and companion. On the roller-coaster ride of teen love, this is one book no teen can afford to be without.Check out the companion book, Teen Love : A Journal on Relationships, co-authored with Colin Mortensen of MTV's Real World/Hawaii.",
