        "Authors": "By Wetterhahn, Ralph",
        "Description": "As commanding and revelatory as the recent best-sellers Flags of Our Fathers and Black Hawk Down, this new volume on the Vietnam War ranges from an obscure Cambodian island in Southeast Asia to the Oval Office of the White House as it chronicles one of the most overlooked incidents and heartbreaking episodes in America's costliest foreign conflict. On May 12, 1975, barely two weeks after U.S. helicopters lifted off the roof of the American embassy in Saigon, the S.S. Mayaguez was seized by Cambodian forces. Four days later, President Gerald Ford ordered a raid to free the ship, even though American diplomacy had already successfully negotiated its release. The U.S. Marine strike force took flight. The ensuing battle, the last of the war, took fourteen hours and the lives of forty-one Americans, including three soldiers who were unwittingly left behind when the U.S. choppers flew off. Vietnam veteran Ralph Wetterhahn has spent more than five years investigating what happened that day in the Cambodian jungle: how the abandonment of the three men who guarded the flank of the vulnerable Marine position occurred; why they were left to their tragic fate; and how -- from unprecedented interviews with the Khmer Rouge captors -- they met their grisly deaths. His spellbinding account redeems to our national memory these three entirely forgotten young Marines and their brave deeds under fire.",

Written in a straightforward, easy-to-read style, World Hunger: Twelve Myths shakes many tenaciously held beliefs; but most important, it convinces readers that by standing together with the hungry we can advance not only humanitarian interests, but our own well-being.",

Bucky and Satchel get along like, well, like cats and dogs. Like a beleaguered parent, Rob constantly must thwart Bucky?s schemes and protect the unsuspecting Satchel. His pets? mischief continually disrupts his attempts to meet women. You try explaining to your date why your cat thinks he?s a gangsta rapper and your dog is filming his ?crib? for MTV. Would anyone live with humans who behaved like this?Bitingly funny with a wry sense of the absurdity of life with pets, Get Fuzzy appeals to everyone who has ever lived in a mixed-species household. Blueprint for Disaster is sure to be yet another Get Fuzzy best-seller.",

        "Description": "Three dramatic and emblematic stories intertwine in Zachary Lazar's extraordinary new novel, SWAY--the early days of the Rolling Stones, including the romantic triangle of Brian Jones, Anita Pallenberg, and Keith Richards; the life of avant-garde filmmaker Kenneth Anger; and the community of Charles Manson and his followers. Lazar illuminates an hour in American history when rapture found its roots in idolatrous figures and led to unprovoked and inexplicable violence. Connecting all the stories in this novel is Bobby Beausoleil, a beautiful California boy who appeared in an Anger film and eventually joined the Manson \"family.\" With great artistry, Lazar weaves scenes from these real lives together into a true but heightened reality, making superstars human, giving demons reality, and restoring mythic events to the scale of daily life.  \"One hypnotic tone poem.... It is not the now-historic acts of violence that make Sway so riveting, but its vivid character portraits and decadent, muzzy atmosphere, all rendered with the heightened sensory awareness associated with drugs and paranoia. The near miniaturist precision with which he describes Keith Richards's attempts to master his guitar, Brian Jones's acid trips and Anger's obsessive desire for Beausoleil bring this large-scale tableau into stunning relief.\" --Liz Brown, Time Out New York",

        "Title": "Stop Dating the Church!: Fall in Love with the Family of God (LifeChange Books)",
        "Authors": "By Harris, Joshua",
        "Description": "Putting in their hour or two on the weekend, many Christians take the rest of the week off, neglecting the church and her needs. It\u2019s not a serious relationship. Some shop around, looking for a church that suits their lifestyle. It\u2019s dating, with no assurances, no obligations. Bestselling author Joshua Harris calls Christians to stop playing the field and commit, just as Christ is committed to us, His bride. In his new book, Harris explores the ramifications of Ephesians 5:25\u201332, which proclaims the intensity and the breadth of Jesus Christ\u2019s love for His church. God has designed us to build our lives around a local church; we cannot be indifferent or uninvolved. Rather, we must be in love with and committed to God\u2019s plan and purpose through the church. Are you dating the church, or are you committed?Are You Dating the Church? We are a generation of consumers, independent and critical. We attend church, but we don't want to settle down and truly invest ourselves. We're not into commitment \u2014 we only want to date the church. Is this what God wants for us? Stop Dating the Church reminds us that faith was never meant to be a solo pursuit. The church is the place God grows us, encourages us, and uses us best. Loving Jesus Christ involves a passionate commitment to His church \u2014 around the world and down the street. We can't be apathetic. It's time to fall in love with the family of God.Story Behind the BookLike all my books, this one is very closely tied to my own journey. I\u2019ve been a church-dater. And I\u2019ve learned just how good it is to get serious about the church. I want to see my generation get a hold of God\u2019s purpose and plan for the local church, too. The same month this book is released I\u2019ll become the senior pastor of my church. This awesome responsibility is being passed on to me by my mentor, C. J. Mahaney, a pastor who has faithfully served for over 26 years. So this book is marking a very important transition in my life. The church isn\u2019t some other generation\u2019s responsibility\u2014it isn\u2019t somebody else\u2019s business. I have to take responsibility. I have to be passionate and committed to it. Through the pages of this book, I\u2019m calling my generation to do the same.",

Within that short time, guests at the ranch reconnect with the natural world and their place in it as living, breathing, moving creatures.   In his role as fitness director of the Life Enhancement Program at Canyon Ranch, physical therapist Randy Raugh helps guests of all ages\u2014and with all ranges of fitness levels\u2014understand how movement and activity will not only enrich their lives but will also protect them from disease, obesity, and the negative aspects of aging. As children, our bodies are primed to move\u2014every ligament, tendon, and muscle is supple and receptive to even the most sudden movements. As we age, however, our movements become more careful due to pain or fear of injury. According to Randy Raugh, it doesn't have to be this way. The latest research suggests that it's not our bodies that compel us to slow down or stop enjoying what we used to do, but it's our conscious connection to our bodies that diminishes. And that's a big part of what makes us \"feel old\"\u2014when we don't have to at all.   In Prime for Life, Randy Raugh offers the revolutionary approach he uses with his patients at Canyon Ranch to help them achieve long, active lives. By focusing on maintaining healthy joints and providing specific strategies for doing so, Raugh shows you how to: -Prevent injuries and heal physical damage accumulated over a lifetime -Achieve better results from exercise while eliminating joint and muscle pain -Learn how to talk to doctors about surgeries and detect common misdiagnoses-Discover how to create a simple fitness plan that fits into your daily routine -Find out the truth behind common myths, such as \"surgery is your only option\"   Based on cutting-edge research, more than two decades of hands-on experience, and the stories of real people, Prime for Life provides the innovative exercise strategies, tips, and tools you need to build and maintain a strong, pain-free, youthful body.",

Meanwhile, two surfer cops known as Flotsam and Jetsam keep bumping into an odd, suspicious duo--a smooth-talking player in dreads and a crazy-eyed, tattooed biker.  No one suspects that all three dubious characters might be involved in something bigger, more high-tech, and much more illegal.  After a dizzying series of twists, turns, and chases, the cops will find they've stumbled upon a complex web of crime where even the criminals can't be sure who's conning whom.  Wambaugh once again masterfully gets inside the hearts and minds of the cops whose jobs have them constantly on the brink of danger.

In modern Jerusalem, within the vigilant confines of the ultra-orthodox world of the Haredim, she is bound by the strictest letter of ancient law.At seventeen, Dina enters an arranged marriage to a loving, generous man. But restless yearnings - for knowledge, for romance, for excitement - drive her into a dangerous flirtation. When the insular community learns of her transgression, Dina is subjected to an ordeal. Like the Biblically ordained ritual for the wife suspected of adultery, the Sotah, this will either destroy her or vindicate her completely. Forced into exile in New York, Dina is appalled by the shallowness of American life. Yet it is here that she must fashion her own traditions and find the courage to return to Jerusalem to reclaim her husband, her family and her life. Ninety three weeks on the best seller lists.",

        "Description": "From Reliable Sources is a lively introduction to historical methodology, an overview of the techniques historians must master in order to reconstruct the past. Its focus on the basics of source criticism, rather than on how to find references or on the process of writing, makes it an invaluable guide for all students of history and for anyone who must extract meaning from written and unwritten sources.Martha Howell and Walter Prevenier explore the methods employed by historians to establish the reliability of materials; how they choose, authenticate, decode, compare, and, finally, interpret those sources. Illustrating their discussion with examples from the distant past as well as more contemporary events, they pay particular attention to recent information media, such as television, film, and videotape.The authors do not subscribe to the positivist belief that the historian can attain objective and total knowledge of the past. Instead, they argue that each generation of historians develops its own perspective, and that our understanding of the past is constantly reshaped by the historian and the world he or she inhabits.A substantially revised and updated edition of Prevenier's Uit goede bron, originally published in Belgium and now in its seventh edition, From Reliable Sources also provides a survey of western historiography and an extensive research bibliography.",

Egypt has undergone a revolution and, on a more personal level, his beloved wife and his trusted henchman, who conspired to betray him to the police, are now married to each other and are keeping his six-year-old daughter from him. But in the most bitter betrayal, his mentor, Rauf Ilwan, once a firebrand revolutionary who convinced Said that stealing from the rich in a unjust society is an act of justice, is now himself a rich man, a respected newspaper editor who wants nothing to do with the disgraced Said. As Said's wild attempts to achieve his idea of justice badly misfire, he becomes a hunted man so driven by hatred that he can only recognize too late his last chance at redemption.",

        "Authors": "By Bernhardt, Annette (EDT), Boushey, Heather (EDT), Dresser, Laura (EDT), and Tilly, Chris (EDT)",
        "Description": "Across the United States, increasing numbers of employers are breaking, bending, or evading long-established laws and standards designed to protect workers, from the minimum wage to job safety standards to the right to organize. This \"gloves-off economy,\" no longer confined to a marginal set of sweatshops and fly-by-night small businesses, is sending shock waves into every corner of the low-wage labor market. In the process, employers who play by the rules are under growing pressure to follow suit, intensifying the search for low-cost business strategies across a wide range of industries and ratcheting up into ever higher reaches of the labor market. Although other books have touched on pieces of this problem, The Gloves-off Economy is the first to provide a comprehensive, integrated analysis\u2014and quite a disturbing one.This book examines a range of gloves-off practices, the workers who are affected by them, and strategies for enforcing workplace standards. The editors, four respected labor scholars, have brought together economists, sociologists, labor attorneys, union strategists, and other experts to offer varying perspectives on both the problem and the creative solutions currently being explored in a wide range of communities and industries. Annette Bernhardt, Heather Boushey, Laura Dresser, and Chris Tilly and the volume's other authors combine rigorous analysis with a stirring call to renew worker protections in the twenty-first century.",

Covey demonstrates that the answer to these and other dilemmas is principle-centered leadership, a long-term, inside-out approach to developing people and organizations. The key to dealing with the challenges that face us today is to develop a principle-centered core within both ourselves and our organizations. Dr. Covey offers insights and guidelines that can help you apply these principles both at work and at home\u2014leading not just to a new understanding of how to increase quality and productivity, but also to a new appreciation of the importance of building personal and professional relationships.
