        "Description": "Powerful lessons on how to build and sustain your own \"killer brand\"Creating and sustaining a good brand is the most complex and perilous task any business will ever face, yet nothing is as misunderstood. Under the direction of marketing wizard David D\u2019Alessandro, John Hancock transformed itself from a sleepy old life insurer into a leading financial services giant, with a sustained 20% annual rate of growth.

        "Title": "While They're at War: The True Story of American Families on the Homefront",
        "Authors": "By Henderson, Kristin",
        "Description": "Kristin Henderson is a journalist married to a military chaplain who has served in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In While They're at War, she draws upon the trust she's earned from military families and her unique access to military staff to give us a \"powerful, revealing, and sometimes painful . . . look behind the scenes\" (Booklist) at the modern military's untold story.We first meet Marissa Bootes and Beth Pratt, new Army wives undergoing intense indoctrination on Fort Bragg, North Carolina, while their husbands are fighting in Iraq. Their stories unfold to reveal often hidden aspects of life on the homefront. Through gripping storytelling, we see families battling the overwhelming effects of isolation and anticipatory grief, the strongly enforced codes concerning infidelity, their feelings of alienation both from military staff and from nonmilitary citizens, and the harrowing impact of e-mail/cellphone/CNN culture. Moving scenes bring to life the special struggles of children and those who teach and care for them, as well as the toll that combat exposure takes on families, especially if it erupts into homecoming violence. Finally, Henderson reveals the life-changing solidarity experienced in an informal support group like Fort Bragg's Hooah Wives.While They're at War is an indelible portrait, too, of virtually invisible figures such as homefront fathers raising teenagers alone. We meet the chaplains, social workers, and psychiatrists dedicated to helping military families cope. And, through Henderson's brilliant reporting from Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Ward 57, we are given a searing view of the wounded and their families confronting changed lives.\"In a country of nearly three hundred million people,\" Henderson writes, \"only two and half million serve in the active duty armed forces. . . Yet in our American democracy, the warriors themselves don't get to decide when [sacrifices] are to be made. Civilians make that decision. It's up to our civilian Congress to declare war. . . and it's up to the civilians who elect those leaders to pay attention, to make sure that the cause of the hour is worth the sacrifices being made on their behalf.\" While They're at War is moving and necessary testimony for all Americans, from the military families who make possible America's way of war and way of life. Kristin Henderson has written frequently on military issues; this book had its origins in two cover stories for the Washington Post Magazine. She is also the author of Driving by Moonlight, an account of her experience during her husband's deployment to Afghanistan. A practicing Quaker, she is married to a Navy chaplain serving with the Marines and is active in the Marine Corps's Key Volunteer family readiness program.",

        "Title": "The Century of Warfare: Worldwide Conflict from 1900 to the Present Day",
        "Authors": "By Messenger, Charles",
        "Description": "Many of the conflicts of today have their roots deeply embedded in the past and are merely continuations of old grievances. Former Yugoslavia is but one example. This book gives an overview of warfare in the 20th century in all its forms, from conventional wars to guerilla warfare and terrorism. It describes the causes of wars, their course, and how peace was made. It shows, too, that sometimes the peacemakers merely create embryos for further conflict. Indeed, making lasting peace is often more difficult than deciding to go to war.The Century of Warfare also traces the awesome developments in weapons technology. From the breech-loading artillery of 1914 and the development of tanks and mortars, through rocket systems and submarines, to the devastating effects of strategic aircraft bombing and chemical and nuclear warfare, this book examines how weapons technology heralded a new and increasingly lethal era of conflict.",

Driven with the radio and the cell phone switched off.D. Exercised.E. Looked in the mirror and had a kind thought about your body.The answers to these questions most likely reveal the biggest challenge most of us face in today's hectic world. How do we do it all? We all want to eat right, work out regularly, and be able to relax and find peace at the end of the day. But it just seems that life gets in the way. Well now it doesn't have to.Mariel Hemingway's Healthy Living from the Inside Out is a revolutionary individualized program that teaches us how looking and feeling great are just a few simple choices away. No more bossy diets or impossible exercise routines. Instead, Mariel divides healthy living into four foundational areas where we can isolate the issues we all face and start making the best decisions for our life.Food: What we eat and drink affects every part of our lives, from energy level to body shape. By making us conscious about our everyday choices, we learn to use food in a positive way to boost the body and mind and correct imbalances of weight, mood, and energy. Mariel provides some of her favorite recipes to help us integrate a flavorful yet super nutritious diet into our regular lives.Exercise: Exercise is not just to stay in shape but to stay connected to ourselves. By putting the emphasis on quality not quantity, we learn to nurture ourselves, stay grounded, and transform our mental, emotional, and physical states a little bit each day. We'll end up looking and feeling better than ever.Silence: In our super noisy world, bringing quiet reflection into our lives slows down the rush, helps us learn the empowering skill of observation, and ultimately can guide us into healthier habits and behaviors.Home: Too often the home in which we live echoes the clutter and chaos of the outside world. Learn how to make home a place where we can rest, recharge, and refocus\u2014a haven for the balanced life we (and our families) seek.Encouraging us to listen to ourselves and do things differently, Mariel presents a unique 30-day program for discovering real beauty, renewed energy, and a radiant life. We can all look amazing and feel fantastic from head to toe. The results are immediate and will last a lifetime.",

When John Rain decides to get out of the business, his hand is forced by rogue CIA operative Jim Hilger. Hilger kidnaps Dox, Rain's trusted partner and closest friend, and offers Rain a choice: carry out a final assignment, or bear the responsibility for Dox's murder.  For a professional like John Rain, the choice ought to be easy: Do the job-a series of three hits-then walk away. But how does Rain know Jim Hilger won't kill Dox anyway, once the assignment is complete? How does he know that each of the hits isn't simultaneously a setup for Rain himself? And what will he do when he finds out that among the targets of this lethal game of extortion is someone else Rain cares about deeply?  From the urban canyons of Silicon Valley and New York to the lush forests of Bali, the boulevards of Paris, and the old killing fields of Vietnam, Rain must grapple with his age, his enemies, and most of all, his conscience in a battle that not even Rain-\"the stuff great characters are made of\" (Entertainment Weekly)-can hope to survive intact.",

        "Description": "Goodnight, Irene is the debut novel in an exciting new mystery series featuring Irene Kelly - reporter, intrepid amateur sleuth, and woman of today - who tracks a murderer obsessed with keeping the past from interfering with the future.In Las Piernas, California, a beach community off the coast of Los Angeles, veteran reporter O'Connor is blown to bits by a bomb; his son is buried alive in the sand; and his best friend and former colleague, Irene Kelly, is nearly killed when a stream of bullets whizzes through the window of her home. Unwilling to be the next victim in a frightening series of events, and determined to discover who murdered O'Connor, Irene takes it upon herself to track down the killer.She begins investigating by digging through O'Connor's files and deciphering his highly secretive, coded notes. Irene soon discovers that her friend was on the verge of solving a thirty-five-year-old mystery involving a pregnant woman who was brutally murdered and mutilated beyond recognition. And, this old murder mystery is somehow connected with a current political cover-up concocted by a group of local politicians involved in a greedy - and deadly - money-laundering scheme.Irene follows a lead that takes her from her California beach community to a desert Arizona town and back, determined to find out who silenced O'Connor before he could reveal the connection between the old murder mystery and the current money-laundering scheme. Ignoring deadly threats, Irene expertly gathers clues, and narrows down a long list of unlikely suspects. There's a money-hungry-politician with more to lose than the local race if the truth is revealed; a high society babe who will do anything to protect her \"impeccable\" reputation; a manipulative gigolo whose bedside secrets prove lethal; a high-ranking bank official who conveniently disappears when Irene starts nosing around; and many other memorable characters, all of whom had a personal motive for wanting O'Connor dead.To add to the tension, Irene finds herself working closely with a man from her past, handsome police detective Frank Harriman. Love is what neither expects, but it hits them both - and hard, complicating matters as they try to protect each other from someone so desperate to keep secrets, past and present, hidden that he will eliminate anyone who comes too close to the truth.",

Now this widely respected award-winning journalist lets us in on what she's seen \"inside the box\" as she steps outside for a reality check. She tells how television journalism has changed over the years, for better and for worse, and explores the critical state of TV news today. Her accounts of the political and cultural upheavals she covered also make this a social history of our time.When she first began in the industry, newspaper editors bluntly told her, \"We don't hire girls,\" but Lynn persevered, both covering and experiencing the emergence of modern feminism. All that despite being fired from her first TV job! She also addresses the heartbreak of her husband's death followed by her own battle with colon cancer. Lynn Sherr opens up about those painful times with an honesty that will touch and inspire readers. Her personal accounts\u2014growing up in Philadelphia, where her father was a pioneering professional basketball player; suddenly becoming a stepmom; slipping off to commune with giraffes\u2014all underscore her insistence on always keeping one foot outside the box.",

The new Third Edition expands on that success with a completely revised and updated text, more than 100 new color photos and diagrams and 16 additional pages that cover such! new astronomical pursuits as computerized telescopes, reviews of new telescope designs and accessories, and astronomy on the Internet.     All charts, tables and diagrams have been updated and, in some cases, redesigned for easier use. Improved spacecraft measurements of the distances to the stars (recently released by the European Space Agency) are included in the charts, along with additional observing tips for stargazers using binoculars and telescopes. An expanded chapter on Astrophotography lists the best modern films and cameras for skyshooting.    The            new NightWatch is faithful to the \"ultra-simplified, no jargon\" philosophy of the original, and at the same time, offers substantially more practical information for the novice and intermediate-level amateur astronomer. The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada called the first edition \"the best of its kind\"- the new Third Edition is better still. It is still an abundantly illustrated, wide-sized volume designed for easy reference during many starlit nights.",

Since babies can't articulate what ails them, in most cases all a parent has to go on is the symptom that the child exhibits.The American Academy of Pediatrics Guide to Your Child's Symptoms has been prepared by a team of the country's best pediatricians to enable a parent to quickly identify a symptom, learn its possible cause, and determine how best to proceed, whether it's taking action at home or calling the pediatrician immediately. The symptoms are listed alphabetically, and the text and illustrations that accompany each one are arranged in easy-to-follow charts. Unlike most child-care and parenting books, which are dense and text-heavy, this book lets a parent quickly assess the problem and decide what needs to be done for the child. The first of the book covers the 100 or so most common symptoms in A-Z format. The second part is an illustrated first-aid manual.The American Academy of Pediatrics is the most respected authority on child health in America, and the Guide to Your Child's Symptoms is an essential family reference that belongs in every household.",

        "Authors": "By Hardy, Thomas and Wood, James (INT)",
        "Description": "Etched against the background of a dying rural society, Tess of the d'Urbervilles was Thomas Hardy's 'bestseller,' and Tess Durbeyfield remains his most striking and tragic heroine. Of all the characters he created, she meant the most to him. Hopelessly torn between two men\u2014Alec d'Urberville, a wealthy, dissolute young man who seduces her in a lonely wood, and Angel Clare, her provincial, moralistic, and unforgiving husband\u2014Tess escapes from her vise of passion through a horrible, desperate act. 'Like the greatest characters in literature, Tess lives beyond the final pages of the book as a permanent citizen of the imagination,' said Irving Howe. 'In Tess he stakes everything on his sensuous apprehension of a young woman's life, a girl who is at once a simple milkmaid and an archetype of feminine strength. . . . Tess is that rare creature in literature: goodness made interesting.' Now Tess of the d'Urbervilles has been brought to television in a magnificent new co-production from A&E Network and London Weekend Television. Justine Waddell (Anna Karenina) stars as the tragic heroine, Tess; Oliver Milburn (Chandler & Co.) is Angel Clare; and Jason Flemyng is Alec d'Urberville. The cast also includes John McEnery (Black Beauty) as Jack Durbeyfield and Lesley Dunlop (The Elephant Man) as Joan Durbeyfield. Tess of the d'Urbervilles is directed by Ian Sharp and produced by Sarah Wilson, with a screenplay by Ted Whitehead; it was filmed in Hardy country, the beautiful English countryside in Dorset where Thomas Hardy set his novels.",

        "Title": "The Dinner Club: How the Masters of the Internet Universe Rode the Rise and Fall of the Greatest Boom in History",
        "Authors": "By Henry, Shannon",
        "Description": "Since 1997, on the second Monday of each month, twenty-six of the most powerful men in business, the Vanderbilts and Morgans of their time, would gather to eat dinner, hear investment pitches, and take one of the few breaks they got all month with the handful of people on earth they saw as their peers. When Washington Post reporter Shannon Henry heard about these meetings, she knew that the story of the dinners and the tales told at them would provide a fascinating portrait of the greatest business boom in the history of the world. What went on in these four-star restaurants and private dining clubs is the inside story of the 1990s...the unimaginable growth of the economy, and in hindsight, its all-too-predictable fall. Henry, widely labeled the \"dot-com diva,\" was the only reporter who had ever been allowed continued access to this intimate and influential group, which included America Online co-founders Steve Case and Jim Kimsey, NASDAQ vice chairman Al Berkeley, WorldCom CEO John Sidgmore, chief executive of MicroStrategy Michael Saylor, Virginia governor and former tech investor Mark Warner, and AOL executive and Washington Wizards co-owner Ted Leonsis. In The Dinner Club, Henry brings readers right to the dinner table, providing an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at these stories of ego, greed, dreams realized, dreams dashed, and the handful who continue to thrive.  From bankrupt companies to blockbuster surprise deals, Henry paints a ruthless, charismatic, and at times humorous portrait of the '90's boom. At one point the mercurial nature of the group and its members' concern about their reputations caused them to un-invite Henry to the meetings. But in the end, she was allowed to return and to chronicle the rise and fall of many of their companies. And now, with so many of these companies in disarray, Henry gives extraordinary insight into what these men were thinking and saying. They didn't think failure could happen to them, because they thought that they were different. But it did. The Dinner Club is not only the inside story of this historic time, but also a glimpse into the future of America, as the members of the club created a legacy that will forever affect us all.",

And on the third finger of her left hand has been placed a silver ring.Eve is catapulted back to a case nine years earlier, when a man whom the media tagged \"The Groom\" put the city on edge with a killing spree that took the lives of four women in fifteen days. Eve and her partner Feeney, her friend and mentor, couldn't stop him before he disappeared, only to resurface in other parts of the world to kill and kill again. But now The Groom seems to have come back to where he started.When it turns out that The Groom's most recent victim was employed by Eve's billionaire husband, Roarke, she brings him onto the case. A move that proves fitting when it becomes chillingly clear that the killer has made it personal. The corpse was washed in products from a store Roarke owns and laid out on a sheet his company manufactures. With The Groom's monstrous return, Eve is determined to finish him once and for all. Familiar with his methods, she knows that he has already grabbed his next victim.But his sights are set on the biggest challenge of his illustrious career - an abduction that will test his skills and that promises to give him satisfaction as he's never known.

But he discovers an easier way. One of the undead tells the lord about the Seventh Gate, the magical chamber used by the Sartan to sunder the world. The Seventh Gate still exists and whoever enters it can either create worlds - or destroy them.Only one person knows the location of this gate, although he doesn't know he knows it. That person is Haplo.Xar sends a Patryn assassin to kill Haplo and bring back his corpse. The lord plans to use his necromancy to bring Haplo back to life and turn him into a mindless slave who will reveal the location of the Gate. Xar is certain of success, for the assassin is someone from Haplos past, someone whom Haplo trusts with his life.Another assssin is also after Haplo. Hugh the Hand has been hired by the Kenkari to kill the Patryn, and the Brotherhood has provided an ancient Sartan weapon - the Accursed Blade - to help him in his task.Wounded and weakened, Haplo nearly falls victim to his killers. But when the Accursed Blade runs amok, all of them, including a terrified and extremely reluctant Alfred, find themselves fighting for their lives in the most dreaded place of all - the deadly prison maze called the Labyrinth. Betrayed by the one he loves, Haplo is imprisoned by his own people, forced to watch helplessly as an army of evil prepares to march on the Labyrinth, dooming all inside to death.",

In Paraguay a smuggler is killed in a hit-and-run. And then an elderly German businessman puts a gun in his mouth in his luxurious South American mansion. Joseph Volkmann, a member of an elite European security force, finds himself drawn into the mystery of the brutal deaths, investigating a link between the seemingly random cases that cost the journalist who connected them his life.For Volkmann a painful journey lies ahead, leading him from barren Mexican ranches to Italian ports and abandoned German monestaries, a journey that will force him to confront his own ghosts and a people he has long mistrusted. At first Volkmann has little to go on-only an inconclusive taped conversation and the charred remains of an old, torn black-and-white photograph that may hold the key to a momentous, horrific plan promising to turn the clock of European history back half a century. What makes this plan all the more terrifying is that it may reflect actual events unfolding today.Heralded by critics and fans as the next Robert Ludlum or Frederick Forsyth, Glenn Meade has done it again with Brandenburg-a sizzling read, packed with action, great characters, and an engaging story.",

        "Description": "CIA agent John Wells returns, in a novel that reaches beyond today's headlines to foretell dangers yet to come, from the author of The Faithful Spy- \"one of the best spy stories ever told\" (The Wall Street Journal).  Alex Berenson's 2006 debut was one of the most acclaimed suspense novels of the year, \"the best spy thriller in a long, long while\" (The Kansas City Star). The Ghost War proves that he is no longer a brilliant newcomer but a master of the art.  In The Faithful Spy, John Wells became the only American CIA agent ever to penetrate al-Qaeda, but his handlers became distrustful of him, and he of them. He had to stop a devastating terrorist attack nearly alone.  Now Wells is back in Washington. His wounds have healed, but his mind is far from clear. He is restless, uneasy in his skin, and careless with his safety. When the CIA finds evidence of a surge in Taliban activity, backed by an unknown foreign power, it takes little to convince Wells to return to Afghanistan to investigate. But what he discovers there is far from what he expected.  A deadly power play in China, a mission to North Korea gone terribly wrong, an Iran determined to go nuclear, a mole within the ranks of the CIA who is about to light a fuse, the consequences of which he cannot possibly understand-the world is hurtling toward confrontation. And, this time, there may be nothing John Wells can do to stop it. Real-world threats, authentic details, a scenario as dramatic as it is plausible-The Ghost War is another \"timely reminder of the extremely precarious way we live now\" (The Washington Post).",

        "Description": "The struggles and perils of battle pervade these letters, as do the hopes, fears, everyday concerns, and raw emotions of the warriors who wrote them. Presented in this handsomely illustrated volume are authentic glimpses into history during more than two centuries of warfare. Both famous historical figures and ordinary soldiers are represented.  Readers will find a battlefield letter from Napoleon to his beloved Josephine, written in 1796, before he reached his height of fame and power. By contrast, Edgar Clark was an ordinary soldier in the Union Army during the Civil War, but his letter to his family after engaging in a fierce battle gives as vivid a description of war as any to be found in official history books. Letters from the front in World War I include one from future president Harry Truman to his wife Bess, and another from the English poet Wilfred Owen to his mother. Each of this book's chapters focuses on a specific era, including the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, the Texas Revolution, the Mexican War, the American Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, and various conflicts of the late twentieth century. This memorable collection is enhanced with full-color illustrations, historic photos, maps, and photocopies of several dramatic letters.",

In August of 1863, Tomo, who is eleven years old, runs off to the Civil War and dies in his first battle. Gob grows up in a profound state of grief, and by the time he's an adult studying to be a doctor in New York City, he has begun to make real a dream to build a machine that might bring Tomo - indeed, all the war dead - back to life.As Gob's obsessions deepen, we are taken from the battlefields at Chickamauga Creek to the society balls of New York, from innocent childhoods in Homer, Ohio, to the building of the Brooklyn Bridge; and as the machine grows, so does the amazing cast of real and imagined characters: Walt Whitman, ministering lovingly to the Civil War wounded; Mrs. Woodhull and her sister Tennessee, doing business on Wall Street and riding churning tides of scandal; Gob's friend Will Fie, a war veteran who builds a house from glass images of suffering and death; Maci Trufant, Victoria Woodhull's protege and Gob's great love; and even unnatural Pickie Beecher, a child who seems to float sinisterly between the living and the dead. These disparate lives come together in support of Gob's endeavor, but the abolition of death and the success of his machine may come at a price more hideous and awful than any of them can know.",

        "Title": "The Touch",
        "Authors": "By McCullough, Colleen",
        "Description": "Not since The Thorn Birds has Colleen McCullough written a novel of such broad appeal about a family and the Australian experience as The Touch.  At its center is Alexander Kinross, remembered as a young man in his native Scotland only as a shiftless boilermaker's apprentice and a godless rebel. But when, years later, he writes from Australia to summon his bride, his Scottish relatives quickly realize that he has made a fortune in the gold fields and is now a man to be reckoned with.  Arriving in Sydney after a difficult voyage, the sixteen-year-old Elizabeth Drummond meets her husband-to-be and discovers to her dismay that he frightens and repels her. Offered no choice, she marries him and is whisked at once across a wild, uninhabited countryside to Alexander's own town, named Kinross after himself. In the crags above it lies the world's richest gold mine.   Isolated in Alexander's great house, with no company save Chinese servants, Elizabeth finds that the intimacies of marriage do not prompt her husband to enlighten her about his past life -- or even his present one. She has no idea that he still has a mistress, the  sensual, tough, outspoken Ruby Costevan, whom Alexander has established in his town, nor that he has also made Ruby a partner in his company, rapidly expanding its interests far beyond gold. Ruby has a son, Lee, whose father is the head of the beleaguered Chinese community; the boy becomes dear to Alexander, who fosters his education as a gentleman.  Captured by the very different natures of Elizabeth and Ruby, Alexander resolves to have both of them. Why should he not? He has the fabled \"Midas Touch\" -- a combination of curiosity, boldness and intelligence that he applies to every situation, and which fails him only when it comes to these two women.  Although Ruby loves Alexander desperately, Elizabeth does not. Elizabeth bears him two daughters: the brilliant Nell, so much like her father; and the beautiful, haunting Anna, who is to present her father with a torment out of which for once he cannot buy his way. Thwarted in his desire for a son, Alexander turns to Ruby's boy as a possible heir to his empire, unaware that by keeping Lee with him, he is courting disaster.  The stories of the lives of Alexander, Elizabeth and Ruby are intermingled with those of a rich cast of characters, and, after many twists and turns, come to a stunning and shocking climax. Like The Thorn Birds, Colleen McCullough's new novel is at once a love story and a family saga, replete with tragedy, pathos, history and passion. As few other novelists can, she conveys a sense of place: the desperate need of her characters, men and women, rootless in a strange land, to create new beginnings.",

A History of Christianity will be fascinating reading for anyone interested in one of the most powerful influences on global civilization.Starting with Christianity's origins as a Jewish sect, the author shows how Europe was converted; and then how the Christian faith was accepted by the Americas, much of Africa and parts of the East. He discusses the effects of the faith on the lives of believers throughout two millennia: the mutually uneasy relationship of the early Christians with the State; the rise of great monastic and clerical institutions, the different holy orders and their roles in disseminating the faith; Christ's imitators, and the canonization of exemplary Christians; the coming of the Protestants, and their attitudes towards work, worship and religious toleration; and Christianity's decline in Europe but expansion into the wider world, alongside twentieth-century issues such as the emancipation of women, birth control, Muslim fundamentalism, Nazi racism and Marxist atheism.In addition, he explains the evolution of the faith's artistic expression: the development of ecclesiastical architecture, from discreet house churches in the Roman age, via the soaring splendour of the Middle Ages, to the studios of the TV evangelists; the rituals, including the interpretations of the sacred texts, vestments, and the rise of choral music, from oratorio to hymns and spirituals. He discusses the Church's role in caring within the community - both medical and pastoral care - and its shifting attitudes to cruelty and war, from the martyrdoms of the Spanish Inquisition to the pacifism of this century.",

Now, in Breach of Promise, Nina takes on the biggest case of her career, a high-profile, high-stakes palimony suit that could make her millions or ruin her financially.  Little does she suspect that it will place her dead center in a bizarre and perplexing murder investigation.At glitzy Lake Tahoe, couples break up every day, but none quite so glamorous or successful as Lindy and Mike Markov.  The scenario starts off in the standard way: Mike's met a younger woman and wants out.  The problem? Mike and Lindy built a $200-million business together and Mike claims he doesn't owe Lindy a dime since they never married.Ready to fight, Lindy hires Nina Reilly to represent her in her palimony suit.  Lacking the resources to handle a case with stakes this high, Nina hires an expert litigator in palimony law, who in turn brings in a jury consultant to ensure that the makeup of the jury is to their advantage.  Now Nina's working with a desperate, unstable client and slick big-city legal professionals on the kind of case\u2014full of passion, raw emotion, and explosive secrets--that could make a fortune for a struggling lawyer.
