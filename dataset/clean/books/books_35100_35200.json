        "Description": "A riveting new Temperance Brennan forensic thriller from Kathy Reichs, the internationally acclaimed forensic anthropologist and New York Times bestselling author...  Temperance Brennan, forensic anthropologist for both North Carolina and Quebec, has come from Charlotte to Montreal during the bleak days of December to testify as an expert witness at a murder trial.   She should be going over her notes, but instead she's digging in the basement of a pizza parlor. Not fun. Freezing cold. Crawling rats. And now, the skeletonized remains of three young women. How did they get there? When did they die?  Homicide detective Luc Claudel, never Tempe's greatest fan, believes the bones are historic. Not his case, not his concern. The pizza parlor owner found nineteenth-century buttons in the cellar with the skeletons. Claudel takes them as an indicator of the bones' antiquity.   But something doesn't make sense. Tempe examines the bones in her lab and establishes approximate age with Carbon 14. Further study of tooth enamel tells her where the women were born. If she's right, Claudel has three recent murders on his hands. Definitely his case.  Detective Andrew Ryan, meanwhile, is acting mysteriously. What are those private phone calls he takes in the other room, and why does he suddenly disappear just when Tempe is beginning to hope he might be a permanent part of her life? Looks like more lonely nights for Tempe and Birdie, her cat.  As Tempe searches for answers in both her personal and professional lives, she finds herself drawn deep into a web of evil from which there may be no escape. Women have disappeared, never to return....Tempe may be next.  With its powerful mix of nail-biting suspense and cutting-edge forensic science, Monday Mourning is the best yet from this superbly gifted, megastar author who, as New York Newsday says, is \"the real thing.\"",

        "Description": "Arkady Renko returns for his most enigmatic and baffling case: the death of one of Russia's new billionaires, which leads him to the Zone of Exclusion -- Chernobyl, and the surrounding areas closed to the world since the nuclear disaster of 1986.  In his groundbreaking Gorky Park, Martin Cruz Smith created one of the iconic detectives of contemporary fiction, Arkady Renko. Cynical, quietly subversive, brilliantly analytical and haunted by melancholy, Renko has survived, barely, the journey from the Soviet Union to the New Russia, only to find his transformed nation just as obsessed with secrecy, corruption and brutality as was the old Communist dictatorship.  In Wolves Eat Dogs, Renko enters the privileged world of Russia's new billionaire class. The grandest of them all, a self-made powerhouse named Pasha Ivanov, has apparently leapt to his death from the palatial splendor of his posh, ultra-modern Moscow condominium. While there are no signs pointing to homicide, there is one troubling and puzzling bit of evidence: in Ivanov's bedroom closet, there's a mountain of salt.  Ivanov's demise ultimately leads Renko to Chernobyl and its environs. (No one knows how many deaths resulted from the explosion in Reactor Number 4. The official government figure is just 41, though many experts estimate that the toll was really a half million or more.) It is a ghostly world, still aglow with radioactivity, now inhabited only by the militia, shady scavengers, a few reckless scientists, and some elderly Ukrainian peasants who would rather ignore the Geiger counters than relocate. Renko's journey to this netherworld, the crimes he uncovers there and the secrets they reveal about the New Russia, make for a tense, unforgettable page-turning adventure.  Each of Martin Cruz Smith's novels is a ticket to an unknown world. Wolves Eat Dogs is Smith's most harrowing trip yet.",

        "Description": "American Spartans is the first modern battle history of the Marines in a generation, showing exactly how \"the few and the proud\" have performed in key conflicts from Iwo Jima to the present, and how they have prepared and reinvented themselves between the wars. From the islands of the Pacific, to Korea, to the Middle East, the Marines' strategies and tactics have evolved considerably during the past six decades, yet in every conflict they have proven themselves to be America's finest warriors.Supported by dozens of interviews, hundreds of print sources, and firsthand observation of Marine training and exercises, James Warren offers a lively history of the frontline heroes, colorful personalities, and far-ranging strategists who have made the Marines what they are today. American Spartans shows how the Marines have maintained such basic, timeless precepts as \"first in, last out,\" and \"every man a rifleman,\" across every decade, and despite many changes in warfare, technology, and opponents.The Marines themselves are keenly aware of the lessons of history and of the great Marines of the past. They are more conscious of their role in famous battles, and moments and careers of courage, than any other branch of the armed services. They also know, as Warren explains, that their way of life has been threatened repeatedly by political and bureaucratic attempts to overcome their independence.As James Warren shows, the real lesson of Marine history is that they have been our elite all along, and we have much to learn from them.",

        "Description": "From America's # 1 bestselling crime writer comes the extraordinary new Dr. Kay Scarpetta novel.  The \"book of the dead\" is the morgue log, a ledger in which all cases are entered by hand. For Kay Scarpetta, however, it is about to take on a new meaning. Fresh from her bruising battle with a psychopath in Florida, Scarpetta decides it's time for a change of pace, not only personally and professionally but geographically. Moving to the historic city of Charleston, South Carolina, she opens a unique private forensic pathology practice, one in which she and her colleagues-including Pete Marino and her niece, Lucy-offer expert crime-scene investigation and autopsy services to communities lacking local access to modern, competent death investigation technology.  It seems like an ideal situation, until the new battles start-with local politicians, with entrenched interests, with someone whose covert attempts at sabotage are clearly meant to run Scarpetta out of town. And that's before the murders and other violent deaths even begin.  A young man from a well-known family jumps off a water tower. A woman is found ritualistically murdered in her multimillion-dollar beach home. The body of an abused young boy is discovered dumped in a desolate marsh. Meanwhile, in distant New England, problems with a prominent patient at a Harvard-affiliated psychiatric hospital begin to hint at interconnections that are as hard to imagine as they are horrible.  Kay Scarpetta has dealt with many brutal and unusual crimes before, but never a string of them as baffling, or as terrifying, as the ones confronting her now. Before she is through, that book of the dead will contain many names-and the pen may be poised to write in her own.  The first name in forensics. The last name in suspense. Once again, Patricia Cornwell proves her exceptional ability to entertain and enthrall.",

        "Authors": "By Clark, Melissa, Thomas, Mark (PHT), and Ford, Faith",
        "Description": "Beloved comic actress Faith Ford puts a fresh and healthy new spin on down-home cooking with 125 updated Southern classics and traditional favorites cooked by three generations of her family.  You wouldn't know it by looking at her -- either during her years as Corky Sherwood on CBS's Murphy Brown or now on her hit ABC comedy Hope & Faith -- but Faith Ford loves to eat.  Growing up in Pineville, Louisiana, Faith learned how to cook the great Southern classics from her mother and grandmother: Old-Fashioned Smothered Chicken, Mom's Smoky Beef Brisket, Southern-Style Fried Catfish, Cora's Skillet Candied Sweet Potatoes, Snap Beans and New Potatoes, Buttermilk Biscuits, Fluffy Lemon Icebox Pie, and more.  Then, at age seventeen, she left Pineville for a modeling and acting career in New York City and later Los Angeles. She longed for the comforting foods of home but sought to adapt them to match her new, California, health-conscious sensibility. Thus began a lifetime of experimentation in the kitchen, developing healthier versions of foods from her childhood by cooking with olive oil; incorporating loads of vegetables -- staples on the family farm in Louisiana -- into every meal; oven-frying; and using chopped fresh herbs for maximum flavor. The delicious results -- Golden Crispy Oven-Fried Chicken; Broiled Red Snapper with Olives, Onions, and Tomatoes; Grilled Veggie Po' Boys; Dilled Egg White Salad; Green Beans Braised with Balsamic Vinegar and Soy Sauce; Asparagus with Tarragon Vinaigrette; Peaches-n-Creamy Shake; and Sweet Summer Melon-Mint Salad -- regularly wow friends in Los Angeles and have even won over Mom and the folks back home.  An inspired combination of the best of both worlds -- the homespun, heirloom dishes Faith grew up on (because every once in a while you need to indulge and only the \"real thing\" will do) and her own healthier, more modern versions and creations -- Cooking with Faith is also about the bonds that grow between family and friends as they spend time together in the kitchen. After all, says Faith, \"well-made food is an experience. It's about taking pride in what you eat. It's a remedy for an increasingly fast-food-reliant society -- I mean, how can you be that much in a hurry?\"",

        "Title": "American Heroes: In the Fight Against Radical Islam (War Stories)",
        "Authors": "By North, Oliver and Holton, Chuck (EDT)",
        "Description": "What is a Hero? New York Times best-selling author Oliver North says, \u201cReal heroes are selfless. Those who serve America in harm\u2019s way in the war against radical Islam have that quality in abundance. And so do their families and loved ones at home. Yet, they rarely get the attention or coverage they deserve.\u201cDespite the way they are presented by too many in the press and politics, the men and women in uniform today are overwhelmingly good. I never cease to be amazed at the self-discipline of these brave young Americans. They can endure the adrenaline-pumping violence of an enemy engagement, and then, just minutes later, help school children get safely to their classes . . . No nation\u2014ours included\u2014has ever had a military force better than the one we have today. I\u2019m proud of them. You should be too.\u201d\u00a0In American Heroes (a New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post best seller), North offers an inspiring, first-hand account of the extraordinary men and women defending America against radical Islamic terror from his perspective as a forty year member of the United States military, a member of the National Security Council staff and serving as the U.S. government\u2019s counter-terrorism coordinator from 1983-1986. This patriotic book also pulls in new reports and exclusive full-color photographs from War Stories, the award-winning FOX News Channel series hosted by North.\u00a0Endorsements\u00a0\"Oliver North has spent his life among America\u2019s heroes. This book with its moving words and powerful images will inspire patriots, reassure the faint of heart, and infuriate our nation\u2019s adversaries. These are our heroes, they deserve to have their story told, and no one is better to tell it than Col. North, because when it comes to heroes, it takes one to know one. This book is a treasure.\"\u2014Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House of Representatives and New York Times bestselling author of Real Change\"Ollie North has \u2018been there\u2014done that\u2019 with the American heroes who are winning the war against radical Islamic terror. This book is a magnificent tribute to the warriors who defend us all.\"\u2014Sean Hannity, host of The Sean Hannity Show and FOX News Channel\u2019s Hannity & Colmes",

        "Description": "In this wonderfully evocative volume, following the outstanding success of The Hornet's Nest, Christmas in Plains, and his classic, An Hour Before Daylight, Jimmy Carter writes about the things that matter most, the simple relaxed days and nights that he has enjoyed with family and friends through the years and across generations.  Here are lively and witty accounts of exploring the outdoors with his father and with black playmates; making furniture; painting; pursuing new adventures and going places with children, grandchildren, and friends. He describes how he learned to share life with his wife, Rosalynn -- and how they both learned how to grant each other personal space -- and to compete with her on the tennis court, high mountains, trout streams, and ski slopes.  These lifetime experiences can be an inspirational guide to anyone desiring to stretch mind and heart and to combine work and pleasure.",

With her monumental bestsellers Treason, Slander, and High Crimes and Misdemeanors, Coulter has become the most recognized and talked-about conservative intellectual in years\u2014and certainly the most controversial. Now, in How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must), which is sure to ignite impassioned debate, she offers her most comprehensive analysis of the American political scene to date. With incisive reasoning, refreshing candor, and razor-sharp wit, she reveals just why liberals have got it so wrong.In this powerful and entertaining book, which draws on her weekly columns, Coulter ranges far and wide.

After all, she writes, \u201cNothing too extreme can be said about liberals because it\u2019s all true.\u201d How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must) offers Coulter\u2019s unvarnished take on: \u2022The essence of being a liberal: \u201cThe absolute conviction that there is one set of rules for you, and another, completely different set of rules for everyone else.\u201d\u2022John Kerry: \u201cA reporter asked Kerry, \u2018Are you for or against gay marriage?\u2019 As usual, his answer was, \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201d\u2022Her 9/11 comments: \u201cI am often asked if I still think we should invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity. The answer is: Now more than ever!\u201d\u2022The state of the Democratic Party: \u201cTeddy Kennedy crawls out of Boston Harbor with a quart of Scotch in one pocket and a pair of pantyhose in the other, and Democrats hail him as their party\u2019s spiritual leader.\u201d  \u2022Her philosophy for arguing with liberals: \u201cTough love, except I don\u2019t love them. My \u2018tough love\u2019 approach is much like the Democrats\u2019 \u2018middle-class tax cuts\u2019\u2014everything but the last word.\u201d\u2022The \u201cTreason Lobby\u201d: \u201cWant to make liberals angry?

Waking up after a fantastic night unlike anything he's ever experienced, he discovers that his girlfriend, Jody\u2014the woman of his dreams\u2014is a vampire. And surprise! Now he's one, too.For some couples, the whole biting-and-blood thing would have been a deal breaker. But Tommy and Jody are in love, and they vow to work through their issues. Like how much Jody should teach Tommy about his new superpowers (and how much he needs to learn on his own). Plus there's Tommy's cute new minion, sixteen-year-old goth girl Abby Normal. (Well, someone has to run errands during daylight hours!)Making the relationship work, however, is the least of Jody and Tommy's problems. Word has it that the vampire who nibbled on Jody wasn't supposed to be recruiting any new members into the club. Even worse, Tommy's erstwhile turkey-bowling pals are out to get him, at the urging of a blue-dyed Las Vegas call girl named (duh) Blue. And that really sucks.",

        "Description": "In Spoon River Anthology, the American poet Edgar Lee Masters (1869\u20131950) created a series of compelling free-verse monologues in which former citizens of a mythical Midwestern town speak touchingly from the grave of the thwarted hopes and dream of their lives. First published in book form in 1915, the Anthology was the crowning achievement of Masters' career as a poet, and a work that would become a landmark of 20th-century American literature.In these pages, no less than 214 individual voices are heard \u2014 some in no more than a dozen moving lines. Alternately plaintive, anguished, enigmatic, angry, and contemptuous, the voices of Spoon River, although distinctively small-town Americans, evoke themes of love and hope, disappointment and despair that are universal in their resonance. This American classic is reprinted here from the authoritative 1915 edition.",

        "Title": "The Jesus Papers: Exposing the Greatest Cover-Up in History",
        "Authors": "By Baigent, Michael",
        "Description": "What if everything you think you know about Jesus is wrong? In The Jesus Papers, Michael Baigent reveals the truth about Jesus's life and crucifixion. Despite\u2014or rather because of\u2014all the celebration and veneration that have surrounded the figure of Jesus for centuries, Baigent asserts that Jesus and the circumstances leading to his death have been heavily mythologized.As a religious historian and a leading expert in the field of arcane knowledge, Baigent has unequaled access to hidden archives, secret societies, Masonic records, and the private collections of antiquities traders and their moneyed clients. Using that access to full advantage, Baigent explores the religious and political climate in which Jesus was born and raised, examining not only the conflicts between the Romans and the Jews, but the strife within the different factions of the Jewish Zealot movement. He chronicles the migrations of Jesus's family, his subsequent exposure to other cultures, and the events, teachings, and influences that were most likely to have shaped his early years. Baigent also uncovers the inconsistencies and biases in the accounts of the major historians of Jesus's time, including Josephus, Pliny, and Tacitus. The enduring influence of these accounts in forming our most common conceptions of Jesus reveals that spin is not a new phenomenon.Taking us back to sites that over the last twenty years he has meticulously explored, studied, and in some instances excavated for the first time, Baigent provides a detailed account of his groundbreaking discoveries, including many never-before-seen photos. The evidence he has uncovered has lead him to make shocking new assertions that threaten the conventional account of Jesus's life and death and shake the very foundation of Western thought, based as it is upon the assumption of Jesus's divinity. Ultimately, his investigation raises the hope that we may gain a new understanding of Jesus.",

        "Description": "In his third book, Uh-Oh, Robert Fulghum shared some short and somewhat unconventional love stories from his own experiences and casually suggested that if readers had their own tales to tell, he would love to hear them. To his surprise, his mailbox was soon stuffed with thousands of real-life love stories sent to him by his devoted fans. He used his nationally syndicated newspaper column to solicit additional material, and he also sat in a coffee shop in Seattle with a sign that read, Tell me a short love story and I will buy you coffee and make you famous. True Love is the result of the incredible response he received. These stories, specially chosen by Fulghum to reflect the many faces of love, are amusing, sentimental, and sometimes gritty - and bound to touch the hearts of all.There's the story of a woman who marries her mother's high school flame, a man who learns that \"old love\" and new pajamas are a dangerous mix, a man who miraculously reunites with his first love (after twenty years of separation) on an L.A. freeway, a husband's love for his wife after her disabling stroke, a fourteen-year-old's philosophy of looking for love on the boardwalk, and a smile shared at a stoplight.",

        "Title": "Winning the Future: A 21st Century Contract with America",
        "Authors": "By Gingrich, Newt",
        "Description": "According to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, America currently faces five threats that could undermine, if not eliminate, the United States if immediate steps are not taken to correct them. The threats as he sees them are Islamic terrorists and rogue dictatorships armed with nuclear or biological weapons; the removal of God from American public life; a loss of patriotism and sense of America's history; a decline in economic supremacy because of poor science and math education; and the increasing budgetary burden of Social Security and Medicare. To tackle these problems, Gingrich offers his \"21st Century Contract with America,\" which he outlines in great detail in this bold and thought-provoking book. His updated contract, which comes a decade after the original Republican Contract with America that marked the high point of Gingrich's national power, calls for a dramatically simplified tax code that favors savings and investment; government investment in science and technology, particularly regarding space, energy, and the environment; transforming Social Security into personal savings accounts; overhauling the civil justice system to reduce the burden of lawsuits; and updating the federal government, including the privatization of some functions, so that it moves at the speed and effectiveness of the information age. And that's just the beginning. He also calls for tripling the size of America's intelligence community, reforming its election system, developing a more intelligent health care system that creates jobs and increases quality of life, and balancing the federal budget.Gingrich believes that this ambitious agenda can be accomplished, but only if it receives grassroots support. The entrenched political system, with its lobbyists, bloated bureaucracies, and the complicity of the media, is too self-serving to fix itself, he stresses. Concise and clearly presented, Winning the Future is long on specifics and short on rhetoric, and it succeeds as a springboard for political discourse. Gingrich's aim is clearly to inspire citizens to take responsibility for the county's direction by demanding more of their government and their leaders.",

From a comfortable suburb of Columbus, Ohio, emerges a story of rebellion, faith and hope, bridging the cultural gap between those who believe in miracles and those who wish they could.Monroe Anderson\u2013as quiet on the outside as he is sardonic and alive on the inside\u2013has spent most of his eighteen years trying to fly beneath the radar. If he can remain invisible, he believes, his sadistic older brother, a rising golf star, might not torment him, his workaholic father, a renowned litigator, might not notice him long enough to be disappointed, and his mother might not have to struggle so hard to find a hopeful word. The only people who glimpse the real Monroe are his girlfriend, Emily, and his eleven-year-old sister, Annika. On the night of his senior prom, Monroe finds Annika floating facedown in the family pool. He dives in and rescues her, but not quickly enough to prevent her from slipping into a coma. As the family copes with this crisis, Monroe\u2019s mother turns to religion, his father turns to liquor, and Monroe himself must decide what\u2019s worth believing in, what\u2019s worth fighting for, and, finally, who he wants to be.By turns humorous and heartbreaking, personal and sweeping, familiar and extraordinary, Brian Strause\u2019s mesmerizing novel takes readers on an unforgettable emotional journey into America\u2019s heartland.",

The aristocratic earl has called together the entire Elstyn family to disclose the beneficiaries of his fortune, and all present will be affected. When Bill and Lori arrive at Hailesham, the earl's grand Palladian country house, they find that a beautiful dove-shaped topiary on the grounds is ablaze.

Someone has a grudge against the Elstyns and will stop at nothing to get revenge. The burning topiary, a suspicious maid, family secrets, and threatening notes lead Lori to seek her phantom Aunt Dimity's help in identifying the culprit before he or she can torch the whole house - with the guests in it.
