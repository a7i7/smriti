        "Authors": "By Callahan, John",
        "Description": "Is it possible to find humor -- corrosive, taboo-shattering, laugh-till-you-cry humor -- in the story of a 38-year-old- cartoonist who's both a quadriplegic and a recovering alcoholic? The answer is yes, if the cartoonist is John Callahan -- whose infamous work has graced the pages of Omni, Penthouse, and The New Yorker -- and if he's telling it in his own words and pictures. But Callahan's uncensored account of his troubled -- and sometimes impossible -- life is also genuinely inspiring. Without self-pity or self-righteousness, this liberating book tells us how a quadriplegic with a healthy libido has sex, what it's like to live in the exitless maze of the welfare system, where a cartoonist finds his comedy, and how a man with no reason to believe in anything discovers his own brand of faith.",

        "Title": "Martha Inc.: The Incredible Story of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia",
        "Authors": "By Byron, Christopher M.",
        "Description": "Martha Stewart has generated an enormous following by establishing herself as the leading authority for all things domestic and in the process created a multimillion-dollar enterprise and a personal net worth of nearly $2 billion. As one of the most successful self-made female business owners in American history, Martha Stewart is a topic of interest for fans, business professionals and would-be entrepreneurs alike.Martha Inc. tells the compelling story of how this complex woman created an empire on domesticity and examines her business inside and out. Through an engaging narrative by popular columnist Christopher Byron, this book chronicles how the business was built, what it took to take it public, and the personal and professional transformation Martha has undergone to make it all work. To get a true portrait of the woman whose work ethic is her personal life, Byron delves into the underreported facets of Martha's past, such as the effects her challenging childhood and years on Wall Street have had on her uncompromising business acumen. From Martha Stewart Living magazine and marthastewart.com to a K-Mart line of houseware products, a line of house paints, and a television show, this book details how a former caterer from Connecticut has created a media and merchandising empire, pulling off what large media corporations with vast resources struggle to accomplish.Martha Stewart has sold America on good taste and now readers can learn exactly how she did it and what drives her to keep conquering new vistas. A corporate biography as well as a success story worthy of Horatio Alger, Martha Inc. also delves into how a cult of personality is created and how Martha Stewart capitalized on the zeitgeist that characterized the last half of the twentieth century. This book is a must read for anyone who has been touched by Martha's marketing savvy or who dreams of making it big.",

        "Title": "Utopian Communities in America 1680-1880 (Formerly titled \"Heavens On Earth\")",
        "Authors": "By Holloway, Mark",
        "Description": "Throughout history, mankind has had the ever-recurring dream of creating perfection. In America, many of these dreams were put to the severe test of reality. More than 100 religious and socialistic communities were formed in the nineteenth century alone, in a widespread movement that involved over 100,000 men, women, and children. Though nearly all the communities were bitter failures and many seem to us today extremely na\u00efve, they nevertheless made valuable contributions to American life \u2014 particularly in the fields of education, women's rights, and the abolition of slavery. For these contributions, as well as the communities' own great intrinsic interest, they deserve and repay our consideration.This book gives a fascinating account of the history of several dozen of the most important and typical American utopian communities, emphasizing the Shaker communities, New Harmony, Brook Farm, the Fourieristic phalanxes, and the Oneida settlements in particular. The book is crammed with details of human interest and material on daily life, often quoted directly from the writings of residents and visitors. There are descriptions and accounts of the constitutions, revelations, beliefs, tenets, etc., of the communities; their customs as dictated by religious belief or social principle; the physical appointments of living quarters, dining rooms and work areas; the arrangements for care of children; community dances, songs, and other amusements; the communities' attitudes toward sex; the character and personality of the leaders and founder; and much, much more.Stimulating and fascinating from beginning to end, this book is a popular but accurate study of one of America's most engrossing adventures. As interesting to the lay reader as it is to the historian or the sociologist, it promises absorbing reading and presents many ideas well worth mulling over long after the book is back on the shelf.\"An entertaining and in some ways a very instructive book.\" \u2014 Times (London) Literary Supplement.",

In the wake of our nation's tragedy, poetry has taken on a new relevance in people's lives. As Dinitia Smith noted in The New York Times, \"In the weeks since the terrorist attacks, people have been consoling themselves-and one another-with poetry in an almost unprecedented way.\"Poems to Live By features sixty of the finest poems by an international group of distinguished writers, including W. H. Auden, Czeslaw Milosz, Bertolt Brecht, Yehuda Amichai, Mary Oliver, Miguel de Unamuno, Gwendolyn Brooks, Billy Collins, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Sharon Olds. Agreeing with Kenneth Burke that literature is equipment for living, Murray has arranged the anthology in six sections that address our most urgent concerns: death and remembrance, fear and suffering, affirmations and rejoicings, warnings and instructions, war and rumors of war, meditations and conversations.Beginning with Faiz Ahmed Faiz's somber remembrance ('This is the way that autumn came to the trees: / it stripped them down to the skin') and concluding with D. H. Lawrence's simple and deep-felt \"Pax,\" Poems to Live By addresses our need for wisdom in dark times, whether those times are personal or the ones we live through together.",

While dreaming that her cooking will be her ticket out of Persia, she cleaves to Mattie, the irrepressible black woman who runs the kitchen; to Will, the troubled, quiet boy she falls in love with; and eventually to Sheila Jones, a reclusive young girl who has returned with her mother from California to the town after her father's death. But when a young black boy suddenly disappears and the town erupts in violence, Fannie is the only one who can piece the story together. What she uncovers is as unexpected as it is heartbreaking.The Persia Cafe examines the ordinariness of racism, and what people will do to one another in the name of loyalty. It is a story of a place where dreams are paid for in blood. But it is also about a woman who has other, perhaps even more complex business to attend to as she confronts a vastly transforming world, and the personal search she must make, the difficult question she must ultimately ask: How do you forgive those who show no regret, or even understanding?",

But there are others on Guernsey with reason to want Guy Brouard dead: his wives, his business associates, his current mistress, the underprivileged teenagers he mentored\u2014any of whom might have harbored a secret motive for murder.

And behind all the lies and alibis, a killer is lurking.   In order to bring this person to justice, the St. James must delve into Guernsey\u2019s dark history\u2014both past and present\u2014and into the troubled psyche of someone who may have exacted retribution for the most unspeakable crime of all.In A Place of Hiding, bestselling novelist Elizabeth George marks new territory in the darker landscapes of human relationships. She tells a gripping, suspenseful story of betrayal and devotion, war and remembrance, love and loss...and the higher truths to which we must all ultimately answer.",

But in her 63rd bestselling novel, Danielle Steel proves  that when two hopelessly mismatched people share a love for art, a passion for each  other, and a city like Paris, nothing is truly impossible\u2026or is it?  Everything Sasha  does is within the boundaries of tradition. Liam is sockless in December.  Sasha  is widowed, a woman who knows she was lucky enough to be married to the most wonderful  man in the world and thankful for every moment they had. Liam is half in and half  out of a marriage that only a \u201cwacky\u201d artist could manage, and that his own impossibly  impulsive behavior has helped tear apart. But while Sasha has been methodically building  her father\u2019s Parisian art gallery into an intercontinental success story, Liam has  been growing into one of the most original and striking young painters of his time.  So while the two are utterly unalike\u2013and a nine-year age difference stares them squarely  in the face\u2013the miracle of art brings them crashing together. Now the question is,  can Sasha guard her reputation while juggling a secret, somewhat scandalous relationship?  And how can Liam, who lives for the moment, put up with a woman who insists on having  things her own way, in her own style, and at her own time?  For Sasha, it\u2019s a matter  of keeping Liam hidden from her grown children and well-heeled clientele as she commutes  between New York and Paris and two thriving galleries. For Liam, it\u2019s about creating  chaos out of order, bringing out the wild streak that Sasha barely knows she has,  of choosing pizza over foie gras, and making love when others are busy making money.   That is, until a family tragedy suddenly alters Liam\u2019s life\u2013and forces a choice  and a sacrifice that neither one of them could have expected.  But from the snow  falling on the Tuileries to the joy of eating ice cream by candlelight, the artist  and the art dealer have tasted perfection.  And giving up now might just be the most  impossible thing of all.  With unerring insight into the hearts of men and women\u2013 and into the soul of the artist \u2013Danielle Steel takes us into a world of glamour  and genius, priceless art and dazzling creativity. From the luxurious galleries of  Europe to the endless beaches of the Hamptons, ImPossible weaves an extraordinary  tale of love and compromise, of taking chances and counting blessings.  With brilliant  color and breathtaking emotion, Danielle Steel has written her most compelling novel  to date.",

It presents both a haven and opportunity, and, this summer, it plays host to a varied cast.Grief has nearly destroyed Hudson DeForest. He's barely been going through the motions, teaching in a Memphis girls school, writing about film, talking to the dog. He's hanging on by a thread. It's been two years since Kate died, two years of grappling with profound loss, with the impact of the marriage of a lifetime cut short.Hudson's friend Charlie Brompton, the successful developer and restaurateur, is facing a different loss. He's growing old. It's time for him to let go of his most beloved enterprise, the mecca of fine dining known as the 26-A after the panhandle highway where it sits. And of its funky adjunct, The Blue Bar. With no immediate family as heirs, Charlie's considering his choice of successors. And what he should do for his godson, Chaz? He also wonders if Hudson will return to Laurel Beach, to the cottage he occupied with Kate. Will Hudson ever forgive him?Meanwhile Chaz has met Sydney, a former actress. They're living well in Atlanta, thinking about marriage. Thinking, too, that perhaps they should go to Laurel Beach, touch base with Charlie....As Hudson settles in and doggedly takes up his summer project--he has a book contract for a collection of his film reviews--the undying past and a present struggling to be born exert their fierce, and sometimes indistinguishable, claims. So it is for Charlie, and for Sydney and Chaz.Gradually a bizarre maelstrom of deceit, betrayal, and murder evolves in Laurel Beach, ensnaring the wealthy and the beautiful, the misguided and the desperate. Will its force fill Hudson with newfound determination to celebrate life--or will it destroy those he still holds dear?In his first novel, Hadley Hury paints an evocative picture of the Gulf Coast and a moving portrait of grief and renewal, underpinning the suspense with reviews of films that eerily mirror the events overtaking his characters.",

        "Description": "William Safire, one of America's most influential political columnists, applies the Book of Job to the politics of today. In The First Dissident he shows how modern heroes have reshaped authority and history - and how individual citizens can, too - by following the courageous example of Job.The Bible's Book of Job is the story of a good man who dares to challenge God's judgment. Job's search for the answer to apparent injustice in God's design has stirred religious controversy and inspired readers for 2,500 years. Tennyson called the Book of Job \"the greatest poem of ancient and modern times.\" D. H. Lawrence described it as \"the story of your own soul.\"Safire's provocative exploration interprets Job - the innocent, angry sufferer - as the original dissenter. He shows how the biblical story can serve as inspiration and instruction manual for modern leaders and citizens, a primer on effective protest - when to dissent, how to force authority to listen, what kinds of persuasion work, why it is important for leaders to avoid isolation. He illuminates the timeless role of dissent in shaping power and influencing even the highest authority. And he draws modern-day parallels in the struggles of such human rights leaders as Mustapha Barzani, Martin Luther King, Jr., Natan Sharansky, Vaclav Havel, and others.The First Dissident is written in William Safire's insightful style of informal scholarship and is studded with anecdotes and examples drawn from Safire's wide-ranging political experience in the White House as speechwriter and in covering global politics for The New York Times. The First Dissident reaches across the millennia to show how any person, armed with a sense of righteousness, can engage with higher authority to protest unfair treatment - and thereby change the world.",

Runway Madness is a personal invitation to New York's infamous Fashion Week. More than 100 arresting photographs by Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Lucian Perkinsmany never published until nowtell the behind-the-scenes story of this unparalleled fashion event. Perkins captures the models up-close and personal: Kate Moss without make-up, Naomi Campbell in curlers, and Shalom Harlow, Amber Valetta, Christy Turlington, and many others in high pomp as well as unguarded circumstance. Also exposed are the fashion editors and buyers, journalists, and stars whose high-visibility presence is essential. Quotes from fashion insiders provide a running commentary and captions by Washington Post fashion writer Robin Givhan explain each image. The beat, the lights, the cascade of beauty and color: this is not only a performance, but also a performance art. Long and lean like the runway itself, Runway Madness is the total high fashion experience.",

His voice can calm wild horses and his touch heal broken spirits.  For secrets uttered softly into pricked and troubled ears, such men were once called Whisperers.

        "Description": "Legendary civil rights reporter Karl Fleming began his life in the flat, bleak, poverty-stricken tobacco landscape of Eastern North Carolina. Raised from age eight to seventeen in a tough, all-white Methodist orphanage, Fleming learned to survive bullying and to brawl among a pack of boys with nicknames like Snot-Eye, Cootie Roach, and Fatty Clark. He learned how to plow behind a mule, milk cows, hoe vegetables, and to adhere to the orphanage's strict code of conduct. Largely isolated from the world around him until he was introduced to racism and sex during his first newspaper job in the small town of Wilson, North Carolina, Fleming went on to become Newsweek magazine's chief civil rights reporter, covering all of the South's hot spots throughout the 1960s. He reported on James Meredith's enrollment at the University of Mississippi, Bull Connor's suppression of the 1963 Birmingham marches with fire hoses and dogs, the Birmingham church bombings, Alabama Governor George Wallace's schoolhouse door stand in Tuscaloosa, KKK rallies, the violence in Selma, the assassination of Medgar Evers, and the murders of three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi. Fleming was beaten and almost killed on the streets of Watts, California, and was present when Martin Luther King, Jr. was laid to rest in Atlanta, Georgia.In Son of the Rough South, Fleming writes about how his past as a bullied orphan made him an impassioned civil rights reporter, and about how the demons of that same past nearly consumed him once that enormous story left many of its headlines behind.",

        "Description": "In 1997, writer Patricia Stacey and her husband Cliff learned that their six-month-old son Walker might never walk or talk, or even hear or see. Unwilling to accept this grim prediction, they embarked on a five-year odyssey that took them into alternative medicine, the newest brain research, and toward a new and innovative understanding of autism. Finally their search led them to pioneering developmental psychiatrist Stanley Greenspan who helped them save their son and bring him into full contact with the world. This enthralling memoir, at once heart wrenching and hopeful, takes the reader into the life of one remarkable family willing to do anything to give their son a rich and emotionally full life. We stand witness as they struggle to elicit the first sign that Walker is connecting with them, and share in their fears, struggles, tiny victories, and eventual triumphs. The Boy Who Loved Windows is compelling and inspiring reading for parents and professionals who care for children with autism and other special needs. The book is also a stunning literary debut, of interest to anyone who cares about the lives of children and the passion of families who, against huge odds, put these children first.",

The Adamses played a leading role in America's affairs for nearly two centuries -- from John, the self-taught lawyer who rose to the highest office in the government he helped to create; to John Quincy, the child prodigy who followed his father to the White House and fought slavery in Congress; to Charles Francis, the Civil War diplomat; to Henry, the brilliant scholar and journalist. Indeed, the history of the Adams family can be read as the history of America itself. For when the Adamses \"looked at their past, they saw the nation's,\" writes author Richard Brookhiser. \"When they looked at the nation's past, they saw themselves.\" America's First Dynasty charts the family's travels through American history along with an impressive cast of characters, among them George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Ulysses S. Grant, and Theodore Roosevelt. Brookhiser also details the darker side of the Adams experience, from the specters of alcoholism and suicide to the crushing burden of performance passed on from father to son. Yet by putting a human face on this legendary family, Brookhiser succeeds in creating an impassioned, heroic family portrait that the American public is not likely to forget.",

        "Title": "A Changed Man: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Prose, Francine",
        "Description": "On an unseasonably warm spring afternoon, a young neo-Nazi named Vincent Nolan walks into the Manhattan office of World Brotherhood Watch, a human rights foundation headed by a charismatic Holocaust survivor, Meyer Maslow. Vincent announces that he wants to make a radical change in his life. But what is Maslow to make of this rough-looking stranger who claims to have read Maslow's books, who has Waffen-SS tattoos under his shirtsleeves, and who says that his mission is to save guys like him from becoming guys like him?As he gradually turns into the sort of person who might actually be able to do that, Vincent also transforms those around him: Maslow, who fears that heroism has become a desk job; Bonnie Kalen, the foundation's fund-raiser, a divorced single mother and a devoted believer in Maslow's crusade against intolerance and injustice; and Bonnie's teenage son, Danny, whose take on the world around him is at once openhearted, sharp-eyed, and as fundamentally decent as his mother's.Masterfully plotted, darkly comic, A Changed Man illuminates the everyday transactions in our lives, exposing what remains invisible in plain sight in our drug-addled and media-driven culture. Remarkable for the author's tender sympathy for her characters, A Changed Man poses the essential questions: What constitutes a life worth living? Is it possible to change? What does it mean to be a moral human being? The fearless intelligence, wit, and humanity that inform this novel make it Francine Prose's most accomplished yet.",

        "Authors": "By Wolff, Tobias",
        "Description": "The author of the genre-defining memoir This Boy\u2019s Life, the PEN/Faulkner Award\u2013winning novella The Barracks Thief, and short stories acclaimed as modern classics, Tobias Wolff now gives us his first novel.Determined to fit in at his New England prep school, the narrator has learned to mimic the bearing and manners of his adoptive tribe while concealing as much as possible about himself. His final year, however, unravels everything he\u2019s achieved, and steers his destiny in directions no one could have predicted. The school\u2019s mystique is rooted in Literature, and for many boys this becomes an obsession, editing the review and competing for the attention of visiting writers whose fame helps to perpetuate the tradition. Robert Frost, soon to appear at JFK\u2019s inauguration, is far less controversial than the next visitor, Ayn Rand. But the final guest is one whose blessing a young writer would do almost anything to gain.No one writes more astutely than Wolff about the process by which character is formed, and here he illuminates the irresistible power, even the violence, of the self-creative urge. Resonant in ways at once contemporary and timeless, Old School is a masterful achievement by one of the finest writers of our time.",

        "Authors": "By Roe, Caroline",
        "Description": "The spring of 1355 brings unexpected changes in Girona. For Isaac the physician, it is time to bid farewell to his student Yusuf, who has become a well-loved member of the family. After thinking him dead for years, Yusuf's blood kin have discovered his whereabouts, and are eager for his return home to Grenada.As Yusuf sets off on his journey, a stranger arrives at the doorstep of Raimon Forestar, one of Isaac's patients. Raimon has lately been plagued by distrubing memories in the form of nightmares. Now the bad dreams grow worse after the stranger, claiming to be his half-brother, Guillem, takes up residence at the finca. No one can ignore the striking resemblance between Raimon and Guillem, yet the two could not be more different in character, and the manipulative Guillem's obvious greed for a share of Raimon's property soon brings chaos - and worse - to the once-peaceful household.Meanwhile, Yusuf faces challenges of his own as he tries to acquit himself appropriately at the court of his cousin, Muhammad V, Emir of Grenada. Although he is overjoyed to be reunited with his mother and sisters, two narrow escapes make it clear to Yusuf that someone within the castle walls is less than happy about his return. Fleeing for his life, the boy heads for the only truly safe haven he knows.As political, religious, and familial intrigue once again converge on Girona, Isaac copes with the sudden passing of a patient. It is the most distressing kind of loss - for no doctor can prevent death by another's hand. Now, Isaac must use all of his skills and every clue at his disposal to untangle an elaborate web of lies, secrets, and ambition - before another victim is claimed.",

        "Title": "The Sword of Lincoln: The Army of the Potomac",
        "Authors": "By Wert, Jeffry D.",
        "Description": "The Sword of Lincoln is the first authoritative single-volume history of the Army of the Potomac in many years.  From Bull Run to Gettysburg to Appomattox, the Army of the Potomac repeatedly fought -- and eventually defeated -- Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia. Jeffry D. Wert, one of our finest Civil War historians, brings to life the battles, the generals, and the common soldiers who fought for the Union and ultimately prevailed. The obligation throughout the Civil War to defend the capital, Washington, D.C., infused a defensive mentality in the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac. They began ignominiously with defeat at Bull Run. Suffering under a succession of flawed commanders -- McClellan, Burnside, and Hooker -- they endured a string of losses until at last they won a decisive battle at Gettysburg under a brand-new commander, General George Meade. Within a year, the Army of the Potomac would come under the overall leadership of the Union's new general-in-chief, Ulysses S. Grant. Under Grant, the army marched through the Virginia countryside, stalking Lee and finally trapping him and the remnants of his army at Appomattox.  Wert takes us into the heart of the action with the ordinary soldiers of the Irish Brigade, the Iron Brigade, the Excelsior Brigade, and other units, contrasting their experiences with those of their Confederate adversaries. He draws on letters and diaries, some of them previously unpublished, to show us what army life was like. Throughout his history, Wert shows how Lincoln carefully oversaw the operations of the Army of the Potomac, learning as the war progressed, until he found in Grant the commander he'd long sought.  With a swiftly moving narrative style and perceptive analysis, The Sword of Lincoln is destined to become the modern account of the army that was so central to the history of the Civil War.",
