        "Description": "\"America's top gossip columnist spills the beans as she traces five decades of battling press agents and editors and landing celebrity scoops.\" (Variety) From Tallulah Bankhead to Joan Crawford to the Kennedys and Madonna, the ultimate insider, Liz Smith, has hobnobbed, air-kissed, and lunched with just about everybody who's been anybody over the last half century and then rushed to tell the world all about it. Now, in this candid, down-to-earth autobiography, she tells all about herself, and does it with the kind of style and warmth that has made her one of the most widely read columnists in history. But she wasn't always famous, and in Natural Blonde she reveals how a young woman from rural Texas came to New York hell-bent on making something of her life. From her salad days as a small-time reporter, typist, and proofreader to her triumphs at the Daily News, Newsday, New York Post and her 1995 Emmy for reporting, Liz tells what it's really like to be seen and heard by millions of people every day. One of the most-quoted people of our time, she offers a rare, private peek into the real person behind the witty quips and media coverage. Certainly one of the most eagerly anticipated autobiographies in years, Natural Blonde will give Liz Smith readers the item they've been waiting for the ultimate inside scoop from the \"Grande Dame of Dish.\"",

        "Title": "Quest for Adventure: Ultimate Feats of Modern Exploration",
        "Authors": "By Bonington, Chris",
        "Description": "There is a special breed of person who thrives on risk, for whom an unconquered mountain or an unexplored ocean represents an irresistible challenge. Some are world-famous -- Hillary, Heyerdahl, Chichester -- while others are known only to a tightknit group of their peers, but all share certain hallmark qualities: a fierce desire to be first and best; a deep commitment to their goals; and most important of all, a kind of determination and endurance that is even more spiritual than physical.  Chris Bonington understands the powerful allure of adventure, and in this enthralling book he chronicles a generous selection of the most remarkable and daring exploits of the past half-century. A record-setting mountaineer, he's the perfect guide to some, of the world's most remote, forbidding, and dangerous places, from the blazing sands of the Sahara to the frigid Antarctic ice cap, from the blinding white of a Himalayan blizzard to the pitch-black depths of an underground river. Along with the first-person story of his own pioneering ascent of Annupurna's treacherous South Face, Bonington presents vivid accounts of 16 other epics -- on land, on water, and in the air.  We voyage across the Pacific with Thor Heyerdahl's crew on the primitive balsa raft called Kon-Tiki and ride the jet stream around the world in the gondola of the uItra-modern Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon. We free-climb the vertiginous face of El Capitan and follow the footsteps of solo climbers into the Death Zone of Karakoram peaks. We cling alone and desperate to a tiny, dismasted sailboat in an Antarctic ocean gale, fight gun battles with murderous bandits during the first boat descent of the rapid-strewn Blue Nile, cave-dive hundreds of feet beneath the English hills, and much more.  This book isn't just a lively narrative of 17 great adventures; its also an expert overview of the history, lore, and techniques of aeronautics, ocean sailing, mountaineering, and polar trekking, to name just four, as well as a wonderful portrait gallery of scores of colorful figures, familiar names, and unsung heroes alike. Finally, it's a fascinating analysis of the wide variety of styles and personalities drawn to adventuring, observed with the keen eye of an experienced insider.  Highlighted by more than 125 photographs, illustrations, and maps, these truly suspenseful tales of triumph -- and often tragedy -- offer a wonderful panorama of adventuring and its all-or-nothing champions, the extraordinary men and women who feel most alive when they are on the very edge of a perilous unknown.",

His subjects range from the internals of the movie projector to the emotional tribulations of reading aloud; from the disappearance of hybrid punctuation to the mechanics of changing one's mind; from the lexicography of dirty talk to the manufacture of the fingernail clipper. There is a wedding address, a study of the not-so-random books that are used as props in mail-order catalogs, and a recipe. The final essay, which appears in print here for the first time, pursues through several centuries of prose and poetry the vagaries of the word lumber as a metaphor for the contents of the human mind, in what becomes in the telling a dazzlingly pedantic case study of the fanaticism of scholarship and the beauty that can reside within a piece of ordinary language.",

An online storefront goes up and a company's market capitalization goes through the roof, despite low sales and no profits. But now the race to get online is over. As the new economy rapidly becomes the only economy, Internet companies must learn how to create sustainable value if they're going to survive. This book provides the solid business basics companies need to move from the old era of .com to the next era of .profit.Nick Earle, the driving force behind Hewlett-Packard's worldwide Internet strategy, and Peter Keen, a visionary in the world of business and technology, have been anticipating online trends and communicating them to managers for over twenty years. Here they team up to forecast the future of Internet commerce and to lay out the six key imperatives that will determine the difference between successful and unsuccessful e-business in the coming decade.Earle and Keen show managers how to perfect the logistics, cement the relationships, build the brands, transform the capital and cost structures, harmonize the sales channels, and provide the services that are crucial to delivering both value and profits on the Web.Using examples from HP and other top companies around the world, the authors go beyond Internet hype to lay out strategic action in the key areas of technology, finance, and marketing. In the process, they provide all the useful information, timely insights, and practical advice managers need to build business plans for the new economy that really work.",

        "Description": "The book opens with Tim suddenly waking from a strange dream. He's been reading late into the night about today's hot scientific topic - quantum physics - and what he's learned about the nature of reality really disturbs him. Fortunately, he's got plenty of time to mull it over. Tim's wife and daughter are going away on a camping trip, and Tim is left at home with their dog, Spot. At first, he's excited at the opportunity to eat what he wants (bologna and potato chip sandwiches), watch the sci-fi videos he loves, and finish the 1946 Ford he's been restoring so he can deliver it to a car show on Monday. Unfortunately, he can't find the final part: a one-of-a-kind hood ornament. He encounters very strange coincidences, meets people he doesn't know who seem to know too much about him, and wonders if his life is half full or half empty.As he roams from room to room, Tim ponders how we wind up sounding like our parents when we raise our own children (\"Don't stir your ice cream into soup!\"), men's fascination with pricey gadgets (\"Does this drill bit set really cost $89,000?\"), and how romantic \"chemistry\" really works (\"It's all based on salt\"). He describes his own rise to celebrity and what it's like to buy groceries without wearing a mask. He explores the allure of hot cars, the temptation of fast-food chain prizes which seem to be getting bigger and bigger all the time (\"I'll have the happy meal and the Harley, please\"), and his obsession with his place in the cosmos.I'm Not Really Here deals, in the Toolman's inimitable way, with some of the urgent questions a man faces at midlife, from \"What is real?\" to what should he eat for breakfast (\"The gummy cinnamon buns or the cereal no one can pronounce? Moose lips. Mouse licks\"). This book is a culmination of a five-year journey of self-discovery. It will surprise and challenge, make you wonder and think, and induce laughter on every page.",

Are people in the spirit world affected by the actions of their loved ones on earth? Can suicide cause someone to turn away from the light? Will we be reunited with our cherished pets on the other side? These questions, among others, are answered.But in Proud Spirit Rosemary goes beyond the landscape of death, presenting exquisitely simple teaching stories that shine a light on human conduct. We meet the heroic bystander who \"intrudes\" to defend a small boy against his father's verbal abuse, the daughter who \"rapes\" her father by callously rejecting his apology, and the woman who learns that self-denigration is too great a price to pay for a relationship.In a provocative section called The Laws of the Universe, Rosemary and Grey Eagle address some of the most divisive issues of our time, including racial prejudice, abortion, and homosexuality. Sure to initiate discussion and debate, Rosemary asks whether the Ten Commandments are relevant today, as she surveys the many religious traditions of the world.",

Matthew soon discovers that the jewel of the old man's cache is none other than the Holy Mother of Katarini -- a sacred icon long thought destroyed in a fire. But while Matthew recognizes the icon's value as a work of art -- and a star in his crown if he can add it to the museum's collection -- he soon discovers that it carries a far greater significance to numerous people, including his owngrandfather and godfather. What Matthew does not realize is that his own connection to the icon will thrust himinto a byzantine web of death and deception, as other parties -- including a representative of the Greek Orthodox Church, a Russian \"entrepreneur,\" a dying gangster, and a Nazi who has escaped the wartime tribunals for nearly six decades -- pursue it for their own means. All believe the icon to be a source of fantastic and inexplicable power, and all were somehow connected to the events that transpired in a small Greek village during World War II. As he experiences the peculiar resonance of the icon, and sees the hold it has on others, Matthew begins to understand that the only way out of his entanglement is to discover what really happened in that Greek village sixty years earlier. And he will soon be forced into a harrowing situation where he must decide who lives and who dies, and will have to reexamine virtually every aspect of his life -- the loyalties within his family, his feelings for Ana, and even the question of his own faith. Is the icon chiefly a relic of historic and artistic significance? Or is it something more still -- a vessel imbued with the spirit and power of Christ himself? In a stunning debut that spans more than half a century and two continents, The Icon asks us to reach into the very heart of all our questions about faith, power, and love.",

Yet, as the centuries pass, God feels more and more out of place in the world he has created; by the close of his memoir, he is packing his bags.Highly praised and widely reviewed, The Life of God is a playful, wondrous, and irresistible book, recounting thousands of years of religious and philosophical thought.\"A supreme but imperfect entity, the protagonist of this religiously enlightened and orthodoxically heretical novel is possessed by a raving love for his skewed, unbalanced world. . . .

But it's his reason for visiting Colonel Mann in the first place that is by far Ames's greatest concern.His orphaned young cousin, Valentine, has made a most desirable match, but she has unfortunately been indiscreet, and the love letters she wrote during a failed summer romance have somehow fallen into Colonel Mann's hands. If her fiance were to discover her indiscretion, he would break their engagement, so Ames must recover the letters to save Val from social ostracism. But the missives in question are not to be found in the inconveniently dead blackmailer's hotel room. Only by finding the killer will he be able to prevent Val's heartbreak and disgrace.",

Mary Higgins Clark's interest in George Washington was first sparked by a radio series she was writing in the 1960s, called \"Portrait of a Patriot,\" vignettes of American presidents.  Always a lover of history, she wrote this biographical novel -- her first book -- and titled it Aspire to the Heavens, which was the family motto of George Washington's mother. With all events, dates, scenes and characters based on historical research, the book was published in 1969.  Its recent discovery by a Washington family descendent led to its reissue under its new title, Mount Vernon Love Story.  In researching George Washington's life, Mary Higgins Clark was surprised to find the engaging man behind the pious legend. He was a giant of a man in every way, starting with his physical height. In an era when men averaged five foot seven inches, he towered over everyone at six foot three. He was the best dancer in the colony of Virginia.

        "Title": "The Day Before Yesterday - Reconsidering America's Past, Rediscovering the Present",
        "Authors": "By Elliott, Michael",
        "Description": "Americans have assumed for fifty years that the years after World War II were normal, and that any deviation from that standard is alarming. In fact, the boom period following World War II, the Golden Age, was a historical aberration. Although it had its roots in the American past, much of the prosperity came out of the country's unique position in the world of 1945. Of all the nations on the planet, only the United States emerged unscathed from the three decades of war and revolution that had crippled all the other great industrial powers - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan. As a result, in 1945 the U.S. reigned supreme.Then, between the assassination of JFK and the end of the Cod War in 1989, all the factors that had contributed so much to America's self-image went into reverse. American politics went through a period of murderous instability; the federal government was delegitimized; great divisions grew among races, regions, and classes; a wave of immigration transformed the country's ethnic makeup; and the economy slowed down.Now the major debate among politicians is how to fix America's decline. Elliott puts that debate in perspective by showing that we're in a natural cycle, not an absolute decline, and reminds us that we won't find the solutions in the shiny model of the Golden Age. Those circumstances will never be repeated. Instead, by looking back to the whole of American history, especially to the period before 1914, Elliott offers explanations and some hopeful answers for our current problems. Then, as now, America was a society of immigrants, messy, ragged at the edges, transfixed by cultural wars and suffering serious social cleavages. America was also home to unprecedented pioneering spirit and extraordinary resourcefulness. America today is still characterized by the same sense of community and entrepreneurial vision that enabled us to overcome our problems a hundred years and more ago and become the most powerful and prosperous nation in the world.",

Someone has broken into a greenhouse, trashed some plants, and stolen a batch of seed that was being dried. And, in a second incident, vials with genetic material have been stolen from two students who were studying how genes affect growth.Just pranks, or sabotage? And if the events are malicious, are they aimed at individuals or the entire lab? Crawford and Raskin don't want to involve the university or police authorities any more than necessary for fear of losing precious funding should any scandal emerge. It's safer, by far, to put their problems into Catherine's capable hands.But when two researchers die in mysterious circumstances, Catherine knows there's far more at stake than sabotaged research. And she must work alone, as Kendra Crawford and her colleagues seem unwilling to admit the seriousness of the situation.Catherine must also deal with the psychological wounds left by previous violent cases and her growing attraction to Paul Raskin, who threatens to become more than just a client.As she delves deeper into the case, she uncovers a startling secret that takes her beyond the maize research team's small sphere of greenhouses and labs into the high-stakes world of biotech . . . and she moves one step closer to a deadly confrontation with a killer.",

        "Authors": "By Drury, Allen",
        "Description": "\"We live in the Republic of Feel-Good in a time when all the scum of America is rising to the top.\"  So begins Public Men, the final novel of \"the University trilogy\" in which Pulitzer Prize winner Allen Drury concludes some fifty years in the lives of the members of the World War II generation whose stories he began on the eve of the war in the novel Toward What Bright Glory?  The second novel, Into What Far Harbor?, carries them on through the challenges, triumphs, and tragedies of the war and on to the years when they must worry about their world and the world of their children against the backdrop of the later Vietnam War.  Now in Public Men, set in the year 2000, when most are either about to embark upon, or have already entered, their eighties, the fifteen who remain of the original twenty-six meet for a last reunion on the beautiful campus where they shared a fondly remembered fraternity house and the hopes and dreams of youth confronted by history's most chaotic and ominously foreboding century.  Public Men concerns them all, but overshadowing their lives as in the two previous novels is the life of Richard Emmett Wilson -- \"Willie,\" now and for many years a United States Senator from his native California; his legislative triumphs on Capitol Hill; the tragic death of his first wife, Donna; his second and third marriages; his political disagreements with, but ultimate pride in, his older son Latt as Latt follows in his footsteps into the House of Representatives and then into the Senate; and, finally, Willie's campaign for president, threatened by other personal tragedies, most devastatingly those of his gentle, vulnerable younger son, Amos.  Through it all, Willie, often in alliance with Tim Bates, does battle against what he sees as the \"phony liberalism\" of his famous fraternity brother Dr. Ren\u00e9 (\"Renny\") Suratt; and Renny and his powerful friends of academe and the media in turn do battle with what they see as the \"reactionary conservatism\" of Willie and his friends. Tim, wielder of a savage commentator's pen, refers to \"Renny and his crew\" as \"the scum\" he attacks. Renny responds with equally scathing pen and matching contempt. As with many of the public men in Public Men, these three fraternity brothers sum up what they regard as the major political and social issues of end-of-the-millennium twentieth century.  Allen Drury skillfully meshes the public and private lives of his characters against the Washington world that has formed the rich backdrop of many of his",

        "Title": "Identity's Architect: A Biography of Erik H. Erikson",
        "Authors": "By Friedman, Lawrence J.",
        "Description": "One of the most profound thinkers of the twentieth century, Erik H. Erikson was the architect of the \"identity crisis\" and the \"life cycle\" -- concepts that are now a familiar part of today's culture. Identity's Architect is the first comprehensive and authorized biography of Erikson, postwar America's most influential psychoanalyst, who acutely reshaped our views of human development.  Drawing on private materials and extensive interviews with Erikson's family, students, and closest colleagues around the world, award-winning historian Lawrence J. Friedman illuminates the relationship between Erikson's personal life and his groundbreaking ideas. This book lays bare the identity crisis that was at the root of this remarkable man's lifelong quest to discover who his father was.  Friedman insightfully shows how Erikson's famous eight-stage model of the human life cycle grew from the birth of his third son, who was born developmentally handicapped. Even Erikson's acclaimed studies of Luther, Gandhi, Jefferson, and Jesus were inseparable from his life circumstances.  The writing and ideas of Erik Erikson have had a remarkably lasting influence on our culture. Erikson's fascination with India and with Gandhi earned him the Pulitzer Prize for his book Gandhi's Truth and foreshadowed the contemporary West's growing interest in Eastern thought. His students at Harvard in the 1960s have gone on to great prominence -- Carol Gilligan, Robert Coles, Mary Catherine Bateson, and Howard Gardner to name a few. Trained in Vienna by Sigmund and Anna Freud, Erikson came to depart from psychoanalytic orthodoxy in deeply innovative ways -- insisting that social circumstances were no less important than the inner psyche in determining human personality.  This exhaustively researched, compelling biography, which has been ten years in the making, is indispensable for anyone who hopes to fully understand one of the most significant intellectual figures of our time.",

        "Title": "War by Other Means: Economic Espionage in America",
        "Authors": "By Fialka, John J.",
        "Description": "The hard facts behind an attack on the American economy so deadly as to constitute a time-lapse Pearl Harbor. In 1811 Francis Cabot Lowell visited England and stole a large piece of the industrial revolution, the Cartwright loom, whose plans he had memorized. Today, the town named after him, Lowell, Massachusetts, is an economic wasteland. We have forgotten the lessons of Lowell's success; in fact, the techniques he pioneered are now being used against us. In this action-filled journey through tomorrow's headlines, John Fialka, award-winning investigative reporter for the Wall Street Journal, reveals a secret war that threatens the economic security of the United States and the livelihood of millions of American citizens. The ground rules have changed, and the battlefield is now economic rather than ideological, but espionage in the 1990s springs directly from the ruins of the Cold War spy regimes. Newly configured, the secret operations of America's enemies threaten to hollow out the U.S. economy and siphon away the jobs and technologies we need to remain competitive in the twenty-first century. From the stunning ruse of Operation \"Farewell\"Russia's brazen shopping tour for U.S. secretsto technology \"tunneling\" (a very subtle form of theft) by the Japanese, to China's clever use of U.S. campuses, companies, and consumers to modernize its military, this book illuminates a loss that is widely felt, but not often seen or understood. The techno-thieves have many tools, but their principal weapon is the openness of our society, and the defenders are hobbled by witnesses too embarrassed to complain and by laws aimed at nineteenth-century threats. This book outlines the hard choices we must make if we are to survive.",

        "Authors": "By Downs, Hugh (EDT)",
        "Description": "\"Some of these essays are powerful and poetic. Some seem to reflect a stunned condition on the part of the contributor. But all of them share a newborn or reawakened feeling about the country we live in -- an underlying concern for it, whether that concern is rooted in anger and fear, or in a sensed and urgent need for action, or internal correction, or wagon-circling. Some are personal narratives that explain and justify the patriotism of the writer. Some examine and praise the values that make the country great.\"  -- Hugh Downs, from the Introduction  What is the essence of America? In this fascinating new collection inspired by one of our most trusted and beloved commentators, 150 diverse Americans -- from top politicians and entertainers to firefighters and teachers -- express in their own words what America means to them.  My America includes candid insights from television journalists such as Mike Wallace and Barbara Walters; politicians including former president George Bush and John Glenn; writers such as Walter Anderson and Anita Diamant; and entertainers, among them Dave Brubeck and Patricia Neal; as well as lesser-known citizens from all over the country. These frank and thought-provoking observations from Americans of every age, race, religion, and social position compellingly illustrate the American mosaic and offer a glimpse into the subconscious mind of this unique and wonderful nation. This touching volume, celebrating the similarities and the differences of a people, reflects our core values and is sure to inspire pride in America.  Edited and with an introduction and an epilogue by Hugh Downs -- who coanchored ABC's 20/20, hosted NBC's Today show, and has been an important American voice for more than half a century -- My America explores the values, ideals, and dreams that all Americans share. At a time when people are reassessing their patriotism and rediscovering their national allegiance, emotions regarding the United States are stronger and more poignant than they have been in years, and this sentiment has been captured in these pages.  My America is a timely collection for anyone who wants to reflect on America's past, or celebrate its future.",

        "Description": "With intrepid good spirits, author Bill Elliott interviews the world's foremost spiritual figures, acquainting us with their exuberant earthly charms as well as their insight and intelligence. Propelled since childhood by the untimely deaths of his parents, Elliott traveled the globe to meet with these luminaries and directly find out their answers to the fundamental questions of existence: What is life's purpose? What is God or Ultimate Reality? Why do people suffer? Does a part of us live on after death? The list of people he met is both diverse and impressive. Not only do they represent every major religious tradition, from Rober Schuller, Rabbi Harold Kushner, and Norman Vincent Peale to His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Jack Kornfield, but also an exciting variety of perspectives, from Ram Dass to Mother Teresa to psychologist B.F. Skinner.Time and again, the sages included here warmed to Elliott's heartfelt longing for meaning in the world. Their views are framed by Elliott's endearing voice, engaging and perceptive, and by his wonderfully warm sense of humor. Tying Rocks to Clouds is sometimes sad, often funny, and always filled with freshness and joy as it reveals wisdom collected from across the world.",

Soon after, a deadly disease appears in the United States and around the world. With no known cure or treatment, the plague-like affliction paralyzes its victims and creates a terrifying physical deformity that causes it to be called \"the Pinocchio Syndrome.\"Already reeling from intense political pressure, the president is heatedly denounced by an ultra-right-wing self-made billionaire, Colin Goss, who is determined to force him out of office. When word spreads that the well-liked vice president is incapacitated by the Pinocchio Syndrome, the search for a replacement to quell the nation's fears leads to Senator Michael Campbell, a former Olympic gold medalist whose youthful charisma marks him out for high public office.

Initially, he thought it would be neat . . . cool . . . a fun thing to do. It wasn't until he came to a spiritual crossroads and was able to give that dream up to discover the true desires of his heart before he actually got into the space shuttle program at NASA. Three failed attempts didn't daunt this driven pilot-and the fourth interview process, though lengthy and difficult, proved successful for him. Husband's years at NASA served not only to develop his integrity and character, but also to increase his faith in a Creator that could not be denied in the vastness of space. His story is not only inspirational but exhilarating and invigorating, as readers will witness the life of a man who consistently pursued the desires of his heart even as he served a faithful God.",

        "Authors": "By Robb, Daniel",
        "Description": "Off the coast of Cape Cod lies a small windswept island called Penikese. Alone on the island is a school for juvenile delinquents, the Penikese Island School, where Daniel Robb lived and worked as a teacher, not far from the mainland town where he grew up. By turns harsh, desolate, and starkly beautiful, the island offers its temporary residents respite from lives filled with abuse, violence, and chaos. But as Robb discovers, peace, solitude, and a structured lifestyle can go only so far toward healing the anger and hurt he finds not only in his students but within himself -- feelings left over from the broken home of his childhood.  Lyrical and heartfelt, Crossing the Water is the memoir of his first eighteen months on Penikese, and a poignant meditation on the many ways that young men can become lost.  Ranging in age from fourteen to seventeen and numbering up to eight at a time, Robb's students at Penikese have been convicted of crimes including arson, assault, and armed robbery. They are tough, troubled kids who are sentenced to the school by courts in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. During their time at Penikese, they live in a house together with the staff of four and share the responsibilities of living on the island -- chopping wood, cooking meals, maintaining and repairing the buildings, caring for the farm animals, and doing other chores. For many of the students, it's the first time they've experienced such a combination of discipline and freedom, or the kind of trust extended to them by the staff. And despite their resistance and sometime wildness, Robb soon finds that they have the capacity not only to confound but to surprise him, both with their insight and their vulnerability. In Crossing the Water, he renders the boys' voices and his life with them -- the confrontations, the rare epiphanies, the flashes of humor -- with great vividness.  Passionate, poetic, and deeply felt, Crossing the Water is a powerful and moving book, and the debut of a tremendously gifted young writer.",

W. H. Auden wrote his poem The Horatians from which the following lines are taken: We can only do what it seems to us we were made for, look at this world with a happy eye but from a sober perspective.   The poem was written in 1968. It was a year notable in the United States for assassination, riot, war, and political violence unseen for the preceeding 100 years. If humanity could be instructed to view that world with a happy eye, can America today do any less, faced with the clearest and most coherent expression of national unity since the Second World War? With a Happy Eye But . . . is both a clear description of the attitude that informs these collected pieces (and the attitude of their creator) and an admonition to Americans.",

        "Description": "From the author of Lords of the Horizons, the fascinating story of a new kind of money for a new world Money has always been at the heart of the American experience. Paper money, invented in Boston in 1698, was a classic of American ingenuity-and American disregard for authority and tradition. With the wry and admiring eye of a modern Tocqueville, Jason Goodwin has written a biography of the dollar, giving us the story of its astonishing career through the wilds of American history. Greenback looks at the dollar over the years as a form of art, a kind of advertising, a reflection of American attitudes, and a builder of empires. Goodwin shows us how the dollar rolled out the frontier and peopled the Plains; how it erected the great cities; how it expressed the urges of democracy and opportunity. And, above all, Goodwin introduces us to the people who championed-or ambushed-the dollar over the years: presidents, artists, pioneers, and frontiersmen; bankers, shady and upright; safecrackers, crooks, and dreamers of every stripe. It's a vast and colorful cast of characters, who all agreed on one thing: getting the money right was the key to unlocking liberty and the pursuit of happiness.Greenback delves into folklore and the development of printing, investigates wildcats and counterfeiters, explains why a buck is a buck and how Dixie got its name. Like Goodwin's Lords of the Horizons, another story of empire, Greenback brings together an array of quirky detail and surprising-often hilarious-anecdote to tell the story of America through its best-beloved product.",
