The American Century has passed, argues Starobin, due in large part to America's military overreach in the Middle East; resurgent nationalism and economic expansion in Russia, China, and India; the tarnished American model of free-market capitalism; and the growth of transnational institutions. Following an insightful analysis of America's globalascendancy, Starobin explores five possible scenarios: an age of chaos like the one following the collapse of the Roman Empire; a multipolar order of nations in which America would be one great power among others; China becoming the dominant superpower; an age of global city-states; or a form of world government. A concluding section explores how California--the eighth largest economy in the world and among the most sophisticated spots on the planet--is already starting to move beyond the American Century.--From publisher description.",

        "Title": "Dual Attraction: Understanding Bisexuality",
        "Authors": "By Weinberg, Martin S., Williams, Colin J., and Pryor, Douglas W.",
        "Description": "For the past two generations, extensive research has been conducted on the determinants of homosexuality. But, until now, scant attention has been paid to what is perhaps the most mysterious--and potentially illuminating--variation of human sexual expression, bisexuality. Today, as ignorance and fear of AIDS makes greater awareness of all forms of sexual behavior an urgent matter of private and public consequence, leading sex researchers Martin Weinberg, Colin Williams, and Douglas Pryor provide us with the first major study of bisexuality. Weinberg, Williams, and Pryor explore the riddle of dual attraction in their study of 800 residents of San Francisco. Fieldwork, intensive interviews, and surveys provided a wealth of data about the nature of bisexual attraction, the steps that lead people to become bisexual, and how sexual preference can change over time. They found that heterosexuals, more often than homosexuals, become bisexual; that bisexual men and women differ markedly in their sexual behavior and romantic feelings; that most bisexuals ultimately settle into long-term relationships while continuing sexual activity outside those relationships; and they also explain why transsexuals often become bisexual. Moreover, the authors discovered that as the AIDS crisis unfolded, many bisexual men entered into monogamous relationships with women, and bisexual women into more lesbian relationships. Recent media accounts attest that a growing number of researchers and writers are narrowing the fundamental cause of sexual preference to a single factor, biology. But if, as this study shows, learning plays a significant part in helping people traverse the boundaries of gender, if past and present intimate relationships influence their changing preferences, and if bisexual activity is inseparable from a social environment which provides distinctive sexual opportunities, then a mosaic of factors far more complex than those previously considered must be entertained in explaining the fuller spectrum of sexual preferences. Dual Attraction is one of the most significant contributions to our understanding of sexuality since the original Kinsey reports and Bell and Weinberg's 1978 international bestseller, Homosexualities. It is must reading for all those interested in the study of sexual behavior--especially now, since the onset of AIDS.",

Chapters then focus on tools; the concrete ways in which leaders can improve themselves, their organizations, those they coach; and the teams they establish to build effective relationships and the trust essential to success. Surveying agencies both horizontally and vertically, The Trusted Leader also addresses how public managers can collaborate with political appointees and the legislative branch, all the while engaging with citizens through modern technologies to build exceptional customer experiences.",

For millions of mothers and fathers, however, anticipation turns to anxiety when those initial, all-important words are a long time coming. Many worried parents are reassured that their child is \"just a late talker,\" but unfortunately, all too often that is not the case. Nineteen million children in the United States have serious speech disorders, such as apraxia of speech. For these toddlers, early and intensive speech therapy is crucial if they are to stand a chance of ever speaking normally. This book was written to help the worried parent cut through the confusion and stress to determine if their child needs help.The Late Talker is the first book of its kind, providing effective, practical answers to the questions every concerned parent asks. Written by Marilyn C. Agin, a highly respected developmental pediatrician, and Lisa F. Geng, a mother of two late talkers, it is a tremendously useful handbook that includes:- Ways to identify the warning signs of a speech disorder- Information on how to get the right kind of evaluations and therapy- Ways to obtain appropriate services through the school system and health insurance - Fun at-home activities that parents can do with their child to stimulate speech- Groundbreaking evidence of the promising and dramatic benefits of nutritional supplementation- Advice from experienced parents who've been there on what to expect and what you can do to be your child's best advocate",

In an ingenious selection of organizational stories, Morgan presents unique insights drawn from actual corporate (as well as non-profit, public and institutional) experience. These examples illustrate both organizational successes and failures - because we can learn from both. They are interwoven with excerpts from many of the \"classics\" in organizational literature. His aptly-named \"Mindstretchers\" entice readers to expand their personal repertoires of approaches to the understanding of, and solutions to, organizational problems and challenges, followed by cases and exercises that challenge us to view organizations in new ways.",

Only their precocious young daughter, Sabine, along with their sacrosanct public images, really binds them anymore. But when Sabine suddenly disappears at a European amusement park, Madison and Olivier are finally forced to deal with something other than their own reflections: fear. Frantically and uncharacteristically relying on each other for reassurance (Olivier's obsession with his new mistress notwithstanding), the two come together to search for their daughter and in the process confront the posturing realities of their marriage.",

        "Description": "The author presents a compelling look at how innovation transforms industries, raising the fortunes of some firms while destroying others. The book draws on the rich history of innovation by inventors and entrepreneurs--ranging from the birth of typewriters to the emergence of personal computers, gas lamps to fluorescent lighting, George Eastman's amateur photography to electronic imaging--to develop a practical model for how innovation enters an industry, how mainstream firms typically respond, and how--over time--new and old players wrestle for dominance. Utterback asserts that existing organizations must consistently abandon past success and embrace innovation--even when it undermines their traditional strengths. He sets forth a strategy to do so, and identifies the responsibilities of managers to lead and focus that effort.   Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation offers a pioneering model for how innovation unsettles industries and firms, and features fascinating histories of new product developments and strategies for nurturing innovation. \"The most valuable book I've read in years. . . . The analysis is brilliant.\"--Tom Peters. Available August 1996.",

Before her visit is over, Suzanne will unleash the forces of rage between Aaron and Jack, compelling one brother to commit an act against the other that can never be taken back.A decade later, living in New York, Lila still searches for Aaron, who disappeared that night, and Suzanne, whose mystique still exerts a hold on her memory.
