Cutting-edge research makes UltraLongevity the first and only book to explore aging within the context of the immune system, and it will change the way we look at health forever. Starting with a quiz---\"How Fast Are You Aging?\"---Liponis explains the new science, lays out an accessible and proven 7-step program with an 8-day meal plan, and motivates readers to put the program into practice so that they can keep their minds sharp, become more physically fit, be more resistant to infections and disease, and feel and stay younger than they ever imagined. Through the UltraLongevity program, Liponis promises more than a long life; he promises a long, healthy life. Advance praise for UltraLongevity\"What an awesome and practical anti-aging program! Dr. Liponis's approach to longevity is based on proven technological breakthroughs supported by hundreds of studies. This is the best original thinking I have seen in decades!\"-Stephen T.

When she speaks, they assume she speaks for him. They\u2019ve not seen him. They\u2019ve not met him. But they know his child, so they know his heart. In the setting of a Manhattan skyscraper, we learn the simplicity of how to make an impact for God, either good or bad. As Christians \u201cwe are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us\u201d (2 Corinthians 5:20) and when the work \u201cday\u201d is finished what will we hear? Lucado inspires us all to have \u201cno higher goal than to see someone think more highly of our Father, our King\u201d when they see us.",

Hartwell in his introduction to The Science Fiction Century, an anthology spanning a hundred years of science fiction, from its birth in the 1890s to the future it predicted.David G. Hartwell is a World Fantasy Award-winning editor and anthologist who has twice before redefined a genre--first the horror field with The Dark Descent, then the subgenre of hard science fiction with The Ascent of Wonder, coedited with Kathryn Cramer. Now, Hartwell has compiled the mother of all definitive anthologies, guaranteed to change not only the way the science fiction field views itself but also the way the rest of literature views the field.The Science Fiction Century includes stories from the founding fathers of the field, such as H.G. Wells, C.S. Lewis, Jack London, and Rudyard Kipling; beloved mainstays of the genre, such as Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer, Roger Zelazny, Jack Vance, and Poul Anderson; noted female writers, including Connie Willis, Nancy Kress, and James Tiptree, Jr.; and writers who have hit their stride in the last two decades, such as Bruce Sterling, William Gibson, Michael Swanwick, and James Morrow. Hartwell has also included writers widely recognized outside the genre, such as E.M. Forster, Michael Shaara, and John Crowley; and translations of foreign writers' formative works, including Dino Buzzati and Wolfgang Jeschke. This is must-have anthology for all literary interests.",

        "Title": "The Buried Mirror: Reflections on Spain and the New World",
        "Authors": "By Fuentes, Carlos",
        "Description": "In his introduction to this passionate history of Spain and the Spanish-speaking peoples of the Americas, Carlos Fuentes asks the necessary question: What do we really have to celebrate on the five hundredth anniversary of Columbus's historic voyage to the New World? After all, the quincentennial of the \"discovery of America\" finds the Latin American republics in a state of deep crisis, with inflation, unemployment, and excessive foreign debt threatening their still precarious economic and political institutions. But Fuentes finds much consolation in an amazingly rich cultural heritage, one that has been created with \"the greatest joy, the greatest gravity, and the greatest risk\" and that lives in art, in literature, and above all in the vital societies of Central and South America.From the mysterious cave drawings at Altamira to the explosive graffiti on the walls of East Los Angeles, images of Spain and the Americas speak to us of the great variety of Spanish culture. Carlos Fuentes knows this culture intimately. Combining a sophisticated perspective on world events and a novelist's eye for irony and metaphor, he weaves a historical narrative of dazzling color and vibrancy. Sweeping across centuries of tumultuous history, Fuentes gives new life to monarchs and conquistadors, to Indian cultures and revolutions, and finally to modern-day Spain, Latin America, and the Hispanic United States. History and its players come alive on every page, in the stories of the famous and the little-known, the heroes and tyrants, martyrs and saints, virgins and kings.Using the illuminating metaphor of mirrors, inspired by mirrors found in ancient burial caches in the Americas, Fuentes challenges us to think in new ways about how a national character is formed, how a stereotype evolves, and what continuities are discovered when a human community truly understands its roots. Illustrated with more than 160 stunning drawings, paintings, and photographs, The Buried Mirror celebrates a culture of enormous wealth and diversity, as Carlos Fuentes fulfills the poet Pablo Neruda's resounding cry, \"I am here to sing this history.\"",

Winner of Le Prix Mediations (France), and of the National Business Book Award (Canada) it has been translated into 21 languages and published in 25 countries.Named one of Ms Magazine's Women of Year in 2001, and declared by the Times (London) to be \"probably the most influential person under the age of 35 in the world,\" in Fences and Windows, Naomi Klein offers a bird's-eye view of the life of an activist and the development of the \"anti-globalization\" movement from the Seattle World Trade Organization protests in 1999 through September 11, 2001. Bringing together columns, speeches, essays, and reportage, Klein once again provides provocative arguments on a broad range of issues. Whether she is discussing the privatization of water; genetically modified food; \"free trade;\" or the development of the movement itself and its future post 9/11, Naomi Klein is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant activists and thinkers for a new generation.",

        "Description": "Why are we here? How should we live? What happens after we die? Why does evil exist?  Religion For Dummies explains how the world\u2019s great religions answer questions that persist through generations. Authors Rabbi Marc Gellman and Monsignor Thomas Hartman are trusted religious advisors known as the God Squad. With wonderful wit and incredible wisdom, they host a daily talk show which reaches nearly 4 million homes in the New York area, and have appeared on numerous TV and radio shows. This book is not a scholarly theological treatise; it\u2019s a lively, practical, hands-on resource that will help you better understand your own religion and others. You\u2019ll explore:  Religion's role in the family and in the workplace The beliefs and practices of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and other religions Religion's impact during major passages in life such as birth, death, and marriage How to join a religion and how to pray How religion can help you deal with issues in every day life such as conflict, adversity, marriage, divorce, and more Religious rituals and ethics  Religion for Dummies touches on lesser-known religions (such as, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, Sikhism). It explores how people of various faiths pray, celebrate life and death, and view moral issues. The book does not tell you what to believe, but rather encourages you to live as you believe and let your religion infuse every aspect of your life. It doesn\u2019t give simple answers to haunting, complex questions; it helps you find your own answers and pursue your own spiritual path!",

        "Authors": "By Halperin, Mark and Harris, John F.",
        "Description": "In The Way to Win, two of the country\u2019s most accomplished political reporters explain what separates the victors from the victims in the unforgiving environment of modern presidential campaigns.Mark Halperin, political director of ABC News, and John F. Harris, the national politics editor of The Washington Post, tell the story of how two families\u2013the Bushes and the Clintons\u2013have held the White House for nearly a generation and examine Hillary Clinton\u2019s prospects for extending this record in 2008. Based on years of research, including private campaign memos and White House communications, The Way to Win reveals the surprising details of how the Bushes and Clintons have closely studied each the other\u2019s successes and failures and used these lessons to shape their own strategies for winning elections and wielding power.In the case of George W. Bush, the strategic genius is Karl C. Rove, arguably the most influential White House aide in history. For the first time, Halperin and Harris cut through the myths and controversies surrounding Rove to illuminate in brilliant, behind-the-scenes detail what he actually does\u2013his Trade Secrets for winning elections.In the case of the Clintons, the chief strategist is Bill Clinton himself. Drawing on their fifteen years reporting on and interviewing him, Halperin and Harris deconstruct and decipher the Clinton style, identifying the methods that all candidates can use in their pursuit of the White House.The Way to Win takes a lively and irreverent approach, but Halperin and Harris also show the disturbing ways that American politics has become a Freak Show\u2013their name for a political culture that provides incentives for candidates, activists, interest groups, and the news media to emphasize ideological extremism and personal attack. For the first time, Halperin and Harris describe how Freak Show campaigns orchestrated by the likes of Internet pioneer Matt Drudge forced Al Gore and John Kerry to lose control of their public images (with considerable help from the candidates\u2019 own ineptitude) and lose the White House.On the brink of what will be one of the most intense, most exciting presidential elections in American history, The Way to Win is the book that armchair political junkies have been waiting for. Filled with peerless analysis and eye-opening revelations from the trenches, it is a must read for everyone who follows American politics.",

The wildest, funniest, and even most astute are collected here (along with their answers) in McLain's second volume that's as fascinating and enlightening as his first, Do Fish Drink Water? A \"veritable Internet legend known for having all the answers\" (San Francisco Chronicle), McLain explains what keeps squirrels from toppling off telephone wires; why the skin on your fingers and toes shrivels up in the water; how seedless watermelons are created; and more. Whether it's animal, vegetable, mineral, or something completely different, the answer is bound to be as interesting as the question itself, and certain to satisfy the trivia hound in everyone.",

To find the answers, Weaver must contend with a desperate prostitute who knows too much about his past, relatives who remind him of his alienation from the Jewish faith, and a cabal of powerful men in the world of British finance who have hidden their business dealings behind an intricate web of deception and violence. Relying on brains and brawn, Weaver uncovers the beginnings of a strange new economic order based on stock speculation - a way of life that poses great risk for investors but real danger for Weaver and his family.",

From building a high stone wall in the garden to learning that every kitchen deserves a good kitchen couch, Browning reminds us that making a home is more than just a materialistic endeavor -- it is a way for us to comfort and reinvent ourselves, to \"have the final word about what goes where...what feels comfortable, what is life enhancing...and gives us strength to go out and embrace the world.\"",

Growing   up in the perilous years between the fall of the last emperor and the Communist Revolution,   Chang Yu-i's life is marked by a series of rebellions: her refusal as a child to   let her mother bind her feet, her scandalous divorce, and her rise to Vice President   of China's first women's bank in her later years. In the alternating voices of two   generations, this dual memoir brings together a deeply textured portrait of a woman's   life in China with the very American story of Yu-i's brilliant and assimilated grandniece,   struggling with her own search for identity and belonging. Written in pitch-perfect   prose and alive with detail, Bound Feet and Western Dress is the story of independent   women struggling to emerge from centuries of customs and duty.",

        "Description": "A good mystery is the essential element in every compelling plot. Encyclopedia Mysteriosa clues you in to the entire murky realm of detection. This comprehensive reference is an in-depth compendium that draws on 150 years of crime stories from the genesis of the mystery genre with the publication of Edgar Allan Poe's \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" to the films of Alfred Hitchcock and television series like \"The Fugitive.\"Written and edited by two-time Edgar Award winner William L. DeAndrea, Encyclopedia Mysteriosa contains biographies of old and new writers and their memorable characters, as well as detailed entries on contributions to the genre on radio, television, and film. The evolution of the literature of detection progresses from the nineteenth-century master sleuths - Sherlock Holmes and Nick Carter - to the Golden Age when Ellery Queen and Agatha Christie produced their perennially popular stories. Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot can be found cheek-to-cheek with the hard-boiled detectives created by Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, and with the characters and writers who played out the espionage explosion of the sixties and seventies. You'll also find entries devoted to the current wave of women private eyes, a subgenre that was pioneered by Marcia Muller - the founding mother of the American female hard-boiled private eye - and continues with the popular alphabet mysteries of Sue Grafton. No story is too convoluted and no character is too small - you'll even find television and film detectives Maxwell Smart and Basil, the Great Mouse Detective.An appendix provides directories of organizations for the mystery devotee, mystery booksellers, and lists of major award-winning writers honored with Edgars and Diamond Daggers. All entries are copiously cross-referenced to assure easy access.For every would-be sleuth and armchair detective, Encyclopedia Mysteriosa is the complete reference to the entire genre of murder and mayhem.",

        "Authors": "By Life Extension Foundation (EDT)",
        "Description": "The public too often hears about a new life-saving therapy, only to be told that the treatment won't be available for many years. The Life Extension Foundation is proud to release the fourth edition of Disease Prevention and Treatment. This significantly expanded fourth edition provides 1,535 pages of concise information about therapies that are documented in the scientific literature, but are not routinely incorporated into clinical medical practice. Many of the recommendations in this latest edition of DiseasePrevention and Treatment provide inside information about what innovative physicians are doing to prevent and treat the degenerative diseases of aging. Disease Prevention and Treatment contains novel information that the general public and their doctors are largely unaware of. A few examples of the kind of unique information contained in this book include: \u00a2 A drug that is 92% effective in preventing the flu in people who have been exposed to influenza. \u00a2 A simple head positioning technique that resolves vertigo symptoms in 50% of cases. \u00a2 Proven methods to reduce prescription drug side effects while saving big dollars on your drug purchases. \u00a2 A nutrient that suppresses excess insulin production, resulting in reduced carbohydrate craving and subsequent body fat reduction. \u00a2 The devastating role that chronic inflammation plays in degenerative disease and novel methods of suppressing the inflammatory cascade. \u00a2 A simple blood test that predicts your risk of developing type II diabetes four years ahead of time. \u00a2 Hormone imbalances that cause mental depression and how you can correct these. \u00a2 FDA-approved drugs that fight cancer, but are over-looked by most oncologists. \u00a2 Novel methods to treat either constipation-or diarrhea type irritable bowel syndrome. \u00a2 Steps you can take right now to dramatically reduce stroke risk. \u00a2 Eight critical steps to controlling or curing cancer that are not routinely used in conventional oncology practice. \u00a2 The missing link that causes fibromyalgia patients to endure chronic pain. \u00a2 The most effective drug to alleviate the miseries of insomnia. \u00a2 Why anti-hypertensive drugs often fail to adequately control high blood pressure and how the dose can be adjusted to make them work better. \u00a2 The only therapy shown to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease (by 44%) over a 16-month study period. \u00a2 A nutritional protocol for autistic children that parents said doubled improvement in just eight weeks. \u00a2 A European drug that protects against glaucoma-induced optic nerve damage. \u00a2 A French drug that lowers infections associated with chronic bronchitis by 60% \u00a2 Precautions one should take when supplementing with DHEA. \u00a2 Safer estrogen replacement drugs to relieve menopausal miseries. \u00a2 An OTC drug that can knock out herpes outbreaks within 24 to 48 hours. This drug also shortens the duration of shingles (herpes zoster attacks). \u00a2 A superior method for treating acute heart attack (blocked coronary arteries) than currently used clot-dissolving therapies (such as tPA). \u00a2 Why hepatitis C treatment fails so often and a simple step that can be taken to circumvent this impediment. \u00a2 In-depth protocols to treat the leading types of cancer including prostate, breast and colon. \u00a2 A common hormone deficiency that contributes to age-associated mental impairment and congestive heart failure. The protocols discussed in this book are documented by thousands of published studies from internationally recognized scientific journals. Despite this bountiful evidence, the medical establishment largely ignores many of the therapies recommended in this book. The leading cause of death and disability today is ignorance about scientific approaches to prevent and treat degenerative disease. The novel information contained in Disease Prevention and Treatment could literally save your life.

        "Title": "The Terminal Spy: A True Story of Espionage, Betrayal and Murder",
        "Authors": "By Cowell, Alan S.",
        "Description": "In a page-turning narrative that reads like a thriller, an award-winning journalist exposes the troubling truth behind the world\u2019s first act of nuclear terrorism.On November 1, 2006, Alexander Litvinenko sipped tea in London\u2019s Millennium Hotel. Hours later the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 and former intelligence officer, who was sharply critical of Russian president Vladimir Putin, fell ill and within days was rushed to the hospital. Fatally poisoned by a rare radioactive isotope slipped into his drink, Litvinenko issued a dramatic deathbed statement accusing Putin himself of engineering his murder. Alan S. Cowell, then London Bureau Chief of the New York Times, who covered the story from its inception, has written the definitive story of this assassination and of the profound international implications of this first act of nuclear terrorism.    Who was Alexander Litvinenko? What had happened in Russia since the end of the cold war to make his life there untenable and in severe jeopardy even in England, the country that had granted him asylum? And how did he really die? The life of Alexander Litvinenko provides a riveting narrative in its own right, culminating in an event that rang alarm bells among western governments at the ease with which radioactive materials were deployed in a major Western capital to commit a unique crime. But it also evokes a wide range of other issues: Russia's lurch to authoritarianism, the return of the KGB to the Kremlin, the perils of a new cold war driven by Russia's oil riches and Vladimir Putin's thirst for power.   Cowell provides a remarkable and detailed reconstruction both of how Litvinenko died and of the issues surrounding his murder. Drawing on exclusive reporting from Britain, Russia, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the United States, he traces in unprecedented detail the polonium trail leading from Russia's closed nuclear cities through Moscow and Hamburg to the Millenium Hotel in central London. He provides the most detailed step-by-step explanation of how and where polonium was found; how the assassins tried on several occasions to kill Litvinenko; and how they bungled a conspiracy that may have had more targets than Litvinenko himself.\u00a0With a colorful cast that includes the tycoons, spies, and killers who surrounded Litvinenko in the roller-coaster Russia of the 1990s, as well as the \u00e9migr\u00e9s who flocked to London in such numbers that the British capital earned the sobriquet \u201cLondongrad,\u201d this book lays out the events that allowed an accused killer to escape prosecution in a delicate diplomatic minuet that helped save face for the authorities in London and Moscow.     A masterful work of investigative reporting, The Terminal Spy offers unprecedented insight into one of the most chilling true stories of our time.",

        "Authors": "By Bergner, Daniel",
        "Description": "Never before had Daniel Bergner seen a spectacle as bizarre as the one he had come to watch that Sunday in October. Murderers, rapists, and armed robbers were competing in the annual rodeo at Angola, the grim maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana. The convicts, sentenced to life without parole, were thrown, trampled, and gored by bucking bulls and broncos before thousands of cheering spectators. But amid the brutality of this gladiatorial spectacle Bergner caught surprising glimpses of exaltation, hints of triumphant skill.The incongruity of seeing hope where one would expect only hopelessness, self-control in men who were there because they'd had none, sparked an urgent quest in him. Having gained unlimited and unmonitored access, Bergner spent an unflinching year inside the harsh world of Angola. He forged relationships with seven prisoners who left an indelible impression on him. There's Johnny Brooks, seemingly a latter-day Stepin Fetchit, who, while washing the warden's car, longs to be a cowboy and to marry a woman he meets on the rodeo grounds. Then there's Danny Fabre, locked up for viciously beating a woman to death, now struggling to bring his reading skills up to a sixth-grade level. And Terry Hawkins, haunted nightly by the ghost of his victim, a ghost he tries in vain to exorcise in a prison church that echoes with the cries of convicts talking in tongues.Looming front and center is Warden Burl Cain, the larger-than-life ruler of Angola who quotes both Jesus and Attila the Hun, declares himself a prophet, and declaims that redemption is possible for even the most depraved criminal. Cain welcomes Bergner in, and so begins a journey that takes the author deep into a forgotten world and forces him to question his most closely held beliefs. The climax of his story is as unexpected as it is wrenching.Rendered in luminous prose, God of the Rodeo is an exploration of the human spirit, yielding in the process a searing portrait of a place that will be impossible to forget and a group of men, guilty of unimaginable crimes, desperately seeking a moment of grace.From the Hardcover edition.",

Special attention is paid to traps \u2014 both the mistakes often made by amateurs, and the classic traps, such as Greco's and Tarrasch's. \"Chess is a game of understanding and not of memory,\" says Znosko-Borovsky, and he promotes the reader's understanding of the openings by discussing purpose and plan frequently, as against memorization of moves.
