Lavishly illustrated with photos-many in full color-from the president's youth to his last days in office, hand-annotated documents, and everyday notes and doodles, and packaged with a 60minute CD containing the original recordings of some of Reagan's most memorable speeches, the book serves as a remarkable illustrated journey back in time. The journey starts with Reagan's childhood in Dixon, Illinois and includes his years in Hollywood; his marriage to Nancy Davis; his years as governor of California; the presidential campaigns; the assassination attempt; Reaganomics; his foreign policy; the Strategic Defense Initiative; the INF treaty; and Iran-Contra, and ends with Reagan's retirement and battle with Alzheimer's disease. A Gallup survey recently designated Reagan as the greatest president of all time, and Ronald Reagan: The Presidential Portfolio is a timely reference work and a beautiful gift.",

        "Title": "The Best of Gourmet: The World at Your Table",
        "Authors": "By Gourmet Magazine Editors",
        "Description": "Nowadays, everyone who entertains is looking for outstanding casual fare that will allow them to spend more time with their guests. Dishes must be quick and easy to prepare (or able to be made ahead) and filled with the purest ingredients for optimum flavor. The Best of Gourmet, Featuring the Flavors of Thailand is filled with twenty-eight such menus-most are very relaxed, all are absolutely delicious.For example, after a chilly day on the slopes, you may want to treat your houseguests to A Ski House Dinner. Begin the evening around the fire with champagne and a large platter of ever-so-tender smoked salmon with cilantro cream. Later, roasted veal chops with shallots, tomatoes, and olive jus nestled on pillows of soft polenta make a rich, indulgent entr\u00e9e. And before everyone retires, a heavenly warm chocolate raspberry pudding cake, made the day before and reheated, is served with a glass of cognac. When the summer heats up, why not spend A Weekend at the Shore with friends? You'll have three clever menus in hand that take advantage of the season's abundant fresh produce, include plenty of make-ahead dishes, and satisfy hearty seaside appetites. On Saturday morning you can serve Breakfast on the Beach with buttery-rich baked blueberry-pecan French toast. Lunch Indoors includes a serve-yourself composed salad of classic favorites and a lovely rhubarb rice pudding. Then, after a long day in the sun, Dinner on the Deck promises a seafood meal to remember with curry-marinated mussels, followed by grilled lobster with Southeast Asian dipping sauce. Or perhaps a last-minute Beyond Backyard Basics dinner is closer to what you had in mind? This little gem of a menu features ratatouille with penne-a heavenly jumble of roasted eggplants, onions, yellow squash, and red bell peppers, with plum tomatoes, garlic, thyme, parsley, and basil. For dessert, multicolored grapes perched atop pastry cream in puff pastry shells make a scrumptious and ever-so-pretty choice.So which menu will you try first? You'll find more than eighty pages of exquisite full-color photographs to help you decide. Altogether, this volume holds more than 350 recipes-including the very best recipes that appeared in Gourmet's food columns during 1999. There are hundreds of dishes that can be made in forty-five minutes or less (look for the clock symbol \u00f0); plenty of leaner and lighter selections (look for the feather symbol F); seasonal ideas for everything from apples to zucchini; and an impressive array of tempting sweets and snacks.This year's Cuisines of the World section turns to the intriguing flavors of Thailand with a traditional dinner for eight and a collection of Thai snacks. Dishes such as steamed red snapper with ginger, grilled beef salad, fish cakes, and coconut ice cream demonstrate the sweet, sour, hot, and salty tastes of this fascinating country. Informative primers and exquisite full-color photos add further insight.Twenty-four more brand-new recipes appear in a special section featuring Unusual Pastas and Grains. From fresh rice noodles to Israeli couscous to wheat berries, and much more, these unique pantry items will undoubtedly expand your palette of flavors.Just when you thought you had tasted it all, along comes a cookbook that opens up a world of new possibilities-The Best of Gourmet",

        "Description": "By the bestselling author of Must Love Dogs, the story of two grown-up sisters who fight like cats and dogs--but call each other at least twice a day When Must Love Dogs was published, the Chicago Tribune called it \"pitch-perfect\" and the Washington Post declared, \"Readers will hope that Claire Cook will be telling breezy summer stories from the South Shore of Massachusetts for seasons to come.\" Luckily for her legions of fans, Cook returns with another sparkling romantic comedy that's reminiscent of Must Love Dogs in all the right ways, but very much its own animal--about a relationship-challenged single woman, her quirky-to-put-it-mildly extended family, and the summer the shark movie came to town. Life's a bit of a beach these days for Ginger Walsh, who's single at forty-one and living back home in the family FROG (Finished Room Over Garage). She's hoping for a more fulfilling life as a sea glass artist, but instead is babysitting her sister's kids and sharing overnights with Noah, her sexy artist boyfriend with commitment issues and a dog Ginger's cat isn't too crazy about. Geri, her BlackBerry-obsessed sister, is also nearly over the deep end about her pending fiftieth birthday (and might just drag Ginger with her). Toss in a dumpster-picking father, a Kama Sutra T-shirt-wearing mother, a movie crew come to town with a very cute gaffer, an on-again-off-again glassblower boyfriend, plus a couple of Red Hat realtors, and hilarity ensues. The perfect summer read, Life's a Beach is a warm, witty, and wise look at what it takes to move forward at any stage in life.",

Upon his return to his native Budapest still clad in his striped prison clothes, fourteen-year-old George Koves senses the indifference, even hostility, of people on the street. His former neighbors and friends urge him to put the ordeal out of his mind, while a sympathetic journalist refers to the camps as \"the lowest circle of hell.\" The boy can relate to neither cliche and is left to ponder the meaning of his experience alone.George's response to his experience is curiously ambivalent. In the camps he tries to adjust to his ever-worsening situation by imputing human motives to his inhumane captors. By imposing his logic--that of a bright, sensitive, though in many ways ordinary teenager - he maintains a precarious semblance of normalcy. Once freed, he must contend with the \"banality of evil\" to which he has become accustomed: when asked why he uses words like \"naturally,\" \"undeniably,\" and \"without question\" to describe the most horrendous of experiences, he responds, \"In the concentration camp it was natural.\" Without emotional or spiritual ties to his Jewish heritage and rejected by his country, he ultimately comes to the conclusion that neither his Hungarianness nor his Jewishness was really at the heart of his fate: rather, there are only \"given situations, and within these, further givens.\"",

They signal the arrival of fresh air and sunshine after a long winter devoid of bare feet and box scores. The chance to see the game up close and personal, in beautiful slow motion. No other sport undergoes this slow, glorious unfolding. And no other book captures baseball's rite of passage in all its magic.Come on a wild ride through spring training's many attractions and peculiarities, from Florida to Arizona, the National to the American League, the dugouts to Section D. Glimpse retirees in Hawaiian shirts singing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game,\" million-dollar players taking it easy on the field and in the bars, young rookies flashing their skills, grizzled vets going through the motions, wide-eyed children dressed from head to toe in their favorite team's garb.It's all here, from Alligator Alley to Cactus Way, sit-ups to sunblock, home runs to hangovers -- a lively tribute to America's favorite pastime in its purest, most wonderful form.",

Maybe you've never heard of it until now and are asking, theology of the what? Maybe you're already familiar with the basics and are ready to incorporate this teaching on sex, love and marriage into your own life.     Whatever your level of understanding, you're probably ready for some good news about sex in a culture littered with the bad news of divorce, adultery, sexually transmitted disease, heartache and loneliness.     This guide is designed to help you appropriate the Pope's astonishing message: True, lasting love&#151;that which humanity enjoyed in the beginning, before the Fall&#151;is possible here and now. In nine straightforward lessons, Men and Women Are from Eden introduces the reader to the pope's warm, deeply biblical understanding of God's original plan for men and women, a plan that brings with it healing of mind in regard to sexuality and the body.",

        "Authors": "By McPherson, James M.",
        "Description": "James McPherson has emerged as one of America's finest historians. Battle Cry of Freedom, his Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the Civil War, was a national bestseller that Hugh Brogan, inThe New York Times Book Review, called \"history writing of the highest order.\" In that volume, McPherson gathered in the broad sweep of events, the political, social, and cultural forces at work during the Civil War era. Now, inAbraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution, he offers a series of thoughtful and engaging essays on aspects of Lincoln and the war that have rarely been discussed in depth.McPherson again displays his keen insight and sterling prose as he examines several critical themes in American history. He looks closely at the President's role as Commander-in-Chief of the Union forces, showing how Lincoln forged a national military strategy for victory. He explores the importance of Lincoln's great rhetorical skills, uncovering how--through parables and figurative language--he was uniquely able to communicate both the purpose of the war and a new meaning of liberty to the people of the North. In another section, McPherson examines the Civil War as a Second American Revolution, describing how the Republican Congress elected in 1860 passed an astonishing blitz of new laws (rivaling the first hundred days of the New Deal), and how the war not only destroyed the social structure of the old South, but radically altered the balance of power in America, ending 70 years of Southern power in the national government.The Civil War was the single most transforming and defining experience in American history, and Abraham Lincoln remains the most important figure in the pantheon of our mythology. These graceful essays, written by one of America's leading historians, offer fresh and unusual perspectives on both.",

But napalm, helicopters, and gunfire had become regular accompaniments to the monastic routine as the violence engulfing Algeria drew closer to the isolated cloister high in the Atlas Mountains.",

The man in white who emerges from the Sistine Chapel at its conclusion will automatically become one of the most important figures on earth, a leader who commands a unique combination of political and spiritual power. Depending on how he chooses to exercise that power, governments and political systems may rise or fall, religious wars may heat up or abate, and the Church may undergo a radical transformation\u2013from changes in its stances on such issues as sexuality, the place of women in the Church, to the role of the papacy itself.Conclave is a fascinating look at the election process and at what this headline-making occasion will mean to the world. John L. Allen, Jr., takes readers behind the scenes to reveal the issues, parties, and people most likely to determine the outcome. Setting the election within a broader context, he explains why it matters who becomes pope, discusses their role in the modern world, and examines the issues that will form the agenda of the next papacy.Although the book is not intended as a \u201chandicapper\u2019s guide,\u201d Allen does offer his own informed list of the \u201ctop twenty\u201d contenders for the position. He creates, as well, a classification system that clarifies the differences among the informal political parties that exist within the College of Cardinals, the body of 130-plus men who will elect John Paul II\u2019s successor. In conclusion, he presents a critical, independent-minded profile of each of those cardinals\u2013for one of them will certainly be the new pope.",

Doug began working at his grandfather's diner in Jamaica, Queens, when he was just ten years old\u2014barely big enough to haul a sack of potatoes. His next real restaurant job, following a brief stint in college and some time spent in Colorado kitchens, was in Huntington, Long Island, his hometown. Drivingly ambitious and hardworking, he would travel into Manhattan on his days off to work, often for twelve hours or more without pay, in some of New York\u2019s premiere restaurants.He eventually was offered a regular job at David Bouley's new restaurant, Bouley Bakery, where he worked six days a week with double shifts at one of New York\u2019s hottest and most acclaimed restaurants, often leaving the house before dawn and returning home to grab a couple of hours of sleep before taking the train back into the city. From there he went to Alain Ducasse New York, which eventually won four stars from theNew York Times. Doug caught Ducasse's eye and was selected as the first American chef in the Ducasse empire and the chef to lead the next Ducasse restaurant in New York, Mix. Running the kitchen of Mix was both a dream job and a formidable challenge. Doug guided the restaurant through many crises in the face of mounting pressure and tension from all sides\u2014before an explosive conclusion. After leaving Mix, Doug was offered a job working for Thomas Keller at the French Laundry, arguably America's restaurant mecca, where he helped lead the kitchen with Keller. Today, just past thirty, he is starting a whole new chapter in a remarkable career\u2014a seasoned chef at last.Filled with rampant egos, cutthroat kitchen politics, and settings ranging from Monte Carlo to Paris and Napa Valley,The Seasoning of a Chef is a real and rare glimpse into the food industry. More than anyone until now, Doug Psaltis reveals vividly and honestly the hardships, sacrifices, and dreams of glory that are all part of becoming a great chef.",

        "Description": "A Future Perfect is the first comprehensive examination of the most important revolution of our time--globalization--and how it will continue to change our lives. The authors, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, correspondents for The Economist, won the Financial Times/Booz Allen Hamilton Global Business Book Award on Strategy and Leadership for their previous collaboration, The Witch Doctors. In A Future Perfect, Micklethwait and Wooldridge expand their field of vision in order to analyze, demystify, and expose the global forces reshaping our world, and they detail both the challenge and the hidden promise those forces hold for individuals, businesses, and governments.Do businesses benefit from going global? Are we creating winner-take-all societies? Will globalization seal the triumph of junk culture? What will happen to individual careers? Gathering evidence from the shantytowns of S\u00e3o Paolo to the boardroom of General Electric, from the troubled Russia-Estonia border to the booming San Fernando Valley sex industry, Micklethwait and Wooldridge mount a powerful, witty, levelheaded defense of globalization. Along the way, the authors introduce us to the cosmocrats--the members of the elite business, information, and diplomatic class who are creating the new world order. They also identify the three engines of globalization and describe how people are managing and governing in an increasingly global era. As they did in The Witch Doctors, the authors also brilliantly puncture myths and conventional wisdom, separating false hopes from emerging realities.Incisive, expansive, and optimistic, A Future Perfect is an illuminating tour of the global economy and a fascinating assessment of its potential impact.",

Judith can't bear to part with the photograph of her mother in its lovely green silk frame.

But Uncle Geoffrey's house holds a secret of its own. And Judith's small picture frame, hidden away at the bottom of her trunk, unleashes a powerful force that seems determined to bring that secret into the open.

But then Gloria was his cousin, his beloved prima, and he has made a vow to her mother - and to himself - to find the killer.Neither flawless beauty nor marriage to a hot-shot politician had protected his cousin from a ghastly end.

Could her bodily disfigurement be linked to the cases of cattle mutilation plaguing the area?Aided by his loyal girlfriend, Rita, and spurred on by the susto, the spirit, of Gloria, Sonny's search for truth leads him straight into Albuquerque's treacherous political arena - and a passionate environmental battle over nuclear waste transport and disposal.",

        "Authors": "By Milne, A. A., Allen, Roger E., and Allen, Stephen D.",
        "Description": "Are you as confused as Pooh about success and how to achieve it? Only decades ago, the definition of \"success\" was fairly straightforward: \"the attainment of wealth, position, honors, and the like.\" For Pooh it is as simple as acquiring more honey; for Piglet, it's far more serious: avoiding dangerous Heffalumps. But in these far more complicated times, people - as well as certain treasured animals of a certain forest - have all sorts of different ideas on the subject.Whatever your notion of success is, this captivating book by the celebrated authors of Winnie-the-Pooh on Management and Winnie-the-Pooh on Problem Solving will help you attain your goals. In addition to Pooh and Piglet, here are Eeyore, Roo, and the other endearing denizens of A. A. Milne's Hundred Acre Wood trying to make the art of living - and working - successfully far less befuddling. From understanding your own abilities to setting sensible objectives to defining and implementing a game plan to getting started, Winnie-the-Pooh on Success gives you the tools you need to be successful at any endeavor you choose.Whether you're a corporate manager, an entrepreneur, a student, a homemaker, or newly retired, this illuminating book by successful management consultants Roger E. Allen and Stephen D. Allen offers a wise, clear-headed, and commonsensical approach to business - and to life. Complete with a practical, accessible, and easy-to-follow plan for achieving the success you know can be yours, along with genuine Ernest H. Shepard illustrations, Winnie-the-Pooh on Success will take the Bother out of attaining your Very Important dreams, and help you get the pots of honey you deserve.",

        "Title": "The Presumed Alliance: The Unspoken Conflict Between Latinos and Blacks and What It Means for America",
        "Authors": "By Vaca, Nicolas C.",
        "Description": "As Latinos and African Americans increasingly live side by side in large urban centers as well as in suburban clusters, the idealized concept of a \"rainbow coalition\" would suggest that these two disenfranchised groups are natural political allies. Such a notion would be based on the presumption of a commonality between the two groups that serves as the glue for forming political and economic alliances on a mass level. However, contrary to this theoretical approach stands evidence that few formal or even informal coalitions exist between Latinos and African Americans. Many political insiders are asking themselves in private how one might interpret the taboo yet very real subjectof the often-frayed relations between African Americans and Latinos. Many who do not address this divisive issue fear that to acknowledge such a rift would invite adversaries to cast tension as a political weakness.Indeed, as the number of Latinos has increased dramatically over the last ten years, competition over power and resources has led to antagonism and a failure to cooperate. Many African Americans now view Latinos, because of their growing numbers, as a threat to their social, economic, and political gains. Conversely, Latinos do not view African Americans as an oppressed group in the same way other Americans do, and this often has negative results.In The Presumed Alliance, Vaca examines the historical context as well as the contemporary manifestations of the conflicts between Latinos and African Americans in an engaging, informative manner. Using case studies from New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Washington, D.C., Compton, and Houston, Vaca illustrates just how contentious the two groups have been toward each other, and what issues are at the root of such discord. With its discussions of language barriers, competition over affirmative action, and the overlooked contributions of Hispanics during the American Civil Rights movement, Vaca's narrative is both eye-opening and well informed. By daring to raise a topic that may upset so many, Vaca believes the issues surrounding these sometimes strained relations also may be resolved, if only they are addressed. This thought-provoking topic invites all to stop and think about important questions, and offers a glimpse at the future makeup of the American political landscape.",

        "Title": "The Limits Of Privacy",
        "Authors": "By Etzioni, Amitai",
        "Description": "Privacy is perhaps the most hallowed of American rights\u2014and most people are concerned that new technologies available to governments and corporations threaten to erode this most privileged of rights. But in The Limits of Privacy, Amitai Etzioni offers a decidedly different point of view, in which the right to privacy is balanced against concern for public safety and health. Etzioni looks at five flashpoint issues: Megan\u2019s Laws, HIV testing of infants, deciphering of encrypted messages, national identification cards, and medical records, and concludes that there are times when Amricans\u2019 insistence on privacy is not in the best interests of society at large. He offers four clear and concise criteria which, when applied jointly, help us to determine when the right to privacy should be overridden for the greater public good.Almost every week headlines warn us that our cell phones are being monitored, our e-mails read, and our medical records traded on the open market. Public opinion polls show that Americans are dismayed about incursions against personal privacy. Congress and state legislatures are considering laws designed to address their concerns.Focusing on five flashpoint issues\u2014Megan\u2019s Law, mandatory HIV testing of infants, encryption of electronic documents, national identification cards and biometric identifiers, and medical records\u2014The Limits of Privacy argues counterintuitively that sometimes major public health and safety concerns should outweigh the individual\u2019s right to privacy. Presenting four concise criteria to determine when the right to privacy should be preserved and when it should be overridden in the interests of the wider community, Etzioni argues that, in some cases, we would do well to sacrifice the privacy of the individual in the name of the common good.",

        "Title": "The Race To The Bottom: Why A Worldwide Worker Surplus And Uncontrolled Free Trade Are Sinking American Living Standards",
        "Authors": "By Tonelson, Alan",
        "Description": "As evidenced by the WTO riots in Seattle in December 1999, there is a volatile debate among Americans over how the new world economy affects our standards of living and our country's chances for future prosperity. With giant multinational companies based in the U.S. and other wealthy countries transferring ever more factories and labs to poorer countries, the fear is that slave-wage workers overseas are undermining the bargaining power of labor in the industrialized world.In this book Alan Tonelson explains how a competition has emerged in which countries with the weakest workplace safety laws, the lowest taxes, and the toughest unionization laws win investment from American and European countries. Tonelson argues that this \"race to the bottom\" of labor standards has been the driving force behind the decline of American living standards for the past quarter century, and, as we have already begun to see, will cause even bigger problems for the worldwide economy as it continues.Tonelson analyzes how the entry of such population giants as China, India, and Brazil into the global market have added fuel to the eroding labor standards. He reveals how an ever larger share of the foreign competition faced by American laborers is hitting not just fields such as apparel and toys, but many of America's highest wage industries such as aerospace and software. And he describes how the reeducation and retraining programs that political leaders say is the remedy to the problem will do nothing to help most Americans cope with competition from the global workforce.A lively, provocative guide to the new global economy, The Race to the Bottom fills the gap of hard evidence in readable form in the globalization debate, providing the guidebook that American workers have been waiting for, and the indictment that our economic and policy establishments have been dreading.",
