        "Description": "An encounter at a party changed Gay Hendricks forever. A stranger asked him to imagine himself on his deathbed and to consider this question:?Was your life a complete success?\u201d If not, then ?What would be the things you\u2019d wish had happened that would have made it a success?\u201d Hendricks said his deepest wish was for a loving, lasting relationship with a woman. The stranger said, \"turn that wish into a goal, and put it in the present tense.\u201d On the spot, Hendricks came up with this goal, \"I enjoy a happy marriage with a woman I adore and who adores me. I enjoy a lifelong blossoming of passion and creativity with her.\" This goal helped him create his marriage to Kathlyn, the date he'd taken to the party, and during the past 27 years they've become well-known relationship experts and co-authors of 9 books together. This short, focused book shows readers how to discover their own five wishes for a fulfilled life (as well as to read the stories of all five of Hendricks's wishes). Neale Donald Walsch's thoughtful foreword explores the power of this approach and explains why he insisted Hendricks share it with others.",

        "Title": "Green Mansions: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Hudson, W. H. and Galsworthy, John (FRW)",
        "Description": "Lavishly illustrated with 60 drawings by Keith Henderson, W.H. Hudson\u2019s most famous novel, Green Mansions is the book that sparked the nature conservation movement. The inspiration for the movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Green Mansions stunningly recreates the untouched forests of South America with amazing detail.  After a failed revolution, Abel is forced to seek refuge in the virgin forests of southwestern Venezuela. There, in his \u201cgreen mansion\u201d, Abel meets the wood-nymph Rima, the last of a reclusive aboriginal race. The bird-girl\u2019s ethereal presence captivates him completely, but the love that blossoms is soon darkened by cruelty and sorrow. Exploring a love somewhere between reality and imagination, Green Mansions is a poignant meditation on the loss of wilderness, the dream of a return to nature and the bitter reality of the encounter between savage and civilized man.   A master of natural history writing, W.H. Hudson forms a link between nineteenth-century Romanticism and the twentieth-century ecological movement. First published in 1904, Green Mansions owes much of its success to the mystic, near-religious feelings that pervade the story. Hudson\u2019s halting, poetic expressions combined with his descriptions of untouched, natural beauty makes Green Mansions as powerful call back to nature today as it was one hundred years ago.",

As a sophomore at Brown University, he spent his days fitting right in with Brown's free-spirited, ultra-liberal student body. But when Roose leaves his Ivy League confines to spend a semester at Liberty University, a conservative Baptist school in Lynchburg, Virginia, obedience is no longer optional.Liberty is the late Reverend Jerry Falwell's \"Bible Boot Camp\" for young evangelicals, his training ground for the next generation of America's Religious Right. Liberty's ten thousand undergraduates take courses like Evangelism 101 and follow a forty-six-page code of conduct that regulates every aspect of their social lives. Hoping to connect with his evangelical peers, Roose decides to enroll at Liberty as a new transfer student, chronicling his adventures in this daring report from the front lines of America's culture war.His journey takes him from an evangelical hip-hop concert to a spring break mission trip to Daytona Beach (where he learns to preach the gospel to partying coeds). He meets pastors' kids, closet doubters, Christian rebels, and conducts what would be the last print interview of Rev. Falwell's life.",

        "Title": "Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes",
        "Authors": "By Robinson, Jancis",
        "Description": "Hailed by the Wine Advocate as \"perhaps the most gifted of all wine writers writing today,\" Jancis Robinson has been voted the Wine Writer's Wine Writer by her peers, dubbed \"the undisputed mistress of the kingdom of wines\" by France's Madame Figaro, and won the 1995 Wine Literary Award of the Wine Appreciation Guild. Holding the prestigious rank of Master of Wine, Robinson lectures and judges all over the world, and recently hosted a ten-part PBS series Jancis Robinson's Wine Course. She also edited The Oxford Companion to Wine, which won every major wine book award in 1995--including the Julia Child Cookbook Award (Wine, Beer, or Spirits) and The James Beard Book Award--and which has been praised by Frank Prial in The New York Times as \"easily the most complete compendium of wine knowledge assembled in modern times,\" and by Anthony Dias Blue as \"one of the definitive reference books on the subject.\"    Now, in Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes, Robinson provides wine aficionados with a handy, on-the-spot guide to the most central aspect of wine making--the grapes themselves. Here are over 850 grapes, ranging from such widely acclaimed vines as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Muscat, Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sauvignon Blanc, to economically important if less distinguished vines such as Airen, Grenache, Muller-Thurgau, Trebbiano, Syrah, and Rkatsiteli. Robinson offers a fact-filled introduction--discussing everything from rootstocks and wine blends, to vine pests and disease--and glossary of technical terms (from botrytis and carbonic maceration, to fanleaf and foxy, to skin, sugars, tannins, and yield). She then examines the world's grape varieties in alphabetical order, describing the basic characteristics of the wine produced by the grape (dry, sweet, high or low acidity, the bouquet), its likely quality, the regions that produce the best wine, and, if a blended wine, the blends that yield the best results. (As an added guide to the wine a grape might produce, the Guide includes an easy-to-use visual aid: a horizontal bar with a band which shows the range of quality, from ordinary to superb.) Robinson also shares much fascinating wine history, her deep insight into the wine industry, and more important, her own judgment on a wine. And Robinson does not hedge in judging a wine: discussing Carignan, France's most planted red wine, she comments \"Its wine is high in everything--acidity, tannins, color, bitterness--but flavor and charm. This gives it the double inconvenience of being unsuitable for early consumption yet unworthy of maturation.\" And for Trebbiano, the most planted white grape in Italy (and with Ugni Blanc, which is the name of the grape in France, the second most planted white grape in the world), Robinson notes \"the word Trebbiano in a wine name almost invariably signals something light, white, crisp, and uninspiring.\"        Perhaps most important, this portable book can be used in the store as a buying guide. With Robinson's Guide, simply find the grape variety on the label--or, if not listed, turn to Robinson's unique Grapes Behind the Names appendix in the back--look up the entry on that grape, and you will discover everything you need to know to make an informed decision to buy or pass.  With Jancis Robinson by your side, you can evaluate a bottle of wine on the spot, no matter where, when, or by whom it has been produced.",

        "Title": "Seven Attitude Adjustments for Finding a Loving Man",
        "Authors": "By Chapman, Audrey B.",
        "Description": "You know you're fine. Plus, you have a decent job, a nice place to live. You're smart and ambitious. So, where's your man?  Because you're so well pulled together and without a partner, you may have developed an attitude toward men. Believe it or not, men can sense what you think of them. For instance, when you meet a man do you evaluate him as a possible partner or do you think of him as a potential friend? If you become open to him as a friend you may learn something from him that will forever enrich your life. Or he may ultimately become your lifelong partner or introduce you to him. The key is openness, and you can't be receptive to love when an attitude creates a barrier around you.  Renowned relationship therapist Audrey B. Chapman identifies the subtle attitudes Black women harbor that prevent us from finding love and happiness. Without even knowing it we can be controlling, materialistic, cynical, desperate, and even hostile. Chapman shows us how to take time for ourselves -- to figure out the exact traits we're looking for in a man to enable relationships to become learning experiences, not jumping-off points for developing resentment. She tells us how to evaluate potential partners so that we don't repeat the same mistakes. She also offers insightful and refreshing tips on how to meet and marry the man of our dreams.",

        "Authors": "By Klare, Michael T.",
        "Description": "From the author of Resource Wars, a landmark assessment of the critical role of petroleum in America's actions abroad  In his pathbreaking Resource Wars, world security expert Michael T. Klare alerted us to the role of resources in conflicts in the post-Cold War world. Now, in Blood and Oil, he concentrates on a single precious commodity, petroleum, while issuing a warning to the United States-its most powerful, and most dependent, global consumer.  Since September 11th and the commencement of the \"war on terror,\" the world's attention has been focused on the relationship between U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and the oceans of crude oil that lie beneath the region's soil. Klare traces oil's impact on international affairs since World War II, revealing its influence on the Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Carter doctrines. He shows how America's own wells are drying up as our demand increases; by 2010, the United States will need to import 60 percent of its oil. And since most of this supply will have to come from chronically unstable, often violently anti-American zones-the Persian Gulf, the Caspian Sea, Latin America, and Africa-our dependency is bound to lead to recurrent military involvement.  With clarity and urgency, Blood and Oil delineates the United States' predicament and cautions that it is time to change our energy policies, before we spend the next decades paying for oil with blood.",
