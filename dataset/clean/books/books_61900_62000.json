        "Authors": "By White, Jonathan R.",
        "Description": "White's TERRORISM: AN INTRODUCTION, a perennial best-seller, is recognized as the most objective terrorism book in the market. In the latest edition, White has rewritten and incorporated parts of his two books DEFENDING THE HOMELAND and TERRORISM to create one new comprehensive text. To reflect this change, the title has been updated to TERRORISM AND HOMELAND SECURITY: AN INTRODUCTION, Fifth Edition.  TERRORISM AND HOMELAND SECURITY: AN INTRODUCTION, Fifth Edition strives to discuss the most sophisticated theories by the best terrorist analysts in the world, while still focusing on the domestic and international threats of terrorism and the basic security issues that surround terrorism today. The student-oriented writing style is complemented by rich pedagogy, and there is an adequate amount of research and theoretical discussion to make this the ideal text for both the undergraduate- and graduate-level courses.",

Bush came to invade Iraq--and how his administration struggled with the devastating fallout.Hubris connects the dots between Bush's expletive-laden outbursts at Saddam  Hussein, the bitter battles between the CIA and the White House, the  fights within the intelligence community over Saddam's supposed weapons  of mass destruction, the outing of an undercover CIA officer, and the  Bush administration's misleading sales campaign for war. Written by  veteran reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn, this is  an inside look at how a president took the nation to war using faulty  and fraudulent intelligence. It's a dramatic page-turner and an  intriguing account of conspiracy, backstabbing, bureaucratic ineptitude,  journalistic malfeasance, and arrogance.",

        "Title": "The War for Muslim Minds: Islam and the West",
        "Authors": "By Kepel, Gilles",
        "Description": "The events of September 11, 2001, forever changed the world as we knew it. In their wake, the quest for international order has prompted a reshuffling of global aims and priorities. In a fresh approach, Gilles Kepel focuses on the Middle East as a nexus of international disorder and decodes the complex language of war, propaganda, and terrorism that holds the region in its thrall.The breakdown of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in 2000 was the first turn in a downward spiral of violence and retribution. Meanwhile, a neo-conservative revolution in Washington unsettled U.S. Mideast policy, which traditionally rested on the twin pillars of Israeli security and access to Gulf oil. In Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, a transformation of the radical Islamist doctrine of Bin Laden and Zawahiri relocated the arena of terrorist action from Muslim lands to the West; Islamist radicals proclaimed jihad against their enemies worldwide.Kepel examines the impact of global terrorism and the ensuing military operations to stem its tide. He questions the United States' ability to address the Middle East challenge with Cold War rhetoric, while revealing the fault lines in terrorist ideology and tactics. Finally, he proposes the way out of the Middle East quagmire that triangulates the interests of Islamists, the West, and the Arab and Muslim ruling elites. Kepel delineates the conditions for the acceptance of Israel, for the democratization of Islamist and Arab societies, and for winning the minds and hearts of Muslims in the West.",

Her twenty-year relationship with their father. Her work translating the larger-than-life French intellectual and feminist Danielle Westerman. Her modest success with a novel of her own, and the clamour of her American publisher for a sequel.

One of the most important components of this community is the U.S. Army Intelligence Center. Its mission is to provide information to commanders at all levels in the U.S. Army so that they are able to determine the capabilities of a foreign foe or act quickly on accurate, up-to-date intelligence. Now for the first time ever, the recently declassified U.S. Army Counterintelligence Handbook provides a rare look into the specialized and secretive world of military intelligence and counterintelligence procedure.Counterintelligence comprises efforts to determine what the enemy knows, efforts to keep friendly intelligence secret, and efforts to hamper the enemy's ability to collect and use intelligence. In this manual, the first four chapters provide counterintelligence information to the commander and his staff, while the remaining chapters cover the nuts-and-bolts of counterintelligence operations.The book covers everything from conducting background investigations to using field artillery to destroy stations. There is general information, for instance, on evaluating assassination threats, contacting members of friendly resistance organizations, and how best to handle moles. There is advice on checking and keeping files, conducting searches, and the administration of lie detector tests. Also covered are the ethics, legalities, and practical concerns of placing bugs, tapping telephones, and setting up listening posts for wireless intercepts, as well as the use of cameras and recorders. There is also information on tracking and connecting members of groups or cells, with advice on creating diagrams to illustrate the relationship among targets.The U.S. Army Counterintelligence Handbook is a must-read for anyone with an interest in today's difficult military intelligence questions, and provides answers right from the source.",

The Sharper Your Knife, the Less You Cry is the funny and inspiring account of her struggle in a stew of hot-tempered, chefs, competitive classmates, her own \"wretchedly inadequate\" French - and how she mastered the basics of French cuisine. Filled with rich, sensual details of her time in the kitchen - the ingredients, cooking techniques, wine, and more than two dozen recipes - and the vibrant sights and sounds of the markets, shops, and avenues of Paris, it is also a journey of self-discovery, transformation, and, ultimately, love.",
