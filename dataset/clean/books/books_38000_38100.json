It's a game of skill, and playing well depends on more than just a good hand or the ability to hide emotion. The first step toward developing a style of play worthy of the greats is learning to think like a poker player. In a game where there are no absolutes, mastering the basics is only the beginning -- being able to pull off the strategy and theatrics is the difference between legendary wins and epic failure.",

Joni shows us precious jewels of biblical truth that lie scattered amidst the gravel of life\u2019s dusty road. \u201cThe book you hold in your hands is my treasure trove of diamond chips I\u2019ve collected over the years,\u201d says Joni. \u201cI\u2019ve carefully selected favorite gems, ones I\u2019ve often held to the light, turned this way and that to admire their beauty, diamonds that have made me rich in faith and wealthy in hope.\u201d These 366 meditations uncover a wealth of promise, of eternal truths waiting to transform the events of our lives into facets that catch and reflect God\u2019s glory. Written from the perspective of a woman who traverses life in a wheelchair, this book wipes away the surface grit of suffering and circumstances to reveal the radiant hope that each of us can claim. Diamonds in the Dust takes theology and gives it flesh, breath, and emotion. With eloquence, Joni draws from her own trials and triumphs to enrich us all with the wisdom of Scripture. But she\u2019s not the only one whose everyday life holds such potential. \u201cLook down at your feet,\u201d Joni writes. \u201cThe path sparkles. God has placed diamonds in the dust of your road too!\u201d",

        "Title": "Good-Enough Mother: The Perfectly Imperfect Book of Parenting",
        "Authors": "By Syler, Rene and Moline, Karen",
        "Description": "In an ideal world, mothers would have time to hand-sew their kids' costumes for the school play, prepare all-organic meals, and volunteer in the classroom at the drop of a hat. In reality, most moms have to settle for plopping their little ones in front of SpongeBob so that they can prepare yet another chicken nugget-based dinner, guiltily convinced they're falling down on the job.In Good-Enough Mother, Ren\u00e9 Syler pulls back the curtain to reveal the truth about modern mothering and reassure time-stressed moms that even if their children are strangers to made-from-scratch cookies, they can emerge as happy, well-adjusted, fully functioning members of society. Mother to two great kids of her own, Syler explains how she learned to chuck perfection for practicality -- in short, how she became a Good-Enough Mother. She shows other women seeking to balance family, work, and some semblance of a personal life how to happily join the ranks of Good-Enough Mothers, who occasionally serve breakfast for dinner yet give their children plenty of what really matters -- love, time, and support.Each essay provides welcome empathy and sage advice on navigating life's different obstacles, whether it's dealing with annoying Supermoms, bluffing through a third grader's math homework, or coping with the words that strike terror into every parent's heart (\"Your son's teacher on line one\"). Offering real wisdom tempered with humor and warmth, Good-Enough Mother will have every modern mom laughing in relief and recognition.",

        "Title": "Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software",
        "Authors": "By Johnson, Steven",
        "Description": "This book is about the mystery of why the whole is sometimes smarter than the sum of its parts.  Emergence is what happens when an interconnected system of relatively simple elements self-organizes to form more intelligent, more adaptive higher-level behavior. It's a bottom-up model; rather than being engineered by a general or a master planner, emergence begins at the ground level. Systems that at first glance seem vastly different -- ant colonies, human brains, cities, immune systems -- all turn out to follow the rules of emergence. In each of these systems, agents residing on one scale start producing behavior that lies a scale above them: ants create colonies, urbanites create neighborhoods.  In the tradition of Being Digital and The Tipping Point, Steven Johnson, acclaimed as a \"cultural critic with a poet's heart\" (The Village Voice), takes readers on an eye-opening intellectual journey from the discovery of emergence to its applications. He introduces us to our everyday surroundings, offering suprising examples of feedback, self-organization, and adaptive learning. How does a lively neighborhood evolve out of a disconnected association of shopkeepers, bartenders, and real estate developers? How does a media event take on a life of its own? How will new software programs create an intelligent World Wide Web?  Drawing upon evolutionary theory, urban studies, neuroscience, and computer games, Emergence is a guidebook to one of the key components of twenty-first-century culture. Until recently, Johnson explains, the disparate philosophers of emergence have worked to interpret the world. But today they are starting to change it. This book is the riveting story of that change and what it means for the future. If you've searched for information on the Web, played a recent video game, or accepted a collect call using voice recognition software, you've already encountered the new world of artificial emergence. Provocative, engaging, and sophisticated, Emergence puts you on the front lines of a sweeping revolution in science and thought.",

        "Description": "By being too timid and too weak, too hesitant and too confused, Democrats have allowed Republicans to run amok.Republicans today control everything: the White House, the Congress, the Supreme Court, the federal bureaucracy, the military, and the corporate special interests and their lobbyists. They operate powerful right-wing organizations, right-wing think tanks, and a conservative media that serves as an attack dog against Democrats.Republicans have used their absolute power to corrupt our democracy, degrade our military, weaken our health care system, diminish our stature in the world, damage our environment, reward the rich, hammer the poor, squeeze the middle class, bankrupt our Treasury, and indenture our children to foreign debt holders.In this important book, James Carville and Paul Begala show Democrats how they can take it back. They offer a clear-eyed critique of their party's failures and make specific, concrete recommendations on how Democrats can avoid losing elections on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, gay rights, and moral values and start winning them on health care, political reform, energy, the environment, tax reform, and more.Carville and Begala say that liberal Democrats are right that too many establishment Democrats kowtow to corporate interests and shamefully supported George W. Bush's rush to war. And moderate Democrats are right to complain that too many Democrats are out of step with middle-class values, too removed from people of faith, too enthralled with intellectual and cultural elites.But the problem with the Democrats, Carville and Begala argue, is not ideological. It's anatomical. They lack a backbone. Take It Back is a spinal transplant for Democrats and an audacious battle plan for victory.",

She vividly describes the isolation of Eva's rebellious and lonely English mother; the desperation of her Afrikaner father as drought destroys his farm; the conflicts among the black farmworkers as the younger generation questions the loyalty and subservience of their elders; and the dangerous silence of a young girl who witnesses too much.Like Nadine Gordimer and J. M. Coetzee, Fugard has written a profoundly moving family drama, subtly set against the backdrop of a country in turmoil. She moves with extraordinary agility between intimate and revelatory domestic scenes and the fiercely challenging land. This is a powerful story from a stunning new writer.",

        "Title": "Theodore Rex",
        "Authors": "By Morris, Edmund",
        "Description": "The most eagerly awaited presidential biography in years, Theodore Rex is a sequel to Edmund Morris\u2019s classic bestseller The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. It begins by following the new President (still the youngest in American history) as he comes down from Mount Marcy, New York, to take his emergency oath of office in Buffalo, one hundred years ago. A detailed prologue describes TR\u2019s assumption of power and journey to Washington, with the assassinated President McKinley riding behind him like a ghost of the nineteenth century. (Trains rumble throughout this irresistibly moving narrative, as TR crosses and recrosses the nation.) Traveling south through a succession of haunting landscapes, TR encounters harbingers of all the major issues of the new century-Imperialism, Industrialism, Conservation, Immigration, Labor, Race-plus the overall challenge that intimidated McKinley: how to harness America\u2019s new power as the world\u2019s richest nation. Theodore Rex (the title is taken from a quip by Henry James) tells the story of the following seven and a half years-years in which TR entertains, infuriates, amuses, strong-arms, and seduces the body politic into a state of almost total subservience to his will. It is not always a pretty story: one of the revelations here is that TR was hated and feared by a substantial minority of his fellow citizens. Wall Street, the white South, Western lumber barons, even his own Republican leadership in Congress strive to harness his steadily increasing power.Within weeks of arrival in Washington, TR causes a nationwide sensation by becoming the first President to invite a black man to dinner in the White House. Next, he launches his famous prosecution of the Northern Securities Company, and follows up with landmark antitrust legislation. He liberates Cuba, determines the route of the Panama Canal, mediates the great Anthracite Strike, and resolves the Venezuela Crisis of 1902-1903 with such masterful secrecy that the world at large is unaware how near the United States and Germany have come to war.During an epic national tour in the spring of 1903, TR\u2019s conservation philosophy (his single greatest gift to posterity) comes into full flower. He also bestows on countless Americans the richness of a personality without parallel-evangelical and passionate, yet lusty and funny; adroitly political, winningly natural, intellectually overwhelming. The most famous father of his time, he is adored by his six children (although beautiful, willful \u201cPrincess\u201d Alice rebelled against him) and accepted as an honorary member of the White House Gang of seditious small boys. Theodore Rex, full of cinematic detail, moves with the exhilarating pace of a novel, yet it rides on a granite base of scholarship. TR\u2019s own voice is constantly heard, as the President was a gifted letter writer and raconteur. Also heard are the many witticisms, sometimes mocking, yet always affectionate, of such Roosevelt intimates as Henry Adams, John Hay, and Elihu Root. (\u201cTheodore is never sober,\u201d said Adams, \u201conly he is drunk with himself and not with rum.\u201d)TR\u2019s speed of thought and action, and his total command of all aspects of presidential leadership, from bureaucratic subterfuge to manipulation of the press, make him all but invincible in 1904, when he wins a second term by a historic landslide. Surprisingly, this victory transforms him from a patrician conservative to a progressive, responsible between 1905 and 1908 for a raft of enlightened legislation, including the Pure Food and Employer Liability acts. Even more surprising, to critics who have caricatured TR as a swinger of the Big Stick, is his emergence as a diplomat. He wins the Nobel Peace Prize for bringing about an end to the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. Interspersed with many stories of Rooseveltian triumphs are some bitter episodes-notably a devastating lynching-that remind us of America\u2019s deep prejudices and fears. Theodore Rex does not attempt to justify TR\u2019s notorious action following the Brownsville Incident of 1906-his worst mistake as President-but neither does this resolutely honest biography indulge in the easy wisdom of hindsight. It is written throughout in real time, reflecting the world as TR saw it. By the final chapter, as the great \u201cTeddy\u201d prepares to quit the White House in 1909, it will be a hard-hearted reader who does not share the sentiment of Henry Adams: \u201cThe old house will seem dull and sad when my Theodore has gone.\u201d",

This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship, and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.",

Her wedding is in seven days.Regan Reilly and her fiance, Jack \"no relation\" Reilly - head of the NYPD Major Case Squad - are getting married. Regan had the perfect dress made by two young designers on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Arriving at the bridal salon to pick up her gown, Regan discovers the shop has been broken into, the designers bound and gagged, and wedding dresses for four of the April brides (her dress included) are missing.

The robber, nicknamed \"The Drip\" by the NYPD because he always strikes during rainstorms, has been eluding the police for months. Jack is determined to crack the case before his upcoming nuptials.Carol Higgins Clark fuses the two seemingly unrelated mysteries with a twist, taking readers from the streets of New York City, to the casinos of Altantic City, and finally to that most popular wedding spot - the one and only Las Vegas. She weaves a web of mystery around a tale of five April brides and the trials and tribulations they face planning their weddings.",

Sadly, when women grow up, they are often swept up into a life filled merely with duty and demands. Many Christian women are tired, struggling under the weight of the pressure to be a \"good servant,\" a nurturing caregiver, or a capable home manager.What Wild at Heart did for men, Captivating is doing for women. Setting their hearts free. This groundbreaking book shows readers the glorious design of women before the fall, describes how the feminine heart can be restored, and casts a vision for the power, freedom, and beauty of a woman released to be all she was meant to be. By revealing the core desires every woman shares-to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a grand adventure, and to unveil beauty-John and Stasi Eldredge invite women to recover their feminine hearts, created in the image of an intimate and passionate God. Further, they encourage men to discover the secret of a woman's soul and to delight in the beauty and strength women were created to offer.",

        "Title": "Zipporah, Wife of Moses: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Halter, Marek",
        "Description": "In the time of the Pharaoh, a tiny infant is rescued from the banks of the Red Sea. She is named Zipporah, \u201cthe little bird.\u201d  Although she is a Cushite by birth\u2014one of the black people of the lands to the south\u2014she is taken in by Jethro, high priest and sage of the Midianites. Jethro adores his adopted daughter, and she is an honored member of his family. But the blackness of Zipporah\u2019s skin sets her apart and will decide her future: she will be an outsider, and the men of her adopted tribe will not want her as a wife.  But when she becomes a young woman, Zipporah\u2019s destiny changes forever. While drawing water at a well one day, she meets a handsome young man, a stranger. Like her, he is an outsider, a foreigner. His name is Moses. A Hebrew raised in the house of the Pharaoh, Moses is a fugitive, forced to flee his homeland of Egypt after murdering one of the Pharaoh\u2019s cruel overseers. Zipporah knows almost immediately that this man will be the husband and partner she never thought she would have.At first Moses wants nothing more than a peaceful life with the Midianites. He is content in his role as Zipporah\u2019s lover and the honorary son of Jethro the sage. But Zipporah refuses to let Moses forget his past or turn away from what she believes to be his true destiny. Although he is the love of her life and the father of her children, Zipporah won\u2019t marry Moses until he agrees to return to Egypt to confront Pharaoh and free his people. When God reveals himself to Moses in the burning bush, his words echo Zipporah\u2019s, and Moses returns to Egypt with Zipporah by his side. A passionate lover and a generous, thoughtful wife, Zipporah becomes the guiding force in Moses\u2019 struggle. With the help of her powerful father, she teaches the rebellious young man about the rule of law and the force of justice. Because of Zipporah\u2014the outsider, the black-skinned woman\u2014Moses becomes a defender of the oppressed and a liberator of the enslaved. A woman ahead of her time, Zipporah leaps from the pages of this remarkable novel.  Bold, independent, and a true survivor, she is a captivating heroine, and her world of deserts, temples, and ancient wonders is a fitting backdrop to an epic tale.As Zipporah and Moses came closer to the queen of cities, the road parted company with the riverbank, and they found themselves facing a vast expanse of palm groves between the river and the hills and ocher cliffs, beyond which the desert began. And there, finally, rising into the blue sky, were the temples of Pharaoh.There were about ten of them, the largest surrounded by smaller ones, as if they had given birth to them. Seeming to grow out of the rock, the tops reaching up into the sky, they defied belief, so fantastically huge that beside them, even the cliffs seemed mere hillocks. Their faces shimmered in the heat like oil against the transparent sky. The neatly laid brick road leading to them burned in the sun.Zipporah remembered Moses\u2019 words about the splendor of Pharaoh\u2019s temples, but their hugeness surpassed anything she could have imagined. Nothing here was on a human scale. Not even the stone monsters with the heads of men and the bodies of lions that stood guard before them.Farther on, beneath great pyramids, they could see vast building sites. Colonnades and needles of white limestone and walls carved and painted with thousands of figures rose on the fronts of palaces hollowed out of the cliffs. There were unfinished monsters without wings, and statues without heads. In places, the roads became mere dirt paths, with bricks piled at the sides. And everywhere, the slaves swarmed, working, carrying, hammering, creating a din that rose into the heat of the day and was carried on the air from the farthest reaches of the building sites. \u2014FROM ZIPPORAHLook for the Reader\u2019s Group Guide at the back of this book.",

        "Authors": "By Foreman, George and Kellinger, Kathryn",
        "Description": "From George Foreman, two-time heavy-weight champion of the world and one of the greatest salesmen of all time, his cookbook written specifically for his fabulous, indoor grills.From dorm rooms and first apartments to suburban homes and four-star restaurants, the George Foreman grill is one of America's most popular small kitchen appliances. As a world-class athlete and father of ten, George Foreman is focused on fresh, healthy foods that keep him and his family strong. Between kids, careers, and a heavyweight training schedule, the Foremans are a big, constantly-in-motion family. Getting dinner on the table could be an endurance event, but instead of going ten rounds in the kitchen, George Foreman has perfected fast and easy, and he passes on his strategy in George Foreman's Indoor Grilling Made Easy. Here are more than 100 recipes that speak to the reason everyone buys the indoor grill in the first place: easy dishes filled with big, bold flavor for healthy food fast. From breakfast foods to snacks, entr\u00e9es, side dishes, and even desserts made on the grill, this is food to satisfy the young, the not-so-young, and everyone in between. Most recipes are naturally lower in carbohydrates (after all, George is a carnivore of some note), but some have choice carbs to fuel heavy training days. In addition to the recipes, there are plenty of flavor-enhancing ideas\u2014marinades, spice rubs, and sauces\u2014for simple cuts of fish, beef, pork, and chicken. You'll also find insider info on how to make perfect grilled veggies every time. George Foreman's Indoor Grilling Made Easy even includes finger foods for a party and a Thanksgiving dinner made on the grill. Portions feed a family of four but can easily be downsized for those living on their own (or doubled for Foreman-sized families).",

        "Title": "The Winds of Change: Climate, Weather, and the Destruction of Civilizations",
        "Authors": "By Linden, Eugene",
        "Description": "The Winds of Change places the horrifying carnage unleashed on New Orleans, Mississippi, and Alabama by Hurricane Katrina in context.Climate has been humanity's constant, if moody, companion. At times benefactor or tormentor, climate nurtured the first stirrings of civilization and then repeatedly visited ruin on empires and peoples. Eugene Linden reveals a recurring pattern in which civilizations become prosperous and complacent during good weather, only to collapse when climate changes -- either through its direct effects, such as floods or drought, or indirect consequences, such as disease, blight, and civil disorder.The science of climate change is still young, and the interactions of climate with other historical forces are much debated, but the evidence mounts that climate loomed over the fate of societies from arctic Greenland to the Fertile Crescent and from the lost cities of the Mayans in Central America to the rain forests of Central Africa. Taking into account the uncertainties in both science and the historical record, Linden explores the evidence indicating that climate has been a serial killer of civilizations. The Winds of Change looks at the present and then to the future to determine whether the accused killer is on the prowl, and what it will do in the future.The tragedy of New Orleans is but the latest instance in which a region prepared for weather disasters experienced in the past finds itself helpless when nature ups the ante. In the closing chapters, Linden explores why warnings about the dangers of climate change have gone unheeded and what is happening with climate today, and he offers perhaps the most explicit look yet at what a haywire climate might do to us. He shows how even a society prepared to absorb such threshold-crossing events as Katrina, the killer heat wave in Europe in 2003, or the floods in the American Midwest in the 1990s can spiral into precipitous decline should such events intensify and become more frequent.The Winds of Change places climate change, global warming, and the resulting instability in historical context and sounds an urgent warning for the future.",

And something extra-ordinary is about to happen to her.    Oh, it's not the very cute kitten that appears out of nowhere and demands to go home with her. It's not the sudden arrival of her cousin Zee, who believes he's the cause of a mysterious sickness that has struck his friends back in England. It's not her creepy English teacher Mr. Metos, who takes his mythology lessons just a little too seriously. And it's not the white-faced, yellow-eyed men in tuxedoes, who follow Charlotte everywhere.   What's so extraordinary is not any one of these things....It's all of them. And when Charlotte's friends start to get sick one by one, Charlotte and Zee set out to find a cure. Their quest leads them to a not-so-mythical Underworld, where they face rhyme-loving Harpies, gods with personnel problems, and ghosts with a thirst for blood.   Charlotte and Zee learn that in a world overrun by Nightmares, Pain, and Death, the really dangerous character is a guy named Phil. And then they discover that the fate of every person -- living and dead -- is in their young hands.

        "Description": "In First, Break All the Rules, Gallup presents the remarkable findings of its massive in-depth study of great managers\u2014those who excelled at turning each employee\u2019s talent into performance.The world\u2019s greatest managers differ in sex, age, and race. They employ different styles and focus on different goals. Despite their differences, great managers share one trait: They break virtually every rule conventional wisdom holds sacred. They don\u2019t believe that, with enough training, a person can achieve anything he sets his mind to. They don\u2019t try to help people overcome their weaknesses. They disregard the golden rule. They even play favorites.Companies compete to find and keep the best employees using pay, benefits, promotions, and training. But these well-intentioned efforts often miss the mark. The front-line manager is the key to attracting and retaining talented employees. This amazing book explains how the best managers select employees for talent rather than for skills or experience, how they set expectations, how they motivate people, and how they develop people.Gallup\u2019s research\u2014based on 80,000 managers in 400 companies\u2014produced twelve simple questions that distinguish the strongest departments of a company from the rest.First, Break All the Rules introduces this essential measuring stick and proves the link between employee opinions and productivity, profit, customer satisfaction, and rate of turnover.",

        "Authors": "By Bark, Sandra (EDT)",
        "Description": "Finally, the perfect graduation gift!   Take This Advice delivers thirty of the most powerful commencement speeches given in the past ten years. With grace and humor, this generation's favorite writers, performers, and thinkers address graduates to celebrate their greatest achievement, and to let them know that life after school is not, as many suspect, the end of the world.  Graduates will appreciate the mix of poignancy and irreverence in these timeless messages from speakers such as Will Ferrell, Bill Cosby, Seamus Heaney, Dennis Lehane, Toni Morrison, Robert Pinsky, Gloria Steinem, Sting, and many others.  Actors, comedians, and authors (or in Al Franken's case, all of the above) offer levity when we need it most. Franken says, \"For some reason, commencement speakers, almost all of whom have been selected because of their notable achievements, love to warn about the fraudulence of success. This spring countless graduates of other universities have been told, 'It's lonely at the top.' It's not. Believe me. It's much, much lonelier at the bottom.\"  Whether it's President George W. Bush offering hope -- \"And to the C students, I say: You, too, can be president of the United States\" -- or former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright calling for a government that \"understands that international economic and social progress depends on respect for women and women's rights,\" there is something for readers of any political persuasion.   Internationally renowned novelist Salman Rushdie describes a world in which people often find themselves tempted by deities of all sorts -- finance, convention, and custom -- and he inspires us to defy those gods, to stand up for what we believe and do what is in our hearts, no matter the risk.   In Take This Advice, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Frank McCourt, a living embodiment of the American dream, quotes Oscar Wilde: \"The best thing to do with advice is to give it to someone else....\"   You know a graduate -- what are you waiting for?",

In fact, Beppe would prefer if you left behind the baggage his crafty and elegant countrymen have smuggled into your subconscious. To get to his Italia, you\u2019ll need to forget about your idealized notions of Italy. Although La Bella Figura will take you to legendary cities and scenic regions, your real destinations are the places where Italians are at their best, worst, and most authentic: The highway: in America, a red light has only one possible interpretation\u2014Stop! An Italian red light doesn\u2019t warn or order you as much as provide an invitation for reflection. The airport: where Italians prove that one of their virtues (an appreciation for beauty) is really a vice. Who cares if the beautiful girls hawking cell phones in airport kiosks stick you with an outdated model? That\u2019s the price of gazing upon perfection.The small town: which demonstrates the Italian genius for pleasant living: \u201ca congenial barber . . . a well-stocked newsstand . . . professionally made coffee and a proper pizza; bell towers we can recognize in the distance, and people with a kind word and a smile for everyone.\u201dThe chaos of the roads, the anarchy of the office, the theatrical spirit of the hypermarkets, and garrulous train journeys; the sensory reassurance of a church and the importance of the beach; the solitude of the soccer stadium and the crowded Italian bedroom; the vertical fixations of the apartment building and the horizontal democracy of the eat-in kitchen. As you venture to these and many other locations rooted in the Italian psyche, you realize that Beppe has become your Dante and shown you a country that \u201chas too much style to be hell\u201d but is \u201ctoo disorderly to be heaven.\u201d Ten days, thirty places. From north to south. From food to politics. From saintliness to sexuality. This ironic, methodical, and sentimental examination will help you understand why Italy\u2014as Beppe says\u2014\u201ccan have you fuming and then purring in the space of a hundred meters or ten minutes.\u201d",

Out there on the high plains, among the Sioux reservations and the silent buttes, among the small towns dying and the people with them, you can hear the wind. And on the back of the wind is the sound of an old accordion\u2014tangos\u2014mingling with the lonely thump of a single drum in the nighttime and a far-off warrior\u2019s cry. On the back of the wind is the smell of worn saddle leather and sawdust, of sandalwood, and smoke from ancient ceremonial fires. To this, to a town called Salamander, comes Carlisle McMillan, a traveler and master carpenter seeking a place of quiet amid the grinding roar of progress. Near Wolf Butte, a strange and apparently haunted monolith, he finds his quiet, or so he believes, and begins rebuilding a decrepit house as a tribute to the gruff old man who taught him a carpenter\u2019s skills, rebuilding his life at the same time.He finds two very different, independent women: Gally Deveraux, who works at a diner in Salamander and longs for something more than she is, and Susanna Benteen, beautiful and enigmatic, who was drawn to Salamander for mysterious reasons of her own, a woman the town has labeled a witch. The women and his carpenter\u2019s trade and an old Indian known as Flute Player bring Carlisle a sense of contentment for a while. But his quiet is shattered as bulldozer treads begin to turn and the Yerkes County War commences. Run or stand your ground, that is Carlisle\u2019s dilemma, Gally on one side, Susanna on the other.Robert James Waller\u2019s fully imagined characters become people we know and care for deeply.High Plains Tango is the hauntingly lyrical story of a small town in the middle of nowhere, a town that forever changed\u2014and was forever changed by\u2014one man.",

The fate of entire platoons rests on her keen sense of smell. She's a Big Deal, and she likes it that way. Sometimes Cracker remembers when she was younger, and her previous owner would feed her hot dogs and let her sleep in his bed. That was nice, too.   Rick Hanski is headed to Vietnam. There, he's going to whip the world and prove to his family and his sergeant -- and everyone else who didn't think he was cut out for war -- wrong. But sometimes Rick can't help but wonder that maybe everyone else is right. Maybe he should have just stayed at home and worked in his dad's hardware store.   When Cracker is paired with Rick, she isn't so sure about this new owner. He's going to have to prove himself to her before she's going to prove herself to him. They need to be friends before they can be a team, and they have to be a team if they want to get home alive.   Told in part through the uncanny point of view of a German shepherd, Cracker! is an action-packed glimpse into the Vietnam War as seen through the eyes of a dog and her handler. It's an utterly unique powerhouse of a book by the Newbery Medal-winning author of Kira-Kira.",

It is also where some of democracy&#39;s greatest virtues clash with its worst vices: idealism and compromise meet corruption and bitter partisanship. The American Congress unveils the rich and varied history of this singular institution. Julian E. Zelizer has gathered together forty essays by renowned historians to capture the full drama, landmark legislation, and most memorable personalities of Congress. Organized around four major periods of congressional history, from the signing of the Constitution to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, this volume brings a fresh perspective to familiar watershed events: the Civil War, Watergate, the Vietnam War. It also gives a behind-the-scenes look at lesser-known legislation debated on the House and Senate floors, such as westward expansion and war powers control. Here are the stories behind the 1868 vote to impeach President Andrew Johnson; the rise of Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to Congress and a leading advocate for pacifism; and the controversy surrounding James Eastland of Mississippi, who carried civil rights bills in his pockets so they could not come up for a vote. Sidebars further spotlight notables including Huey Long, Sam Rayburn, and Tip O&#39;Neill, bringing the sweeping history of our lawmaking bodies into sharp focus. If you&#39;ve ever wondered how Congress worked in the past or what our elected officials do today, this book gives the engaging, often surprising, answers.",

        "Description": "Foreign correspondent Neely Tucker and his wife, Vita, arrived in Zimbabwe in 1997. After witnessing firsthand the devastating consequences of AIDS on the population, especially the children, the couple started volunteering at an orphanage that was desperately underfunded and short-staffed. One afternoon, a critically ill infant was brought to the orphanage from a village outside the city. She\u2019d been left to die in a field on the day she was born, abandoned in the tall brown grass that covers the highlands of Zimbabwe in the dry season. After a near-death hospital stay, and under strict doctor\u2019s orders, the ailing child was entrusted to the care of Tucker and Vita. Within weeks Chipo, the girl-child whose name means gift, would come to mean everything to them. Still an active correspondent, Tucker crisscrossed the continent, filing stories about the uprisings in the Congo, the civil war in Sierra Leone, and the postgenocidal conflict in Rwanda. He witnessed heartbreaking scenes of devastation and violence, steeling him further to take a personal role in helping anywhere he could. At home in Harare, Vita was nursing Chipo back to health. Soon she and Tucker decided to alter their lives forever\u2014they would adopt Chipo. That decision challenged an unspoken social norm\u2014that foreigners should never adopt Zimbabwean children. Raised in rural Mississippi in the sixties and seventies, Tucker was familiar with the mores associated with and dictated by race. His wife, a savvy black woman whose father escaped the Jim Crow South for a new life in the industrial North, would not be deterred in her resolve to welcome Chipo into their loving family. As if their situation wasn\u2019t tenuous enough, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was stirring up national fervor against foreigners, especially journalists, abroad and at home. At its peak, his antagonizing branded all foreign journalists personae non grata. For Tucker, the only full-time American correspondent in Zimbabwe, the declaration was a direct threat to his life and his wife\u2019s safety, and an ultimatum to their decision to adopt the child who had already become their only daughter. Against a background of war, terrorism, disease, and unbearable uncertainty about the future, Chipo\u2019s story emerges as an inspiring testament to the miracles that love\u2014and dogged determination\u2014can sometimes achieve. Gripping, heartbreaking, and triumphant, this family memoir will resonate throughout the ages.",

Dutch's reluctance to let her go isn't Lilly's only obstacle. As she's trying to outrun a snowstorm, her car skids on the icy road and strikes a man who emerges from the woods on foot. She recognizes the injured man as Ben Tierney, whom she'd met the previous summer. They're forced to wait out the storm in the cabin, but as the hours of their confinement mount, Lilly begins to wonder if the greatest danger to her safety isn't the blizzard outside, but the mysterious man right beside her.Is Ben Tierney the feared abductor? Or is he who he claims to be...her rescuer from harm and from the tragedy that haunts her?The compelling characters, sexual tension, and stunning plot twists in Sandra Brown's Chill Factor combine to create a page-turner that will keep readers guessing until the very end.",

        "Description": "\"The idea occurs to me, as so many desperate resolutions do, during the holiday season. I have maxed out the Visa, moved on to the Citibank debit card, and am tapping the ATM like an Iraqi guerrilla pulling crude from the pipeline. Convinced I am picking up no more than the occasional trinket...this atheist Grinch has managed to scatter $1,001 across New York City and the World Wide Web.\"And so, disgusted with the commerce in everything from pet cloning to patriotism, panicked over the fate of her finances and that of the trash-strewn earth, Judith Levine enlists her partner, Paul, in a radical experiment: to forgo all but the most necessary purchases for an entire year. Without consumer goods and experiences, Judith and Paul pursue their careers, nurture relationships, and try to keep their sanity, their identities, and their sense of humor intact. Tracking their progress -- and inevitable lapses -- Levine contemplates need and desire, scarcity and security, consumerism and citizenship. She asks the Big Questions: Can the economy survive without shopping? Are Q-tips necessary?Not Buying It is no primer on the simple life and how to live it. It's the confessions of a woman any reader can identify with: someone who can't live without French roast coffee or SmartWool socks but who has had it up to here with overconsumption and its effects on the earth and everyone who dwells there.The book will have readers discussing how and why they, too, might survive without shopping. For the humor and intelligence of its insights, the refreshment of its skepticism, and the surprises of its conclusions, Not Buying It is sure to be on anyone's list of Necessities.",

        "Description": "History has seen only a few women so magical, so evanescent, that they captured the spirit and imagination of their times. Diana, Princess of Wales and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis were two of these rare creatures.  They were the most famous women of the twentieth century ~ admired, respected, even adored at times; rebuked, mocked and reviled at others. Separated by nationality and a generation apart, they led two surprisingly similar lives.Both were the daughters of acrimonious divorce.  Both wed men twelve years their senior, men who needed \"trophy brides\" to advance their careers. Both married into powerful and domineering families, who tried, unsuccessfully, to tame their willful independence.  Both inherited power through marriage and both rebelled within their official roles, forever crushing the archetype.  And both revolutionized dynasties.And yet in many ways they were completely different: Jackie lived her life with an English \"stiff upper lip\" ~ never complaining, never explaining in the face of immense public curiosity. Diana lived her life with an American \"quivering lower lip\" ~ with televised tell-alls, exposing her family drama to a world eager for every detail.These two lives have been well documented but never before compared. And never before examined in the context of their times. Jay Mulvaney, author of Kennedy Weddings and Jackie: The Clothes of Camelot, probes the lives of these two twentieth century icons and discovers: The nature of their personalities forged from the cradle by their relationships with their fathers, Black Jack Bouvier and Johnny Spencer.\u00b7Their early years, and their early relationships with men.\u00b7Their marriages, and the truth behind the lies, the betrayals and the arrangements.\u00b7Their greatest achievements: motherhood.\u00b7Their prickly relationships with their august mothers-in-law, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy and Queen Elizabeth II\u00b7 Their lives as single women, working mothers.\u00b7 Their roles as icons and archetypes.Graced with never before seen photographs from many private collections, and painstakingly researched, 0Diana and Jackie presents these two remarkable and unique women as they have never been seen before.",

        "Description": "Do you want to get ahead in life? Climb the ladder to personal success? The secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships\u2014so that everyone wins.In Never Eat Alone, Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps\u2014and inner mindset\u2014he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him.The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington\u2019s corridors of power to Hollywood\u2019s A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain\u2019s 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum.Ferrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with \u201cnetworking.\u201d He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them:Don\u2019t keep score: It\u2019s never simply about getting what you want. It\u2019s about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too.\u201cPing\u201d constantly: The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time\u2014not just when you need something.Never eat alone: The dynamics of status are the same whether you\u2019re working at a corporation or attending a society event\u2014 \u201cinvisibility\u201d is a fate worse than failure.In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world\u2019s most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama.Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a \u201cconference commando,\u201d and more,Never Eat Alone is destined to take its place alongside How to Win Friends and Influence People as an inspirational classic.",

Known as \"The Intimidator,\" Dale Earnhardt made a name for himself as a fierce competitor, a man with ambition and passion who would never be satisfied being anything less than the best.

Featuring full-color photos from the entire spectrum of Earnhardt's career, Dale Earnhardt: Always a Champion offers reactions from colleagues and fans on the lasting impression made by the respected NASCAR driver. It also presents a solemn perspective on the loved ones he left behind\u2014his family and his sport\u2014and their respective struggles to move on without him.

        "Authors": "By Peluso, Anthony J., Jr. (EDT) and Mariners' Museum (COR)",
        "Description": "Much of what we know about how steamboats looked between about 1835 and 1900 comes from the meticulously detailed paintings of John and James Bard, twin brothers who were born in New York City in 1815, coincidentally the same year that Robert Fulton died. The Bard brothers taught themselves to paint, turning out their first joint work at the age of twelve, and they became the greatest chroniclers of the steamboat era. Working for owners, captains, boat builders - anyone who would commission a ship's portrait - John and James Bard turned out thousands of stunning paintings that have long been treasured by museums and collectors. Sometimes regarded as folk artists because of the naive directness and simplicity of their paintings, the Bards created works that have become icons of Americana.The narrative tells the life stories of the brothers, who grew up in modest circumstances in lower Manhattan. Tragically, John Bard's life ended early. Estranged from his brother, John drifted away from New York, only to return to die in a city poorhouse at about the age of forty. James, however, perhaps the more talented of the two, built a substantial career and continued painting for another forty years, completing his last two watercolors in 1890.The Bard paintings combine the naive charm of these untutored artists with the sharp observations of craftsmen working for demanding clients. Every detail in their work is attended to, from the sculpted figureheads decorating the pilot houses above the steamboat roofs to the gleaming, mullioned glass windows of the passenger saloons. Almost invariably seen in strict profile moving from right to left (so that the trailing banners would read correctly), the steamboats and sailboats in Bard paintings seem as fresh and alive today as they did 150 years ago.",

        "Description": "In the decades since Norman Vincent Peale launched the enormously popular human potential movement with The Power of Positive Thinking, millions have been touched by his message. Now, in the same practical and exhilarating spirit, Eric Fellman guides us even further, with potent results. Fellman illuminates the key spiritual principles behind the Positive Thinking message, and in doing so reveals a path toward self-fulfillment that is refreshingly navigable and relevant.Engaging and always sensible, Fellman's voice provides encouragement and concrete advice as he counters negativity and focuses us all on the personal spirituality at work in our lives today. He shows us how to access that strong - and strengthening - spirituality, how to have faith in it, and how to apply it, as an indispensable element, to every aspect of our modern lives.Stories and testimonies from the many people reached in his years of service bring Fellman's message to life, proving that his program is, above all, achievable. Fellman presents nine clear, surmountable steps, demonstrating how to decide on the essentials in life, set and accomplish goals, develop inner strength, and more. Here also are the tools for successfully tapping the powers of faith, hope, and love that are the driving force behind Positive Thinking.",

He presents a lucid and compelling argument that does not belittle or demonize its subjects. This is an important contribution to our knowledge of the relationship between religion and violence.\"--Martha Crenshaw, editor of Terrorism in Context \"In this important book Juergensmeyer argues that the violence associated with religion is not an aberration but comes from the fundamental structures of the belief system of all major religions. Juergensmeyer has achieved what very few scholars can do with much success, providing an insightful analysis of the function of religion in national and international life while moving in broad sweeps from culture to culture and continent to continent.\"--Ainslie T. Embree, former cultural attach\u00e9, United States Embassy, New Delhi\"Half of the world's thirty most dangerous terrorist groups claim religion as their motivation. How can the word of God sanction acts of terror against human beings ? How can violence become a sacred duty ? These are the questions at the heart of Mark Juergensmeyer's calm, lucid, insightful and compassionate book. What sets it apart is Juergensmeyer's dedicated attempt to talk to former terrorists and work his way into their state of mind. His book shines light on the dark places from which terror springs.\" -- Michael Ignatieff, author of The Warrior's Honour: Ethnic War and the Modern Conscience",

By having at their disposal a comprehensive textbook that offers ample material for a full-year composition course, instructors teaching a one-term course can make various selections from\u00a0Chapters 1-17, from whatever types of specialized writing suits the needs of their students, and from the appropriate essays in the reader. As well, because the authors believe strongly that an effective composition textbook should address students directly, they've aimed for a conversational yet clear style that invites students into the book, lessens their apprehensions about writing, and provides a model for their own prose. This style complements the authors'\u00a0strong student-based approach to writing, and together they help create a text that genuinely meets student needs.",

Collaborating for the first time, Christina Dodd and Connie Brockway take readers on an unforgettable adventure -- from medieval times to present day -- that sparkles with love and laughter.  Once Upon a Pillow  Within a beautiful old English manor house lies a sumptuous antique bed, one of many Masterson family heirlooms that have been sold along with the house. As Laurel Whitney leads the last tour group through the house before it's closed to the public, she regales the visitors with romanticized tales of how this exquisite bed affected the lives of the couples who slept in it. The actual stories -- of a bawdy medieval knight trying to woo his reluctant bride; an insolvent Elizabethan aristocrat who plans to ruin a wealthy heiress but beds her impoverished cousin instead; and a feisty Regency lady whose scheme goes awry when she mistakenly manacles herself (and a dashing colonel) to the bedpost -- are funnier and certainly sexier than anything a tour guide could ever tell!  Shocked to see her lover from the past on the tour, Laurel is even more surprised to find their love rekindled when a twist of fate leaves them no choice but to spend the night in the famed Masterson bed.",

        "Description": "With these character sketches of key figures of the American Revolution and illuminating probes of its circumstances, Bernard Bailyn reveals the ambiguities, complexities, and uncertainties of the founding generation as well as their achievements.  Using visual documentation\u2014portraits, architecture, allegorical engravings\u2014as well as written sources, Bailyn, one of our most esteemed historians, paints a complex picture of that distant but still remarkably relevant world. He explores the powerfully creative effects of the Founders\u2019 provincialism and lays out in fine detail the mingling of gleaming utopianism and tough political pragmatism in Thomas Jefferson\u2019s public career, and the effect that ambiguity had on his politics, political thought, and present reputation. And Benjamin Franklin emerges as a figure as cunning in his management of foreign affairs and of his visual image as he was amiable, relaxed, and amusing in his social life.  Bailyn shows, too, why it is that the Federalist papers\u2014polemical documents thrown together frantically, helter-skelter, by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in a fierce political battle two hundred years ago\u2014have attained canonical status, not only as a penetrating analysis of the American Constitution but as a timeless commentary on the nature of politics and constitutionalism. Professor Bailyn concludes, in a wider perspective, with an effort to locate the effect of the Founders\u2019 imaginative thought on political reformers throughout the Atlantic world.  Precisely how their principles were received abroad, Bailyn writes, is as ambiguous as the personalities of the remarkably creative pro-vincials who founded the American nation.",

The Washington Post called Michael Gruber's previous work \"a miracle of intelligent fiction and among the essential novels of recent years.\" Now comes his most intellectually provocative and compulsively readable novel yet.Tap-tapping the keys and out come the words on this little screen, and who will read them I hardly know. I could be dead by the time anyone actually gets to read them, as dead as, say, Tolstoy. Or Shakespeare. Does it matter, when you read, if the person who wrote still lives?These are the words of Jake Mishkin, whose seemingly innocent job as an intellectual property lawyer has put him at the center of a deadly conspiracy and a chase to find a priceless treasure involving William Shakespeare. As he awaits a killer\u2014or killers\u2014unknown, Jake writes an account of the events that led to this deadly endgame, a frantic chase that began when a fire in an antiquarian bookstore revealed the hiding place of letters containing a shocking secret, concealed for four hundred years. In a frantic race from New York to England and Switzerland, Jake finds himself matching wits with a shadowy figure who seems to anticipate his every move. What at first seems like a thrilling puzzle waiting to be deciphered soon turns into a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, where no one\u2014not family, not friends, not lovers\u2014is to be trusted.Moving between twenty-first-century America and seventeenth-century England, The Book of Air and Shadows is a modern thriller that brilliantly re-creates William Shakespeare's life at the turn of the seventeenth century and combines an ingenious and intricately layered plot with a devastating portrait of a contemporary man on the brink of self-discovery . . . or self-destruction.",

Norman, author of We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese \u201cIt is a well-known fact that war, any war, is senseless and degrading. When innocent people are brought into that war because they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, it becomes incomprehensible. Java, 1942, was such a place and time, and we were those innocent people.\u201dFifty years after the end of World War II, Clara Olink Kelly sat down to write a memoir that is both a fierce and enduring testament to a mother\u2019s courage and a poignant record of an often overlooked chapter of the war.As the fighting in the Pacific spread, four-year-old Clara Olink and her family found their tranquil, pampered lives on the beautiful island of Java torn apart by the invasion of Japanese troops. Clara\u2019s father was taken away, forced to work on the Burma railroad. For Clara, her mother, and her two brothers, the younger one only six weeks old, an insistent knock on the door ended all hope of escaping internment in a concentration camp. For nearly four years, they endured starvation, filth-ridden living conditions, sickness, and the danger of violence from their prison guards. Clara credits her mother with their survival: Even in the most perilous of situations, Clara\u2019s mother never compromised her beliefs, never admitted defeat, and never lost her courage. Her resilience sustained her three children through their frightening years in the camp.Told through the eyes of a young Clara, who was eight at the end of her family\u2019s ordeal, The Flamboya Tree portrays her mother\u2019s tenacity, the power of hope and humor, and the buoyancy of a child\u2019s spirit. A painting of a flamboya tree\u2014a treasured possession of the family\u2019s former life\u2014miraculously survived the surprise searches by the often brutal Japanese soldiers and every last-minute flight. Just as her mother carried this painting through the years of imprisonment and the life that followed, so Clara carries her mother\u2019s unvanquished spirit through all of her experiences and into the reader\u2019s heart.",

During the years of the Cold War, arguably only Beckett, Camus, Sartre, and Brecht rivaled him as a presence in European letters. In this ALTA National Translation Awardwinning new translation of what many critics consider his finest play, Joel Agee gives a fresh lease to a classic of twentieth-century theater. D\u00fcrrenmatt once wrote of himself: I can best be understood if one grasps grotesqueness,\u201d andThe Visit is a consummate, alarming D\u00fcrrenmatt blend of hilarity, horror, and vertigo. The play takes place somewhere in Central Europe\u201d and tells of an elderly millionairess who, merely on the promise of her millions, swiftly turns a depressed area into a boom town. But the condition attached to her largesse, which the locals learn of only after they are enmeshed, is murder. D\u00fcrrenmatt has fashioned a macabre and entertaining parable that is a scathing indictment of the power of greed and confronts the perennial questions of honor, loyalty, and community.",
