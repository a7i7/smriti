        "Authors": "By Phillips, Kevin",
        "Description": "From America's premier political analyst, an explosive examination of the axis of religion, politics, and borrowed money that threatens to destroy the nation  In his two most recent New York Times bestselling books, American Dynasty and Wealth and Democracy, Kevin Phillips established himself as a powerful critic of the political and economic forces that are ruling-and imperiling-the United States. Now, Phillips takes an uncompromising view of the political coalition, led by radical religion, that is driving America to the brink of disaster.  From Ancient Rome to the British Empire, Phillips demonstrates that every world- dominating power has been brought down by a related set of causes: a lethal combination of global over- reach, militant religion, resource problems, and ballooning debt. It is this same axis of ills that has come to define America's political and economic identity in the past decade. Military miscalculations in the Middle East, the surge of fundamentalist religion, the staggering national debt, the costs of U.S. oil dependence-together these factors are undermining our nation's security, solvency, and standing in the world. If left unchecked, the same forces will bring a debt- bloated, preachy, energy-starved America to its knees. With an eye on the past and a searing vision of the future, Phillips has written a book that no American can afford to ignore.  Praise for Kevin Phillips and American Dynasty: \"[Phillips] is a deep thinker extraordinaire, who does a masterful job of connecting the military- industrial dots. . . . A searing indictment of the Bush Dynasty.\" -Douglas Brinkley, Mother Jones  \"Devastating . . . an important, troubling book that should be read everywhere with care, nowhere more so than in this city.\" -Jonathan Yardley, The Washington Post Book World",

Street smart,   with a quick wit and a larger-than-life personality, Nick is the go-to guy,   the owner of Catini's Hardware who's there to score friends tickets to the   big game or fix his daughters' problems. Every Sunday, Nick presides over the   family dinner, dishing out sauce and advice with equal abandon. It is a time   for family, for grandchildren, for men watching football in the living room   while the women gossip and plan in the kitchen. It is a time to remember what   matters most in life. Sunday is the best day of the week, and nobody can   imagine it without Nick.But when Nick is suddenly gone, that is exactly what they have to do--go on   without him. For his girls--Maria, Nina, and Gina--it means learning to stand   on their own feet while arguing about whether or not their mother, Teresa,   can date again. For Teresa, it means trying somehow to keep her family   together, even as she wonders what it would be like to find love again. And   for her carefree son, Johnny, it means making good on his father's last   request, a secret with the power to heal Johnny's guarded heart, if it   doesn't destroy his family in the process.Now, as the first leaves of fall stick to the wet streets of New England,   as the winter snow melts into the pastel hues of spring, and everything seems   new and different, the Catinis will be tested and changed as never before.   For what seems like an insurmountable loss just may be the beginning of the   best part of their lives. . .At once both funny and heartwarming, with one of the most unique,   unforgettable narrators to come along in years, Every   Sunday is a warm, winning novel rich in hope, wisdom and the   surprising strength of second chances.Outstanding Praise For Peter Pezzelli And Home To   ItalyA BookSense Pick! \"A beautiful novel.\u00a0 .\u00a0 .Peter Pezzelli captures the warmth of   Italy--family, friendships, and food--invites us into the world of his   wonderful characters, and takes us full circle on a journey of life and   love.\" --Luanne Rice, New York Times bestselling author\"A delightful story of second chances.\"--Desert Morning News\"Big-hearted and wise, Home to   Italy is a charming ode to the romance of new beginnings and the Italian   gusto for life.

        "Title": "1185 Park Avenue",
        "Authors": "By Roiphe, Anne Richardson",
        "Description": "In this captivating memoir, novelist Anne Roiphe shows us what it was really like to grow up rich and Jewish in New York in the 1940s and 1950s. Revisiting the world of her childhood, Roiphe brings alive a cast of characters who are both difficult to love and impossible to forget. Through the eyes of this precocious, loving daughter, we witness the brutalities that lurked behind the mah-jongg tables, cocktail parties, and summer houses of her family. By turns heartbreaking, funny, and mercilessly honest, Roiphe's story exposes the fault lines of misery that exploded in domestic battles on the home front, far overshadowing the war overseas.  The locus of the story is 1185 Park Avenue. It is one of the buildings on the northern end of the avenue -- just before the train tracks mark the beginning of Harlem -- that wealthy Jewish families claimed as their own in the first half of the 20th century. Amidst the maids and the governesses and the doormen and the psychiatrists live the members of the Roth family, in Apartment 8C. They include an unfaithful father who uses his wife's fortune to entertain other women and play cards at his club; a misfit son who won't eat his food because he believes his parents are trying to poison him; a disappointed mother who waits all day for her five o'clock scotch and her crossword puzzle; and an eager daughter who tries to negotiate peace at the dinner table. Bound by custom and greed, as well as love, they stay together until their world at 1185 Park has done its damage. Only the daughter escapes whole -- to become the writer we now know as Anne Roiphe.  1185 Park Avenue is both a history of an era and a portrait of the artist as a young woman. Roiphe makes it impossible for us to view the 1940s and 1950s with unabashed nostalgia or to think the same way about the people who were crushed by its lies and deceptions. Her redemption, though bittersweet, stands as a haunting triumph long after we have turned the last page of her compelling story.",

Christmas is made illegal, political dissent leads to imprisonment, and too many of Carlos\u2019s friends are leaving Cuba for a place as far away and unthinkable as the United States. Carlos will end up there, too, and fulfill his mother\u2019s dreams by becoming a modern American man\u2014even if his soul remains in the country he left behind. Narrated with the urgency of a confession, Waiting for Snow in Havana is a eulogy for a native land and a loving testament to the collective spirit of Cubans everywhere.",

It is presented in the form of a secret autobiography, a soul-baring document intended for the eyes of a single reader: Elizabeth's brother, lover, and spiritual other half - Victor Frankenstein. The writings are discovered by Sir Robert Walton, the Arctic explorer who, in Mary Shelley's original novel, recorded Victor's deathbed confession. Walton becomes obsessed with learning the full story behind the mad doctor's last words. From the tattered pages of Elizabeth's journal and the scattered clues Walton finds as he re-creates her life, a compelling tale of moral horror unfolds.In her memoirs, Elizabeth emerges as a spirited woman far ahead of her times. Rescued as a child from the Gipsies by the brilliant Lady Caroline Frankenstein, she is raised as young Victor's adopted sister. Under Lady Caroline's guidance, Elizabeth is initiated into a circle of \"cunning women\" - outsiders would call them witches - who are the guardians of long-forgotten pagan ceremonies and healing arts. She and Victor are schooled in ancient teachings that have been transmitted through female adepts who understand the mysteries of nature. The goal is to unite the two in the \"chemical marriage,\" a step toward the union of all opposites that will restore the Earth to balance. The two youths pursue their education through the shadowy realms of alchemical lore and tantric sexual rites until a moment of weakness disrupts the quest. Tormented by shame and anger, Victor turns to the \"unhallowed arts\" that result in his misbegotten Creature, the vengeful fiend who will haunt Elizabeth's fatal wedding night.",

        "Description": "n July of 1776, the American colonies are ablaze with passion.  In the streets, those who would be free boldly read aloud the newly written Declaration of Independence. It is a cry of freedom, but it is also a time of critical confrontation, both on the battlefield and off as the people of a new nation choose between their king and an uncertain future.It is a choice which is not easily made.  As Commander-in-chief George Washington declares a major victory in New York, the rest of the colonies separate into Patriots and Tories.  Kate Darby never expected to be swept up in this political storm.  The Darbys are Quakers who have pledged their allegiance to God first--but that soon changes. Kate's younger brother, Seth, can no longer deny his soul's cry against tyranny.  Fleeing from his Loyalist parents' house to join General Washington's ragtag forces, Seth enters a life he never expected.With the influx of British soldiers, Philadelphia soon becomes a temporary base camp for the English forces.  When the Darbys find themselves forced to take in Major Jonathan Andre, Kate falls quickly for his charm.  Despite her warring affections, Kate finds herself drawn deep into the war.  As she attempts to follow her brother, she risks her life and her family's reputation by becoming a spy for the patriot forces, a role which quickly transforms the once-timid Quaker girl.  With a world of danger and political upheaval thrown before them, Kate and Seth face incredible danger in the hopes of shaping one of the single most important events in American history: the war for freedom.Told with historical accuracy and incredible attention to period detail, Shadow Patriots recreates America at its youngest and describes with vivid intensity the men and women who bravely did their part to deliver it from tyranny.",

        "Authors": "By Weinberger, Caspar W. and Hall, Wynton C.",
        "Description": "They are nineteen of the most highly decorated soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in the United States military, and yet most Americans don\u2019t even know their names. In this riveting, intimate account, former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and Wynton C. Hall tell stories of jaw-dropping heroism and hope in Afghanistan and Iraq. Home of the Brave takes readers beyond the bullets and battles and into the hearts and minds of the men and women who are fighting terrorists overseas so that America doesn\u2019t have to fight them at home. These are the powerful, true-life stories of the hopes, fears, and triumphs these men and women experienced fighting the War on Terror. But more than that, these are the stories of soldiers who risked everything to save lives and defend freedom. Including:*Lieutenant Colonel Mark Mitchell, the Green Beret leader whose 15-man Special Forces team took 500 Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners, and posthumously repatriated the body of the first American to die in combat in the War on Terror, CIA agent Johnny \u201cMike\u201d Spann.*Army National Guard Sergeant Leigh Ann Hester, the first woman ever to be awarded the Silver Star for combat, whose sharp-shooting and bravery played an enormous role in fighting off over fifty Iraqi insurgents while her ten-person squad protected a convoy of supplies on the way to fellow soldiers. *Sergeant Rafael Peralta, a Mexican immigrant, enlisted in the Marines the same day he received his green card. Wounded from enemy fire, Peralta used his body to smother the blast of an enemy grenade and gave his life so that his marine brothers could live. These real-life heroes remind us of American history\u2019s most enduring lesson: Ours would not be the land of the free if it were not also the home of the brave.",

        "Description": "One man\u2019s post-retirement passion for the works of history's greatest literary genius becomes an inspiring intellectual and spiritual adventure--and a lesson in the ageless wisdom to be found in literature.In the twilight of a successful career as a book editor, Herman Gollob attended a superb Broadway production of Hamlet with Ralph Fiennes. The experience proved so galvanizing that it ignited a latent passion for literary scholarship and for all things Shakespearean. Shedding the drudgery of fixing halt and lame manuscripts, he engaged in a fever of self-education via a vast array of books, videotapes, performances, and lectures--becoming, as he put it, \"an old man made mad by love of Shakespeare.\"  In short order, he became so well versed that he began teaching a popular Shakespeare course for seniors at a small local college in New Jersey. He then made a visit to the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.; sought out encounters with great actors and directors--including Olympia Dukakis, Michael Kahn, David Suchet, John Barton, and Cicely Berry; took a summer course on Shakespeare at Oxford; and made a pilgrimage to the Globe Theatre in London to see, of course, Hamlet. This late-blooming Bardomania even enriched the growth of his Jewish identity, resulting in a uniquely Hebraic theory about King Lear.In relating this tale of an autodidact's progress, Gollob interweaves his rich family history, personal experience, and past meetings with the great and notorious, including Orson Welles, James Jones, Lee Marvin, Frank Sinatra, Donald Barthelme, James Clavell, Dan Jenkins, Willie Morris, and a host of others. Like Great Books by David Denby, Me and Shakespeare is a memoir that attests to the lifelong power of literature to enrich, enlarge, and exalt. It is, as well, one of the most entertaining and unusual books on Shakespeare ever written.",

Life on the mountain is beautiful, but it doesn't last forever. Heidi is taken to the big city of Frankfurt, where she becomes a companion to a little girl called Clara. How different life in this rich household is! Heidi does not know how to behave in the city and longs to go back to her mountain home. A classic story of a child's growing understanding of the world, Johanna Spyri's Heidi is especially engaging in this Young Classic edition because children can see what Heidi's life was really like. Photography sets the scene without intruding on the story and brings Heidi to life for a new generation of children.",

        "Description": "The rules for planning a financially secure future are changing. In Independently Wealthy, Robert Goodman, P.h.D., one of the mutual fund industry's foremost economic commentators, asserts that a new economic era is upon us and the national debate on the sweeping changes it will bring has already begun. As this transformation takes root within the tax system and seriously scales back federal retirement income and health-care programs, Uncle Sam will cease to be the major provider, forcing Americans to find alternative ways to provide their own financial security Unless you take the right steps today, Putnam Investments' senior economic advisor tells his audiences all over the country, you may face a bleak financial future. Now, in Independently Wealthy, Dr. Goodman has put his compelling message into print. In the same down-to-earth, no-nonsense style he uses in person, he tells you why you must take control of your own financial future: no one else is going to do it for you Rather than viewing these trends darkly, Dr. Goodman sees them as opportunities. The good news, he says, is that while the government will end or sharply reduce current programs, employers are increasingly shifting from defined-benefit pension plans to such programs as 401(k) and profit-sharing plans that allow employees to make their own decisions about how much to invest and where to invest it. This will give you control over your own financial destiny In Independently Wealthy, Dr. Goodman reviews the economic and political events leading to today's situation. Then he outlines the future's challenges. With that discussion as background, he tells you how much wealth you must accumulate to become financially independent (it may be more than you expected). In addition, he shows you some ways, by which you can achieve the goal (the task may be less formidable than you think) Dr. Goodman tells you why in these increasingly complex times you need a financial advisor\u2014and tells you how to find the right one. He explains the importance of a rock-solid financial plan and provides some time-tested strategies for executing one. Finally, he gives you ten rules to follow as you work your way toward financial independence Dear Fellow Member Owner This book is a practical guide that can assist you and your family in your personal investment and retirement planning The HON Company sponsors two major plans to help you accumulate funds for your investment and retirement planning. We receive stock through the HON Members Company Ownership Plan (ESOP), and we can also purchase HON stock on favorable terms through the Members Stock Purchase Plan.

        "Title": "Daughters of an Amber Noon: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Forrest, Katherine V.",
        "Description": "The lesbian science-fiction classic Daughters of a Coral Dawn told the story of a group of pioneering women who disappeared from Earth and colonized the planet Maternas. But what of their sisters left behind? In the highly anticipated sequel, Katherine Forrest tells the story of a group of women called the Unity, who have vanished from society but are still living on earth. But Earth, repressive before the most accomplished and in-dispensable women disappeared, is now a hellish place ruled by the dictator Theo Zedera, known as Zed, and he is seeking the vanished women with ruthless determination. Among them is Africa Contrera, and as she struggles to build a world safe for women, she is haunted by her past, a past in which she and Zed were close friends, a past where she trusted him and shared the deadly knowledge he now uses to hunt her. Is there hope for this new hidden society of women? However resourceful they may be, can they withstand the savagery of a man who uses their own secrets against them? Just as she did 18 years ago, Katherine Forrest has created a brilliant and breathtaking saga of a divided society and the rebels courageous enough to withstand this brutal new world. Katherine Forrest is also the author of the lesbian romantic classic Curious Wine as well as the groundbreaking Kate Delafield mystery series.",

Uncertain about her future and the troubles she carries, Fawn stops for a drink of water at a roadside inn, where she encounters a patrol of Lakewalkers, enigmatic soldier-sorcerers from the woodland culture to the north. Fawn knows the stories about the Lake-walkers: they are necromancers; they practice black sorcery; they have no permanent homes and own only the clothes they wear and the weapons - mysterious knives made of human bone - they carry. What she does not know is that the Lakewalkers, as a whole, are engaged in a perilous campaign against inhuman and immortal magical entities known as \"malices,\" creatures that suck the life out of all they encounter, and turn men and animals into their minions.Dag is an older Lakewalker patroller who carries his past sorrows as heavily as his present responsibilities. When Fawn is kidnapped by the malice Dag's patrol is tracking, Dag races to rescue her. But in the ensuing struggle, it is not Dag but Fawn who kills the creature - at dire cost - and an uncanny accident befalls Dag's sharing knife, which unexpectedly binds their two fates together. And so now the misenchanted knife must be returned to the Lakewalkers. Together, Fawn and Dag set out on the long road back to his camp. But on the journey this unlikely pair will encounter danger and delight, prejudice and partnership, and maybe even love.",

        "Description": "Advances in neuroscience research are rapidly bringing new and complex issues to the forefront of medical and social ethics, and scholars from diverse fields have been coming together to debate the issues at stake. Acclaimed science writer Sandra Ackerman witnessed one such gathering, and here she skillfully synthesizes those proceedings into a concise presentation of the challenges that neuroscience and neuroethics currently face.\u00a0Top scholars and scientists in neuroscience and ethics convened at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., in May 2005. They included Michael Gazzaniga, director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Dartmouth College; Marcus Raichle of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis; Harvard University provost Steven Hyman; Judy Illes, cofounder of the Stanford Brain Research Center; University of Virginia bioethicist Jonathan Moreno; Stacey Tovino of the Health Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston Law Center; and Stanford law professor Hank Greely.\u00a0\u00a0Ackerman weaves the invigorating arguments and discussions among these and other prominent scholars into a seamless and dynamic narrative. She reveals the wide array of issues that have emerged from recent research, including brain imaging, free will and personal responsibility, disease diagnosis and prediction, brain enhancement, and the potential social, political, and legal ramifications of new discoveries. Translating these complex arguments into an engrossing account of neuroethics, she offers a rare view of science\u2014and ethics\u2014in the making.",
