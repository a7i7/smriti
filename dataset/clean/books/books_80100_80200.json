        "Description": "In this handbook, Knisely (Bucknell University) provides biology students with a practical, readable resource for communicating their scientific knowledge according to the conventions in biology. A beginning chapter introduces the scientific method and experimental design, and subsequent chapters cover locating literature, understanding the tone and format of scientific papers, reading technical material, and the importance of paraphrasing when taking notes. Using the standards of journal publication as a model, students are then given instructions for writing their own lab reports with accepted format and content, evaluating their own drafts, and using peer and instructor feedback to refine their writing. Two final chapters look at poster papers and presentation formats. Appendix chapters give step-by-step instructions, illustrated with b&w screenshots in a two-color format, for word processing in Microsoft Word 2007, making graphs with Excel 2007, and preparing oral presentations with PowerPoint 2007. For this third edition, the focus has shifted away from finding primary references to developing a literature search strategy. Material on documenting sources has been expanded to cover in-text and end-reference format for electronic journal articles, databases, and web sites.

        "Description": "This long-awaited biography, twenty years after the last major account, uncovers Dickens the man through the profession in which he excelled. Drawing on a lifetime\u2019s study of this prodigiously brilliant figure, Michael Slater explores the personal and emotional life, the high-profile public activities, the relentless travel, the charitable works, the amateur theatricals and the astonishing productivity. But the core focus is Dickens\u2019 career as a writer and professional author, covering not only his big novels but also his phenomenal output of other writing--letters, journalism, shorter fiction, plays, verses, essays, writings for children, travel books, speeches, and scripts for his public readings, and the relationships among them.Slater\u2019s account, rooted in deep research but written with affection, clarity, and economy, illuminates the context of each of the great novels while locating the life of the author within the imagination that created them. It highlights Dickens\u2019 boundless energy, his passion for order and fascination with disorder, his organizational genius, his deep concern for the poor and outrage at indifference towards them, his susceptibility towards young women, his love of Christmas and fairy tales, and his hatred of tyranny.Richly and precisely illustrated with many rare images, this masterly work on the complete Dickens, man and writer, becomes the indispensable guide and companion to one of the greatest novelists in the language.",

Carrie is a bridezilla of mythic nastiness, a diva whose tantrums are just about as crazy as her demands. But the unpleasant task at hand turns seriously criminal when Carrie is brutally murdered and everyone involved with the ceremony is accusing one another of doing the deed.The problem is, most everyone\u2014from the cake maker and the florist to the wedding-gown retailer and the bridesmaids\u2019 dressmaker\u2014had his or her own reason for wanting the bride dead, including Jaclyn. And while those who felt Carrie\u2019s wrath are now smiling at her demise, Jaclyn refuses to celebrate tragedy, especially since she finds herself in the shadow of suspicion.Assigned to the case, Detective Eric Wilder finds that there\u2019s too much evidence pointing toward too many suspects. Compounding his problems is Jaclyn, with whom he shared one deeply passionate night before Carrie\u2019s death. Being a prime suspect means that Jaclyn is hands-off just when Eric would rather be hands-on. As the heat intensifies between Eric and Jaclyn, a cold-blooded murderer moves dangerously close. And this time the target is not a bride but one particularly irresistible wedding planner, unaware of a killer\u2019s vow.",

        "Title": "Nomad: From Islam to America: A Personal Journey Through the Clash of Civilizations",
        "Authors": "By Ali, Ayaan Hirsi",
        "Description": "\"This woman is a major hero of our time.\" \u2014Richard Dawkins Ayaan Hirsi Ali captured the world\u2019s attention with Infidel, her compelling coming-of-age memoir, which spent thirty-one weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Now, in Nomad, Hirsi Ali tells of coming to America to build a new life, an ocean away from the death threats made to her by European Islamists, the strife she witnessed, and the inner conflict she suffered. It is the story of her physical journey to freedom and, more crucially, her emotional journey to freedom\u2014her transition from a tribal mind-set that restricts women\u2019s every thought and action to a life as a free and equal citizen in an open society. Through stories of the challenges she has faced, she shows the difficulty of reconciling the contradictions of Islam with Western values. In these pages Hirsi Ali recounts the many turns her life took after she broke with her family, and how she struggled to throw off restrictive superstitions and misconceptions that initially hobbled her ability to assimilate into Western society. She writes movingly of her reconciliation, on his deathbed, with her devout father, who had disowned her when she renounced Islam after 9/11, as well as with her mother and cousins in Somalia and in Europe. Nomad is a portrait of a family torn apart by the clash of civilizations. But it is also a touching, uplifting, and often funny account of one woman\u2019s discovery of today\u2019s America. While Hirsi Ali loves much of what she encounters, she fears we are repeating the European mistake of underestimating radical Islam. She calls on key institutions of the West\u2014including universities, the feminist movement, and the Christian churches\u2014to enact specific, innovative remedies that would help other Muslim immigrants to overcome the challenges she has experienced and to resist the fatal allure of fundamentalism and terrorism. This is Hirsi Ali\u2019s intellectual coming-of-age, a memoir that conveys her philosophy as well as her experiences, and that also conveys an urgent message and mission\u2014to inform the West of the extent of the threat from Islam, both from outside and from within our open societies. A celebration of free speech and democracy, Nomad is an important contribution to the history of ideas, but above all a rousing call to action.",

        "Description": "For one year, Colin Beavan swore off plastic and toxins, turned off his electricity, went organic, became a bicycle nut, and tried to save the planet from environmental catastrophe while dragging his young daughter and his Prada-wearing wife along for the ride. Together they attempted to make zero impact on the environment while living right in the heart of Manhattan, and this is the sensational, funny, and consciousness-raising story of how they did it. With No Impact Man, Beavan found that no-impact living is worthwhile-and richer, fuller, and more satisfying in the bargain.\"Far from being a movement of self-denial and stern lectures about having too much fun, the `no impact' mind-set is actually about increasing fulfillment and happiness by asking us to think about what makes us truly happy and what's really important in our lives.\"\"A deeply honest and riveting account. What might seem inconvenient to the point of absurdity instead teaches lessons that all of us need to learn. One person can make a difference.\"\"Profound...Beavan's project has significant emotional and ecological heft. No Impact Man works, most of all, because Beavan is intelligent, funny, provocative, and, above all, honest.\"\"There's something inspiring about a smart, committed person coming to an elegantly simple conclusion.\"\"You have to give Colin Beavan credit; the man put his money where his mouth is. A self-proclaimed `guilty liberal' tired of the world's general ecological decline, he decided to change his life. And in no small way. Even better, he did it with a sense of humor.\"",

        "Authors": "By Layzer, Judith A.",
        "Description": "The Environmental Case gives readers a unique, first-hand feel for some of the most interesting and illuminating controversies in U.S. environmental policymaking\u2014including the disaster at Love Canal, the dispute over snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park, and the global warming debate. Through 16 carefully constructed cases, Layzer covers the spectrum of environmental issues, from habitat conservation, air and water pollution, and overfishing to environmental justice and urban growth management. Each case elucidates various aspects of the U.S. political system but is also linked to the others by two main themes: environmental conflicts are, at heart, conflicts between advocates with fundamentally different values, and the way problems are framed in politics plays a central role in shaping how those values get translated into policies.This second edition showcases all 12 of the original cases, thoroughly revised and updated. In addition, Layzer has added four new cases:Community activism propels the Dudley Street Neighborhood Association to fight for environmental justice and equitable redevelopment of a once-distressed area in the heart of Boston.The use of snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park divides environmentalists into bitterly opposing camps: those who regard parks as playgrounds and support unlimited motorized access, and those who advocate more conservative management that emphasizes protection of the park\u2019s flora, fauna, and quiet serenity. In the tuna/dolphin and shrimp/turtle disputes, competing advocates debate whether U.S. environmental protection measures constitute non-tariff barriers to trade and, more broadly, whether trade liberalization is good for the environment. Opponents of growth management campaign to undermine the city of Portland\u2019s strict policies curbing urban sprawl, the most stringent in the nation. Layzer provides maps, tables, figures, questions to consider, recommended readings, and useful websites to help readers think critically and actively about the issues raised in each case and facilitate further research.",

His gripping narrative takes us into the fields, cabins, and manors of pre-Civil War plantations in the South and reveals the daily terrors he suffered as a slave. \u00a0 Written more than a century and a half ago by an African-American who went on to become a famous orator, U.S. minister to Haiti, and leader of his people, this timeless classic still speaks directly to our age. It is a record of savagery and inhumanity that goes far to explain why America still suffers from the great injustices of the past. \u00a0 With an Introduction by Peter J.

As citizens we must now mobilize our spiritual and political resources for transformative change on all three fronts.\u201d\u2014Gus Speth How serious are the threats to our environment? Here is one measure of the problem: if we continue to do exactly what we are doing, with no growth in the human population or the world economy, the world in the latter part of this century will be unfit to live in. Of course human activities are not holding at current levels\u2014they are accelerating, dramatically\u2014and so, too, is the pace of climate disruption, biotic impoverishment, and toxification. In this book Gus Speth, author of Red Sky at Morning and a widely respected environmentalist, begins with the observation that the environmental community has grown in strength and sophistication, but the environment has continued to decline, to the point that we are now at the edge of catastrophe.Speth contends that this situation is a severe indictment of the economic and political system we call modern capitalism. Our vital task is now to change the operating instructions for today\u2019s destructive world economy before it is too late. The book is about how to do that.",

        "Authors": "By Esposito, John L.",
        "Description": "In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, there has been an overwhelming demand for information about Islam. As a leading expert, John Esposito has found himself called upon to speak to a wide range of audiences, including members of Congress, the Bush administration, government agencies, the military, and the media. Out of this experience, he has identified the most pressing questions people consistently ask about Islam.       In What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam, Esposito presents in question-and-answer format the information that most people want to know. Esposito provides succinct, accessible, sensitive, and even-handed answers to questions that range from the general--\"What do Muslims believe?\" and \"Who was Muhammad?\"--to more specific issues like Is Islam compatible with modernization, capitalism and democracy? How do Muslims view Judaism and Christianity? Are women second-class citizens in Islam? What is jihad? Does the Quran condone terrorism? What does Islam say about homosexuality, birth control, abortion, and slavery?       The editor of The Oxford Encyclopedia of Modern Islam and The Oxford History of Islam, and author of Unholy War and many other acclaimed works, John Esposito is one of America's leading authorities on Islam. This brief and readable book is the first place to look for information on the faith, customs, and political beliefs of the more than one billion people who call themselves Muslims.",

        "Description": "Banish the mess at home, finally! With Good Housekeeping's unique room-by-room, zone-by-zone, clutter-busting guide, you can win the fight against clutter--not only for a day or a week but once and for all. Features the Good Housekeeping seal on the cover. You've spent 20 minutes looking for the remote, looked high and low for your favorite sweater, and missed paying a bill on time because it was stuffed in the junk drawer. But no more! On the heels of the wildly successful Good Housekeeping The Complete Household Handbook, this illustrated reference--with a hidden spiral and tabs for easy access to each subject--addresses one of our most pressing predicaments: getting rid of home clutter forever.You'll find invaluable advice on making real changes--some simple, other more complex--that transform the way you use space so clutter never happens in the first place. This household guide is cleverly organized by room, and each room is broken down into well-defined zones. Each zone features a clock icon showing roughly how long each one will take to de-clutter, and \"Keeping Up\" sections at the end of each chapter help you make sure that everything stays in its place. Tackle every zone in each room--one zone at a time--and you'll get your entire home organized--even if you devote less than a few minutes a day.No home should be without it",
