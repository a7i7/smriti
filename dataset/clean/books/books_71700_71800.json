But with her single-minded passion for \u00e9clairs and clotted cream, her prospects on both counts seem dim. That's why the summons to attend a family reunion at the old ancestral home is about as welcome as a snakebite. How can\u00a0she show up with her embarrassingly full figure in her humble unmarried state and keep her chins up? Enter Bentley T. Haskell of Eligibility Escorts, a devastatingly attractive writer of smutty novels who also cooks like a dream. With Bentley posing as her besotted beau, Ellie feels brave enough to beard her batty relations in their den. . . .But mouldering Merlin's Court is nothing like Ellie remembers, and with her wretchedly beautiful cousin Vanessa making eyes at Ben, and her malevolent old uncle Merlin popping up in the most unexpected places, it's enough to put Ellie off her food. And the best\u2014and worst\u2014is yet to come, as the weekend leads to sudden death, unexpected romance, and a treasure hunt that promises epicurean Ellie wealth, hearth, and happiness . . . if she survives.Praise for The Thin Woman\u201c[Dorothy] Cannell makes a delicious debut; discriminatory whodunit fans will want more of her inventions.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly\u201cA likable debut\u2014combining fairy-tale romance, treasure hunts, and a homicidal mania.\u201d\u2014Kirkus Reviews",

        "Title": "A Tragic Legacy: How a Good vs. Evil Mentality Destroyed the Bush Presidency",
        "Authors": "By Greenwald, Glenn",
        "Description": "What will be the legacy of President George Walker Bush? In this fascinating, timely book, Glenn Greenwald examines the Bush presidency and its long-term effect on the nation. What began on shaky, uncertain ground and was bolstered and propelled by tragedy, has ultimately faltered and failed on the back of the dichotomous worldview\u2014good versus evil\u2014that once served it so well. In A Tragic Legacy, Greenwald charts the rise and steep fall of the current administration, dissecting the rhetoric and revealing the faulty ideals upon which George W. Bush built his policies.On September 12, 2001, President Bush addressed the nation and presented a very clear view of what was to come\u2014a view that can be said to define his entire presidency: \u201cThis will be a monumental struggle of good versus evil.\u201d Based on his own Christian faith and backed by biblical allusions, Bush\u2019s worldview was basic and binary\u2014and everyone was forced to choose a side. Riding high on public support, Bush sailed through the early \u201cWar on Terror,\u201d easily defining our enemies and clearly setting an agenda for defeating them.But once the war became murkier\u2014its target unclear, its combatants no longer seen in black-and-white\u2014support for Bush and his policies dropped precipitously. Glenn Greenwald brilliantly reveals the reasons behind the collapse of Bush\u2019s power and approval, and argues that his greatest weakness is the same rhetoric that once propelled him so far forward. Facing issues that could not be turned into simple good versus evil choices\u2014the disaster of Hurricane Katrina, his plans for Social Security \u201creform,\u201d and, most ironic, the failed Dubai ports deal\u2014Bush faltered and fell. Now, Greenwald argues, Bush is trapped by his own choices, unable to break out of the mold that once served him so well, and indifferent to the consequences.A Tragic Legacy is the first true character study of one of the most controversial men ever to hold the office of president. Enlightening, powerful, and eye-opening, this is an in-depth look at the man whose incapability and cowboy logic have left America at risk.",

Like all great comic strips, it provides a much-needed daily dose of comedy and, most importantly, keeps its finger firmly planted on the pulse of truth while doing so.\" Some might think that the corporate scandals of 2002 could make it difficult to find anything funny about today's business world. But When Body Language Goes Bad proves it will take more than that to slow down the inventive wit of Scott Adams, who clearly is never at a loss for finding hysterical things to mock in corporate life.This marks the 21st collection of Adams' wildly popular comic strip, Dilbert, which is featured in more than 2,000 newspapers worldwide. This book updates loyal readers on the so-called careers of Dilbert, Alice, Wally, Asok the intern, and other regulars as they wallow through pointless projects, mismanaged company takeovers, futile team-building exercises, and other inane company initiatives like the \"name the rest room\" contest.In addition to the strips' familiar characters, this collection showcases Adams' masterful ability to create hilarious \"guest stars.\" There's the network design engineer known as Psycho Hillbilly, who was going for the gentle biker look until he decided it was overdone. Then, there's M. T. Suit, who is merely an empty suit walking the office halls spewing corporatese, such as \"promising to enhance core competencies by leveraging platforms.\"Adams says that about 80 percent of his initial ideas come from his 150 million-plus readers. Those worldwide readers are sure to celebrate the humor found in When Body Language Goes Bad, his latest satirical look at the modern workplace.",

Suddenly, this mother of a six-year-old is the young widow in a bucolic small town. And this is only the beginning. Seven months after Henry's death, just when Julie thinks she is emerging from the worst of it, comes the rest of it: She discovers that what had appeared to be the reality of her marriage was but a half-truth. Henry had hidden another life from her.\"He loved you so much.\" That's what everyone keeps telling her. It's true that he loved Julie and their six-year-old daughter ebulliently and devotedly, but as she starts to pick up the pieces and rebuild her life without Henry in it, she learns that Henry had been unfaithful throughout their twelve years of marriage. The most damaging affair was ongoing--a tumultuous relationship that ended only with Henry's death.For Julie, the only thing to do was to get at the real truth--to strip away the veneer of \"perfection\" that was her life and confront each of the women beneath the veneer. Perfection is the story of Julie Metz's journey through chaos and transformation as she creates a different life for herself and her young daughter. It is the story of coming to terms with painful truths, of rebuilding both a life and an identity after betrayal and widowhood. It is a story of rebirth and happiness--if not perfection.",

        "Title": "Big-Box Swindle: The True Cost of Mega-Retailers and the Fight for America's Independent Businesses",
        "Authors": "By Mitchell, Stacy",
        "Description": "In less than two decades, large retail chains have become the most powerful corporations in America. In this deft and revealing book, Stacy Mitchell illustrates how mega-retailers are fueling many of our most pressing problems, from the shrinking middle class to rising pollution and diminished civic engagement\u2014and she shows how a growing number of communities and independent businesses are effectively fighting back.Mitchell traces the dramatic growth of mega-retailers\u2014from big boxes like Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Costco, and Staples to chains like Starbucks, Olive Garden, Blockbuster, and Old Navy\u2014and the precipitous decline of independent businesses. Drawing on examples from virtually every state in the country, she unearths the extraordinary impact of these companies and the big-box mentality on everything from soaring gasoline consumption to rising poverty rates, failing family farms, and declining voting levels. Along the way, Mitchell exposes the shocking role government policy has played in the expansion of mega-retailers and builds a compelling case that communities composed of many small, locally owned businesses are healthier and more prosperous than those dominated by a few large chains.More than a critique, Big-Box Swindle provides an invigorating account of how some communities have successfully countered the spread of big boxes and rebuilt their local economies. Since 2000, more than two hundred big-box development projects have been halted by groups of ordinary citizens, and scores of towns and cities have adopted laws that favor small-scale, local business development and limit the proliferation of chains. From cutting-edge land-use policies to innovative cooperative small-business initiatives, Mitchell offers communities concrete strategies that can stave off mega-retailers and create a more prosperous and sustainable future.\u201cWhat Nickel and Dimed did for the Wal-Mart worker, Mitchell does for the community threatened by mega-retailers.\u201d \u2014Bill McKibben, author of The End of Nature\u201cThrough rich, real-life stories, Stacy Mitchell reveals that those \u2018low prices\u2019 so proudly promoted by big-box behemoths come at an intolerably high cost to our communities and culture. Can we beat the behemoths? Yes! And Mitchell shows us the way. Read on, take heart, and take action!\u201d \u2014Jim Hightower, national radio commentator, writer, public speaker, and best-selling author\u201cStacy Mitchell provides an astonishing expos\u00e9 of the broad-reaching implications of our shopping habits. Big-Box Swindle should be required reading for everyone who cares about America\u2019s main streets, as well as a call to arms for small businesses everywhere to organize and take action.\u201d \u2014Kennedy Smith, former director of the National Trust for Historic Preservation\u2019s National Main Street Center\u201cA well-researched and frightening book about an economic pandemic engulfing the United States . . .

The commercial culture of holidays extends from the traditional -- decorations, costumes, and cards -- to the immaterial and ephemeral -- phone calls, airline tickets, and department store bills. Simultaneously colorful presentation and careful analysis, The Business of Holidays interprets holiday commerce and design, corporate culture, and tradition (invented and inherited). This volume consists of more than thirty-five essays arranged according to the calendar year, from New Year's Day and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day to Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa, and explores longstanding holiday images, such as Santa Claus and shamrocks, as well as quirkier aspects of visual culture. The rites that surround these special days have been adopted, or even invented by, the pervasive marketing that surrounds them to such an extent that the celebration of holidays and the business of holidays have become inseparable.",
