        "Authors": "By Vise, David A.",
        "Description": "Called \"a first-rate spy story\" (Entertainment Weekly), The Bureau and the Mole is the sensational New York Times best-seller that tells the inside story of FBI counterintelligence agent Robert Philip Hanssen, a seemingly all-American boy who would become the perfect traitor, jeopardizing America's national security for over twenty years by selling top-secret information to the Russians. Drawing from a wide variety of sources in the FBI, the Justice Department, the White House, and the intelligence community, Pulitzer Prize-winning author David A. Vise tells the story of how Hanssen employed the very sources and methods his own nation had entrusted to him in a devious game of deceit -- simply because he had something to prove. Vise also interweaves the narrative of how FBI director Louis B. Freeh led the government's desperate search for its betrayer among its own ranks, from the false leads, to the near misses, to its ultimate, shocking conclusion. Fascinating, gripping, and provocative, The Bureau and the Mole is a harrowing tale of how one man's treachery rocked a fraternity built on fidelity, bravery, and integrity -- and how the dedicated perseverance of another brought him to justice. \"Absorbing ... Vise's account of Mr. Hanssen's road to becoming a double agent is fascinating.\" -- Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times \"Brisk, well documented ... a penetrating study of the villain and a gripping summary of the appalling evidence against him.\" -- Charles McCarry, The Wall Street Journal \"A carefully researched and compelling account, with a startling bombshell.\" -- David W. Marston, The Baltimore Sun \"Intelligent and well researched.\" -- Allen Weinstein, The Washington Post Book World",

There's only one catch . . . he has four legs and a tail.Relatively indifferent to the natural world, allergic to dogs, and happily independent, writer Louise Bernikow never had a pet and knew nothing about caring for one. But one day while running along Manhattan's Hudson River, she came across an abandoned boxer. He had a gimpy leg and a dim past, but Bernikow instantly, bewilderingly, did the one thing her mother always warned her not to do-she brought the strange male home.Here is the comical and offbeat story of their first year together. Libro, as she comes to call him (for \"book,\" in Spanish), introduces her to the curious world of dog runs and dog people, and to a local dive where the bartender pulls pints from the tap and dog biscuits from the drawer. Bernikow, in turn, introduces Libro to the eccentric neighbors and to life as a media hound. When they meet a handsome man and his equally handsome dachshund, life takes an unexpected turn for both of them.Wonderfully written and captivating to the last, this is a remarkable tale of companionship.",

From superstar actors to independent directors, women in all arenas of the moviemaking business opened up to Abramowitz. Their firsthand tales of jealousy, struggle, sexism, and success make for a fascinating behind-the-cameras look at what it is really like to be a woman in Hollywood.Here, in their own candid and provocative words, are Jodie Foster, Penny Marshall, Dawn Steel, Sue Mengers, Sherry Lansing. Polly Platt, Barbra Streisand, Paula Weinstein, Nora Ephron, Carrie Fisher, Meryl Streep, Jane Campion, Amy Heckerling, Callie Khouri, Joan Tewkersbury, and many others.Woven throughout the individual dramas is a strikingly original analysis of the films of the last four decades that fairly and accurately shows the difficulty women have faced in getting their stories on screen. With telling details from the insiders themselves, Abramowitz reveals the almost reflexive sexism that exists in Hollywood and traces how the male-dominated atmosphere influences what is seen by moviegoers around the world.",

        "Description": "With text by Henry Beard, founder of the National Lampoon and illustrations by Roy McKie, here is the New York Times bestselling lexicon of sailing--or, the art of getting wet and becoming ill while slowly going nowhere at great expense.Sailing embarks upon uncharted waters, diving authoritatively into terms like adrift (a boat that is drifting), aglub (a boat that is sinking), and flotsam (anything floating in the water from which there is no response when the offer of a cocktail is made).Full-sail ahead, flying the flag of obsession, the book lists close to 200 definitions and presents more than 50 full-page cartoons--to bring new meaning not just to the anchor and Aneroid Barometer, but to the boom, buoy, brightwork, and Beaufort Scale, too. The book plumbs the depths of the sea's rich traditions, providing a fix on the catamaran and dinghy, the gunwale and jib-boom, the mizzen, porthole, and ketch (a disagreeable clause in many boat-purchase contracts). 710,000 copies in print.",

As Kathryn struggles with her grief, she descends into a maelstrom of publicity stirred up by the modern hunger for the details of tragedy. Even before the plane is located in waters off the Irish coast, the relentless scrutiny of her husband's life begins to bring a bizarre personal mystery into focus. Could there be any truth to the increasingly disturbing rumors that he had a secret life?",

After a rough-and-tumble childhood in San Francisco's hardscrabble Mission District\u2014where he was raised by his colorful extended family\u2014he became a political junkie at the age of nine, and once received help with his homework from Harry Truman. But Rogan traveled with a tough circle of friends; after years of borderline delinquency he was expelled from high school, became a porn theater bouncer, and then a bartender at a strip joint and a Hell's Angels bar. Along the way, a young Arkansas politician advised him to study law and become a member of a different kind of bar. In time Rogan scrapped his way through college and law school. He was appointed a Los Angeles County DA, prosecuting members of the notorious Crips and Bloods gangs; then became a judge, a state legislator, and finally a congressman from Southern California. And in 1998, as a Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, he found himself prosecuting the impeachment of the President of the United States\u2014Bill Clinton, the same Arkansas politician who advised him to go into law and politics two decades earlier. Rough Edges is a rarity among Washington tales: full of outrageous stories, wild humor, pull-no-punches candor, and downright fun. Replete with character and characters, and told in Rogan's engaging and unswervingly frank voice, Rogan's story is certainly the most freewheeling\u2014and perhaps the most honest\u2014political memoir ever written.",

But when Wood's daughter announces that she is smitten with a college classmate and intends to marry him, her parents are stunned. Their daughter's beloved is none other than the son of Wood's lost love, Duff -- romantic chemistry has repeated itself in the next generation!The impending wedding will lead the free-spirited Duff, now an IHOP waitress, to return to the town and the man she left behind, for the first time in twenty years. As Wood's and Duff's reckless behavior progresses, they are forced to question whether their rediscovered passion is worth shattering their children's future and Milan's faith in her husband, and abandoning the friendships and values that they have clung to since childhood. As one of the group says to Wood, \"See, it's not just you having an affair. Now we're all having an affair.\"During this one tumultuous year, there is a revelation of sexual identity, an unexpected death, a birth, and a wedding, bringing about as many changes as the national discount superstore that is destroying the very heart of the town.

Betty and Bunt can see China from their parlor, but they have never been there. They detest Chinese food. \"The Chinese take-away,\" as they call the Hand-over, does not particularly concern them.When Bunt first meets Mr. Hung, a well-spoken gentleman from the Chinese mainland, he pays him little heed. And when Mr. Hung offers the Mullards a handsome sum for their family business - a fifty-year-old textile factory, Imperial Stitching, that was cofounded by Bunt's late father - Bunt refuses him out of hand. Yet it soon grows clear that Mr. Hung is different from the Chinese the Mullards have lived alongside for years. For Mr. Hung will accept no refusals.Then a young woman from the Mullards' factory vanishes, one of many disappearances. But this one is different. Ah Fu has last been seen in the company of Mr. Hung. And so Bunt is forced for the first time in his forty-three years to make decisions that matter. He even begins, maybe, to discover love. Yet against all of Bunt's good, if half-formed, intentions are pitted the will of Mr. Hung and the looming threat of the ultimate betrayal.",

        "Description": "A novel for anyone who remembers first love -- and who wonders what might have been...  There is life after death. Or at least that is what one recently widowed woman discovers in this poignant and contemporary novel about old love lost and new love found.  After twenty-seven years of being a devoted wife and mother, Charlotte Haberman suddenly finds herself alone. With the death of her husband after a long, painful struggle with cancer and all three of her children off to college, Charlotte realizes that she is not only alone -- she is free. And she is young enough at forty-seven to want more than memories.  She had loved and admired her husband, Stan, as did almost everyone else in their small Nebraska town where he ran the local newspaper. He was a truly good man, and an especially good father. Now, as Charlotte grieves, she also forces herself to look ahead to a future as a single woman. But her three children are devastated by his loss; they can't imagine life without him, and they can't imagine their mother's life with anyone else. They resist any suggestion that she might eventually date other men, and are horrified when Charlotte announces she is going to sell the family home.  Nervous about the future, but determined not to be buried with her husband, Charlotte remains firm in her resolve to start over again with or without the approval of her children. First however she must banish a memory that will not die: Cory Lee Jones, the boy she loved before Stan. She had known Cory Lee for only one summer, but she remembers it as the most glorious and most passionate summer of her life, never forgotten and perhaps never gotten over. But Cory Lee went to Vietnam, and when he returned to America, he did not come back to Charlotte. Free now to explore the past, she sets out with renewed purpose, both to find him and to put to rest at last any lingering doubts about what might have been.  In the course of her search, Charlotte encounters many obstacles -- the romantic problems of her children (especially Suzanne, the youngest, who recently suffered a miscarriage, and whose hopes for a career as a doctor are put on indefinite hold when she marries), her sister's disintegrating marriage, and her mother's sour disapproval of virtually everything Charlotte says and does. In between, there are her own entanglements -- a brief, bittersweet romance with a younger man who reminds her more than she'd like to admit of Cory Lee, and a genuine, gradual attraction between her and a retired military officer. And finally there is Cory Lee himself, to whom she makes a final pilgrimage in her search for herself, so that at last she can get on with her life.  With a warm, appealing heroine who unflinchingly faces every curve life throws her way, If Love Were All will speak to any woman who has ever yearned for a midlife romantic adventure, or daydreamed about her first love.",

        "Description": "The book business is in a slump in Farberville, and Claire Malloy, owner of The Book Depot, is feeling the pinch of financial woes and the pull of summer doldrums. The plucky amateur sleuth thinks her life is for the birds until a mysterious new predicament sends her to a posh lakefront community near a bird sanctuary. The problem: Her friend Luanne is having an affair with a man she wants to believe is the perfect lover - except that he just may have murdered both his previous wives.Despite her friend's gushing description, Claire thinks \"perfect lover\" is pushing it. Dick Cissel is a dentist, not a Don Juan. He has some charm, but it gets dimmed by his sulky daughter and the suspicions of a surly police chief. Captain Gannett is determined to prove Dick drowned his first wife and killed his beautiful second wife in a boat explosion. Now Luanne wants Claire to establish conclusively that Dick is no Bluebeard and, therefore, prime matrimonial material.Setting aside her money worries for the time being, Claire plunges into an investigation that she hopes will lead to some vital clues that can document Dick's innocence. But she is getting into dangerously over-her-head hot water with some of the dirt she unearths about the surprisingly unsaintly dead wives, the beady-eyed, bird-watching neighbors, and a disturbingly sexy bird doctor. And even when Claire's aviary excursion takes the lid off a nest of greed, passion, and oh-so-clever murder, there still remains one very menacing question for this intrepid sleuth who's coming too close for a killer's comfort: If Dick didn't murder his wives, who did?Once again, Joan Hess combines her delightful narrative voice with the ingenious plotting that has made her one of today's preeminent mystery writers.",
