It was once minimized and misunderstood as   forgetfulness in the elderly, but Alzheimer\u2019s is now at the forefront of many medical   and scientific agendas, for as the world\u2019s population ages, the disease will touch the lives of virtually everyone. David Shenk movingly captures the disease\u2019s   impact on its victims and their families, and he looks back through history, explaining   how Alzheimer\u2019s most likely afflicted such figures as Jonathan Swift, Ralph Waldo   Emerson, and Willem de Kooning. The result is a searing and graceful account   of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, offering a sobering, compassionate, and ultimately encouraging   portrait.",

        "Description": "Vanity Fair's veteran special correspondent pulls back the curtain on the world of celebrity and those who live and die there  Vanity Fair's Maureen Orth always makes news. From Hollywood to murder trials to the corridors of politics, this National Magazine Award winner covers lives led in public, on camera, in the headlines. Here she takes us close-up into the world of fame-bridging entertainment, politics, and news-and the lives of those who understand the chemistry, the very DNA, of fame and how to create it, manipulate it, sustain it. Moving from former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to Michael Jackson, the ultimate child/monster of show business, Orth describes our evolution from a society where talent attracted attention to a place where the star-making machinery of the \"celebrity-industrial complex\" shapes, reshapes, and sells its gods (and monsters) to the public.  From divas letting their hair down (Tina Turner) to Little Gods (Woody Allen and Princess Diana's almost father-in-law Mohammed Fayed), political theater (Arnold's Hollywood hubris, Arianna Huttington's guru-guided gubernatorial quest), news-gone-soap-opera (I Love Laci), and even the Queen Mother of reinvention (Madonna as dominatrix/children's-book author), Orth delivers a portrait of an era. She shows us the real world of the big room where the rules that govern mere mortals don't matter-and anonymity is a crime.",

        "Description": "By the second Christmas of the Civil War in 1862, the childlike optimism the soldiers carried with them into conflict had faded. These were after all young boys who had just spent Christmas away from home, sleeping in frozen puddles and scraping together bacon fat and hardtack for their Christmas feasts. Many spent Christmas Day writing letters to their families either lamenting their sorry conditions or saying their final farewells in anticipation of the battle to come. The enemy had begun to seem, more than North or South, the war itself.Then just after Christmas in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, a small miracle occurred. On the eve of the bloody Battle of Stones River, the Union and Confederate armies set up camp within shouting distance of one another. To raise their spirits, they began a combative volley of patriotic tunes - \"Yankee Doodle\" drowned out by \"Dixie.\" Then a Union band began to play \"Home Sweet Home.\" A Confederate band chimed in, and soon every regimental band and every soldier, Rebel and Yankee alike, swelled the chorus.Filled with soldiers' letters - marked by humor, yearning, and courage - as well as Christmas poems and songs from the period, God Rest Ye Merry, Soldiers is a testament to the soldiers' legacy: the hope that even the deepest divisions of a nation torn apart by war may someday be healed.",

The best weight-loss and weight-gain diets are described, as are how they fit into a cycle-training program for year-round benefits (before and after a contest). The wise use of food supplements, including protein, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements, is thoroughly discussed in this book.   Supercut is highlighted with nutrition secrets and tips from the greats of bodybuilding--Rachel McLish, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou Ferrigno, Dr. Franco Columbo, Laura Combes, Candy Csencsits, Samir Bannout, and a host of others. Every aspect of the role nutrition plays in their winning training efforts is covered, including favorite recipes for healthful dining. Recipes for vegetable dishes, salads, poultry and dairy-product meals, fish dishes, meat, rice/potato/pasta/grain dishes, and desserts--more than 200 of them, each with calorie counts--are provided. Week-long meal plans incorporating these recipes provide examples of how to reduce caloric intake gradually and safely without affecting increased training efforts.   Joyce L.

        "Authors": "By Deitchman, Seymour J. and Deitchman, Swymour J.",
        "Description": "As the sole remaining superpower, shouldn't the United States be able to call the tune on establishing a secure world to our liking? While most international strategists conjure up history and theory of international relations from the past to examine such a question, Sy Deitchman, in On Being a Superpower, focuses on today's changing conditions and attitudes. He starts by addressing hypothetical situations that keep US international security experts awake at night. What would the United States do, he asks, if, in Saudi Arabia, an armed rebellion by Islamic fundamentalists were about to topple the House of Saud while demanding that the US get out of the Middle East? Would the United States go to war to try stop China's invasion of a democratic Taiwan that declares its independence? Could the US really win such a war against a determined country that has over a billion people and nuclear weapons? If a Central American drug cartel gained de facto control of the Panama canal and turned it into a smuggling lynchpin, what would the United States do?Deitchman examines these and other scenarios and then pictures how the US would likely respond, based on our society's current moral concerns, political rhetoric, and overall world view. After reviewing the challenges the world will present to us and examining the current state of our nation and its armed forces, Deitchman describes the strategy for preserving US security that appears to be emerging without explicit planning. He shows how trends in the armed forces parallel the trends in society, and how our argumentative political system is affecting our ability to build and use military power to support our strategy. Deitchman's synthesis of all these themes shows that the existing trends in the nation and the world are not favorable for our future security. Can they be changed? And if so, how? That's the conundrum readers of this book are invited to ponder.",

        "Title": "Revolution at the Roots: Making Our Government Smaller, Better and Closer to Home",
        "Authors": "By Eggers, William D. and O'Leary, John",
        "Description": "Reason Foundation analysts William Eggers and John O'Leary spent two years traveling America's political frontier, taking the nation's political pulse. They heard a single message: \"To forge a better society we need to make government dramatically smaller, more efficient, and closer to the people it is intended to serve.\" More importantly, they met many revolutionaries who are doing just that. In Revolution at the Roots, you'll find out not just what's wrong with American government, but how Americans can fix it.  With engaging and witty style, the authors chronicle scores of exciting examples of those pushing the boundaries of radical change. You'll meet the new breed of political leaders who are shaking up the status quo, from governors such as New Jersey's Christine Todd Whitman and Wisconsin's Tommy Thompson to California's Pete Wilson. You'll also meet the big-city mayors, Democrat and Republican alike, who are standing up to entrenched interests and shrinking bureaucracies.  But it is America's people, not her politicians, who are truly the driving force for change. You'll hear the story of James Chapman, the Indianapolis cab driver who fought City Hall -- and won. You'll learn why Sister Connie Driscoll, who runs a Chicago homeless shelter, won't accept government funds. You'll read about the gray-haired citizen volunteers who assist with San Diego's pathbreaking community policing program.  Big Government is on the way out, and something must replace it. Eggers and O'Leary lay out common-sense principles for bringing the state back to the people:  Focus on core functions  Devolve power to communities and individuals  Radically decentralize  Embrace competition  Set limits on government growth  They go on to show how these principles can improve government's response to the major issues of our time, from crime to welfare, from education to the economy.  The future of America can be found beyond the Beltway, where fresh ideas are renewing America's great democratic experiment. The positive, practical vision of Revolution at the Roots is the road map to better government that America is searching for as it approaches the 21st century.",

What would vivacious Rose have done?She would not have kept it a secret, Conrad decides, so he begins to share his story. And suddenly he finds himself at the center of Rose's life in a way he'd never experienced, learning how she touched the lives of people he barely knew. These people, from a silent, damaged young woman to the twittering ladies of Rose's drama group, shape his own days as they make unlikely pilgrimages to the garden. Conrad had thought his life was over, but something vital has yet to happen, on the wings of Rose's last message of love.Incandescent, quirky, and poignant, Rose's Garden is an unforgettable story of undying love.",

Stimson, knowing that high-ranking members of the military had falsely testified before the various bodies investigating the attack on Pearl Harbor, selected a then-unknown major by the name of Henry C. Clausen to undertake a new investigation. From November 1944 to September 1945, Clausen traveled more than 55,000 miles and interviewed over a hundred U.S. and British Army, Navy, and civilian personnel. He was given the authority to go anywhere and question anyone under oath, from enlisted personnel right up to George C. Marshall, the chief of staff. He ultimately presented an 800 page report to Stimson?a report that revealed a massive operational failure by the United States to use the priceless intelligence signals that it had obtained months before Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor is the \"final judgement\"-the story behind Clausen's investigation and a blistering account of his conclusions.",

In an astonishing, perfectly plotted mission, Sherbatov is snatched from the waters of Lake Bakail and taken out of Russia to the Middle East, where he will use his genius to harness the most elusive force on earth: controlled nuclear fusion. Part of a project that is creating gold from bismuth by bombarding it with massive amounts of energy, Sherbatov believes he is helping Israel. But within that nation a civil war is brewing, and the secret of the Negev is a secret that will rock not only the Jewish state, but the entire world economy.American physics professor Hillsdale Landover has been chosen by the CIA to uncover the Israeli project. An innocent plunged into the wrong place at the wrong time, Landover, along with the beautiful Israeli Rachel Ravid, becomes the only witness to a plot that involves top clandestine warriors and military personnel in both Israel and the United States. Suddenly, Landover and Ravid are on the run, caught between a U.S.-raised Palestinian terrorist, a CIA agent gone bad, and Israeli Mossad officers who shoot first and ask questions later. The faster the fugitives run, the closer they come to exposing an alliance of renegades in the top ranks of their governments, and a shifting cast of friends turned deadly enemies, and former enemies turned co-conspirators.Shadow Wars blends cutting-edge physics with world economic balances, covert operations with political grandstanding, and a furious life-and-death struggle with a burgeoning love affair between a man and a woman from two very different backgrounds - who can trust no one but each other.",

As an adolescent, Renne Sundheimer had the musical world at his feet; hailed as potentially the greatest cellist who ever lived, he toured the world's concert halls, basking in the adoration of his fans and the admiration of the critics. Then suddenly, at the age of eighteen, his gift deserted him, and for the last fifteen years he has made his living as a cello teacher at a large university in Southern California, practicing five or six hours a day in the hope that his gift will return.Suddenly Renne's life is altered radically by two disparate events: receiving a summons to jury duty, where he unwillingly becomes a juror in a murder trial for the brutal killing of a Buddhist monk; and becoming the teacher of another cello prodigy, an unprepossessing nine-year-old Korean boy whose brilliant talent, potential and musicianship remind Renne of his own past.The Soloist is an extraordinary achievement, and one that Random House feels privileged to publish.",

        "Authors": "By Breyer, Chloe",
        "Description": "Set in the context of the Church Year, The Close is an enthralling account of one young woman's spiritual journey. It is both a personal meditation on faith, in the spirit of Kathleen Norris's Cloister Walk, and a fascinating behind-the-scenes story of a graduate student's first year, in the mode of Scott Turow's One L. Raised in a liberal, interfaith home, Breyer, responding to an inner call to a spiritual vocation, began her training at New York's General Theological Seminary in 1997. She describes her intense immersion in daily prayer, the rigors and rewards of the academic program, and the challenging tension between secular and spiritual that marks her training, including working as a chaplain at Bellevue Hospital. She probes the day-to-day meanings of such profound issues as exaltation, enlightenment, and redemption, illuminating the unique experience of a young person of faith preparing to live and hoping to thrive in a secular modern world.",

As Ramona struggles with Mae's abuse and her own hatred for the foster children, she also tries to keep at bay a powerful attraction she has for her boyfriend's father.Diane McKinney-Whetstone richly evokes the early 1960s in west Philadelphia in this spicy story of loss and healing, redemption and love.",

        "Title": "Theories of Everything: The Quest for Ultimate Explanation",
        "Authors": "By Barrow, John D.",
        "Description": "In books such as The World Within the World and The Anthropic Cosmological Principle, astronomer John Barrow has emerged as a leading writer on our efforts to understand the universe.  Timothy Ferris, writing in The Times Literary Supplement of London, described him as \"a temperate and accomplished humanist, scientist, and philosopher of science--a man out to make a contribution, not a show.\"  Now Barrow offers the general reader another fascinating look at modern physics, as he explores the quest for a single, unifying theory that will unlock nature's secrets.     Theories of Everything is more than a history of science, more than a popular report on recent research and discoveries.  Barrow provides a reflective, intelligent commentary on what a true Theory of Everything would be--its ingredients, its limitations, and what it could tell us about the universe.  Never before, he writes, have physicists been so confident and so eager in the hunt for this \"cosmic Rosetta Stone,\" as he calls it: \"a single all-embracing picture of all the laws of nature from which the inevitability of all things seen must follow with unimpeachable logic.\"  He lays out eight essential ingredients for a Theory of Everything and then explores each in turn, tracing how our knowledge has developed and how scientific discovery relates to our changing philosophy and religious thought in each area.  Some of these ingredients are obvious--the laws of nature must be explained, for example, as well as its organizing principles--but others may be surprising, such as broken symmetries and selection biases.  A Theory of Everything must account for the fact that the universe is \"messy and complicated,\" he tells us, and for the limitations imposed by the questions we ask and the information we can obtain. The key lies in the remarkable capacity of mathematics to express the fundamental workings of the physical world--a language that the human mind is uniquely equipped to understand and manipulate.  Barrow examines what mathematics actually is and describes how it makes the universe intelligible and provides a path to the underlying coherence in nature--which has led, in fact, to arguments that the universe itself is a vast computer.  Yet even the most complete theory, even the most comprehensive mathematical explanation, cannot account for the uncomputable varieties of human experience and thought.  \"No non-poetic account of reality,\" he writes, \"can be complete.\"     In a field where the authorities converse in equations and mathematical notations, John Barrow speaks with the voice of thoughtful and knowledgeable humanist.  Written with eloquence and expertise, Theories of Everything establishes a new perspective on humanity's efforts to explain the universe.",
