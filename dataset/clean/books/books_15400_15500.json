Drawing on years of experience as an obstetrician, and her rare gift for realisn and suspense, Margaret Cuthbert has created a tour de force that will arouse your darkest fears about the greedy side of the business of medicine.  Save the life. Save the life....This is the mantra repeated by Dr. Rae Duprey, Berkeley Hills Hospital's premier obstetrician, who's haunted by the searing memory of her own mother's death in the back of an ambulance -- and driven by a passion to save the lives of women and babies in her care. But when her candidacy for the chairmanship of Berkeley Hills' prestigious obstetrics department is derailed by a series of \"bad baby\" cases emanating from the politically sensitive birth center across the street -- a center run by her ex-lover and nemesis, Bo Michaels -- Rae is determined to uncover the truth about why these seemingly routine deliveries are going totally haywire.  As her investigation unleashes thefirestorm of resistance from all sides, Rae discovers that in the ruthlessly competitive atmosphere of today's health-care system, everyone has a hidden agenda. And that may even include the newest member of the rival cardiac department, a charismatic doctor whose atttractions Rae is finding difficult to resist. As the hair-raising emergenices continue unabated, she begins to suspect the unthinkable: a sinister plan of medical sabotage, masterminded by a killer who is hardly a stanger to Berkeley Hills Hospital....  Combining page-turning suspense, utterly authentic characters, and the most riveting medical emergency scenes to be found anywhere, The Silent Cradle takes the medical thriller into the drama and politics of medicine today, Margaret Cuthbert's talent make for a memorable debut.",

        "Description": "A man learns masculinity primarily from his father. But generations of boys without caring and accepting fathers and mentors grow up modeling themselves after overblown myths of manhood. Obsessed with being \"man enough,\" they become hypermasculine - constantly overcompensating for their lack of a true role model. Chances are they are unable to commit to family life.In the first section of Man Enough, Dr. Frank Pittman discusses men's obsession with masculinity. He describes three common varities of overly masculine men: philanderers, contenders, and controllers. In the second section he examines how masculinity develops and how relationships between fathers and sons are changing as patriarchy wanes and disappears. He looks at mothers and sons, and explores why males without role models may grow up to flee from women. Pittman also examines the changing images of heroes in our culture, which reflect our changing models of masculinity.In the third and last section of the book, Pittman illustrates how a man can move beyond proving his masculinity and into the real life of practicing it. He offers models for masculinity based on teamwork and emulation - striving with the other guys rather than against them. He proposes a masculinity without the fear of women and the need for male dominance, and encourages equality and intimacy with female partners. Finally, Pittman reveals how being a father benefits a man - how a man can rear himself as he rears his children; how he can understand and, if necessary, forgive his parents as he becomes one; and how he can pass on what he has learned about being a man among his peers and an equal partner to a woman.Man Enough moves beyond the spate of men's-movement books toward a new definition of masculinity: it is an original, heartwarming work.",

        "Authors": "By Ornstein, Norman J. (EDT) and Mann, Thomas E.",
        "Description": "In recent years Congress has been in a state of siege. The healthy skepticism that had long characterized public attitudes toward Congress degenerated into corrosive cynicism. The reservoir of support among political elites appears to have collapsed as well. Part of the explanation for this growing public hostility lies in objective conditions: stagnant wages, huge budget deficits, sustained divided government, scandals and deadlock on Capitol Hill. But another important factor may be how Congress is presented to and interpreted for the broader public.This book explores the connections between Congress, the press, and the public. Public opinion scholars analyze historical data to discern trends in and sources of public hostility toward Congress. Media specialists examine patterns of congressional coverage in national print and television news and attitudes toward Congress among producers, editors, and reporters. And students of Congress explore the tools and techniques leaders and rank-and-file members use in presenting themselves and their institution to the public. The book concludes by assessing the role the media plays in presenting Congress to the public and what the media and Congress might do to improve public understanding.The contributors are Herb Asher and Michael Barr, Ohio State University; Karlyn Bowman and Kimberly Coursen, the American Enterprise Institute; Ronald D. Elving, Congressional Quarterly; Stephen Hess, Brookings; Karl Kurtz, National Conference of State Legislatures; Everett Carll Ladd, The Roper Center; Robert Lichter, Center for Media and Public Policy; and Mark J. Rozell, Mary Washington College.This book is the third in a series by the Renewing Congress Project, a joint effort of the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution. The previous volumes are Renewing Congress: A First Report and Renewing Congress: A Second Report.",

        "Description": "The surprising success of Pirates of the Caribbean, a new screen adaptation of the classic Peter Pan, and the Russell Crowe film Master and Commander have fueled interest in seagoing swashbucklers. There is a rich literature on pirates?both in fiction and nonfiction. This collection offers excerpts from the works of contemporary authors: Patrick O'Brian's riveting account of a sea battle with Borneo's pirates will enthrall his fans; Farley Mowat's The Black Joke is a rousing adventure of the rum-running set in the 1930s and written in the tradition of the great classic pirate tales. Readers will also discover and rediscover the most infamous pirates of yore, from Treasure Island's Long John Silver to Peter Pan's Captain Hook. They'll encounter pirate adventures from neglected classics such as L. Frank Baum's Pirates in Oz, Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo and Rafael Sabatini's Captain Blood. And they'll find accounts of the dastardly deeds of female pirates both real (Anne Bonney and Mary Read) and imagined (Arthur Ransome's Chinese pirate Miss Lee). Pirates also draws upon colorful true-life accounts and authentic first-person narratives of pirates?and their victims?discovered in nearly forgotten works such as The Pirates Own Book and Captured by Pirates.",

Some forty years later, the lovers are reunited, and Cavanagh is abruptly confronted with his and the Principessa's son, a bishop born out of wedlock, high in the hierarchy of the Vatican.Brilliantly interweaving past and present, the author creates an epiphanic tale of transcendent love, the crowning achievement of an illustrious career.",

The eternal questions of science and religion were profoundly recast by Einstein's theory of relativity and its implications that time can be warped by motion and gravitation, and that it cannot be meaningfully divided into past, present, and future.  In About Time, Paul Davies discusses the big bang theory, chaos theory, and the recent discovery that the universe appears to be younger than some of the objects in it, concluding that Einstein's theory provides only an incomplete understanding of the nature of time. Davies explores unanswered questions such as:  * Does the universe have a beginning and an end? * Is the passage of time merely an illusion? * Is it possible to travel backward -- or forward -- in time?  About Time weaves physics and metaphysics in a provocative contemplation of time and the universe.",

Finally, he analyzes campaigns of the recent past - including the Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf wars - to show how troop mobility and guerrilla tactics have assumed paramount importance in military strategy.Alexander's argument, based on clear-eyed analysis and careful extrapolations from past successes and failures, is a blueprint for American policy. In the post-Cold War period, we must fight only those battles in which our ends can be achieved quickly and effectively.",

While unidentified bodies routinely make their way to the medical examiner's office, what piques Jack's curiosity is not so much this body's missing head, hands, and feet, but its missing liver.Aided by his colleague Dr. Laurie Montgomery, Jack identifies the corpse as the missing Franconi, but this positive identification in no way solves the mystery. Who killed Carlo Franconi? And was the triggerman responsible for the theft of Franconi's body and its eventual mutilation?",

        "Authors": "By Weil, Andrew",
        "Description": "At last, a book about eating (and eating well) for health -- from Dr. Andrew Weil, the brilliantly innovative and greatly respected doctor who has been instrumental in transforming the way Americans think about health. Now Dr. Weil -- whose nationwide best-sellers Spontaneous Healing and Eight Weeks to Optimum Health have made us aware of the body's capacity to heal itself -- provides us with a program for improving our well-being by making informed choices about how and what we eat.\u00a0\u00a0He gives us all the basic facts about human nutrition. Here is everything we need to know about fats, protein, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins, and their effects on our health.He equips us to make decisions about the latest miracle diet or reducing aid. At the heart of his book, he presents in easy-to-follow detail his recommended OPTIMUM DIET, including complete weekly menus for use both at home and in restaurants.He provides eighty-five recipes accompanied by a rigorous and reliable nutritional breakdown -- delicious recipes reminding us that we can eat for health without giving up the essential pleasures of eating.Customized dietary advice is included for dozens of common ailments, among them asthma, allergies, heart disease, migraines, and thyroid problems. Dr. Weil helps us to read labels on all food products and thereby become much wiser consumers. Throughout he makes clear how an optimal diet can both supply the basic needs of the body and fortify the body's defenses and mechanisms of healing. And he always stresses that good food -- and the good feeling it engenders at the table -- is not only a delight but also necessary to our well-being, so that eating for health means enjoyable eating.In sum, a hugely practical and inspiring book about food, diet, and nutrition that stands to change -- for the better and the healthier -- our most fundamental ideas about eating.",
