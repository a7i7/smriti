The world is full of women who can inspire other women: women who overcome seemingly impossible difficulties, women who follow their dreams into uncharted territory, women who rise to incredible heights of achievement and success, and women who are mentors on finding spiritual fulfillment, creative expression, and deep personal satisfaction in life. Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Other Women is a collection of short stories, personal anecdotes, inspirational quotes, remembrances, and even comedic oneliners whose purpose is to celebrate what women teach each other. Inspirational lecturer, business consultant, storyteller, and bestselling author BJ Gallagher lets us in on the simple but essential wisdom that women can hold for each other. By sharing the stories about the women she has encountered in all walks of life from clients, coworkers, neighbors, shopkeepers, to mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, grandmothers, and girlfriends, BJ helps reveal truths about the topics most women care about: friendship, love, sex, motherhood, food, body image, and happiness and fulfillment.",

        "Authors": "By Henner, Marilu and Sharon, Ruth Velikovsky",
        "Description": "Nobody wants to raise a brat...but the surest way to do so is by doing too much for and giving too much to your kids. Parents often inadvertently confuse love with overindulgence.  They don't want their children to suffer a moment of frustration or be deprived of any desire.  But in truth, a balance of frustration tolerance and gratification is necessary to become a resilient and responsible adult.Of course, every child is difficult on occasion, but true brats are constantly selfish, demanding, and incapable of listening.  Their parents must regularly plead, cajole, and bargain with them to exert some control.  So what makes a child become a brat in the first place? And what can a parent do--or not do--to keep their children from becoming brats?Since being a mother is her most important role, renowned actress Marilu Henner has often turned to Dr. Ruth Sharon, a highly respected psychoanalyst, for advice on raising her own children.  Together, in I Refuse to Raise a Brat, they have created a practical and accessible guidebook based on Dr. Sharon's fundamental observation: Adults with the greatest emotional difficulties were generally overgratified, overprotected, and overindulged as children.Consequently, parents need to allow their children to work through their frustrations at an early age and not consistently indulge them.  I Refuse to Raise a Brat will show parents how to: Establish parent--child contracts and effective methods of discipline Handle temper tantrums, bedtime issues, sibling rivalry, lying, and moreHelp their children tolerate frustration and become comfortable with difficult feelingsFilled with dozens of real-life questions, practical advice, and humorous anecdotes, I Refuse to Raise a Brat is a witty and uniquely helpful resource to help parents raise secure and self-reliant children.",

But as they make their way collecting amid Yellowstone\u2019s beauty, the group is splintered by differing views on science, nature, and economics.

        "Title": "The Visionary's Handbook: Nine Paradoxes That Will Shape the Future of Your Business",
        "Authors": "By Taylor, Jim, Means, Howard B., and Wacker, Watts",
        "Description": "Building upon the Age of Possibility first espoused in their provocative and acclaimed The 500 Year Delta, Watts Wacker and Jim Taylor now welcome readers to the Age of Uncertainty, where, because life has never been easier, it has never been more difficult.In this unprecedented new book, Wacker and Taylor present a vision of the present and future that goes beyond all the chaos and complexity of our times.  With a clear and firm grasp of their material, they proceed to chart a method for readers to create a personal course for the future. This navigational route is premised upon the authors' profound understanding of nine mind-boggling paradoxes that capture the imponderables of modern life, and define the business and social climates of the world as we move forward into the new millennium:The Paradox of the Visionary The closer your vision gets to a provable truth, the more you are simply describing the present.  In the same way, the more certain you are of a future outcome, the more likely you will be wrong.The Paradox of Value The value of any product becomes inseparable from a buyer's perception of worth.  Instead of intrinsic value, we have relative value only--the products that a business makes bear diminished relations to the physical content of the offering.The Paradox of Size The bigger you are, the smaller you need to be.  The Paradox of Time To succeed in the short term, you need to think in the long term.  Yet the greater your vision and the longer the time interval over which you predict results, the greater the risk that you will be unable to take the necessary steps in the short term to achieve the long-term goals.  The tension between short- and long-term planning has never been more tormented.The Paradox of Competition Your biggest competitor is your own view of your future; competition comes from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The Paradox of Action You've got to go for what you can't expect to get; nothing will turn out exactly as it's supposed to.  You must act intuitively and be equally ready to take resolute counter-intuitive action. The Paradox of Leadership To lead from the front, you have to stay inside the story.  In an inherently inconsistent world, consistency is not the virtue it once was in our leaders.The Paradox of Leisure Play is hard work; play and work are blending and becoming indistinguishable. The Paradox of Reality Every person on planet Earth today has the potential to be connected to every other person, and every single one of us inhabits a world of our own and is a marketing segment of absolutely one.  As our links become stronger, our individuation becomes starker.A bold, incisive book, The Visionary's  Handbook  captures the interlocking web o paradoxes that abound in everyday business life, and provides an essential map to help make the future work for every individual and every company in the challenging and uncertain times ahead.",

        "Description": "\"We are not the sum of our possessions. They are not the measures of our lives. In our hearts, we know what matters. We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend; a loving parent; a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood, and town better than he found it.\" -- from President George H. W. Bush's Inaugural  Address, January 21, 1989A charming collection of excerpts from the former president's speeches and other writings, Heartbeat reveals the basic ideals and beliefs that have served George H. W. Bush throughout his public and private life. He speaks often of what he calls \"heartbeat.\" It is a simple word -- a code word -- referring to personal bedrock values concerning service, duty, honor, friends, faith, and particularly family.As the Bushes prove themselves to be one of the most important political families in U.S. history, this warm and revealing look into the former president's guiding principles could not come at a more important time. Culled from Mr. Bush's speeches over the course of his presidency and beyond, Heartbeat discloses a surprising personal side to the forty-first president -- a warm, witty, and expressive man.In chapters such as \"1989: A New Breeze\" and \"1993-2001: Did It with Honor,\" the book features entertaining, eloquent, and emotional excerpts from the former president's words...\"Sure we must change, but some values are timeless. I believe in families that stick together, and fathers who stick around. I happen to believe very deeply in the worth of each individual human being, born or unborn. I believe in teaching our kids the difference between what's wrong and what's right, teaching them respect for hard work and to love their neighbors. I believe that America will always have a special place in God's heart, as long as He has a special place in ours....\"\"Being president does have its advantages. And this is true: I have a TV set there in the White House with five screens, one big one in the middle, four small ones around it. Now I don't have to miss the nightly news when I watch Wheel of Fortune.\"In this single, remarkable collection, Mr. Bush's speeches, interviews, and other statements paint a poig-nant portrait not just of the former president but of a man and a family.",

Supernanny, is the answer to every stressed-out parent's dreams. In ABC's upcoming primetime TV series by the same name, Jo works miracles on problem children by dispensing hard-won wisdom and reassuring us that parents really do know best. The Supernanny method gives parents the know-how to tackle problem areas such as mealtime, bath time, bedtime, bedwetting, homework, sibling rivalry, aggressive behavior, or a child who just won't do what he or she is told to do.Divided into action-oriented problem and solution sections, Supernanny will show parents how to restore harmony and authority in the home using the Supernanny's ten basic rules and her effective, no-nonsense approach to problem-solving. For example:Problem: What if your child refuses to go to bed? Supernanny Solution: Develop a bedtime routine so that the child can get used to a consistent pattern that she is not going to be able to change or manipulate. A routine will set up a calming sequence of events that will be designed to help the child relax.Problem: Toilet-training Supernanny Solution: Prepare your child by taking any hint of shame or disgust out of what is simply a natural fact of life. Keep the door open, bring her into the bathroom with you, and explain what's happening, including the use of toilet paper and the washing of hands afterward.",

Using definitive original language texts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, biblical scholars of L'\u00c9cole Biblique in Jerusalem produced a meticulously accurate, wonderfully readable French translation of the complete canon of Scripture (La Bible de J\u00e9rusalem). From this French original came the English edition, edited by renowned Bible scholar Alexander Jones.For all the people around the world who are discovering or revisiting the mysteries contained in the Scriptures, only a clear, understandable Bible translation will do.

In Unlucky for Some, her thirteenth book featuring Detective Chief Inspectors Lloyd and Hill, the quiet life of an English town scarcely conceals the deadly menace lurking around dark corners and within the human mind.Michael Waterman is a self-made millionaire. His casinos and nightclubs ensure a constant flow of cash, and Waterman knows what he needs to do to keep it that way. So far, it seems, he has stayed on the right side of the law. Certainly, no one seriously suspects him of murdering bingo player Wilma Fenton, who was struck down while walking home with a purse crammed full of winnings. Her murder looks like an ordinary mugging except for one oddity: The killer had left Wilma\u2019s money neatly fanned out across her body.The motive behind the bafflingly violent act dogs Lloyd and Hill\u2013 now married and the harried parents of a two-year-old daughter. The stakes are raised with a second murder, modeled on the first . . . and then a third. A cold-blooded killer is challenging not only the police but the one witness to the first slaying: England\u2019s premier expert on serial crime, well-known journalist and TV personality, Tony Baker. It has now become a twisted game of madness and logic\u2013in which failure to outwit the murderer means more senseless deaths.In this astonishing Lloyd and Hill novel, Jill McGown\u2019s storytelling genius will captivate longtime fans as well as first-time readers.

        "Description": "When we first blasted our way into space a generation ago, we did so with men from each of the superpowers. Women were excluded from one of the most exciting adventures of the century-and not because they weren't up to the challenge. In 1962, three accomplished female pilots took their case before the U.S. Congress, but they were dismissed as unpatriotic. We were in a Cold War-a space race-and NASA had already chosen the Mercury Seven to represent America. In Almost Heaven, acclaimed writer Bettyann Kevles gives voice to the women of the space age-women who had the \"right stuff,\" but had to struggle to prove it. Through intensive interviews and meticulous research, Kevles illuminates what makes these women tick. What were their unique concerns as female astronauts? Were they truly accepted into the astronaut corps, or were they merely \"tokens\"? She also poses a question that will affect generations to come: Is NASA preparing women as well as men for travel beyond Earth's orbit, or is the research still biased toward men?The stories of these forty women, told here for the first time in rich and colorful detail, explore the convergence of culture and science-and suggest the battle is far from over.",

        "Description": "As a musician who is also a writer, Ned Rorem claims that some years ago the IRS, at a loss as to how to pigeonhole him for their purposes, settled on the designation of \"Other Entertainment\" when noting the source of his livelihood. Thus the title of this fourteenth book by a composer who has been universally acclaimed for his prose, and a writer who has won a Pulitzer Prize for his music.He goes beyond music in this collection, however, reaching in some instances even beyond \"entertainment.\" These essays examine in depth such contrasting human subjects as Billie Holiday and Arnold Schoenberg, Lillian Hellman and Kazuo Ishiguro, Benjamin Britten and Josephine Baker, Noel Coward and Marguerite Duras, Joe Orton and Jean Cocteau. And in addition to the reviews, profiles, tributes, and even obituaries, there are dialogues with critic John Simon and with physician Lawrence Mass that center on homosexuality, as it obtains both in the arts and in general conversation.Two pieces about new American opera, and one on the old chestnut Carmen, demonstrate yet again Ned Rorem's informed wit on a subject near to his heart. Even nearer his heart are portraits of cherished colleagues Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland, and Virgil Thomson, plus snapshots of still more friends and idols, from Debussy, Ravel, and Sarah Orne Jewett to Myrna Loy, Libby Holman, and Jane Bowles.Finally Rorem paints very personal and impressionistic landscapes of the artists' colony Yaddo, of Carnegie Hall, and of Nantucket island.",

        "Authors": "By Aaron, Henry J. and Reischauer, Robert D.",
        "Description": "With baby-boomer retirement drawing nearer, Social Security, long a \"third rail\" in American politics, has become fair game. When President Clinton launched national discussion in April on the future of the program, the loudest voices seemed to belong to those who claimed the system would go \"bankrupt\" and argued for scrapping it in favor of a privatized plan. Is the nation's premier social insurance program on the brink of collapse? In this book, two of the nation's most widely respected economists argue that the \"Chicken Little\" view of Social Security--that future costs doom the current system--is so exaggerated that it is just plain wrong. Certainly, the retirement of the baby boom generation will require some adjustments, but they need be no greater in type or size than adjustments the government has adopted to deal with the overall budget deficit. The book provides the historical background of the economic circumstances that different generations have faced in this century and shows how changes in Social Security has affected life in America. The authors also analyze the economic assumptions underlying current reform efforts, closely scrutinizing the increasingly popular proposals to privatize Social Security by transforming it from an insurance program to a system of individual retirement accounts.",

        "Description": "A darkly comic novel from the author of Blonde and We Were the Mulvaneys   In Salthill-on-Hudson, a half-hour train ride from Manhattan, everyone is rich, beautiful, and -- though they look much younger -- middle-age. But when Adam Berendt, a charismatic, mysterious sculptor, dies suddenly in a brash act of heroism, shock waves rock the town. But who was Adam Berendt? Was he in fact a hero, or someone more flawed and human? His loss and the rumor that surface of his possible lovers plunge his friends into grief, confusion, and self-reflection. The women who loved Adam find themselves engaging in life-altering romantic adventures. The men who were Adam's closest friends become utterly transformed in his absence. Adam's lawyer, Roger Cavenagh, who has broken the law for Adam's sake, becomes invlolve with an elusive and perhaps treacherous young woman. Marina Troy exiles herself to fullfill a wish Adam had made for her. Lionel Hoffman sets out, unwisely but with great hope, to recapture his lost youth after a lifetime of soulless financial success, even as his wife, Camille, discovers an unspeckable joy close to home. Augusta Cutler, a hitherto sensuous, unreflective woman defiantly endeavors to solve the mystery of Adam's origins, even if it means losing her marriage and family. Middle Age: A Romance is an intimately drawn, richly sympathetic, yet unsparingly comic portrait of the affluent class at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Incisive, insightful, and never predictable, it's a uniquely American sage of self-determination and identity from one of our finest writers of contemporary fiction.",

        "Description": "With acerbic wit, irreverent tone, and bountiful hilarious anecdotes,  Jay McInerney writes the first wine book that makes sense to all those  dazed by the prevailing, dull technical wine writing. McInerney  generously reveals all he's learned on his worldwide journey to  understand wine in chapters on reds, whites, dessert wines, champagne,  aperitifs, and more.  McInerney holds forth in forty-nine essays - with  agile humor; an astonishing amount of hard fact, and an ample dose of  personal taste - on: how to make your way around a German wine label;  what to drink with Thanksgiving turkey; the truth about Zinfandels; why  Burgundy is so hard to predict; Napa Valley's finest winemakers; the  pleasure of flinty Chablis, the deep satisfaction of port, the glorious  potential of Oregon's Pinot Noir; the respectability of RosT; and the  most colorful characters in the business. It is actually possible for a  reader of Bacchus & Me to take what is learned to the bank, and  immediately thereafter to wine shop or restaurant to indulge in the wine  of his or her fantasy with the confidence of a sommelier. Bacchus &  Me is for everyone interested in learning more about the wines of the  world. For both those of broad means and of modest purse, there is  intense vicarious pleasure to be found in McInerney's vinous adventures.",

No one who has lips will be able to read it without smiling; it's guaranteed.The fact is, we all have our bad days-they are an intrinsic part of being human. As prescribed by The Blue Day Book in its delightful photo and text messages, the solution is to see each incident in perspective, recognize that our feelings of failure and loss are not unique, acknowledge the absurdities of our existence, and glory in the potential we all have. In less than 100 sentences, The Blue Day Book conveys this message with great compassion and humor. Its vehicle is charming black-and-white photographs of animals that are strangely human and completely free of judgment or pretension. The humble marriage of easy text and beautiful images takes the reader through the entire evolution of a blue day, examines what it feels like, what causes it, and how to get over it.",

A former prosecutor, and now the respected partner of a prestigious law firm, he has the means and the knowledge to kill without leaving a trace of evidence behind.His targets are criminals themselves, sexual predators beyond reform. He has no connection to them; he simply finds their names in public records. But Jack knows firsthand the devastation these depraved monsters leave in their wake - his own fifteen-year-old daughter was herself a victim. And he's determined to save others from the same excruciating pain.A thousand miles away, FBI agent Amanda Lee has carefully balanced motherhood with her meteoric career as one of the agency's brightest and bravest experts in her field. Then a botched investigation rocks Amanda's life as well as her career, and she is assigned to a case some people don't want to see solved. Following the trail of the man who is stalking sex offenders across the country, Amanda is unaware that her past is catching up with her and that she - and her children - are in the gravest danger.As Jack carefully, methodically, and brutally exacts his own brand of justice, Amanda closes the gap between them. But in an astounding twist of fate, their lives are about to fall into each other's hands. Before the hunt is over, they will have to choose together: between deliverance and destruction, and between the ultimate right and wrong.",

Now he is just another kriegie (\"war captured\") at the fiercely guarded Stalag Luft 13 in Bavaria.Then routine comes to a halt with the arrival of a new prisoner: First Lieutenant Lincoln Scott, an African American Tuskegee airman who instantly becomes the target of contempt from his fellow soldiers. His most notable adversary is Vincent Bedford, a decorated bomber captain from Mississippi. The hatred between the two men is as volatile as a grenade ready to be detonated.When a prisoner is brutally murdered, and all the blood-soaked evidence points to Scott, Hart is tapped to defend the soldier, who steadfastly claims his innocence. Yet from the start, Hart senses he has been chosen merely to make a show of defending the accused in what is presumed to be an open-and-shut case.In a trial rife with racial tension and raw conflict, where the lines between ally and enemy blur, there are those with their own secret motives - and a burning passion for a rush to judgment; no matter the cost.",
