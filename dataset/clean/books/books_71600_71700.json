        "Authors": "By Kinsolving, William",
        "Description": "A novelist with the rare ability to grant us entree to whispered-about realms of privilege and glamour, William Kinsolving now tells the story of a remarkable woman who fights to triumph over the ambitious men who dominate foreign affairs. Through her eyes we are given a candid, insider's account of the intrigue-filled game of diplomacy as it is played in exciting international capitals and dangerous trouble spots - a game in which the rules are constantly changing and even a savvy diplomat's daughter might not know them all.Her father a lifelong U.S. Foreign Service officer, Lily McCann follows in his footsteps reluctantly, knowing that his ideals clash with the State Department's cynical ways - and that her progress may be slowed by its entrenched men's-club attitudes. Even her relationship with the brilliant Worth Deloit, the State Department's rising star, holds its perils, as his loyalties seem to go no further than his own career. And throughout, as Lily is posted in exotic locales and takes on sensitive assignments, she is haunted by the memory of a brutal act of terrorism she witnessed as a teenager - one that has its final consequences in an explosive confrontation in one of the world's most volatile regions.Involving and fast-paced, The Diplomat's Daughter is both an unforgettable picture of an astonishing woman and an entertaining education in how peace is waged. It leaves no doubt as to why William Kinsolving is the class of his field, a writer who has mastered an irresistible blend of worldly perception and absorbing drama.",

        "Description": "Today more than ever, international headlines are dominated by dispatches from the many dictatorships that still dot the globe. Although Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein has been deposed, North Korea's Kim Jong-il continues to attract attention on the world stage; at the same time, other dictatorships, led by royal families, military juntas, and single political parties, persist in repressing and brutalizing their citizens without ever attracting anything like Saddam's or Kim Jong-il's level of international attention.In this fascinating, eye-opening read, New York Times bestselling author David Wallechinsky offers in-depth portraits of each of the twenty worst dictators -- and the governments they head -- currently in power: exposing their crimes, and revealing their strange personalities and mysterious backgrounds. Tyrants also reveals the extent that foreign corporations and governments support these tyrants despite their policies.Timely and provocative, crafted with the popular touch that has made Wallechinsky a bestselling author, Tyrants will awaken you to the criminal regimes of the present -- and pose challenging questions about America's role in curbing (or promoting) their power in the future.The Tyrant Hall of Shame includes:Kim Jong-il/North KoreaHu Jintao/ChinaSeyed Ali Khamenei/IranKing Abdullah/Saudi Arabia Muammar al-Qaddafi/LibyaOmar al-Bashir/SudanIslam Karimov/UzbekistanSaparmurat Niyazov/Turkmenistan Fidel Castro/Cuba",

        "Title": "U.S. Submarines Since 1945: An Illustrated Design History",
        "Authors": "By Friedman, Norman and Christley, James L. (ILT)",
        "Description": "The role of U.S. submarines is currently the focus of an intense debate, and this book contributes to that discussion in the belief that an understanding of the past is necessary to make wise decisions about the future. In the tradition of his acclaimed warship design history series. Norman Friedman describes the forces technical, political, and operational that shaped a vital element of U.S. sea power. For example, he examines the evolution in missions, such as forward-based antisubmarine warfare and strategic deterrence, that transformed the submarine from its former subsidiary role to the center of national power. U.S. Submarines since 1945 is also the story of a technological revolution: first the emergence of fast diesel-electric craft, then the shock of nuclear power, followed by the appearance of submarine-launched strategic missiles. Nowhere else can a reader find so complete or sophisticated an account of the development of the U.S. submarine force, including not only the hulls but also the weapons and sensors they carry. The book details what submarines were ordered, what weapons and propulsion systems they had, how they performed, and what sonars and combat systems were developed.This volume also publicly reveals for the first time several important proposals for unrealized and generally unknown submarine projects. Drawing heavily on interviews with members of the submarine community. Friedman examines a radically changing defense environment. His detailed and authoritative study also takes a look at the effects posed by the end of the Cold War on the role and construction of submarine fleets. The book explores the challenges involved in the often necessary reinvention of a submarine to meet current and projected needs. The author compares the technical requirements of submarines versus surface ships and discusses the importance of maintaining a submarine industrial base in the face of post-Cold War reductions.",

Linden Avery, who loved Thomas Covenant and watched him die, has returned to the Land in search of her kidnapped son, Jeremiah. As Fatal Revenant begins, Linden watches from the battlements of Revelstone when the impossible happens- riding ahead of the hordes attacking Revelstone are Jeremiah and Covenant himself, apparently very much alive.  Here in the Land, Jeremiah is healed of the mental condition that had kept him mute and unresponsive for so many years. He is full of life, and devoted to Covenant. But Covenant is strangely changed. Sarcastic and bragging, he no longer seems like the man whom Linden adored. And yet he says he has a plan: he will take her and Jeremiah to a place where they can find a pure source of Earthpower and, after he has achieved his own purposes, Linden will be free to use that great power to go home, to take Jeremiah home, or to do anything else she sees fit. Even though she distrusts the seemingly different man he has now become, how can she make any choice except to follow him?  Their journey will cover unimaginable distances through the Land-even through time itself-and will test Linden's courage again and again. In the end, fulfilling her destiny will call for a terrible leap of faith: Can she give up everything she thought had been restored to her, for the sake of the Land?",

        "Description": "Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy loathed each other. Their antagonism, propelled by clashing personalities, contrasting views, and a deep, abiding animosity, would drive them to a bitterness so deep that even civil conversation was often impossible. Played out against the backdrop of the turbulent 1960s, theirs was a monumental political battle that would shape federal policy, fracture the Democratic party, and have a lasting effect on the politics of our times. Drawing on previously unexamined recordings and documents, as well as memoirs, biographies, and scores of personal interviews, Jeff Shesol weaves the threads of this epic story into a compelling narrative that reflects the impact of LBJ and RFK's tumultuous relationship on politics, civil rights, the war on poverty, and the war in Vietnam. As Publishers Weekly noted, \"This is indispensable reading for both experts on the period and newcomers to the history of that decade.\" \"An exhaustive and fascinating history. . . . Shesol's grasp of the era's history is sure, his tale often entertaining, and his research awesome.\"\u2014Russell Baker, New York Review of Books \"Thorough, provocative. . . . The story assumes the dimensions of a great drama played out on a stage too vast to comprehend.\"\u2014Jonathan Yardley, Washington Post (1997 Critic's Choice) \"This is the most gripping political book of recent years.\"\u2014Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. A New York Times Notable Book of the Year",

        "Description": "Latin America's Foremost Political Journalist Makes a Brilliant and Passionate Argument for Real Reform In the Economically Crippled Continent In Liberty for Latin America, Alvaro Vargas Llosa offers an incisive diagnosis of Latin America's woes--and a prescription for finally getting the region on the road to both genuine prosperity and the protection of human rights.  When the economy in Argentina--at one time a model of free-market reform--collapsed in 2002, experts of all persuasions asked: What went wrong? Vargas Llosa shows that what went wrong in Argentina has in fact gone wrong all over the continent for over five hundred years. He explains how the republics of the nineteenth century and the revolutions of the twentieth-populist uprisings, Marxist coops, state takeovers, and First World-sponsored privatization-have all run up against the oligarchic legacy of statism. Illiberal elites backed by the United States and Europe have perpetuated what he calls the \"five principles of oppression\" in order to maintain their hold on power. The region has become \"a laboratory for political and economic suicide,\" while comparable countries in Asia and Eastern Europe have prospered.      The only way to change things in Latin America, Vargas Llosa argues, is to remove the five principles of oppression, genuinely reforming institutions and the underlying culture for the benefit of the disempowered public. In Liberty for Latin America, he explains how, offering hope as well as insight for all those who care for the future of this troubled region.",

It is here that Rebecca Moray comes to research a book on Irish knitting. With her daughter, Rowan, accompanying her, she hopes to lose herself in the history of the island and forget her own painful past. Soon, the townsfolk's warm embrace wraps Rebecca and Rowan in a world of friendship, laughter, and love. And it is here that young Rowan befriends Sean Morahan, a cantankerous old fisherman, despite his attempts to scare her off. As Rebecca watches her daughter interact with Morahan, she recognizes in his eyes a look that speaks of a dark knowledge not unlike her own. And when current storms threaten to resurrect old ones, Morahan and Rebecca find themselves on a collision course-with Rowan caught between them-each buffeted by waves of regret and recrimination. Only by walking headfirst into the winds will they find the faith to forgive without forgetting...and reach the shore.",

The recipes encompass much more than seafood and include all of the ingredients\u2014meat, poultry, game, fruits and vegetables in abundance\u2014that have made the coastal parts of America particularly rich in culinary traditions.Come along with John Shields to a New England clambake (complete with instructions on how to make an authentic one on a beach), dig into Cheese and Garlic Grits with Shrimp and Tasso Gravy in Baton Rouge, sample Savannah She-Crab Soup, savor California Cobb Salad or Big Apple Clam Chowder, and finish off with a luscious Dulce de Leche Bread Pudding.This treasury of the very best recipes from professional chefs and local folks alike will expand your culinary horizons.  His voyage of discovery led John Shields to the heart of Miami, both Little Haiti and Little Havana, where he learned the secrets of Haitian-Style flounder from Miss Liliane Nerette Louis, a vibrant neighborhood personality, as well as the Arroz con Pollo a la Cubano from chef Tony Piedra at the renowned Versailles restaurant.  In Oregon, John visited Tillamook County, where the cows outnumber the people, and sampled their famous cheddar in Tillamook Cheddar Cheese and Lager Soup, then ventured north to Blake Island, across the bay from Seattle, where he took part in the native American tradition that celebrates the wild Pacific salmon with an annual roast.  He re-creates the experience for home cooks with a planked salmon recipe from Portland\u2019s acclaimed Wildwood restaurant.  On the Louisiana bayou, he uncovered the trick to a proper Crawdaddy Boil, then hopped a plane to Hawaii, where he found a recipe for a succulent stew using oxtails or lamb shanks and just three other ingredients that has become a part of his personal repertoire.  Along the way, he collected beloved recipes for hometown favorites across the country\u2014Boston-Style Baked Beans, South of the Mason-Dixon Line Cornbread, Bayou Seafood Gumbo, and many, many more.  The companion volume to the television series, Coastal Cooking with John Shields will give you everything you need to bring the bountiful flavors found along America\u2019s coastline into your own kitchen.",

        "Title": "That Dorky Homemade Look: Quilting Lessons From a Parallel Universe",
        "Authors": "By Boyer, Lisa",
        "Description": "Fed up with feeling like you can't meet the standards of the Quilt Police? Do you want to quilt for comfort and pleasure -- and not to win some high-falutin' quilting contest? Weary of worrying about what others will think of your color choices -- or your pieced points? Or your applique stitches? That Dorky Homemade Look: Quilting Lessons from a Parallel Universe is the quilting companion you've been wishing for.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lisa Boyer, a popular columnist for Quilting Today magazine, gives you permission to quilt because you love it. She clears your path of all those merciless judgments pronounced by the Quilting Queens. She invites you to make quilts that are full of life. This funny book offers these nine principles for the 20 million quilters in America:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Pretty fabric is not acceptable. Go right back to the quilt shop and exchange it for something you feel sorry for.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Realize that patterns and templates are only someone's opinion and should be loosely translated. Personally, I've never thought much of a person who could only make a triangle with three sides.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. When choosing a color plan for your quilt, keep in mind that the colors will fade after a hundred years or so. This being the case, you will need to start with really bright colors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4. You should plan on cutting off about half your triangle or star points. Any more than that is showing off.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5. If you are doing applique, remember that bigger is dorkier. Flowers should be huge. Animals should possess really big eyes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6. Throw away your seam ripper and repeat after me: \"Oops. Oh, no one will notice.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7. Plan on running out of border fabric when you are three-quarters of the way finished. Complete the remaining border with something else you have a lot of, preferably in an unrelated color family.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8. You should be able to quilt equally well in all directions. I had to really work on this one. It was difficult to make my forward stitching look as bad as my backward stitching, but closing my eyes helped.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9. When you have put your last stitch in the binding, you are still only half finished. Your quilt must now undergo a thorough conditioning. Give it to someone you love dearly&#151;to drag around the house, wrap up in, spill something on, and wash and dry until it is properly lumpy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"No reason not to have quiltmaking be a pleasure\", says Lisa Boyer, who has as firm a grip on her sense of humor as she does on her quilting needles. \"If we didn't make Dorky Homemade quilts, all the quilts in the world would end up in the Beautiful Quilt Museum, untouched and intact. Quilts would just be something to look at. We would forget that quilts are lovable, touchable, shreddable, squeezable, chewable, and huggable -- made to wrap up in when the world seems to be falling down around us.\"",
