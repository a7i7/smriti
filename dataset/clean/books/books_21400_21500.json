        "Title": "The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken",
        "Authors": "By Teachout, Terry",
        "Description": "When H. L. Mencken talked, everyone listened -- like it or not. In the Roaring Twenties, he was the one critic who mattered, the champion of a generation of plain-speaking writers who redefined the American novel, and the ax-swinging scourge of the know-nothing, go-getting middle-class philistines whom he dubbed the \"booboisie.\" Some loved him, others loathed him, but everybody read him. Now Terry Teachout takes on the man Edmund Wilson called \"our greatest practicing literary journalist,\" brilliantly capturing all of Mercken's energy and erudition, passion and paradoxes, in a masterful biography of this iconoclastic figure and the world he shaped.From his carefree days as a teenage cub reporter in turn-of-the-century Baltimore to his noisy tenure as founding editor of theAmerican Mercury, the most influential magazine of the twenties, Mencken distinguished himself with a contrary spirit, a razor-sharp wit (he coined the term \"Bible Belt\"), and a keen eye for such up-and-coming authors as Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Willa Cather, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. He covered everything, from the Scopes evolution trial to the 1948 presidential elections, in the pages of the BaltimoreSun. He wrote bestselling books about the failure of democracy, the foibles of the female sex, and what he memorably called \"the American language.\" But his favorite topic was the one he saw wherever he looked: the sterile, life-denying strain of puritanism that he believed was strangling the culture of his native land.No modern writer has been more controversial than H. L. Mencken. His fans saw him as the fearless leader of the endless battle against ignorance and hypocrisy, while his enemies dismissed him as a cantankerous, self-righteous ideologue. The surging popularity of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the politician he hated most, eventually caused his star to fade, but the unsparing vigor of his critique of American life and letters -- and the raucously colloquial prose style in which he blasted the Babbitts -- retains its freshness and relevance to this day.Himself an accomplished critic and journalist, Terry Teachout has combed through reams of Mencken's private papers, including the searingly candid autobiographical manuscripts sealed after his death in 1956. Out of this material he has fashioned a portrait of the artist as intellectual gadfly, working newspaperman, devoted husband, and faithless ]over. Meticulously researched, elegantly written, and completely absorbing,The Skeptic vividly evokes the life and legacy of a true American legend.",

And if these were their remains - revealed finally after over seven decades - where were the bones of the two younger Romanovs supposedly murdered with the rest of the family?The Romanovs: The Final Chapter provides the answers, recounting the horrifying moments of slaughter, revealing the guilt of and the cover-up by Lenin and his lieutenants, and then describing in dramatic, suspenseful detail the fascinating and ultimately successful efforts in post-Communist Russia to discover the truth.This unique story, written almost as a detective thriller by Pulitzer Prize winner Robert K. Massie, presents a colorful panorama of contemporary characters - beginning with two enterprising Russians who, against tremendous odds, finally found the secret burial place; documenting the key roles of U.S. secretary of state James Baker, Russian president Boris Yeltsin, and Great Britain's Prince Philip; and reporting the major scientific dispute between Russian experts and a team of Americans, including Drs. William Maples and Michael Baden - fiercely antagonistic forensic experts whose findings, along with those of DNA scientists from Russia, America, and Great Britain, all contributed to, and then resolved, the controversy.",

        "Description": "Forbidden Fruit is a collection of fascinating, largely untold stories of ordinary men and women who took extraordinary measures, risking life and limb to be together. It\u00b9s the story of couples who faced mobs, bloodhounds, bounty hunters, and bullets to defy the system that allowed slave masters to breed and sell people like cattle. Some broke the taboo against interracial marriage, putting their lives in the most severe peril.In one remarkable story, a Georgia couple who fled slavery wearing multiple disguises sailed for England with bounty hunters and federal troops on their trail. A fugitive slave from Virginia spent seventeen arduous years searching for his wife. A Missouri slave fell in love with his white Mormon neighbor and escaped to Canada to be with her, putting pepper in his shoes to throw dogs off the scent at night and hiding in trees by day.Betty DeRamus gleaned these amazing stories from descendants of runaway slave couples, unpublished memoirs, Civil War records, books, magazines, and dozens of previously untapped sources. Beautifully and compassionately written, this important book reveals a chapter of American history that is shameful but is about triumph as well as torture, achievement as well as degradation, and indomitable love as well as hate.",

        "Description": "Did you ever  dream of talking to a mermaid?   Can you imagine facing off with a bully who barely reaches your knees?   What would you do with a box of golden coins?   Have you ever said thank you to...a button?   And how would you respond if you met a magic genie who asked you for a handout instead of granting you a wish?   Free to Be...You and Me creator Marlo Thomas has once again produced a joyful volume for children and the grown-ups in their lives. Reaching into the heads and hearts of our most acclaimed writers, artists, and performers, Thanks & Giving celebrates the best things in life -- family, friendship, giving, thankfulness, and love (and just for fun, a few of their opposites -- stinginess, bullying, ingratitude, and the occasional urge to stamp your feet and throw a fit).   From Tiger Woods and Maurice Sendak to Hilary Duff and Newbery Medalist Kate DiCamillo, this colorful collection of stories, poems, and songs will take readers on a lighthearted and thoughtful (but never overserious) adventure. Whether you're gazing at the brilliant child's-eye paintings of illustrator Eric Carle, or laughing out loud at the off-the-wall humor of Mel Brooks, you'll enjoy every step of the magical journey that the creators of Thanks & Giving have planned for you:   &#149; Delight in Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith's fractured fable starring a mouse, a bird, and a sausage who learn all about sharing -- the hard way.   &#149; Hold on tight as Rosie Perez recounts the tale of a little girl confronted with a heart-stopping decision.   &#149; Rock along with Kevin and Michael Bacon's funky valentine to sibling rivalry and brotherly love.   &#149; And laugh with Ray Romano as he reveals how his life was changed by a giant burrito.   Designed for both cover-to-cover reading and selective excerpting (when you can't refuse that last impassioned call for \"One more story!\" just before lights-out), this sparkling anthology also includes marvelous contributions from Avi, Shel Silverstein, Tom Chapin, Arthur creator Marc Brown, Matt Groening, Deepak Chopra, Donald Trump, Frankie Muniz, Walter Dean Myers, Paul Newman, Sumner Redstone, Jerry Pinkney, Whoopi Goldberg, Sonia Manzano, the Sesame Street Muppets, Julianne Moore, Ed Koren, Wendy Wasserstein, and Paul O.

        "Title": "Politics Lost: How American Democracy Was Trivialized By People Who Think You're Stupid",
        "Authors": "By Klein, Joe",
        "Description": "People on the right are furious.  People on the left are livid.  And the center isn\u2019t holding. There is only one thing on which almost everyone agrees: there is something very wrong in Washington. The country is being run by pollsters. Few politicians are able to win the voters\u2019 trust. Blame abounds and personal responsibility is nowhere to be found. There is a cynicism in Washington that appalls those in every state, red or blue. The question is: Why? The more urgent question is: What can be done about it?Few people are more qualified to deal with both questions than Joe Klein.There are many loud and opinionated voices on the political scene, but no one sees or writes with the clarity that this respected observer brings to the table. He has spent a lifetime enmeshed in politics, studying its nuances, its quirks, and its decline. He is as angry and fed up as the rest of us, so he has decided to do something about it\u2014in these pages, he vents, reconstructs, deconstructs, and reveals how and why our leaders are less interested in leading than they are in the \u201cpermanent campaign\u201d that political life has become.The book opens with a stirring anecdote from the night of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination. Klein re-creates the scene of Robert Kennedy\u2019s appearance in a black neighborhood in Indianapolis, where he gave a gut-wrenching, poetic speech that showed respect for the audience, imparted dignity to all who listened, and quelled a potential riot. Appearing against the wishes of his security team, it was one of the last truly courageous and spontaneous acts by an American politician\u2014and it is no accident that Klein connects courage to spontaneity. From there, Klein begins his analysis\u2014campaign by campaign\u2014of how things went wrong. From the McGovern campaign polling techniques to Roger Ailes\u2019s combative strategy for Nixon; from Reagan\u2019s reinvention of the Republican Party to Lee Atwater\u2019s equally brilliant reinvention of behind-the-scenes strategizing; from Jimmy Carter to George H. W. Bush to Bill Clinton to George W.\u2014as well as inside looks at the losing sides\u2014we see how the Democrats become diffuse and frightened, how the system becomes unbalanced, and how politics becomes less and less about ideology and more and more about how to gain and keep power. By the end of one of the most dismal political runs in history\u2014Kerry\u2019s 2004 campaign for president\u2014we understand how such traits as courage, spontaneity, and leadership have disappeared from our political landscape.In a fascinating final chapter, the author refuses to give easy answers since the push for easy answers has long been part of the problem.  But he does give thoughtful solutions that just may get us out of this mess\u2014especially if any of the 2008 candidates happen to be paying attention.",

The smart, saucy sleuth featured in all of Carol Higgins Clark's bestselling novels was last seen in Deck the Halls, the holiday thriller Carol wrote with her mother, Mary Higgins Clark. Now Regan is in New York to attend a crime conference organized by her celebrity-author mother. A friend, Thomas Pilsner -- the frenetic president of the Settlers' Club on Gramercy Park -- calls Regan, desperately pleading for help. Thomas is distraught over the sudden suspicious deaths of two members of the Settlers' Club. The men had promised to donate a cache of valuable diamonds to save the Club. But now the diamonds are gone, the men are dead, and Thomas is a mess. He fears the police will suspect he is at the heart of both mysteries, and worse yet, he'll lose his job.  Enter Regan. Who better than the star of Decked, Snagged, Iced, and Twanged to solve the mystery of the missing diamonds and suspicious deaths? Who better to contend with the quirky characters around the Club, such as Lydia Sevatura, the self-styled \"Princess of Love,\" who operates a dating service, and her butler, Maldwin Feckles, who has just opened the first school of butlering in New York City? And who better than Carol Higgins Clark, with her sparkling, canny prose, to keep the readers guessing to the end \"who done it\"?  Published to coincide with the paperback of Deck the Halls, Fleeced is a witty portrait of modern urban life.

        "Title": "Banvard's Folly: Tales of Renowned Obscurity, Famous Anonymity, and Rotten Luck",
        "Authors": "By Collins, Paul",
        "Description": "The historical record crowns success. Those enshrined in its annals are men and women whose ideas, accomplishments, or personalities have dominated, endured, and most important of all, found champions. John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage, Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists, and Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated.Paul Collins' Banvard's Folly is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells.Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as \"The Three Mile Painting\") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. Ren\u00e9 Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed \"William Shakespeare\" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers.Collins' love for what he calls the \"forgotten ephemera of genius\" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in Banvard's Folly sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or p0revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.",

        "Description": "Stylish, convincing, wise, funny\u2013and just in time: the ultimate non-diet book, which could radically change the way you think and live.French women don\u2019t get fat, but they do eat bread and pastry, drink wine, and regularly enjoy three-course meals. In her delightful tale, Mireille Guiliano unlocks the simple secrets of this \u201cFrench paradox\u201d\u2013how to enjoy food and stay slim and healthy. Hers is a charming, sensible, and powerfully life-affirming view of health and eating for our times.As a typically slender French girl, Mireille (Meer-ray) went to America as an exchange student and came back fat. That shock sent her into an adolescent tailspin, until her kindly family physician, \u201cDr. Miracle,\u201d came to the rescue. Reintroducing her to classic principles of French gastronomy plus time-honored secrets of the local women, he helped her restore her shape and gave her a whole new understanding of food, drink, and life. The key? Not guilt or deprivation but learning to get the most from the things you most enjoy. Following her own version of this traditional wisdom, she has ever since relished a life of indulgence without bulge, satisfying yen without yo-yo on three meals a day. Now in simple but potent strategies and dozens of recipes you\u2019d swear were fattening, Mireille reveals the ingredients for a lifetime of weight control\u2013from the emergency weekend remedy of Magical Leek Soup to everyday tricks like fooling yourself into contentment and painless new physical exertions to save you from the StairMaster. Emphasizing the virtues of freshness, variety, balance, and always pleasure, Mireille shows how virtually anyone can learn to eat, drink, and move like a French woman. A natural raconteur, Mireille illustrates her philosophy through the experiences that have shaped her life\u2013a six-year-old\u2019s first taste of Champagne, treks in search of tiny blueberries (called myrtilles) in the woods near her grandmother\u2019s house, a near-spiritual rendezvous with oysters at a seaside restaurant in Brittany, to name but a few. She also shows us other women discovering the wonders of \u201cFrench in action,\u201d drawing examples from dozens of friends and associates she has advised over the years to eat and drink smarter and more joyfully. Here are a culture\u2019s most cherished and time-honored secrets recast for the twenty-first century. For anyone who has slipped out of her zone, missed the flight to South Beach, or accidentally let a carb pass her lips, here is a buoyant, positive way to stay trim. A life of wine, bread\u2013even chocolate\u2013without girth or guilt? Pourquoi pas?",

The 19 contributors are an exceptionally impressive selection of international relations experts, including Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Honorable Cyrus Vance, Lord David Owen, Edward Mortimer, and Kenneth Hackett.  Their essays search for the techniques that can stop disease (conflict) before it is transmitted by making trenchant observations  of the contemporary myths and realities of the world community and the roles that the media, fact finding missions, partnerships, peace-keeping activities, and \"healthy\" alliances might have on the future of peace diplomacy.

        "Authors": "By Sporting News, News, The Sporting",
        "Description": "Among baseball players, few have the respect and adoration that Cal Ripken Jr. has earned throughout his career. With dignity and class, Cal has played on, and on, and on, eclipsing Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games in 1995. And on he went, finally calling the record quits in 1998 and moving into exclusive baseball company with his 400th home run and 3,000th hit. 2001 will mark the end of his extraordinary career, which has been captured in Cal.  The Sporting News, in conjunction with the writers and photographers at The Baltimore Sun, will brings you the commemorative celebration of a celebrated career, from his sensational rookie season in 1983 to his 2001 All-Star Game heroics and his final moment on the field.  Nine chapters recap Ripken's amazing career. The Sporting News  senior writer and former Baltimore Sun  columnist Ken Rosenthal looks at Ripken The Icon, finding Ripken's rightful place in baseball history. The Sun's  Joe Strauss recaps Ripken's final playing days, from his retirement announcement to his final curtain call at Camden Yards to his final game at Yankee Stadium. Other chapters recall Ripken's spine-tingling run into baseball history, Cal's coming of age on the national scene, his mold-breaking play as a shortstop and the role his family, especially his father and brother, played in his career.  It's the ultimate keepsake of a player for the ages.",

        "Title": "County Fairs: Where America Meets",
        "Authors": "By McCarry, John, Olson, Randy (PHT), and Olson, Randy",
        "Description": "In 1811, Pittsfield, Massachusetts played host to the first Berkshire County Fair. It was a modest event, organized by a gentleman farmer concerned that our fledgling nation was falling behind Europe in farming and animal husbandry. He invited his neighbors to display their best livestock, with prizes worth $70 as the reward. A band of music played and floats carrying a loom and a spinning jenny paraded proudly. Simple as it was, the Berkshire County Fair marked the start of an enduring American institution.More than a century and a half later, the county fair thrives as a celebration of community and accomplishment. Although fewer than 3 percent of the population still work the land, these annual gatherings draw enthusiastic visitors wherever they are held, and this richly illustrated book evokes all the charm, excitement, and competitive spirit that animates every county fair, great or small. Author John McCarry and photographer Randy Olson crisscrossed America from the Deep South to the Pacific Northwest, from New England to Southern California, to create a fascinating portrait of an American phenomenon.Boasting a blue-ribbon collection of more than 80 full-color photographs, this wonderful book captures the quintessential spirit shared by all county fairs: a mix of wistful nostalgia for our agrarian past and an unabashedly commercial thrust toward the future. It's a world where a child's button collection can stand proudly beside a $250,000 John Deere harvester, where youngsters groom their lambs while their elders assess the future of farming in America, and where millions of visitors enjoy themselves year after year. Here's a chance to join the throng - in National Geographic's County Fairs.",

        "Authors": "By Winterrowd, Wayne",
        "Description": "Annuals for Connoisseurs is an inspiring and practical introduction to the overlooked world of annuals. This vast group of plants has something to offer to gardeners of any level of skill: colors ranging from the palest shades of sky blue to startling magenta, foliage both delicate and bold, a season of bloom longer than that of most perennials and plants that cushion the ground or soar to ten feet and more.Wayne Winterrowd introduces us to a collection of his favorite annuals - a mixture of classics seen in a new light, as well as new gems revealed. He discusses how to use them creatively in and around your garden, whether planted in a border, as a container plant or cut for an indoor arrangement.With an appreciation and an authority gained of long experience, Winterrowd proves that annuals \"of all the major groups of plants have as much to offer as any and it could be argued, more.\" When it comes to annuals, he revels in the peculiarly attractive characteristics and homey qualities that have made them so loved for so long - and with good reason.From the exceptional to the winningly sweet, the plants presented in Annuals for Connoisseurs are choice additions to any garden. Victorian amaranthus, graceful briza, romantic nigella, stately cannas, these annuals are equally at home alone in a terra-cotta container or among the shrubs and perennials of a mixed border. The author has himself explored, tested and coaxed the loveliest of displays from plants virtually without number.In a chapter devoted to gardening techniques he shares a lifetime of experience, from starting plants from seed, to staking, to seed saving for the next generation. No detail of propagation or maintenance escapes Winterrowd's attention, and he reveals the attractions of each featured annual with the quiet pride of an admirer and the passion of an expert.",
