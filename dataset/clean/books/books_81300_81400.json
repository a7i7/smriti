Although she meets with beloved cousins and other relatives, she agonizes over the frustrating relationship she barely maintains with her fierce father and selfish stepmother. Searching for answers, Kyoko attempts to find a new understanding of what her father is really like, and how it has affected her own place in two distinct worlds. As her time to leave draws near, Kyoko begins to understand that her family connections may be a powerful cry of the heart, but it is the new world that has given her escape from a lonely past and the power to believe in herself.\"[A] COMPELLING MEMOIR . . .

We are on the cusp of a new era of progress, but we can't sit back and hope our elected officials will carry us there. We can join the people taking action at the local level, like the residents of a town in Oregon who protested unfair bills by paying in pennies, chickens and the shirts off their back. And we can follow the examples of the national heroes who are fighting for change and demanding accountability from our elected officials at the highest levels. If we refuse to listen to the cynics, we can join these everyday Americans, young and old, and harness our greatest resource: ourselves.\"",

        "Description": "A piping plover feigns a broken wing to lure a predator away from her nest. A vervet monkey \"cries wolf\" and misleads his neighbors. A sea otter uses a stone to break open abalone shells. Communicating, using tools, making tactical gestures and strategic moves, animals often display what looks to us like conscious, even calculated behavior. In this riveting book, Donald Griffin, a pioneer in the study of animal behavior, investigates the mystery of the animal mind. He makes a persuasive argument (highly controversial in some scientific circles) that animals do think.Building on his groundbreaking work in The Question of Animal Awareness and Animal Thinking, Griffin brings together what we now know about animal cognition. He draws on the last decade's research in animal behavior, the philosophy of mind, and cognitive science to broaden our understanding of the nature and potential of animal minds. In species ranging from bees to dolphins to chimpanzees, Griffin shows us examples of foraging behavior, predatory tactics, artifact construction, tool use, and the experimental psychology of animal cognition. He gives us instances of animals communicating vocally and symbolically and reveals some of the surprising intricacies of their social arrangements.As in earlier works, Griffin explores the curious taboo among ethologists that has caused scientists for half a century to ignore the possibility that animals have conscious experience. The communicative signals of animals provide a revealing \"window\" on their thoughts and feelings, and scientific investigation may soon tell us what it is like, subjectively, to be an animal. Indeed, Griffin argues, animals may one day be able to communicate their thoughts directly and explicitly, once we are prepared to listen.",

Here, acclaimed naturalist George Schaller uses his great evocative powers, and the insight gained by four and a half years in the forests of the Wolong and Tangjiahe panda reserves, to document the plight of these mysterious creatures and to awaken the human compassion urgently needed to save them.\"No scientist is better at letting the rest of us in on just how the natural world works; no poet sees the world with greater clarity or writes about it with more grace. . . . Anyone who genuinely cares for wildlife cannot help being grateful to Schaller\u2014both for his efforts to understand the panda and for the candor with which he reports what has gone so badly wrong in the struggle to save it from extinction.\"\u2014Geoffrey C. Ward, New York Times Book Review\"Schaller's book is a unique mix of natural history and the politics of conservation, and it makes for compelling reading. . . . Having been in giant panda country myself, I found some of the descriptions of the animals and habitats breathtaking. Schaller describes the daily routines and personalities of the giant pandas he studied (as well as their fates thereafter) as though they were his blood relatives. . . . Schaller's brilliant presentation of the complexities of conservation makes his book a milestone for the conservation movement.\"\u2014Devra G. Kleiman, Washington Post Book World\"George Schaller's most soulful work, written in journal style with many asides about a creature who evolved only two to three million years ago (about the same time as humans). . . . Here, conservation biology confronts an evil that grinds against hope and shatters the planet's diversity. Written with hope.\"\u2014Whole Earth Catalog\"A nicely crafted blend of wildlife observation and political-cultural analysis. . . . The Last Panda is a sad chronicle of our failure, so far, to stem the decline of the animal that may be the most beloved on the planet.\"\u2014Donald Dale Jackson, Smithsonian",

        "Title": "Standing Up to the Madness: Ordinary Heroes in Extraordinary Times",
        "Authors": "By Goodman, Amy and Goodman, David",
        "Description": "Standing Up to the Madness not only is a timely, inspiring, and even revolutionary look at who wields the greatest power in America--everyday people who take a chance and stand up for what they believe in--but also offers advice on what you can do to help.Where are the millions marching in the streets to defend human rights, civil liberties, and racial justice? Where is the mass revulsion against the killing and torture being carried out in our name? Where are the environmentalists? Where is the peace movement?The answer: They are everywhere.The award-winning sister-brother team of Amy Goodman, host of Democracy Now!, and investigative journalist David Goodman traveled the country to detail the ways in which grassroots activists have taken politics out of the hands of politicians. Standing Up to the Madness tells the stories of everyday citizens who have challenged the government and prevailed.As the Bush administration has waged war abroad and at home, it has catalyzed a vast groundswell of political action. From African-American residents of deluged New Orleans who are fighting racism and City Hall to regain their homes; to four Connecticut librarians who refused to spy on their patrons, challenged the USA PATRIOT Act, and won; to a group of high school students who were barred from performing a play they wrote on the Iraq War based on letters from soldiers; to the first U.S. Army officer to publicly refuse orders to deploy to Iraq, charging that his duty as an officer is to refuse to fight in an illegal and immoral war, Standing Up to the Madness profiles citizens rising to extraordinary challenges. And, in the process, they are changing the way that politics is done, both now and in the future.In communities around the United States, courageous individuals have taken leaps of faith to stop the madness. They could only hope that if they led, others would follow. That is how movements are born. What begins as one, eventually becomes many. In that tradition, the authors have included the ways in which any individual can take action and effect change.",
