High-Tech Worship? takes a careful look at these issues, giving readers practical guidance on how they can best use the gift of technology in their churches. Both clergy and lay leaders will benefit from its creative suggestions as they seek to integrate technology wisely into their worship services.

Like Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, Mapping Human History is a groundbreaking synthesis of science and history. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including the latest genetic research, linguistic evidence, and archaeological findings, Olson reveals the surprising unity among modern humans and \"demonstrates just how naive some of our ideas about our human ancestry have been\" (Discover).Olson offers a genealogy of all humanity, explaining, for instance, why everyone can claim Julius Caesar and Confucius as forebears. Olson also provides startling new perspectives on the invention of agriculture, the peopling of the Americas, the origins of language, the history of the Jews, and more. An engaging and lucid account, Mapping Human History will forever change how we think about ourselves and our relations with others.",

        "Title": "Fire in the Blood",
        "Authors": "By Nemirovsky, Irene and Smith, Sandra (TRN)",
        "Description": "Here is a missing piece of the remarkable posthumous legacy of Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky, author of the internationally acclaimed Suite Fran\u00e7aise.Written in 1941, the manuscript of Fire in the Blood was entrusted in pieces to family and a friend when the author was sent to her death at Auschwitz. The novel\u2014only now assembled in its entirety\u2014teems with the intertwined lives of an insular French village in the years before the war, when \u201cpeace\u201d was less important as a political state than as a coveted personal condition: the untroubled pinnacle of happiness.At the center of the tale is Silvio: in his younger years he fled the boredom of the village and made a life of travel and adventure. Now he\u2019s returned, living in a farmer\u2019s hovel in the middle of the woods, and, much to his family\u2019s chagrin, perfectly content with his solitude.But when he attends the wedding of his favorite young cousin\u2014\"she has the thing that, when I was young, I used to value most in women: she has fire\"\u2014Silvio begins to be drawn back into the complicated life of this small town. As his narration unfolds, we are given an intimate picture of the loves and infidelities, the scandals, the youthful ardor and regrets of age that tie Silvio to the long-guarded secrets of the past.N\u00e9mirovsky wrote with a crystalline understanding of the pretensions and protections of society, and of the varied workings of the human heart, in language as evocative of a vanished era as of the emotional and moral ambiguities in her characters\u2019 lives. All of which was evident in Suite Fran\u00e7aise\u2014and abundantly evident again in this powerful, passionate novel.A Note on the TextUntil recently, only a partial text of Fire in the Blood was thought to exist, typed up by Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky\u2019s husband, Michel Epstein, to whom she often passed her manuscripts for this purpose. However, Michel's typing breaks off at the words 'I felt so old' (see p. 37), leaving the novel unfinished.Did Michel stop typing when Ir\u00e8ne was arrested and deported to Auschwitz on 13 July 1942? Or perhaps even earlier in 1942, when she could no longer find a way to get her novels and short stories published? As readers will learn from the Preface to the French edition of this novel found at the back of the book, it is likely that N\u00e9mirovsky was still working on Fire in the Blood in 1942. We know this thanks to the work of Olivier Philipponnat and Patrick Lienhardt, who were commissioned to write a biography of N\u00e9mirovsky, and who began extensive research into her archive. Two pages of the original manuscript were found to have been in the suitcase that N\u00e9mirovsky's daughter, Denise Epstein, carried with her from Issy-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque when she and her sister, Elisabeth, fled after their mother's arrest, and which contained N\u00e9mirovsky\u2019s great lost novel Suite Fran\u00e7aise. And as Philipponnat and Lienhardt trawled the N\u00e9mirovsky archive at the Institut M\u00e9moires de l'\u00e9dition contemporaine (IMEC), they discovered, amidst papers given by N\u00e9mirovsky for safe-keeping to her editor and family friend in the spring of 1942, the rest of the missing manuscript: thirty tightly packed pages of handwriting, with very few crossings out, the beginning of which corresponded to Michel\u2019s typed version.It is an extraordinary collection of papers, which adds to our understanding of N\u00e9mirovsky\u2019s oeuvre. As well as the manuscript of Fire in the Blood, it contains N\u00e9mirovsky\u2019s working notebooks dating back to 1933, successive versions of several of her novels including David Golder as well as outlines for Captivit\u00e9, the projected third part of Suite Fran\u00e7aise.",

        "Description": "Ever since Einstein's study of Brownian Motion, scientists have understood that a little disorder can actually make systems more effective. But most people still shun disorder-or suffer guilt over the mess they can't avoid. No longer!With a spectacular array of true stories and case studies of the hidden benefits of mess,A Perfect Mess overturns the accepted wisdom that tight schedules, organization, neatness, and consistency are the keys to success. Drawing on examples from business, parenting, cooking, the war on terrorism, retail, and even the meteoric career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, coauthors Abrahmson and Freedman demonstrate that moderately messy systems use resources more efficiently, yield better solutions, and are harder to break than neat ones.Applying this idea on scales both large (government, society) and small (desktops, garages), A Perfect Mess uncovers all the ways messiness can trump neatness, and will help you assess the right amount of disorder for any system. Whether it's your company's management plan or your hallway closet that bedevils you, this book will show you why to say yes to mess.",

People don't make ships and swords unless they intend to use them.\"  The year is A.D. 793. In the next months, Jack and his little sister, Lucy, are enslaved by Olaf One-Brow and his fierce young shipmate, Thorgil. With a crow named Bold Heart for mysterious company, they are swept up into an adventure-quest that follows in the spirit of The Lord of the Rings.  Other threats include a willful mother Dragon, a giant spider, and a troll-boar with a surprising personality -- to say nothing of Ivar the Boneless and his wife, Queen Frith, a shape-shifting half-troll, and several eight foot tall, orange-haired, full-time trolls. But in stories by award-winner Nancy Farmer, appearances do deceive. She has never told a richer, funnier tale, nor offered more timeless encouragement to young seekers than \"Just say no to pillaging.\"",

In the groundbreaking Think Thin, Be Thin, nationally prominent psychotherapist Doris Wild Helmering and award-winning health writer Dianne Hales assert that the true key to a healthy body weight is a healthy attitude toward food and exercise.

He explains what is wrong with our country and how to solve our problems in his blockbuster new book, Real Change: From the World That Fails to the World That Works.In this no-holds-barred assessment of American politics, Gingrich approaches our nation\u2019s problems with a private-sector mentality and an entrepreneurial spirit, offering commonsense solutions for the issues of today and the challenges of tomorrow.He lambasts both parties for creating a &#147;government of the bureaucrats, by the consultants, and for the special interests\u201d and busts the myth that voters are entrenched in a &#147;red state\u201d vs. &#147;blue state\u201d mentality. Gingrich exposes the truth: Americans are united on almost every important issue. It\u2019s the politicians who drag us into partisan bickering and away from real change.",
