Rendezvous magazine has praised her as a novelist whose \u201clarger than life heroes and heroines make you believe all the warm, wonderful, wild things in life.\u201d Now, in the classic romantic tradition her fans have come to love, here is another sexy and extraordinary tale of passion--the story of a woman who gives up fame and fortune...and discovers true love in the last place she expected to find it.The Rana LookThe modeling world called it the Rana Look...the exotic, one-of-a-kind allure that only supermodel Rana Ramsey could deliver. With her green eyes, olive skin, and wildly lustrous auburn hair, Rana posed for ad campaigns and strutted down runways all over the world, naming her own price to sell everything from cosmetics to women\u2019s lingerie. But all of that suddenly ended one day when she looked her demanding mother-manager in the eye and said, \u201cEnough.\u201d That was the day Rana packed her things and left New York--and modeling--forever. Settling in Miss Ruby\u2019s boardinghouse in Galveston, Texas, Rana finds success with her own business--and cultivates a new look to go with her new life. Now her beautiful eyes are shielded behind tinted glasses, her famous figure hidden under shapeless dresses, her trademark wild hair falling straight down her back. Rana knows she\u2019ll never attract a man this way, and that\u2019s just fine with her--that is, until Ruby\u2019s nephew, football star Trent Gamblin, moves in to nurse his injured shoulder. Ruggedly handsome, charming, and undeniably charismatic, Trent is the kind of man that Rana finds irresistible...the kind of man she is certain would never look twice at a woman as ordinary as the new Rana.But to her surprise, Trent seems unfazed by her Plain Jane look. For he is drawn to a beauty that Rana can\u2019t hide. He is determined to learn the mystery behind the elusive, reclusive boarder with the secret past. To do so, he proposes an unusual pact: they will only be friends, nothing more.As the days pass, Rana and Trent are drawn together in a sensual idyll unlike anything either of them has ever known. But the outside world cannot be kept at bay forever.  And Rana fears that when Trent learns the truth about her past, he\u2019ll feel betrayed and deceived. Even worse, he\u2019ll never be able to see her as she truly is. Then an unexpected tragedy strikes, and the stakes seem higher than ever. Now they must look deep into each other\u2019s heart to determine if their relationship is just an impossibly erotic dream--or a dream of love come true.",

He's also determined to do something about the long \"tradition\" of permanent loans to faculty of shovels, saws, even cars, from the school's supplies. Eloquent as he is on the subject of honor, rumor has it he's only taken this job to escape his past. And Hawthorne isn't the only uneasy newcomer. There's Jessica, a former stripper at fifteen, and Frank LeBrun, a replacement cook who's a bit too quick with a dirty joke. All three have secrets to conceal, memories to suppress.Serene on the surface, the ivy-clad, tree-lined campus gives few clues to the school's history of special privileges, petty corruptions, and hidden allegiances. But as autumn advances, the affable smiles and pretenses of virtue wear thin. And as winter closes in, students, teachers, and staff get an education in savagery and murder. With his  customary uncanny awareness of the intricacies of human nature, the acclaimed author of The Church of Dead Girls once again probes the daily life of an ordinary community to reveal the depths of good and evil.",

Her husband, Richard, works for a humanitarian organization dedicated to the health and prosperity of developing countries and wants her help on an extended AIDS assignment in the Dominican Republic. But Alma begs off joining him: the publisher is breathing down her neck. She promises to work hard and follow him a bit later.  The truth is that Alma is seriously sidetracked by a story she has stumbled across. It's the story of a much earlier medical do-gooder, Spaniard Francisco Xavier Balmis, who in 1803 undertook to vaccinate the populations of Spain's American colonies against smallpox. To do this, he required live \"carriers\" of the vaccine.  Of greater interest to Alma is Isabel Sendales y G\u00f3mez, director of La Casa de Exp\u00f3sitos, who was asked to select twenty-two orphan boys to be the vaccine carriers. She agreed\u2014 with the stipulation that she would accompany the boys on the proposed two-year voyage. Her strength and courage inspire Alma, who finds herself becoming obsessed with the details of Isabel's adventures. This resplendent novel-within-a-novel spins the disparate tales of two remarkable women, both of whom are swept along by machismo. In depicting their confrontation of the great scourges of their respective eras, Alvarez exposes the conflict between altruism and ambition.",

Over the last year, few people have witnessed more scenes of chaos and conflict than Anderson Cooper, whose groundbreaking coverage on CNN has become the touchstone of twenty-first century journalism. This book explores in a very personal way the most important - and most dangerous - crises of our time, and the surprising impact they have had on his life.From the devastating tsunami in South Asia to the suffering Niger, and ultimately Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Cooper shares his own experiences of traversing the globe, covering the world\u2019s most astonishing stories. As a television journalist, he has the gift of speaking with an emotional directness that cuts through the barriers of the medium. In his first book, that passion communicates itself through a rich fabric of memoir and reportage, reflection and first-person narrative. Unflinching and utterly engrossing, this is the story of an extraordinary year in a reporter\u2019s life.",

But Jesus is also an incredible example of how to lead a faithful life. Jesus, as a human, walked on earth and confronted the same struggles that we face. Our primary mission as his followers is to learn from him -- to become his apprentices. In this book we seek to further our apprenticeship by studying everything from Jesus's interactions with those around him to the revolutionary wisdom recorded in the Gospels.

Adam and Eve encountered him directly in the Garden of Eden, Teresa of Avila experienced him through visions, and Francis of Assisi heard his voice in nature. This book gives practical advice for connecting on a deeply personal level with God. It uncovers new places to look for God, while providing reflection questions and activities to reinvigorate communication with God in such traditional areas as prayer and Bible study. Divided into twelve chapters conveniently organized for individual or group study, each section explores a different area in which we can deepen our individual communion with God. The Renovar\u00e9 Spiritual Formation Guides, created by Richard J. Foster and the team that developed The Renovar\u00e9 Spiritual Formation Bible and the longstanding A Spiritual Formation Workbook, provide tangible lessons that help us become spiritually formed, conformed, and transformed into the image of Jesus Christ. Geared for either individual study or use in small groups, each Renovar\u00e9 Spiritual Formation Guide explores one facet of our life with God, providing readings from Scripture as well as classic and contemporary works of spirituality. The combination of readings, reflection questions, exercises, and activities makes these books invaluable interactive guides that prompt true spiritual growth.",

Compassionate and experienced counselors Dr. Steve Stephens and Pam Vredevelt, LPC, have walked alongside women in pain for years\u2014they\u2019ve heard the stories, seen the tears, felt the pain, and entered into the devastation.

When Beth Nonte Russell travels to China to help her friend Alex adopt a baby girl from an orphanage there, she thinks it will be an adventure, a chance to see the world. But her friend, who had prepared for the adoption for many months, panics soon after being presented with the frail baby, and the situation develops into one of the greatest challenges of Russell's life.   Russell, watching in disbelief as Alex distances herself from the child, cares for the baby -- clothing, bathing, and feeding her -- and makes her feel secure in the unfamiliar surroundings. Russell is overwhelmed and disoriented by the unfolding drama and all that she sees in China, and yet amid the emotional turmoil finds herself deeply bonding with the child. She begins to have dreams of an ancient past -- dreams of a young woman who is plucked from the countryside and chosen to be empress, and of the child who is ultimately taken from her. As it becomes clear that her friend -- whose indecisiveness about the adoption has become a torment -- won't be bringing the baby home, Russell is amazed to realize that she cannot leave the baby behind and that her dreams have been telling her something significant, giving her the courage to open her heart and bring the child home against all odds.   Steeped in Chinese culture, Forever Lily is an extraordinary account of a life-changing, wholly unexpected love.",

There's no traffic light and no mail delivery; people can vanish without a trace and funerals are a community affair. Heather Lende posts both the obituaries and the social column for her local newspaper. If anyone knows the going-on in this close-knit town\u2014from births to weddings to funerals\u2014she does. Whether contemplating the mysterious death of eccentric Speedy Joe, who wore nothing but a red union suit and a hat he never took off, not even for a haircut; researching the details of a one-legged lady gold miner's adventurous life; worrying about her son's first goat-hunting expedition; observing the awe-inspiring Chilkat Bald Eagle Festival; or ice skating in the shadow of glacier-studded mountains, Lende's warmhearted style brings us inside her small-town life. We meet her husband, Chip, who owns the local lumber yard; their five children; and a colorful assortment of quirky friends and neighbors, including aging hippies, salty fishermen, native Tlingit Indians, and volunteer undertakers\u2014as well as the moose, eagles, sea lions, and bears with whom they share this wild and perilous land.  Like Bailey White's tales of Southern life or Garrison Keillor's reports from the Midwest, NPR commentator Heather Lende's take on her offbeat Alaskan hometown celebrates life in a dangerous and breathtakingly beautiful place.",

Thousands of volumes have been written on the subject of a god, and the vast majority have answered the questions with a resounding 'Yes!' \"\"You are about to read a minority viewpoint.\"With this intriguing introduction, George H. Smith sets out to demolish what he considers the most widespread and destructive of all the myths devised by man - the concept of a supreme being. With painstaking scholarship and rigorous arguments, Mr. Smith examines, dissects, and refutes the myriad \"proofs\" offered by theists - the defenses of sophisticated, professional theologians, as well as the average religious layman. He explores the historical and psychological havoc wrought by religion in general - and concludes that religious belief cannot have any place in the life of modern, rational man.\"It is not my purpose to convert people to atheism . . . (but to) demonstrate that the belief in God is irrational to the point of absurdity. If a person wishes to continue believing in a god, that is his prerogative, but he can no longer excuse his belief in the name of reason and moral necessity.\"",

By margins of at least two to one, they we favor affordable healthcare for all, even if it means raising taxes; want federal action to combat global warming; support stricter gun control; don\u2019t want Roe vs. Wade overturned; and the list goes on. So why is it so hard for progressive candidates to win elections? Because, says Bernie Horn, most progressives don\u2019t know how to explain their ideas in ways that resonate with \u201cpersuadables\u201d\u2014the significant slice of the electorate who don\u2019t instantly identify as Democrats or Republicans. These are the voters who swing elections. There\u2019s been a lot of theoretical discussion about framing lately, but Framing the Future isn\u2019t theory\u2014the concepts outlined have been used successfully by progressive candidates across the nation, even in such conservative bastions as Montana, Arizona, and Florida.  Drawing on rigorous polling data and his own experience as a veteran political consultant, Horn explains how persuadable voters think about issues and make political decisions and why, as a result, the usual progressive approaches are practically designed to fail with them.  He offers a crash course in the nuts and bolts of framing and shows how to use three bedrock American values\u2014freedom, opportunity, and security\u2014to frame progressive positions in a way that creates a consistent, unified political vision that will appeal to persuadable voters. He even offers advice on specific words and phrases to use when talking about a variety of issues and ideas.",

In this swift-moving and colorful chronicle, written by St. John as though he were an on-the-scene reporter, you will discover how Congressman James Madison became in the formative months of the new Republic the power behind Washington in the executive branch--while wheeling and dealing in Congress, and still championing a separation of powers; how Madison had to fight both friend and foe of the Constitution to pass a Federal Bill of Rights in the First Congress; why Washington and Madison saw the future of America in the frontier West and not in Europe; and how Spanish and British intrigues, with the aid of hostile Indian tribes on the American frontier, posed a threat to the survival of the new national government.Retired Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Warren E. Burger said, \"this book, like the first two of St. John's trilogy, tells an exciting story of our nation's founding, which should engage readers of all ages and backgrounds.\"This book and its predecessors are a captivating history lesson--told like a banner headline news story--for Americans wanting to know the roots of the political freedoms they enjoy today.",

        "Authors": "By Mackey, Sandra",
        "Description": "Despite all of the expert commentary that the Gulf War produced, the Arab world remains an enigma for most of us. But now, in this knowledgeable, fascinating portrait, a highly regarded authority explores the history and culture, the issues and personalities, behind one of the world's most misunderstood regions. Sandra Mackey draws on her own years of living and traveling in the Middle East to create a vivid account of this troubled area and the conflicting influences that shape it.This many-faceted and enlightening exploration moves from country to country - Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and the land that the Palestinians call theirs - and profiles the leaders - Nasser and Sadat, King Hussein, Hafiz Assad, Saddam Hussein, and Yassir Arafat. Mackey examines and explains Arab history from its Bedouin beginnings through the rise of Islam and the great age of expansion...then through the centuries of decline and subjugation, first to Turkey and then to the West. The rise of Arab nationalism is dramatically chronicled against the background of such landmark events as the war for Palestine, the three major armed conflicts with Israel, the oil embargo, the spread of terrorism, the Iraq-Iran war, the Intifadah, and the Gulf War. All this is set within a brilliantly explicated context of Arab culture, psychology, and religion that goes far to illumine the bonds that hold the Arab world together and the rivalries that split it apart.Whether dealing with the course of the struggle for Palestine, the complex chain of events leading up to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the twists and turns of U.S. relations with the Arab nations, or any of the other thorny issues that come with the territory, Passion and Politics is remarkable for its evenhanded objectivity. It combines the immediacy of a travelogue, the information of impeccable scholarship, and the human insight of Sandra Mackey's first-hand experience to provide vital understanding of an area that plays an increasingly key role in global affairs. For anyone seeking to make coherent sense of the often chaotic turbulence of Arab affairs and actions, this extraordinary book achieves that daunting purpose with rare style and clarity.",
