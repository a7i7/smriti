        "Authors": "By O'Shaughnessy, James P.",
        "Description": "In this seminal work that has shaken up Wall Street, quantitative pioneer James P. O'Shaughnessy presents factual, unbiased, and unexpected findings on what investing strategies actually work in the stock market. His analysis makes clear that you can do vastly better than the market by consistently using stock selection strategies that have withstood the test of time. Moreover, four decades of results warn investors to steer clear of some popular investment methods that can be toxic to their wealth.Which investment strategies are winners - and which are losers? What factors most reliably indicate that a stock will rise? Are value strategies better than growth approaches? Is the P/E ratio important? What about the price-to-sales ratio? In this book, O'Shaughnessy reveals his often surprising findings - including little-used strategies that have regularly earned more than 18% per year.It doesn't matter if you are an aggressive investor seeking fast growth, or a conservative investor seeking low risk, high-yielding stocks for your retirement account - no matter what your style of investing is, O'Shaughnessy's landmark study shows you beyond a shadow of doubt what strategies work on Wall Street.",

        "Description": "What happens if, after being given up for adoption in childhood, you reestablish contact with your biological family - only to discover that your newfound brother is a killer? Anne Bird, the sister of Scott Peterson, knows firsthand.Soon after her birth in 1965, Anne was given up for adoption by her mother, Jackie Latham. Welcomed into the well-adjusted Grady family, she lived a happy life. Then, in the late 1990s, she came back into contact with her mother, now Jackie Peterson, and her family - including Jackie's son Scott Peterson and his wife, Laci. Anne was welcomed into the family, and over the next several years she grew close to Scott and especially Laci. Together they shared holidays, family reunions, and even a trip to Disneyland. Anne and Laci became pregnant at roughly the same time, and the two became confidantes.Then, on Christmas Eve 2002, Laci Peterson went missing - and the happy facade of the Peterson family slowly began to crumble. Anne rushed to the family's aid, helping in the search for Laci, even allowing Scott to stay in her home while police tried to find his wife. Yet Scott's behavior grew increasingly bizarre during the search, and Anne grew suspicious that her brother knew more than he was telling. Finally she began keeping a list of his disturbing behavior. And by the time Laci's body - and that of her unborn son, Conner - were found, Anne was becoming convinced: Her brother Scott Peterson had murdered his wife and unborn child in cold blood.Filled with news-making revelations and intimate glimpses of Scott and Laci, the Peterson family, and the investigation that followed the murder, Blood Brother is an account of how long-dormant family ties dragged one woman into one of the most notorious crimes of our time.",

        "Description": "The dramatic story of the first daredevil pilots of the U.S. Air Mail Service who risked their lives daily to map new aviation routes, which are still in use today, and deliver mail throughout the U.S.  It was the pilots of the U.S. Air Mail service who made it possible for flight to evolve from an impractical and deadly fad to today's worldwide network of airlines. Nicknamed \"The Suicide Club,\" this small but daring cadre of pilots took a fleet of flimsy World War I \"Jenny\" Biplanes and blazed a trail of sky routes across the country. In the midst of the Jazz Age, they were dashing, group\u2013proud, brazen, and resentful of authority. They were also loyal, determined to prove the skeptics wrong. Mavericks Of The Sky, by Barry Rosenberg and Catherine Macaulay, is a narrative non\u2013fiction account of the crucial, first three years of the air mail service \u2013 beginning with the inaugural New York\u2013to\u2013Washington D.C. flight in 1918, through 1921 when aviator Jack Knight was the first to fly across the country at night and furthermore, through a blizzard. In those early years, one out of every four men lost their lives. With the constant threat of weather and mechanical failure and with little instrumentation available, aviators relied on their wits and instincts to keep them out of trouble. Mavericks Of The Sky brings these sagas to life, and tells the story of the extraordinary lives and rivalries of those who single\u2013handedly pulled off the great experiment. Drawing on numerous first\u2013hand accounts, Mavericks Of The Sky brings to life the nationwide effort to establish air mail service, focusing on the exploits of the most daring and colorful pilots \u2013 pioneers who proved the great American belief that anything is possible with conviction, diligence, and perseverance.",

        "Description": "You get sick; you go to your doctor. Too bad. Because medicine isn't an industry, it's practically witchcraft. Despite the growth of big pharma, HMOs, and hospital chains, medicine remains the isolated work of individual doctors\u2014and the system is going broke fast. So why is Andy Kessler\u2014the man who told you outrageous stories of Wall Street analysts gone bad in Wall Street Meat and tales from inside a hedge fund in Running Money\u2014poking around medicine for the next big wave of technology? It's because he smells change coming. Heart attacks, strokes, and cancer are a huge chunk of medical spending, yet there's surprisingly little effort to detect disease before it's life threatening. How lame is that\u2014especially since the technology exists today to create computer-generated maps of your heart and colon? Because it's too expensive\u2014for now. But Silicon Valley has turned computing, telecom, finance, music, and media upside down by taking expensive new technologies and making them ridiculously cheap. So why not the $1.8 trillion health care business, where the easiest way to save money is to stop folks from getting sick in the first place? Join Kessler's bizarre search for the next big breakthrough as he tries to keep from passing out while following cardiologists around, cracks jokes while reading mammograms, and watches twitching mice get injected with radioactive probes. Looking for a breakthrough, Kessler even selflessly pokes, scans, and prods himself.CT scans of your heart will identify problems before you have a heart attack or stroke; a nanochip will search your blood for cancer cells--five years before they grow uncontrollably and kill you; and baby boomers can breathe a little easier because it's all starting to happen now. Your doctor can't be certain what's going on inside your body, but technology will.  Embedding the knowledge of doctors in silicon will bring a breakout technology to health care, and we will soon see an end of medicine as we know it.",

From his boyhood days traveling around the world with his father (professional wrestler Rocky Johnson) to his years as a football player at the University of Miami to his meteoric rise through the ranks of the Federation, The Rock Says. . .chronicles in vivid detail the life story of one of sports-entertainment's most innovative and best-loved personalities.The Rock recalls his injury-plagued career at Miami and a subsequent foray to the Great White North, where he discovered that in Canada being a professional football player is not exactly a glamorous life. After a few months of sleeping on putrid, stained mattresses that he dug out of the garbage and subsisting on nothing but plain spaghetti, \"D.J.\" ditched his cleats forever and set his sights on the path of his father and grandfather--wrestling.Performing first in the minors as plain old Dwayne Johnson, then as \"Flex Kavana\" and later as \"Rocky Maivia,\" he quickly became one of the World Wrestling Federation's hopefuls. But no matter how he tried to get over with the fans, the stadiums greeted him with chants of \"Rocky sucks! Rocky sucks!\" He then adopted the brash persona of The Rock--a snorting, spitting, snotting, swearing son-of-a-bitch with the soul of a smart-ass comic and the body of an Adonis--and he found his true calling as the \"People's Champion.\"The Rock will take fans on a guided tour of big-time professional wrestling, a highly competitive business in which a handful of gifted and lucky performers dominate, and all others dream of a moment in the spotlight. He provides a breathtaking, minute-by-minute account of Wrestle Mania, the Super Bowl of pro wrestling, including an intimate backstage look at rehearsals with his opponent, Stone Cold Steve Austin. And he discusses in heartfelt detail the loss of his friend and co-worker, Owen Hart.Filled with genuinely touching stories of love and strife, hilarious anecdotes, inside accounts of an industry whose machinations have long been shrouded in secrecy and dozens of previously unpublished photographs from The Rock's personal collection, The Rock Says. . .is--as The Rock himself might put it--\"the coolest thing since the other side of the pillow if you smell what The Rock is cookin'.\"",

        "Title": "Good Catholic Girls: How Women Are Leading the Fight to Change the Church",
        "Authors": "By Bonavoglia, Angela",
        "Description": "The inspiring true story of the women who are fighting for the soul of the Catholic ChurchAngela Bonavoglia is a self-described \"itinerant Catholic.\" Born a Catholic, she knew she would die a Catholic. She was resigned to living with the knowledge that the Church had failed to live up to its own ideals, but then she heard the story of one woman who had the courage to say no to the pope. That launched Bonavoglia on a journey of discovery, through which she found many contemporary women, all over the world, stepping forward to challenge one of the last bastions of male authority -- the Roman Catholic Church. She began to believe that change just might be possible.The recently exposed transgressions of priests within the Church stunned the faithful and sent a new surge of energy through the progressive Church reform movement in the United States. Despite the movement's growing profile, the world has only recently learned that Catholic women are the driving force behind reform. Good Catholic Girls is a lively account of these courageous women, as seen through Bonavoglia's eyes. They include Joan Chittister, the Benedictine nun who refused to obey a Vatican order not to speak at the first international conference for women's ordination groups worldwide; Mary Ramerman, ordained a Catholic priest before 3,000 jubilant supporters in a packed theater in Rochester, New York; Frances Kissling, whose fight for women's reproductive rights has shaken the Church at its highest levels; priest abuse survivor Barbara Blaine, who created the most powerful voice for victims, the Survivors' Network of those Abused by Priests; and Sister Jeannine Gramick, who built a pioneering ministry to gays and lesbians, despite Vatican orders to silence her and ban her work.Backed by supporters worldwide, these and other women are rethinking Catholic theology, changing the face of ministry, and resurrecting the lost lives of female Church leaders. They are working to open ordination to all, challenging the Church's sexual repression, and calling the Church to openness and accountability. Their work is brave, provocative, and vital, for what becomes of women in the Catholic Church will determine what becomes of the Church itself. As Bonavoglia shows in this compelling book, the hierarchy ignores them at its peril.",

As a deeply felt tale of a man who risks and rediscovers his family and purpose, it also has all the hallmarks of a classic. Ashbrook undertakes his white-knuckle journey in pursuit of the dream of an Internet startup without business experience, a technical background, or money. \"I always knew you would do something crazy in the middle of your life,\" his wife, Danielle, tells him as their relationship careens through a dramatic rebirth of its own. \"I just never knew it would be this kind of crazy.\" Ashbrook's odyssey is also the great American joy ride -- the story of two guys in the laboratory, in the garage, on the frontier, betting the ranch and then racing, half scared out of their wits, half giddy with adrenaline, toward the finish line. Success, when it finally comes, is sweet, but it is Ashbrook's story of self-transformation along the way that wins our hearts with its candor, its unabashed zeal, and the self-deprecating humor the author shares as he throws himself and his family over the edge in the middle of life to reach out for a new beginning.",

        "Authors": "By Bloom, Allan David",
        "Description": "Written with the erudition and wit that made The Closing of the American Mind a #1 best-seller, Love and Friendship is a searching examination of the basic human connections at the center of the greatest works of literature and philosophy throughout the ages.In a spirited polemic directed at our contemporary culture, Allan Bloom argues that we live in a world where love and friendship are withering away. Science and moralism have reduced eros to sex. Individualism and egalitarianism have turned romantic relationships into contractual matters to be litigated. Survey research has made every variety of sexual behavior seem normal, and thus boring. In sex education classes, children learn how to use condoms, but not how to deal with the hopes and risks of intimacy. We no longer know how to talk and think about the peril and promise of attraction and fidelity.What has been lost is what separates human beings from beasts - the power of the imagination, which can transform sex into eros. Our impoverished feelings are rooted in our impoverished language of love. To recover the danger, the strength, and the beauty of eros, we must study the great literature of love, in the hope of rekindling the imagination of beauty and virtue that fuels eros. We must love to learn, in order to learn to love again.Like The Closing of the American Mind, this is an exhilarating journey of ideas in search of the truths that great writers and philosophers have offered about our most precious and perilous longings. Love and Friendship dissects Rousseau's invention of Romantic love, meant to provide a new basis for human connection, amid the atomism of bourgeois society, and exposes the reasons for its ultimate failure. Bloom tells of the Romantics' idea of the sublime and Freud's theory of sublimation. He takes us into the universe of Shakespeare's plays, where love is a natural phenomenon that gives rise to both the brightest hopes and the bitterest conflicts and disappointments. Finally, Bloom offers a fresh reading of the greatest work on eros, Plato's Symposium.A profound analysis of the literature of eros from the Bible to Freud, Love and Friendship is a powerful book that will inspire as well as outrage, amuse as well as illuminate. The culmination of a lifetime spent thinking and writing about the most fundamental questions facing human beings, it will change forever how we think about our most personal relationships and our most intimate dreams and desires.",

        "Title": "Milestones of Science: The History of Humankind's Greatest Ideas (reading line)",
        "Authors": "By Suplee, Curt",
        "Description": "WHY? It's the most basic question known to humankind, the query that has set us apart from all other species ever since our earliest ancestor stood erect and wondered what made the sun rise every morning or how fire could be tamed. We call ourselves Homo sapiens -- the wise men -- and our thirst for knowledge is science in its purest form. Each answer sparks new questions in an endless quest for knowledge. The rigorous methods and sophisticated tools modern scientists use to investigate everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the farthest reaches of our universe all trace to our intellectual curiosity, that uniquely human trait acquired in our prehistoric past.  Highlighted by more than 300 vivid photographs and illustrations, this fascinating history chronicles the important milestones of scientific thought, each a building block for new revelations. Award-winning science writer Curt Suplee identifies the key ideas and discoveries that shaped our understanding of our world and ourselves and introduces the men and women whose questing intellects illuminated the very nature of reality itself.  We hear Archimedes shout \"Eureka!\" and listen as Aristotle ponders nature's mysteries. We peer through Galileo's telescope as he revolutionizes astronomy, and through Leeuwenhoek's microscope as he finds life teeming in a single drop of water. We meet Marie Curie in a darkened lab lit by the ghostly glow of radium and stand beside the physicists of Los Alamos as the nuclear age is born in a flash of blinding light. And these are only a few of the scientific pioneers whose insights are explored and explained, a brilliant roll call that sweeps from Euclid to Edison to Einstein, from Pythagoras and Ptolemy to Descartes, Newton, Darwin, Marconi, and many, many others.  In this engrossing, enlightening volume, Suplee brings science vividly to life, revealing a vital, intense pursuit far different from the dry and intimidating discipline we imagine all too often. Instead, he presents a comprehensive, compelling drama of discovery and accomplishment that encompasses every aspect of human experience as we seek to answer the quintessential question: why?",

        "Description": "As the pharmaceutical industry invests more and more in the development of new drugs, true breakthroughs are few and far between. Into the breach comes a panoply of product-line extensions and me-too drugs aimed at grabbing market share. The industry plows its high profits back into research, but invests an equal or greater sum in flogging its products in every imaginable venue. Research studies are designed to support marketing claims. Many doctors all over the country get their first information about new drugs from a salesperson. And, increasingly, prescription drugs are pitched to consumers on TV and the internet with images of hope, terror, or chic. Evidence-based practice guidelines, which endeavor to get the right medicines to those who will benefit most, can't be heard over the din.  Having created an unprecedented number of \"megabrands\"\u2014blockbuster drugs with huge sales\u2014and undergone an extraordinary wave of consolidation, some drug companies now find themselves in a precarious position. Patents are expiring on flagship products. In order to sustain the growth Wall Street has come to expect, these companies must produce billions of dollars worth of new revenue\u2014fast. But can Americans continue to bankroll Operation Grow Big Pharma? Must we swallow the bad with the good?",

        "Description": "This discussion resulted from a dialogue which began some seven years ago between a physicist who specializes in astrophysics, general relativity, and the foundations of quantum theory, and a student of cultural history who had done post-doctoral work in the history and philosophy of science. Both of us at that time were awaiting the results of some experiments being conducted under the direction of the physicist Alain Aspect at the University of Paris-South. ! The experiments were the last in a series designed to test some predictions based on a mathematical 2 theorem published in 1964 by John Bell. There was no expectation that the results of these experiments would provide the basis for developing new technologies. The questions which the experiments were designed to answer concerned the relation\u00ad ship between physical reality and physical theory in the branch of physics known as quantum mechanics. Like most questions raised by physicists which lead to startling new insights, they were disarmingly simple and direct. Is quantum physics, asked Bell, a self-consistent theory whose predictions would hold in a new class of experiments, or would the results reveal that the apparent challenges of quantum physics to the understanding in classical physics of the relationship between physical theory and physical reality were merely illusory? Answering this question in actual experiments could also, suggested Bell, lead to another, quite dramatic, result.",

The difficulty of finding and entering many of these secluded hideaways discourages less adventuresome cruisers - or at least it used to.Cruising the Chesapeake offers accurate, up-to-date navigational information to pilot the reader into practically every point of interest on the Bay, from the secluded east fork of Langford Creek to the hearts of such major cities as Baltimore, Washington, or Norfolk. At each spot you are told how to approach, where to anchor, what sort of dockage facilities or provisions are available, what has happened here in the past, what there is to see now, and what there is to do.But this is much more than just a pilot guide. It is a loving portrait of the Bay, its history, its peoples, its wildlife, and its environment. It is also a plea for the Bay's preservation. This Guide distills one family's 20 years of experience cruising the paths less traveled into an easy-to-use guide that is written with appreciation and respect for the Bay's fragile ecosystem.",

Students learn German through communicative contexts with an emphasis on the four skills and cultural competence, with grammar functioning as an aid to language learning and not an end in itself.  In the Natural Approach, students develop language in stages, with the comprehension stage preceding the production stage. For that reason, Kontakte focuses first on the receptive skills (listening and reading) before asking students to produce the language (speaking and writing).",

They had a blond Clairol wave in their hair. They wore girdles and waist-pinchers. . . . In recent years good girls join the army. They climb the corporate ladder. They go to the gym. . . . They wear painful pointy shoes. They don\u2019t eat too much. They . . . don\u2019t eat at all. They stay perfect. They stay thin. I could never be good.\u201dThe Good Body starts with Eve\u2019s tortured relationship with her own \u201cpost-forties\u201d stomach and her skirmishes with everything from Ab Rollers to fad diets and fascistic trainers in an attempt get the \u201cflabby badness\u201d out. As Eve hungrily seeks self-acceptance, she is joined by the voices of women from L.A. to Kabul, whose obsessions are also laid bare: A young Latina candidly critiques her humiliating \u201cspread,\u201d a stubborn layer of fat that she calls \u201ca second pair of thighs.\u201d The wife of a plastic surgeon recounts being systematically reconstructed\u2013inch by inch\u2013by her \u201cperfectionist\u201d husband. An aging magazine executive, still haunted by her mother\u2019s long-ago criticism, describes her desperate pursuit of youth as she relentlessly does sit-ups.Along the way, Eve also introduces us to women who have found a hard-won peace with their bodies: an African mother who celebrates each individual body as signs of nature\u2019s diversity; an Indian woman who transcends \u201ctreadmill mania\u201d and delights in her plump cheeks and curves; and a veiled Afghani woman who is willing to risk imprisonment for a taste of ice cream. These are just a few of the inspiring stories woven through Eve\u2019s global journey from obsession to enlightenment. Ultimately, these monologues become a personal wake-up call from Eve to love the \u201cgood bodies\u201d we inhabit.",

Thoroughly encompassing the 'back-to-basics' movement and the trend toward literature-based instruction, it offers clearly developed methodologies and lessons, and makes extensive use of children's actual language samples to illustrate ways literature can enhance the development of language arts skills.  Written by an award-winning author, the book focuses on material that embraces the needs of all learners: linguistically-different children, multicultural children, and children with learning disabilities and handicaps. Emphasizing the importance of literature-based strategies and the identification of literature that can be applied to each of the language arts, it offers 'For Your Plan Book', a special section at the end of most chapters which provides concrete ideas, field-tested lessons and unit plans teachers can take right into their classroom. Literature chapters are now moved to the forefront of the book, enabling instructors to place a greater emphasis on literature-related language arts. Strong methodologies in the composition chapters now encompass the writing process, plus results of a five-year composition study of the relationships between writing and literature.

We all  want to be absolutely surrendered to God, and yet we hardly dare utter the words.  We don't exactly know how.\u00a0Andrew Murray clearly and simply explains full surrender  to God and shows the way to a victorious life in Him.",
