        "Description": "Published in 1975, The Surface of Earth is the monumental narrative that charts the slow, inextricable twining of the Mayfield and Kendal families. Set in the plain of North Carolina and the coast and hills of Virginia from 1903 to 1944, it chronicles the marriage of Forrest Mayfield and Eva Kendal, the hard birth of their son, Eva's return to her father after her mother's death, and the lives of two succeeding generations.  The Surface of Earth is the work of one of America's supreme masters of fiction, a journey across time and the poignantly evoked America of the first half of our century that explores the mysterious topography of the powers of love, home, and identity. In his evocation of the hungers, defeats, and rewards of individuals in moments of dark solitude and radiant union, Price has created an enduring literary testament to the range of human life.",

        "Description": "From the publication of his famous first novel, A Long and Happy Life, in 1962, Reynolds Price has been accorded the praise and admiration reserved for America's most distinguished writers. (On the publication of that much loved book, Eudora Welty wrote, \"Reynolds Price is the most impressive new writer I've come across in a long time. He is a first-rate talent and we are lucky that he has started so young to write so well.\") In the years since, he has published many other acclaimed novels (most notably the 1986 novel Kate Vaiden, which won the Book Critics Circle Award for fiction), collections of stories, poems, plays, criticism, translations and a memoir. Now, with Blue Calhoun, Reynolds Price has written the most searching, most passionate, most accomplished book of his long, rich and varied career.  As the book opens, Blue (short for Bluford) Calhoun, the narrator, is compelled to examine his past, from the mid-1950s to the present. For Blue, the '50s were a time when the world was in order and he was, finally, at peace: a recovering alcoholic, he had been sober for nineteen months; his marriage and family life were more satisfying than ever; even his job (selling musical instruments) was the best he had ever had. \"But then that one day fell down on me from a clear spring sky, no word of warning. It tore the ground from under my feet, and everything around me shook the way a mad dog shakes a howling child.\"  April 28, 1956, was the day Blue met a sixteen-year-old girl named Luna. And for the next three decades, their love has borne consequences of the most shattering -- and ultimately, perhaps, healing -- kind for everyone they know. As Blue recounts the years and their events for us -- fervently, tenderly, knowing full well his own deep responsibility -- we are made witnesses to a story of classic dimensions, a story of love and suffering, family and friendship, death and redemption.",

But no moment during a game elicits the roar of the crowd as does the hitting of a home run. And, as witnessed during the past few seasons, home-run fever has swept the fans and the players. Now George Plimpton, famed sports amateur and chronicler of the game of baseball-among many other sports-collects the best writing about the moment a home run is hit. From a memoir of Ted Williams's 1946 All-Star game homer to a fictional visit Babe Ruth made to Lake Wobegon, from Mark McGwire's 69th and 70th home runs to Hank Aaron's pursuit of the Babe's record to Bobby Thomson's \"Shot Heard 'Round the World,\" we see the effects on the athletes and the fans of that ineffable moment when wood hits leather and the ball sails out over the stands.This delightful and absorbing collection is the most complete, most authoritative, and most compelling assemblage of home-run writing ever put together.Includes glorious prose by John Updike, Don DeLillo, Roger Angell, Paul Gallico, Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Robert Creamer, Garrison Keillor, Donald Hall, Rick Reilly, and Rick Telander, among others.",

Responding to this need, Thomas Mann--a reference librarian at the Library of Congress--offers us A Guide to Library Research Methods.      Introducing a distinctive, new approach to the fact-finding process, this book provides not only an exceptional overview of the range of material that exists, but, more importantly, a detailed discussion of both the advantages and disadvantages of using each type of source. Mann's problem-solving technique emphasizes seven different research methods that researchers can apply to any inquiry. Used as a set of easily remembered \"mental pegs,\" these methods enable individuals to get further into a subject more quickly, with less wasted effort.  The seven research methods described include subject heading inquiries, systematic browsing, key word and citation searches, use of bibliographies, computer searches, and talking to people.      A Guide to Library Research Methods should be required reading for every individual who has ever asked the question, \"Where should I start looking to find out about this?\"",

        "Authors": "By Solow, Robert M., Dertouzos, Michael L., and Lester, Richard K.",
        "Description": "Made in America identifies what is best and worth replicating in American industrial practice and sets out five national priorities for regaining the productive edge.What went wrong and how can America become second to none in industrial productivity? This long awaited study by a team of top notch MIT scientists and economists - the MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity - takes a hard look at the recurring weaknesses of American industry that are threatening the country's standard of living and its position in the world economy. Made in America identifies what is best and worth replicating in American industrial practice and sets out five national priorities for regaining the productive edge. Unlike other studies that prescribe macroeconomic cures, Made in America focuses on the reorganization and effective integration of human resources and new technologies within the firm as a principal driving force for long term growth in productivity. Made in America examines the relationship between human resources and technological change in detail and singles out the most significant productivity weaknesses from the myriad causes that are typically cited. These include short\u00c2\u00adtime horizons and a preoccupation with the bottom line, outdated strategies that focus excessively on the domestic market, lack of cooperation within and among U.S. firms, neglect of human resources, technological failures in translating discoveries to products, and a mismatch between governmental actions and the needs of industry. Looking ahead Made in America asserts that industrial performance would improve substantially simply by building on what is best in U.S. industry. It describes representative systems of production that can serve as models of best industrial practice for niche producers, price competitive specialized producers, and flexible mass producers. Among the goals singled out as national priorities are the creation of a new economic citizenship that involves well\u00c2\u00adeducated workers as active partners in the reproduction process, a new strategic focus on production, finding a better balance between cooperation and individualism, learning to live in an increasingly international economy, and making proper provision for the future both in terms of capital and human resources. The findings and goals of Made in America are based on such measures of productivity performance as product quality, innovativeness, time to market, and service in eight manufacturing sectors - semiconductors, computers, and office equipment; automobiles; steel; consumer electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals; textiles; machine tools; and commercial aircraft. These measures revealed a large gap between the best and average U.S. practice.",

        "Authors": "By Schmidheiny, Stephen",
        "Description": "a practical introduction to new and necessary methods of running businesses so that the realities of business and the marketplace support the realities of the environment and the needs of human developmentChanging Course is a practical introduction to new and necessary methods of running businesses so that the realities of business and the marketplace support the realities of the environment and the needs of human development. Gathering the expertise of more than 50 leaders of multinational corporations and backed by an array of case studies showing existing best practices, Changing Course provides an extensive analysis of how the business community can adapt and contribute to the crucial goal of sustainable development - which combines the objectives of environmental protection and economic growth. All of its recommendations are linked by the belief that only by allowing market forces to operate freely and integrating the \"polluter pays\" principle into environmental and economic policy can sustainable development be achieved.Changing Course focuses first on the often adversarial relationship between business and government in chapters that discuss full-cost pricing and market signals, energy, capital markets, trade, and managing change. It shows how environmental costs, which are often invisible, can best be factored into production, investment, and trade. And it calls for a rational long-term energy strategy that balances the energy needs for economic development with a policy shift toward the payment of pollution costs and energy efficiency - changes that demand new thinking and increased flexibility by policy makers in both the public and the private sectors.Changing Course then explores business to business relationships, beginning with the sensitive topic of corporate reporting in environmental areas and discussion of how an environmentally conscious firm is managed. Chapters look at optimal products and processes, product stewardship in retail and trading companies, at new practices for such renewable resource industries as forestry and agriculture, and at the need for new long-term partnerships to boost economic development and environmental standards in the developing world.Changing Course concludes with a detailed look at the implications of sustainable development for business in the developing world, where, as former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi pointed out, poverty itself is a great polluter.",

What she discovered was more dramatic still, and from those tales she has crafted a breathtaking work of historical fiction about two dynastic lines, the King and Woods families - the story of the true women of Seguin, and the giants whose destinies touched their lives.Here, Euphemia Texas Ashby King stands firm against the Mexican general Santa Anna and the feared Comanche, Tarantula, and leads the bitter battle for women's suffrage; Georgia Virginia Lawshe Woods defends her household by any means necessary from the sexual blackmail of a corrupt Yankee commandant; and Bettie Moss King fends off wolves, storms, and the Ku Klux Klan as she steers her loved ones through the turbulent birth of modern times. Deeply devoted to family, land, and the state of Texas, passionate and strong-willed, these are extraordinary characters who live, love, and die in a river of time reaching from the battle of the Alamo to World War II.Interweaving the heroic naturalism of Edna Ferber with the magical realism of Texas legend and the real-life history of Sam Houston, Santa Anna, and other historical figures, Janice Woods Windle has transmuted her ancestral provenance into a remarkable work of literary invention and popular appeal.",

Suzette's strong-willed daughter Philomene, who uses a determination born of tragedy to reunite her family and gain unheard-of economic independence... and Emily, Philomene's spirited daughter, who fights to secure her children's just due and preserve their dignity and future.Meticulously researched and beautifully written, Cane River presents a slice of American history never before seen in such piercing and personal detail.*Includes reading group guide",

Now, in this beautiful and very personal book, Mrs. Gore uses both words and photographs to give us an intimate view of her new life at home, her work as a member of the current administration, and her travels around the world.In a lively introductory chapter, Mrs. Gore offers a wonderfully candid self-portrait. She tells the story of how she became a photographer - receiving her first camera as a gift from her husband, Al, working as a photojournalist for The Tennessean, and gradually discovering that she expresses herself best through the images she captures on film. She writes about the causes that she has cared about most, especially those involving the mentally ill and the homeless. And, with surprising frankness, she describes how being part of a presidential administration has affected her children, her marriage, and her daily life.The centerpiece of Picture This is an inspired collection of more than 120 of her recent photographs, both color and black and white. Mrs. Gore has an unusual gift for catching people at their most natural - witness her photographs of the President and Vice President at work, of men and women from a rich diversity of cultures, and of her husband and children during private moments. She has a keen eye for pictures that tell dramatic stories, as illustrated by her eloquent photographs of starving children in Rwanda and homeless people in America.",

        "Description": "Though reticent in public, George Bush has openly shared his private thoughts in correspondence throughout his life. Fortunately, since the former president does not plan to write his autobiography, this collection of letters, diary entries, and memos, with his accompanying commentary, will fill that void. As he writes in his preface, \"So what we have here are letters from the past and present. Letters that are light and hopefully amusing. Letters written when my heart was heavy or full of joy. Serious letters. Nutty letters. Caring and rejoicing letters...It's all about heartbeat.\"  Organized chronologically, the volume begins with eighteen-year-old George's letters to his parents during World War II, when, at the time he was commissioned, he was the youngest pilot in the Navy. Readers will gain insights into Bush's career highlights -- the oil business, his two terms in Congress, his ambassadorship to the U.N., his service as an envoy to China, his tenure with the Central Intelligence Agency, and of course, the vice presidency, the presidency, and the postpresidency. They will also observe a devoted husband, father, and American. Ranging from a love letter to Barbara and a letter to his mother about missing his daughter, Robin, after her death from leukemia to a letter to his children two weeks before Nixon's resignation to one written to them just before the beginning of Desert Storm, the writings are remarkable for their candor, humor, and poignancy.",

Adrift in a rapidly changing world, the Bevans cling to tradition while wrestling with taxes, tree blight, and the need to keep the family skeleton firmly in the cupboard.Enter Maggie, an opinionated American journalist for the hard-hitting show Newsline. Far happier sending dispatches back from the trenches of war-torn anywhere, Maggie is none too pleased at being forced to research a documentary on the decline of England's upper classes. When these two worlds collide, no one is prepared for the fallout.The story of two brothers bound by duty, and one woman who feels bound by no one, Hunting Unicorns is a delightful romantic comedy that explores loyalty, family, and, ultimately, having the courage to risk everything in the pursuit of what really counts.",

Providing a broad overview of the continuum of neurobiologically based conditions, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder thoroughly reviews disorders often found to be comorbid with ADHD, including specific learning disorders, anxiety disorders, depression, anger regulation problems, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and tic disorders. Dr. Silver emphasizes that ADHD is a life disability that affects not only school performance but also family life, peer interactions, and successful participation in sports and other activities. For about half of the individuals with this disorder, it is also a lifetime disability -- thus, interventions must be considered for each phase of life.Addressing day-to-day management issues faced by physicians and mental health professionals who see patients with ADHD, this guidebook discusses such practical concerns as how to make a differential diagnosis, work with children and families in a multimodal treatment setting, manage a medication regimen, and explain ADHD to parents. Covering ways to work with the school system as well as new and controversial therapies, this up-to-the-minute book is essential reading for all who care for individuals with ADHD.",

She wanted to be a wife and mother, to have a happy, peaceful home filled with the laughter of family and friends, to watch her children grow up surrounded by the same warmth and security she knew as a child.It was not to be. In January 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Sarah's husband, James Brady, as his White House press secretary. And on March 31 of that year, a would-be assassin named John Hinckley fired six shots at the president, severely wounding him and taking down Jim Brady as well. One of Hinckley's bullets tore through Jim's brain, causing devastating damage that changed their lives forever.A Good Fight is Sarah Brady's own plainspoken, moving story of what happened to her, to Jim, and to their son, Scott, who was just two when his father was shot. It's a story of great terror, pain and dislocation, but also of triumph, love and transformation. Above all, it's a story about how you cannot know what life will bring.",

        "Title": "Gathering Storm: America's Militia Threat",
        "Authors": "By Dees, Morris and Corcoran, James",
        "Description": "Six months before the Oklahoma City bombing, Morris Dees warned the U.S. Attorney General that the fast-growing militia movement posed serious threats. He saw the possibility of imminent danger that few understood. Dees and his associates had tracked far-right paramilitary groups and their racist leaders since the early 1980s, sometimes using daring undercover operations. In retaliation, his law office had been burned and attempts made on his life.In this revealing account, Dees names names and places, tying together for the first time the events, the players, and the history that gave life to the militia armies now operating across the country. He explains how hard-core racists and neo-Nazi leaders used the deaths of Randy Weaver's wife and son at Ruby Ridge and the Branch Davidian tragedy at Waco to convince thousands that our government was preparing for a war against its own citizens.Gathering Storm goes behind the scenes, beyond the friendly-looking militia leaders seen on TV talk shows, to explore secret paramilitary cells training deep in mountainous back country. Similar fanatics, with close ties and fueled by the same antigovernment zeal, have lived in our midst for more than a decade. These \"super patriots,\" Dees shows, see themselves in a life-and-death struggle to reclaim the country.These militias do not operate in a vacuum but are close cousins to the religious right and ultraconservative politicians. They are fueled by the ban on assault weapons, strident radio talk show hosts, and those who preach hatred of government. Dees suggests ways to combat the militias and offers ideas on how to recapture the political debate.",

The publication of her sexy, offbeat, riotous first novel, Going Down, won Jennifer Belle comparisons from everyone from Dorothy Parker and Lorrie Moore to J. D. Salinger and Liz Phair. In High Maintenance, Belle is back with another brilliantly twisted New York story that is as funny, sad, painful, ridiculous, wild, daring, and lovable as its predecessor.     Set in the manic world of New York real estate, High Maintenance is the story of Liv Kellerman, a young woman who's just left her husband and, more important, their fabulous penthouse apartment with its Empire State Building view. On her own for the first time in her life, she relocates to a crumbling Greenwich Village hovel and contemplates her next move. Before long she finds her true calling: selling real estate. With her native eye for prime properties and an ability to lie with a straight face, Liv finds success and soon is swimming with the sharks-the hardcore, cutthroat brokers who'll do anything to close a deal. Along the way she picks up a maniacally ardent architect who likes to bite her, a few hilarious bosses, strange and exasperating clients, and a gun, and brings them with her on her search for the one thing she's really after: a home.     Belle's gift for creating strange and winning characters and her acute observations of both the absurd and the poignant in everyday life are the hallmarks of her fiction. High Maintenance is generous and unsparing, tough and exciting and terrifically smart?a hot new property on the market.",

She has been called \"a national treasure,\" \"the laureate of real life,\" and \"the most eloquent voice\" of her generation. Twice a week, in her Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times column, Quindlen explores the controversial domain where public and private problems converge: the economy as reflected in the job search of a fifty-year-old manager or the shopper in the checkout line; issues of gender, politics, and privacy as they relate to the judges on the Supreme Court and other public officials. Separately, policy or personal details don't tell the whole story; together, they show the truth.In Thinking Out Loud, Anna Quindlen reveals both what's in her mind and what's at the heart of the concerns that matter. She examines the private dimensions of such public issues as the horror of war, the right to die, sexual harassment, abortion, rape. And she takes us not only into her own life but also into the lives of her subjects, famous and not so famous - a surrogate mother, a First Lady, workers at an abortion clinic, a gay-rights activist. With the sharp eye of a first-rate reporter as well as an original sensibility, humor, and compassion, Quindlen illuminates why public and private issues are sometimes at odds and suggests how to balance priorities.When Anna Quindlen thinks out loud, she movingly gives voice to the thoughts and concerns of millions.",
