For Social Security they lean towards progressive price indexing and personal security accounts. For health care they propose a range of initiatives, including the encouragement of national markets in health insurance, making company-sponsored health savings accounts portable across employers, making tax-advantaged health savings accounts and relatively low-cost catastrophic insurance available to all without employer-sponsored plans, and offering consumer choice within Medicare and Medicaid.

Developing a distinctive approach, the author is concerned not only with the finished works of Michelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, and others, but also with the social background, patterns of recruitment, and means of subsistence of this \"cultural elite.\" He thus makes a major contribution both to our understanding of the Italian Renaissance and to our comprehension of the complex relations between culture and society.An excellent social history of the lives and culture of the artists and artisans which made it possible for the arts to flourish.",

Helvarg also looks at what can be done to stir the waters of seemingly daunting issues such as toxic pollutant runoff; protecting wetlands and sanctuaries; keeping oil rigs off shore; saving reef environments; and replenishing fish reserves.",

A lack of talent didn't help much either. It was not until his father passed away that Turk realized he'd forgotten his childhood dream and had lost the simple joy he'd once found in the game.Deciding that the time for all his pitiful golf excuses was past, Turk embarked upon the golf quest of a lifetime. For twelve months, he'd ignore work and other distractions, and dedicate himself to the game. He'd seek instruction from golf's greatest teachers, put the best equipment in his bag, and play the world's finest courses. His seemingly impossible goal was to take ten strokes off his 16-handicap.With lessons from David Leadbetter, Dave Pelz, and Ben Crenshaw, and with spiritual guidance from great old men like Willie Nelson, George Plimpton, and Byron Nelson, Turk's epic journey carries him from Pebble Beach to Scotland and back again, where he risks everything on one final round for his father. Follow Turk on the journey of a lifetime, and learn to love golf-and life- all over again.",

Even his friend and rival, John Adams, said Jefferson had \"the reputation of a masterly pen . . . and a happy talent of composition.\" Collected here are some of the third president's most memorable passages and most deftly turned expressions.\"The happiest moments my heart knows,\" Jefferson wrote, \"are those in which it is pouring forth its affections to a few esteemed character.\"Citizen Jefferson is a beautifully produced collection of quotations from Jefferson's own private correspondence\u2014to family and friends, political allies, and rivals. It is a testament to his position as a man of letters and an American sage.To his daughter he counseled, \"Take more pleasure in giving what is best to another than in having it yourself, and then all the world will love you, and I more than all the world.\" To a friend, \"Man, once surrendering his reason . . . is like a ship without rudder.\" Or to his country, \"I have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\"Carefully chosen and expertly edited by Jefferson scholar Dr. John P. Kaminski, the quotations are organized by key topics for gentle browsing and indexed for quick reference. These passages reflect the best counsel that Jefferson offered his own and future generations. Citizen Jefferson is the perfect companion for those who admire the Sage of Monticello.",

First, lobbying has grown exponentially during the past twenty years to exercise enormous influence on American politics. It has almost become a new profession in that time, and therefore deserves a new review and evaluation.Second, lobbying has simultaneously fallen under suspicion and engendered critical resentment in some quarters. Its critics would say it supports \"special\" (i.e. narrow and well-funded) interests and is oblivious to the general well-being of our democratic life and process.Third, reputable lobbyists have called, therefore, for a clarification of standards and principles for use within their own ranks and as an explanation to the general public of the goals, objectives, and methods of lobbying to forestall misunderstanding and misjudgment. This clarification would provide the lobbying profession with a normative statement parallel to the codes of conduct and ethical practice of the American Medical Association and the American Bar Association.",

In Virtual Integrity, he sets out to answer an important question: How can we safely surf our values?Approachable and essential for all Web users, this book reveals the vast scope of the current battle, creative new answers to the problem, and practical steps everyone can follow. Delving into more than just commonly discussed issues of Internet gambling and pornography, Lohrmann offers a rare holistic vision for how to avoid \"integrity theft\" and unpacks a revolutionary new paradigm for integrity security.  EXCERPTOver the past 24 years, I've led teams building websites and customer-focused portals that have changed the way citizens and businesses interact with government - for the better.  Since working for the National Security Agency in the 1980s, I've circled the globe fixing computers, battling hackers, stopping computer viruses, and taking on a never-ending list of \"bad guys.\" America still faces serious challenges from foreign threats, and many books have been written and websites developed on all aspects of cybersecurity, organized crime, and protecting your confidential information. I've seen firsthand a lot of these threats and abuses of Internet capabilities. But in the past few years, an even more troubling trend has grabbed my attention. I am referring to an extraordinary increase in the numbers of temptations we face in cyberspace. New seductions are cleverly packaged as \"innovative opportunities\" that are really appeals to engage in unproductive, harmful, even immoral activities online. A much wider set of questions have arisen that can't be answered by simply blocking spam, installing web filters, or upgrading your antivirus software and PC firewall. These virtual threats can have the net effect of taking away some of the most important things in life. As individuals, institutions, and a nation, we spend significant time battling identity theft online, but we neglect to fight other negative aspects of Internet life that I call \"integrity theft.\" We need a new approach to virtual integrity.",

        "Description": "Award-winning journalist Robert Boston lambastes the zealots of the Religious Right for spreading misinformation about the constitutional principle of the separation of church and state. Boston reveals how a band of ultraconservative religious groups with a political agenda - led primarily by televangelist Pat Robertson - is conducting a systematic war aginst the separation of church and state. The tactics of these groups are designed to exploit unfounded fears and turn the American people against the separationist principle. They will not rest, Boston says, until the United States has become a theocracy.To expose the Religious Right's blatant distortions of U.S. history and correct its skewed analysis of legal rulings, Boston objectively reviews the evolution of church/state relations in the United States and looks at how the separation principle has been applied by the courts. He also examines efforts by sectarian groups to win government support for their schools, the school prayer issue, the history of the free exercise of religion, and the controversial role of religion in the public square.Published in cooperation with Americans United for the Separation of Church and State",

This compassionate book acts as a daily devotional companion to hurting people. Designed for adult readers of all ages and stages in the grieving process, it is sensitively written by an author who suffered three miscarriages and the death of an infant son.

Sixty devotions cover the many stages of grieving, including readings for holidays, birthdays, and special occasions, when grief can be particularly painful. Readers will walk away from the short thematic devotions and feel validated, connected to someone who knows how they truly feel, and with renewed hope in God. Friends and family members who sincerely want to help the grieving can give this book as a meaningful, beneficial expression of their love and concern.",

The Colonial Revival in architecture was one fruit of this nostalgia; another was the insightful chronicles of social history in earlier days written by Alice Morse Earle.Following the success of her book Home Life in Colonial Days, Alice Morse Earle wrote a detailed and fascinating account of American children and their lives from the very earliest settlers to the first decades of the new republic. Covering everything from dress to toys, schools to play, discipline and religion, she described in highly readable prose a child's life in the days before the railroad and telegraph. Her book has endured for a century, enthralling readers and inspiring scholars to new research into the field.",

RadicalWomanhood seeks to equip new believers and long-time Christians alike,  exposing the anti-God agenda of the three waves of feminism to date and presenting  the pro-woman truth of the Scriptures. Illustrated with numerous personal testimonies,  this book will dig deep into the Word and show how it can be lived out today. The  foundation and core message of Radical Womanhood is consistent with the  traditional complementarian teaching on biblical womanhood. However, the target  audience, tone, and style are radically different. Most books on this subject take  a heavily didactic tone that assumes an awareness of Christian lingo and a high  degree of spiritual maturity. Radical Womanhood has the narrative approach  appreciated by postmodern readers, but still incorporates solid, biblically-based  teaching for personal application and growth.",

Wendel s research at the National Archives and the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., reveals that the balloons touched down in the U.S. more than 300 times from 1944 to 1945. The balloons proved to be a better weapon than the Imperial Army ever knew. One sailed as far east as Michigan. At one point, the Japanese high command considered replacing the incendiary bombs with nerve and gas warfare. But it never came to that largely because of the U.S. military s ability to keep a secret.",

        "Title": "The Ayatollah Begs to Differ: The Paradox of Modern Iran",
        "Authors": "By Majd, Hooman",
        "Description": "A revealing look at Iran by an American journalist with an insider\u2019s access behind Persian wallsThe grandson of an eminent ayatollah and the son of an Iranian diplomat, now an American citizen, Hooman Majd is, in a way, both 100 percent Iranian and 100 percent American, combining an insider\u2019s knowledge of how Iran works with a remarkable ability to explain its history and its quirks to Western readers. In The Ayatollah Begs to Differ, he paints a portrait of a country that is fiercely proud of its Persian heritage, mystified by its outsider status, and scornful of the idea that the United States can dictate how it should interact with the community of nations.With wit, style, and an unusual ability to get past the typical sound bite on Iran, Majd reveals the paradoxes inherent in the Iranian character which have baffled Americans for more than thirty years. Meeting with sartorially challenged government officials in the presidential palace; smoking opium with an addicted cleric, his family, and friends; drinking fine whiskey at parties in fashionable North Tehran; and gingerly self-flagellating in a celebration of Ashura, Majd takes readers on a rare tour of Iran and shares insights shaped by his complex heritage. He considers Iran as a Muslim country, as a Shiite country, and, perhaps above all, as a Persian one. Majd shows that as Shiites marked by an inferiority complex, and Persians marked by a superiority complex, Iranians are fiercely devoted to protecting their rights, a factor that has contributed to their intransigence over their nuclear programs. He points to the importance of the Persian view of privacy, arguing that the stability of the current regime owes much to the freedom Iranians have to behave as they wish behind \u201cPersian walls.\u201d And with wry affection, Majd describes the Persian concept of ta\u2019arouf, an exaggerated form of polite self-deprecation that may explain some of Iranian President Ahmadinejad\u2019s more bizarre public moments.  With unforgettable portraits of Iranians, from government figures to women cab drivers to reform-minded Ayatollahs, Majd brings to life a country that is deeply religious yet highly cosmopolitan, authoritarian yet with democratic and reformist traditions\u2014an Iran that is a more nuanced nemesis to the United States than it is typically portrayed to be.",
