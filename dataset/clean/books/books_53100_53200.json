        "Authors": "By Oram, Andrew (EDT)",
        "Description": "The term \"peer-to-peer\" has come to be applied to networks that expect end users to contribute their own files, computing time, or other resources to some shared project. Even more interesting than the systems' technical underpinnings are their socially disruptive potential: in various ways they return content, choice, and control to ordinary users.While this book is mostly about the technical promise of peer-to-peer, we also talk about its exciting social promise. Communities have been forming on the Internet for a long time, but they have been limited by the flat interactive qualities of email and Network newsgroups. People can exchange recommendations and ideas over these media, but have great difficulty commenting on each other's postings, structuring information, performing searches, or creating summaries. If tools provided ways to organize information intelligently, and if each person could serve up his or her own data and retrieve others' data, the possibilities for collaboration would take off. Peer-to-peer technologies along with metadata could enhance almost any group of people who share an interest--technical, cultural, political, medical, you name it.This book presents the goals that drive the developers of the best-known peer-to-peer systems, the problems they've faced, and the technical solutions they've found. Learn here the essentials of peer-to-peer from leaders of the field:Nelson Minar and Marc Hedlund of target=\"new\">Popular Power, on a history of peer-to-peerClay Shirky of acceleratorgroup, on where peer-to-peer is likely to be headedTim O'Reilly of O'Reilly & Associates, on redefining the public's perceptionsDan Bricklin, cocreator of Visicalc, on harvesting information from end-usersDavid Anderson of SETI@home, on how SETI@Home created the world's largest computerJeremie Miller of Jabber, on the Internet as a collection of conversationsGene Kan of Gnutella and GoneSilent.com, on lessons from Gnutella for peer-to-peer technologiesAdam Langley of Freenet, on Freenet's present and upcoming architectureAlan Brown of Red Rover, on a deliberately low-tech content distribution systemMarc Waldman, Lorrie Cranor, and Avi Rubin ofAT&T Labs, on thePublius project and trust in distributed systemsRoger Dingledine, Michael J.

Writer Gary Reed is joined by 47 different artists to bring forth this unique look at one of the longest running series in independent comics. Deadworld has been recently nominated for various awards including the Shel Dorf Fan Awards, Comic Monsters, and the Ghastlies. If you haven't read Deadworld yet, this is a fantastic entry to get a feel for the world of the dead...and if you're already a Deadworld reader, what a great way to keep up to date with a few reminders thrown in.9781632940674//The very first issue of Deadworld! A group of teens hide out in a school bus trying to find out what happened and how it has become a world of zombies. The initial group consists of John and his younger brother, Joey. Two friends who are known for their stance on anti-authority and suspected of being dope pushers, Mickey and Dan. Mike, who is the self-appointed leader and his girlfriend, Chris, and Donna who has fallen for Dan. The group tries to figure out what they should do and accumulate supplies. They decide to leave the Baton Rouge area and head west, towards California. But when they meet intelligent zombies, they realize that perhaps, the trek won't be as easy as they thought.9781632940681//The group is on the run in their bus, only to find themselves out of gas. Dan and Mike head off to a small town to gather supplies, leaving the rest of the group. They come across Deake who is running through the woods, plagued by visions. Little is known yet about him, except that he is \"the only one\" left. John recovers as Mike and Dan find themselves trapped in the town of Slaughter. They manage to fight their way out, stealing a truck to head back towards their companions. Unknown to them, King Zombie is on their trail.9781632940698//The teens barely manage to survive an attack while driving through a small city and lose most of their supplies. The bus is deemed unacceptable for our group and when they come across a riverboat on the Mississippi River, they figure it would be safer to be on the water, away from the zombies. Once on the boat, they figure they're safe. They do not realize that King Zombie is leading a massive army of zombies toward the boat and something like water is not going to stop him.9781632940704//The attack begins and most of the group is holed up. To their horror, they find out that young Joey is elsewhere and John has a confrontation with Mike. No one will try to rescue Joey...he has to survive on his own. After hearing screams from Joey, the group decides to split up and find him. They also find out that Dan is gone. The group decides to torch the boat, burning up all of the zombies on board. But two of the teens won't make it.9781632940711//A gateway opens in the sky and from there, come five hideous creatures. Four arms and built for power and speed, these are the Grakken...and they are pure killing machines. The group, camping in the wilderness, is surprised as Deake crashes their camp. Deake fills them in with what he knows. He explains that he has the power to close the gateway and end the zombie menace. The teens come across a family living in a secluded house. Things appear safe...for the moment.9781632940728//King Zombie discovers the whereabouts of the teens and unleashes his demon creatures to retrieve Deake and kill everyone else. Dan, thought dead, arrives on the scene just in time to save as many of the group as he can. But King Zombie has captured Deake and now instructs him to open the portal to the other dimension so the Earth can finally be consumed.9781632940735//The group, now with Dan more in charge, decide to leave. The family stays behind. King Zombie soon discovers that Deake has trouble completing the spell as he doesn't have the necessary books. Dan informs the group that he seems to have some kind of sensory perception towards zombies. The others are doubtful until Dan leads them to where the gate opening is going to occur. Dan stays there as Deake begins the ritual. Dan realizes that he can't save Deake, so he has to kill him to prevent the gate opening. Dan misses his opportunity and is surrounded by zombies.9781632940742//The group is discovered by a helicopter and there are ecstatic that they can now rejoin a civilized force. While on the copter, Dan overhears what the real situation is...they have been rescued only to become \"zombie chow.\" Too late and the group now realize the fate in store for them. Punk and Eddie are two of Bowker's men and they escort the group to the \"layaway\", a holding compound full of prisoners. Inside the dark warehouse, the group discovers some of the family they have left earlier is there...Betty and Julie. The grandfather and father are both dead.9781632940759//Betty explains what happened and how they were captured. She informs them how some of the people are taken away from the compound and never seen again. A strange character that eats bugs attaches himself to the group, and he is known as Percy. Bowker, Punk, and Eddie join Moloch in a special rendezvous to see for themselves the area where the gate opening ritual was held. Mike is with them. The helicopter has a battle with a group of zombies led by King Zombie and Moloch declares that he wants King Zombie captured...alive.9781632940766//Mike is being tortured by hanging upside down from the helicopter over the zombies. Moloch wants answers to what Mike knows but Mike doesn't know what else to tell him. In the prison camp Wolverine continues to tear up the zombies and demands a tougher challenge. Dan and John find a way out of the warehouse via an air duct. As King Zombie watches the helicopter, he is also trailing Deake's footprints. He is stunned when the footprints suddenly disappear.

        "Title": "Made from Scratch: Reclaiming the Pleasures of the American Hearth",
        "Authors": "By Zimmerman, Jean",
        "Description": "In this stunning celebration and reappraisal of the importance of \"women's work,\" acclaimed journalist Jean Zimmerman poignantly addresses the tug that many Americans of the twenty-first century feel between our professional and private lives. With sharp wit and intelligence, she offers evidence that in the current domestic vacuum, we still long for a richer home life -- a paradox visible in the Martha Stewart phenomenon, in the continuing popularity of women's service magazines such as Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, and Ladies' Home Journal -- whose combined circulation of over 17 million is nearly twice the combined circulation of Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report -- and the booming business of restorations, where onlookers get a hands-on view of domestic life as it flourished in past centuries. This book is about the ways home traditions passed from one generation to the next -- baking a birthday cake from scratch, cherishing family heirlooms, or discovering the satisfaction of piecing a quilt -- sustain our souls, especially in our ever more processed, synthetic world, where we buy \"homemade\" goods and fail to see the irony in that.  Made from Scratch tells the story of the unsung heroines of the hearth, investigating the history of female domesticity and charting its cultural changes over centuries. Zimmerman traces the lives of her own family's homemakers -- from her tiny but indomitable grandmother, who managed a farm, strangled chickens with her bare hands, and sewed all the family clothing, to her mother, who rejected her country upbringing yet kept a fastidious suburban home where the gender divide stayed firmly in place, to her own experiences as a wife and mother weaned on the Women's Movement of the 1970s, with its emphatic view that housework was a dirty word and that the domestic sphere was to be fled rather than cherished. In this book Zimmerman questions the unexamined trade-off we have made in a shockingly brief time span, as we've \"progressed\" from home-raised chickens to frozen TV dinners to McNuggets from the food court at the mall. What is lost when we no longer engage, as individuals and as a community, in the ancient rituals of food, craft, and",

        "Description": "Dereck and Beverly Joubert have lived among lions for most of their adult lives. Few people anywhere are on such intimate terms with these awe-inspiring creatures, and fewer still are the naturalists who can claim to have seen, let alone shared, their nocturnal forays. For unlike their East African cousins, the great cats of Savuti, a remarkable natural enclave just north of Botswana's Okavango Delta, do almost all of their stalking and killing at night when the moon is just a sliver in the sky.  Over a hundred breathtaking full-color images captured by Beverly Joubert's ever-watchful camera represent not just superb wildlife photography but a priceless record of a little-known natural phenomenon. They create a portrait of the Savuti lions at rest, at play, and on the shadowy hunts that end in a sudden, explosive kill, offering a rare glimpse of the lithe power and ruthless beauty that have mesmerized humans for millennia. Dereck Joubert's detailed and engaging text documents years of observation, providing invaluable insight into the biology, behavior, and social structure of an elusive species; at the same time he brings to life the individual animals the Jouberts came to know so well: Maome, the matriarch whose clan played together every evening; Ntchwaidumela, the bold and unflappable male who defied a charging elephant; Sequela, the old exile who returned to spend his last days with his pride, and many more.  Last but by no means least, Hunting With the Moon is a chronicle of human dedication, a deeply personal account of a couple who have devoted their lives to understanding and protecting the magnificent beasts who prowl these pages in all their majestic grace. It's an extraordinary book, filled with stunning images, fascinating facts, and vivid anecdotes -- a once-in-a-lifetime chance to enter the enthralling, unforgettable world of lions in the wild.",

Captured as it has been by the Soft Green oligarchy of scientists, regulators, and lawyers, modern environmentalism does not conserve forests, oceans, lakes, and streams - it hastens their destruction. For all its scientific pretension, Soft Green is not green at all. Its effects are the opposites of green.This book lays out the alternative: a return to Yellowstone and the National Forests, the original environmentalism of Theodore Roosevelt and the conservation movement. Chapter by chapter, Hard Green takes on the big issues of environmental discourse from scarcity and pollution to efficiency and waste disposal. This is the Hard Green manifesto: Rediscover T.R. Reaffirm the conservationist ethic. Expose the Soft Green fallacy. Reverse the Soft Green agenda. Save the environment from the environmentalists.",

So now that you're here at this new stage of life, the question before you is, what are you going to make of it?This book will help you find your answer and assist you in developing a plan for your grandparenting. It will dispel the myths and \"tell it like it is.\" You'll learn that other grandparents feel just as you do. It will guide you to become aware of the possibilities, encourage you to trust your intuition, and teach you how to set goals so that you can make the most of this essential role. Just as babies don't come with instructions for parents, they certainly don't come with instructions for grandparents!The joys of grandparenting are available to all. It's healthy for us, the older generation, to nurture the young. It is our natural task to influence the future in this way. There are no requirements for a grandparent to be of a certain color, educational level, lifestyle or economic class. However, just loving our children and grandchildren is not enough. The joy comes from  our ingenuity, energy and determination to provide stability and purpose. It is ours for the doing.",

        "Authors": "By Lessing, Doris May",
        "Description": "A highly personal story about returning to her African roots by the eminent British writer, African Laughter is also a rich and penetrating portrait of Doris Lessing's homeland. In it she recounts the visits she made to Zimbabwe in 1982, 1988, 1989 and 1992, after being exiled from the old Southern Rhodesia for twenty-five years for her opposition to the white minority government.The visits constitute an unforgettable journey to the heart of a country whose history, landscape, people and spirit are evoked by Lessing in a dazzling narrative of vivid detail and poignant scenes. Swooping from the verandahs to the grass roots and back again, noting the kinds of changes that can be appreciated only by one who has lived there before, Lessing embraces every facet of life in Zimbabwe from the lost animals of the bush to political corruption, from AIDS to a successful communal enterprise created by poor rural blacks. She talks with white farmers and black storytellers, reflecting on the easy mix of races in Zimbabwe today, in contrast with the racism of the past. She admires the new role of women in bringing about revolutionary social change.African Laughter is a book about memory. Lessing evokes her childhood on an isolated farm in the bush, her parents and brother. And she explores the often unexpected ways in which elements of the past - African traditions and white customs - survive and knit themselves into contemporary life.A passionate, profound and utterly original book, African Laughter uses memory and reminiscence together with recent experience to create an impressionistic picture of a country in the process of energetic change.",

        "Description": "Everyone remembers age thirteen. For Alison Glass, it was the year she moved to Weston, Connecticut, with her bohemian parents and her horse, Jazz. Back then life was about trying to navigate the hypocrisies of an unfamiliar affluent town and figuring out how she might blend in at school. Shy, observant, and in a back brace for scoliosis, Alison found strength in an unlikely friendship with Kate Hamilton, the charismatic but troubled daughter of an egomaniacal new age guru - the \"sham shaman\" - and his substance-loving wife.The year was 1975. As the sincere but comically misguided \"Women of History\" plan the town's bicentennial celebration (complete with red, white, and blue Porta-Potties), the girls escape into the world of their horses. Seeking refuge from the chaos surrounding them, Alison and Kate ride the trails on the edge of suburbia and make up their own alternate history. Aurelie Sheehan sends us reeling back to our adolescent years, making them feel as real as when we first lived them while deftly revealing their lingering influence on the adults we become. With the clarity of hindsight, Alison looks back on the giddy highs and crushing lows that made her the person she was at thirteen, and the friendship that simply couldn't survive the weight of the shadows under which it was forged.Set against the backdrop of the disturbingly reckless and often hilariously tacky 1970s, History Lessons for Girls is at once an emotional inquest and an elegy for a friendship that meant everything.",

From his meetings with President Bill Clinton to his hiring of Al Franken as his marquee on-air talent, Drobny has plenty to say about where our nation's government is heading - and why the news media must stop being a slave to its corporate-owned puppeteers.This book shares numerous anecdotes of what its like to be a player in the Democratic Party, including his meetings with Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, and presidential candidates John Kerry, Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt.I'm here to show the nay-sayers are wrong, says Drobny. You can launch a radio network successfully despite the challenges to get funding, despite the right-wing media's slanted coverage and despite getting no cooperation from major distributors or station groups. The liberal voice needs to be heard and here it is.",

        "Description": "Unstoppable force, meet immovable object. Scene: the World Bank, a mighty development kingdom of many fiefs, its ten thousand employees operating in some one hundred countries responsible for tens of billions of dollars in aid to the world's poorest nations. Enter: James Wolfensohn, the smooth global deal maker and power broker of gargantuan appetites who has furiously worked his many connections to become the World Bank's president. Over the course of his dazzling career, Wolfensohn seduced everything in his way-surely the development gurus of the bank would be no different? Even if this wasn't much the crowd for private jets and homes in Jackson Hole, for friendship with European royalty and Harrison Ford, for fencing at the Olympics and playing the cello in Carnegie Hall with Yo-Yo Ma, surely they would see what a noble sacrifice James Wolfensohn had made in walking away from his multimillion-dollar income?  Not exactly. In 1995, Wolfensohn struck the World Bank like a whirlwind, determined to reinvent the institution founded by Franklin Roosevelt and his World War II allies. Never has the World Bank's work been more important, more in the public eye, or more controversial than in the past nine years when challenges from global financial crises to AIDS to the emergence of terrorist sanctuaries in failed states have threatened our prosperity. In Sebastian Mallaby's masterful hands, the story of Wolfenson and his World Bank is a marvelous tour through the messy reality of global development. What John Gutfreund and Salomon Brothers were to the 1980s and John Meriwether and Long Term-Capital Management were to the 1990s, James Wolfensohn and the World Bank are to our time: the emblematic story through which a gifted author has channeled the spirit of the age.",

How to avoid humiliation the second time? What is that quality - we'll call it the X Factor - that all winners, from famous athletes to successful CEOs, seem to possess? Plimpton sets out to find it.The quest for this elusive ingredient is both hilarious and informative, leading from the locker room to the boardroom, with several strange stops in between. Plimpton corners superstars like Bill Russell and Billie Jean King, famous coaches, the chairman of American Express, sports doctors, and M & A king Henry Kravis, and puts the same question to all of them: What is it that allows an individual, or a team, to outperform competitors who are no less gifted, mentally and physically? Their answers run the gamut from motivational rage to new-age meditation, and Plimpton slowly pieces together a definition of this mysterious winning quality.",

Largely avoiding the foreign policy of George W.

We will no longer be passive bystanders to the dance of the universe, but will become creative choreographers of matter, life, and intelligence.The first section of Visions presents a shocking look at a cyber-world infiltrated by millions of tiny intelligence systems. Part two illustrates how the decoding of DNA's genetic structure will allow humans the \"godlike ability to manipulate life almost at will.\" Finally, VISIONS focuses on the future of quantum physics, in which physicists will perfect new ways to manipulate matter and harness the cosmic energy of the universe.What makes Michio Kaku's vision of the science of the future so compelling--and so different from the mere forecasts of most thinkers--is that it is based on the groundbreaking research taking place in labs today, as well as the consensus of over 150 of Kaku's scientific colleagues. Science, for all its breathtaking change, evolves slowly; we can accurately predict, asserts Kaku, what the direction of science will be, based on the paths that are being forged today.A thrilling, unique narrative that brings together the thinking of many of the world's most accomplished scientists to explore the world of the future, Visions is science writing at its best.",

Patterson, the road to the presidency has led through the newsrooms, which in turn impose their own values on American politics. The results are campaigns that resemble inquisitions or contests in which the candidates' game plans are considered more important than their goals. Lucid and aphoristic, historically informed and as timely as a satellite feed, Out of Order mounts a devastating inquest into the press's hijacking of the campaign process -- and shows what citizens and legislators can do to win it back.",

She struck them as little short of blasphemous in her expressed passion for the works of Shakespeare and for referring to the Bible as \"literature.\" Other versions of Emily are revealed in letters exchanged between her first editor, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and a Miss Mann, who as a young teacher tried to instruct Emily in conventional Christian doctrine; in a letter from the only man ever to take her picture; in letters to and from her sister and her sister-in-law; and in letters from Emily herself, found after her death, to the person she addressed as \" Master.\" The revelations accrue until the poignant ending involves every member of the cast of this dramatic book, which combines the thorough knowledge of",
