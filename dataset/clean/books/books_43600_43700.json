        "Description": "Twenty-five-year-old Dante Brown is down and out in L.A. After doing a stretch of hard time in juvenile jail, he cleaned up his act as a computer techie-only to be laid off when the economy went south. Now he's facing a mountain of unpaid bills, a car on its last legs, imminent eviction, and a snowball's chance in hell with Pam, a sexy waitress/actress on the hunt for a man with means.  Enter Scamz, a slick brother from Dante's checkered past whose successful, illegal business associations keep him in custom-tailored suits, a Benz CL600, and a lavish Hollywood mansion with his pick of gorgeous women. Dante is determined to stay straight...after one last con that could put him back on top. But he gets pulled in deeper when his old friend Jackson, who's $16,000 behind in child support, becomes part of the sting. The icing on the cake is Pam who, seduced by the easy money, suddenly finds Dante irresistible...until everything goes wrong.  A provocative and seductive story of contemporary men and women on the move and on the make, living large-and small-in L.A., Thieves' Paradise is this phenomenally gifted author \"at the top of his game\" (Chicago Defender).",

        "Title": "All That We Can Be: Black Leadership And Racial Integration The Army Way",
        "Authors": "By Moskos, Charles C. and Butler, John Sibley",
        "Description": "When one thinks of those institutions in America that have been at the vanguard of social change, the U.S. Army does not spring readily to mind. And yet, over the past two decades, the Army has become the most successfully integrated institution in America - from the ranks of the lowliest privates to the highest level of command. What has made the Army's experience so striking is that this success was achieved without resort to numerical quotas or manipulation of test scores, nor has the promotion of black officers engendered the racial resentment that has become all too common in business, government, and higher education.All That We Can Be reveals how the Army created such a smoothly functioning system, how it works, and how this military model can be adapted to fit the needs of civilian society. The authors, Charles C. Moskos and John Sibley Butler, are the nation's foremost authorities on race relations in the armed forces, and together they bring more than a half-century's experience observing and analyzing how the Army gets things done. Moskos and Butler point out that what makes the Army unique is that it is the only place in America where blacks routinely boss around whites, and in this book they lay out the path by which the Army has promoted excellence across racial lines. Colin Powell is the most visible symbol of the Army's success, for his career has exemplified the guiding tenets of the Army system of merit-based recruitment, training, and promotion.There are many surprising findings in this book, especially for those who may think of the Army as a hidebound and rigidly hierarchical organization. Moskos and Butler reveal how the Army has created a transracial \"Afro-Anglo\" culture that fosters organizational effectiveness, and they make the point that black advancement does not depend upon the absence of racists in an organization so long as opportunity channels exist for minorities. Moskos and Butler also describe in detail the success of the Army's educational programs in developing the academic skills of underprivileged recruits - blacks and whites alikeand which could serve the needs of civilian youth as well.",

These are the Gifts of Age: the time, the freedom, and hopefully the wisdom to develop creative new images of oneself and one's place in the complexities of a long life. All of the women in this book are more than sixty-five years of age, and included are such well-known personalities as Julia Child, M.F.K. Fisher, Joan Baez Senior, and Louise M. Davies. No two have followed the same path, but each has been successful in achieving some new, frequently unanticipated distinction in her latter years. Gifts of Age is a fascinating insight into just how productive one's extended life can be, and inspiration for anyone who believes that the creative talent for living need not diminish with the passage of years.",

        "Authors": "By Harvey, Stephanie and Goudvis, Anne",
        "Description": "Since its publication in 2000, Strategies That Work has become an indispensable resource for teachers who want to explicitly teach thinking strategies so that students become engaged, thoughtful, independent readers.  In this revised and expanded edition, Stephanie and Anne have added twenty completely new comprehension lessons, extending the scope of the book and exploring the central role that activating background knowledge plays in understanding. Another major addition is the inclusion of a section on content literacy which describes how to apply comprehension strategies flexibly across the curriculum. The new edition is organized around four sections:Part I highlights what comprehension is and how to teach it, including the principles that guide practice, a review of recent research, and a new section on assessment. A new chapter, Tools for Active Literacy: The Nuts and Bolts of Comprehension Instruction, describes ways to engage students in purposeful talk through interactive read alouds,  guided discussion and written response.Part II contains lessons and practices for teaching comprehension. A new first chapter emphasizes the importance of teaching students to monitor their understanding before focusing on specific strategies. Five lessons on monitoring provide a sound basis for launching comprehension instruction. At the end of each strategy chapter, the authors outline learning goals and ways to assess students' thinking, sharing examples of student work, and offering suggestions for differentiating instruction.Part III, Comprehension Across the Curriculum is new. Comprehension strategies are essential for content-area reading, where information can be challenging, and presented in unfamiliar formats. This section includes chapters on social studies and science reading, topic study research, textbook reading and the genre of test reading.Part IV shows that kids need books they can sink their teeth into and the updated appendix section recommends a rich diet of fiction and nonfiction, short text, kid's magazines, websites and journals that will assist teachers as they plan and design comprehension instructionThrough its focus on instruction that is responsive to kids' interests and learning needs, the first edition of Strategies That Work helped transform comprehension instruction for teachers across the country. For them, this new edition will be a welcome extension of that work. Those coming to it for the first time will find a current and essential resource. When readers use these strategies, they enjoy a more complete, thoughtful reading experience. Engagement is the goal. When kids are engaged in their reading they enhance their understanding, acquire knowledge, and learn from and remember what they read. And best yet, they will want to read more!",

        "Description": "My Detachment is a war story like none you have ever read before, an unromanticized portrait of a young man coming of age in the controversial war that defined a generation. In an astonishingly honest, comic, and moving account of his tour of duty in Vietnam, master storyteller Tracy Kidder writes for the first time about himself. This extraordinary memoir is destined to become a classic.Kidder was an ROTC intelligence officer, just months out of college and expecting a stateside assignment, when his orders arrived for Vietnam. There, lovesick, anxious, and melancholic, he tried to assume command of his detachment, a ragtag band of eight more-or-less ungovernable men charged with reporting on enemy radio locations. He eventually learned not only to lead them but to laugh and drink with them as they shared the boredom, pointlessness, and fear of war. Together, they sought a ghostly enemy, homing in on radio transmissions and funneling intelligence gathered by others. Kidder realized that he would spend his time in Vietnam listening in on battle but never actually experiencing it. With remarkable clarity and with great detachment, Kidder looks back at himself from across three and a half decades, confessing how, as a young lieutenant, he sought to borrow from the tragedy around him and to imagine himself a romantic hero. Unrelentingly honest, rueful, and revealing, My Detachment gives us war without heroism, while preserving those rare moments of redeeming grace in the midst of lunacy and danger. The officers and men of My Detachment are not the sort of people who appear in war movies\u2013they are the ones who appear only in war, and they are unforgettable.",

        "Description": "Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText. To order the Enhanced Pearson eText packaged with a bound book, use ISBN 0133387445.Born of the author's own experience working with teachers and principals,Action Research, 5/e, provides a research-based step-by-step outline of how to do action research. The author guides teachers and administrators through the action research process via numerous concrete illustrations; positioning it as a fundamental component of teaching. The Enhanced Pearson eText features embedded video.From reviews of the book: \u201cMills\u2019 writing style is informative, direct, and personalized and his expertise as a researcher is evident throughout the textbook. He fully understands the uniqueness of teacher-centered research. . . . The language and the illustration cater to the classroom research contexts and it is easy to understand and apply.\u201d\u2014Adel Al-Bataineh, Illinois State University \u201cThe book emphasizes the importance of reflection and creating an action plan. . . . Examples of action research papers are included. There are study sites, videos, slides and other supplemental materials available for the students to consult for ancillary learning. The writing style is clear, interesting and engaging. Throughout the text, Mills offers the reader a research scenario that helps to position him or her around the theme of the chapter and context of the research phase. This helps to alleviate some of the anxiety students of action research may experience as they begin each aspect of the action research process.\u201d\u2014Beverly Melenyzer, California University of Pennsylvania\u201c[T]he survey examples, SurveyMonkey, and direct observation examples are very good, as well as the informal interview, making records, [and] data collection techniques. . . . [T]he section on re-aligning the focus and action research plan is very good. I find my students doing this as they are doing their literature review and understanding that they need to narrow the scope of their research. I like the example of doing AR in Ch. 6. . . . I like the inclusion of the data analysis, sample interview and other models of how to analyze data. . . . The key strengths of the project are the authentic examples of AR.\u201d\u2014Mary Frances Agnello, Texas Tech UniversityFeatures Balanced coverage of data collection and analysis techniques for qualitative, quantitative and mixed methodsChapter 4, Data Collection Techniques, covers collection techniques for the most frequently used qualitative and quantitative data, including observations, interviews, teacher-made tests, and standardized test data.Chapter 6, Data Analysis and Interpretation, guides students through data analysis and provides techniques, coding guidelines, and examples for analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data.Inclusion throughout the text of digital research tools that can be used by action researchers through each phase of the a",

        "Title": "American Creation: Triumphs and Tragedies at the Founding of the Republic",
        "Authors": "By Ellis, Joseph J.",
        "Description": "From the prizewinning author of the best-selling Founding Brothers and American Sphinx, a masterly and highly ironic examination of the founding years of our country. The last quarter of the eighteenth century remains the most politically creative era in American history, when a dedicated and determined group of men undertook a bold experiment in political ideals. It was a time of triumphs; yet, as Joseph J. Ellis makes clear, it was also a time of tragedies\u2014all of which contributed to the shaping of our burgeoning nation.From the first shots fired at Lexington to the signing of the Declaration of Independence to the negotiations for the Louisiana Purchase, Ellis guides us through the decisive issues of the nation\u2019s founding, and illuminates the emerging philosophies, shifting alliances, and personal and political foibles of our now iconic leaders\u2014Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, and Adams. He casts an incisive eye on the founders\u2019 achievements, arguing that the American Revolution was, paradoxically, an evolution\u2014and that part of what made it so extraordinary was the gradual pace at which it occurred. He shows us why the fact that it was brought about by a group, rather than by a single individual, distinguished it from the bloodier revolutions of other countries, and ultimately played a key role in determining its success. He explains how the idea of a strong federal government, championed by Washington, was eventually embraced by the American people, the majority of whom had to be won over, as they feared an absolute power reminiscent of the British Empire. And he details the emergence of the two-party system\u2014then a political novelty\u2014which today stands as the founders\u2019 most enduring legacy.But Ellis is equally incisive about their failures, and he makes clear how their inability to abolish slavery and to reach a just settlement with the Native Americans has played an equally important role in shaping our national character. He demonstrates how these misjudgments, now so abundantly evident, were not necessarily inevitable. We learn of the negotiations between Henry Knox and Alexander McGillivray, the most talented Indian statesman of his time, which began in good faith and ended in disaster. And we come to understand how a political solution to slavery required the kind of robust federal power that the Jeffersonians viewed as a betrayal of their most deeply held principles.With eloquence and insight, Ellis strips the mythic veneer of the revolutionary generation to reveal men both human and inspired, possessed of both brilliance and blindness. American Creation is a book that delineates an era of flawed greatness, at a time when understanding our origins is more important than ever.",

In 1999, climber Conrad Anker discovered Mallory's body on Everest and helped solve one of the greatest mysteries in the history of adventure and exploration. In The Lost Explorer,  Anker and historian David Roberts craft a dramatic account of the expeditions of 1924 and 1999, and ultimately capture the passion and spirit of two men driven to test themselves against nature at its most brutal.",
