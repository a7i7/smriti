        "Title": "Our Oldest Enemy: A History of America's Disastrous Relationship with France",
        "Authors": "By Miller, John J. and Molesky, Mark",
        "Description": "Libert\u00e9?  Egalit\u00e9?  Fraternit\u00e9?  Or just plain gall?In this provocative and brilliantly researched history of how the French have dealt with the United States, John J. Miller and Mark Molesky demonstrate that the cherished idea of French friendship has little basis in reality. Despite the myth of the \u201csister republics,\u201d the French have always been our rivals, and have harmed and obstructed our interests more often than not.This history of French hostility goes back to 1704, when a group of French and Indians massacred American settlers in Deerfield, Massachusetts. The authors also debunk the myth of French aid during the Revolution: contrary to popular notions, the French did not enter the war until very late and were mainly interested in hurting their rivals, the British.  After the war, the French continued to see themselves as major players in the Western hemisphere and shaped their policies to limit the growth and power of the new nation. The notorious XYZ affair, involving French efforts to undermine the government of George Washington, led to an undeclared naval war with France in 1798.  During the Civil War, the French supported the Confederacy and installed a puppet emperor in Mexico.In the twentieth century, Americans clashed with the French repreatedly.  The French victory over President Wilson at Versailles imposed a short-sighted and punitive settlement on Germany that paved the way for the rise of fascism in the 1930s.  During World War II, Vichy French troops killed hundreds of American soldiers in North Africa, and diehard French fascist units fought against the Allies in the rubble of Berlin.  During the Cold War, Charles DeGaulle yanked France out of NATO and obstructed our efforts to roll back Soviet expansion. The legacy of French imperial power has been no less disastrous. The French left Haiti in a shambles, got us into Vietnam, and educated many of the world\u2019s worst tyrants at their elite universities, including Pol Pot, the genocidal Cambodian dictator.  The fascist Baath regimes in Iraq and Syria are another legacy of failed French colonialism. Americans have been particularly irritated by French cultural arrogance\u2014their crusades against American movies, McDonalds, Disney, and the exclusion of American words from their language have always rubbed us the wrong way.  This irritation has now blossomed into outrage. Our Oldest Enemy shows why that outrage is justified.",

She barely noticed the red van parked near her, barely noticed the van door slide open as they dashed to the car. The last thing she did notice was the hand reaching out for her and the voice from out of the past - and then the three of them were gone.Hours later, Deputy Chief Lucas Davenport stood in the parking lot, a bloody shoe in his hand, the ground stained pink around him, and knew, instinctively, that this would be one of the worst cases he'd ever been on. A man who could steal children . . . With an urgency born of dread, Lucas presses the attack, while in an isolated farmhouse, Andi Manette does the same, summoning all her skills to battle an obsessed captor. She knows the man who has taken her and her daughters, knows there is a chink in his armor, if only she can find it. But for both her and Davenport, time is already running out.",

The Last Full Measure tells the epic story of the events following the Battle of Gettysburg and brings to life the final two years of the Civil War. Jeff Shaara dramatizes the escalating confrontation between Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant\u2014complicated, heroic, and deeply troubled men. For Lee and his Confederate forces, Gettysburg has been an unspeakable disaster, but he is determined to fight to the bitter end; he faces Grant, the decisive, hard-nosed leader the Union army so desperately needs in order to turn the tide of the war. From the costly Battle of the Wilderness to the agonizing seize of Petersburg to Lee\u2019s epoch-making surrender at Appomattox, Shaara portrays the riveting conclusion of the Civil War through the minds and hearts of the individuals who gave their last full measure.",

But sometimes that place isn't easy to find.  You could look under a bush in your own backyard, where the world seems far away...and you could be a pirate on a desert island.  Or you could sit on an old stump in the woods amidst the glittering sunlight and mossy shadows and be a timber wolf.  You could look by the sea or in the desert or in a cool dark cave, but if none of these places are right, you could come home and discover another quiet place.  Perhaps the very best quiet place of all -- the one that's inside of you.  In poetic and gently philosophical prose, acclaimed author Douglas Wood explores what it's like to find that special place where we all can think our own thoughts and feel our own feelings. Dan Andreasen brings exquisite imagination and thoughtful wonder to words that will inspire readers of all ages to seek out their very own quiet place.",

This carpenter, known as Joshua, first arrived nearly two decades earlier and transformed everyone with his words of peace and actions of love. However, in the years since he left, many of his friends have died and a generation has grown up not knowing him. Now, with the new millenium on the horizon, Joshua reassures everyone by reminding them of the lessons he left them with years before. He explains that God is love, not some monster waiting for people to make one false move and then punish them. But when an immense earthquake strikes just before the new year, and other \"signs of the apocalypse\" seem to abound, Joshua realizes that his wisdom much reach beyond this small town in order to help people throughout the rest of the world.",

        "Description": "Jeff Shaara has enthralled readers with his New York Times bestselling novels set during the Civil War and the American Revolution. Now the acclaimed author turns to World War I, bringing to life the sweeping, emotional story of the war that devastated a generation and established America as a world power.Spring 1916: the horror of a stalemate on Europe\u2019s western front.

Shaara opens the window onto the otherworldly tableau of trench warfare as seen through the eyes of a typical British soldier who experiences the bizarre and the horrible\u2013a \u201cTommy\u201d whose innocent youth is cast into the hell of a terrifying war. In the skies, meanwhile, technology has provided a devastating new tool, the aeroplane, and with it a different kind of hero emerges\u2013the flying ace. Soaring high above the chaos on the ground, these solitary knights duel in the splendor and terror of the skies, their courage and steel tested with every flight.As the conflict stretches into its third year, a neutral America is goaded into war, its reluctant president, Woodrow Wilson, finally accepting the repeated challenges to his stance of nonalignment. Yet the Americans are woefully unprepared and ill equipped to enter a war that has become worldwide in scope. The responsibility is placed on the shoulders of General John \u201cBlackjack\u201d Pershing, and by mid-1917 the first wave of the American Expeditionary Force arrives in Europe. Encouraged by the bold spirit and strength of the untested Americans, the world waits to see if the tide of war can finally be turned.From Blackjack Pershing to the Marine in the trenches, from the Red Baron to the American pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille, To the Last Man is written with the moving vividness and accuracy that characterizes all of Shaara\u2019s work. This spellbinding new novel carries readers\u2013the way only Shaara can\u2013to the heart of one of the greatest conflicts in human history, and puts them face-to-face with the characters who made a lasting impact on the world.",

Jennifer Traig's adolescence took angst to new heights, adding a layer of obsessive-compulsive drama that made ordinary mortifications like bad hairstyles and fashion errors feel like the good parts. Devil in the Details is her unforgettable, hilarious, wrenching account of growing up weird.Jennifer Traig's adventures in obsession began at the age of twelve, when her religious studies introduced her to a body of rules that she hadn't known existed. This unleashed a level of religiosity completely alien to her upbringing. Psychiatrists call this disorder scrupulosity - her family just called it strange. Fervent prayer was only the beginning. On a given day, Jennifer might be putting all her possessions in the washing machine to cleanse them of the pork fumes emanating from the kitchen. Or clipping the lawn according to Old Testament regulations. Or covering her hair with Kleenex while she maintained her constant state of prayer.Jennifer's family treated her condition with humor (\"Ready for your big casserolectomy, Dr. Traig?\" her mother asked as Jennifer scrubbed her hands for thirty minutes before a meal). But her obsessions wore increasingly on her, her family, and her few friends, leading to a crisis that not even joining every single school club, no matter her level of interest, could save her from.",
