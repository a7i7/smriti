        "Authors": "By Baylor, Byrd (EDT)",
        "Description": "Byrd Baylor asked children\u2014Navajo, Hopi, Tohono O'odham, Pima, Apache, Quechan, Cocopah\u2014to choose a story told to them by someone in their own tribe. It should be their favorite story, maybe the best story in the world. That story would be their gift to other tribes, to other children. It would share some of the oldest magic of the Indian world.At a school in southern Arizona, Byrd Baylor saw a story about Rattlesnake and how he made the first brush shelter so the Papago people would have shade. This story was told by a Tohono O'odham child.\"As soon as I read the story,\" Byrd said, \"I knew I wanted a special kind of book to hold this special kind of story. It would have to be written by children, not tampered with too much by adults.\"So I took the Rattlesnake story with me for good luck and camped in my favorite places and went to dances and ceremonials along the way...and talked to children in reservation schools. We talked about storytelling in the Indian way. We talked about how it feels to hear stories that aren't made up new and written down in somebody else's book but are as old as your tribe and are told and sung and chanted by people of your own family, your own clan.\"We talked about how it feels to hear stories that go back to the oldest memories of your ancestors, to times when animals talked like people, times when people changed into stars or rocks or eagles, times when the world was still new and there were monsters to be killed and heroes to kill them and gods to teach the first people the first things they needed to know.\"I asked the children (Navajo, Hopi, Tohono O'odham, Pima, Apache, Quechan, Cocopah) to choose a story told to them by someone in their own tribe. It should be their favorite story, maybe the best story in the world. That story would be their gift to other tribes, to other children. It would be sharing some of the oldest magic of the Indian world.\"In Arizona, Indians don't tell their stories in summer. The old people say snakes don't like to hear them and sometimes it makes them angry and they come and bite the storyteller. So stories are saved for winter when the snakes are sleeping. In gathering these stories, I saved them for winter too. I did not ask anyone to tell them in summer and I hope whoever reads them now will put the book away during the hot part of the year when snakes are listening.\"Most of the stories in And It is Still That Way are just bits and pieces of longer and more complicated legends, but they are the part the children remember.",

        "Description": "New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult is widely acclaimed for her keen insights into the hearts and minds of real people. Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness.  Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.  My Sister's Keeper examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you? Once again, in My Sister's Keeper, Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity.",

They reject hierarchical rules, rituals, and expectations, and have replaced in-the-box management with a culture based on passion and innovation. They regard their employees not as \u201chuman resources,\u201d but as individuals with unique gifts and talents. And make everyone in the company responsible for the company\u2019s brand and culture. An exciting follow-up to Nuts!, which has sold nearly 500,000 copies in hardcover and paperback, GUTS! proves that it is possible to have fun, live your values, and still make money.",

Their annual awards are widely publicized and valued worldwide for what they say about a company\u2019s commitment to its customers. Now, at last, the company has created the definitive book on how to boost profits by increasing customer satisfaction.

Power and Associates provides an insider\u2019s perspective on some of the most successful companies on the planet. Corporate giants such as Toyota and Staples and local legends like Mike Diamond Plumbing all use customer satisfaction as their key to market dominance.   Satisfaction opens the vault on years of J. D. Power data, quantifying the elusive links between satisfaction and customer loyalty, market share, and profits. The book provides extensive coverage of the varying touchpoints of consumer satisfaction\u2014covering every type of business from service providers to product manufacturers\u2014and shows companies in detail how to make a commitment to consumers at the highest levels and translate this commitment into strategies and practices.

        "Description": "Abraham Lincoln never said, \"You cannot fool all the people all the time.\" Thomas Jefferson never said, \"That government is best which governs least.\" And Horace Greeley never said, \"Go west, young man.\" In They Never Said It, Paul F. Boller, Jr. and John George examine hundreds of misquotations, incorrect attributions, and blatant fabrications, outlining the origins of the quotes and revealing why we should consign them to the historical trashcan.       Many of the misquotes are quite harmless. Some are inadvertent misquotes that have become popular (Shakespeare actually said, \"The best part of valor is discretion\"), others, the inventions of reporters embellishing a story (Franklin Roosevelt never opened a speech to a DAR group with the salutation, \"My fellow immigrants\"). But some of the quotes, such as Charles Darwin's supposed deathbed recantation of evolution, falsify the historical record with their blatant dishonesty.  And other chillingly vicious ones, filled with virulent racial and religious prejudices, completely distort the views of the person supposedly quoted and spread distrust and hatred among the gullible.  These include the forged remarks attributed to Benjamin Franklin that Jews should be excluded from America and the fabricated condemnation of Catholics attributed to Lincoln.       An entertaining and thought-provoking book, They Never Said It covers a great deal of history and sets it right.  Going beyond a mere catalog of popular misconceptions, Boller and George reveal how rightists and leftists, and atheists and evangelists all have at times twisted and even invented the words of eminent figures to promote their own ends. The ultimate debunking reference, it perfectly complements handbooks of quotations.",

The authors urge managers to look beyond traditional pricing factors like time and cost, and consider charging for the value of the transformation that an experience offers. Goods and services, say Pine and Gilmore, are no longer enough. Experiences and transformations are the basis for future economic growth, and The Experience Economy is the script from which managers can begin to direct their own transformations.",

Drawing on her decades of work with troubled youth and her wide experience with conflict resolution and reconciliatory justice, bestselling parenting educator Barbara Coloroso offers a practical and compassionate book destined to become a groundbreaking guide to this escalating problem. Coloroso helps readers recognize the characteristic triad of bullying: the bully who perpetrates the harm; the bullied who is the target (and who may become a bully); and the bystander\u2013\u2013peers, siblings, or adults who don't act to defuse the situation. Readers learn: o What bullying is and what it isn't; the three kinds of bullying; and the differences and similarities between boy and girl bullies o How to read the subtle clues that a child is being bullied o Seven steps to take if your child is a bully o Four abilities that protect your child from succumbing to a bully o Why zero tolerance policies can equal zero thinking o Why contempt, not anger, drives bullying, and how to confront this in bullies. o o Bullying is a widespread problem. In a 2001 study by the Kaiser Foundation in conjunction with Nickelodeon TV network and Children Now, 86% of children ages 12\u201315 interviewed said they get teased or bullied at school\u2013\u2013making bullying more prevalent than smoking, alcohol, drugs, or sex among the same age group.

Even classroom teachers and other professionals often find psychological testing, and all its implications, something of a mystery. This much-needed book clarifies what it all means, what questions to ask, what to tell the child, what to do if one disagrees. It explains the many different types of tests, how to understand the results, the issue of confidentiality, and most importantly, how everyone can benefit from the experience.When Your Child Needs Testing is a clear and helpful map to the world of psychological testing that will ease fears and encourage better decision-making among parents and teachers. While especially helpful to them, it is also of great practical value to school psychologists, social workers, guidance counselors, and others who care for children and adolescents. No other book on this subject answers the questions and meets the needs of concerned individuals as practically and assuredly as When Your Child Needs Testing.",

        "Description": "The family is our haven, the place where we all start off on equal footing \u2014 or so we like to think.  But if that\u2019s the case, why do so many siblings often diverge widely in social status, wealth, and education? In this groundbreaking and meticulously researched book, acclaimed sociologist Dalton Conley shatters our notions of how our childhoods affect us, and why we become who we are. Economic and social inequality among adult siblings is not the exception, Conley asserts, but the norm: over half of all inequality is within families, not between them. And it is each family\u2019s own \u201cpecking order\u201d that helps to foster such disparities.  Moving beyond traditionally accepted theories such as birth order or genetics to explain family dynamics, Conley instead draws upon three major studies to explore the impact of larger social forces that shape each family and the individuals within it.  From Bill and Roger Clinton to the stories of hundreds of average Americans, here we are introduced to an America where class identity is ever changing and where siblings cannot necessarily follow the same paths. This is a book that will forever alter our idea of family.",

These \u201cworship wars\u201d prevent us from being the Church.  In Reaching Out Without Dumbing Down, Marva Dawn writes to help local parishes and denominations think more thoroughly about worship and culture so that they can function effectively in contemporary society. She roots her discussion of worship issues in a careful assessment of significant aspects of the present technological, boomer, post-modern society and names criteria by which to judge the various cultural influences. She then sketches essential attributes of worship. Dawn recognizes that the vitality and faithfulness of our personal and corporate Christian lives and the effectiveness of our outreach to the world depend on the character that is formed in individuals and communities.  How can churches best reach out to society without \u201cdumbing down\u201d this essential character formation? Dawn discusses music, preaching, and all the accouterments of worship and offers practical suggestions for choosing the best tools and forms to deepen worship life, nurture faith development, and increase believers\u2019 outreach throughout the universal church and to the world.",
