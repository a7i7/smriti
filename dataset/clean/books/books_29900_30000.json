In addition to the title poem, it includes such masterpieces as \"The Scholar Gipsy,\" \"Thyrsis,\" \"The Forsaken Merman,\" \"Memorial Verses,\" and \"Rugby Chapel.\"Although as a literary critic, Arnold championed the serene poise and impersonal grandeur of the classics, his own poems were often more romantic than classical in nature \u2014 intimate, personal, sentimental, even nostalgic. Yet it is these engaging qualities, together with his poems' lyrical inspiration and lofty meditative character, that continue to endear Matthew Arnold to lovers of poetry.",

        "Description": "On June 17, 1963, the Supreme Court of the United States outlawed voluntary prayer in public schools. One of the most significant rulings of this century, its impact continues to be felt thirty-two years later. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich is expected to introduce a constitutional amendment reinstituting prayer in public schools. Among his most important allies will be William J. Murray, who, in 1963, was the original plaintiff when his mother, Madalyn Murray O'Hair, took her antiprayer campaign all the way to the Supreme Court. And, in an ironic twist of history, William J. Murray has become a passionate advocate for the restoration of prayer in public schools. As the school prayer argument heats up, he will once again be at its center and a figure of national prominence.With Let Us Pray, William J. Murray anchors the debate and reveals the substance behind conservative opinion on this vitally important topic. The book looks at the historical roots of the controversy from the Enlightenment to America's Founding Fathers, from religious tolerance in the colonies to the Bill of Rights. Murray examines the growing secularization of society in the twentieth century from the Supreme Court's decision in Murray v. Curlett to the decline of morality in public schools. Looking for consensus in the midst of controversy, Murray explores what American citizens are thinking and what our national leaders are saying. Finally, he considers what the proposed amendment will accomplish and what the restoration of voluntary prayer in schools would mean for America.",

        "Authors": "By Plotkin, Mark J.",
        "Description": "The fascinating account of a pioneering ethnobotanist\u2019s travels in the Amazon\u2014at once a gripping adventure story, a passionate argument for conservationism, and an investigation into the healing power of plantsFor thousands of years, healers have used plants to cure illness. Aspirin, the world's most widely used drug, is based on compounds originally extracted from the bark of a willow tree, and more than a quarter of medicines found on pharmacy shelves contain plant compounds. Now Western medicine, faced with health crises such as AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, has begun to look to the healing plants used by indigenous peoples to develop powerful new medicines. Nowhere is the search more promising than in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical forest, home to a quarter of all botanical species on this planet\u2014as well as hundreds of Indian tribes whose medicinal plants have never been studied by Western scientists. In Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice, ethnobotanist Mark J. Plotkin recounts his travels and studies with some of the most powerful Amazonian shamans, who taught him the plant lore their tribes have spent thousands of years gleaning from the rain forest.For more than a decade, Dr. Plotkin raced against time to harvest and record new plants before the rain forests' fragile ecosystems succumb to overdevelopment\u2014and before the Indians abandon their own culture and learning for the seductive appeal of Western material culture. Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice relates nine of the author's quests, taking the reader along on a wild odyssey as he participates in healing rituals; discovers the secret of curare, the lethal arrow poison that kills in minutes; tries the hallucinogenic snuff epena that enables the Indians to speak with their spirit world; and earns the respect and fellowship of the mysterious shamans as he proves that he shares both their endurance and their reverence for the rain forest. Mark Plotkin combines the Darwinian spirit of the great writer-explorers of the nineteenth century\u2014curious, discursive, and rigorously scientific\u2014with a very modern concern for the erosion of our environment and the vanishing culture of native peoples.",

Epigrams, aphorisms, and other bon mots gleaned from Wilde's enduringly popular plays, essays, and conversation offer amusing, thought-provoking observations that resonate with truth and profundity beneath their comic surface.Widely acknowledged as the most brilliant talker of his age, Wilde once explained to Andr\u00e9 Gide, \"I put all my genius into my life; I put only my talent into my works.\" This fine collection of nearly 400 quotes, organized by category, contains quotations from both his works and his conversation, including gems from his personal life with which even devotees may be unfamiliar. The result is a splendid introduction to Wilde's mind and personality, embodied in a feast of the English language's most brilliant and perceptive witticisms.",

In Storming the Gates, seasoned political reporter Dan Balz and Ronald Brownstein take us inside this climactic GOP victory and reveal with fresh insights how the assault on sixty years of Democratic governance and domestic programs turned out and its impact on the struggle for power in the 1996 elections. Who are these new Republicans, and how did they revive themselves so quickly after Bush's defeat? What are their prospects for consolidating their electoral success of 1994 into a lasting victory that could permanently realign politics into the next century?",

Christian Europe was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed. The West won victory after victory, first on the battlefield and then in the marketplace.In this elegantly written volume, Bernard Lewis, a renowned authority an Islamic affairs, examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to make sense of how it had been overtaken, overshadowed, and dominated by the West. In a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil, Lewis shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry, industry, government, education, and culture. He also describes how some Middle Easterners fastened blame on a series of scapegoats, while others asked not \"Who did this to us?\" but rather \"Where did we go wrong?\"With a new Afterword that addresses September 11 and its aftermath, What Went Wrong? is an urgent, accessible book that no one who is concerned with contemporary affairs will want to miss.",

To create this newest of her popular anthologies, Michele Slung challenged women--straight and gay, old and young, journalists, poets, academics, women whose job descriptions range from \"anthropologist\" to \"performance artist,\" as well as professional novelists and short story writers--to turn her on. And from across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, a variety of daring and talented women, hearing that she was putting together a book to reflect their most intimate sexual selves, enthusiastically responded.Michele Slung has collected the best of these pieces in Slow Hand, offering page after page of tantalizing sensual adventure for our reading--and feeling--pleasure. But whether the stories stay as close to home as a familiar partner's embrace or whether they move into the darker recesses of extraordinary desires and even more extraordinary experiences, the special quality shared by these tales is their ability to seduce us.So while the mood of this collection is indeed slow (in all the right ways), it's certain that your pulse will quicken.",

She leaves town for the Fourth of July weekend to prepare for a high-profile trial, but when she buys her morning newspaper, her own photo is plastered all over the front page. And the headline-  -- LAWYER MURDERED -- supposedly refers to her. Anne sets out to find her killer, playing dead in order to stay alive.She tries to go it alone but quickly realizes that she'll have to trust people she barely knows -- colleagues who hate her guts, a homicide squad that wants her out of the crime-fighting business, and a new love who inconveniently happens to be opposing counsel. The investigation takes all of Anne's boldness and ingenuity -- plus a pair of red satin hot pants. But her knack for courting trouble makes it almost impossible for Anne to play well with others, defend the lawsuit, and fight her urge to sleep with the enemy. Then an unexpected event places her in lethal jeopardy and leaves her with everything to lose -- including her life.",

As a writer, he produced The Importance of Being Earnest, one of the finest comedies in English, and other classic plays. His one novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is still widely read, as is \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol,\" a powerful poetic indictment of the degradation and inhumanity of prison life.This carefully edited volume focuses on Wilde's poetic legacy. In addition to the title poem, readers will find twenty-three other important works: \"The Sphinx,\" \"The Grave of Keats,\" \"Requiescat,\" \"Impression du Matin,\" \"Panthea,\" \"Silentium Amoris,\" \"The Harlot's House,\" \"To L. L.\" and others. While Wilde's fame rests mainly on his achievements as a dramatist and critic, these poems offer important clues to the themes and subjects that preoccupied him in his other works.",

        "Description": "This outstanding drama of classical antiquity, part of the Cadmean trilogy that includes Oedipus Rex and Antigone, was first presented in 405 B.C. Thought to be among Sophocles' last works, it represents the great playwright's crowning achievement in depicting the painful quest for truth and self-knowledge that leads to spiritual triumph.Blinded and disgraced, Oedipus dwells quietly in Thebes until the kingdom is roiled by discord attributed to his presence and the curse put upon him by the gods. The citizens banish their erstwhile sovereign to years of lonely exile. Finally, the aging king finds refuge in a sacred olive grove at Colonus, near Athens. In the meantime, Oedipus' two sons wage a struggle for control of Thebes. Secure in the protection of Theseus, ruler of Athens, and faithfully attended by his daughters Antigone and Ismene, Oedipus is a towering tragic figure whose final years comprise a moving portrayal of the perseverance of human dignity in the face of an incomprehensible and impersonal universe.Students, teachers, and lovers of classical drama will welcome this inexpensive edition of an enduring literary and theatrical landmark.",
