        "Description": "The greatest sexual pleasure in a person's lifetime is possible in one's middle and later years, asserts Dr. David Schnarch, when a mature sense of self has been achieved and genuine intimacy is possible with another person. At his Family Health Center in Colorado Dr. Schnarch works with couples in long-term committed relationships who want to get emotionally and sexually closer. In Passionate Marriage Dr. Schnarch shares what he has learned about how couples can--and must--simultaneously break through the sexual and the emotional blocks that hold them back from total satisfaction. He counsels that every sexual exchange, from kissing to daring erotic behaviors, is a picture of an entire relationship--a reflection of how you and your partner feel about yourselves and each other outside the bedroom. This respectful, erotic, uplifting, and spiritual guide to sexual and emotional fulfillment makes a passionate marriage within the reach of every couple.",

Now two distinguished geophysicists have discovered a catastrophic event that changed history, a gigantic flood 7,600 years ago in what is today the Black Sea.  Using sound waves and coring devices to probe the sea floor, William Ryan and Walter Pitman revealed clear evidence that this inland body of water had once been a vast freshwater lake lying hundreds of feet below the level of the world's rising oceans. Sophisticated dating techniques confirmed that 7,600 years ago the mounting seas had burst through the narrow Bosporus valley, and the salt water of the Mediterranean had poured into the lake with unimaginable force, racing over beaches and up rivers, destroying or chasing all life before it. The rim of the lake, which had served as an oasis, a Garden of Eden for farms and villages in a vast region of semi-desert, became a sea of death. The people fled, dispersing their languages, genes, and memories.",

But there was another Katie, the one she hid from the world, who was having trouble dealing with the mounting pressures of her young life. And it was this Katie who, with no other means of expression available to her, reacted to her overbearing mother, her absent father, her unforgiving schedule, and her oblivious classmates by turning her self-doubt into self-hatred. And into self-mutilation. In his previous novel, The Best Little Girl in the World, Steven Levenkron brought insight, expertise, and sensitivity to the painful subject of anorexia nervosa. Now he applies these same talents to demystifying a condition that is just as heartbreaking, and becoming more common everyday. Through his depiction of Katie's self-mutilating behavior, she is called \"a cutter\" by her peers, and her triumphant road to recovery, he offers a compelling profile of a young girl in trouble, and much-needed hope to the growing numbers who suffer from this shocking syndrome.",

Based on my personal experiences, most of the stories were previously published in newspapers and magazines over the years. Also included is one poignant tale about a greyhound written by my late father, Daly Highleyman, and published in the 1930s.How would it feel to be on a small sailboat far from land in gale force winds or suddenly subjected to a micro-burst? What was it like to be up at the helm of a 165-foot concrete schooner and, looking down the steps, see water gushing into the cabin? Did Sweet William come back to say goodbye? How can a puppy found starving to death in the Virginia countryside become a master sailor? Explore and discover the answers to these questions and more in Messages from Nature.Progress is being made all over the world, the so-called progress named technology. But another avenue of progress is also being made all over the world and that is the progress of research in the field of creativity. It cannot be ignored that the creative endeavor has a spiritual side to it. Nor can it be said that creative work results from technical know-how. Inspiration is a key factor and its roots may not be as nebulous as they first appear. Genuine creative imagination does not just spring from the right hemisphere of the brain. I believe its roots come from a much deeper place: the heart. In this vein, it is my hope that this little tome will inspire the reader to feel and react to the beauty of nature and the love of animals; in effect, to experience the invaluable life lessons that only Nature can teach.",

One of the first questions Kari asked was, \u201cHow did he get here?\u201d The complex and, at times, heartwrenching answer is told in this magnificent book that encompasses Kari\u2019s personal journey to adoption, Cambodia\u2019s gruesome history of war and genocide, and the stories of two Cambodians\u2014one who escaped the Khmer Rouge\u2019s bloody reign and one who did not.The interweaving stories grab your heartstrings and never let go. From the moment Kari realizes that she will never be an \u201cearth momma\u201d practicing prenatal yoga to years later, as Kari wends her way on the back of a moto-taxi through Phnom Penh\u2019s smog-choked streets trying to make a difference in her son\u2019s birth nation, you can\u2019t read impassively. Bones That Float takes you into the Khmer Rouge jungle where boy soldiers force starving families to labor all day at gunpoint, and it brings you to modern-day Phnom Penh streets where foreign pedophiles purchase the innocence of preteen Cambodian girls. But ultimately Bones That Float\u2014a Cambodian phrase for the sacred that rises above the suffering\u2014is a tale of hope. Kari reminds us that our world is \u201cone big family\u201d and that we cannot\u2014or dare not\u2014turn our backs on people who suffer, in part because of our own country\u2019s foreign policy missteps.

While toiling as a security guard and yearning to reinvent himself, Luke is swept up into the high-flying domain of Paul Tremont. Tremont, the hottest hedge fund hand around, has a penchant for the dramatic and a disquieting need to control. Being Tremont's protege has its perks-Luke trades in his ratty basement apartment for a penthouse view, his gym clothes for designer suits. But there are strings attached, and Tremont is pulling those strings. Why does Tremont need a washed-up boxer? The answer lies not in what Luke is, but who he is. Luke Braden is the only man who can execute Tremont's diabolical scheme. Fidel Castro risks one last trip to the U.S., and one man will be forced to stand in his way. Luke Braden is in for the fight of his life - or the fight for his life. Intricately plotted with unexpected twists and breathtaking turns, The Castro Gene is a knockout.",

On the other hand, she\u2019s thirty-eight, single, and has been writing the same book for the last seven years. And she has been distracted recently: on the same day that Arabella teaches her class she also visits her mother in a nursing home outside the city. And every time they argue. Arabella wants the fighting to stop, but, as her mother puts it, \u201cJust because we\u2019re family, doesn\u2019t mean we have to like each other.\u201d When her class takes a surprising turn and her lessons start to spill over into her weekly visits, she suddenly finds she might be holding the key to her mother\u2019s love and, dare she say it, her own inspiration.

        "Description": "Award\u2013winning journalist David Batstone reveals the story of a new generation of 21st century abolitionists and their heroic campaign to put an end to human bondage. In his accessible and inspiring book, Batstone carefully weaves the narratives of activists and those in bondage in a way that not only raises awareness of the modern\u2013day slave trade, but also serves as a call to action.  With 2007 bringing the 200th anniversary of the climax of the 19th century abolitionist movement, the world pays tribute to great visionary figures such as William Wilberforce of the United Kingdom and American Frederick Douglass for their remarkable strides toward framing slavery as a moral issue that people of good conscience could not tolerate. This anniversary serves not only as a commemorative date for battles won against slavery, but also as a reminder that slavery and bondage still persist in the 21st century. An estimated 27 million people around the globe suffer in situations of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation from which they cannot free themselves. Trafficking in people has become increasingly transnational in scope and highly lucrative. After illegal drug sales and arms trafficking, human trafficking is today the third most profitable criminal activity in the world, generating $31 billion annually. As many as half of all those trafficked worldwide for sex and domestic slavery are children under 18 years of age.",

How do you know how much to take? How much is enough to leave for your neighbors behind you\u2014not just the six billion people, but the wildlife, and the as-yet-unborn?In the face of looming ecological disaster, many people feel the need to change their own lifestyles as a tangible way of transforming our unsustainable culture. Radical Simplicity is the first book that guides the reader to a personal sustainability goal, then offers a process to monitor progress to a lifestyle that is equitable amongst all people, species, and generations. It employs three tools to help readers begin their customized journey to simplicity:>It builds on steps from Your Money or Your Life so readers can design their own personal economics to save money, get free of debt, and align their work with their values.It uses refined tools from Our Ecological Footprint so readers can measure how much nature is needed to supply all they consume and absorb their waste.Combining lyrical narrative, compassionate advocacy, and absorbing science, Radical Simplicity is a practical, personal answer to twenty-first century challenges that will appeal as much to Cultural Creatives and students as to spiritual seekers, policy makers, and sustainability professionals.Jim Merkel quit his job as a military engineer following the Exxon Valdez disaster and has since worked to develop tools for personal and societal sustainability. He founded the Global Living Project to further this work and conducts workshops around North America on this topic.",

We were about to begin the adventure of realigning our lives with our food chain. \"Naturally, our first stop was to buy junk food and fossil fuel. . . .\"Hang on for the ride: With characteristic poetry and pluck, Barbara Kingsolver and her family sweep readers along on their journey away from the industrial-food pipeline to a rural life in which they vow to buy only food raised in their own neighborhood, grow it themselves, or learn to live without it. Their good-humored search yields surprising discoveries about turkey sex life and overly zealous zucchini plants, en route to a food culture that's better for the neighborhood and also better on the table. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, Animal, Vegetable, Miracle makes a passionate case for putting the kitchen back at the center of family life and diversified farms at the center of the American diet. \"This is the story of a year in which we made every attempt to feed ourselves animals and vegetables whose provenance we really knew . . . and of how our family was changed by our first year of deliberately eating food produced from the same place where we worked, went to school, loved our neighbors, drank the water, and breathed the air.\"",

        "Description": "Does God want us fulfilled?Popular psychology says we should be fulfilled.  Advertisements tease us with dozens of ways we can be fulfilled. Many preachers and book promise Christian fulfillment.But in this surprising (and surprisingly liberating) book, Craig Barnes suggests we weren't created to be whole or complete.  With a fresh reading of the early chapters of Genesis, he says that much of our pain and disillusionment arises from wrong expectations of the gospel and of life.Echoing comedian Bob Newhart, Barnes \"would like to make a motion that we face reality.\"  He candidly draws from his own experience as a son, a student, a husband, a father and a pastor to help us see what we all know but are so reluctant to say aloud--that biblical living will not save us from crises or unfulfillment.Barnes writes for anyone who knows that faith must be tough enough to \"hold up in the emergency rooms of life.\" But he doesn't merely help us face reality.  He helps us see how our needs and limitations are gifts, the best opportunities we have to receive God's grace.  Because of that, Yearning may be the most honest and the most helpful book you'll read this year.",

        "Description": "The 2008 presidential campaign got off to an early start with Democratic hopeful Barack Obama and Republican Rudy Giuliani. Violence in the Middle East reached new levels, surpassed only by the escalating violence in Darfur. Gas prices skyrocketed, while the value of the U.S. dollar plummeted overseas. U.S. troops are still in Iraq and the fence along the Mexican border has still not been built. Wildfires, droughts, earthquakes, and tsunamis have fueled the increasing concerns about the threat of global warming, which reached celebrity status with Al Gore's documentary. Selected for clarity of position as well as for exceptional execution, this collection includes the work of Pulitzer Prize-winning artists, the year's major award-winning cartoons, and the best work from Canadian cartoonists.",

Medical reporter Andrealisa \u201cAndie\u201d Rinaldi has just lost her job at the country\u2019s most respected newspaper. (Was it really such a breech of ethics to use her cousin as an interview source?) Her big-city apartment is about to go condo. (Why would she even miss that one-window sweatbox?) Her long-distance romance with a cell biologist is suffering from travel fatigue. (Is love ever possible on a cellular level?) And her twin sister is threatening a relapse of her \u201cimpulse control problem.\u201d (Has Caterina gone off her meds again?)  Worse yet, Andie\u2019s new employer, at the country\u2019s least respected celebrity tabloid, has just learned of her past relationship with millionaire real-estate developer Joel Hartt: Nearly 25 years ago, Andie was Joel\u2019s next-door neighbor and frequent playmate. Now the grown-up Joel is the prime suspect in the death of his daughter, Emma, a young fashion model/actress found strangled last New Year\u2019s Eve. The case was never officially solved, and the tabloids won\u2019t let it die. When her editor orders Andie to use her childhood connection for an exclusive interview with Joel, Andie must cross the river to the two-block-wide town she hasn\u2019t set foot in since she was 12. And she has her own reasons for wanting to avoid this trip down Memory Lane. Back in the old neighborhood, Andie finds herself reliving her preteen world of Magic 8 Ball, Mystery Date, and Hide-and-Seek. Several former classmates from Holy Mother Little Academy (or Holy Moly, as it is known) reappear to replay the past: Her childhood nemesis is now the police detective on the case; her grade-school best friend is Joel\u2019s lawyer; and her first crush has a few secrets of his own. When a new waterfront apartment complex goes up in smoke and another body is found under the smoldering rubble, Andie wonders if this killing was fueled by the first crime\u2014and if the overheated tabloid stories she's been writing helped fan the flames. In this tiny riverside town, shadowed by magnificent cliffs on one side and the world's most treacherous city on the other, Andrealisa Rinaldi finds herself caught between a rock and a hard place. Rekindled rivalries and long-ago loyalties force Andie to confront the ultimate question: Can she go home again?",
