When, during her first visit to the Hill, Senator Strom Thurmond barked at her, \"You gonna fund pornography?\" she knew it would be a rough ride. Nothing had quite prepared her for the role of madame chairman. Her tenure coincided with the ascent of the infamous 104th Congress, presided over by Speaker Newt Gingrich, and its campaign to eliminate the Endowment completely. In Command Performance, Alexander brings a Washington outsider's perspective and an actor's eye for the telling human detail to an anecdote-filled story of the art of politics and the politics of art. And at the start of a new administration in Washington, she reminds us why we need art and why government should be in the business of supporting it.",

        "Authors": "By ROHDE, ELEANOUR SINCLAIR",
        "Description": "Even though nowadays roses are cultivated mostly for their beauty, previous ages have not been so singularly narrow-minded. Even at the turn of the century many people in appreciation of the fragrance, sweet flavor, and medicinal virtues of rose petals, hips, and leaves, still took pleasure in age-old traditional ways of making perfumes, sweet waters, jams, jellies, salads, sauces, and various kinds of confections with roses. They also knew how to crystallize the petals, to preserve the buds, to flavor wines and vinegar with rose leaves, and to use roses in many medicinal ways.With thanks in great measure to the extraordinary modern herbalist Eleanour Sinclair Rohde, this wonderful knowledge has not vanished beyond recall. Her collection of rose recipes between these covers is gathered from the works of a variety of old herbalists (notably Sir Hugh Platt, Gervase Markham, and Sir Kenelm Digby), as well as from her own vast knowledge of traditional herbal recipes. \"Receipts\" from four centuries include: pot-pourris, sweet bags and pomanders (using dried roses with such extra ingredients as mint, cloves, coriander, lavender flowers, and sandalwood); sweet waters (with ingredients like nutmeg, cardamom, orange peel, and cloves) that can be used for washing; perfumes, oil of roses, and \"odoriferous\" candles; and a host of culinary delights like conserves (both petals and hips), sauce eglantine, rossoly, rose jelly, rose hip marmalade, and pickled rosebuds.There are 83 recipes altogether, including instructions on how to dry rose leaves (four ways), how to candy rose leaves, how to preserve whole roses, and how to flavor sugar, wine, vinegar, and honey with roses. Every page is beautifully and distinctively decorated, making this not only a source of special joy for connoisseurs of herbs and herbals, but in all ways a pleasure to read and use for anyone wanting the best rose recipes.",

        "Description": "In this dramatic new perspective on international affairs, Richard N. Haass, one of the country's most brilliant analysts and able foreign policy practitioners, argues that it is hard to overstate the significance of there being no major  power conflict in the world. America's great military, economic, and political power discourages traditional challenges; no ideological fault line divides the world into  warring blocs. India, China, Japan, Russia, and Europe all seek a prolonged period of stability that would support economic growth.    The opportunity thus exists for unprecedented cooperation among the major powers. This is good, because they share vulnerabilities. Globalization, which promotes trade and investment and eases travel and communication,  also facilitates the spread of viruses (human and computer alike), weapons, terrorists, greenhouse gases, and drugs. And the United States, for all its strength, cannot defeat these threats alone.    But opportunity is not inevitability. The question is whether the United States will be able to integrate other countries into global efforts against terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons, genocide, and protectionist policies  that jeopardize global economic prosperity. This compelling book explains why it must and how it can.",

In Creating Emotionally Safe Schools, Jane Bluestein offers a plan to return schools to havens of nurturing and learning. She examines environmental, historical, developmental, psychological, sociological, interpersonal, instructional and administrative factors that contribute to the emotional climate of an educational institution. This is a comprehensive view of what makes a school feel the way it feels, and what we can do to make it feel safe for every child\u2014and every adult\u2014who walks through its doors.  Emotional safety has many dimensions, such as: the impact of the family and early development, childhood stress and coping, the changing role of the school, acceptance and emotional support, respect and belonging, temperament and labels, gangs and violence, instructional strategies, learning styles and multiple intelligences, teacher training and support, and the inherent need for a sense of community. The message Jane Bluestein brings is positive: information, programs and solutions are available that can ultimately make our schools inviting, inspiring, and, yes\u2014safe.

But nothing's changed. Her disappointing day is capped off by the delivery of a huge bouquet of flowers from Carl, with whom she has recently, and bitterly, split. A gesture of reconciliation? Of passive aggression? She's too unhinged to tell.It's My F---ing Birthday unfolds in seven state-of-my-life addresses this hapless high school art teacher writes to herself on consecutive birthdays, as she is determined to break the patterns of behavior that are keeping her down. Her objective: to avoid making the same mistakes over and over and start making some new ones. Through seven outrageously funny years of needling parents, self-absorbed boyfriends, riots, O.J., and Monica - and bigger and bigger bouquets from Carl - she navigates a circuitous (and ultimately successful) route to happiness in a world where everything seems to conspire to the contrary.",

        "Description": "Will the end of superpower rivalry bring greater international harmony--or more volatile and dangerously unpredictable conflicts? Where two massive spheres of influence once divided the globe, now regional conflicts erupt into scenes of tragedy and confusion.  In Africa, the new Europe, Asia, and the Americas, nations chart a bold course toward democracy.  But they cannot break free of old divisions, as ethnic nationalism emerges amidst economic devastation.  Indeed, nations everywhere, however powerful, are buffeted on every side. Their sovereignty is checked by the global economy as well as powerful regional economic and political blocs.  At a time of exceptional ferment, Oxford is pleased to present the most authoritative, timely, in-depth reference available for understanding the people, nations, conflicts, movements, institutions, and issues that dominate the world political stage.     Edited by a team of eminent political scientists, The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World provides readers the depth of coverage, the historical contexts, and the richness of interpretation needed to come to terms with today's volatile international scene.  Drawing on the insights of nearly 500 authors from more than 40 countries, the volume provides comprehensive coverage of international affairs and domestic politics throughout the world.     Articles discuss virtually every nation in the world, and include extensive information on institutions, political parties, leaders, and the sources of political mobilization and conflict.  The volume also includes biographies of more than seventy-five political leaders and thinkers who have shaped the contemporary political world, and detailed discussions of critical historical developments and events, concepts, international law, and organizations.  For example, there is a biography of Richard M. Nixon by Garry Wills and one of Winston Churchill by Martin Gilbert; an essay on development and underdevelopment by Claude Ake; an article on human rights by Aryeh Neier; coverage of such subjects as Hiroshima, sovereignty, and the International Court of Justice by Richard Falk. Todd Gitlin writes on the New Left, Anthony Lake on the Vietnam War, and Robert B. Reich on deindustrialization.  Charlotte Bunch examines feminism, and Zhores A. Medvedev explains Chernobyl.     The Companion also presents major interpretive essays treating seminal contemporary themes such as ethnicity, nationalism, war, gender and politics, and environmentalism, essays that offer readers a deeper, more substantial understanding of headlines day after day. Drawn from a wide range of disciplines, including political science, economics, women's studies, law, anthropology, history, and business, the contributors to the volume provide factual information, new insights, and fresh interpretations as they consider the critical political developments of the twentieth century.      The Oxford Companions have long been respected for their lively and informative presentation of the finest scholarship. (Harper's has called the \"the best reference books in the language.\") The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World maintains this high standard in an accessible, timely, thought-provoking, and comprehensive reference that captures the complexity, vitality, and endless fascination of contemporary world affairs.",

The birth of their daughter Hannah; however, promises to revitalize their relationship. Menley and Adam are determined to rebuild a life together around their precious new baby - unaware that someone in their midst has a very different agenda for them.With no foreboding that it could be a fatal move, Adam decides to return to his roots by renting a house on Cape Cod for the month of August, confident that the tranquillity of the place where his ancestors settled - and where he grew up - will be ideal for Menley and little Hannah. The place they rent is Remember House, an eighteenth-century landmark, built by a sea captain for his bride. It has the sinister legend that the captain deserted his wife on learning of her unfaithfulness, taking their infant daughter with him.When Menley and Adam move into Remember House, strange things start happening - incidents that make Menley relive the horror of the accident in which she lost Bobby, incidents that make her fear for Hannah....Step by step, they are drawn into a dark and threatening web of events that disrupts this seemingly peaceful town. They become involved with Scott Covey, suspected of murder when his wealthy young bride is drowned in a violent squall. Menley, sympathetic to Covey's plight, persuades Adam to take on his case. In the course of the investigation, they become entangled with others - among them, an Alzheimer's victim who may hold a vital clue, a teenage baby-sitter, a flamboyant young woman with a possible link to Covey, and an attractive real estate agent who is part of Adam's past on the Cape.In Remember Me, her most compelling novel, Mary Higgins Clark captures the legends and atmosphere of Cape Cod, where she herself has a home, and the rising terror of people in the grip of menace hovering over their lives.",

He's also struggling to bury his past as a cripple and shed his financial ties to his benevolent \"Uncle\" Ebenezer by losing himself in the thick of London's underbelly. He boards at a brothel in exchange for teaching the mistress how to read and spends his nights dredging the Thames for dead bodies and the treasures in their pockets.Timothy's life takes a sharp turn when he discovers the bodies of two dead girls, each seared with the same cruel brand on the upper arm. The sight of their horror-struck faces compels Timothy to become the protector of another young girl, the enigmatic Philomela. Spurred on by the unwavering enthusiasm of a street-smart, fast-talking homeless boy who calls himself Colin the Melodious, Timothy soon finds that he's on the trail of something far worse -- and far more dangerous -- than an ordinary killer.This breathless flight through the teeming markets, shadowy passageways, and rolling brown fog of 1860s London is wrought with remarkable depth and intelligence, complete with surprising twists and extraordinary heart.",

        "Description": "Occasionally a book for psychotherapists instantly becomes a classic. Not only do clinicians recognize the excellence and importance of the book, but their clients respond enthusiastically to the accurate portrayal of their experiences and the model for healing. With the publication of Healing the Incest Wound, such a classic was born.Incest is not a rare aberrant happening, but a common childhood experience for a substantial minority of children. Since incest is generally hidden and denied, the victims are left to cope with their reactions in an atmosphere that contradicts their reality. Yet all incest is not the same; for instance, one-time fondling by an uncle has different effects from rapes repeated over many years by a stepfather. The book describes these variations and the symptoms, short-term aftereffects, and long-term secondary elaborations of incest from four theoretical perspectives: traumatic stress, developmental, feminist, and loss. The author not only comprehensively discusses the salient issues of incest therapy but also illustrates these with numerous case studies, showing how incest survivors can heal and build a core of self-respect and dignity.",

What is it about the spirit of the people who live there that could produce a music, a cuisine, an architecture, a total environment, the mere mention of which can bring a smile to the face of someone who has never even set foot there?What is the meaning of a place like that, and what is lost if it is lost?The winds of Hurricane Katrina, and the national disaster that followed, brought with them a moment of shared cultural awareness: Thousands were killed and many more displaced; promises were made, forgotten, and renewed; the city of New Orleans was engulfed by floodwaters of biblical proportions\u2014all in a wrenching drama that captured international attention. Yet the passing of that moment has left too many questions.What will become of New Orleans in the months and years to come? What of its people, who fled the city on a rising tide of panic, trading all they knew and loved for a dim hope of shelter and rest? And, ultimately, what do those people and their city mean to America and the world?In Why New Orleans Matters, award-winning author and New Orleans resident Tom Piazza illuminates the storied culture and uncertain future of this great and most neglected of American cities. With wisdom and affection, he explores the hidden contours of familiar traditions like Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest, and evokes the sensory rapture of the city that gave us jazz music and Creole cooking. He writes, too, of the city's deep undercurrents of corruption, racism, and injustice, and of how its people endure and transcend those conditions. And, perhaps most important, he asks us all to consider the spirit of this place and all the things it has shared with the world\u2014grace and beauty, resilience and soul. \"That spirit is in terrible jeopardy right now,\" he writes. \"If it dies, something precious and profound will go out of the world forever.\"Why New Orleans Matters is a gift from one of our most talented writers to the beloved and important city he calls home\u2014and to a nation to whom that city's survival has been entrusted.",

        "Description": "In May 1991, fans of National Public Radio's All Things Considered discovered Marion Winik, a candid and often hilarious personal essayist whose cliffhanger past and action-packed present reflect her entire generation's stormy voyage to maturity. From adolescent rebellion in New Jersey to bohemian decadence in Manhattan to the sometime-salvation of motherhood in Texas, Winik bravely chronicles the intimate experiences and decisions that shape us as adult.\"A born iconoclast, an aspiring artiste, a feminist vegetarian prodigal daughter, from early youth I considered myself destined to lead a startling life far outside the bounds of convention. I would be famous, dangerous, brilliant, and relentlessly cool: a sort of cross between Emma Goldman, Jack Kerouac, and Georgia O'Keeffe....So where did this station wagon come from?\"In pieces on subjects as diverse as sibling relationships, psychedelic drugs, parenthood, AIDS, and breastfeeding in public, with a case of characters ranging from hapless houseguests and bad-news beaux to gay friends, hero friends, and Friends You Love to Hate, Winik fuses the cadences of heart-to-heart talk with the concision of poetry. She takes us on a journey both personal and universal, a tour of the minefield of chance and circumstance that makes a life. There is great loss here - from a family pet to a parent to a baby. There are many pitfalls - from bulimia to drug addiction to the ordinary trauma of a stolen purse. Ultimately, though, there is a passion and energy for living, an unshaken belief that following one's heart is more important than following the rules, and a conviction that no dark secret is ever as dark as one thinks. Winik, in fact, is a connoisseur of her own foibles.\"The only thing that sticks with me is a kind of fitful, half-baked antimaterialism, an impatience with the tyranny of objects. Because of it, I just don't notice what kind of car other people drive, or the puddle I'm about to step into, or where I set down my bag when I got home. And this leaves the door wide open to the cold wind of chaos, which sweeps through my life at unpredictable intervals to exact its toll.\"This hip, funny, and moving collection marks the appearance of an appealing new voice in contemporary writing.",

Then, suddenly, she receives an invitation from First Lady Vanessa Merritt for an off-the-record conversation. Barrie's reporter's instincts are instantly aroused.During a furtive, emotionally charged meeting, Barrie sees that the President's beautiful wife is stunned by grief after the crib death of her infant son. Vanessa's motive for meeting Barrie seems to be to share her heartache with another woman. What Barrie overlooks in her excitement at hearing the confidences of the First Lady are the questions she should be asking: Why would Vanessa Merritt call her? And why would the President's wife hint to an unknown reporter that her child may have been murdered?Blind to everything but getting her exclusive, Barrie is determined to investigate the death of the President's child. But she soon realizes that getting her story will test her ethics and her patriotism. Would she expose information that could topple the presidency? She confronts this problem when she tracks down Gray Bondurant, a former presidential aide and war hero who shunned the politics of Washington in favor of life on a remote Wyoming ranch. And when they both begin to follow a trail of lies and intrigue right to the White House door, Barrie's exclusive puts at least three people on the firing line: the First Lady, Gray, and herself - as crimes and ambitions combine to endanger their lives and the future of the nation.",

A grove of birch trees whose trunks cast long, lean shadows in the grass, a swarm of golden leaves buzzing in the fall sunlight, an eddy of water cutting through a snowcovered bank are among the seventy-six color photographs in this quietly moving, spiritual book.",

Tsukiyama's graceful prose weaves the details of \"the silk work\" and Chinese village life into a story of courage and strength.",

        "Authors": "By Thompson, Dennis F.",
        "Description": "Are public officials morally justified in threatening violence, engaging in deception, or forcing citizens to act for their own good? Can individual officials be held morally accountable for the    wrongs that governments commit? Dennis Thompson addresses these questions by developing a conception of political ethics that respects the demands of both morality and politics. He criticizes conventional conceptions for failing to    appreciate the difference democracy makes, and for ascribing responsibility only to isolated leaders or to impersonal organizations. His book seeks to recapture the sense that men and women, acting for us and together with us in a    democratic process, make the moral choices that govern our public life.  Thompson surveys ethical conflicts of public officials over a range of political issues, including nuclear deterrence, foreign    intervention, undercover investigation, bureaucratic negligence, campaign finance, the privacy of officials, health care, welfare paternalism, drug and safety regulation, and social experimentation. He views these conflicts from the    perspectives of many different kinds of public officials - elected and appointed executives at several levels of government, administrators, judges, legislators, governmental advisers, and even doctors, lawyers, social workers, and    journalists whose professional roles often thrust them into public life.  In clarifying the ethical problems faced by officials, Thompson combines theoretical analysis with practical prescription, and    begins to define a field of inquiry for which many have said there is a need but to which few have yet contributed. Philosophers, political scientists, policy analysts, sociologists, lawyers, and other professionals interested in ethics    in government will gain insight from this book.",

        "Authors": "By Smith, Peter (EDT)",
        "Description": "In this beguiling anthology of more than 200 excerpts from the best commencement addresses given during the last twenty-five years, editor Peter J. Smith proves that, in the right hands, the graduation speech is thriving. Far from being a tired truism, the commencement address can be a thoughtful, heartfelt epistle, a dispatch from the front lines of adulthood to the fresh recruits of the newly graduated. In Onward! Twenty-Five Years of Advice, Exhortation, and Inspiration from America's Best Commencement Speeches, Smith has culled what the best minds (and hearts) have imparted to college graduates and in the process has created both a remarkable social history and a stirring celebration of the human spirit. Arranged by year (and introduced with a recap of each year's cultural trends and events), the excerpts in Onward! spring from people with a wide array of talent, experience, and perspective: presidents and novelists, actors and news anchors, scientists and comedians. Their wisdom -- much of it surprising, all of it compelling -- will inform, delight, and inspire.  \"We live in an age in which men have walked on the moon, have harnessed the vast power of nuclear energy, and have created enormous material wealth and riches. Yet our age is marked by ethical retardation, and by the passive tolerance of racism and poverty.\"-- VERNON JORDAN, 1976  \"I want to discourage you from choosing anything or making any decision simply because it is safe. Things of value seldom are.\" -- TONI MORRISON, 1979 \"The best thing you can give yourselves for graduation is the gift of possibility. And the best thing you can give each other is the pledge to go on protecting that gift in each other as long as you live.\"-- PAUL NEWMAN, 1990  \"Do not let people make you cynical. And do not think for a minute that you can have a good, full life if you don't care about what happens to the other people who share this nation and this planet with you.\"-- BILL CLINTON, 1995  \"In all things in life, choose your conscience, and trust your instincts and lead your lives without regrets. It is simply easier that way.\" -- DAVID HALBERSTAM, 1996   Full of equal measures of common sense and goodwill, Onward! is the ideal companion with which to begin one's journey",

        "Title": "Becoming Madame Mao",
        "Authors": "By Min, Anchee",
        "Description": "In a sweeping, erotically charged story that moves gracefully from the intimately personal to the great stage of world history, Anchee Min renders a powerful tale of passion, betrayal, and survival and creates a finely nuanced and always ambiguous portrait of one of the most fascinating, and vilified, women of the twentieth century.Madame Mao is almost universally known as the \"white-boned demon\" -- ambitious, vindictive, and cruel -- whose bid to succeed her husband led to the death of millions. But Min's story begins with a young girl named Yunhe, the unwanted daughter of a concubine who ignored her mother's pleas and refused to have her feet bound. It was the first act of rebellion for this headstrong, beautiful, and charismatic girl. She later fled the miseries of her family life, first to a provincial opera troupe, then to Shanghai and fame as an actress, and finally to the arid, mountainous regions of Yenan, where she fell in love with and married Mao Zedong. The great revolutionary leader proved to be an inattentive husband with a voracious appetite for infidelity, but the couple stayed together through the Communist victory, the disastrous Great Leap Forward, and the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.Min uses the facts of history and her lush, penetrating psychological imagination to take us beyond the myth of the person who so greatly influenced an entire generation of Chinese. The result is a complex portrait of a woman who railed against the confines of her culture, whose deep-seated insecurities propelled her to reinvent herself constantly, and whose ambition was matched only by her ferocious, never-to-be-fulfilled need to be loved. A daring narrative with all the compressed drama and high lyrical poetry of great opera, BECOMING MADAME MAO is the most ambitious and provocative work of Anchee Min's career.",

        "Title": "Judge Sewall's Apology: The Salem Witch Trials and the Forming of an American Conscience",
        "Authors": "By Francis, Richard",
        "Description": "The Salem witch hunt of 1692 has entered our vocabulary as the very essence of injustice. Biographer and novelist Richard Francis looks at the familiar drama with fresh eyes, grasping the true significance of this cataclysm through the personal story of Samuel Sewall, New England Puritan, Salem trial judge, antislavery agitator, defender of Native American rights, utopian theorist, campaigner against periwigs, family man, gallant wooer.Sewall's life encompassed the tensions that faced the second-generation colonists, caught between the staunch conservatism of the Puritans and the possibilities their new world offered. Everywhere there was conflict, schism, and violence; the new Americans were pitted against the Native Americans, whose pagan ways terrified them, and a hostile mother country intent on imposing her control over the colony. Out of the struggle to maintain unity emerged the forces that drove the Salem tragedy. For the first time, Francis reveals the nature and scale of the threat the authorities believed they were facing.Five guilt-wracked years after pronouncing judgment at the trials, Sewall walked into his church in Boston and recanted the guilty verdicts, praying for forgiveness. This extraordinary act not only proved a turning point for Sewall, it marked the moment when modern American values and attitudes came into being -- the shift from an almost medieval and allegorical view of good and evil to a respect for the mysteries of the human heart.Drawing on Sewall's copious diaries, Francis enables us to see the early colonists not as grim ideologues but as flesh and blood idealists, striving for a new society while coming to terms with the desires and imperfections of ordinary life. Through this unsung hero of conscience, we gain access to the first lost frontier of the New World.",
