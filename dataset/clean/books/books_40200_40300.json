        "Title": "The Transformation of War: The Most Radical Reinterpretation of Armed Conflict Since Clausewitz",
        "Authors": "By Van Creveld, Martin L.",
        "Description": "At a time when unprecedented change in international affairs is forcing governments, citizens, and armed forces everywhere to re-assess the question of whether military solutions to political problems are possible any longer, Martin van Creveld has written an audacious searching examination of the nature of war and of its radical transformation in our own time.For 200 years, military theory and strategy have been guided by the Clausewitzian assumption that war is rational\u2014a reflection of national interest and an extension of politics by other means. However, van Creveld argues, the overwhelming pattern of conflict in the post-1945 world no longer yields fully to rational analysis. In fact, strategic planning based on such calculations is, and will continue to be, unrelated to current realities. Small-scale military eruptions around the globe have demonstrated new forms of warfare with a different cast of characters - guerilla armies, terrorists, and bandits\u2014pursuing diverse goals by violent means with the most primitive to the most sophisticated weapons. Although these warriors and their tactics testify to the end of conventional war as we've known it, the public and the military in the developed world continue to contemplate organized violence as conflict between the super powers. At this moment, armed conflicts of the type van Creveld describes are occurring throughout the world. From Lebanon to Cambodia, from Sri Lanka and the Philippines to El Salvador, the Persian Gulf, and the strife-torn nations of Eastern Europe, violent confrontations confirm a new model of warfare in which tribal, ethnic, and religious factions do battle without high-tech weapons or state-supported armies and resources. This low-intensity conflict challenges existing distinctions between civilian and solder, individual crime and organized violence, terrorism and war. In the present global atmosphere, practices that for three centuries have been considered uncivilized, such as capturing civilians or even entire communities for ransom, have begun to reappear. Pursuing bold and provocative paths of inquiry, van Creveld posits the inadequacies of our most basic ideas as to who fights wars and why and broaches the inevitability of man's need to \u201cplay\u201d at war. In turn brilliant and infuriating, this challenge to our thinking and planning current and future military encounters is one of the most important books on war we are likely to read in our lifetime.",

She saw the man only twice in the past ten years, and he struck her as a cold, ruthless piece of work.  But as a silent partner in Pearl Cove, her late husband's pearl farm business, Donovan might be willing to help her...if the price is right.At twenty-nine, Hannah has been freed to live her life again.  Now she faces the mystery of her late husband's suspicious death, the prospect of bankruptcy...and the disappearance of the Black Trinity, a necklace containing a three million dollar fortune in black pearls that was to ber her financial security.Archer Donovan would rather roget he'd ever heard of Pearl Cove.  It links him to memories of living life on the dark side, the old lure, the heart-pumping, soul-numbing certainty that there was no law, no justice, no mercy;  just hunters and the hunted.  That life taught him to trust no one but family.  But when Hannah McGarry calls in an old debt and offers a million dollars, Archer is plunged back into the hell he vowed never to revisit;  into a deadly game of mony, power, cutthroat competition, and treachery in pursuit of a stolen fortune.  At his side is a woman he shouldn't want, yet cannot resist...a woman who may know more than she's telling about her husband's death...and more than is safe to know about that dark and elusive black pearls.  With a feeding frenzy of human sharks on their tails, Archer and Hannah race through unchanted waters in search of  the fabulous Black Trinity.  And the closer they come to finding the coveted pearls, the closer they come to danger and truth-and to each other",

        "Description": "Filled with soulful humor and quiet pathos, Abby Bardi's boldly drawn first novel marks the debut of a joyfully talented chronicler of the quest for connection in contemporary life.  Mary Fred Anderson, raised in an isolated fundamentalist sect whose primary obsessions seem to involve an imminent Apocalypse and the propagation of the name \"Fred,\" is hardly your average fifteen-year-old. She has never watched TV, been to a supermarket, or even read much of anything beyond the inscrutable dogma laid out by the prophet Fred. But this is all before Mary Fred's whole world tilts irrevocably on its axis: before her brothers, Fred and Freddie, take sick and pass on to the place the Reverend Thigpen calls \"the World Beyond\"; before Mama and Papa are escorted from the Fredian Outpost in police vans; and Mary Fred herself is uprooted and placed in foster care with the Cullison family. It is here, at Alice Cullison's suburban home outside Washington, D.C., where everything really changes -- for all parties involved. Mary Fred's new guardian, Alice, is a large-hearted librarian who, several years after her divorce, can't seem to shake her grief and loneliness. Meanwhile, Alice's daughter Heather, also known as Puffin, buries any hint of her own adolescent loneliness beneath an impenetrable armor of caustic sarcasm, studied apathy, and technicolor hair. And the enigmatic Uncle Roy is Alice's perennially jobless and intensely private brother. As Mary Fred struggles to adjust to the oddities of this alien world, from sordid daytime television and processed food to aromatherapy and transsexuality, she gradually begins to have an unmistakable influence on the lives of her housemates. But when a horrifying act of violence shakes the foundations of Mary Fred's fragile new family, she finds herself forced to confront, painfully, the very nature of the way she was raised. With a knack for laying bare the absurdities of daily life, Abby Bardi captures, with grace and authority, all the ambivalence and emotional uncertainty at the heart of these quirky characters' awakenings.",

        "Description": "Like a newly discovered treasure map offering a path to buried riches, Foxes in the Henhouse is a hard-hitting political blueprint for how the Democrats can win again in the South and rural America. The authors document the Republicans' rise in the South and Midwest, expose the hypocrisy that marked their ascent, and offer a take-no-prisoners plan to kick them out.The authors know of what they speak. \"Rural strategists\" Steve Jarding and Dave \"Mudcat\" Saunders are famous for securing Democratic victories in places they shouldn't have -- most notably in Mark Warner's successful run for governor of Virginia, a campaign that wasn't afraid to use bluegrass concerts and NASCAR to get the message out.When George W. Bush swept the South clean in 2004, it was the final insult to Jarding and Saunders, two self-proclaimed \"bubbas\" on a mission to convince their fellow southerners and rural Americans that the GOP's claim of representing \"values,\" patriotism, the sportsmen, and fiscal conservatism is a disastrous farce. In addition to exposing the lies behind the gradual Republican invasion of the hinterland that began in the 1960s, they offer some surprisingly simple strategies for Democrats to capture each of these issues. Among other things, Jarding and Saunders urge Democrats to? Quit turning their noses up at the culture of rural America and talk to people where they live? Learn how to count when going after votes? Show some passion and retaliate when Republicans assassinate their charactersPacked with meticulous and shocking research findings; blunt, laugh-out-loud language; and merciless assaults on George W. Bush, Tom DeLay, Bill O'Reilly, and plenty of other right-wing charlatans, Foxes in the Henhouse is a must-read and will be one of the most talked-about books of the year and for election cycles to come.",

Still, Ria never imagines that she'll leave a Christmas party with him, or that, caught up in the magic of a snowfall and a bottle of champagne, she'll give in to desire. But the next morning she faces the stunning truth: she's slept with a man she barely knows. And that's not the only surprise in store: eight weeks later, Ria knows she's carrying Taylor Mackensie's child.Desperate to spare her baby the pain and stigma of illegitimacy, Ria makes the only decision she can. Somehow she must persuade Taylor MacKensie to agree to a temporary marriage. Yet how do you propose marriage to a relative stranger? How do you tell him you're carrying his child? And how do you react when he meets your news with anger and disbelief?Within hours, Taylor's outrage cools and he insists that they marry immediately. Suddenly Ria is sharing his house, his name, and something infinitely more dangerous to her heart...a tenderness she never expected, a passion she can't seem to control. But afraid that Taylor's motives have no more to do with protecting his career - and his baby - than with his feelings for her, Ria will try her best to keep her distance...until the day tragedy strikes and teaches them both a lesson in miracles - and love.",

        "Description": "While the terms 'power' and 'rights' are increasingly incorporated into the language of development agencies they have yet to fully permeate the practice of poverty reduction. Acknowledging that this partly results from a lack of clarity over the concepts of power and rights and partly from questions of how to operationalize these ideas, the World Bank and the UK Department for International Development co-sponsored a series of short papers for focusing on enhancing understanding of the relationships between power, rights, and poverty reductions.Following discussion during a two day working meeting, this publication brings together the edited papers, along with a selection of supplementary materials. A first series of papers addresses competing definitions and conceptual issues around power and rights, illustrating these with experiences observing and applying the concepts in practice in different countries. Following this, papers address topics aimed at helping development practitioners to apply these concepts to their work. Part II contains the supplemental materials, including a summary of the major theoretical conceptualizations of power, and an overview of the literature on power and rights. Prepared by leading thinkers on the topics of power and rights these materials offer both development professionals and students of development studies succinct summaries of the relationship between theory and practice.",

Familiar Shakespearean themes and devices \u2014 romance, jealousy, disguises, and mistaken identities \u2014 enrich the plot, along with a sparkling cast of supporting characters, including rival wooers, informers, and witty go-betweens.This madcap romp has been a favorite of readers and playgoers for over 400 years.

Tragedy unexpectedly strikes when Gracie's older brother, star of the high school varsity team and her closest confidant, is killed in a drunk-driving accident. Wracked with grief over her family's loss, Gracie decides to fill the void left on her brother's team by petitioning the local school board to allow her to play in the boys' soccer league.At first, no one can understand what Gracie is up to, not her mom (Elisabeth Shue), her former soccer star dad (Dermot Mulroney), the team or school officials. Everyone warns Gracie that pursuing her dream is a waste of time\u2014that soccer is a sport for boys and boys only. Undeterred, Gracie finds reserves of strength she never knew existed, and persists in changing everyone's beliefs in what she is capable of, including her own.Based on true events in the lives of the Shue family (producer and co-star Andrew Shue, Academy Award\u00ae-nominated actress Elisabeth Shue and their family), Gracie is an exciting and emotional sports story that marks the dramatic feature debut of Academy Award\u00ae-winning director Davis Guggenheim (An Inconvenient Truth). This young adult novel includes an eight-page color photo section and a Q&A with Andrew Shue and Elisabeth Shue about the real-life story behind the film. 8-page color photo insert.",
