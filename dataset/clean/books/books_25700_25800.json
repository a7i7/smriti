        "Description": "In business, it has always hurt to \"wait and see.\" In the vast world of Internet commerce, it's vital to establish a strong, quality presence -- now, say Arthur Andersen Web experts Jonathan Rosenoer, Douglas Armstrong, and J. Russell Gates -- before another site starts filling your customer's needs with a click of a mouse. With the number of potential customers who are connected well on its way to 1 billion, the Internet is at once the greatest opportunity and the greatest threat to established businesses. It's not enough for a company to be on the Web; the company must be consistently more effective, more accessible, and more exciting than any other site in its category.  Rosenoer, Armstrong, and Gates provide a strategic view of case studies of 25 well-known companies engaged in e-commerce. Their studies reveal how any company can capture meaningful Internet advantage for its stakeholders -- whether they are customers, shareholders, or business partners. The authors describe how the achievements of such champions as Coldwell Banker, Federal Express, Bloomberg Financial Markets, Dell Computer, Northwest Airlines, 1-800-FLOWERS, Charles Schwab & Company, and Wells Fargo, as well as Internet-based companies like GeoCities, SeniorNet, and Women.com, can be successfully put to work for any company. They isolate the eight value propositions a company must offer through its site; knowledge, choice, convenience, customization, savings, community, entertainment, and trust; and they illustrate, with multiple case studies for each, how these are achieved. This guided tour to maximizing the Internet advantage walks the reader through the steps needed to crystallize a company's missions, goals, and assets; to identify customers and their needs; and to keep ahead of competition through discerning emerging Internet business standards, online positioning, and foreseeing impending competition from new technologies. A final chapter sets forth the skills managers require to conquer the",

        "Authors": "By Schwartz, Peter, Leyden, Peter, and Hyatt, Joel",
        "Description": "As we stand at the threshold of the new millennium, the future seems both exhilarating and terrifying. Does it hold great promise of freedom and opportunity or the threat of conflict and inequality? In the tradition of such influential and defining books as Future Shock and Megatrends, Peter Schwartz, Peter Leyden, and Joel Hyatt argue in The Long Boom that we are, in fact, on the verge of a global economic expansion on a scale never before experienced\u2014and that the choices we make as informed individuals, institutions, communities, and nations today will determine whether that vision is realized. Analyzing economic, political, technological and socio-cultural trends that began to converge in the early 1980s, the authors offer a compelling\u2014and highly plausible\u2014vision of how the next twenty years will unfold. By 2020, we can expect to experience tremendous advances in now-emerging technologies; widespread adoption of alternative energy sources; increased productivity; and, perhaps most important, the creation of a truly global economy. Going beyond a description of this scenario, the authors identify potential bumps in the road and urge educators, policy makers, business leaders, social activists, and individuals in all types of organizations to participate in the \u201cpolitics of the long boom,\u201d the realm where people come together to pool resources and solve common problems. Grand in scope but intensely personal in scale, The Long Boom shows us all how to take an active role in creating a vibrant, diverse, constantly learning, and sustainable global society.",

From the first Miss America Pageant protest in 1968 to the \"divorce\" from the New Left, from the first fights for abortion rights to the burgeoning of a global feminist consciousness and actions, Robin Morgan raised, embraced, and recorded issues from housewives' rage to racism, through women's love for women to global peace, neocolonialism, and the environment. Here is her voice in its full range: alternately journalistic, humorous, intensely personal, meditative, theoretical, and analytical, but always impassioned - with an obsession for human freedom and for the power of language.",

Little has been offered to teachers who are not fully satisfied with their present reading-writing programs but who lack the confidence to make a change. In this book Regie Routman attempts to provide support, encouragement, and ideas to teachers looking for alternatives.  Drawing from her own experience, she describes an existing program that has worked well for students and teachers and offers suggestions of how any elementary classroom can benefit from the transition from standardized texts to literature. The material she presents is designed to demonstrate the alternatives available, to stimulate thinking, and to give teachers, parents, and administrators the knowledge and procedures that are necessary to make a change.",

        "Description": "Men are beasts, authorities throughout the ages have agreed. Here, scolars of male behavior from St. Catherine of Siena (\"Let not thy misfortune be such as to enter into any private conversation, with monk or layman.\") to Zsa Zsa Gabor (\"A man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is finished.\"), from Mae West (\"Give a man a free hand and he'll run it all over you\"), to Andrea Dworkin (\"Intercourse is the pure, sterile, formal expression of men's contempt for woman\") offer suggestions on what to do about, with, and without men. In this magnificent compendium of wise and unwise words and warnings from \"the fair sex\" about the opposite sex, Tama Starr offers a tantalizing companion to her collection of infuriating comments by men about women, The \"Natural Inferiority\" of Women (1991). Eve's Revenge is both a valuable source of ammunition in the ongoing battle between the sexes and a keenly hilarious parody of those who long for the day when, the battle won, \"men\" (a socially constructed phenomenon anyway) will be fully under the control of the wiser, more compassionate, more virtuous-that is, feminine-beings destined to succeed them on the ladder of evolution.",

        "Authors": "By Handlin, Oscar",
        "Description": "One of the most eminent historians of our time offers here a perceptive guide to the study of history. Truth in History teaches how to read, how to analyze, how to discriminate. It is as helpful to the reader whose history is created daily in the news as it is to the professional historian whose field is in a crisis of disarray.A Pulitzer Prize winner and mentor for more than a generation of American historians, Oscar Handlin instructs his readers in the fundamentals of his field. He tells us how to deal with evidence, how to discern patterns amid flux, how to situate ourselves in history, and how to recognize where fact shades subtly into opinion. He combines a historian's knowledge with a historiographer's breadth and a philosopher's temperament. He is concerned with a historian's limitations and with the ways one can operate honestly withinthose limitations. He brings a full appreciation of the past to his evaluation of what is modern. And while carefully examining recent developments in his discipline, he culls genuine achievements from the trends that confuse originality with true worth.Handlin everywhere enlivens his discussion with brilliant details. As he pursues broad definitions of history and its uses, he also attends to specific subjects, showing how they bear directly on each other and on his concerns. He deals with Populism, capitalism, laissez faire, the two-party system, the New History, ethnicity, and roots, treating all with the flair of an accomplished man of letters. Only a scholar of Handlin's experience and expertise could have brought such a wealth of particular facts to an issue of such general importance--truth in history.",

        "Authors": "By Petit, Chris",
        "Description": "It is 1985: Detective Chief Inspector Cross of Belfast's Royal Ulster Constabulary is wondering, again, if he should leave the force. He's been there for twelve years, but he's a more adept loner than he is a careerist. He's British and Catholic, neither of which earns him the trust of his Irish-Protestant colleagues, or the civilian contacts essential to his job. And how effective can any officer of the law be in a country grown inured to the facts and effects of decades of violent hostilities? Still, Cross is unfailingly compelled by murder - the violence almost dazzling in its stark contrast to the \"bloodlessness of his own existence,\" the who and why behind a crime an undeniable driving force in him. Especially at this moment: in a city \"where a death was easier to arrange than crossing the road,\" DCI Cross has spotted the gruesome handiwork of a serial killer.It might be that Cross has simply stumbled on someone else who's made sectarian violence a vocation, but this killer is cutting across political and religious lines - and with a viciousness reminiscent of a particularly grisly episode in the recent, tortuous history of the city. Cross has to fight his superiors to be allowed to focus attention where he thinks it's necessary, and even when they agree, they handicap him (or so they think) by assigning a young policewoman to the case. But WPC Westerby is a recent transfer from the sex abuse unit, so there isn't much she hasn't seen; and her keenness, intelligence and ambition make her quickly indispensable to Cross. Because as they close in on the killer, he seems to retreat further and further behind a layered identity and motive. As they uncover more and more about him, they uncover, as well, more and more of the maze of secret, paranoid alliances, backroom deals and sanctioned treachery hidden just below the surface of the conflict. And even as the situation is growing increasingly clear to them, they are being drawn, perhaps inextricably, into a nightmare world where political and sexual terror form part of the same deadly trap, and where fighting is profitable, people expendable and knowledge of the truth a grave liability.",

        "Authors": "By Russell, Lincoln, Russell, Lincoln (ILT), Russell, Lincoln (EDT), and Smedvig, Caroline (EDT)",
        "Description": "Seiji Ozawa's twenty-fifth anniversary with the Boston Symphony Orchestra this year makes him the longest-tenured music director in the distinguished orchestra's history. This collection of striking photographs and personal tributes celebrates the charisma and career of this remarkable musician by capturing Ozawa at work, at play, and in private. The photographer Lincoln Russell has spent twenty years photographing Ozawa and was allowed unusual, behind-the-scenes access to the conductor. His photographs feature many of the artists who have appeared with Ozawa, from Mstislav Rostropovich to Jessye Norman, but they perhaps best capture the man himself, an Ozawa that, until now, only BSO insiders have known -- quirky, complicated, and most of all joyful. Intermixed with these candid images are personal tributes from Ozawa's notable colleagues and friends, a group whose diversity indicates the true scope of his influence: Steven Spielberg, Yo-Yo Ma, James Taylor, Andre` Previn, and John Williams, among others. Born in Shenyang, China, in 1935, Seiji Ozawa began his association with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the Tanglewood Music Center in 1960. He was appointed music director in 1973 at the age of thirty-eight. Under his leadership, the BSO has strengthened its international reputation and its commitment to new music. Maestro Ozawa has appeared regularly with the world's greatest orchestras -- most memorably, he led separate choruses on five continents simultaneously in Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" at the opening ceremonies of the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan.",

But such has been the pace of progress, especially in the past couple of decades, that the story has been fragmented, with no single, user-friendly guide to present the broad sweep as well as the detailed discoveries.Companion to the Cosmos tells the whole story of the Universe and the people who made the discoveries.The Companion begins with an extended introduction in which Gribbin sets out the present state of knowledge and explains the key discoveries of twentieth century cosmology: the Universe is evolving and growing. The main section of the book, an A-Z encyclopedia, is a mixture of lengthy feature articles on major subjects (for example, black holes, gravity, our Galaxy, life in the Universe, supernovae), shorter entries, and biographies of the scientists. In the final section, \"Timelines,\" cosmological discoveries are set out alongside key dates in general history and the history of science, from the time of the ancient astronomers of Greece up to the present day.",

Twenty years later, Packwood found himself embroiled in his own career-shattering scandal, complete with possible Senate hearings, furious calls for his resignation, subpoenaed diaries, and two muckraking Washington Post journalists.Accused of making sexual advances toward more than twenty female employees during his long career, Senator Packwood has become a universal symbol of sexual misconduct, the multifaceted, hotly debated issue that has been making headlines since the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings. Packwood chronicles the life and career of an enigmatic man who is both a brilliant strategist and an on-the-ropes politician. After more than two hundred interviews with insiders, veteran reporter Mark Kirchmeier reveals the fascinating - and disturbing - stories behind the accusations.The Packwood saga goes beyond the story of one politician's rise and fall. Kirchmeier's keen analysis reveals a personal scandal that has left its imprint on the public issue of sexual harassment and will affect future government ethics legislation.",

In 1770, the British Parliament saw the area as a solution to England's overcrowded prisons. On arriving at the harbor, the first \"convicts\" found themselves in one of the hottest climates in the world, and were greeted by aboriginal natives whose curiosity was matched only by their desire for the newcomers to leave. Sydney is a place where gravestones have such inscriptions as \"Be ready mates, that's all!,\" where people wear shorts and sandals to one of the most renowned opera houses in the world, where the working man fights for what he's got and never backs down. Geoffrey Moorhouse brilliantly describes the city, its appetites, and its character-from its colonial beginnings to its becoming the host city of the 2000 Olympics. His curious knowledge, remarkable insight, and marvelous storytelling capture Sydney's warmth, texture, resilience, and loyalty.",

Now, Sam's clean and sober, older and wise enough to keep her distance in love. But this time, she's headed west on a mission right out of the Twilight Zone: Sam's received an urgent message from her mother - her dead mother.My dearest Sugar. I must see you. It's urgent. I need your help. The mind-blowing letter was postmarked Santa Fe, penned in her mother's handwriting, and disclosed details only Johanna Adams could know. It could have been an entry from Sam's latest book of bizarre anecdotes, American Weird - or an elaborate hoax. Either way, it instantly rekindled Sam's impossible wish that her mother hadn't really died in a plane crash thirty-four years earlier. With her journalistic instincts - and a daughter's need for closure - at full tilt, Sam packs up her Shih Tzu and touches down among Santa Fe's tourists and crystal gazers, jewelry shops and fastfood stands. But only when she summons the courage to knock on the door of Room 409 at the La Fonda Hotel does her mother-seeking adventure take off with no turning back....",

As women's roles expand, it becomes evident that the goals of women are harmonious with the interests of children, and seldom in conflict with those of men. The loosening of traditional family roles and the emerging diversity in family forms provide flexibility not only for women, but for all family members.  Family policy and practice must take into account these changes and challenges brought about by the new families.  FEMINISM, CHILDREN, AND THE NEW FAMILIES paves the way.",

The Parrot's Lament, his acclaimed previous book, featured extraordinary true stories of animal consciousness and intelligence. Linden's latest book goes beyond our everyday encounters with animals at home and in the zoo in a wide-ranging collection of real-life anecdotes that offer further compelling evidence of their higher mental capabilities and their awareness of the needs and feelings of others.  The Octopus and the Orangutan reveals extraordinary new details about animals introduced in The Parrot's Lament, and then finds intelligent behavior in surprising new places, ranging from the octopus's garden to the crow's nest. Amazing feats of stealth, deception, and larceny accompany unexpected acts of kindness and friendship. Animals show they are cagey bargainers and tough negotiators both with their human keepers and with one another. The animals themselves are our guides in this fresh look at the question of animal intelligence.  From the beloved pets we think we know to the remarkable survival skills of creatures in the wild, Eugene Linden once again shares his wonder and joy at the infinite variety of animal behavior that continues to inform, amaze, and touch us all.",

        "Description": "Jacques Gansler takes a hard look at the need to convert the industry from an inefficient and noncompetitive part of the U.S. economy to an integrated, civilian/military operation.Author of two widely-read books on the defense industry, Jacques Gansler takes a hard look at the need to convert the industry from an inefficient and noncompetitive part of the U.S. economy to an integrated, civilian/military operation. He defines the challenges, especially the influence of old-line defense interests, and presents examples of restructuring. Gansler discusses growing foreign involvement, lessons of prior industrial conversions, the best structure for the next century, current barriers to integration, a three-part transformation strategy, the role of technological leadership, and the critical workforce. He concludes by outlining sixteen specific actions for achieving civil/military integration.In Gansler's view, the end of the Cold War with the former Soviet Union represents a permanent downturn rather than a cyclical decline in the defense budget. He argues that this critical transition period requires a restructuring of the defense acquisitions process to achieve a balance between economic concerns and national security, while maintaining a force size and equipment modernization capable of deterring future conflicts.Gansler argues that for the defense industry to survive and thrive, the government must make its acquisitions process more flexible, specifically by lowering barriers to integration. This includes, among other things, rethinking the production specifications for new equipment and changing bids for contracts from a cost basis to a price basis.Gansler point out that by making primarily political and procedural changes (rather than legislative ones), companies will be able to produce technology for both civilian and military markets, instead of exclusively for one or the other as has been the norm. This dual-use approach would save the government billions of dollars annually and would enable the military to diversify by utilizing state-of-the-art.",
