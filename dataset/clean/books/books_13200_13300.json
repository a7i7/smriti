        "Description": "From one of America's most esteemed men of letters comes a new and vivid recounting of life in the American South. Not since Reynolds Price's award-winning, bestselling novel Kate Vaiden has he told a woman's story in her own voice. Roxanna Slade is this woman.  Roxanna begins her story on her twentieth birthday -- a day that introduces her to the harsh realities of adulthood and changes the course of her life forever. From this day on, Roxanna is quick to share with the reader the intimate details of ninety years of life in North Carolina. While she rarely leaves the small town of her youth, Roxanna's vision of the world is shaped by intense passions and loyalties and the certain tragedies of a life long lived.  Roxanna Slade is a sweet-and-keen-tongued tale-teller. And her beguiling tale is one that boldly reflects the high and low moments in the development of the modern South and the nation as well as the inner strength of a woman possessed of a piercingly clear vision, forthright hungers and immense vitality.",

These angels hold the ability to render people within close proximity reasonable, calm, and virtually incapable of lying. The Empyrean has harnessed their power, distributing them to all members of their government, in an attempt to promulgate peace among their people.But the leaders of the Earth-based Empire, the Pax, view the angels as an extreme danger to mankind. Amid rumors that the angels are the linchpin of an alien plot to subvert humanity, the Pax dispatch an innocent academic, Jereko Kostas, on a reconnaissance mission to uncover the truth about the angels. Jereko, along with Chandris, a young woman who has spent her life as a petty thief and a grifter, signs on with an \"angel-hunting\" ship to investigate. When they uncover disturbing facts about the angels and their source, Angelmass, tension between the Empyrean and the Pax builds, and their discoveries set the stage for a major confrontation between the Pax and the stubbornly independent inhabitants of the Empyrean.",

Here, in the Turkish half of the island, the ever-enterprising Leggy Starlitz has alighted, pausing on his mission to storm the Third World with the \"G-7\" girls, the cheapest, phoniest all-girl band ever to wear Wonderbras and spandex. And his market is staring him in the face: millions of teenagers trapped in a world of mullahs and mosques, all ready to blow their pocket change on G-7's massive merchandising campaign - and to wildly anticipate music the group will never release.Leggy's brilliant plan means doing business with some of the world's most dangerous people. His business partner is the rich and connected Mehmet Ozbey, a man with many identities and a Turkish girlfriend whose beauty and singing voice could blow G-7 right out of the water. His security chief is Pulat Romanevich Khoklov, who learned to fly MiG combat jets in Afghanistan and now pilots Milosevic's personal airplane. Among these thieves, schemers, and killers, Leggy must act quickly and decisively. Bombs are dropping in Yugoslavia. Y2K is just around the corner. And the only rule to live by is that the whole scheme stops before the year 2000.But Leggy gets a surprise when the daughter he's never met arrives on his doorstep. A major fan of G-7, she is looking for a father - and her search forces Leggy to examine his life before making a madcap journey in search of a father of his own. It's a detour that puts his G-7 Zeitgeist in some real jeopardy. For in Istanbul, Leggy's former partners are getting restless, and the G-7 girls are beginning to die.",

Then comes the call to the Gulf and the weeks of tedious waiting in the cold, barren Saudi desert (\"Wall-to-Wall Fuck All\" they name it), weeks that culminate at last in the exhilarating, terrifying dash across the sands into the teeth of battle, moments that change the men forever, especially those who witness the unspeakable spectacle of two thousand Iraqi soldiers buried alive by U.S. earthmovers.Here, too, is the story of First Sergeant Dee Crane, member of a vanishing breed, caught between the uncompromising traditions of Fort Riley's legendary history, from Custer to Patton, and the changing needs of a society that too often derides and discards the soldiers who protect it. And here is the face of modern war itself - its mask of high-tech marvels disguising the bedrock reality of grunts who must take and hold ground as they always have: with blood and bravery.Through it all Stroud weaves the distinguished fighting history of the Big Red One, christened in the fiery crucible of the First World War, tempered by its massive defeat at the Kasserine Pass in the Second World War, battered in the grinding carnage of Vietnam, and resurrected with the strategies of Air Land Battle that proved so devastatingly effective in Desert Storm.",

From this research they show how one can begin to realize one's highest powers of creativity and effectiveness.The stages of learning that every aspiring magician must undergo: hearing the call to magic - discovering the need for it in one's life; initiating - or how to think freshly about a problem; testing oneself and one's strength in the face of mighty challenges; drawing a success out of failure; and sharing one's powers as ancient magicians did in the practice known as \"casting circle.\"This is a handbook on how to work magic in your life. From rituals to actual magical practices adapted for use in the workplace, Magic at Work instructs and inspires.",

The issue of deregulation is of critical importance because the spirit of entrepreneurship that is behind deregulation is seldom examined from a sociological perspective. This book places the debate concerning the future of public education in a meaningful framework that allows the reader to ask new questions and seek genuine solutions. Using the latest research as the basis for discussion, this book provides a fresh look at the growing and politically volatile charter school movement. The authors present the most balanced analysis to date of the movement that is changing the landscape of American education.",

        "Description": "Unmarried at 40 - could there be anything worse? Our culture dictates that this woman is on her way down, a shrew or a lonely old maid, unattractive to men, a failure at catching or holding the golden ring of marriage. Yet, when psychologists Carol Anderson and Susan Stewart interviewed single women throughout the country - never married, divorced, with or without children - they discovered something different. Having confronted the old myths, these women are making choices, enjoying their own power, thriving on solitude and friendships. Their stories offer blueprints for living, as well as inspiration, for other women \"flying solo.\"Most of these women did not intend to be on their own at midlife. They had accepted the \"marriage and motherhood mandate\" as their destiny - until Prince Charming failed to appear or the sacrifices of marriage turned out to be too great. While giving up the dream has not been easy, at midlife they have not only reached some resolution but are also busily creating purpose in their own lives. The authors share these women's stories and their practical advice on managing the mechanics of being single, transforming loneliness, redefining the importance of work, developing friendship and support networks, living with and without intimacy and sex with men, and choosing to have and raise children. In the process they define not just a new American lifestyle but a new American Dream.",

        "Description": "\"The urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy....To renew America, we must be bold...must revitalize our democracy....Together with our friends and allies, we will work to shape change, lest it engulf us.\" With those inaugural words, William Jefferson Clinton began his first term as President of the United States. Now, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and a former White House aide provide the first penetrating, thoughtful evaluation of President Clinton's leadership.  Before he was voted into office, Bill Clinton told the authors in an interview that he wanted to be a transforming leader, a president who would fashion real and lasting change in peoples' lives, in the tradition of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. But how has this president, who has sought to lead from the center with his vice president, Al Gore, and the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, measured up against his own stated goals and the aspirations and performances of other presidents since World War II? From the health care debacle and the 1994 midterm elections that swept the Republicans to a majority in both houses of Congress to the effect of scandal and impeachment on his ability to govern, Dead Center examines the leadership style of Bill Clinton and offers a forceful challenge to the strategy of centrism.  There is no more respected presidential historian than James MacGregor Burns, author of several acclaimed books on leadership and the Pulitzer Prize-winning study of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Georgia J. Sorenson adds her own insights as a political scientist and presidential scholar. Their combined efforts have resulted in an incisive, informative, authoritative work and an absorbing read.",

        "Title": "The Wisdom of the Bones: In Search of Human Origins",
        "Authors": "By Shipman, Pat and Walker, Alan",
        "Description": "A remarkable discovery was made a decade ago on a dig in northern Kenya. When all the bone and skull fragments were painstakingly pieced together, they revealed the nearly complete skeleton of a teenage male (nicknamed Nariokotome boy, after a nearby sand river). Faced with the best-ever specimen of Homo erectus - a species long identified as the proverbial missing link between apes and humans - paleoanthropologist Alan Walker embarked on a long-term investigation of that species's nature. In this book, telling the story of that inquiry, he introduces us to his ever surprising, deeply engrossing world.Walker examines even the tiniest of bones and the subtlest of clues in his analysis. He first recounts the story of the more-than-century-long search for the \"missing link,\" a bizarre and compelling saga made up of brilliant science and speculative nonsense. Then he builds, step-by-step, on some of his predecessors' assumptions, and he challenges others, using state-of-the-art techniques to reveal the truth.In Walker's hands the bones reveal an amazing amount of information about the Nariokotome boy's anatomy and the way he lived. We watch as Walker deduces from the evidence that community and cooperation were already very important at this stage of human evolution; that the boy was modern in climatic adaptation and locomotion yet archaic in growth pattern; and that the boy could not speak. In Walker's final assessment this last insight becomes the most important one.",

Yet what Liliane does not know of herself, that which is buried, the underneath, the riches of the unconscious, become present during the years and hours of Liliane's classic analysis.By brilliantly interweaving the voices of Liliane and her analyst with monologues from the friends and lovers who have formed the geography of her experience, the actualities and eccentricities of Liliane's past come to use through her, and what were pieces of a young girl's life become the landscape of her future.",

When a drink-fueled accident takes not only his life but that of the mother who tried so hard to shield her sons, the boys sell off what little remains of their daddy's tenant farm and leave Oklahoma. It is 1957, and work is still to be had in the logging camps of northern Idaho. But just outside Snake Junction, they stop at a roadhouse; and there, Lee's country-and-western talents get him a job. The two settle in, Lee to his music-and women and drink-and seventeen-year-old Buddy to roaming the landscape, at loose ends until a woman nearly twice his age turns up. Irene Sullivan is a smoky beauty, and Lee makes a play for her. But it is Buddy she wants.  By turns darkly violent and heartbreakingly tender, Finding Caruso is a work of extraordinary emotional power from an astonishingly original writer.",

Because as this sparkling, love-and-laugher-filled book reveals, we serve an outrageously joyful God. Dipping their pens in infectious good humor, authors and Women of Faith conference speakers Patsy Clairmont, Barbara Johnson, Marilyn Meberg, Luci Swindoll, Sheila Walsh, and Thelma Wells offer irresistible reasons for rejoicing in every circumstance of life. Using the metaphor of a circus, they encourage us to revel in the three rings of God's love. They join us in skipping across the high wire of his grace, falling back on his safety net of peace, celebrating his hope, and laughing aloud in the freedom that lets us live our lives with abandon. Outrageous Joy introduces one attraction after another--but there's never any competition among the acts! Because each chapter has its own important truth to reveal about joyous Christian living, as seen in: -The Ballyhoo at Bethlehem - Step Right Up! - Juggling, Spinning, and Smiling All the While - Flying Through the Air with the Greatest of Ease - Swallowing Swords - The Biggest Big Top . . . and other wise, merry-hearted reflections. Filled with whimsical illustrations and Barbara Johnson's 'sideshow' nuggets of wisdom and humor, Outrageous Joy will help women of all ages embrace God's outrageous plan for their lives.",

        "Description": "Albert Einstein was an exceptional human being. Perhaps nothing reflects the breadth and scope of his brilliance, his interests, and his influence better than his publications -- more than six hundred scientific papers, books, essays, reviews, and opinion pieces. Einstein began publishing in March 1901 with a scientific work that appeared in the German journal Annalen der Physik when he was twenty-two; the last publication was an editorial in the journal Common Cause which appeared a few months before his death in 1955. In the fifty-four-year interval, his published work ranged widely over relativity theory and quantum physics, nationalism, Judaism, war, peace, and education. Indeed, Einstein's literary output was so abundant that even many of his most informed admirers are not familiar with all of it.The Einstein Almanac takes a look at Einstein's year-by-year output, explaining his three-hundred most important publications and setting them into the context of his life, science, and world history. Concentrating primarily on Einstein's scientific and humanitarian writings, Alice Calaprice summarizes most of the papers and describes meaningful events surrounding their publication, including Einstein's personal life, his travels, the work of other scientists, social and cultural developments at the time, and national and international events. Enjoyable and informative, The Einstein Almanac provides a unique perspective on Einstein's genius -- and his humanity.",

        "Description": "The past ten years have been good to investors. The combination of safe bluechip stocks and more volatile growth stocks has doubled the money of well-positioned investors in five years or less. Yet some experts say that the stock boom is nearly over, that the fabulous profits of the 1980s were a fluke caused by a one-time decline in inflation and interest rates. Michael Sivy couldn't disagree more: He sees another stock market boom ahead and tells you how small investors can do as well as the pros in the coming decade.

        "Description": "Pauline Melville conjures up vivid pictures both of savanna and forest and of city life in South America where love is often trumped by disaster.  Unforgettable characters illuminate theme and plot: Sonny, the strange, beautiful and isolate son of Beatrice and Danny, the brother and sister who have a passionate affair at the time of the solar eclipse in 1919; Father Napier, the sandy-haired evangelist whom the Indians perceive as a giant grasshopper; Chofy McKinnon the modern Indian, torn between savanna life and urban future.  This is a novel that embraces nearly a century, large in scope but intimate as a whisper, where laughter is never far from the scene of tragedy; a parable of miscegenation and racial elusiveness, of nature defying culture, magic confronting rationalism and of the eternally rebellious nature of love.",

        "Description": "In Anger Kills, Dr. Redford Williams reveals ground-breaking research that confirms that hostility not only is a serious barrier to happiness, but can lead to heart disease and other life-threatening illnesses. Dr. Williams and his wife, Virginia, team up to present the latest  research in the field and offer seventeen practical strategies that can help readers translate scientific theory into meaningful action. Begin by taking the Hostility Questionnaire, which will help you assess the degree to which hostility, cynicism, and aggression rule your life. Then start a Hostility Log and follow the Hostility Roadmap to keep track of those incidents or people that really push your buttons. With these insights, you can then move on to sample any or all of the seventeen different strategies to reduce the wrath that sabotages your health and can drain your life of joy and pleasure. In writing Anger Kills, the authors draw not only on the latest research, but on their own experiences as a couple for more than twenty-nine years and on the experiences of couples who have used the Williamses' methods successfully in various workshops the authors have led. The result is a combination of solid science with empathic explorations of the nature of human relationships and caring. This is science with a heart.",
