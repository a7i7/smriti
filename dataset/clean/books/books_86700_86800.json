        "Authors": "By Viorst, Judith and Gibson, Laura (ILT)",
        "Description": "Judith Viorst returns with more poems in her \u201cDecades\u201d poetry series detailing the highs and lows of being an octogenarian. Continuing the comedic insight from I\u2019m Too Young to be Seventy, these verses of memories and advice from eighty years of love, marriage, and grandchildren are sure to bring laughs.What does it mean to be eighty? In her wise and playful poems, Judith Viorst discusses love, friendship, grand parenthood, and all the particular marvels\u2014and otherwise\u2014of this extraordinary decade. She describes the wonder of seeing the world with new eyes\u2014not because of revelation but because of a successful cataract operation. She promises not to gently fade away, and not to drive after daylight\u2019s faded away either. She explains how she\u2019s gotten to be a \u201cthree-desserts\u201d grandmother (\u201cJust don\u2019t tell your mom!\u201d), shares how memory failure can keep you married, and enumerates her hopes for the afterlife (which she doesn\u2019t believe in, but if it does exist, her sister-in-law better not be there with her).  As Viorst gleefully attests, eighty is not too old to dream, to flirt, to drink, and to dance. It\u2019s also not too late to give up being cheap or to take up with a younger man of seventy-eight. Zesty, hopeful, and full of the pleasures of living, Viorst\u2019s poems speak to her legions of readers, who recognize themselves in her knowing observations, in her touching reflections, and in her joyful affirmations. Funny, moving, inspirational, and true\u2014the newest in Judith Viorst\u2019s beloved \u201cdecades\u201d series extols the virtues, victories, frustrations, and joys of life.",

        "Description": "From a living legend\u2014James D. Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize for having revealed the structure of DNA\u2014a personal account of the making of a scientist. In Avoid Boring People, the man who discovered \u201cthe secret of life\u201d shares the less revolutionary secrets he has found to getting along and getting ahead in a competitive world.Recounting the years of his own formation\u2014from his father\u2019s birding lessons to the political cat\u2019s cradle of professorship at Harvard\u2014Watson illuminates the progress of an exemplary scientific life, both his own pursuit of knowledge and how he learns to nurture fledgling scientists. Each phase of his experience yields a wealth of age-specific practical advice. For instance, when young, never be the brightest person in the room or bring more than one date on a ski trip; later in life, always accept with grace when your request for funding is denied, and--for goodness\u2019 sake--don\u2019t dye your hair. There are precepts that few others would find occasion to heed (expect to gain weight after you win your Nobel Prize, as everyone will invite you to dinner) and many more with broader application (do not succumb to the seductions of golf if you intend to stay young professionally). And whatever the season or the occasion: avoid boring people.A true believer in the intellectual promise of youth, Watson offers specific pointers to beginning scientists about choosing the projects that will shape their careers, the supreme importance of collegiality, and dealing with competitors within the same institution, even one who is a former mentor. Finally he addresses himself to the role and needs of science at large universities in the context of discussing the unceremonious departure of Harvard's president Larry Summers and the search for his successor.Scorning political correctness, this irreverent romp through Watson\u2019s life and learning is an indispensable guide to anyone plotting a career in science (or most anything else), a primer addressed both to the next generation and those who are entrusted with their minds.",

In these pages, her tumultuous and amazing story comes to life as only Michelle Moran can tell it. The year is 1788, and a revolution is about to begin. Smart and ambitious, Marie Tussaud has learned the secrets of wax sculpting by working alongside her uncle in their celebrated wax museum, the Salon de Cire. From her popular model of the American ambassador, Thomas Jefferson, to her tableau of the royal family at dinner, Marie\u2019s museum provides Parisians with the very latest news on fashion, gossip, and even politics. Her customers hail from every walk of life, yet her greatest dream is to attract the attention of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI; their stamp of approval on her work could catapult her and her museum to the fame and riches she desires. After months of anticipation, Marie learns that the royal family is willing to come and see their likenesses. When they finally arrive, the king\u2019s sister is so impressed that she requests Marie\u2019s presence at Versailles as a royal tutor in wax sculpting. It is a request Marie knows she cannot refuse\u2014even if it means time awayfrom her beloved Salon and her increasingly dear friend, Henri Charles. As Marie gets to know her pupil, Princesse \u00c9lisabeth, she also becomes acquainted with the king and queen, who introduce her to the glamorous life at court. From lavish parties with more delicacies than she\u2019s ever seen to rooms filled with candles lit only once before being discarded, Marie steps into a world entirely different from her home on the Boulevard du Temple, where people are selling their teeth in order to put food on the table. Meanwhile, many resent the vast separation between rich and poor. In salons and caf\u00e9s across Paris, people like Camille Desmoulins, Jean-Paul Marat, and Maximilien Robespierre are lashing out against the monarchy. Soon, there\u2019s whispered talk of revolution. . . . Will Marie be able to hold on to both the love of her life and her friendship with the royal family as France approaches civil war? And more important, will she be able to fulfill the demands of powerful revolutionaries who ask that she make the death masks of beheaded aristocrats, some of whom she knows? Spanning five years, from the budding revolution to the Reign of Terror, Madame Tussaud brings us into the world of an incredible heroine whose talent for wax modeling saved her life and preserved the faces of a vanished kingdom.",

Five centuries have not diminished the appetite for all things Tudor.\u201d\u2014Associated PressIn 1485, young Henry Tudor, whose claim to the throne was so weak as to be almost laughable, crossed the English Channel from France at the head of a ragtag little army and took the crown from the family that had ruled England for almost four hundred years. Half a century later his son, Henry VIII, desperate to rid himself of his first wife in order to marry a second, launched a reign of terror aimed at taking powers no previous monarch had even dreamed of possessing. In the process he plunged his kingdom into generations of division and disorder, creating a legacy of blood and betrayal that would blight the lives of his children and the destiny of his country.The boy king Edward VI, a fervent believer in reforming the English church, died before bringing to fruition his dream of a second English Reformation. Mary I, the disgraced daughter of Catherine of Aragon, tried and failed to reestablish the Catholic Church and produce an heir.

Or is the scale\u2014and the way you feel about yourself\u2014 just stuck, no matter how much you diet and exercise? If you\u2019ve struggled without success to lose weight and keep it off, there\u2019s always a reason, and\u2014surprise!\u2014it probably has little to do with how hard you\u2019re trying or how many calories you\u2019re counting. Now a pioneering practitioner of women\u2019s health care shows why willpower doesn\u2019t work in the long run and, finally, gives you a solution that does.Marcelle Pick, co-founder of Women to Women\u2014one of the first clinics in the country devoted to providing health care for women by women\u2014draws upon decades of experience, her patients\u2019 and her own, to solve the mystery of the stubborn weight gain. Explaining the science of the body with uncommon clarity, she describes the complex web of connections\u2014between organs and systems, hormones and other biochemicals\u2014that keep your physiology in balance and your metabolism functioning well. Because when it isn\u2019t, your body reacts by packing on protection in the form of pounds that won\u2019t budge, an excess that can be so harmful and intractable that Pick has named it \u201ctoxic weight.\u201d Bringing your body back into Core Balance is the only way to heal your metabolism, soothe your body, and lose the weight for good.The Core Balance Diet is a breakthrough plan designed to restore your body\u2019s equilibrium and return you to a healthy, sustainable weight. With her engaging style, Pick explains six common biochemical imbalances\u2014digestive, hormonal, adrenal, neurotransmitter, inflammation, and detoxification\u2014and helps you determine which is affecting you most. In the first two weeks, she teaches the simple lifestyle changes and smart nutrition choices that will show you how to tune into your body and identify your fundamental obstacles to weight loss. Then Pick guides you through a customized two-week program geared to restoring your Core Balance and shedding those toxic pounds once and for all. Far from depriving yourself on this program, you\u2019ll eat\u2014often and well\u2014enjoying delicious recipes made from whole foods that give your body the support it needs to heal. At the same time, you\u2019ll start to explore underlying issues and emotional patterns that may be getting in your way, as Pick connects self-care with self-knowledge to show you the way to lasting wellness.By picking up this book, you\u2019re about to toss out the old way of thinking about yourself and your weight. The Core Balance Diet heralds a whole new chapter in weight loss, proving how easy it is to work with your body and the right foods\u2014not against them\u2014to rid yourself of weight and unhealthy habits for good. Within a month, you\u2019ll be on your way to a lean, fit, and balanced body that is ready to support you\u2014and look great\u2014for\u00a0 the rest of your life.",

That unhappy prospect dampens his spirits somewhat, but Barry has little time to dwell on his romantic disappointments. Christmas may be drawing nigh, but there is little peace to be found on earth, especially for a young doctor plying his trade in the emerald hills and glens of rural Ireland.Along with his senior partner, Doctor Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly, Barry has his hands full dealing with seasonal coughs and colds, as well as the occasional medical emergency. To add to the doctors' worries, competition arrives in the form of a patient-poaching new physician whose quackery threatens the health and well-being of the good people of Ballybucklebo. Can one territory support three hungry doctors? Barry has his doubts.But the wintry days and nights are not without a few tidings of comfort and joy. Between their hectic medical practice, Rugby Club parties, and the kiddies' Christmas Pageant, the two doctors still find time to play Santa Claus to a struggling single mother with a sick child and not enough money in the bank. Snow is rare in Ulster, and so are miracles, but that doesn't mean they never happen. . . .",

Use it wisely or it will be a burden. To empty, pour it out. When not in use, store it upside down and out of reach of children.   \"What on earth is a Full Belly Bowl?\" the very old man wonders -- but he soon finds out. No matter how much he eats from it, the bowl magically refills itself. For the first time in a long time, the old man isn't hungry. Then he discovers that the bowl can refill itself with other things -- even his one copper coin -- and now it looks like he'll never want for anything again!  His excitement makes him careless, however, and as he hurries off to spend some of his new wealth, he leaves the bowl right side up. And who can say what might get into the Full Belly Bowl in his absence?  Fully realized in Wendy Halperin's beautiful and intricate illustrations, Jim Aylesworth's whimsical folktale will delight readers while striking a note of caution.",

        "Title": "This Beautiful Mess: Practicing the Presence of the Kingdom of God",
        "Authors": "By McKinley, Rick",
        "Description": "Already Not Yet When Jesus announced, \u201cthe kingdom of God is at hand,\u201d what did He mean? Uncover the reality of the kingdom of God and what it might look like if followers of Christ practiced its in-breaking presence. What happens when we view life through the lens of the kingdom? How does the beauty of Jesus\u2019 reign break into the mess of our broken lives and world? What if we lived as though a world other than this one was here today? This Beautiful Mess launches a paradigm-shifting journey inviting us to experience the kingdom of God in the ordinary miracle of our everyday lives. \"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field.  When a man found it, he\u2026sold all he had and bought that field.\u201d  \u2014Matthew 13:44 Jesus\u2019 sayings about the kingdom of God just might be the most overlooked of his teachings. Yet the Good News of the kingdom\u2014a treasure beyond price\u2014was what he came to preach.  It\u2019s time to ask:  -What is the kingdom Jesus talked about?  -Could it be already here, hidden from sight? If so, where is it?  -How can I be a part of it?  A new generation is tuning in to the teachings of Jesus and to their revolutionary implications. Could it be that living under Christ\u2019s reign is not merely a future vision but a present reality?  Rick McKinley\u2019s exploration is fresh, accessible, and timely. With careful attention to historical texts, he unveils new understandings of authentic personal and social transformation. The time is now. Your opportunity is here. In the mess of everyday life, you can live in the beautiful presence of the kingdom.  Story Behind the Book\u201dWhen we started Imago Dei Community, it was with a passion to be people who live in love with Jesus and live out the values of His kingdom in our city. But we had no idea how to do that. God let us stumble into grace and discover the wide-open plains of His kingdom. This has ruined us in the best way possible. Because once you taste untamed life in the kingdom, you will never go back to the sterile hallways of religion. The beautiful, transforming grace of Christ shows up in the messiness of life and the kingdom breaks in as a beautiful mess.\u201d\u2014Rick McKinley",
