        "Title": "Holding Her Head High: Inspiration from 12 Single Mothers Who Championed Their Children and Changed History",
        "Authors": "By Turner, Janine",
        "Description": "Life lessons from single mothers throughout history form the inspiration for single mothers today.Single moms are not just a product of our modern culture. There have been single mothers throughout history, women who have raised not only their children but also nations with a higher vision for life. Holding Her Head High recounts stories of twelve such women from the third to the twenty-first centuries, women who found ways to twist their fates to represent God's destiny for their lives.These uniquely powerful, brave women, within the scope of their own world and times, are like the ninety-nine percent of single mothers today who never intended to carry that distinction. They are abandoned, widowed, or divorced, all carrying wounds, yet they also all found ways to exhibit courage, kindness, dignity, and faith to heal themselves by healing others.Actress Janine Turner, herself a single mother, describes the social implications for women and children from the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages to Pioneer days, including a single mother of slavery. Stories from women like Rachel Lavein Fawcett, abandoned single mother of Alexander Hamilton; Abagail Adams, a wartime widow; Harriet Jacobs, an unwed mother of slavery whose autobiography was published the year the Civil War began; and widowed Belva Lockwood, the first woman to officially run for President, all carrying wounds but all offering insight, wisdom, and encouragement. Lessons include:Listen for God's higher callingHold your head highDare to dreamChampion your childrenHeal with humorDon't Give Up Before the Miracle",

New York newspaper reporters plant evidence in the apartment of the man accused of kidnapping the Lindbergh baby and then call him a liar in the courtroom once the trial begins.These are just a few of the many wrongs that have been reported as right over two centuries of American history. All the News Unfit to Print puts the media under the microscope to expose the many types of mistakes, hoaxes, omissions, and lies that have skewed our understanding of the past, and reveals the range of reasons and motivations\u2014from boredom and haste to politics and greed-behind them.

White, and many others, this book covers the stories behind the stories to refine incorrect \"\"first drafts\"\" of history from the Revolutionary War era to more recent times.\"\"All the News Unfit to Print is a rollicking joyride that careens through the ridiculous, the odd, and the serious malfeasances in American journalistic history and reminds us of the difference between news and facts.\"\"\u2014Neal Gabler, author of Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination",

        "Title": "Active Liberty: Interpreting Our Democratic Constitution",
        "Authors": "By Breyer, Stephen",
        "Description": "This book, based on the Tanner lectures on Human Values that Justice Stephen Breyer delivered at Harvard University in November 2004, defines the term \u201cactive liberty\u201d as a sharing of the nation\u2019s sovereign authority with its citizens. Regarding the Constitution as a guide for the application of basic American principles to a living and changing society rather than as an arsenal of rigid legal means for binding and restricting it, Justice Breyer argues that the genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems.  Giving us examples of this approach in the areas of free speech, federalism, privacy, affirmative action, statutory interpretation, and administrative law, Justice Breyer states that courts should take greater account of the Constitution\u2019s democratic nature when they interpret constitutional and statutory texts. He also insists that the people, through participation in community life, can and must develop the experience necessary to govern their own affairs. His distinctive contribution to the federalism debate is his claim that deference to congressional power can actually promote democratic participation rather than thwart it. He argues convincingly that although Congress is not perfect, it has done a better job than either the executive or judicial branches at balancing the conflicting views of citizens across the nation, especially during times of national crisis. With a fine appreciation for complexity, Breyer reminds all Americans that Congress, rather than the courts, is the place to resolve policy disputes.  Active Liberty is a declaration of the first importance, made by a judge often regarded as one of the court\u2019s most brilliant members.",

They have fought from the Revolutionary War to Afghanistan and Iraq, in famous battles become bone and sinew of American lore. But why do Marines fight? Why fight so well? Why run toward the guns? Now comes a thrilling new book, pounding and magnificent in scope, by the author some Marines consider the unofficial \u201cpoet laureate\u201d of their Corps.James Brady interviews combat Marines from wars ranging from World War II to Afghanistan, their replies in their own individual voices unique and powerful, an authentically American story of a country at war, as seen through the eyes of its warriors.\u00a0\u00a0 Culling his own correspondence and comradeship with hundreds of fellow Marines, Brady compiles a story---lyrical and historical---of the motivations and emotions behind this compelling question. Included are the accounts of Senator James Webb and his lance corporal son, Jim; New York City police commissioner Ray Kelly; Yankee second baseman (and Marine fighter pilot) Jerry Coleman, and of teachers, firemen, authors, cops, Harvard football players, and just plain grunts, as well as the unforgettable story of Jack Rowe, who lost an eye and other parts and now grows avocados and chases rattlesnakes. Their stories poignantly and profoundly illustrate the lives and legacies of battlefront Marines.\u00a0Why Marines Fight is a ruthlessly candid book about professional killers not ashamed to recall their doubts as well as exult in their savagely triumphant battle cries.\u00a0 A book of weight and heft that Marines, and Americans everywhere, will want to read, and may find impossible to forget.\u00a0Praise for James Brady\u00a0The Scariest Place in the World\u201c[A] graceful, even elegant, and always eloquent tribute to men at arms in a war that, in a way, never ended.\u201d---Kirkus Reviews\u201cJames Brady has done it again.\u00a0 A riveting and illuminating insight into a dark corner of the world.\u201d---Tim Russert, NBC\u2019s Meet the Press\u00a0The Coldest War\u201cHis story reads like a novel, but it is war reporting at its best---a graphic depiction, in all its horrors, of the war we\u2019ve almost forgotten.\u201d---Walter Cronkite\u201cA marvelous memoir.

Susan Gregory Thomas offers even more unnerving epiphanies: the lack of evidence that \u201ceducational\u201d shows and toys provide any educational benefit at all for young children and the growing evidence that some of these products actually impair early development and could harm our kids socially and cognitively for life. Underlying these revelations is a dangerous economic and cultural shift: our kids are becoming consumers at alarmingly young ages and suffering all the ills that rampant materialism used to visit only on adults -- from anxiety to hypercompetitiveness to depression. Thomas blends prodigious reportage with an empathetic voice. Her two daughters were toddlers while she wrote this book, and she never loses sight of the temporal and emotional challenges that parents face. She shows how we can help our kids live at their natural pace, not the frenetic clip that serves only the toddler-industrial complex. Buy, Buy Baby helps us fight the power marketers wield by exposing the false fears they spread.",

The Blue Manuscript is the ultimate prize for any collector of Islamic treasures. But does it still exist, and if so, can it be found? In search of answers to these questions, an assortment of archaeologists heads for a remote area of Egypt, where they work with local villagers to excavate a promising site.But as social and cultural preconceptions amongst both visitors and hosts start to unravel, the mystery seems only to deepen and darken ... What do the fables of the village storyteller mean for the westerners, and can their emotional equilibrium and scholarly integrity survive exposure to the realities of the world they have studied from afar?Interspersed with the testimony of the early medieval calligrapher who created the Blue Manuscript, Sabiha Al Khemir's subtle, graceful narrative builds into a rich tapestry of love, hope, despair, greed, fear and betrayal. Intensified at every turn by the uneasy relationship between Islam past and present, and between Islam and the West, The Blue Manuscript is a novel which will resonate long after the astonishing solution to its mystery has finally been revealed.",

Peter\u2019s dad should be proud.\u201d--Otto Penzler\u201cA strong debut that combines a tight plot (about a deadly double-cross in the woods of Michigan) with memorable characters and dialogue\u2014come to think of it, not unlike what Leonard\u2019s father, Elmore Leonard, creates.\u201d--Seattle Times\u201cAn outstanding debut\u2026.Leonard, the son of grandmaster mystery writer Elmore Leonard, deftly utilizes frequent flashback scenes in a tense tale that\u2019s easily one of the best crime novels of the year.\u201d--East Lansing Journal\u201cThe best parts of the novel concern the crooks, who, if not as gloriously quirky as those in Elmore Leonard\u2019s novels, are sometimes funny and sometimes scary.\u201d--Washington Post\"Peter Leonard's energetic style makes one forget the name Elmore and concentrate on the Leonard....Good writing may be in his genes, but the style's all his own.\" --Oline Cogdill, The South Florida Sun-SentinelOne of the most riveting and powerful new voices in crime fiction, Peter Leonard delivers a razor-sharp debut thriller.Kate McCall\u2019s husband has been killed by her son, Luke, in a tragic bow-hunting accident. While Kate struggles with her son\u2019s surly guilt, her first love, Jack, an ex-con, reappears, along with a crew of his former \u201ccolleagues.\u201d While Jack must convince his partners in crime that he really did lose the heist money, his appearance sets into motion a series of events culminating in a life-and-death confrontation with a gang of killers.Leonard displays remarkable maturity for a first-time novelist in both the plotting of the story and the language of his protagonists. The twists and turns of a love affair, an unrequited crush, and a kidnapping/extortion plot complement a tightly drawn, intimate cast of memorably quick and dim-witted characters.Quiver marks the breakthrough of a new force in thriller writing---an explosive and unforgettable debut.Praise for Quiver:\u201cWith its clever plotting and blood-and-guts characters, Quiver will certainly put Peter Leonard on the map. This is the start of something special.\u201d---Michael Connelly, New York Times bestselling author of The Overlook\u201cQuiver's supercharged plot, rhythmic dialogue, and cool-under-pressure characters kept me reading into the night. An impressive, exciting debut from Peter Leonard.\u201d---George Pelecanos, New York Times bestselling author of The Night Gardener  \"Quiver is a surprise and a delight, a twisty deadpan troll through some very devious neighborhoods.  I welcome Peter Leonard and look forward to whatever he wants to offer next.\" --- Donald Westlake\"Quiver is terrific.  I have to make the corniest admission of all: Couldn't put it down.\"---Mike Lupica, NY Daily News columnist\u201cPeter Leonard\u2019s first novel, Quiver, amply shows that he\u2019s the great Elmore\u2019s son. This book is a wicked trip with the creeps and pukes that inhabit the criminal world who collide with a convincing heroine. The setting in the rural north of Michigan is unique and engaging. I salute Peter Leonard at the beginning of what will obviously be a fine career.\u201d ---Jim Harrison, author of Returning to Earth and Legends of the Fall\"Quiver is a terrific debut. Peter Leonard has a good ear for voices, a good eye for detail, and a talent for bringing together elements that can't do anything but explode.\" ---Edgar Award Winner Thomas Perry, author of Silence",

        "Description": "A serious illness at the age of six left Josephine Dickinson deaf overnight. She nonetheless built an astounding career as a musician, composer, and teacher while also writing poetry filled with sound and rhythm. During a reading tour in England, Galway Kinnell was given two of Dickinson's books. Her poems made such an impression on him that he passed the books on to his publisher. Silence Fell, Dickinson's American debut, draws from her previous collections. The poems are set on a sheep farm in the northern mountains of England and tell the story -- in the form of a modern shepherd's calendar -- of her marriage to a Cumbrian sheep farmer, a man more than twice her age, and their life together, until his death in 2004. As the poet Michael Donaghy wrote, \"Hers is a vision edged with mystery and rendered with arresting, occasionally breathtaking craft. She bears, with no small authority, an air of independence reminiscent of Emily Dickinson.\"",

        "Description": "Our close bond with Great Britain seems inevitable, given our shared language and heritage. But as distinguished historian Kathleen Burk shows in this groundbreaking history, recently published to acclaim in the United Kingdom, the close international relationship was forged only recently, preceded by several centuries of hostility and conflict that began soon after the first English colony was established on the newly discovered continent. Burk, a fourth-generation Californian and professor of history in London, draws on her unique knowledge of both countries to explore the totality of the relationship?the politics, economics, culture, and society?that both connected the two peoples and drove them apart. She tells the story from each side, beginning with the English exploration of the New World and taking us up to the present alliance in Iraq. At once sweeping in scope and intimate in detail,  Old World, New World  is a vivid, absorbing, and surprising story of one of the longest international love-hate relationships in modern history.",

        "Description": "\"Sure to provoke heated debate, this book convincingly tells us what we don't want to hear: our colleges and universities are no longer sustainable---either financially or programmatically. Mark Taylor provocatively calls for big changes, both in how we use technology to help deliver educational services and in the role of professors. We should pay attention, or we will pay an enormous price.\"---Joel Klein, Chancellor, New York City Department of Education\"Mark Taylor---a deeply original scholar and nationally celebrated teacher---sees American higher education as a bubble about to burst. For your students' sake, your teachers' sake, your children's sake and your country's sake, read this book while there is still time.\"---Jack Miles, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of God: A Biography\"This is a book that needed to be written and one that must be read. Mark Taylor not only reveals an unclothed emperor; he also provides guidance to those of us who would properly serve as weavers. The only thing better than reading this book would be to have written it.\"---E. Gordon Gee, President, The Ohio State University\"One of the jobs of a public intellectual is to warn'us when he sees a fast-approaching freight train bearing down on us. In Crisis on Campus, Mark Taylor does that and much more. He offers specific and often radical suggestions about how to make higher education more fulfilling for students and more relevant to the networked world of the twenty-first century.\"---Bill BradleyA provocative look at the troubled present state of American higher education and a passionately argued and learned manifesto for its future.In Crisis on Campus, Mark C. Taylor---chair of the Department of Religion at Columbia University and a former professor at Williams College---expands on and refines the ideas presented in his widely read and hugely controversial 2009 New York Times op-ed. His suggestions for the ivory tower are both thought-provoking and rigorous: End tenure. Restructure departments to encourage greater cooperation among existing disciplines. Emphasize teaching rather than increasingly rarefied research. And bring that teaching to new domains, using emergent online networks to connect students worldwide.As a nation, he argues, we fail to make such necessary and sweeping changes at our peril. Taylor shows us the already-rampant consequences of decades of organizational neglect. We see promising graduate students in a distinctly unpromising job market, relegated---if they're lucky---to positions that take little advantage of their training and talent. We see recent undergraduates with massive burdens of debt, and anxious parents anticipating the inflated tuitions we will see in ten or twenty years. We also see students at all levels chafing under the restrictions of traditional higher education, from the structures of assignments to limits on courses of study. But it doesn't have to be this way.Accommodating the students of today and anticipating those of tomorrow, attuned to schools' financial woes and the skyrocketing cost of education, Taylor imagines a new system---one as improvisational, as responsive to new technologies and as innovative as are the young members of the iPod and Facebook generation.In Crisis on Campus, we have an iconoclastic, necessary catalyst for a national debate long overdue.",

        "Authors": "By Verdon, John",
        "Description": "An extraordinary fiction debut, Think of a Number is an exquisitely plotted novel of suspense that grows relentlessly darker and more frightening as its pace accelerates, forcing its deeply troubled characters to moments of startling self-revelation. Arriving in the mail over a period of weeks are taunting letters that end with a simple declaration, \u201cThink of any number\u2026picture it\u2026now see how well I know your secrets.\u201d  Amazingly, those who comply find that the letter writer has predicted their random choice exactly.  For Dave Gurney, just retired as the NYPD\u2019s top homicide investigator and forging a new life with his wife, Madeleine, in upstate New York, the letters are oddities that begin as a diverting puzzle but quickly ignite a massive serial murder investigation. What police are confronted with is a completely baffling killer, one who is fond of rhymes filled with threats and warnings, whose attention to detail is unprecedented, and who has an uncanny knack for disappearing into thin air.  Even more disturbing, the scale of his ambition seems to widen as events unfold. Brought in as an investigative consultant, Dave Gurney soon accomplishes deductive breakthroughs that leave local police in awe.  Yet, even as he matches wits with his seemingly clairvoyant opponent, Gurney\u2019s tragedy-marred past rises up to haunt him, his marriage approaches a dangerous precipice, and finally, a dark, cold fear builds that he\u2019s met an adversary who can\u2019t be stopped. In the end, fighting to keep his bearings amid a whirlwind of menace and destruction, Gurney sees the truth of what he\u2019s become \u2013 what we all become when guilty memories fester \u2013 and how his wife Madeleine\u2019s clear-eyed advice may be the only answer that makes sense. A work that defies easy labels -- at once a propulsive masterpiece of suspense and an absorbing immersion in the lives of characters so real we seem to hear their heartbeats \u2013 Think of a Number is a novel you\u2019ll not soon forget.",

        "Authors": "By Caldwell, Gail",
        "Description": "\u201cIt\u2019s an old, old story: I had a friend and we shared everything, and then she died and so we shared that, too.\u201d So begins this gorgeous memoir by Pulitzer Prize winner Gail Caldwell, a testament to the power of friendship, a story of how an extraordinary bond between two women can illuminate the loneliest, funniest, hardest moments in life, including the final and ultimate challenge.They met over their dogs. Both writers, Gail Caldwell and Caroline Knapp, author of Drinking: A Love Story, became best friends, talking about everything from their shared history of a struggle with alcohol, to their relationships with men and colleagues, to their love of books. They walked the woods of New England and rowed on the Charles River, and the miles they logged on land and water became a measure of the interior ground they covered. From disparate backgrounds but with striking emotional similarities, these two private, fiercely self-reliant women created an attachment more profound than either of them could ever have foreseen.  The friendship helped them define the ordinary moments of life as the ones worth cherishing. Then, several years into this remarkable connection, Knapp was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.With her signature exquisite prose, Caldwell mines the deepest levels of devotion and grief in this moving memoir about treasuring and losing a best friend. Let\u2019s Take the Long Way Home is a celebration of life and of the transformations that come from intimate connection\u2014and it affirms, once again, why Gail Caldwell is recognized as one of our bravest and most honest literary voices.",

        "Title": "Jesus Under Fire: Modern Scholarship Reinvents the Historical Jesus",
        "Authors": "By Moreland, James Porter (EDT) and Wilkins, Michael J. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Who is Jesus? What did he do? What did he say? -Are the traditional answer to these questions still to be trusted? - Did the early church and tradition \"Christianize\" Jesus? - Was Christianity built on clever conceptions of the church, or on the character and actions of an actual person? These and similar questions have come under scrutiny by a forum of biblical scholars called the Jesus Seminar. Their conclusions have been widely publicized in magazines such as Time and Newsweek. Jesus Under Fire challenges the methodology and findings of the Jesus Seminar, which generally clash with the biblical records. It examines the authenticity of the words, actions, miracles, and resurrection of Jesus, and presents compelling evidence for the traditional biblical teachings. Combining accessibility with scholarly depth, Jesus Under Fire helps readers judge for themselves whether the Jesus of the Bible is the Jesus of history, and whether the gospels' claim is valid that he is the only way to God.",
