A WOMAN'S DESPERATE GAMBLE At the death of her twin sister, Johanna Benison had begun a journey of no return. Now, the unexpected arrival of Drummond, the domineering Chieftain she'd believed executed long ago, threatened her precious independence.

A PASSION NEITHER COULD DENY Through harmonious days and impassioned nights, Johanna and Drummond reveled in their happiness...until the vengeful King Edward II delivered an unholy ultimatum. Obeisance to his royal command could engender only disaster, setting a shattering price on a woman's honor and the future of their love...",

Dora's logic functions refuse to accept this, so she uses the advanced technology of the 24th century to build herself a body specifically crafted to appeal to Zical, and downloads her computer brain into it.But Dora's sassy attitude makes her too different from the women of Zical's culture. He's attracted to Dora, but he won't make love to her. And while it would be easy for Dora to adapt to his desires, she likes being smart and funny; she's becoming good at being human.When Zical accidentally summons the ancient machines that protect the galaxy from invasion, Dora's mission is to intercept them and bring them back to the galaxy's rim. Fortunately for Dora, this puts her and Zical into very close quarters for a very long time. But much has changed, and as Dora learns more about human emotions and what they mean, she realizes that she doesn't just want to make love with Zical--she wants to love him. And be loved in return.",

        "Authors": "By Livio, Mario",
        "Description": "Throughout history, thinkers from mathematicians to theologians have pondered the   mysterious relationship between numbers and the nature of reality. In this fascinating   book, Mario Livio tells the tale of a number at the heart of that mystery: phi, or   1.6180339887...This curious mathematical relationship, widely known as \"The Golden   Ratio,\" was discovered by Euclid more than two thousand years ago because of its   crucial role in the construction of the pentagram, to which magical properties had   been attributed. Since then it has shown a propensity to appear in the most astonishing   variety of places, from mollusk shells, sunflower florets, and rose petals to the   shape of the galaxy. Psychological studies have investigated whether the Golden Ratio   is the most aesthetically pleasing proportion extant, and it has been asserted that   the creators of the Pyramids and the Parthenon employed it. It is believed to feature   in works of art from Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa to Salvador Dali's The Sacrament   of the Last Supper, and poets and composers have used it in their works. It has even   been found to be connected to the behavior of the stock market! The Golden Ratio is a captivating journey through art and architecture, botany and biology, physics   and mathematics. It tells the human story of numerous phi-fixated individuals, including   the followers of Pythagoras who believed that this proportion revealed the hand of   God; astronomer Johannes Kepler, who saw phi as the greatest treasure of geometry;   such Renaissance thinkers as mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa; and such masters   of the modern world as Goethe, Cezanne, Bartok, and physicist Roger Penrose.  Wherever   his quest for the meaning of phi takes him, Mario Livio reveals the world as a place   where order, beauty, and eternal mystery will always coexist.",

        "Title": "The Puppy Whisperer: A Compassionate, Non Violent Guide to Early Training and Care",
        "Authors": "By Owens, Paul, Eckroate, Norma, and Cranendonk, Terry",
        "Description": "Following the success of his book The Dog Whisperer, Paul Owens turns his attention to puppies. In The Puppy Whisperer, Owens and his protege Terence Cranendonk offer a compassionate step-by-step guide to all things puppy, including how to:    * Evaluate temperament  * Choose the right pup personality for your family  * Monitor diet, play, and exercise  * Train and problem solve  * Provide early socialization and positive training  * Potty train, step-by-step  * Ensure safety and health care, including the latest on vaccinationsWhat reviewers are saying...       APDT CHRONICLE OF THE DOG  \u201cI have never said this before but in this case I\u2019m just going to say it: for its genre, this is basically a \u201cperfect book.\u201d There are three authors, Paul Owens, who is known as the \u201coriginal dog whisperer,\u201d author of The Dog Whisperer, and is a leading proponent of nonviolent dog training; Terence Cranendonk, who apprenticed with Mr. Owens and now is both a CPDT and CDBC, and Norma Eckroate, who writes on the holistic care of humans and animals. The book explains itself as \u201cA Compassionate, Nonviolent Guide to Early Training and Care,\u201d and \u201ceverything you need to raise a happy, healthy, well-behaved puppy!\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what it is.   The Puppy Whisperer is a medium-sized paperback with glossy covers and an eye-catching color photograph of a row of adorable puppies staring out at you on the front cover. Inside the pages are basically plain with bold black headings and cute little doggy bones used as bullets. There are several black and white photographs which are well-chosen in depicting what is being discussed. A little color within the book could have \u201cspiced it up\u201d a bit and perhaps made it just a tad more \u201creader friendly\u201d for those who might have trouble reading a lot of text\u2014however I don\u2019t see this as a significant issue at all.   The book says that it will be a \u201ccompassionate step-by-step guide to all things puppy,\u201d including how to: evaluate temperament; choose the right pup; monitor diet, play and exercise; train and problem solve; provide early socialization and positive training; potty train; and ensure safety and health care. The authors start right off asking, \u201cAre you ready for a puppy?\u201d and go on to explain that, along with how wonderful it is to get a new puppy, there will also be those difficult moments and the necessity of changing your lifestyle to accommodate the new family member. The authors state, \u201cThese early growth stages can get to be a tad stressful for the typical family, so \u2026 consider your financial situation, your physical capabilities, the size of your home, how physically active you are \u2026 the size, age, and temperaments of your children.\u201d So true, and so important.   What amazed me about this book is how detailed and complete it is, in every aspect. I can\u2019t emphasize enough that this book includes nearly every detail that a new owner should consider and learn before they get a new puppy and how to raise that little individual once he is home. The only caveat I must mention is that the authors are using clicker training and that might put off some owners\u2014however the techniques and philosophy stand alone whether using a clicker or not. In just the first few pages the authors cover: how to evaluate puppies; temperament tests; hypoallergenic breeds; breeds and mixed breeds; size considerations; ?climate considerations; exercise needs; where to get your puppy (shelters, rescues, breeders, pet stores); breed-specific legislation and more!   The book goes on to cover all aspects of socialization; getting the puppy to be okay alone; beginning obedience commands; exercise; fears (getting the puppy used to the vacuum, for example\u2014something so many owners have trouble with); and a detailed guide to diet and nutrition.  Near the end the book covers teaching basic command exercises, and does so in an easy-to-understand format. It breaks down an exercise into \u201ckindergarten level\u201d and \u201cgrade school\u201d level\u2014making it easy for the owner to grasp what the puppy should be able to do at each juncture. The exercises are divided into clear steps, and each section includes a \u201cHaving Problems?\u201d set of questions that cover nearly anything that could go wrong when teaching a behavior.   I would strongly recommend this book to all beginning trainers and as a guide to families who are considering getting a new puppy\u2014with this knowledge there should be many more well-adjusted canine companions and far fewer dogs being relinquished to shelters. This book is an admirable accomplishment.\u201d  Valerie Pollard",

A Christmas Carol will be Dicken's most brilliant work yet, both for its mass appeal and underlying political message. But many sinister forces oppose the success of this literary gem. And it is only through faith, kindness and the innate goodness of mankind that A Christmas Carol will become a timeless classic-and that the young writer Charles Dickens will truly save Christmas for all of England...",

        "Title": "Difficult Transitions: Foreign Policy Troubles at the Outset of Presidential Power",
        "Authors": "By Campbell, Kurt M. and Steinberg, James B.",
        "Description": "New presidents have no honeymoon when it comes to foreign policy. Less than three months into his presidency, for example, John F. Kennedy authorized the disastrous effort to overthrow Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs. More recently, George W. Bush had been in office for less than eight months when he was faced with the attacks of September 11. How should an incoming president prepare for the foreign policy challenges that lie immediately ahead? That's the question Kurt Campbell and James Steinberg tackle in this compelling book.   Drawing on their decades of government service&#151;in the corridors of Capitol Hill, the intimate confines of the White House, the State Department, and the bare-knuckles Pentagon bureaucracy&#151;Campbell and Steinberg identify the major foreign policy pitfalls that face a new presidential administration. They explain clearly and concisely what it takes to get foreign policy right from the start.  The authors set the scene with a historical overview of presidential transitions and foreign policy including case studies of such prominent episodes as the \"Black Hawk Down\" tragedy in Somalia that shook the Clinton administration in its first year and the Bush administration's handling of the collision between a U.S. reconnaissance plane and a Chinese fighter jet in the spring of 2001. They pinpoint the leading causes of foreign policy fiascos, including the tendency to write off the policies of the outgoing administration and the failure to appreciate the differences between campaign promises and policy realities. Most important, they provide a road map to help the new administration steer clear of the land mines ahead.  America's next president will confront critical foreign policy decisions from day one. Dif ficult Transitions provides essential guidance for getting those choices right.",

        "Title": "A Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression",
        "Authors": "By Posner, Richard A.",
        "Description": "The financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 is the most alarming of our lifetime because of the warp-speed at which it is occurring. How could it have happened, especially after all that we\u2019ve learned from the Great Depression? Why wasn\u2019t it anticipated so that remedial steps could be taken to avoid or mitigate it? What can be done to reverse a slide into a full-blown depression? Why have the responses to date of the government and the economics profession been so lackluster? Richard Posner presents a concise and non-technical examination of this mother of all financial disasters and of the, as yet, stumbling efforts to cope with it. No previous acquaintance on the part of the reader with macroeconomics or the theory of finance is presupposed. This is a book for intelligent generalists that will interest specialists as well.Among the facts and causes Posner identifies are: excess savingsflowing in from Asia and the reckless lowering of interest rates by theFederal Reserve Board; the relation between executive compensation,short-term profit goals, and risky lending; the housing bubble fuelled bylow interest rates, aggressive mortgage marketing, and loose regulations; the low savings rate of American people; and the highly leveraged balance sheets of large financial institutions.Posner analyzes the two basic remedial approaches to the crisis, which correspond to the two theories of the cause of the Great Depression:the monetarist\u2014that the Federal Reserve Board allowed the money supply to shrink, thus failing to prevent a disastrous deflation\u2014and the Keynesian\u2014that the depression was the product of a credit binge in the 1920\u2019s, a stock-market crash, and the ensuing downward spiral in economic activity. Posner concludes that the pendulum swung too far and that our financial markets need to be more heavily regulated.Read Richard Posner's blog, and his latest article in The Atlantic.",
