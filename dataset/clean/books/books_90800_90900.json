        "Description": "Eat healthfully and live longer. Its good advice. Americans have taken this information to heart, changing their lifestyles to include more exercise and a better diet as part of the new interest in wellness. But as lifestyles change and people eat more healthfully the professional chef and home cook are faced with an even greater challenge: how to create dramatic, flavorful dishes while limiting the ingredients that taste so good, but that aren't good for us.The Professional Chef's Techniques of Healthy Cooking is an exciting compendium of nearly 300 easy-to-follow recipes that demonstrate that good nutrition is the product of good food, carefully selected and properly prepared. Using techniques perfected by the chefs of The Culinary Institute of America, which Time Magazine called \"the nations most influential training school for cooks,\" The Professional Chef's Techniques of Healthy Cooking shows you how you can make nutrition a natural part of your cooking each and every day.Beautifully illustrated with 200 full-color photographs, The Professional Chef's Techniques of Healthy Cooking features recipes with nutrient analyses for such classic and contemporary dishes as Pan-Roasted Tomato Bisque, Grilled Salmon with Southwestern Bean Stew and Jicama Salad, Paella, Tenderloin of Beef with a Blue Cheese and Herb Crust, Honey Vanilla Cheesecake, and many more. From sauces to soups to pastas entrees, and desserts, The Professional Chef's Techniques of Healthy Cooking shows you step-by-step how to make delicious dishes an important part of better eating.The Professional Chef's Techniques of Healthy Cooking introduces the seven basic guidelines for improving the nutritional content of meals, with information on how to boost foods' vitamin, mineral, and fiber content while limiting calories, fat, salt, and sodium. Cooking techniques are thoroughly explained, and emphasize how best to enhance and retain the nutritional content of ingredients without adding calories. The easy-to-read recipes demonstrate proper cooking techniques that bring out foods' better side, such as how to substitute vegetable juices and herbs for heavy creams, how to select and prepare leaner cuts of beef poultry and fish, along with recipes for \"good start\" breakfasts and non-alcoholic beverages. More than just a cookbook, The Professional Chef's Techniques of Healthy Cooking develops skills from market to menu that will help create wholesome, healthwise cuisine.Like The Culinary Institute of America's best-selling book, The New Professional Chef, The Professional Chef's Techniques of Healthy Cooking is destined to become a classic reference chronicling todays modern cuisine.Founded in 1946, The Culinary Institute of America is dedicated to providing the finest culinary arts education to those individuals pursing career's in the culinary field. Aspiring chefs are taught to master the fundamentals of cooking and learn the importance of creative teamwork as they progress through an education program that challenges their creative skills within a practical, comprehensive learning experience.",

        "Description": "On September 16, 1999, rainfall from Hurricane Floyd swelled North Carolina's rivers, flooding tens of thousands of homes, businesses, and communities across the eastern third of the state; taking 52 lives; and causing an estimated $6 billion in damages. Faces from the Flood is a compelling look back at the state's most destructive natural disaster, conveyed through the words of those who endured it.Thirty-seven interviews with victims, heroes, volunteers, scientists, and government officials offer tales of dramatic rescues, sorrowful losses, and the quiet determination to survive and rebuild. The story of Floyd is far from over, and North Carolinians must be prepared to face similar storms in the future, warn Richard Moore and Jay Barnes. They conclude with an assessment of the state's response to Floyd and a discussion of what programs should be initiated, maintained, or strengthened to prepare for future storms.Through evocative personal stories, maps, tables, and dozens of striking photographs, Faces from the Flood highlights the dramatic impact of Hurricane Floyd. It will serve as a valuable reference for future explorations of North Carolina's greatest disaster.",

        "Authors": "By Schweiger, Beth Barton (EDT) and Mathews, Donald G. (EDT)",
        "Description": "This collection of essays examines religion in the American South across three centuries--from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The first collection published on the subject in fifteen years, Religion in the American South builds upon a new generation of scholarship to push scholarly conversation about the field to a new level of sophistication by complicating \"southern religion\" geographically, chronologically, and thematically and by challenging the interpretive hegemony of the \"Bible belt.\" Contributors demonstrate the importance of religion in the South not only to American religious history but also to the history of the nation as a whole. They show that religion touched every corner of society--from the nightclub to the lynching tree, from the church sanctuary to the kitchen hearth. These essays will stimulate discussions of a wide variety of subjects, including eighteenth-century religious history, conversion narratives, religion and violence, the cultural power of prayer, the importance of women in exploiting religious contexts in innovative ways, and the interracialism of southern religious history.Contributors:Kurt O.

        "Authors": "By Neal, Moreton, Edge, John T. (FRW), and Neal, Bill",
        "Description": "A gifted chef, restaurateur, and writer working at a time when Americans were beginning to take a new interest in their culinary heritage, Bill Neal (1950-1991) helped raise Southern food to national prominence. Having rescued spattered and faded recipe cards from the Chapel Hill restaurant they founded together, Bill's former wife and business partner, Moreton Neal, has compiled a book that embodies the diversity and range of his cooking and illustrates the aesthetic that he applied to making meals. Remembering Bill Neal features more than 150 recipes--most of them never published before--from all stages of Bill's career: classic French dishes from La Residence, Southern traditional cooking from Crook's Corner, and fast and easy recipes from home. Moreton's introductory passages and headnotes introduce Bill to readers and put his recipes in the context of his career and his legacy as a chef.Part cookbook, part memoir, this volume both instructs and entertains, showing the lasting importance of Bill Neal's influence in the American regional cooking movement as well as being a muse and a mentor to a generation of Southern home and professional cooks.",

It now appears in 250 newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Examiner, Chicago Tribune, Boston Globe, Detroit Free Press, Philadelphia Inquirer, and Seattle Times. Readers can't get enough of the goofy trio that populate this hilarious strip: Rob Wilco, the single, mild-mannered advertising executive, and his two rambunctious pets, Bucky, the sharp-fanged, self-absorbed cat, and Satchel, the easygoing mixed-breed dog who ends up on the receiving end of Bucky's mischief. The combination creates Get Fuzzy's astutely witty take on relationships between the species.Now, in a size and format that's perfect for die-hard fans and those looking for the perfect gift, I Would Have Bought You a Cat, But . . . will become the must-have little treasure for everyone who craves a bit more of the trademark Get Fuzzy foolishness, or just enjoys a good chuckle.",

Carter and Alice aren't your average delinquents, and the creepy old house where they live is being run by the worst housekeeper since Mrs. Danvers. Complicating matters is Andie's fianc\u00e9's suspicion that this is all a plan by North to get Andie back. He may be right because Andie's dreams have been haunted by North since she arrived at the old house. And that's not the only haunting.Then her ex-brother-in-law arrives with a duplicitous journalist and a self-doubting parapsychologist, closely followed by an annoyed medium, Andie's tarot card\u2013reading mother, her avenging ex-mother-in-law, and her jealous fianc\u00e9. Just when Andie's sure things couldn't get more complicated, North arrives to make her wonder if maybe this time things could just turn out differently.Filled with her trademark wit, unforgettable characters, and laugh-out-loud scenarios, Maybe This Time shows why Jennifer Crusie is one of the most beloved storytellers of our time.",
