        "Authors": "By Fowler, Damon Lee and Stratton, Ann (PHT)",
        "Description": "WHAT'S SO NEW ABOUT THE NEW SOUTHERN KITCHEN?  It's the way Damon Lee Fowler, author of Classical Southern Cooking, coaxes the timeless flavors of yesterday from the markets and kitchens of today. Rather than simply reproduce traditional Southern food, Fowler presents more than 160 mouthwatering, perfect-every-time recipes that take into account how we come by ingredients, the equipment we use to prepare them, and our more health-conscious way of living. The result is food that honors the spirit, the history, and especially the taste of the classic Southern table.  Southern cooking, as most people think of it, doesn't exist. After all, there are as many ways to make \"real\" corn bread, gumbo, or fried chicken as there are cooks. So instead of dwelling on hidebound notions of authenticity, Fowler focuses on the essence of great Southern food, combining traditional ingredients in fresh ways and finding nuances of flavor and texture that may have been overlooked before. This is an unapologetically opinionated and singular book, both colored by the tastes of the author's palate, upbringing, and experiences, and connected to every cook who has ever and will ever step into a kitchen with a Southern idea of flavor in mind. In these pages you won't find \"nouveau\" Southern dishes that simply add cilantro or jalape\u00f1o peppers. You will find Pecan-Crusted Goat Cheese with Warm Peach Chutney, combining the best of old and new Southern elements. Pan-Broiled Pork Tenderloins with Caramelized Onions honors the Southern passion for pig but uses a lean cut of meat. Asparagus Shortcake and Shrimp and Green Tomato Gumbo put a savory twist on old favorites. Pound Cake Sandwiches, made with Bourbon Pound Cake; Orange-Praline Trifle; and Sweet Potato Ice Cream are all soul-satisfying endings to any meal.  With suggested menus and resources for finding the best Southern ingredients, Damon Lee Fowler's New Southern Kitchen is sure to become a contemporary classic and an essential volume in every cookbook library, whether north or south of the Mason-Dixon line.",

North Korea's leaders are desperate to hunt down and eliminate anyone who knows too much about a series of decade's-old kidnappings and murders---and Inspector O discovers too late he has been sent into the chaos.

It saw Lincoln's assassination just five days later and a near-successful plot to decapitate the Union government, followed by chaos and coup fears in the North, collapsed negotiations and continued bloodshed in the South, and finally, the start of national reconciliation.In the end, April 1865 emerged as not just the tale of the war's denouement, but the story of the making of our nation.Jay Winik offers a brilliant new look at the Civil War's final days that will forever change the way we see the war's end and the nation's new beginning. Uniquely set within the larger sweep of history and filled with rich profiles of outsize figures, fresh iconoclastic scholarship, and a gripping narrative, this is a masterful account of the thirty most pivotal days in the life of the United States.",

He is the true chosen Champion of the Domdur. Should the Empire find itself at war, though the claw mark will have long since faded, Malledd will be the one to lead them to victory, by the gods' decree.The Empire has been more than four generations without an enemy, however, and many doubt the existence of a chosen Champion - including Malledd himself.But when the oracles stop speaking to the priests, everyone begins to wonder. In the dark hills of the Eastern lands, a centuries-old promise has come to its end, and an army of undead soldiers led by a dark magician gathers to challenge the empire. An Imperial Army is quickly gathered, and the Champion sought for. Will he answer his call? Or will the Empire fall because of one man's refusal to be anything other than normal?",

        "Title": "Unpaid Professionals",
        "Authors": "By Zimbalist, Andrew",
        "Description": "Big-time college sports embodies the ideals of amateurism and provides an important complement to university education. Or so its apologists would have us believe. As Andrew Zimbalist shows in this unprecedented analysis, college sports is really a massively commercialized industry based on activities that are often irrelevant and even harmful to education. Zimbalist combines groundbreaking empirical research and a talent for storytelling to provide a firm, factual basis for the many arguments that currently rage about the goals, history, structure, incentive system, and legal architecture of college sports. He paints a picture of a system in desperate need of reform and presents bold recommendations to chart a more sensible future. Zimbalist begins by showing that today's problems are nothing new--that schools have been consumed for more than a century by debates about cheating, commercialism, and the erosion of academic standards. He then takes us into the world of the modern student athlete, explaining the incentives that, for example, encourage star athletes to abandon college for the pros, that create such useless courses as \"The Theory of Basketball,\" and that lead students to ignore classes despite the astronomical odds against becoming a professional athlete. Zimbalist discusses the economic and legal aspects of gender equity in college sports. He assesses the economic impact of television and radio contracts and the financial rewards that come from winning major championships. He examines the often harmful effects of corporate sponsorship and shows that, despite such sponsorship, most schools run their athletic programs at a loss. Zimbalist also considers the relevance of antitrust laws to college sports and asks whether student athletes are ultimately exploited by the system. Zimbalist's provocative recommendations include eliminating freshman eligibility for sports, restricting coaches' access to \"sneaker money\" from corporations, and ending the hypocrisy about professionalism by allowing teams to employ a quota of non-students as well as to receive funding from the pro leagues. A mixture of lively anecdotes, hard economic data, cogent arguments, and clear analysis, Unpaid Professionals will revitalize debate about a subject close to the hearts and minds of millions of Americans.",

Gary Nabhan's experience with food permeates his life as a third-generation Lebanese American (with Irish and Lithuanian mixed in), as an avid gardener and subsistence hunter, as an ethnobotanist preserving seed diversity, and as an activist devoted to recovering native food traditions to promote the health of Native Americans in the Southwest. To rediscover what it might mean to \"think globally, eat locally,\" he spent a year trying to eat only foods grown, fished, or caught within two hundred miles of his home with surprising results. In Coming Home to Eat, Nabhan draws these experiences together in a book that is a culmination of his life's work and a vibrant portrait of the essential human relation to the foods that truly nourish us, affirming our bonds to family, community, landscape, and season.",

Always cooked with ease and love, they can be shared with family and friends--or sometimes eaten by yourself.Alison Becker Hurt owns and runs three of the most respected and popular restaurants in the New York area--Alison on Dominick Street in Manhattan, Alison by the Beach in Sagaponack, and Alison in the Inn at Quogue, Long Island--all bearing her name. But \"restaurant food\" is not what she cooks at home, and not what Kitchen Suppers is all about. As Alison puts it, kitchen suppers \"are never perfect--and yet they are perfect in their imperfection.\"In these pages, she shares not only the recipes for but also the stories behind meals that are uncomplicated in spirit, if not always in creation. Here you will find sizzling roasts--from chicken to lamb to duck to beef, cooked with everything from figs to fennel to baby artichokes; aromatic one-pot meals like Lamb Shepherd's Pie, Braised Short Ribs with Acorn Squash Pur\u00e9e, and Duck Stew with Prunes and Apricots; soups, salads, and starters for every season; and homey, yummy desserts such as Alison's favorite, Tarte Tatin, and Dark Chocolate Cake with Almonds and Orange, which, she says, she first made in junior high school.Along with providing the recipes for preparing your own kitchen suppers, Alison also explains the philosophy behind her style of cooking and entertaining: You should never have to run back to the market for a forgotten ingredient, because there is almost always a substitute in the cupboard; and you should never be afraid to use a clean but stained tablecloth, because the stains are memories of good meals shared with joy.",

        "Title": "The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity",
        "Authors": "By Jenkins, Philip",
        "Description": "The explosive southward expansion of Christianity in Africa, Asia, and Latin American has barely registered on Western consciousness. Nor has the globalization of Christianity--and the enormous religious, political, and social consequences it portends--been properly understood.       Philip Jenkins' The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity is the first book to take the full measure of the changing face of the Christian faith. Jenkins asserts that by the year 2050 only one Christian in five will be a non-Latino white person and that the center of gravity of the Christian world will have shifted firmly to the Southern hemisphere. Within a few decades Kinshasa, Buenos Aires, Addis Ababa, and Manila will replace Rome, Athens, Paris, London, and New York as the focal points of the Church. Moreover, Jenkins shows that the churches that have grown most rapidly in the global south are far more traditional, morally conservative, evangelical, and apocalyptic than their northern counterparts. Mysticism, puritanism, belief in prophecy, faith-healing, exorcism, and dream-visions--concepts which more liberal western churches have traded in for progressive political and social concerns--are basic to the newer churches in the south. And the effects of such beliefs on global politics, Jenkins argues, will be enormous, as religious identification begins to take precedence over allegiance to secular nation-states. Indeed, as Christianity grows in regions where Islam is also expected to increase--as recent conflicts in Indonesia, Nigeria, and the Philippines reveal--we may see a return to the religious wars of the past, fought out with renewed intensity and high-tech weapons far surpassing the swords and spears of the middle ages.     Jenkins shows that Christianity is on the rise again, and to understand what that rise may mean requires a new awareness of what is happening in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The Next Christendom takes the first large step towards that new awareness.",

        "Title": "The New Feminine Brain: How Women Can Develop Their Inner Strengths, Genius, and Intuition",
        "Authors": "By Schulz, Mona Lisa, M.D., Ph.D. and Northup, Christiane, M.D. (FRW)",
        "Description": "Ever wonder why most women can juggle the kids, the office, and the kitchen renovation all at once but most men prefer to concentrate on one thing at a time? This is because women naturally have more connections than men do between their right and left brains, allowing them to divide their attention and multitask. Yet this mental ability to deal with multiple pressures and demands can ultimately have both a physical and a mental cost. Stress changes the brain physically and triggers physical symptoms in the body.  Indeed, women today have markedly more problems with low moods and depression, anxiety and fears, attention and memory than women of just a few generations ago -- and markedly more than men. In this groundbreaking new book, the first to focus on the unique strengths and innate genius of women's brains, psychiatrist, brain scientist, and medical intuitive Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz shows you that your feminine brain today is not your grandmother's brain: it's dramatically different from the traditional female brain of your ancestors -- and also quite different from a traditional man's brain. The New Feminine Brain explains how women of all ages can protect their hormonally sensitive brains from stress; shore up their moods, self-confidence, focus, and memory; and heal a host of emotional and physical problems. It also provides important health information for using and improving your intuition -- a fast form of intelligence that traditionally has been considered more readily accessible to women than men -- to help balance mind and body for better health, better relationships, and an overall better life. Dr. Schulz makes brain science both engaging and accessible as she combines scientific research, patients' stories from her clinical practice, and personal stories of her work and life as a psychiatrist and a medical intuitive -- identities she learned to merge in order to better understand her own brain -- to help women more fully appreciate their own distinctive abilities. Questionnaires and quizzes throughout the book allow you to understand how your brain is wired, and guide you in rewiring and bolstering any connections that need it, with mental exercises, nutritional supplements, and the latest information on medications. As she helps you make your brain the best it can be, Dr. Schulz leads you on a fascinating, personalized journey of self-discovery and healing. From it you will gain a better appreciation of your innate genius, your intuition, and the amazing strengths of your new feminine brain.",

Her husband, Richard, works for a humanitarian organization dedicated to the health and prosperity of developing countries and wants her help on an extended AIDS assignment in the Dominican Republic. But Alma begs off joining him: the publisher is breathing down her neck. She promises to work hard and follow him a bit later.  The truth is that Alma is seriously sidetracked by a story she has stumbled across. It's the story of a much earlier medical do-gooder, Spaniard Francisco Xavier Balmis, who in 1803 undertook to vaccinate the populations of Spain's American colonies against smallpox. To do this, he required live \"carriers\" of the vaccine.  Of greater interest to Alma is Isabel Sendales y G\u00f3mez, director of La Casa de Exp\u00f3sitos, who was asked to select twenty-two orphan boys to be the vaccine carriers. She agreed\u2014 with the stipulation that she would accompany the boys on the proposed two-year voyage. Her strength and courage inspire Alma, who finds herself becoming obsessed with the details of Isabel's adventures. This resplendent novel-within-a-novel spins the disparate tales of two remarkable women, both of whom are swept along by machismo. In depicting their confrontation of the great scourges of their respective eras, Alvarez exposes the conflict between altruism and ambition.",

Eight years ago, in Sun Valley-snowcapped playground for the wealthy and ambitious-all that stood between U.S. Attorney General Elizabeth Shaler and a knife-wielding killer was local patrolman Walt Fleming. Now Liz Shaler returns to Sun Valley as the keynote speaker of billionaire Patrick Cutter's world-famous media and communications conference, a convergence of the richest, most powerful business tycoons. The controversial attorney general is expected to announce her candidacy for president. It's a media coup for Cutter-but a security nightmare for Walt Fleming, now the county sheriff.  As the Cutter conference gets under way, authorities learn of a confirmed threat on Shaler's life, and various competing interests-the Secret Service, the FBI, Cutter's own security forces -begin jockeying for jurisdiction. Amid the conference's opulent extravagances, Walt is suddenly shaken by an apparent murder, his nephew's arrest, and a haunting legacy from his family's past.

The pressure to drink and party, cheat on that test, or give in to that guy? How about the devastation of losing a friend, parents divorcing, or low self-esteem? Who can better relate than your peers? This Is Now is a devotional written by your peers across the country who face the exact same things you do. God wants you to find encouragement and support through one another \u201cthat they might be called trees of righteousness\u201d (Isaiah 61:3, KJV). Brief entr\u00e9es and rich Scripture verses are packed with hope and wisdom to guide you through these challenging years. This Is Life\u2014the Real Deal Nobody said these years would be easy. Or maybe someone did\u2014but it was probably an adult who doesn\u2019t get it. Now, in this 365-day devotional, teens just like you come together from around the world to offer guidance through your toughest questions and situations. The entries are genuine\u2014solidly built on the Word of God.  \u201cWhy do we look at the girl next to us and wish we had her hair, nose, or thighs? Did God make a mistake when He made you or me? No way! We are expressions of His ingeniously creative mind.\u201d\u201cWhen I got older; I wasn\u2019t so sure of myself anymore. I wanted to grow up, have a career, get married\u2026but I still wanted to climb trees, run, and play.\u201d\u201cSatan tells me things like, 'You don\u2019t look pretty' or 'Your friends don\u2019t really care about you.' I think these are lies that most girls face. So what do we do with them?\u201d\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the first time I had vomited a meal. It was just that, well, I ate too much. I wanted to take it back. I didn\u2019t think I was fat; I just wanted to be thinner than I was.\u201dStory Behind the Book\u201cThe teen years make up one of the most challenging and exciting time periods in anyone\u2019s life. Teens are faced with temptations most adults either don\u2019t understand or have forgotten about. For the one committed to Christ, pressures are even greater. They look for encouragement, support, and belonging from their peers. Sadly, much of what is found is divisive and destructive. So I figured: If teens are intent on learning from their peers, why not give them incredible peer role models? A book written by teens for teens in devotional format will be an exciting tool for spurring spiritual growth among teens!\u201d  \u2014Patti M. Hummel",

Shane Scully is accused of evidence tampering and his wife, Alexa, discovers Shane\u2019s been having an affair with a beautiful movie star.Charged with felony misconduct in a high-profile solicitation of murder case, Lieutenant Scully is faced with an impossible decision: either quietly resign from his job as a detective for the LAPD, the work he loves, or face criminal prosecution. Rather than smear the department\u2019s reputation and his own, Scully chooses to leave. His colleagues of years feel betrayed to learn that a dirty cop has been in their midst. His wife, Alexa, the chief of detectives, leaves him, seeking a divorce for his dalliance with the accused in the case, a beautiful, well-known Hollywood actress. His son, Chooch, horrified by these events, won\u2019t even speak to him. Life as Scully knows it is over. Or so it seems . . . In order to make a living the only way he knows how, Shane seeks employment from a police department that has been known to hire rejects from other departments: the Haven Park PD. Haven Park is an incorporated city near downtown Los Angeles, just one square mile in size and populated almost entirely by Mexican immigrants, most of them illegal. The department is a hotbed of corruption, in effect the personal goon squad and collection agency of the town\u2019s mayor, Cecil Bratano. Ushered into the department by his new partner, Alonzo Bell, Shane takes his lessons in policing from one of the dirtiest cops around.But things in L.A. are hardly ever what they seem. Relentlessly harassed by an over-zealous FBI agent, the alluring Ophelia Love, and under the constant, violent, and hyper-paranoid scrutiny of his new comrades-at-arms, Shane finds himself in snare a far greater than any he could have expected. His estranged wife may be the only one who can get Shane out of this mess alive. The question is: Is she willing to do so?",
