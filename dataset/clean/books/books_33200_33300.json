        "Description": "During our nation's most trying times, it has been LIFE that has provided the images that help us understand, remember, and in the process, renew. Now the editors of LIFE have assembled a moving, brilliantly illustrated account of tragedy and triumph. This is about firemen going in amidst the rubble, but it is also about a Frenchman in Paris holding up a sign that says, \"We are all Americans.\" This is about our leaders taking charge, but it is also about schoolchildren in Iowa hanging an American flag on a tree in their backyard. Beginning with the history of lower Manhattan, the book explains what happened on September 11, profiles many of the heroes, victims and    rescuers (fireman, police, doctors, and rescue dogs among them), and paints an inspiring portrait if a nation and world coming together in sadness, pride and resolve.The book is more than photographs. Explanatory text runs throughout, and the book also includes a selection of original essays about America and September 11, written by such notables as Maya Angelou, Thomas Keneally (Schindler's List), Stephen Ambrose, Melissa Fay Greene (The Temple Bombing), AndreiCodrescu, Gordon Parks, Doug Stanton (In Harm's Way), Bob Greene (Duty), James Bradley (Flags of Our Fathers), and others. All profits from the sales of this book will be donated to American Red Cross, September 11th Fund, International Association of Fire Fighters, New York Fraternal Order of Police WTC Fund, The National Organization for Victim Assistance, and The Twin Towers Fund. When Americans think of photographic journalism at its finest, they think of LIFE magazine. This book will draw upon the best photographers employed by TIME, LIFE, PEOPLE and other magazines. Many of the photographers have had their own collections published in book form.",

Karl Voss, already experienced in the illusions of intrigue when he arrives in Lisbon, is an attache at the German Legation, though he is secretly working against the Nazis to rescue Germany from annihilation. After a night of terrible violence, Andrea creates a family for herself from Voss&#39;s memory and the clandestine world they knew. In Portugal, in England, and in the chilly world of Cold War Berlin, she discovers that the deepest secrets aren&#39;t held by governments-and that death is a relative term. In The Company of Strangers, Robert Wilson takes the chilling irony of \"secret intelligence\" to a new and more poignant human level, as he shows that the heart is both more knowing and more secretive than the mind.",

Everybody feels much safer knowing that they're behind bars. Except . . . there's a new killer on the loose. And his handiwork bears a disturbing resemblance to some of the finer points practiced by the Big Three, details that never even made the papers.  Davenport and his team quickly home in on a possible suspect, a man named Charlie Pope, who was released from the same hospital prison a few weeks earlier, and who now seems to have cut himself free from his court-imposed ankle bracelet and disappeared. But is he really the one? And why do the Big Three look so agitated?  Brilliantly suspenseful, consistently surprising-once again, Sandford has outdone himself.",

As an expression of human culture, and as a pillow book for the modern boudoir, the Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana the most famous work on sex ever written the Ananga-Ranga of Kalyana Malla, and Sheikh Nefzai's Perfumed Garden, set forth the principles of sensual pleasure with poetry, wisdom, and humor, celebrating love as an ecstatic expression of life's beauty.Here, for the first time, Sir Richard Burton's translations of the classic Eastern love texts have been published in one volume.The first Kama Sutra to be illustrated in color with a dazzling and unique collection of Indian painting and sculpture. These erotic treatises are not sex manuals in the modern sense clinical collections of coital postures but a broader and more humane exploration of Eastern sexual customs.",

Alice Andrews is living in Manhattan, working as a reporter in Newark, and spending her free time desperately trying to forget her most recent relationship, with Miles, the smooth-talking investment banker she had mistakenly anointed Mr. Right. Then, on an airplane, she meets handsome Jack Russworm, a third-generation Harvard-educated doctor. With his perfect teeth and good luggage, he shows all the potential for being the real thing.  The new romance seems to be going well, but the issue of their different backgrounds keeps popping up. Clair, Jack's mother, seems frosty to Alice. Jack's ex-girlfriend, Sherry Steptoe, the poster girl for Black American Princess-dom, is a constant reminder of all that Alice is not. Amid the bougie clubbiness it is difficult for Alice to reveal who she really is, while Jack appears oblivious to it all. Or is he?  Benilde Little offers us a delicious, closely observed, eye-opening look at the world of upper-class Black Manhattan in this novel that is alternately humorous and touching, sexy and bold.",

None loves the land as well as Lorcan, orphaned at birth, who has sought his birthright for as long as he can remember. Exiled from his native land when it was invaded by Alizon, he spent his youth in Paltendale where he was treated as an outsider, especially by Hogeth, an heir of that dale, who resented Lorcan\u2019s presence when both were still young men. When he came of age, Lorcan left to seek his own destiny. Since then, he has fought valiantly to rid the Dales of the Alizon invaders, but not even his efforts can prevent the deaths of many people, and the destruction of many keeps and garths. The war now over, he has survived, but so have those who would plunder the lands of the survivors. And among the plundering bandits is his nemesis from Paltendale, now more bitter and determined to vanquish Lorcan. During his travels Lorcan has joined with five blank shields, who, fighting together for common cause, become his boon companions. Then he meets a young noble lass, from a dale known as Honeycoombe for its beekeeping. Her dale has been decimated by the war, but with Lorcan and his band, she will try to rebuild a home where they all can live in peace. Lorcan feels that he might at last find happiness with the valiant fair maiden. But Hogeth now leads marauders across the dales, destroying what they cannot rightfully have, and there will be no peace in the dales until Lorcan and Hogeth settle their old, bitter score.",

The only place where Kit feels completely free is in the meadows, where she enjoys the company of the old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond, and on occasion, her young sailor friend Nat.

Tax law, labor law, and other policy institutions have not adapted to the entry of women in the labor market, the authors argue, and working women are penalized as a result because these laws favor a single-income household. They examine and make suggestions for changes to work schedules, tax and benefit systems, labor laws, welfare, childcare, school systems, retirement, benefits, and Social Security. Strassel is a writer for the Wall Street Journal. Colgan is an education consultant and formerly affiliated with the Women in the Economy Project of the National Center for Policy Analysis. Goodman is founder and president of the National Center for Policy Analysis, which, with the Manhattan Institute, sponsored the publication of this volume.

Christy Petrino hadn't planned on a vacation on Ocracoke Island, but when she learns her fianc\u00e9 and boss, suave Michael DePalma, is a \"made man\" and the Philadelphia law firm where she works is a front for the mob, she breaks her engagement and quits her job. But no one walks away from the DePalma family business so easily....Only if she delivers a locked briefcase to a motel on Ocracoke Island will she -- and her mother and sisters -- be free.  But after clandestinely making her drop-off late at night, Christy suspects she is being followed on the moonlit beach -- and unwittingly runs into a new kind of terror. Now a witness at the center of a homicide investigation, Christy learns the police are hunting a serial killer they refer to as the \"Beachcomber\" because beautiful young women -- women who in fact resemble her -- have disappeared recently while vacationing at nearby beach communities. Christy doesn't know whom to fear more -- a serial killer who believes she might be able to identify him, or the DePalma family, whose tentacles she can't seem to escape.  Only when she's with Luke Rand, her big surfer-dude next-door neighbor, does she feel safe. But with Luke's asking so many questions about her ex-fianc\u00e9 and his showing up almost too conveniently whenever danger strikes, she can't help but wonder if his interest in her is due to more than sexual attraction. Can she trust this handsome stranger to help her survive a hot and deadly summer?  Karen Robards creates a tour de force of passion and suspense in this scintillating page-turner, the quintessential summertime read.",

Drawing on hundreds of interviews,No God But God opens up previously inaccessible segments of Egyptian society to illustrate the deep penetration of \"Popular Islamic\" influence. Geneive Abdo provides a firsthand account of this movement, allowing its leaders, street preachers, scholars, doctors, lawyers, men and women of all social classes to speak for themselves. Challenging Western stereotypes, she finds that this growing number of Islamists do not seek the violent overthrow of the government or a return to a medieval age. Instead, they believe their religious values are compatible with the demands of the modern world. They are working within and beyond the secular framework of the nation to gradually create a new society based on Islamic principles.Both fascinating and unsettling, Abdo's findings identify a grassroots model for transforming a secular nation-state to an Islamic social order that will likely inspire other Muslim nations.",

Interchange is attractively designed to appeal to adult and young adult learners who want a course that provides them with extensive opportunities to express their own ideas and opinions, while developing the skills they need to communicate effectively in English. \u00a0 Key Features of the Course are: -  Snapshots' contain interesting real-world information to stimulate thought and discussion related to the themes of the units -  Conversations present structures and functions in a situational context and serve as language models for speaking tasks -  Word Power' exercises present and practice key language used in each unit -  Pair work, group work, and role-play activities provide freer and more personalised practice of the language -  All four skills are developed through discrete exercises and within integrated activities -  Special tasks called\u00a0 Interchange activities' provide a communicative extension to each unit, allowing learners to use the language they have acquired in creative ways -  Review units after every three units review and recycle material -  Tests accompanying the review units are in the teacher's book and are photocopiable -  Interchange was field-tested widely in many countries before publication Level 1 takes learners from false-beginner to low-intermediate level, presenting and practising basic language items with opportunities for personalisation right from the start. Level 2 extends and develops language from Level 1, through a range of motivating material, taking learners up to the intermediate level. For intermediate learners and above, Level 3 further extends the grammatical, functional and lexical skills of learners, with challenging contemporary readings and recordings.",

She explores the scenic and musical basis of both textual meaning and interpersonal involvement in discourse. Repetition establishes rhythm and meaning by patterns of constants and contrasts. Dialogue and imagery create scenes peopled by characters in relation to each other, doing things that are culturally and personally recognizable and meaningful. Our understanding of how discourse works--whether it is spontaneously uttered by conversationalists or carefully structured by the novelist or public speaker--is significantly advanced by this book.",

        "Description": "When President Bill Clinton nominated Pamela Harriman to become U.S. ambassador to France in 1993, he was rewarding an extraordinary supporter with a crown jewel from the American political spoils system. Few deserved it more. The glamorous widow of statesman Averell Harriman had sheltered the Democratic party through a dozen years of exile and had used her late husband's fortune and her own drive to raise $12 million for the party and, ultimately, Clinton's campaign.But long before she became a diplomat, Pamela Harriman had an international reputation - as courtesan of the century. The ambitious eldest child of an English baron, Pamela was eager to flee rural life when her formal education ended at sixteen. Red-haired, voluptuous, and sexy at eighteen, when she claims to have met Adolf Hitler, she married Winston Churchill's only son at the onset of World War II and moved into No. 10 Downing Street. A volatile marriage to Randolph Churchill propelled the seductive young mother into wartime affairs with such powerful men as Harriman, Edward R. Murrow, and top generals on both sides of the Anglo-American alliance.After the war, Pamela divorced, moving to France and into liaisons with wealthy playboys Aly Khan, Gianni Agnelli, and Elie de Rothschild. Her second marriage, to Sound of Music producer Leland Hayward, put her at the crossroads of Broadway and Hollywood in the 1960s. After Hayward's death, a family feud, and a flirtation with Frank Sinatra, she married the seventy-nine-year-old Harriman. The former ambassador, New York governor, and presidential candidate introduced her to a new generation of world leaders as well as Democratic party officials delighted to welcome a beautiful and energetic doyenne.Unauthorized, but based on months of exclusive talks with Pamela Harriman, plus interviews with nearly two hundred friends, relatives, and critics, Life of the Party is the first inside look at the spectacular life and rise of a remarkable woman.",

        "Title": "America Right or Wrong: An Anatomy of American Nationalism",
        "Authors": "By Lieven, Anatol",
        "Description": "In this controversial critique of American political culture and its historical roots, Anatol Lieven contends that U.S. foreign policy since 9/11 has been shaped by the special character of our nationalism. Within that nationalism, Lieven analyses two very different traditions.  One is the \"American thesis,\" a civic nationalism based on the democratic values of what has been called the \"American Creed.\"  These values are held to be universal, and anyone can become an American by adopting them. The other tradition, the \"American antithesis\" is a populist and often chauvinist nationalism, which tends to see America as a closed national culture and civilization threatened by a hostile and barbarous outside world.With America Right or Wrong, Lieven examines how these two antithetical impulses have played out in U.S. responses to the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and in the nature of U.S. support for Israel.  This hard-hitting critique directs a spotlight on the American political soul and on the curious mixture of chauvinism and idealism that has driven the Bush administration.",

        "Authors": "By James, Jennifer",
        "Description": "In her wittiest and most insightful book yet, best-selling author, commentator, and lecturer Jennifer James provides us with the tools we need to defend ourselves from-and laugh at-the absurd and harmful things we say to each other. She shows us the difference between \"constructive\" criticism and real encouragement, and tells how we can break the cycle of being critical of ourselves, our children, relatives, friends, colleagues, and strangers. She gives us a way to handle the relative who zaps us with a \"that's a great looking dress, dear, too bad they didn't have your size.\" Or the co-worker who says, \"I really admire your doing the kind of work you do. My pride would get in the way.\" Filled with nitty-gritty advice for both the giver and getter of criticism, James handily confronts the reality that we are part of a cultural tradition that constantly hands out verbal slugs to people. Her book helps us to develop the skills to evaluate and dispose of those critical remarks that can hurt us so unnecessarily, reminding us at all times that one of the best weapons against criticism is a sense of humor.",
