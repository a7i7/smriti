And it was with this inspired, oceanic medley, \"Song of Myself\" (which in the first editions of Leaves of Grass was still nameless), that this great poet first made himself known to the world. Readers familiar with the later, more widely published versions of Leaves of Grass will find this first version of \"Song of Myself\" new, surprising, and often superior to the later versions \u2014 and exhilarating in the freshness of its vision.

Do you buy CDs, tune in to radio programs, go to concerts, and sometimes wonder just what, precisely, all those Italian musical terms mean? In this wonderfully engaging guide, Miles Hoffman demystifies the terms and concepts of classical music in an accessible and witty style. With more than one hundred entries, The NPR Classical Music Companion delves into definitions and etymologies, explores terms with reference to famous composers and works, and calls upon amusing analogies to make sense of music's finer points. Ranging from a paragraph to a few pages, the explanations gathered here tackle both the familiar and the not so familiar, from \" a cappella \" to \" motet,\" from \" opus numbers \" to \" zarzuela.\" The result is a delightful and comprehensive assemblage. For anyone who thinks that only professional musicians can understand classical music, this guide offers a clear path through a potentially daunting world. As much a companion to keep by the radio as an enjoyable book to read in a few sittings, The NPR Classical Music Companion makes understanding music a pleasure.",

And, ironically, it was not in America that this quintessentially American poet was first published, but in England. In 1912, he settled his family in Buckinghamshire, determining to devote his full life to poetry. In 1913, Frost published A Boy's Will, his first collection of poems.

        "Description": "Few volumes of poetry in the English language have enjoyed as much success with both literary connoisseurs and the general reader as A. E. Housman's A Shropshire Lad, first published in 1896. Scholars and critics have seen in these timeless poems an elegance of taste and perfection of form and feeling comparable to the greatest of the classic. Yet their simple language, strong musical cadences and direct emotional appeal have won these works a wide audience among general readers as well.This finely produced volume, reprinted from an authoritative edition of A Shropshire Lad, contains all 63 original poems along with a new Index of First Lines and a brief new section of Notes to the Text. Here are poems that deal poignantly with the changing climate of friendship, the fading of youth, the vanity of dreams \u2014 poems that are among the most read, shared, and quoted in our language.",

She is two thousand years old, a Child of the Millennia, the first vampire ever made by the great Marius. David persuades her to tell the story of her life. Pandora begins, reluctantly at first and then with increasing passion, to recount her mesmerizing tale, which takes us through the ages, from Imperial Rome to eighteenth-century France to twentieth-century Paris and New Orleans. She carries us back to her mortal girlhood in the world of Caesar Augustus, a world chronicled by Ovid and Petronius. This is where Pandora meets and falls in love with the handsome, charismatic, lighthearted, still-mortal Marius. This is the Rome she is forced to flee in fear of assassination by conspirators plotting to take over the city. And we follow her to the exotic port of Antioch, where she is destined to be reunited with Marius, now immortal and haunted by his vampire nature, who will bestow on her the Dark Gift as they set out on the fraught and fantastic adventure of their two turbulent centuries together.",

We are English and England was our home...But our lives were ruled by King James, and for many years it seemed as though our very hearts were in prison in England... September, 1620, our lives changed. We were seventy menfolk and womenfolk, thirty-two good children, a handful of cocks and hens, and two dogs, gathered together on a dock in Plymouth, England, ready to set sail for America in a small ship called the Mayflower... After an abundance of prayers and tears we made farewells at dockside and boarded our small ship. Our voyage across the Atlantic Ocean \"began with a prosperous wind,\" but the sea soon became \"sharp and violent\" and storms howled about us. When the pilgrims set out for America, they brought with them a dream for the future. Sickness, hardship, and heartache stood in the way of that dream. But the pilgrims worked hard, keeping their dream close to their hearts, until they were finally able to make it come true.",

Jackson Brown, \"I thought it would be interesting and maybe even enlightening to jot down a few things more than half a century of living had taught me.\" Soon he had accumulated quite a list. When a friend said he would contribute a few ideas of his own, Jackson decided to invite other friends and acquaintances -- from kindergarten kids and teenagers to senior citizens -- to join the effort.Live And Learn And Pass It On contains the best of their answers, the combined wisdom of thousands of years of living. Here is what we have been taught by our parents, spouses, children, pastors, teachers, friends and enemies. They are lessons learned from loving and winning and loving and losing, the school of hard knocks, and the old method of trial and error.\"Editing their entries convinced me that wisdom knows no age.\" Jackson says. \"Regardless of how much we know, it is never enough. School is always in session, and life challenges us to excel at being both insatiable student and inspired teacher.\"I've learned that a strong code of ethics is as reliable as a compass. -- Age 43I've learned that you can't hide a piece of broccoli in a glass of milk. -- Age 7I've learned that if I eat donuts today I wear them tomorrow. -- Age 39I've learned that goldfish don't like Jello. -- Age 5I've learned that I don't feel my age as long as I focus on my dreams instead of my regrets. -- Age 83I've learned that deciding who you will marry is the most important decision you'll ever make. -- Age 95I've learned that it's easier to stay out of trouble than to get out of trouble. -- Age 14I've learned that whenever I decide something with kindness, I usually make the right decisions. -- Age 66I've learned that it always makes me feel good to see my parents holding hands. -- Age 13I've learned that life is like a blind date.

        "Description": "Once upon a time\u00a0men and women of sense and sensibility knew by heart dozens of poems  - Shakespeare's sonnets, stirring patriotic verse, odes to churchyards and elegies  for the departed, the music of Swinburne or Poe or Yeats. Poems are meant to be voiced  and A Poem a Day includes 366 poems old and new - one for each day of the year -  worth learning by heart. Only two criteria were demanded of each poem for inclusion  in this collection - it had to be short enough to learn in a day, and good enough  to stand among the great poetry of the English language, from Chaucer to Sylvia Plath. A Poem a Day is a book for the bedside. It contains many of the most familiar poems  in the language and others that will come as a surprise. Most are complete and most  are short, easily contained in a single page. But a few are substantial works, like  Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" and Rudyard Kipling's \"Gunga  Din.\" Some have been read by every high school student (Andrew Marvel, \"To His Coy  Mistress\") while others will be new to most readers (Thomas Hardy, \"The Voice\").  But all share the compression and charged meaning which are the soul of poetry. In its British version the book went through seven printings in a year and was a  bestseller. Now Karen McCosker has added a new foreword and fifty new poems for an  American audience willing to make poetry a part of life.",

This volume contains three of Conrad's most powerful stories in this genre: \"Youth: A Narrative\" (1898), \"Typhoon\" (1902) and \"The Secret Sharer\" (1910).In each of these exciting tales, Conrad's celebrated prose style, rich in the cadences of the sea, draws readers into a story that probes deeply, often suspensefully, into the mysteries of human character.

Here are stories about the house itself and how it has evolved over the years, as well as stories about its famous occupants. Best Little Stories from the White House is a fascinating collection of more than 100 vignettes drawn from the life and times of America's most famous and legendary home. Here are stories about the house itself and how it has evolved over the years, as well as stories about its famous occupants.  For instance did you know:  Woodrow Wilson used to chase up and down the White House corridors playing \"rooster fighting\" with his daughter Nellie.  Winston Churchill once suffered a minor heart episode while struggling with a stuck window in the White House. Among the menagerie tended by Theodore Roosevelt's children was the pony Algonquin, whom the siblings sneaked upstairs in the White House elevator to cheer up their sick brother. \"Silent\" Calvin Coolidge liked to play pranks on his staff - he would press the call buttons on this desk, then hide behind the door as Secret Service agents, secretaries, military aides, and other support staff streamed in to look for him. At Boris Yeltsin's first state dinner at the White House - the first state dinner for a non-Communist Russian leader since the nineteenth century - George and Barbara Bush presented him with an automatic tennis-ball server.  Also included are stories of the experiences of several first ladies, including Dolley Madison, Harriet \"Hal\" Lane (niece of James Buchanan), Mary Lincoln, Jacqueline Kennedy, Barbara Bush, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Laura Bush.",

        "Title": "What Life was Like on the Banks of the Nile: Egypt 3050 - 30 BC",
        "Authors": "By Time-Life Books (EDT)",
        "Description": "Like many of his predecessors, Ramses III enjoyed the luxury of a large harem, filled with beautiful Egyptian women and foreign princesses. But harems, while pleasurable, could also pose a risk to a king and his chosen successor. In the 32nd year of Ramses' reign, one of his secondary wives plotted to assassinate him and set her own son, rather than Ramses' designated heir, upon the throne. With great cunning, she convinced other women of the harem, their guards, and some of the pharaoh's closest advisers to join forces with her. Although they would be punished with death if they failed, the conspirators set their plans in motion, determined to bring Ramses down by any means necessary, including witchcraft.What Life Was Like On the Banks of the Nile recounts Ramses' chilling tale and many other intriguing, true accounts of the lives of the ancient Egyptians. Their dazzling civilization, which was born by the river Nile and flourished by 3,000 years, captures our imagination as no other culture before or since. Their magnificent pyramids, colossal temples, and brooding Sphinx never fail to awe and astound us. But even more amazing are other artifacts, ones that the Egyptians never meant for us to see - rolls of papyrus, pottery chips, and tombs - that tell us about the people who built the grand structures that grace the Egyptian landscape.",

        "Description": "A treasury of hilarity from one of America\u2019s favorite radio shows. A guy walks into a bar. Eight Canada Geese walk into a bar. A termite jumps up on the bar and asks, \u201cWhere is the bar tender?\u201d Drum roll. The Fifth Edition of the perennially popular Pretty Good Joke Book is everything the first four were and more. More puns, one-liners, light bulb jokes, knock-knock jokes, and third-grader jokes (have you heard the one about Elvis Parsley?). More religion jokes, political jokes, lawyer jokes, blonde jokes, and jokes in questionable taste (Why did the urologist lose his license? He got in trouble with his peers). More jokes about chickens, relationships, and senior moments (The nice thing about Alzheimer\u2019s is you can enjoy the same jokes again and again). It all started back in 1996, when A Prairie Home Companion fans laughed themselves silly during the first Joke Show. The broadcast was such a hit that it became an almost-annual gagfest. Then fans wanted to read the jokes, share them, and pass them around, and the first Pretty Good Joke Book was born. With 362 new jokes (more or less), the latest edition promises countless giggles, chortles, and guffaws anyone?fans of the radio show or not?will enjoy.",
