No one more compellingly explores the dark impulses that sway the lives of seeming innocents, the needs and fears that drive ordinary men and women into intolerable dilemmas, and the ways in which our best intentions can lead to our worst transgressions.",

        "Description": "The phrase a strong work ethic\u201d conjures images of hard-driving employees working diligently for long hours. But where did this ideal come from, and how has it been buffeted by changes in work itself? While seemingly rooted in America\u2019s Puritan heritage, perceptions of work ethic have actually undergone multiple transformations over the centuries. And few eras saw a more radical shift in labor ideology than the American industrial age.Daniel T. Rodgers masterfully explores the ways in which the eclipse of small-scale workshops by mechanized production and mass consumption triggered far-reaching shifts in perceptions of labor, leisure, and personal success. He also shows how the new work culture permeated society, including literature, politics, the emerging feminist movement, and the labor movement.A staple of courses in the history of American labor and industrial society, Rodgers\u2019s sharp analysis is sure to find a new audience, as twenty-first-century workers face another shift brought about by technology.The Work Ethic in Industrial America 18501920 is a classic with critical relevance in today\u2019s volatile economic times.",

        "Description": "Of Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s insight into the Puritan\u2019s simultaneous need for fulfillment and self-destruction, D. H. Lawrence wrote, \u201cNathaniel knew disagreeable things in his inner soul. He was careful to send them out in disguise.\u201d By means of artfully crafted and compelling tales, Hawthorne explored the destinies and concerns of early American settlers and citizens. In several of the stories in this collection, characters who hold themselves apart from their fellow man fall prey to the corroding desires of lust for perfection. Then they unwittingly commit evils\u2014against themselves and others\u2014in the name of pride. Edgar Allan Poe noted of Hawthorne\u2019s writing: \u201cEvery word tells, and there is not a word which does not tell.\u201d",

The famous opening reveals the haunting power of that dark, forbidding moor where proud Eustacia fervently awaits a clandestine meeting with her lover, Damon Wildeve. But Eustacia\u2019s dreams of escape are not to be realized\u2014neither Wildeve nor the returning native Clym Yeobright can bring her salvation.Injured by forces beyond their control, Hardy\u2019s characters struggle vainly in the net of destiny. In the end, only the face of the lonely heath remains untouched by fate in this masterpiece of tragic passion, a tale that perfectly epitomizes the author\u2019s own unique and melancholy genius.",

Rostow distinguished five basic stages of growth experienced by societies as they change from a pre-industrial state to full economic maturity. In this book the analysis is continued but the focus is shifted, from economic growth to politics. Professor Rostow see politics as an eternal triangle of competing imperatives - of security, welfare, and constitutional order. Using this concept, he examines the political meaning and content of each of the stages as experienced by eight countries; Great Britain, France, China, Japan, Russia, Turkey, Mexico and the United States. He goes on to consider, in the heart of the book, a uniquely political stage: the search for quality which is possible in an age of high mass consumption. Special attention is given the United States. Professor Rostow also examines the character of politics in the developing nations of today, and makes explicit what he sees to be the lessons of history and the contemporary world for these nations. He concludes by using his analysis to speculate on possibilities for peace in the global community.",

While Don Cheadle was filming Hotel Rwanda, a new crisis had already erupted in Darfur, in nearby Sudan. In September 2004, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell termed the atrocities being committed there \"genocide\"--and yet two years later things have only gotten worse. 3.5 million Sudanese are going hungry, 2.5 million have been displaced by violence, and 400,000 have died in Darfur to date. Both shocked and energized by this ongoing tragedy, Cheadle teamed up with leading activist John Prendergast to focus the world's attention. Not on Our Watch, their empowering book, offers six strategies readers themselves can implement: Raise Awareness, Raise Funds, Write a Letter, Call for Divestment, Start an Organization, and Lobby the Government. Each of these small actions can make a huge difference in the fate of a nation, and a people--not only in Darfur, but in other crisis zones such as Somalia, Congo, and northern Uganda.",

So how did Andy Macdonald go from death-defying stunts in his jolly jumper to world champion skateboarder? In his own words, Andy shares all the ups and downs and the spills and thrills, from driving to California in a broken-down car and dressing up as Shamu at Sea World to setting world records and giving a speech at the White House. He's traveled the world over with his skateboard under his arm.   Andy's made the road to sweet, sweet success look easy. But this behind-the-scenes look takes you onto the platform of the vert ramp -- to the competitions, the long hours of practice, and more. It reveals a bumpy road to the top that, as Andy will tell you, could be reached only with the guts that skateboarding gave him.",

There are recipes for soup stock and tomato sauce, as well as cashew ginger sauce and apricot lime chutney.  The homey breakfast and dessert sections provide recipes for muffins and crisps; and sections on pizza, sushi, curries, and Mexican-inspired foods expand the traditional range of vegetarian cooking.A Taste of Heaven and Earth explores beyond the reaches of traditional cook-books by offering contemplative essays and ink drawings that heighten the cook&#39;s sensory experience in the kitchen.

Photographer Bob Elsdale has found an extremely unlikely source of inspiration for this irresistible book on the joys of aging-some enormous but very agile elephants.Even if getting older is no day at the beach, that's just where Elsdale's elephants engage in some surprising behavior. The playful pachyderms frolic in the surf, knock around beach balls, lounge in the sun, play tic-tac-toe, and even enjoy catching waves on surfboards.So what does all this have to do with empowering the elders among us? Lots, as it turns out. The simple but inspired text is full of wry reminders that there are lots of advantages to getting older and endless opportunities to enjoy them. After all, when you've reached a certain age, \"No one gets suspicious when you fool around,\" according to Elsdale's elephants. And, \"everywhere is memory lane.\"A historic herd of baby boomers begins turning 60 this year. And even if they sometimes feel a little weary, they're still young at heart. After all, it's not the body that counts-it's the gray matter that matters. Looking to put a twinkle in your wrinkle? A little rage in your age? We've got just the book for you!
