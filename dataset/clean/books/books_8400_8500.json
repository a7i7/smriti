        "Title": "Jefferson's Pillow: The Founding Fathers and the Dilemma of Black Patriotism",
        "Authors": "By Wilkins, Roger",
        "Description": "An outspoken participant in the civil rights movement, Roger Wilkins served as Assistant Attorney General during the Johnson administration. In 1972 he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize along with Bernstein and Herblock for his coverage of Watergate. Yet this black man, who has served the United States so well, feels at times an unwelcome guest here. In Jefferson's Pillow, Wilkins returns to America's beginnings and the founding fathers who preached and fought for freedom, even though they owned other human beings and legally denied them their humanity. He asserts that the mythic accounts of the American Revolution have ignored slavery and oversimplified history until the heroes, be they the founders or the slaves in their service, are denied any human complexity. Wilkins offers a thoughtful analysis of this fundamental paradox through his exploration of the lives of George Washington, George Mason, James Madison, and of course Thomas Jefferson. He discusses how class, education, and personality allowed for the institution of slavery, unravels how we as Americans tell different sides of that story, and explores the confounding ability of that narrative to limit who we are and who we can become. An important intellectual history of America's founding, Jefferson's Pillow will change the way we view our nation and ourselves. \"We are obliged to judge because we are obliged to do better; to probe the flaws of our predecessors is to engage not in vindictive finger-pointing but to resist hubris and complacency in our own time. Wilkins' book has made a mirror of the past in which we glimpse our own shortcomings \u2014and perhaps even the means for transcending them.\" \u2014Philip Connors, In These Times (full review online) \"Wilkins makes a case for his opinions in sentences that enchant and inform. In its persuasive blend of logic and lyricism, Wilkins's language at its most potent is positively . . . Jeffersonian.\" \u2014Jabari Asim, Washington Post Book World (full review online) With a sense of genuine curiosity Wilkins tried to avoid either condemning the founders too easily by modern standards or excusing too easily the contradictions of their slave ownership. Instead, by exploring the culture and atmosphere in which they grew up, he discovered how much slavery was an integral part of the Virginia society that enabled the founders to create the recipe for modern rights, equality and democracy. \u2014Clarence Page, Chicago Tribune (full article online) \"Wilkins, who describes himself as a 'deeply committed American,' is never less than a patriot here; someone indifferent about America could not write such a thoughtful book. He demythologizes the Founding Fathers, yet expands their greatness by placing it within the context of the times, as well as their flawed humanity.\" \u2014Boston Globe \"When the Founding Fathers were deciding whether to risk their lives and fortunes for their ideals, Benjamin Franklin remarked: 'We must all indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall hang separately.' In the years after their bold gamble for freedom, the hangman's noose played a far darker role in our republic, becoming the lynch mob's weapon of choice for denying African-Americans their inalienable rights. Liberty and freedom, repression and racism, these warring yet braided strands form the Gordian knot of the American experience: A land of visionary light entwined in the darkest recesses of human cruelty. Now comes Roger Wilkins like a modern-day Alexander to cut this knot.\" \u2014J. Peder Zane, Raleigh News and Observer \"This astonishing book by the 1980s antiapartheid leader Wilkins (a professor of history at George Mason University and Pulitzer-Prize winner) provides a brief, but tremendously incisive demythologizing of four Virginian founders\u2014Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Mason (whose stature Wilkins justly elevates)\u2014and their conflicted attitudes toward race, in the process of humanizing them and deepening our appreciation of the internal struggles involved in achieving their greatness, however flawed or incomplete. (There's nothing forced in this evaluation, as Wilkins acknowledges their enormous contribution to activists such as himself today.) Where others routinely excuse past figures or judge them by present standards, Wilkins exemplifies a subtler, sounder approach. Reaching back to England and Virginia in the 1600s, he briskly illuminates the historical, ideological, and socioeconomic contexts that made a burning concern for freedom not just compatible with slavery, but materially and psychologically dependent on it....His insight recalls James Baldwin, arguably the best we've ever had for appreciating the humanity of even the most flawed among us without yielding an inch of moral principle.\" \u2014Publishers Weekly (starred review)",

Chavez had made her reputation taking on the civil rights establishment, the feminist movement, and the multiculturalists. What few people knew was that this hard-nosed conservative began her career among socialists and labor-union officials, teaching in college affirmative-action programs and writing political propaganda for the Democratic National Committee.In An Unlikely Conservative, Chavez recounts her political journey from the Young People's Socialist League to the Reagan wing of the Republican Party-and the sometimes shocking personal experiences that shaped her views. From excrement-smeared car seats to threats of attacks with bombs and switchblades, she learned quickly that opposing racial quotas and ethnic studies carried a high personal cost. But at its core, hers is the story of a working-class Hispanic girl who overcomes a difficult and painful childhood to become one of America's most prominent political conservatives.",

The book details the ways in which abuse is often built into the policies, structures, and operations of many businesses; how the transition from a manufacturing to an information-based economy has fostered a culture of fear; how abuse acts as a barrier to productivity and innovation; and how corporations are endangering their profit margins and potential for future success by stifling their most important assets in the information age - creative minds.Corporate Abuse is more than a collection of the sins perpetrated on the working wounded, however. It uses case histories and actual situations to illustrate techniques on how to cope with corporate abuse, how to reintroduce civility into the workplace, how to return integrity to both corporations and their employees - and how both will profit from these changes.",

Whoever wins in California is likely to win the Democratic nomination, a prize that the Vice President is determined to deny Kerry at any cost. And for all the votes and enthusiasm his passion and personal magnetism have gained him, Kerry's problems are formidable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He is haunted by the tragedy of his older brother, James, a presidential candidate who was assassinated in California twelve years earlier. Kerry has stumbled in his advocacy of abortion rights, and a right-to-life fanatic has pushed this explosive issue to the forefront by murdering three people at a women's clinic. In addition, a journalist for a national newsmagazine is striving to verify the lethal story that, two years ago, while still married, Kerry had a secret love affair with Lara Costello, a reporter assigned to him on Capitol Hill. And now, even more threatening, Kerry is being stalked by the abortion-clinic murderer himself.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This narrative is seamlessly interwoven with scenes from Kerry's past: his youth as the son of a drunken and abusive father; his self-image as the less-gifted younger brother of a brilliant yet distant senator; his reluctant ascension to his brother's place; his poignant romance with Lara Costello. And when Lara is ordered against her will to cover Kerry in California, he is forced once more to evaluate his life, and the terrible cost of his ambition to become President of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With rare authenticity, Richard North Patterson depicts the world of high-stakes presidential politics on the verge of an explosion that is as dramatic as it is thought-provoking. But No Safe Place is also a story of people at their best and at their worst: their passions, their ideals, their flaws. A novel that will hold the reader enthralled from the first to the last sentence.",

        "Description": "The Shelters of Stone opens as Ayla and Jondalar, along with their animal friends, Wolf, Whinney, and Racer, complete their epic journey across Europe and are greeted by Jondalar\u2019s people: the Zelandonii. The people of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii fascinate Ayla. Their clothes, customs, artifacts, even their homes\u2014formed in great cliffs of vertical limestone\u2014are a source of wonder to her. And in the woman Zelandoni, the spiritual leader of the Ninth Cave (and the one who initiated Jondalar into the Gift of Pleasure), she meets a fellow healer with whom to share her knowledge and skills.But as Ayla and Jondalar prepare for the formal mating at the Summer Meeting, there are difficulties. Not all the Zelandonii are welcoming. Some fear Ayla\u2019s unfamiliar ways and abhor her relationship with those they call flatheads and she calls Clan. Some even oppose her mating with Jondalar, and make their displeasure known. Ayla has to call on all her skills, intelligence, knowledge, and instincts to find her way in this complicated society, to prepare for the birth of her child, and to decide whether she will accept new challenges and play a significant role in the destiny of the Zelandonii.Jean Auel is at her very best in this superbly textured creation of a prehistoric society. The Shelters of Stone is a sweeping story of love and danger, with all the wonderful detail\u2014based on meticulous research\u2014 that makes her novels unique. It is a triumphant continuation of the Earth\u2019s Children\u00ae saga that began with The Clan of the Cave Bear. And it includes an amazing rhythmic poem that describes the birth of Earth\u2019s Children and plays its own role in the narrative of The Shelters of Stone.",

        "Description": "The hugely anticipated new novel by the author of The Secret History\u2014a best-seller nationwide and around the world, and one of the most astonishing debuts in recent times\u2014The Little Friend is even more transfixing and resonant.In a small Mississippi town, Harriet Cleve Dusfresnes grows up in the shadow of her brother, who\u2014when she was only a baby\u2014was found hanging dead from a black-tupelo tree in their yard. His killer was never identified, nor has his family, in the years since, recovered from the tragedy.For Harriet, who has grown up largely unsupervised, in a world of her own imagination, her brother is a link to a glorious past she has only heard stories about or glimpsed in photograph albums. Fiercely determined, precocious far beyond her twelve years, and steeped in the adventurous literature of Stevenson, Kipling, and Conan Doyle, she resolves, one summer, to solve the murder and exact her revenge. Harriet\u2019s sole ally in this quest, her friend Hely, is devoted to her, but what they soon encounter has nothing to do with child\u2019s play: it is dark, adult, and all too menacing.A revelation of familial longing and sorrow, The Little Friend explores crime and punishment, as well as the hidden complications and consequences that hinder the pursuit of truth and justice. A novel of breathtaking ambition and power, it is rich in moral paradox, insights into human frailty, and storytelling brilliance.",

        "Title": "The Unfinished Revolution: Human-Centered Computers and What They Can Do For Us",
        "Authors": "By Dertouzos, Michael L.",
        "Description": "If our cars were as difficult to drive as our computers are to operate, they would never leave the garage. Yet everyday we put up with infuriating complications and incomprehensible error messages that spew forth from our technology: software upgrades crash our machines, Web sites take forever to download, e-mail overwhelms us. We spend endless time on the phone waiting for automated assistance.In effect, we continue to serve our machines' lowly needs, instead of insisting that they serve us -- a situation that will only get worse as millions of new mobile devices arrive on the scene.Our world doesn't have to be this way. It shouldn't be this way.Wouldn't it be great if using your computer was as effortless as steering your car? In The Unfinished Revolution, Michael Dertouzos introduces human-centered computing a radical change in the way we fashion and use computer systems that will ultimately make this goal possible.The Unfinished Revolution is nothing less than an inspired manifesto for the future of computing. Dertouzos's vision will change how businesses, organizations, and governments work with each other, and how individuals interact. It represents the dawn of a new era in information technology.Human-centered computing goes well beyond the empty promises of \"user-friendly\" interfaces. At its foundation are five key technologies that will dramatically amplify our human capabilities: natural interaction, automation, individualized information access, collaboration, and customization. Human-centered systems will understand us when we speak to them; will do much of our routine brainwork for us; will get us the information we want, when and where we want it; will help us work with other people across space and time; and will adapt on their own to our individual needs and desires.By exploiting these five emerging technologies in combination -- in our professional specialties and in our personal lives -- we will see a vast increase in our productivity and a marked change in the ways we live and work. Human-centered technologies will make computers simpler, more natural, and more useful to us. The collective benefits of human-centered machines will give ordinary people capabilities that go beyond those enjoyed today by the most privileged. Human-centered systems will give us the gaspedal, brakes, and steering wheel of the Information Age.When can all this happen? Dertouzos says the time to start is now. You can begin simplifying and improving your relationship with computers today. Dertouzos offers dozens of scenarios that illustrate the potential of human centered computing, as well as a preview of the MIT Oxygen project -- a prototype now under development that aims to make pervasive human-centered computing a reality. Dertouzos also provides the new century's first glimpse of how upcoming information technology advances will significantly improve our lives and truly revolutionize our relationships with the computer.This is a book for everyone, professionals and nonspecialists, who yearn for machines that live up to the grand promise of the Information Revolution -- fulfilling real human needs with greater simplicity -- that still lingers unfulfilled. The Unfinished Revlolution is for those who want to enhance their computer productivity and fun, in short, for every person who wants to do more by doing less.",

        "Authors": "By Lemmons, Thom",
        "Description": "Study Guide for ABA In his autobiographical work Telling Secrets Frederick Buechner writes, \u201cMy story is important not because it is mine, God knows, but because if I tell it anything like right, the chances are you will recognize that in many ways it is also yours. \u2026[I]t is precisely through these stories in all their particularity\u2026that God makes himself known to each of us most powerfully and personally.\u201d Belief in the power of such particular stories, both individual and collective, underlies Jabez: A Novel. Jabez receives the barest of mentions in the Bible. In 1 Chronicles 4:9-10, amid a numbing geneological passage, falls this tidbit of information: Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother had named him Jabez, saying, \u201c\u2026because I gave birth to him in pain.\u201d Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, \u201cOh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain.\u201d And God granted his request. (niv) According to some scholars, Jabez likely lived in southern Judah (the southern portion of the Holy Land) sometime during the period 1230-1050 b.c. During this time, Israel had no king but was governed by \u201cjudges,\u201d God-appointed persons with wisdom or other attributes enabling them to \u201cjudge\u201d or serve as national leaders. The period of the judges was, according to the biblical account, characterized by widespread and recurring idolatry among the Israelites, as they observed and began to copy the polytheistic customs of the people they had supplanted in Canaan. Scripture states that various peoples and kings were sent to \u201cafflict\u201d Israel so they would realize their sin and return to faith in the God who had delivered them from their captivity in Egypt. Imagine, then, during this time of upheaval and national dislocation, that a boy is born under uncertain circumstances into a family that has lost the head of its household. Imagine that his earliest memories are of not belonging. Imagine that the mother who bore him and saddled him with a most unfortunate name (\u201cJabez\u201d is Hebrew for \u201cPain\u201d) lives herself under an unrelenting cloud of grief. Imagine that his older brothers ignore him unless they are joining in the taunts of the other boys of the small village. Imagine that this boy, whose life is characterized, within and without, by pain that he cannot understand, begins to catch hints\u2013subtle at first\u2013that another sort of life is sometimes available to certain people. Imagine that he begins to ask himself why even the simplest joys are withheld from him. And then, imagine that he begins to hear stories of a god whose",

        "Description": "Final Argument is the startling story of a prosecuting attorney who, twelve years after condemning a convicted murderer to Death Row, returns to the same courtroom to try to save that same man's life. Best-selling author Clifford Irving has crafted a masterly tale of murder, guilt, and infidelity, set in Florida and featuring that rarest of heroes - a lawyer with a conscience and an all-abiding belief in justice.When state attorney Ted Jaffe gives up his prosecutorial job in Jacksonville in favor of a partnership with a prestigious Sarasota law firm, he does it for the security of his family. But in leaving Jacksonville, he also turns his back on the memories of his love affair with Connie Zide, a hauntingly beautiful older woman, and the subsequent trial of a young black man whom Ted Jaffe prosecuted for the murder of Solomon Zide, Connie's billionaire husband.A decade later, living the good life in Sarasota, Jaffe hears from a client an admission of perjury that draws him inexorably back into the Zide murder case, and toward the nightmarish belief that Darryl Morgan, the man he banished to Death Row - and now only days away from execution - may be innocent.Can a lawyer represent a murderer he once prosecuted? The legal establishment insists that he can't. But Ted Jaffe refuses to accept that verdict. Final Argument is the story of his war - at the risk of his career, his marriage, his personal safety, and the survival of his troubled teenage son - to save the lifeblood of a man he believes he has grievously wronged.What he uncovers about the events surrounding the murder of Solomon Zide, and the truths he learns about his own sexual conduct and emotional denial, combine to make Clifford Irving's Final Argument a superior suspense story, an incisive tale of the consequences of lust, and a penetrating portrait of a modern man caught in a web of conflicting emotions. Its climactic cross-examination - in that same Jacksonville courtroom where the first murder trial took place - is one of the most thrilling in the entire genre of courtroom drama.",

At the Post, she worked for Bob Woodward, first as his research assistant in the paper\u2019s investigative unit and later as his personal researcher for Veil, his bestselling book on the CIA.A recommendation from Woodward led Feinman Todd to help his Watergate partner Carl Bernstein, who was working on finishing his memoir, Loyalties.

Feinman Todd\u2019s involvement with Mrs. Clinton made headlines when the First Lady neglected to acknowledge her role in the creation of the book, and later, when a disclosure to Woodward about the Clinton White House turned up in one of his books.

Does he even exist? In the age of AIDS and no-holds-barred capitalism, the business of betting on how much longer sick people will live is thriving. Is this new market in which life insurance policies are bought and sold a legitimate enterprise, or is it an open invitation to fraud and murder?Carver Hartnett, Miranda Pryor, and Leonard Stillmach all work for Reliable Allied Trust, in Omaha, where they investigate insurance fraud. Carver -- the narrator of this edgy and surprising novel -- is frustrated. His company would rather raise premiums than prosecute insurance criminals. Miranda, his seductive coworker, leads him on and then puts him off -- she seems to have something monstrous to hide. When their friend, crazy Lenny, a computer gamer and an expert with drug-and-alcohol cocktails, dies in the middle of playing Delta-Strike online, a strange and disturbing narrative unfolds around a possible murder and massive insurance fraud. Carver is drawn deeper into various hearts of darkness, and in his efforts to discover the truth behind his friend's death, he ends up betting his own life.Filled with memorable characterizations -- Carver's boss, the shrewd Old Man Norton; Dagmar Helveg, Norton's fascist assistant; regional investigator Charlie Becker, a plain-talking, commonsense cop -- Bet Your Life conducts a stealthy philosophical investigation of its own, in which our hero ends up investigating the mysteries of his soul.",

Gwyn Hyman Rubio\u2019s beautifully written first novel revolves around Icy Sparks, an unforgettable heroine in the tradition of Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird or Will Treed in Cold Sassy Tree. At the age of ten, Icy, a bright, curious child orphaned as a baby but raised by adoring grandparents, begins to have strange experiences. Try as she might, her \"secrets\"\u2014verbal croaks, groans, and physical spasms\u2014keep afflicting her. As an adult, she will find out she has Tourette\u2019s Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, but for years her behavior is the source of mystery, confusion, and deep humiliation.Narrated by a grown up Icy, the book chronicles a difficult, but ultimately hilarious and heartwarming journey, from her first spasms to her self-acceptance as a young woman. Curious about life beyond the hills, talented, and energetic, Icy learns to cut through all barriers\u2014physical, mental, and spiritual\u2014in order to find community and acceptance.Along her journey, Icy faces the jeers of her classmates as well as the malevolence of her often-ignorant teachers\u2014including Mrs. Stilton, one of the most evil fourth grade teachers ever created by a writer. Called willful by her teachers and \"Frog Child\" by her schoolmates, she is exiled from the schoolroom and sent to a children\u2019s asylum where it is hoped that the roots of her mysterious behavior can be discovered. Here Icy learns about difference\u2014her own and those who are even more scarred than she. Yet, it isn\u2019t until Icy returns home that she really begins to flower, especially through her friendship with the eccentric and obese Miss Emily, who knows first-hand how it feels to be an outcast in this tightly knit Appalachian community. Under Miss Emily\u2019s tutelage, Icy learns about life\u2019s struggles and rewards, survives her first comical and heartbreaking misadventure with romance, discovers the healing power of her voice when she sings, and ultimately\u2014takes her first steps back into the world.Gwyn Hyman Rubio\u2019s Icy Sparks is a fresh, original, and completely redeeming novel about learning to overcome others\u2019 ignorance and celebrate the differences that make each of us unique.",

        "Authors": "By Jayne, C. F.",
        "Description": "At some time in your youth, no doubt, you took a loop of string and made a \"cat's-cradle,\" a \"Jacob's ladder,\" or some other type of figure by looping and crossing the string between the fingers. But perhaps you were not aware that this is actually an ancient form of amusement, that it is practiced in all parts of the globe, and is especially popular among primitive tribes. And you probably didn't realize what a great variety of figures can be formed by a single loop of string.This book describes, in a simple and easy-to-follow manner, how to make no less than 107 different string figures, just as they are made in their land of origin. It is the only book on the subject in English that gives a thorough and readily understandable treatment, so that a beginner can follow the steps and make the figures without the help of a teacher. The figures offer an excellent means for developing manual dexterity and coordination between brain and hand, and present challenge to personal inventiveness, too, since they are capable of infinite variations. These games are fun for people of all ages: intelligent children can do them easily, and adults find great enjoyment in them. Two people can play the string games together, one using his left and the other his right; and many of the games even require four hands.The description of each figure and the process of making it is accompanied by several simply drawn sketches that show each distinct step as it would be viewed by the person making the figure. The illustrator has taken great care to show in each sketch all the loops, all the intertwinings as they should appear at each stage in the process, so that there is no reason for anyone to have undue difficulty in making any of the figures.Besides those who simply want to use the book as a source of amusement, the book will be of great interest to anthropologists and collectors of string figures, since it greatly increases the knowledge of string games and their distribution around the world.",

She's thirteen, wise-mouthed but wounded, having bid her childhood goodbye.

But hey, becoming a widow at thirty-three kind of knocks the starch out of you.  It's about family.  Then Emily's dad has an Event (only her mom would call a minor heart attack that -- what is it, a bar mitzvah?). Next, her sister Claudia's ex-husband starts stealing their kids' Ritalin for the high -- and wouldn't you replace it with The Pill to teach him a lesson? (His unexpected, uh, frontal development was just a howlingly funny bonus -- honest.) And then Emily's relentlessly sensible oldest sister, Leah, dumps her businessman fianc\u00e9 for a rock musician.  It's about never letting them see your gray.  Now Jake, Emily's best friend, seems to be spending a lot of time at her house. Which she likes way too much. Which is kind of confusing. So what's a girl to do, but call an emergency meeting of the sisters' monthly hair-color-and-gossip session, to make the world seem sane again?",

Often called the second oldest profession, espionage has played and continues to play a pivotal role in world events. Stealing plans, knowing an enemy's capabilities and deceiving an opponent are vital in both war and peacetime. Centuries ago, Sun Tzu (The Art of War) made extensive use of spies and believed the ideal way to defeat an opponent was to avoid battle altogether with deception and clever maneuvers to confuse, distract and ultimately triumph over the enemy. In 1780, George Washington's spies, the Culper Ring spy network, tracked enemy ships by communicating with invisible inks and signals like hanging a set number of handkerchiefs on a clothesline.     Spying and spy technology has evolved from sending signals through handkerchiefs and cracking the code of the Enigma machine            to current intelligence techniques that rely on satellite imagery and monitoring of cellphone and internet communications. With case studies and hundreds of photographs, Hidden Secrets is an intriguing look at all these surveillance techniques, spy technology and the spies themselves.",

Now, for the first time ever, the Korean War has a novel that captures that courage and sacrifice.When Captain Thomas Verity, USMC, is called back to action, he must leave his Georgetown home, career, and young daughter and rush to Korea to monitor Chinese radio transmissions.  At first acting in an advisory role, he is abruptly thrust into MacArthur's last daring and disastrous foray-the Chosin Reservoir campaign-and then its desperate retreat. Time magazine at the time recounted the retreat this way: \"The running fight of the Marines...was a battle unparalleled in U.S. military history.  It had some aspects of Bataan, some of Anzio, some of Dunkirk, some of Valley Forge, and some of 'the retreat of the 10,000' as described in Xenophon's Anabasis.\" The Marines of Autumn is a stunning, shattering novel of war illuminated only by courage, determination, and Marine Corps discipline.  And by love: of soldier for soldier, of men and their women, and of a small girl in Georgetown, whose father promised she would dance with him on the bridges of Paris. A child Captain Tom Verity fears he may never see again.In The Marines of Autumn, James Brady captures our imagination and shocks us into a new understanding of war.",
