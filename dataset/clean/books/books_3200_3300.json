        "Title": "Workfare or Fair Work: Women, Welfare, and Government Work Programs",
        "Authors": "By Rose, Nancy Ellen",
        "Description": "Can the welfare system\u00a0 in the United States accord  people dignity? That question is often left out of the current debates  over welfare and workfare. In this provocative book, Nancy Rose argues  that the United States has been successful in the past\u2013\u2013notably during  the New Deal and in the 1970s\u2013\u2013at shaping programs that gave people  \u201cfair work.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, as Rose documents, those innovative  job creation programs were voluntary and were mainly directed at  putting men back to work. Women on welfare, and especially women of  color,\u00a0 continue to be forced into a very different kind of program:  mandatory, punitive, and demeaning. Such workfare programs are set up  for failure. They rarely train women for jobs with futures, they ignore  the needs of the women\u2019s families, and they do not pay an honest wage.  They perpetuate poverty rather than prevent it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rose  uses the history of U.S. job creation programs to show alternatives to  mandatory workfare. Any effort to redesign welfare in America needs to  pay close attention to the lessons drawn from this perceptive analysis  of the history of women, welfare, and work. This is an indispensable  book for students, scholars, policymakers, politicians, and  activists\u2013\u2013for everyone who knows the system is broken and wants to fix  it.",

Is the murder related in some way to the star-crossed and rather irritable young lovers who have appealed to Robin for help? Or to a deadly catfight between rival lovers of the dead man? And how do the cake-baking nuns of Immaculate Confection, Inc., figure in it?To sort it out, Robin must brave the whole downtown scene and more: guerrilla artists, jealous women, Zen bodybuilders, gouty widows, and befuddled tourists. It could make a girl crazy, having to dig deep into the history of the venerable hotel nicknamed (not without reason) \"the mother ship.\" Oh, plus ... one final, terrible complication: Robin seems to have fallen accidentally in love.",

In surprisingly easy stages, you are shown how to collate a book, sew it, back it, trim it, make boards, and attach them to the book. Step-by-step instructions and hundreds of photographs and diagrams of equipment and key operations reduce the process to essentials.Individual chapters are devoted to single-sectioned, multi-sectioned, and case-bound books, hollow-backed and library style binding, the use of end papers, and the most practical methods of lettering the finished book. The author includes a valuable appendix which summarizes the precise steps followed in each operation in convenient tabular form.An elementary text, simple enough for the beginner yet containing new material of interest to the expert, Basic Bookbinding avoids intricate techniques and elaborate equipment. Mr. Lewis, twice first prize winner in national competition, presents the subject with the clarity born of many years of experience in teaching bookbinding.",

        "Title": "Roadrunner: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Thomas, Trisha R.",
        "Description": "1. The opening chapter of Roadrunner reveals Dell's state of despair. He relies on a cocktail of prescription drugs to take him to a zone where there are 'no paparazzi, no reporters, no questions he couldn't answer.' Do you get the impression that the bulk of these unanswerable questions come from the press, or from his family? Who is he trying to escape from? Is your first reaction to Dell pity or revulsion? Does that reaction change at any point in the story? 2. Just before their violent incident, Leah offers Dell a choice between his family and his misery. Do you think she is right to lay it all on the line at this point? How far should a spouse go to help his/her partner recover from an addiction or a debilitating depression? Does your answer change when you factor children into the equation? Why or why not? 3. Dell fantasizes about his pre-injury athletic prowess: 'Crouched in stance, anticipating the speed and shape of the ball . . . the crack of the bat . . . the run!' But he also dwells on his golden reputation: 'the high unmatched by any other, fans, superiority, and recognition.' Is he addicted to the game of baseball, or simply to fame? Do you think the cult of personality that the professional sports world engenders is necessarily corrupting? Or does it serve a useful purpose in providing kids with recognizable heroes? 4. As the squad car pulls up to her house, Leah recognizes that a severe shift in balance has just occurred between 'what her life really was and what she thought it ought to be.' Weeks later, as she fends off one of Angel's stronger advances, she laments that 'This wasn't supposed to be her life . . . This wasn't supposed to be happening.' Where else in the novel do we see the theme of shattered expectations and thwarted 'supposed to's? Which characters are able to adapt to the disappointments of reality, and which are destroyed by them? 5. What influence has Leah's mother had on her in terms of relationships? What influence has Angel's mother had on him? What do you think Josh learns from Leah in the course of the story? 6. Dell makes a show of thanking God for his successes in front of the media, but privately considers himself his own god, fully responsible for all his own actions. 'His days and nights had been filled with strategy, with maintaining control of his destination.' In what ways is Angel similar? Do you think Angel truly feels for Leah all that he professes, or is his obsession with her all about him? Given Angel's background, what does the wife of a professional athlete symbolize to him? 7. Does Angel's tragic family situation cause you to sympathize with him? Why do you think he's unable to go through with the dire crimes he contemplates, Squire's murder and Dell's murder among them? Is he a coward? 8. In what ways does Roadrunner address the theme of addiction? What is Leah addicted to? Angel? Elicia? Does anyone make a full recovery by the end of the novel? 9. Angel's behavior with Kayla seems to seal the deal that he's a creep. Does he overstep his bounds before this? At what point do you lose trust in Angel? Would Leah be justified in filing a sexual harassment charge against him? Why does she never consider doing so? 10. Dell often hides in his son's room because Leah 'rarely came down the hall past the point where organization and structure became disheveled, where mess and clutter lurked behind every closed door . . . She simply asked that the children's doors be kept closed so what she didn't know wouldn't hurt her.' Is this Leah's key problem\u2014that she can't process life's messiness? If so, does Dell recognize it as a problem? 11. Right before Dell decides to piece together the puzzle of who and where he is, he awakens from an exhausting baseball dream to the realization that 'he was merely a man, nothing more.' Do you read this as a final defeat for Dell, or as a positive turning point? 12. Angel is profoundly affected by the discovery that his childhood idol has devolved into a drug-addled wife-beater. How much of his treatment of Dell is motivated by anger at having his own bubble burst? Does he pursue Leah because he has a newfound sense of his own potential, or because he wants to prove a point about men like Dell wasting their precious gifts? 13. Since money is no object in the Fletcher household, are you surprised that Leah fails to hire detectives to hunt for Dell? Is her judgment impaired by her own ambivalent feelings about her marriage, and her growing weakness toward Angel's advances? Or is she simply so used to Dell making the household decisions that she's paralyzed without him? What course of action would you take in her shoes? 14. As Leah contemplates the events that have led her and Dell to their predicament, she recalls him not as an equal partner, but as an 'opponent,' forging ahead rapidly toward his goals, while she is left 'trailing behind like a quiet breeze.' How much of her behavior toward him is motivated by jealousy and/or resentment that he pursued his dream while she raised the kids? What could they have done to ensure more equality in the marriage?",

        "Description": "The topic of retirement becomes increasingly compelling as the U.S. population ages. It's easy to find books about how to plan financially for those years after careers end, but Breaking the Watch focuses on the many ways of creating a life, not just making a living, as a retired person.This book follows women and men from a rural American community as they approach and experience the first years of retirement. Joel Savishinsky focuses on the efforts people make to find meaning in a stage of life American culture often views in a confused or disdainful way.In conversations and stories, 13 men and 13 women demonstrate a deep commitment to defining their own retirement. They bring to their mature years a diversity of backgrounds, interests, and responsibilities. They include former teachers, librarians, doctors, farmers, lawyers, bankers, mail carriers, and secretaries. Some are married, others divorced or single; many have children and grandchildren, but some have neither. Their finances run the gamut from the modest to the munificent, while their health ranges from robust to disabled. From an examination of the \"rites of passage\" that marked their exit from full-time work, Breaking the Watch moves on to consider how to plan appropriately for retirement; renegotiate ties to friends, family, and community; and create a sense of passion\u2014be it for t'ai chi, travel, painting, or politics\u2014that will drive a new sense of purpose. These intimate glimpses into real lives allow a rare understanding of the retirement process.",

What she finds is that winning her cases no longer triggers the satisfaction and excitement it once did. Frustrated with justice-by-the-rules, haunted by the \"knowledge of guilt and misery\" it gives her, and surrounded by people in both her professional and personal lives who believe that the rules can work only by being stretched, Helen is beginning to think they may be right.Now - as if someone had designed a test case for her - Helen becomes involved in the private and legal life of a battered woman whose shockingly dire circumstances might, to some minds, be deemed excuse enough for even the most gruesome crime. As the \"truth\" about the woman's actions is revealed - piece by piece, version by version - Helen must confront the arrogance and cynicism that have crept up around her sense of compassion and justice, and that may have skewed her judgment, shrouding her conscience in order to keep it clear...",

Faithful readers will find their old favorites and develop new ones, while the uninitiated have the enviable good fortune of experiencing this true American voice for the first time.\"A treasure trove lies between these covers. Royko was in a class by himself. He was a true original.\"\u2014Ann Landers\"The joy of One More Time is Royko in his own words.\"\u2014Mary Eileen O'Connell,New York Times Book Review\"Reading a collection of Royko's columns is even more of a pleasure than encountering them one by one, and that is a large remark for he rarely wrote a piece that failed to wake you up with his hard-earned moral wit. Three cheers for Royko!\"\u2014Norman Mailer\"Powerful, punchy, amazingly contemporary.\"\u2014Neil A. Grauer, Cleveland Plain Dealer\"This crackling collection of his own favorite columns as well as those beloved by his fans reminds us just how much we miss the gruff, compassionate voice of Mike Royko.\"\u2014Jane Sumner,Dallas Morning News\"A marvelous road map through four decades of America.\"\u2014Elizabeth Taylor, Chicago Tribune Books\"Royko was an expert at finding universal truths in parochial situations, as well as in the larger issues\u2014war and peace, justice and injustice, wealth and poverty\u2014he examined. Think ofOne More Time as one man's pungent commentary on life in these United States over the last few decades.\"\u2014Booklist\"Royko was one of the most respected and admired people in the business, by readers and colleagues alike. . . . Savor [his sketches] while you can.\"\u2014Jonathan Yardley,Washington Post Book World\"Book collections of columns aren't presumed to be worth reading. This one is, whether or not you care about newspapering or Chicago.\"\u2014Neil Morgan,San Diego Union-Tribune\"A treasure house for journalism students, for would-be writers, for students of writing styles, for people who just like to laugh at the absurdity of the human condition or, as Studs Terkel said, for those who will later seek to learn what it was really like in the 20th century.\"\u2014Georgie Anne Geyer, Washington Times\"Full of astonishments, and the greatest of these is Royko's technical mastery as a writer.\"\u2014Hendrik Hertzberg,New Yorker\"A great tribute to an American original, a contrarian blessed with a sense of irony and a way with words.\"\u2014Bob Minzesheimer,USA Today\"In this posthumous collection of his columns, journalist Royko displays the breezy wit that made him so beloved in the Windy City.\"\u2014People",

        "Description": "\"Essays of considerable literary erudition and sophistication that... dislodge dull stereotypes to enable both women and men readers to see the Bible with fresh eyes.\"--Los Angeles Times Book ReviewAs the one work that has held moral and religious sway over the Judeo-Christian tradition for thousands of years, the Bible is unsurpassed in world literature. For women, its meaning is particularly complex; traditionally, the Bible has been used to keep women in their place, but it has also been a book of enduring inspiration. Out of the Garden marks a new stage in women's relations to the Bible: this is the first collection of essays in which women read and respond to the Bible out of pleasure and curiosity--free to explore what is really relevant to women's lives.Drawing on their own experiences and interests, Louise Erdrich, Cynthia Ozick, Fay Weldon, Phyllis Trible, Rebecca Goldstein, June Jordan, Ursula K. Le Guin, and twenty-one other writers boldly, imaginatively--and sometimes reproachfully--address the Old Testament stories, characters, and poetry that mean the most to them. Thoughtful, challenging, and playful, these beautifully written essays explore the Bible in fresh new ways. Out of the Garden reclaims the Bible for women and shows readers that the Bible is a source we can return to again and again.\"A many-splendored achievement...This grand collection is a bold revitalization of our relation to our tradition. It offers the reader the gorgeously varied company of strongly delineated temperaments as they take on the compelling, threatening figures of our imaginative forebears.\"--Harold Bloom Author of The Book of J and The Western Canon",

Now, well into his old age, he still retains the physical stature and quiet authority that earned him the nickname \"Sea Wolf.\" Ford has always lived a simple life, but rumors abound that he is fabulously wealthy, and the anonymous source of the \"Clare Island Trust,\" the philanthropic fund that has done so much to improve the lot of the islanders.One night a schooner pulls into harbor carrying a figure from Clement Ford's past, and the tranquil life of the island is shattered. By morning, three people are dead, Clement Ford is missing, and Chief Superintendent Peter McGarr is on the case.Accompanying him in his investigations are his young cerebral wife, Noreen, and his trusted lieutenants from the Murder Squad - the gregarious Bernie McKeon, the ladies' man Hughie Ward, and the formidable Ruth Bresnahan. When McGarr starts to piece together what happened that night, he is left only with questions. Who is Clement Ford? What does he have that is worth killing so many people for? And who is doing the killing? Before the Chief Inspector has any answers, Ford and his dangerous visitor surface, and it is all McGarr can do to stay alive in the violent climax of a drama that began half a century ago.",

Scared, lonely, and running from the Nazis, Nelly hides in the bedroom of a Gentile couple in Lwow, Poland.  For over a year, she lives in fear of discovery, writing in her diary and painting pictures of a fantasy world filled with open skies and happy families.\u00a0For 13 months during World War II, the author and her mother were hidden from the Nazis.

        "Authors": "By Wesson, Marianne",
        "Description": "A decomposed body is found high in the mountains of central Colorado. The remains are identified as those of Nicole Marie Caswell, age twenty-two. Ten months later Jason Smiley is arrested and charged with Nicole Caswell's rape and murder.Long before Smiley's arrest, Cinda Hayes had become disillusioned working as chief sex-crimes prosecutor for the Boulder County District Attorney's Office - a job muddled by too many calculating egos, too much machismo, and not enough decency. When the opportunity arises for her to become director of the Boulder County Rape Crisis Center, she doesn't think twice - she jumps at the chance to leave the practice of law behind.But six months after Jason Smiley is convicted and sentenced to death, Cinda is abruptly summoned by her old mentor, Justice Hilton James of the Colorado Supreme Court, and told that the state has chosen her to handle Smiley's appeal. The appointment creates obvious conflicts for Cinda - her new profession is built on defending rape victims - but Justice James assures her that she will not be expected to argue her client's innocence. She is instructed, instead, to scrutinize the trial record for errors that may have compromised Smiley's right to procedural justice.Cinda's strenuous efforts to avoid being drawn deeper into Smiley's case are failing, as Smiley insists that the only error at his trial was the conviction of an innocent man. At a memorial service for a fallen Boulder mountain climber, Cinda begins to sense the truth, which may include a deep cover-up involving Tory and the D.A.'s office. Armed with what she has learned, Cinda must decide whether to defy the court's instructions and demand to have a high-profile death-row case reopened.",
