There's always lots to do - dumping out the potted poinsettias and dusting off the plastic peonies, making sure the kids know everybody dead and how they are kin to everybody living. To most folks, which cemetery, which family plot, which tombstone and what's carved on it are of consequence. And the older you are, the more so.In the Bales-McCord family, two old people are at the point of contemplating their final resting places - Glenn and Laura Bales. Everybody is wondering which one will go first.A third old person looking death in the eye is Uncle Grove McCord, hell-raising, bootlegging, bush pilot, black sheep brother of Glenn Bales's first wife. Grove left Summerlin years ago and has buried several wives. He's got a good healthy one now out in Arkansas. But he pines for Summerlin where he was raised and is making his own private arrangements to be buried there. \"Hell,\" he says, \"I can't be buried beside all my wives.\"Clyde Edgerton fans won't be surprised that the characters in his funny new novel end up with too many graves and too few tombstones. It all happens within the space of just a couple of weeks and it's told by everybody involved, from Buster Douglas, the Truck Freight Limited driver who delivers Uncle Grove's tombstone to Wilma and Harold Fuller, Visitors-to-the-Sick. Join them as they gather in Summerlin to attend to the business of passing on - and passing down. As Uncle Grove points out, \"You're history longer than you are fact.\"",

The only white woman in a pristine wilderness owned by the local Ingalik tribe, she has achieved a peace of sorts with her native neighbors and with the natural world around her - a haunting, desolate land of brutal, bone-chilling winters and ever-present physical dangers.When two Easterners - a young man and his girlfriend - hire Bailey to pilot them into the bush, a series of events is set in motion that will upset the delicate racial balance of the land and lead to violence. As the truth behind the couple's arrival gradually becomes apparent, the cautiously constructed refuge Bailey has created for herself shatters. Forced to face the demons of her unresolved past - and the tragedy that brought her to Alaska, Bailey is given a chance to free herself at last from the secret that haunts her.",

        "Description": "Women's freedom and their freedom of movement have always advanced in tandem; early in this century, a suffragette's most potent symbol was her bicycle. Sports are central to American culture and the socialization of children, yet the \"manly\" sports world rarely offers women a level playing field.Despite laws to the contrary, all-male teams routinely garner a vastly disproportionate share of college athletic budgets; despite two decades of \"sensitivity,\" men's sports are still a fertile breeding ground for Neanderthal attitudes about women; and despite increased awareness of sexual harassment, affairs between male coaches and underage female players are commonplace and gang rape of college women by male athletes has almost become a cliche. As women have become increasingly involved in sports, those \"manly\" American sports - football, basketball, hockey - have seen an enormous explosion in popularity, at least partly because they are seen as an inviolably male domain.Many women are finding that participation in sports can make them healthier, happier, more confident in their own abilities, more at home in their own skins, better able to compete with men in the workplace. Is this what men are fleeing when they watch football? Astute, provocative, and full of original research, Mariah Burton Nelson's book paves the way for a new awareness of the American culture of sports and its pervasive effects on both women and men.",

And the nightmare perpetuated on Scarpetta's doorstep continues as she discovers that the so-called Werewolf murders may have extended to New York City and into the darkest corners of her past. When a formidable prosecutor, a female assistant district attorney from New York, is brought into the case, Scarpetta must struggle to make what she knows to be the truth prevail against mounting and unnerving evidence to the contrary. Tested in every way, she turns inward to ask, Where do you go when there is nowhere left? The answer is the Last Precinct. By the end of the novel, it is clear that Scarpetta's life can never be the same.",

        "Authors": "By Peterson, Peter G.",
        "Description": "According to recent polls, more young Americans believe in UFOs than think they will ever receive a Social Security check. Yet most Baby Boomers, as they approach retirement age, believe they will continue to live their present lifestyle in retirement - without a fraction of the personal savings or pensions necessary to pay for the future they expect.When the 76 million members of the Baby Boom generation - the largest generation in our history - begin to retire in less than fifteen years, one American in five will be 65 years of age or older. This aging population - double today's load - will depend on as few as 1.6 working Americans to support each retired person. Who will support this nation of Floridas?In this short, powerful book, Peter G. Peterson, one of America's top investment bankers and a leading critic of our entitlement policy, spells out in the clearest possible language, with unmistakable numbers and easy-to-read charts, the disaster that lies ahead if we continue to ignore our low savings rate, our ballooning federal deficit, and our enormous unfunded and unsustainable commitments to retirees. Peterson reveals what politicians are afraid to admit: trillions of dollars of promised Social Security and Medicare benefits for which no funds have been provided.Shattering the myths surrounding this subject with hard facts and eye-opening views of the future, Peterson gives the most comprehensive and candid plan for a gradual, humane, fair, and realistic answer to the greatest challenge of the next century: transforming our political, economic, cultural, and social assumptions to adapt to the realities of the graying of America.",

Flip through this book and you'll find the uncompromising style that has made Schildt's programming books the choice of millions of readers worldwide. Schildt distills his vast programming knowledge and teaching experience using concise instructions, succinct explanations, and page after page of practical examples and skill-sharpening exercises. You won't waste time wading through a sea of unnecessary material of needless digressions. Instead, you'll be writing C++ programs by the end of the first chapter and programming like a pro by the time you finish this book.Teach Yourself C++ is based on short, carefully structured lessons. Schildt begins every lesson with a description of a C++ programming principle, moves on to examples showing that principle in action and ends with exercises that reinforce what you've learned. The lessons are arranged sequentially so that each one builds upon the last and prepares you for the next. And because every chapter begins and end with a skills check, you always know when you need a review, or when it's time to advance.Dive into these lessons and immerse yourself in C++. You'll learn about the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes and objects, constructor and destructor functions, function and operator overloading, virtual functions, inheritance, C++'s object-oriented I/O system, templates, exception handling, references and much, much more.Whether you program for DOS, Windows, Unix, or any other operating system - and regardless of the compiler you use - Teach Yourself C++, Second Edition is the best book you can buy to learn C++.",

In this poignant debut novel, Susannah Keating uncovers a complex web of family secrets to reach the comforting conclusion that mothers, fathers, and daughters are profoundly and permanently connected no matter what befalls them.Fresh from school, Patrizia Orman, twenty-two, works as a gallery assistant in SoHo and is dreaming of success in the art world, when her mother, Lizzie, is killed in an automobile accident. Patrizia returns home for the funeral and her emotional shock is compounded when her godmother, Sarah, presents her with a cache of letters from her father -- a man she has never known, and of whom her mother has rarely spoken. Her godmother reveals that Masimilliano Caracci had been her mother's great love, a charismatic art dealer she met when she studied in Rome. Sadly, their passionate love affair had disintegrated when Lizzie discovered she was with child, and Masi demanded that she choose between their relationship or the unborn child, whom he vowed to neither acknowledge nor support.Hurt and confused by the revelations but longing to know the truth, Patrizia travels to Rome to find her father and weaves her way into his life while pretending she is merely Anna, another American art student. In Italy, Patrizia feels revitalized and indulges her artistic passion as well as her deepening interest in a young Italian named Andrea. As she experiences the treasures, tastes, and sounds of the ancient city, she dreams of living there indefinitely -- much like her mother did at the same age. But her unresolved relationship with her father threatens her happiness when Patrizia begins to fear that like her father before him, Andrea might also abandon her.Tender and heartfelt, Susannah Keating's vivid sensory descriptions and psychological honesty mark her as a touching storyteller and an astute observer of human nature. The Picture Book will have readers carefully examining their own lives and the choices they have made.",

Nolan's birth injuries left him quadriplegic and completely unable to communicate, so for years no one suspected that his mind, though imprisoned in an inert body, was burning to express his innermost thoughts and ideas to not only his family but the world. Whether he is fighting with the authorities for the right to go to an ordinary school, or going on a \"normal\" vacation for the first time, Nolan's story has a touching, often breathtaking intensity. Nolan recounts his ultimate triumph of finally being able to share with others the insight and whimsy of his inner world, unlocking the inventive wordsmith and gifted storyteller within. The result is astonishingly lyrical, filled with powerful description, touching moments of triumph, sadness, and anger, and above all disarming wit.",

For on San Pedro, memory grows as thickly as cedar trees and the fields of ripe strawberries--memories of a charmed love affair between a white boy and the Japanese girl who grew up to become Kabuo's wife; memories of land desired, paid for, and lost. Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an entire community was sent into exile while its neighbors watched.\u00a0\u00a0Gripping, tragic, and densely atmospheric, Snow Falling on Cedars is a masterpiece of suspense-- one that leaves us shaken and changed.\"Haunting....

S. leadership in a war against terrorism. Newhouse poses important questions: Why didn't the Bush administration exploit this rare opportunity to stabilize the Middle East, and Southwest and Northeast Asia? How have the administration's truculent behavior, misguided actions, and inaction at critical moments undermined efforts to curb the production of weapons of mass destruction? Why have Bush and his cabinet laid down edicts that have served chiefly to upset and sharpen the insecurities of other nations, including some of our allies?Newhouse discusses the reasons why Pakistan is probably the most dangerous country in the world. He devotes attention to the threats posed by Iran and North Korea, and the administration's bungled, dangerously inept attention to them. Woven through with illuminating anecdotes and vivid portraits of the players - Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell, Blair, Chirac, Putin, and others - Imperial America is a brilliantly clear, timely, and powerfully thought-provoking expose of recent American foreign policy: how it has been made and perilously mishandled.",

Problem was, these stories, many of which found their way into the general social consciousness, reflected the way in which these men lived and saw their world: that is, the stories were sexist, discriminatory, unfair, culturally biased, and in general, demeaning to witches, animals, goblins, and fairies everywhere.Finally, after centuries of these abusive tales, which have been handed down - unknowingly - from one male-biased generation to the next, James Finn Garner has taken it upon himself (that's right, yet another man) to enlighten and liberate these classic bedtime stories and retell them in a way that is much more in keeping with the society in which we live today.Politically Correct Bedtime Stores, then is the fruit of Garner's labors. We'd like to think that future generations of fairy-tale fans will see this as a worthy attempt to develop meaningful literature that is totally free from bias and purged from the influences of a flawed cultural past.",

Secrets of a Sparrow, her inspirational and intimate memoir, which takes its title from a favorite spiritual her mother sang to her, focuses on just that: the pain and pleasure of getting to number one and staying there, along with the lessons learned and the lessons taught.Diana Ross's onstage electricity and allure are here transposed to the page. With earthiness and humor, the lady looks back - and she isn't singing the blues. On the contrary, she's writing in a clear, confident voice about the life she's worked so hard to build - the early struggle followed by supreme success, the two marriages and five children, the Oscar nomination and countless music honors, the brilliant business acumen.Secrets of a Sparrow gives us the three-dimensional self-portrait of a glamorous woman who prizes her role as wife and mother every bit as much as her spectacular career, to whom love is right up there with fame. Always true to herself, Diana Ross is the ultimate entertainer, aiming to please but never compromise - and she's not about to start now.Elegantly designed and filled with memorable photographs - many never seen before - Secrets of a Sparrow is as stunning as Diana Ross herself.",

        "Description": "In these 30 essays, Roger Rosenblatt draws on his 27 years of reporting and commenting on America to reaffirm the core values of our complex and wonderful country. Famous for his ability to put wise and important ideas into witty and instructive prose, the prize-winning journalist and commentator provides comfort and resolve for Americans in a time of threat. With his charm and humor, Rosenblatt reminds us of the fundamental political and moral strengths of America. During the last 30 years, Rosenblatt believes, we have been living outside history in a bubble of wealth and power. The events of September 11, 2001, have given us a chance to reacquaint ourselves with what the country stands for and what it should become. If we have lost our way as a country, it is because we have lost sight of the idealism on which America was founded. The fundamentals of American justice and society are more than America's virtues\u2014they are standards by which a civilization measures its worth.",

        "Description": "When Catherine Meyer took her two young sons to the airport in the summer of 1994, she had no idea what a tragic turn life was about to take. Little did she know that from that day on, she and her children would never be free to talk, to cuddle, to laugh - and to love. After all, she was not sending her sons far, to some unknown and dangerous land, but to Germany, to see their father on summer holiday.But Alexander and Constantin, then ages 9 and 7, would never return from Germany. In violation of a custody agreement and in deliberate defiance of both British and German courts, Catherine's ex-husband kept the boys and cruelly deprived her of any access to them. Astonishingly, his illegal action was eventually supported by the German courts on the grounds that the boys wished to remain in Germany, and that they had been suffering in the \"foreign environment\" of London, England.They Are My Children, Too is Catherine Meyer's powerful account of a mother's ultimate nightmare: suddenly, without warning, to lose her children - and to find that neither the police, nor governments, nor the courts, can help her get them back. Finally, They Are My Children, Too is the inspiring tale of a woman discovering her own strength, as Catherine's personal tragedy becomes her political commitment; and as she finds the courage to love again.",
