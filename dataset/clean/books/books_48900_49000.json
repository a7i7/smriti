My Dog's The World's Best Dog is a valentine to dogs and dog people everywhere, full of whimsy and affection. Page after page captures a knowing moment in the relationship between people and dogs. Wylie, subject of the book, is Every Dog, and why is she the world's best dog? Count the ways: \"There's not a mean bone in her body.\" \"She knows when I'm coming-and gives the best greetings, even if I've only been gone for 45 seconds.\" \"My dog loves my cat-which is not to say that the reverse is true. But that doesn't seem to bother her much. Come to think of it, nothing does.\" Selection of the Literary Guild. 117,000 copies in print.",

But that's just what happens to millionaire media mogul Raymond Neenan. On a flight into Chicago's O'Hare airport, a man who looks a lot like Bulls superstar Michael Jordan appears in the seat beside him with a contract and these words of admonishment: \"The scenario says you don't have much longer to live. You'd better straighten out the mess you've made of your life.\" In fact, the \"man\" is the Archangel Michael.A cynic who's used to playing hardball in the business world, Neenan isn't too interested in his soul or anyone else's - unless there is money in it - and he's not buying this angel bit. A little well-timed turbulence that sends the plane hurtling earthward causes him to reconsider. If he doesn't believe in it, what could it hurt to sign?Though Neenan never knew it, he's damaged a lot of lives, including his own. He's hated or feared by his parents, his ex-wife, his children, and practically everyone he's ever met. But with Michael as his mentor, he just might be able to help some of the people he's ruined and discover that he actually enjoys it - and that maybe there's hope for that soul of his, after all.",

Yet, when First Parish asks her to cater the church's restoration campaign kickoff at historic Ballou House, she gamely agrees. She's never done a Murder Mystery Game benefit dinner before, and there's the additional draw of four famous local mystery writers to join in the fun. But the evening's merriment is brought to a grisly halt when a beautiful young woman dies moments after finishing every last bite of the dessert Faith has prepared!Now Faith is in serious trouble. Her phone is ringing off the hook with job cancellations, and Aleford's wagging tongues are suggesting that it was Faith herself who laced the goodie with cyanide, having discovered her husband Tom's perhaps overly pastoral interest in the victim. Then young Ben Fairchild's elementary-school principal reveals that he's been receiving anonymous threatening phone calls. Faith's world feels steeped in poison and the one person she'd normally turn to for comfort and advice seems locked in his own private hell. Tom is barely speaking to her.Never before has Faith's amateur sleuthing hit so close to home -- and never before has it been more crucial. She has to find out who killed Gwen Lord to save her business, her marriage, and possibly her freedom. But before she does, there's a body in the moonlight -- a body that carries an unmistakable warning for Faith Fairchild....You're next!",

        "Description": "\"We will live more and more in a world looking westward, and we stand poised on the verge of what will truly be a 'Pacific century,'\" says Frank Gibney, the author of this masterly study of the history and political development of the Asia-Pacific countries. A definable image of the Pacific Basin would include, on the eastern shore of the ocean, the principal states of North America - Canada, the United States, and Mexico. On the western shore we have China, Japan, Russian Asia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, both South and North Korea, Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos included), and the ASEAN group - Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, and Brunei. Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific islands round out the list.Lavishly illustrated, with hundreds of black-and-white and color photographs, The Pacific Century traces the past one hundred and fifty years of the Pacific Basin region, from colonialism to nationalism, from military clashes to economic ones. The book also examines in depth the future of the Pacific Basin - its social problems, pollution, population growth, trade friction, and immigration - as well as the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific nations. As the author notes, \"Our Pacific interconnections mark our common destiny.\"",

        "Authors": "By Rosenblatt, Roger (EDT)",
        "Description": "Consider this paradox: Ecologists estimate that it would take three planets Earth to provide an American standard of living to the entire world. Yet it is that standard of living to which the whole world aspires.In Consuming Desires, award-winning writer and social commentator Roger Rosenblatt brings together a brilliant collection of thinkers and writers to shed light on the triumphs and tragedies of that disturbing paradox. The book represents a captivating salon, offering a rich and varied dialogue on the underlying roots of consumer culture and its pervasive impact on ourselves and the world around us. Each author offers a unique perspective, their layers of thoughts and insights building together to create a striking, multifaceted picture of our society and culture.Jane Smiley probes the roots of consumerism in the emancipation of women from household drudgery afforded by labor-saving devices and technological innovation; Alex Kotlowitz describes the mutual reinforcement of fashion trends as poor inner-city kids and rich suburban kids strive to imitate each other; Bill McKibben discusses the significance, and the irony, of defining yourself not by what you buy, but by what you don't buy.The essays range widely, but two ideas are central to nearly all of them: that consumption is driven by yearning and desire -- often unspoken, seemingly insatiable -- and that what prevents us from keeping our consumptive impulse in check is the western concept of self, the solitary and restless self, entitled to all it can pay for.As Rosenblatt explains in his insightful introduction: \"Individualism and desire are what makes us great and what makes us small. Freedom is our dream and our enemy. The essays touch on these paradoxes, and while all are too nuanced and graceful to preach easy reform, they give an idea of what reform means, where it is possible, and, in some cases, where it may not be as desirable as it appears.\"",

On one day in 1729 he published the first edition of the Pennsylvania Gazette; on another day he changed the Declaration of Independence by adding the famous words, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident\"; and it was all in a day's work when he planted the first willow trees in America.  Modeled on his own Poor Richard's Almanack, this unique scrapbook captures Franklin's countless accomplishments. Biography and anecdote, cartoon and etching mesh to create a fascinating portrait of this most fascinating man. Anyone interested in the birth of American democracy...or curious about the rise of the U.S. postal system...or wondering how paper money came to be...or wanting to know how Ben Franklin was part of it all, is sure to pore over Ben Franklin's Almanac.",

        "Description": "What business entrepreneurs are to the economy, social entrepreneurs are to social change. They are, writes David Bornstein, the driven, creative individuals who question the status quo, exploit new opportunities, refuse to give up--and remake the world for the better.      How to Change the World tells the fascinating stories of these remarkable individuals--many in the United States, others in countries from Brazil to Hungary--providing an In Search of Excellence for the nonprofit sector. In America, one man, J.B. Schramm, has helped thousands of low-income high school students get into college. In South Africa, one woman, Veronica Khosa, developed a home-based care model for AIDS patients that changed government health policy. In Brazil, Fabio Rosa helped bring electricity to hundreds of thousands of remote rural residents.  Another American, James Grant, is credited with saving 25 million lives by leading and 'marketing' a global campaign for immunization. Yet another, Bill Drayton, created a pioneering foundation, Ashoka, that has funded and supported these social entrepreneurs and over a thousand like them, leveraging the power of their ideas across the globe.       These extraordinary stories highlight a massive transformation that is going largely unreported by the media: Around the world, the fastest-growing segment of society is the nonprofit sector, as millions of ordinary people--social entrepreneurs--are increasingly stepping in to solve the problems where governments and bureaucracies have failed. How to Change the World shows, as its title suggests, that with determination and innovation, even a single person can make a surprising difference.  For anyone seeking to make a positive mark on the world, this will be both an inspiring read and an invaluable handbook.",

Naturally, this would create a wealth of cherished culinary traditions. The authentic Veneto kitchen merges its ancient heritage with humble ingredients, producing one of the most fascinating cuisines in Italy. Julia della Croce shares the origins of over 60 recipes as she takes the reader on a glorious visual and culinary tour of the Veneto. Belluno's pillow-shaped pasta stuffed with beets and sprinkled with poppyseeds reveals Austrian influences, while a meal of roasted turkey topped with pomegranate sauce is a sure indicator that it's time to celebrate the fall harvest. Handy lists of charming places to stay, local festivals and cooking classes, plus evocative photos of the food and countryside will inspire anyone to plan their next vacation to the Veneto. Until then, this beloved region is as close as the kitchen.",

        "Description": "The greatest and most important of the Anglo-Saxon epic poems, the 1200-year-old Beowulf is one of the earliest pieces of literature in the English language. Though in English, the story is set in Scandinavia, where the Anglo-Saxon races lived before migration to England. It tells of the hero, Beowulf, who kills the monster Grendel after the dragonlike beast terrorizes the mead-halls, carrying off and eating the Thanes that are under Beowulf's protection. Fascinating for its story, the echoes of myth and early religion, Beowulf is critical reading for anyone interested in the blend of the Pagan and Christian traditions among the Anglo-Saxons. This edition is a readable prose translation.",

Big pictures--three shots of each of his thirteen friends, one of their heads, one of their middles, and one of their feet. But a mischievous witch tossed them in the air and now they are all mixed-up. Children will enjoy fixing up Phineas's mix-up by matching all three parts of each fancifully-clad animal. To help them find the perfect matches, there are small witch figures on the left-hand pages. When matching witch figures are aligned in a vertical row the animal on the facing page is correctly assembled. Turning the split pages to make silly combinations--more than 2000 possibilities--adds to the fun.",
