Monica Lewinsky.American history is marked by era-defining misdeeds, indiscretions, and the kind of tabloid-ready scandals that politicians seem to do better than anyone else. Now, for the first time, one volume brings together 300 years of political wrongdoing in an illustrated history of politicians gone wild\u2014proving that today\u2019s scoundrels aren\u2019t the first, worst, and surely won\u2019t be the last\u2026.From high crimes to misdemeanors to moments of licentiousness and larceny, this unique compendium captures in complete, colorful detail the foibles, failings, peccadilloes, dirty tricks, and astounding blunders committed by politicians behaving badly. Amid stories of brawlers, plagiarists, sexual predators, tax evaders, and the temporarily insane, this almanac tells all about:\u2022The only (so far!) president to be arrested while in office: Ulysses S. Grant, who was allegedly issued a ticket for racing his horse and buggy through the streets of Washington, D.C. \u2022The former New Jersey state senator David J. Friedland, who disappeared during a scuba diving accident in 1985. It turns out he staged the accident and served nine years in prison after being captured in the Maldives. \u2022Tape-recorded instructions from highbrow president Franklin Delano Roosevelt on how his staff should carry out some low-down political tricks\u2022The bizarre story of U.S. congressman Robert Potter, who castrated two men he suspected of having affairs with his wife. Potter won election to the state house while in jail\u2014but was kicked out for cheating at cards.\u2022Texas congressman Henry Barbosa Gonzalez: he was charged with assault in 1986 after he shoved and hit a man who called him a communist. Gonzalez was seventy years old at the time. At once shocking and hilariously funny, here\u2019s a book that exposes the history of American politics, warts and all\u2014and makes for hours of jaw-dropping, fascinating, illuminating reading.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Companion to World War II",
        "Authors": "By Dear, Ian (EDT) and Foot, M. R. D. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Despite Korea, despite Vietnam, despite a dozen smaller conflicts, a generation of Americans refers to World War II simply as \"the War.\" Indeed, there has been nothing like it in human history: a single war that spanned three continents--a war which saw more men and women under arms, more deaths, and more destruction than any other. Now Oxford University Press provides the definitive one-volume reference to this cataclysmic event. The Oxford Companion to World War II brings together an international team of 140 experts to cover every aspect of the conduct and experience of the conflict, from grand strategic decisionmaking to the struggles of daily life. More than 1,700 entries--ranging from brief identifications to in-depth articles on complex subjects--bring the far-flung elements and events of the war into focus. Here are essays on overarching themes and broad topics, such as the origins of the war, diplomacy, the Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere, and the Final Solution. Military campaigns and battles, of course, receive extensive attention: entries include the Fall of France, Operation Barbarossa, and the Battle of Midway, as well as such smaller events as the sinking of the Scharnhorst and the fall of Wake Island. Scores of analytical biographies range from the national leaders--Hitler, Stalin, Tojo, Roosevelt, Churchill--to an array of military and political figures, from Dietrich Bonhoeffer to Ho Chi Minh, from Marshal Timoshenko to General von Manstein. World War II was also an era of technological leaps, covert exploits, and horrific atrocities--and the Companion gives thorough coverage to each, with articles on weapons ranging from tanks to E-boats to rockets, on intelligence organizations (ranging from the O.S.S. to Smersh), and on the German Einstatzgruppen and Todt organization. The Companion also provides exceptional coverage beyond the military and political spheres, revealing the war as it affected the millions of noncombatants. In addition to exploring the economics and social policies of belligerent states, the Companion addresses such topics as children--explaining how hundreds of thousands were evacuated from threatened cities, thrown into combat, killed by bombing raids, or made into orphans. Indeed, the Companion's emphasis on the social history and daily experience of the war makes it the most complete one-volume reference on this critical chapter in history. In addition to thousands of entries, conveniently arranged in an a-to-z format, the book also features hundreds of maps, charts, tables, and evocative photographs. There is no finer resource on the war that shaped the modern world.  Features * More than 1,750 entries ranging from brief identifications to in-depth articles * More than 140 leading international experts have contributed, including David Kennedy, Martin Gilbert, Robert Dallek, Yogi Akashi, Ben-Ami Shillony, Heinz-Dietrich Lowe, Norman Davies, Wilhelm Diest, and many more * Massively illustrated with more than 100 evocative photographs and supplemented by 100 maps, thirty diagrams, and over 170 tables, charts and graphs * Articles on every aspect of the war, including: --surveys of countries, from economics to politics to military structure --portraits of wartime leaders, including generals, admirals, political figures, and heads of state--military campaigns and battles, from the Doolittle Raid to Operation Overlord, from Kassarine Pass to the Warsaw Uprising --intelligence organizations and exploits, from the Abwehr to Smersh, from codebreaking to commando raids --military technology, ranging from submarines to aircraft carriers, from fighter planes to V-1 and V-2 missiles, from the Enigma machine to radar * In-depth coverage of the social aspects of the war, such as the role of women, children, war production, and life under occupation",

Since then, the \"Kirkpatrick Model\" has become the most widely used approach to training evaluation in the corporate, government, and academic worlds. Evaluating Training Programs provided the first comprehensive guide to Kirkpatrick&apos;s Four Level Model, along with detailed case studies of how the model is being used successfully in a wide range of programs and institutions. This new edition includes revisions and updates of the existing material plus new case studies that show the four-level model in action. Going beyond just using simple reaction questionnaires to rate training programs, Kirkpatrick&apos;s model focuses on four areas for a more comprehensive approach to evaluation: Evaluating Reaction, Evaluating Learning, Evaluating Behavior, and Evaluating Results. Evaluating Training Programs is a how-to book, designed for practitiners in the training field who plan, implement, and evaluate training programs. The author supplements principles and guidelines with numerous sample survey forms for each step of the process. For those who have planned and conducted many programs, as well as those who are new to the training and development field, this book is a handy reference guide that provides a practical and proven model for increasing training effectiveness through evaluation. In the third edition of this classic bestseller, Kirkpatrick offers new forms and procedures for evaluating at all levels and several additional chapters about using balanced scorecards and \"Managing Change Effectively.\" He also includes twelve new case studies from organizations that have been evaluated using one or more of the four levels--Caterpillar, Defense Acquisition University, Microsoft, IBM, Toyota, Nextel, The Regence Group, Denison University, and Pollack Learning Alliance.",

Combining idealism and pragmatism, and with full respect for the original document, Larry Sabato's thought-provoking ideas range from the length of the president's term in office and the number and terms of Supreme Court justices to the vagaries of the antiquated Electoral College, and a compelling call for universal national service-all laced through with the history behind each proposal and the potential impact on the lives of ordinary people. Aware that such changes won't happen easily, but that the original Framers fully expected the Constitution to be regularly revised, Sabato urges us to engage in the debate and discussion his ideas will surely engender.

        "Description": "A Blueprint for Developing Tomorrow's School LeadersBased on two years of research supported by Carnegie Corporation of New York, The Broad Foundation, and the New Schools Venture Fund, The Principal Challenge focuses directly on the causes and cures of the crisis in school leadership. Marc Tucker, Judy Codding, and a stellar list of experts from the United States and abroad paint a revealing portrait of what it means to be a principal now, how and why most graduate schools of education have failed to provide the training principals need, what the military and business sectors do to create and support their leaders and managers, what the state of the art in professional training looks like, what other nations are doing to address this problem, and how to apply the very best practices in the world to solve the crisis in school leadership.This book is honest and hard-hitting. And it offers realistic solutions. Based on the thorough analysis provided by the chapter authors, the editors of The Principal Challenge offer an imaginative proposal for a new kind of institution that will train school principals to be turn-around artists. Drawing on the new forms of executive development programs in our business schools, they propose a similar program for school principals. The approach involves a close collaboration between the new institution and entire school districts, combining face-to-face instruction with web-based delivery. The innovative curriculum they describe, like the best approaches in business and industry, uses carefully developed cases, simulations, games, action projects, seminars and journaling, The editors offer a clear conception of what it might mean to be an instructional leader, a way of thinking about what it takes for a principal to be a strategic thinker, an approach that principals can use to take advantage of the best current thinking on knowledge management and professional development, a conception of the principal as school designer, an emphasis on the use of data to drive planning, and a host of tested ideas that principals can use to lead their schools to better results.",

The chapter on the breed\u2019s characteristics focuses on owner suitability, describing the GSD\u2019s physical and mental traits, versatility, agility, and requirements.  The breed standard is presented in the third chapter, giving the readers a clear view of how the ideal GSD should look, act, and move.New owners will welcome the well-prepared chapter on finding a reputable breeder and selecting a healthy, sound puppy. Chapters on puppy-proofing the home and yard, purchasing the right supplies for the puppy as well as house-training, feeding, and grooming are illustrated with photographs of handsome adults and puppies. In all, there are over 135 full-color photographs in this useful and reliable volume. The author\u2019s advice on obedience training will help the reader better mold and train into the most well-mannered dog in the neighborhood.

When a person knows Christ personally and consistently obeys the principles of Scripture, he is prepared for success God's way.\" ?Franklin Graham, Chairman and CEO, Samaritan's Purse; CEO, Billy Graham evangelistic Association\"In a society that increasingly judges the success of individuals by the clothes they wear, the car they drive, the club they belong to, or the career they choose, the church desperately needs to reaffirm biblical standards. Once again, Dr. Stanley has brought clear focus to a timely issue. Success God's Way challenges readers to reexamine whether or not they are sacrificing genuine, lasting success on the altar of a worldly, temporary counterfeit and therefore sesttling for a lot less than what God wants to give them.\" ?Anne Graham Lotz, International Bible Teacher and Bestselling Author\"In an age when our thinking is skewed, our zeal is waning, and our desire for excellence is deadened by apathetic self-centeredness, this book presents many biblical insights that challenge us to hear God's Word to Joshua to meditate on God's Word and be strong and courageous so we can have success.\" ?Kay Arthur, Precept Ministries International",

Who has not read about\u2014or experienced\u2014with a sinking feeling the fear that someone else out there may be using your credit cards, accessing your bank account, even stealing your identity. In I ll Walk Alone, Alexandra \u201cZan\u201d Moreland, a gifted, beautiful interior designer on the threshold of a successful Manhattan career, is terrified to discover that somebody is not only using her credit cards and manipulating her financial accounts to bankrupt her and destroy her reputation, but may also be impersonating her in a scheme that may involve the much more brutal crimes of kidnapping and murder. Zan is already haunted by the disappearance of her own son, Matthew, kidnapped in broad daylight two years ago in Central Park\u2014a tragedy that has left her torn between hope and despair. Now, on what would be Matthew\u2019s fifth birthday, photos surface that seem to show Zan kidnapping her own child, followed by a chain of events that suggests somebody\u2014but who? Zan asks herself desperately, and why?\u2014has stolen her identity. Hounded by the press, under investigation by the police, attacked by both her angry ex-husband and a vindictive business rival, Zan, wracked by fear and pain and sustained only by her belief, which nobody else shares, that Matthew is still alive, sets out to discover who is behind this cruel hoax. What she does not realize is that with every step she takes toward the truth, she is putting herself\u2014 and those she loves most\u2014in mortal danger from the person who has ingeniously plotted out her destruction. Even Zan\u2019s supporters, who include Alvirah Meehan, the lottery winner and amateur detective, and Father Aiden O\u2019Brien, who thinks that Zan may have confessed to him a secret he cannot reveal, believe she may have kidnapped little Matthew. Zan herself begins to doubt her own sanity, until, in the kind of fast-paced explosive ending that is Mary Higgins Clark\u2019s trademark, the pieces of the puzzle fall into place with an unexpected and shocking revelation. Deeply satisfying, I\u2019ll Walk Alone is Mary Higgins Clark at the top of her form.",

He looks at the elements of live performance - from the star singers and producers to the chorus and orchestra - before taking a unique look behind the scenes at an opera house, following the preparations for an opera through rehearsals and set-building to the opening night.The heart of the book explores eight of the world's best-loved operas, including Mozart's action-packed Don Giovanni, Bizet's sensuous Carmen, and Puccini's impassioned Tosca. A key song from each opera is featured on the CD and analyzed moment-by-moment on an annotated \"timeline,\" while the text discusses the musical and dramatic importance of the opera as a whole and looks at other celebrated operas by the same composer. With a listeners' guide to a further fifty essential operas, Opera: A New Way of Listening provides everything you need to know to enjoy the drama and beauty of this rich art.",
