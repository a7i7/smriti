Yet even as the champagne is chilling and the happy guests begin arriving on Broward's Rock Island, Annie feels a niggling sense of doom. But the last thing she or her guests expect is that the scheduled fun and mayhem will include a real-life murder. The unexpected arrival of Neil Bledsoe, the most despised book critic in America, was sure to raise a few hackles. An advocate of hard-boiled detection and gory true crime, Bledsoe drops a bombshell on the devoted Christie assemblage: He's penning a scurrilous biography of the grand dame of suspense herself. Before the first title clue is solved, no less than two attempts are made on Bledsoe's life. Now Annie and her unflappable husband, Max Darling, find themselves trying to stop a murder in the making-only the first corpse isn't the one they're expecting. . .and it isn't the last.",

After hours of unexplained penance on his knees in the chapel, he has announced to his unwitting relatives that he has written a new will...bequeathing everything to his devoted butler, Hutchins. Not since the days of George III, when roguish Sir Rowland Gossinger was accused of stealing the queen's silver tea strainer, has such a scandal threatened the family honor. But worse is yet to come.For Hutchins is missing, and it soon becomes apparent that the only thing the distinguished butler will inherit is a place in the cemetery. Found head down in the principal fixture of the twelfth-century privy; he may have been the victim of foul play. And what could Hutchins have meant by his dying words, \"God save the Queen\"?To Flora, the deceased's sweet young granddaughter, Hutchins's death is a tragic loss. Raised by him in Gossinger Hall, she remembers her grandfather's dedication to the noble Gossingers - including Sir Henry's social-climbing wife - and all the stately legends he told her over the silver polish. Only a new life in London, and the kindness of Vivian Gossinger, nephew and former heir to Sir Henry, can ease her pain.Yet soon Gossinger Hall's history of treachery and intrigue - topped by the ongoing rift with the Royal Family regarding the long-lost tea strainer - casts its shadow over Flora. And suddenly she finds herself caught in a murderously tangled web, where even a familiar face could hide the heart of a cold-blooded killer.",

        "Title": "Diana's Boys: William and Harry and the Mother They Loved",
        "Authors": "By Andersen, Christopher P.",
        "Description": "That the beautiful, complicated Princess of Wales -- arguably the most celebrated woman of the twentieth century -- died so violently and so young was tragic. That she was a single mother leaving behind two emotionally vulnerable sons made Diana's death at thirty-six all the more heartbreaking.Four years after Diana's death, Prince William and his brother Prince Harry -- \"the heir and the spare,\" as Fleet Street dubbed them -- are the planet's two most -- photographed, written-about, and speculated-about young men. People everywhere feel an intense affection for Wills and Harry, and wonder if, without their mother to guide them, they are withering or flourishing in the House of Windsor.In this much-anticipated sequel to his New York Times #1 bestseller The Day Diana Died, Christopher Andersen draws on important sources -- many of whom have agreed to speak here for the first time -- to paint this sympathetic yet often startling portrait of William and Harry, and reveal how their mother remains a constant presence in their lives. Among the revelations:New details about the hours and days after they lost their mother, how they coped in the wake of the tragedy, and who William blames for the crash that killed Diana.How the young princes were caught in the crossfire of their parents' tempestuous, often brutal marriage, and what impact that continues to have on them as young men.The behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the Queen to mold her grandsons in the Windsor image, and to what extent she has succeeded or failed.Camilla's growing role in the boys' lives, her secret pledge to Charles's sons, and whether they would accept her as their stepmother.The disturbing influence of William's friends -- including rebellious, drug-abusing aristocrats -- and the Palace's fight to keep them from leading the future king astray.The undisclosed threats on the princes' lives and the recurring nightmare that still haunts William.Harry's story -- his hopes, dreams, and fears as he struggles with life in the shadow of his brother.The women in William's life and what he has confided he wants in a future queen.Diana's Boys is more than the first comprehensive biography of the world's two most celebrated royals. Just as Andersen's bestsellers Jack and Jackie, Jackie After Jack, and The Day John Died allowed us to once again experience Camelot, readers will relive the tender relationship between Diana and her spirited offspring. This is the story of a mother who died too young and the children who are her living legacy.",

Drawing from personal experience, Weaver urges us to embrace life with a renewed sense of vitality and purpose, along with the knowledge that getting older means good times lie ahead.",

With this novel, Benilde Little has created a stunning drama about the African American upper class. These thirtysomething urban sophisticates -- urbane men and elegantly hip women -- lead lives of immense privilege in which each possession and every investment is blue chip.  Abra Lewis Dixon is the envy of the fashionable, professional women of her well-heeled social circle. She leads a charmed life -- she has attended all the right schools, married very well, and enjoys every material comfort granted by her bourgeois existence. An executive in her own film production company, along with her best friend, Natasha Coleman, Abra is an ambassador from the world of perfection. It is only when her impeccable marriage turns suddenly shaky that Abra's insular utopia is left in pieces.  Like Good Hair's Alice Andrews, Abra and Natasha are as endearing as they are genuine, and their stories are familiar to all who have known the desolation of heartbreak and the redemption and joy of self-discovery. Benilde Little has again written a novel that will earn a claim on readers' hearts and a place in their memories for years to come.",

        "Description": "From the talented author of The Serpent's Gift, which The Washington Post called \"beautifully crafted and profoundly insightful...staggeringly accomplished,\" comes a richly textured novel about two estranged African-American sisters who reunite in a search to understand their father and their family history.  A note in the mail announcing, \"He's been alive. He died last week,\" summons painter Sunday Owens from Chicago to her native town. It has been five years since she has been back to see her sister, Delta, who has never left Salt County, where the local river routinely overflows its banks, taking bits and pieces of people's lives when the waters recede. But more draws her to their childhood home than a desire for reconciliation with Delta; Sunday returns to claim her story and to unearth the secrets that have shaped her since her father, Mercury, left his shoes by the river and disappeared before she was born.  Now nearing midlife, with their troubled mother and matriarchal grandmother, Nana, both buried, Sunday and Delta learn that Mercury did not commit suicide as believed; he had lived another life -- as someone other than their father. Looking for clues to their father's past, they comb through the accumulated mementos of their old house, trade stories and childhood memories, and talk to the few living Bread Ladies, a group of Nana's friends who convened weekly to gossip, to comfort, and to make bread. A new portrait of the Owens family -- and their town -- gradually emerges as Sunday and Delta grapple with why their father chose to abandon them. Meanwhile, they confront their own personal struggles and work to repair the tattered bonds of sisterhood.  A novel about how family can both heal and hurt, about how the past reaches out for you no matter where you are, Water Marked resonates with mesmerizing language and deep emotion. A true storyteller, Helen Elaine Lee here elegantly confirms the extraordinary promise of The Serpent's Gift.",

        "Title": "The Lopsided Ape: The Evolution of the Generative Mind",
        "Authors": "By Corballis, Michael C.",
        "Description": "How great is the evolutionary distance between humans and apes, and what is it that creates that gulf? Philosophers and scientists have debated the question for centuries, but Michael Corballis finds the mystery revealed in our right hands. For humans are the only primates who are predominantly right handed, a sign of the specialization of the left hemisphere of the brain for language. And that specialization, he tells us, makes a massive distance indeed, as he describes what exactly it means to be the lopsided ape.In The Lopsided Ape, Corballis takes us on a fascinating tour of the origins and implications of the specialization of the two halves of the brain--known as laterality--in human evolution. He begins by surveying current views of evolution, ranging from the molecular level--the role of viruses, for instance, in transporting genes between species--to the tremendous implications of such physical changes as walking on two feet. Walking upright freed our ancestors' arms for such things as tool-making and gesturing (a critical part of early language). Corballis argues that the evolution of the brain--and language--was intimately tied up with these changes: The proliferation of objects made by early hominids, in an increasingly artificial environment marked by social cooperation, demanded greater flexibility in communication and even in thinking itself. These evolutionary pressures spurred the development of laterality in the brain. He goes on to look at the structure of language, following the work of Noam Chomsky and others, showing how grammar allows us to create an infinite variety of messages. In examining communication between animals and attempts to teach apes and dolphins language, he demonstrates that only humans have this unlimited ability for expression--an ability that he traces back through hominid evolution. After this engrossing account of what we know about evolution, language, and the human brain, Corballis suggests that the left hemisphere has evolved a Generative Assembling Device, a biological mechanism that allows us to manipulate open-ended forms of representation and provides the basis for mathematics, reasoning, music, art, and play as well as language and manufacture. It is this device, he writes, that truly sets us off from the apes.Both a detailed account of human language and evolution and a convincing argument for a new view of the brain,The Lopsided Ape provides fascinating insight into our origins and the nature of human thought itself.",

        "Title": "Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals",
        "Authors": "By Bennett, William J.",
        "Description": "Today we see little public outrage about Bill Clinton's misconduct. With enormous skill, the president and his advisors have constructed a defensive wall built of bricks left over from Watergate: diversion, half-truth, equivocation, and sophistry. It is a wall that has remained unbreached. Until now.  In The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals, former cabinet secretary and bestselling author William J. Bennett dismantles the president's defenses, brick by evasive brick, and analyzes the meaning of the Clinton scandals: why they matter, what the public reaction to them means, and the social and political damage they have already inflicted on America. For, despite Bill Clinton's position in public opinion polls, the most persuasive public arguments made by the president's supporters wither under the clear light of moral reason and common sense. The Death of Outrage exposes the fallacious and demeaning logic that argues our economic well-being is the only important measure of presidential performance; torpedoes the deep but wholly unexamined respect for European sophistication about \"private matters\"; and explains why the president's troubles are not the result of a \"vast, right-wing conspiracy,\" but are the result of his own doings. The Death of Outrage shows  How the president's actions, far from being irrelevant to the conduct of his affairs, have severely restricted his ability to govern. The unprecedented recklessness of the Clinton administration in everything from influence peddling to sexual misconduct to alarming tactics of intimidation. How the president and his defenders have exploited the natural tolerance of the American people -- and made a mockery of the rule of law. Why the Clinton scandals -- from the Travel Office, to Filegate, to the Rose Law Firm billing records, to the Lewinsky Affair -- are neither a creation of the tabloid press, nor independent of one another.   Bill Bennett explains why presidential character matters; why allegations of sexual misconduct need to be taken seriously; why reasoned judgment is the mark of a healthy democracy; and why the ends don't justify the means.  Explosive and hard-hitting, powerful in its logic, carefully reasoned in its conclusions, The Death of Outrage is directed at a shameful chapter of American history. It is an urgent call for American citizens to repudiate the deep corruption of Bill Clinton, and the corrupting arguments made in his defense.",

        "Title": "Mercy of a Rude Stream",
        "Authors": "By Roth, Henry",
        "Description": "In 1934, Call It Sleep was published, a first novel by a promising twenty-eight-year-old writer by the name of Henry Roth. It was a brilliantly lyrical work that would later be regarded as one of the greatest American novels of this century. But in that dark Depression year, few had money for literature, and the book faded into oblivion, not to be fully roused from its hibernation until 1964, when Call It Sleep was hailed, in the words of Irving Howe, as \"one of the few genuinely distinguished novels written by a twentieth-century American.\" Although the book proceeded to sell millions of copies, both in the United States and around the world, Henry Roth, then a waterfowl farmer in Maine, remained silent, called by some a literary recluse, a man with no second novel in the offing.Sixty years after Call It Sleep's first appearance, the publication of Mercy of a Rude Stream is a celebratory event in the world of literature, the remarkable reappearance of a literary genius whose language we presumed had been lost, whose urban \"world of rooftops and flying kites, of journeys to the marvelous turning bridges over the Harlem River\" and \"the lofty El curving in a charcoal sweep\" we thought we would never glimpse again.In this first installment of Mercy of a Rude Stream, called \"A Star Shines Over Mt. Morris Park,\" the first of six volumes Roth has already finished, we follow the adventures of a boy named Ira Stigman, and his extended Jewish immigrant family, from the outbreak of World War I through the beginning of the 1920s. With Ira's maternal grandparents, Zaida and Baba Farb, and their nine children, Roth has created an intricate and moving family saga, with Ira always at its center, a young boy tossed on the torrential currents of rude streams issued forth from the uncertainties of early twentieth-century New York City. Alienated from the Jewish Lower East Side of his early childhood by distance and distrust, Ira finds himself alone in \"goyish\" Harlem, frequently battling other children, his father, and the violence of sexuality. His mother, Leah, trapped and crippled by her own isolation, tries as best she can to shield her sensitive son from the wrath of a rageful, frequently unemployed husband as well as the deceit of the outside world.As the novel progresses, we follow Ira from a seemingly naive boy of eight to a street-smart, precocious young man of fourteen, burdened not only by the onset of adolescence, but also by the cruelties of public school, poverty, and the pain of life in an alien neighborhood. While the narrative concerns itself primarily with the psychological maturation of Ira, Roth paints Ira's story against the backdrop of America in the teens and early 1920s, and he deals masterfully with such larger themes as Prohibition, anti-Semitism, racism, and cultural deracination, particularly in the final part of the work, set in the basement of the gourmet grocery store Park & Tilford, where the narration echoes both Dante and Joyce.Told in two voices, the first being the traditional narrator, the second that of the old \"Ira\" conversing with his computer, Ecclesias, about \"the fragments of his past,\" and searching for the writer's voice that had eluded him for nearly a half century, Mercy of a Rude Stream is that rare work of fiction that creates, through its style and narration, a new form of art. Indeed, the two juxtaposed voices, the one of the \"little boys swimming in a sea of glory,\" the other of one of those same boys \"in old age being rudely swept to sea,\" create the counterpoint, jarring yet oddly harmonious, that makes this work so original. As Henry Roth ponders his unsought role as one of the great American writers of the twentieth century, his words take on a profoundly deep resonance, for his is indeed the last voice of a generation that we thought was long gone.",

        "Title": "Babel Tower",
        "Authors": "By Byatt, A. S.",
        "Description": "At the heart of the novel are two law cases, twin strands of the Establishment's web, that shape the story: a painful divorce and custody suit and the prosecution of an \"obscene\" book. Frederica, the independent young heroine, is involved in both. She startled her intellectual circle of friends by marrying a young country squire, whose violent streak has now been turned against her. Fleeing to London with their young son, she gets a teaching job in an art school, where she is thrown into the thick of the new decade. Poets and painters are denying the value of the past, fostering dreams of the rebellion, which focus around a strange, charismatic figure - the near-naked, unkempt and smelly Jude Mason, with his flowing gray hair, a hippie before his time.We feel the growing unease, the undertones of sex and cruelty. The tension erupts over his novel Babbletower, set in a past revolutionary era, where a band of people retire to a castle to found an ideal community. In this book, as in the courtrooms, as in the art school's haphazard classes and on the committee set up to study \"the teaching of language,\" people function increasingly in groups. Many are obsessed with protecting the young, but the fashionable notion of the children as innocent and free slowly comes to seem wishful, and perilous.Babel Tower is the third, following The Virgin in the Garden and Still Life, of a planned quartet of novels set in different mid-century time frames. And so the personal and legal crises of Frederica mirror those of the age. This is the decade of the Beatles, the Death of God, the birth of computer languages. In Byatt's vision the presiding genius of the 1960s seems to be a blend of the Marquis de Sade and The Hobbit. The resulting confusion, charted with a brilliant imaginative sympathy, is as comic as it is threatening and bizarre.",

He shows how walking and stretching will satisfy all your exercise requirements throughout your life, and provides a gradual plan by which you can make brisk forty-five-minute walks and some simple stretches part of your weekly regimen.Dr. Weil recommends the addition of four antioxidant supplements - vitamins C and E, selenium, and mixed carotenes - to further protect your healing system.

There are a dozen additional programs that concentrate on the specific needs of pregnant women, senior citizens, overweight people, and those at risk for cancer, among others. And throughout the book, there are case histories and firsthand accounts that attest to the remarkable success of the plan.",

Growing up in luxury just downriver from the Taj Mahal, at fifteen the news of Pran's true parentage is revealed and he is tossed out into the street - a pariah and an outcast. Thus begins an extraordinary, near mythical journey of a young man who must invent himself to survive - not once, but many times.Imprisoned in a brothel and dressed in women's clothes, his sensuous beauty is exploited as he is made to become Rukhsana, a pawn in a game between colony and empire. To a depraved British major he becomes Clive, an object of desire taught to be a model English schoolboy. Escaping to Bombay he begins a double life as Robert, dutiful foster child to a Scottish missionary couple, and as Pretty Bobby, errand boy and sometime pimp to the tawdry women of the city's most notorious district. But as political unrest begins to stir, Pran finds himself in the company of a doomed Englishman - an orphan named Jonathan Bridgeman. Having learned quickly that perception is a ready substitute for reality, Pran soon finds himself on a ship with Bridgeman's passport. First in London, then at Oxford, the Impressionist hones his chameleon-like skills, making himself whoever and whatever he needs to be to obtain what he desires.",

They're Virginia liberals with a clan of close-knit friends - a bright, edgy, flirty, games-playing group, spinning like a Catherine wheel around Mike and Joss. But the sparks that fly between the two are getting hotter and more dangerous, as Joss' restlessness turns to impatience and then anger. When one of the group introduces them all to the woman he wants to marry, things suddenly explode - this new arrival and Joss fall passionately in love, and their whole world careens out of control.What ensues is tragicomedy, as Mike tries to allay his rage and misery by letting himself get sucked into a trial run for a seat in Congress. He wants to be a hero to someone; instead he becomes the unwitting star of a political farce. Meantime, Joss is struggling with her new life, and their two young daughters (who form a lovingly unmerciful Greek chorus commenting on the action) have to navigate a turmoil in which one parent is a public joke and the other a private scandal.",

Kennedy's dark ambitions for his children - even the last and least of them.His book focuses in particular on the extraordinary sixties, a decade that began in glory for the family with Jack's ascension to the presidency, and ended - after the murders of Jack and Bobby, the tragedy at Chappaquidick, and their father's death - with Teddy, the last brother, standing alone in the rubble of Camelot.While The Last Brother is both shocking and newsworthy, Teddy Kennedy emerges as a curiously tragic figure, the victim of his own family, forever \"the fat, awkward little boy\" who was ignored by his siblings, his father and his mother, then propelled, unwilling and unprepared, into the public limelight.Searing, yet strangely moving and even sympathetic, The Last Brother presents a detailed, tragic portrait of a man at war with himself, doomed to live in the giant shadow of his brothers, trapped in the glorious but hollow Kennedy myth, longing - but unable - to escape.",

        "Description": "\"It's all in your head.\" \"Learn to bear it.\" \"That drug will make you a junkie.\" For the more than seventy-five million Americans affected by chronic pain, these are fighting words. Despite extraordinary medical progress in recent years, millions of people, debilitated by the pain of incurable cancer, crippling arthritis, unremitting headaches, and a host of degenerative disorders, continue to suffer needlessly. Here, in their own words, are the stories of more than forty people whose lives are dictated by pain--patients, healthcare professionals, ethicists, social commentators, and scientists--shining a powerful searchlight on America's most misunderstood health problem. The Truth About Chronic Pain reveals that pain is often ignored or under-treated due to widespread beliefs that it is a sign of weakness or unfounded fears that properly administered painkillers will cause addiction. As bureaucrats, doctors, and pharmacists become combatants in the War on Drugs, people in pain too often become unforeseen casualties. The Truth About Chronic Pain provides what pain-sufferers need just as keenly as physical relief: the knowledge that they are not alone. The voices on these pages are an eloquent testament to individual courage and a powerful plea to medical institutions, political leaders, and insurance companies to implement effective solutions to the problem of pain.",

        "Title": "A Dangerous Fortune",
        "Authors": "By Follett, Ken",
        "Description": "In his extraordinary new novel, master storyteller Ken Follett weaves a breath-taking tale set amid the wealth and decadence of Victorian England.In 1866, tragedy strikes at the exclusive Windfield School. A young student drowns in a mysterious accident involving a small circle of boys. Among them are scrappy Hugh Pilaster; his older cousin Edward, the weak, dissolute heir to the Pilaster banking fortune; and Micky Miranda, the darkly handsome son of a brutal South American landowner. The drowning and its aftermath initiate a spiraling circle of treachery that will span three decades and entwine many lives...Caught in the maelstrom are Augusta Pilaster, the raven-haired matriarch, strong-willed and sly, ever plotting to advance herself or her spoiled son, Edward, and gain control of Pilasters, the mighty bank that bears their name...Solly Greenbourne, the rich Jewish heir to Greenbournes - the only bank to rival Pilasters in power and prestige - who must battle the dirty stain of anti-Semitism in a still-intolerant nation...Maise Robinson, the beautiful and daring slum girl determined to be rich...Micky Miranda, the sinister hanger-on orchestrating an alliance of blackmail and murder to finance his family's takeover of a nation's government - a move that could rock the very foundation of Britain's economy. Over them all hands the shadow of the old tragedy, which threatens to shatter lives with the disclosure of a long-buried secret.From the exclusive men's clubs and brothels that cater to every dark desire of London's upper classes to the dazzling ballrooms and mahogany-paneled suites of the manipulators of the world's wealth, Ken Follett conjures up a stunning array of contrasts. Spanning the years when the British Empire tightened its grip on faraway worlds and revolution begot a tide of violent change, A Dangerous Fortune portrays a family splintered by lust yet bound inexorably by a shared legacy; and brings us men and women swept toward a perilous climax where greed, fed by the shocking truth of a boy's death, must be stopped - or not just one man's dreams, but those of a nation, will die.",

        "Title": "Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate",
        "Authors": "By Woodward, Bob",
        "Description": "Twenty-five years ago, after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency, Gerald Ford promised a return to normalcy. \"My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,\" President Ford declared.  But it was not. The Watergate scandal, and the remedies against future abuses of power, would have an enduring impact on presidents and the country. In Shadow, Bob Woodward takes us deep into the administrations of Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton to describe how each discovered that the presidency was forever altered. With special emphasis on the human toll, Woodward shows the consequences of the new ethics laws, and the emboldened Congress and media. Powerful investigations increasingly stripped away the privacy and protections once expected by the nation's chief executive.  Using presidential documents, diaries, prosecutorial records and hundreds of interviews with firsthand witnesses, Woodward chronicles how all five men failed first to understand and then to manage the inquisitorial environment.  \"The mood was mean,\" Gerald Ford says. Woodward explains how Ford believed he had been offered a deal to pardon Nixon, then clumsily rejected it and later withheld all the details from Congress and the public, leaving lasting suspicions that compromised his years in the White House.  Jimmy Carter used Watergate to win an election, and then watched in bewilderment as the rules of strict accountability engulfed his budget director, Bert Lance, and challenged his own credibility. From his public pronouncements to the Iranian hostage crisis, Carter never found the decisive, healing style of leadership the first elected post-Watergate president had promised.  Woodward also provides the first behind-the-scenes account of how President Reagan and a special team of more than 60 attorneys and archivists beat Iran-contra. They turned the Reagan White House and United States intelligence agencies upside down investigating the president with orders to disclose any incriminating information they found. A fresh portrait of an engaged Reagan emerges as he realizes his presidency is in peril and attempts to prove his innocence.  In Shadow, a bitter and disoriented President Bush routinely pours out his anger at the permanent scandal culture to his personal diary as a dozen investigations touch some of those closest to him. At one point, Bush pounds a plastic mallet on his Oval Office desk because of the continuing investigation of Iran-contra Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh. \"Take that, Walsh!\" he shouts. \"I'd like to get rid of this guy.\" Woodward also reveals why Bush avoided telling one of the remaining secrets of the Gulf War.  The second half of Shadow focuses on President Clinton's scandals. Woodward shows how and why Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation became a state of permanent war with the Clintons. He reveals who Clinton really feared in the Paula Jones case, and the behind-the-scenes maneuvering and ruthless, cynical legal strategies to protect the Clintons. Shadow also describes how impeachment affected Clinton's war decisions and scarred his life, his marriage and his presidency. \"How can I go on?\" First Lady Hillary Clinton asked in 1996, when she was under scrutiny by Starr and the media, two years before the Lewinsky scandal broke. \"How can I?\"  Shadow is an authoritative, unsettling narrative of the modern, beleaguered presidency.",

        "Description": "Spiritual Parenting is a guide to the naturally intuitive and spiritual core of every child. It refutes the current notions of the basic nature of children and teenagers, while offering a radically new way to approach parenting. In the words of authors, counselors, and ministers Hugh and Gayle Prather, \"This book reflects our deep personal conviction that parenting is a spiritual path, a form of worship.\" In their characteristically warm style, the Prathers offer a book of principles that parents can use to understand and protect their children at home, at school, and in the world. While one does not have to believe in God to understand these principles, say the Prathers, parents must approach child care as a spiritual task. They offer ways to keep this essential focus amid the bewildering complexities involved in guiding children toward adulthood.With joy and a sense of humor, the Prathers offer stories and anecdotes about their own children and the children of families they have counseled to help today's parents break through conflicting ideas and emotions and learn to enjoy their children at all stages of their growth.",

In this vibrant and penetrating book, we learn why so many bad things happen to the good people who work in the White House:Howard Paster gave up his cushy lobbyist lifestyle to fulfill a lifelong dream of ushering a president's legislative agenda through Congress. After too many close votes, sleepless nights, and stress-related rashes, Paster quit.Paul Begala and Jeff Eller thought they would find new and persuasive ways to communicate Clinton's message. It didn't happen. They survived two years.Dee Dee Myers thought she could make a difference among the sober white males in the West Wing, but she discovered that in the White House, women still have secondary status.Gene Sperling and Bruce Reed represented the two warring sides of Bill Clinton's political soul. But it's hard to enact any policy in a madhouse, especially one that's been undermined by a Republican revolution.",

        "Title": "Nightline:: History in the Making and the Making of Television",
        "Authors": "By Koppel, Ted and Gibson, Kyle",
        "Description": "Nightline: History in the Making and the Making of Television tells the inside story of a news broadcast that stands alone in its class: how shrewd network news executives turned a late-night byway into a major news thoroughfare, challenging both the hegemony of Johnny Carson and the conventional wisdom that television was no place for serious discussion of weighty issues; how a tireless band of producers, infatuated with the potential of new satellite technology, daringly used it as a new tool in the art of journalism and, frequently, international relations; and how, as politicians and newsmakers slowly began to realize the power of this idiosyncratic program, they attempted to make it a tool of their own.In this entertaining and revealing book, Ted Koppel and Kyle Gibson, a former Nightline producer, bring the reader backstage and back through history. Readers will find behind-the-scenes stories of the remarkable ingenuity that Nightline producers deployed to cover breaking events, a clear explanation of how new technological tools like satellites and portable videotape cameras changed the news business, and the rules of the cat-and-mouse games that journalists and newsmakers play.The book also reveals how this innovative program occasionally helped alter world events. The story of Nightline is the story of people and events that have defined the past decade and a half. From its origins in the Iran hostage crisis to the end of apartheid in South Africa, the fall of the Marcos regime in the Philippines, and the continuing story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Nightline has been our eyes and ears on history. It has helped us get to know such pivotal figures as Nelson Mandela, Yassir Arafat, and Bill Clinton, as well as rogues like Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Imelda Marcos, and Oliver North.Drawn from more than 120 interviews with Nightline staff members and guests, plus Koppel's own reminiscences, Nightline: History in the Making and the Making of Television is an insider's guide to one of the most memorable programs ever broadcast and a vivid record of cornerstone events in contemporary history.",

        "Authors": "By Johnson, Haynes",
        "Description": "\"I would like people to say I restored possibility in American life.\" This was President Bill Clinton aboard Air Force One, in a private interview at the end of Haynes Johnson's journey through an America torn by divisions and apprehensive of the future.For his first book since the prophetic best-selling Sleepwalking Through History, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist interviewed grassroots Americans from New England to the Sunbelt, from the heartland to the West Coast. Over nearly two years Johnson listened as businessmen, judges, youth gang members, new citizens and illegal aliens, students and farmers, teachers and lawmen expressed their deepest hopes and fears. The same major concerns kept surfacing: about jobs, crime, race, schools and services, values and leadership - and about life for the next generation. By contrasting the aspirations of people across the country with the inner workings of Washington during Bill Clinton's volatile first year as president, Divided We Fall illuminates a critical test of the American character.The result is an unforgettable portrait of a people disconnected from their government, yearning for change but acutely aware of the hard choices facing us as we prepare for the twenty-first century. Yet, shining through these personal narratives is the conviction that America is still the \"best country,\" one that can - and will - prevail despite its flaws and fragmentation. In a brilliant document that frames the problems confronting us and explores America's opportunities in the 1990s, Johnson urges us to join together, face the challenge of change, and take the brave gamble to reclaim the American Dream.",

Her revelation prompted appearances on Oprah and Dateline NBC, and she began to receive letters, calls, and E-mail from hundreds of women who told of their own experiences and were desperate for more information. They, too, were going through a loss of libido and were glad to know they were not alone.When Ferrare went to her doctor, she found that a lack of testosterone in her body was a key reason for her lack of interest in sex, and the doctor prescribed a testosterone cream that put her back in the mood - and thrilled her husband. But spurred by her approaching menopause, she wanted to find out for herself how hormone levels affect everything in our bodies - and how everything we do and eat affects our hormone levels. Ferrare came to the conclusion that a natural approach to balancing her hormones made sense for her. Now Ferrare offers a frank, funny, informative, and inspiring personal account of what she went through - and what she learned along the way.",

One night, on a dare, they drive to a blighted part of Washington to buy a little marijuana. But it isn't their night, and the deal goes terribly wrong. Before it's over, a shot is fired, and the two just barely get away, leaving a small-time drug dealer lying wounded in the street.Their troubles are only beginning.

Finding themselves suspects in a bizarre homicide, the two are forced to flee, leaving their families terrified and confused. And what started out as a relatively innocent moment of adolescent mischief soon turns into a nightmarish, life-threatening ordeal, one that eventually draws these sheltered teenagers into a citywide scheme of murders and cover-ups that may involve some of Washington's most prominent - and most trusted - public officials.",
