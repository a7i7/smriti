He begins teaching again, embarks on an affair with a married woman from the old neighborhood and becomes a mentor to a former student recently released from jail.Then, disaster: he is found beaten nearly to death in his own apartment. He knows who did it, but he\u2019s not talking, and he refuses to press charges.It is up to Detective Nerese Ammons\u2014a childhood acquaintance from the projects\u2014to get Ray to tell her what happened.Alternating between investigations of the people in Ray\u2019s life most likely to do him harm and listening to his fevered ramblings about their shared past as he slips in and out of consciousness, Nerese is charged not only with uncovering the perpetrator of this assault but with understanding what kind of victim is more afraid of the truth than of his potential murderer.The Washington Post Book World has hailed Richard Price as having \u201cthe best equipment a novelist can have\u2014that combination of muscularity, insight and compassion we might call heart.\u201d Samaritan is an electrifying story of crime and punishment, of character and place, of children and their keepers\u2014a novel of literary suspense that explores what happens when, caught up in the drama of one\u2019s own generosity, too little is given, too little is understood and the results threaten to prove both tragic and deadly.",

        "Authors": "By Stewart, James B.",
        "Description": "Young, blond, handsome Dr. Swango seemed a godsend wherever he was hired to practice medicine. But acclaim would turn to disbelief, dismay, then horror, as the evidence mounted that he could actually be murdering his patients. Then, Dr. Michael Swango would leave that hospital -- only to be rehired at another. Today the FBI believes that Swango may be the most prolific serial killer in American history.  In his brilliant, bestselling Den of Thieves, James Stewart exposed crime on Wall Street in the Roaring Eighties. Now, in Blind Eye, he takes readers into the closed world of America's medical establishment, where doctors repeatedly accept the word of fellow physicians over that of nurses, hospital workers and patients -- even after the horrible truth emerges.  With prodigious investigative reporting, Stewart's mesmerizing account moves from the hospital rooms of the prestigious Ohio State University Hospitals to Illinois, South Dakota, New York and finally to a remote missionary hospital in Zimbabwe. There Stewart tracked down survivors, relatives of victims, shaken hospital workers -- and the evidence that may finally lead Swango to be charged with murder. Stewart brings to riveting life the story of a psychopathic physician and those who protected, trusted, pursued and, in some cases, loved him. There were powerful doctors who allowed Swango to practice even following an incident in which a patient was paralyzed after a nurse saw him inject the patient's I.V. There were hospital officials who failed to collect crucial evidence, making it impossible for a prosecuting attorney to pursue Swango for murder. Another doctor admitted Swango to a medical residency when he knew that Swango had been convicted of poisoning coworkers. Stewart recounts the story of a New York woman who saw Swango inject her husband, after which he lapsed into a coma and died. An attractive, vivacious nurse fell in love with Dr. Swango, became his fianc\u00e9e, and may have learned too much about him. Blind Eye shows us the danger we face in a hospital system that too often puts appearances, reputation and potential liability ahead of patients' welfare -- and tells us what needs to be done to stop it. It exposes the alarming failure of a national policy that is supposed to monitor incompetence and misconduct in the medical profession, as well as the weakness of the federal legislation that is intended to protect the public.  Dr. Michael Swango slipped easily through the cracks. Hospital doctors, often strangers when we meet them, are the people who will care for us and our loved ones. If Michael Swango could repeatedly slip through, who else has? James Stewart adds to his reputation as one of the country's most intrepid investigative reporters with this exposure of a dangerous doctor and a failed system.",

        "Description": "Captain Bligh and the voyage of the Bounty are the starting point of this new study of the famous mutiny in history, literature and film. By juxtaposing an account of the mutiny with an analysis of its evolving place in history and culture, Mr. Bligh's Bad Language offers a new interpretation of the mutiny in the context of its historical and cultural representations.Beginning with an analysis of naval life and ritual aboard the Bounty, Greg Dening argues that the famous mutiny did not take place due to punitive violence, as Captain Bligh is shown to be one of the least violent of British Navy captains. Instead, he argues, Captain Bligh misunderstood the theatrical nature of shipboard life, especially his role as captain.Moving to a larger stage, the scope of the book shifts to the reception of the mutiny in England in the eighteenth century. Connecting the voyage of the Bounty with the cultural exploration and revolutions of the age, Greg Dening shows that a mythology arose almost immediately around the participants of the mutiny and their actions, a mythology that has been continually reinterpreted into twentieth century literature and film.Gracefully written, Mr. Bligh's Bad Language is an anthropological history of a new order, weaving the history of the Bounty with its role in our culture. Using a range of influences from Diderot to Foucault, Greg Dening reconstructs the voyage of the Bounty as moving between history and mythology, circumventing a dozen discourses.",

Very soon, she brought the fruits of her working years to Eatng Well! When you Just Can't Eat the Way You Used To. Its collection of 250 luscious recipes counsels vegetables and more vegetables, less meat, more fish and chicken, wines instead of hard liquor, light desserts. It's filled with information on keeping weight off, keeping restricted diets interesting, and keeping digestive tracks happy. More, it's packed with professional secrets for shopping wisely, and it's crammed with tips on planning ahead, sharing work, and using the freezer to save time. Readers are encouraged to share the feasts with friends as often as possible, perhaps serving a quick-preparation one-dish couscous, cassoulet, or chickadillo for as little as $3.00 per person. There are luncheons and high teas, dinners that begin as cocktail buffets but function as full meals, and more-elegant cold suppers, picnics, special celebrations. A Russian Brunch of fresh strawberries, blinis, walnut crescents, and tea in a glass is only the start: Eating Well goes on and on, the spilling cornucopia of a wonderful harvest.

Her four-times-a-week column in Washington's Evening Star was obligatory reading in Powertown, both for the nuggets that told the mighty who said what to whom and where, and for the scoops that made headlines all over America.Her legendary closeness to First Families and other top newsmakers is still the envy of hard-news journalists.\"I don't like talking to reporters, but I'll talk to her,\" Chief Justice Warren Burger told Betty at a party thrown in her honor by Clare Booth Luce. And Time magazine \"easily the best society columnist in town, and in the country.\"Now here, at last, are the memoirs of Betty Beale - lively; candid, generous, opinionated, glamorous, intimate, entertaining, and revealing.In Power at Play she takes you to glittering evenings at the White House; shares her love affair with one of the nation's most respected politicians, and her friendships with the most fascinating men and women of the era; invites you to her at-home dinners for presidents and their wives; reveals her feuds with White House staffers through the years; takes you inside royal palaces and billionaires' hideaways; and illuminates the private side of the most public, and most powerful, people in the world.Only Betty Beale could have written Power at Play. A consummate insider, she was weaned on politics and politesse in Washington as the granddaughter of a Tennessee congressman long before becoming the pace-setting writer who hit 500 power parties a year. Her life story, her early-blooming career and feminist grit, and her happy role as socialite wife and hostess is delightful, inspiring - and an awful lot of fun.Not since Dolly Madison has a woman watched Power at Play so intimately - or earned such a unique, close-up view of Washington from the top down, and from the inside out.",

Soros believes that this administration's plans abroad come from the same sort of \"bubble\" psychology that afflicted our markets in the late 1990s. They have used a real fact, our overwhelming military supremacy, to create a deluded worldview, that might makes right and that \"you're either with us or against us,\" in the same way that the recent boom used a real fact, the growth in technology, to lead to a delusion, the \"new economy.\" Like the best of the books that have responded quickly to world events, The Bubble of American Supremacy has a clear, intriguing, comprehensive thesis that makes necessary, and compelling, order of our seemingly disordered world.",
