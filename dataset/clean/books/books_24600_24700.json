For years, Josh's parents referred to Maura only as \"the Catholic.\" How do Maura and Josh cope? Rebecca Grodin is the only child of two Holocaust survivors, haunted by the events that shaped her parents' lives. Her husband, Rick O'Neill, a Methodist of Irish-Italian descent, grew up in what he calls a \"casually anti-Semitic\" family. When he converts to Judaism, his relatives become even more alienated from him and his wife. In Strangers to the Tribe, Gabrielle Glaser introduces eleven interfaith couples, their families, and their dilemmas. These true stories, gleaned from scores of interviews with couples of all ages across America, show the many ways in which Jewish-and-Gentile couples are reconciling their household customs and holidays, learning to understand their in-laws, raising their children, and questioning their own religious loyalties.",

I know you are all Anatole St. Leger could ever want, Septimus had told her. And sensible Madeline had begun to dream. But, now that she has reached her strange destination, the dream is diffusing quickly in the shadow of the dark and ominous Castle Leger. Her husband is hardly the gentleman she had envisioned. He looks more like a fierce Celtic warrior, one whose wild, ebony hair and brusque manner hint of stranger, mysterious gifts.What unknown forces are at work at Castle Leger? Why do the servants and the villagers both respect and fear her husband? Anatole knows only too well the legacies that to him have been more curse than gift. But as Madeline embarks on an odyssey both otherworldly and undeniably real, she and her husband fall hopelessly in love - until she also sees the haunting vision of murder in the crystal of the St. Leger sword and vows never to let this dire portent come to pass. Then, into this hypnotic world, a sudden, terrifying enemy emerges to threaten both their lives.",

        "Description": "One of history\u2019s greatest women, celebrated by her contemporaries, descendants, and biographers, now comes to life in this mesmerizing new novel by bestselling author Pamela Kaufman.In 1137, fifteen-year-old Eleanor became Duchess of Aquitaine, a wealthy and powerful province in the south of France. Rich and influential in her own right, her tumultuous marriages thrust Eleanor into the political and cultural spotlight, where she would remain for more than half a century.  Still in her teens, young Eleanor of Aquitaine married Louis VII of France, a sickly religious fanatic so obsessed with fears of adultery that he kept his beautiful wife under lock and key, even forcing her to go on a long and dangerous crusade with him. But Eleanor was delighted by the freedom of the  crusader\u2019s life. Her handsome Aquitanian knights, her deeds on horseback, and her scandalous attire were the talk of Europe; it soon became clear that Louis\u2019s young wife was more than he could handle. A lifelong rebel, Eleanor would defy her husband and the Church, and eventually strong-arm the Pope into annulling her unhappy marriage.Once free of Louis, Eleanor thought to marry Baron Rancon, her childhood love, but found herself forced into another political marriage, this time with a younger and more dangerous husband\u2014Henry II of England, a ruthless soldier known throughout Europe as \u201cthe red star of malice.\u201d In Henry Eleanor found a man whose iron will and political cunning matched her own, but the marriage was a bitter and brutal one, which escalated into open warfare when Eleanor backed their sons in an armed rebellion against Henry. Vowing revenge, he imprisoned her for fifteen years, hoping she would die in obscurity. But Eleanor would not go quietly.  In prison, she wrote her memoir; this is Eleanor\u2019s book.",

        "Description": "In this mesmerizing novel of intrigue the author of The Assassini and The Wind Chill Factor takes us into a chilling world of desire, betrayal, and obsession to weave the story of individual destinies drawn violently into the vortex of history.London, 1940, an age of darkness and terror. Hitler's armies are marching across Europe and North Africa, crushing all in their path, and the fate of the British Empire - of Western civilization - hangs in the balance. Prime Minister Winston Churchill has set into motion a daring plan: a raid code-named Praetorian that will send a team of handpicked commandos into the desert to assassinate German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. It is a mission doomed to failure. And for two men - and the woman they both love - the debacle will exact a bitter and terrible toll.The friendship between Max Hood, hero of the empire who rode alongside T. E. Lawrence in Arabia, and the young American correspondent Rodger Godwin was forged in the 1920s in Paris - city of Hemingway, hot jazz, and free love. It was there that they both met a girl alluring beyond her years, Priscilla DewBrittain - Cilla - who by 1940 would be a star of the British screen, Max Hood's wife, and the secret love of Godwin's life. Now Hood has been chosen to command the attack on Rommel's headquarters, and Godwin has been offered an exclusive on the story. At Churchill's personal request, the American accepts an active role in the assassination of the Desert Fox. But the Nazis lie in ambush. The plan has been betrayed.Consumed by his desire for Cilla and his guilt over the outcome of Operation Praetorian, Godwin vows to track down the traitor and kill him. His search for revenge is driven by obsession, one that draws him into a labyrinth of political intrigue and private passions. Gradually Godwin begins to discover how little he really knew: the truth about Hood, about Cilla, about himself... about the secrets shared between one man and another and between a man and a woman... about the primal urges that move through history - sex, power, and violence.Brilliant in its insight and observation, abundant with real and unforgettable characters, Praetorian stands as an extraordinary achievement. It is a novel of courage, conscience, and ambition that penetrates the hearts and minds of men and women ravaged by war - and by love.",

When General Griffin North, a highly decorated African American icon, is killed in a suspicious plane crash, the special commission, led by renowned federal judge Simon Esterhaus, deems it a tragic accident caused by pilot error.  But Mollie Smith of the Criminal Investigation Division vows to keep the investigation alive -- single-handedly and on her own terms, if necessary. Certain the general was assassinated, and keenly aware that certain officials in high places would have stopped at nothing to keep a black man from a possible vice-presidential nomination, Mollie intensifies the pitch of her inquiry.  Then Mollie -- her investigation nearly complete -- is found murdered. Rachel Collins, Mollie's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and close friend, is left to follow the scent of conspiracy enveloping the dead. With the help of Mollie's brother, Logan, the head of the hermetically-sealed FBI team tracking domestic terrorists, Rachel comes head to head with the Engineer, an ingenious and ruthless killer whose sole goal is to cut short her inquiry -- and her life. For Rachel, this assassin becomes her only link to a conspiracy that is much more deadly and far-reaching than she thought possible. It becomes clear to Rachel that she is marked by a man whose mysterious resources and top-secret information continually help him to thwart her.  From its harrowing first scene to its conclusion, Last Rights is a masterfully crafted thriller spinning around an unforgettable heroine. Phillip Shelby once again demonstrates that he is among the great thriller writers in america today.",

An impoverished but proud office drone (\"I am the reigning queen of the Toshiba BD copy machine\") gets a makeover. A teenager is drugged by her fraudulent, sadistic orthodontist. On a five-hour flight to Cabo San Lucas, the author psychically bonds with a flight attendant. In this collection of 25 hilarious, anecdotal short stories, spoken-word performer Beth Lisick creates a panoramic tapestry of strip malls, junk-food habits, and yuppie pickup joints, unveiling a world that most of us simply drive past. Blending the everyday and its sometimes grotesque underside, hallucinatory detail, and stripped-down dialogue, Lisick's descriptions are almost hypnotic with their complex rhythms and cadences. These stories - all of which Beth Lisick uses in performance - imbue the ordinary with unique and unexpected hilarity. Striking, witty, and vividly contemporary, these stories evoke what it's like to live now, in the suburban wasteland of the '90s.",

Ireland's literary legacy has taken root in American soil, and this dazzling anthology captures the spirit of this Celtic renaissance.Motherland presents a poignant collection of Irish American women's writings about the mother-daughter bond in all its variety: sometimes a source of strength and solace, sometimes of sorrow and resentment, but always and everywhere central to the author's identity.Acclaimed anthologist Caledonia Kearns has collected more than twenty pieces of fiction and nonfiction to create a rich tapestry of emotion, humor, and truth, featuring the work of contemporary writers, such as Anna Quindlen, Mary Gordon, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Mary Cantwell, Martha Manning, Rosemary Mahoney, Susan Minot, and Maureen Howard, along with voices from past eras like Margaret Sanger, Mother Jones, and M.F.K. Fisher.This book speaks directly to the hearts of every mother and daughter.  Irish or not, readers will find treasures to cherish, wisdom to live by, and words that sing with the spirit of the Celtic soul.  It's a wonderful gift for St. Patrick's Day, Mother's Day, or any occasion when eloquence is the order of the day.",

It also means it's time to laugh uproariously, slap your forehead in astonishment at the absurdity of the world, and if you want to get angry on your own - either with Lewis or at him - well, that's all right too.What's gotten America's bestselling humorist so steamed? A little something he likes to call \"modern life.\" Times were a lot easier back in the days when Elvis was King and \"We Like Ike\" buttons were about as raunchy a public statement as anybody made. What's happened in the interim are things that Lewis just doesn't quite understand - and a lot of Americans don't quite get either.I Haven't Understood Anything Since 1962 is about ... well...it's about almost everything that's happened to America in the last thirty years - as seen through the eyes of someone who doesn't like what he sees. It's about George Bush and Pat Buchanan and David Duke. It's about liberals and racism and modern media. It's also about morality and values and history and movie stars \"runnin' around nekkid.\" It's about relationships and rednecks and blacks and women and homosexuality. It's as funny as anything Grizzard has ever written before, but it's also shocking and revealing and honest. A man who's made his reputation by speaking out now speaks out like he never has. A man who has probably outraged more people in this country than anyone since Dan Quayle's third grade spelling teacher now has written his most controversial book.You might not agree with Lewis Grizzard but you can't ignore him. He speaks not just for himself; he speaks for a lot of people who can't quite get over the state of the country and the shape the world is in. Whether you are laughing hysterically at what he says or pounding the table in fury, you'll have to agree that Lewis Grizzard is clearly a man who understands a lot more than he thinks he does.",

Naomi and Ruth, bound together as kin, are now each other's only comfort. Naomi lost her own husband, Eli, eight years ago, and now she has lost her son.Watching Ruth struggle through grief, Naomi suddenly realizes what she must do to make herself whole again: She must return to her childhood home in coastal South Carolina. There, she remembers, was the innocence of youth and first falling in love. But when she tells Ruth about her plan, she receives an unexpected reply: \"Where you go, I will go. Where you live, that's where I'll live too.\" So the two women plan the journey together.The only family Naomi has down South are in-laws, people she hasn't seen in decades, having kept in touch over the years only through annual Christmas cards. But when she phones, apprehensively, to tell them of her plan, they welcome her with openness and warmth. Arriving at a home full of sons and daughters and grandchildren, Naomi and Ruth are flooded with a love they are nearly too fragile to accept.Yet Naomi carries a deep secret in her soul - and not even this change of scenery can erase its dark shadow. As the long Southern days seep into their hearts, both she and Ruth begin to find themselves reawakened. And as the love of her newfound family and her enduring bond with Ruth prove themselves stronger than sin, stronger than heartache, redemption finds Naomi once and for all.",

        "Description": "When Ben Crenshaw sank his putt at the seventy-second hole for a one-shot victory in the 1995 Masters, he bent over, buried his face in his fingers for a moment, then wept in the arms of his caddie. This was Ben's way of telling the world that what he had just done was his own memorial to his great friend and mentor Harvey Penick, who had passed away almost exactly a week before. With Crenshaw's victory, every golfer, every lover of the game, joined Ben in giving thanks to the greatest golf teacher of all time.Harvey Penick's life in golf began when he started caddying at the Austin Country Club in Texas at the youthful age of eight. Over the next eighty-plus years, he enlightened the members of that club with insights into golf and life. In 1992, at the age of eighty-seven, he offered the world that same wisdom in a timeless collection of pieces entitled Harvey Penick's Little Red Book. He followed that with three more books, all bestsellers, and all filled with thoughts, stories, and golf advice that had stood the test of time. Now, Bud Shrake, Harvey's friend and collaborator, gathers together the very best pointers, portraits, and parables from all four of Harvey's previous works. Filled with nuggets of wisdom from Harvey Penick's Little Red Book, And If You Play Golf, You're My Friend, For All Who Love the Game, and The Game for a Lifetime and enhanced with dozens of personal photographs and keepsakes from the Penick family scrapbooks, The Wisdom of Harvey Penick is a lasting treasure from the most beloved teacher in all of golf.",

Written in the author's wry and masterful voice, these evocative stories are infused with all the peculiar customs, ironies and humor so special to the South. The twelve stories in this collection include \"Red Clay,\" which won an Edgar Allen Poe Award, in which a local girl from Thermopylae becomes a movie star who moves back to her sleepy North Carolina home town and is tried for murdering her unfaithful husband. Her trial causes the town and one man in particular to look back with longing and nostalgia at this exquisite Southern belle who captivated-and sometimes manipulated-every man she met.  \"Fast Love,\" the recipient of an O. Henry Award, is the story of a man who chases down his future wife after seeing her jog past. As he gets closer to his quarry, he also gains the courage to stand up for what he wants and to champion what he believes.In \"Blue Cadillac,\" Marie, blonde and beautiful, shares dinner and her love of Elvis with a high-tech sales rep on his way home to Memphis. Along the way and on the road, they have exquisite sex and decide to part, Marie in her blue Cadillac. As he rings the bell at his mother's house, the young man discovers that he has been robbed of his wallet and his whole life on cards.

First there were her acclaimed Victorian mysteries, sparkling with passion and suspense. Now readers have embraced this bestselling new series of World War I novels\u2013which juxtapose the tranquil life of the English countryside with the horrors of war.By April of 1915, as chaplain Joseph Reavley tends to the soldiers in his care, the nightmare of trench warfare is impartially cutting down England\u2019s youth. On one of his rescue forays into no-man\u2019s-land, Joseph finds the body of an arrogant war correspondent, Eldon Prentice. A nephew of the respected General Owen Cullingford, Prentice was despised for his prying attempts to elicit facts that would turn public opinion against the war. Most troublesome to Joseph, Prentice has been killed not by German fire but, apparently, by one of his own compatriots. What Englishman hated Prentice enough to kill him? Joseph is afraid he may know, and his sister, Judith, who is General Cullingford\u2019s driver and translator, harbors her own fearful suspicions.Meanwhile, Joseph and Judith\u2019s brother, Matthew, an intelligence officer in London, continues his quiet search for the sinister figure they call the Peacemaker, who, like Eldon Prentice, is trying to undermine the public support for the struggle\u2013and, as the Reavley family has good reason to believe, is in fact at the heart of a fantastic plot to reshape the entire world. An intimate of kings, the Peacemaker kills with impunity, and his dark shadow stretches from the peaceful country lanes of Cambridgeshire to the twin hells of Ypres and Gallipoli.In this mesmerizing series, Anne Perry has found a subject worthy of her gifts. Illuminating the murderous conflict whose violence still resounds in our consciousness\u2013as well as the souls of men and women who lived it\u2013Shoulder the Sky is a taut, inspiring masterpiece.",
