He demonstrates why this pandemic \u2013the worst in human history \u2013is beyond the scope of governments acting alone \u2014and how, even in the face of devastating global catastrophes, public-private partnerships can deliver real hope.

On the eve of the Inauguration the losing candidate presents proof of the crime to his opponent, the incumbent President, and demands that he stand aside. The winner refuses and takes the oath of office, thereby setting in motion what may destroy him and his party, and even bring down the Constitution.Washington's high-power world of enmity and friendship, loyalty and cunning, is rendered with a unique, behind-the-headlines realism that places the reader squarely inside our government. The riveting plot turns on the battle for power between two honorable but very different men, President Bedford Forrest \"Frosty\" Lockwood, the current occupant of the White House, and his supposedly defeated rival, former President Franklin Mallory.A remarkable cast of vivid characters, drawn with the sure but sympathetic hand that is McCarry's literary trademark, help decide the destiny of these two embattled men and the fate of the nation: the beautiful, brainy, and mysterious Zarah Christopher, who moves between the two Presidents and inspires the love of one of them; a rowdy but brilliant and adroit Speaker of the House; an ascetic, ideology-driven Chief Justice; an outcast journalist; a Machiavellian presidential assistant and his half brother from the shadowy world of espionage; a flamboyant trial lawyer and his canny investigator; an intriguing gallery of forceful women; and the members of an upper-crust secret society who seize on the constitutional crisis as an opportunity to \"cure\" the United States of its democratic weaknesses. Above all, out of this crowd of extraordinary men and women emerges one person of striking originality, power, and an all-too-human proclivity who will long remain in the reader's memory.",

        "Description": "At a time when Americans are turning to alternative forms of spiritual fulfillment, Rabbi Daniel Gordis finds what many are looking for in the context of a several-thousand-year-old religion.God Was Not in the Fire argues that Jewish life does merit serious attention. It is Judaism's insistence on asking life's most important questions (which helps us define precisely who and what we are) that enables it to play an enriching role in our lives. Because Judaism maintains that we feel God's presence through the experiences of daily life, the author takes us through the traditions of ritual, prayer, study, mitzvah, and ethics. Gordis illustrates that by developing a relationship with God through Judaism, one can achieve the heightened sense of self essential for finding connectedness, continuity, and, ultimately, transcendence and spirituality. It is not, Gordis argues, through blind faith that Jews come to understand the world and their place in it, but through \"spiritual discipline\" and a ceaseless round of investigations that a sense of belonging is attained.A why-to rather than a how-to, God Was Not in the Fire suggests that the religion of one's youth can deepen in adult life. It can give us, if we search to understand it, the most powerful way we know of expressing our humanity.",

        "Authors": "By Somers, Suzanne",
        "Description": "Getting older can be brutal\u2014women gain weight, lose their sex drive, experience hot flashes, suffer memory loss, become short-tempered, find it difficult to sleep, and on and on. It\u2019s not so easy for men, either\u2014they start to lose energy and stamina as they age, too (and they have to live with women going through menopause). After years of being thin and fit and full of energy, Suzanne herself encountered the \u201cSeven Dwarfs of Menopause\u201d\u2014Itchy, Bitchy, Sweaty, Sleepy, Bloated, Forgetful, and All-Dried-Up. Instead of living out the rest of her life cranky, sleep-deprived, and libido-less, Suzanne set out to discover how she could get her mind, body, and life back and banish those pesky dwarfs for good.The result is The Sexy Years: Discover the Hormone Connection\u2014The Secret to Fabulous Sex, Great Health,   and Vitality, for Women and Men. In this passionately argued and enormously practical book, Suzanne supports her own research and experiences with the expertise of leading doctors in the field of women\u2019s and men\u2019s health and sexuality to create an inspiring, accessible call-to-arms to women to radically rethink how they approach life after fifty, and give them the tools to turn their lives around. Suzanne has discovered that the second half of life has been more rewarding, fun, and purposeful than her younger years. The key to her happiness? Taking natural bioidentical hormones. Natural hormones, which mimic the hormones produced in our own bodies that are almost completely lost with aging, are the answer to the symptoms of menopause that plague women. Recent findings from the medical community show that synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be harmful to women\u2014thus, thousands of women are looking for what else they can do to alleviate their symptoms. In The Sexy Years, Suzanne comes to the rescue with a step-by-step plan and detailed information about how women can take control of their health, for themselves and for their men, including:\u2022 What the differences are between synthetic and bioidentical hormones, and why bioidentical hormones help women lose weight, reinvigorate their sex lives, and fight the symptoms of aging\u2022 How doctors do not receive adequate training about hormones and are slaves to the pharmaceutical industry, and what questions every woman must ask her physician about hormone replacement therapy and her health\u2022 How Suzanne turned her life around, with information about how often she visits her doctor, blood work, what hormones she takes, how to get these hormones, and more\u2022 What male menopause, or andropause, is and how men can also take bioidentical hormones and regain the energy they had in their youth\u2022 What a variety of specialists think about natural hormones, health, and sexuality\u2014Suzanne shares the best advice from these doctors and provides a resource list of physicians and pharmaciesWith bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, Suzanne has found the fountain of youth, the elixir that has made her feel thirty years old again. In combination with her Somersize diet and fitness plan, which she also writes about here, Suzanne has never felt better. The beauty of growing older, she maintains, is that you can combine the wisdom of age with the vitality of youth. Suzanne makes it perfectly clear how women and men can regain their zest for life at any age. These really are the sexy years!",

        "Description": "A devastating indictment of the Bush administration's war policies from the bestselling author and respected moral authority With the words \"this Crusade, this war on terror,\" George W. Bush defined the purpose of his presidency. And just as promptly, James Carroll-Boston Globe columnist, son of a general, former antiwar chaplain and activist, and recognized voice of ethical authority-began a week-by-week argument with the administration over its actions. In powerful, passionate bulletins, Carroll dissected the President's exploitation of the nation's fears, invocations of a Christian mission, and efforts to overturn America's traditional relations-with other nations and its own citizens. Crusade, the collection of Carroll's searing columns, offers a comprehensive and tough-minded critique of the war on terror. From Carroll's first rejection of \"war\" as the proper response to Osama bin Laden, to his prescient verdict of failure in Iraq, to his never-before-published analysis of the faith-based roots of current U.S. policies, this volume displays his rare insight and scope. Combining clear moral consciousness, an acute sense of history, and a real-world grasp of the unforgiving demands of politics, Crusade is a compelling call for the rescue of America's noblest traditions.A cry from the heart, a record of protest, and a permanently relevant analysis, Carroll's work confronts the Bush era and measures it against what America was meant to be.",

Now, take off on the extraordinarily fun and inspiring adventure of an ordinary woman who takes charge of her life by ending her disastrous marriage, losing fifty-five pounds, and getting fit -- and finds she has gained more than she ever dreamed possible!  Rosie Gardener and Vickie Winters were best friends, closer than sisters. Partners in a successful mail-order company, both women lived comfortably in lush Savannah, Georgia. Svelte and single Vickie only wanted the best for her friend -- and she couldn't stay quiet when Rosie, overweight and unable to see her own worth, fell under the spell of Kent Bliss, a two-timing cad whose meal ticket was vulnerable Rosie. The night before Rosie's wedding was the last time Vickie spoke to her -- to warn her about Kent's true nature, and to quit their business before leaving for Europe.  Now, on her third wedding anniversary, Rosie realizes Vickie was right -- and that the Porsche and other indulgences were her attempts to buy the love of a man who only cared about himself. Fed up with his mistreatment, she vows to change her life -- starting by kicking him out that night. The next day, she begins a diet and exercise regime. But more life-changing news awaits: Rosie has the single winning ticket in the Wonderball lottery -- and she's won $302 million.  With Kent lurking in the shadows to claim a share of her money, Rosie needs her friends more than ever -- and when Vickie returns to Savannah, Rosie learns the power of forgiveness. As she loses weight and works out under the eye of sexy personal trainer Jack Silver, a new Rosie emerges. This pretty woman is making a fresh start, and no one's greed or bitterness -- or even her own occasional self-doubts -- will stop her from jumping into life and love with a passion she didn't know she possessed.",

        "Description": "In this inimitable, beloved classic'graceful, lucid and lyrical'Anne Morrow Lindbergh shares her meditations on youth and age; love and marriage; peace, solitude and contentment as she set them down during a brief vacation by the sea. Drawing inspiration from the shells on the shore, Lindbergh's musings on the shape of a woman's life bring new understanding to both men and women at any stage of life. A mother of five, an acclaimed writer and a pioneering aviator, Lindbergh casts an unsentimental eye on the trappings of modernity that threaten to overwhelm us: the time-saving gadgets that complicate rather than simplify, the multiple commitments that take us from our families. And by recording her thoughts during a brief escape from everyday demands, she helps readers find a space for contemplation and creativity within their own lives. With great wisdom and insight Lindbergh describes the shifting shapes of relationships and marriage, presenting a vision of life as it is lived in an enduring and evolving partnership. A groundbreaking, best-selling work when it was originally published in 1955, Gift from the Sea continues to be discovered by new generations of readers. With a new introduction by Lindbergh's daughter Reeve, this fiftieth-anniversary edition will give those who are revisiting the book and those who are coming upon it for the first time fresh insight into the life of this remarkable woman. The sea and the beach are elements that have been woven throughout Anne Morrow Lindbergh's life. She spent her childhood summers with her family on a Maine island. After her marriage to Charles Lindbergh in 1929, she accompanied him on his survey flights around the North Atlantic to launch the first transoceanic airlines. The Lindberghs eventually established a permanent home on the Connecticut coast, where they lived quietly, wrote books and raised their family. After the children left home for lives of their own, the Lindberghs traveled extensively to Africa and the Pacific for environmental research. For\u00a0several years they lived on the island of Maui in Hawaii, where Charles Lindbergh died in 1974.\u00a0 Anne Morrow Lindbergh spent her final years in her Connecticut home, continuing her writing projects and enjoying visits from her children and grand-children. She died on February 7, 2001, at the age\u00a0of ninety-four. Reeve Lindbergh is the author of many books for both adults and children, including the memoirs Under a Wing and No More Words.",

She troubleshoots for her grown kids, cares for her live-in mother-in-law, Arthurine (and elderly poodle, Snuffy); keeps tabs on her girlfriends Paulette and Bunny and her own aging mother and foster sister\u2014all the while holding down a part-time job.

        "Description": "Almost 250 years ago the Starcruiser Argos reached the planet Destiny with a payload of interstellar pioneers. In the first tumultuous years on Destiny, two events changed forever the lives and futures of these colonists: the desertion of the Argos, an event that severed all hope of ever contacting Earth, and the disappearance of its fusion-powered landing craft, the Cavorite.For the settlers of Spiral Town, the largest known remaining colony, Cavorite is a name that conjures awe and wonder still, for its final voyage left behind a dominant and lasting mark on the planet's surface and a key to their survival: the Road.Wide and smooth, it was seared into a flow of molten lava by the fusion drive of the Cavorite as the landing craft hovered a meter above the planet's rocky surface. Some say the Road crosses the whole planet. Others are sure the Cavorite exploded or the crew was killed by undiscovered Destiny creatures. No settler who has gone down the Road has ever returned.For Jemmy Bloocher, a young farm boy, the questions burn too hot, he yearns to leave the mind-numbing work in his father's fields and follow the Road. The course of Jemmy's life is decided for him when he accidentally kills a caravan worker in a tavern fight. Leaving Spiral Town, he flees certain retribution, and his flight becomes a quest to discover what happened to the Cavorite and its crew - and uncover the many mysteries on Destiny's Road.",

Sherry Carrigan O'Toole can't seem to apply the prescriptions she offers in her bestselling self-help books to her own life. Six years after her marriage to Brandon disintegrated and he won custody of their son, Scott, there's no room in their lives for her. Hoping to win back the teenager's heart, Sherry arranges a week's skiing at the plush SkyTop Village resort.  But Scott has other plans. Determined to evade his mother's clutches, he jumps at the chance to join a foolhardy adventure: flying a Cessna through a nighttime storm to Salt Lake City for a Metallica concert. After the plane crashes, Scott is lost and alone in the frozen wilderness, miles from anywhere anyone would search for him.  As Brandon and Sherry revisit the old battles that tore them apart, they have to fight a bureaucracy that wants to abandon the search even as their son struggles to survive impossible odds.  Barely alive, Scott finally finds a cabin for shelter. He thinks his troubles are over. When he discovers the truth about the man who lives there, however, it's clear that his terror has hardly begun. With his latest page-turner, John Gilstrap cements his position among today's most ingenious thriller writers.",

        "Authors": "By Ambrose, Stephen E.",
        "Description": "From the bestselling author of Undaunted Courage and D-Day, the definitive book on the most important day of World War II, comes the inspiring story of the ordinary men of the U.S. Army in northwest Europe from the day after D-Day until the end of the bitterrest days of the war. Citizen Soldiers opens at 0001 hours, June 7, 1944, on the Normandy beaches, and ends at 0245 hours, May 7, 1945. In between come the battles in the hedgerows of Normandy, the breakout at St.-L&244, the Falaise Gap, Patton tearing through France, the liberation of Paris, the attempt to leap the Rhine in Operation Market-Garden, the near-miraculous German recovery, the battles around Metz and in the Hurtgen Forest, the Battle of the Bulge -- the biggest battle in the history of the U.S. Army -- the capture of the bridge at Remagen, and finally the overrunning of Germany. From the high command (including Eisenhower, Bradley. and Patton) on down to the enlisted men, Stephen E. Ambrose draws on hundreds of interviews and oral histories from men on both sides who were there. Ambrose once again recreates the experiences of the individuals who fought the battles. The women who served as nurses, secretaries, clerks, code-breakers, and flyers are part of the narrative, as are the Germans who fought against us. Within the chronological story, there are chapters on medics, nurses, and doctors; on the quartermasters; on replacements; on what it was like to spend a night on the front lines; on sad sacks, cowards, and criminals; on Christmas 1944; on weapons of all kinds. Ambrose reveals the learning process of a great army -- how to cross rivers, how to fight in snow or hedgerows, how to fight in cities, how to coordinate air and ground campaigns, how to fight in winter and on the defensive, how citizens become soldiers in the best army in the world. Ambrose evokes the suffering of warfare, fighting in the cold and wet, gruesome wounds, combat exhaustion, looting, shooting prisoners, random destruction and more. Throughout, the perspective is that of the enlisted men and junior officers. Even when writing about Ike, Monty, Patton, and Bradley, Ambrose does so from the point of view of the men in the front lines and focuses on how the decisions of the brass affected them. Citizen Soldiers is a biography of the U.S. Army in the European Theater of Operations, June 7, 1944, to May 7, 1945. Allied citizen soldiers overcame their fear and inexperience, the mistakes of the high command, and the enemy to win the war. Once again, Stephen E. Ambrose shows that free men fight better than slaves, that the sons of democracy proved to be better soldiers than the sons of Nazi Germany.",

        "Description": "When sixteen kids are shot on high school grounds, everyone looks for someone to blame. Meet Vernon Little, under arrest at the sheriff's office, a teenager wearing nothing but yesterday's underwear and his prized logo sneakers. Moments after the shooter, his best buddy, turns the gun on himself, Vernon is pinned as an accomplice. Out for revenge are the townspeople, the cable news networks, and Deputy Vaine Gurie, a woman whose zeal for the Pritikin diet is eclipsed only by her appetite for barbecued ribs from the Bar-B-Chew Barn. So Vernon does what any red-blooded American teenager would do; he takes off for Mexico.  Vernon God Little is a provocatively satirical, riotously funny look at violence, materialism, and the American media.",

The place is a seemingly peaceful Australian town on the banks of the Macleay River in New South Wales. Here Tim Shea has come from distant Ireland to build a new life free of the crippling poverty and bleak horizons of the past. But he finds that this land of opportunity is a land of perilous choices.

Lewis and Clark: Across the Divide also follows the explorers' steps by reconstructing the richly physical worlds of the expeditions. Gathered in this volume are 400 illustrations, the results of a five-year enterprise to trace and authenticate the original artifacts, documents, maps, and artworks of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Scattered for two hundred years, the surviving physical evidence is now reassembled from more than fifty lending institutions and individuals across the United States. The result is a new view of the equipment the expedition used as well as the color, complexity, and diversity of the cultures they encountered - items that gave the young Republic its first glimpse of what later became the cross-continental nation. A concluding essay weaves together contemporary tribal perspectives to summarize Native American experiences since Lewis and Clark's visit, mapping out a powerful - and hopeful - vision for the future.",

        "Description": "In the course of the twentieth century, no war looms as profoundly transformative or as destructive as World War II. Its global scope and human toll reveal the true face of modern, industrialized warfare. Now, for the first time, we have a comprehensive, single-volume account of how and why this global conflict evolved as it did. A War To Be Won is a unique and powerful operational history of the Second World War that tells the full story of battle on land, on sea, and in the air. Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett analyze the operations and tactics that defined the conduct of the war in both the European and Pacific Theaters. Moving between the war room and the battlefield, we see how strategies were crafted and revised, and how the multitudes of combat troops struggled to discharge their orders. The authors present incisive portraits of the military leaders, on both sides of the struggle, demonstrating the ambiguities they faced, the opportunities they took, and those they missed. Throughout, we see the relationship between the actual operations of the war and their political and moral implications.A War To Be Won is the culmination of decades of research by two of America's premier military historians. It avoids a celebratory view of the war but preserves a profound respect for the problems the Allies faced and overcame as well as a realistic assessment of the Axis accomplishments and failures. It is the essential military history of World War II--from the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to the surrender of Japan in 1945--for students, scholars, and general readers alike.",

        "Title": "Atonement: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By McEwan, Ian",
        "Description": "On the hottest day of the summer of 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis sees her older sister Cecilia strip off her clothes and plunge into the fountain in the garden of their country house. Watching Cecilia is their housekeeper\u2019s son Robbie Turner, a childhood friend who, along with Briony\u2019s sister, has recently graduated from Cambridge.By the end of that day the lives of all three will have been changed forever. Robbie and Cecilia will have crossed a boundary they had never before dared to approach and will have become victims of the younger girl\u2019s scheming imagination. And Briony will have committed a dreadful crime, the guilt for which will color her entire life.In each of his novels Ian McEwan has brilliantly drawn his reader into the intimate lives and situations of his characters. But never before has he worked with so large a canvas:  In Atonement he takes the reader from a manor house in England in 1935 to the retreat from Dunkirk in 1941; from the London\u2019s World War II military hospitals to a reunion of the Tallis clan in 1999.Atonement is Ian McEwan\u2019s finest achievement. Brilliant and utterly enthralling in its depiction of childhood, love and war, England and class, the novel is at its center a profound\u2013and profoundly moving\u2013exploration of shame and forgiveness and the difficulty of absolution.",

        "Description": "Set in a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood in 1947, this poignant tale revolves around two of the most endearing characters in recent fiction: an eleven-year-old Irish Catholic boy named Michael Devlin and Rabbi Judah Hirsch, a refugee from Prague. From their initial chance encounter in a swirling blizzard one Saturday morning to the mute awe they share at first setting eyes on the hallowed grounds of Ebbets Field, Hamill brings to life the richness and complexity of this most remarkable friendship. For Michael, the rabbi's stories of ancient magic and wisdom captivate his imagination and transport him to times and places even his beloved comic book heroes have never visited. For the rabbi, Michael's patient instruction on the language of baseball and American culture opens up an equally strange and magical world.",

        "Authors": "By James, P. D.",
        "Description": "The year is 2021, and the human race is - quite literally - coming to an end. Since 1995 no babies have been born, because in that year all males unexpectedly became infertile. Great Britain is ruled by a dictator, and the population is inexorably growing older. Theodore Faron, Oxford historian and, incidentally, cousin of the all-powerful Warden of England, watches in growing despair as society gradually crumbles around him, giving way to strange faiths and cruelties: prison camps, mass organized euthanasia, roving bands of thugs. Then, suddenly, Faron is drawn into the plans of an unlikely group of revolutionaries. His passivity is shattered, and the action begins.The Children of Men will surprise - and enthrall - P. D. James fans. Written with the same rich blend of keen characterization, narrative drive and suspense as her great detective stories, it engages powerfully with new themes: conflicts of loyalty and duty, the corruption of power, redemption through love. Ingenious, original, irresistibly readable, it confirms once again P. D. James's standing as a major novelist.",
