Members of a parallel humanity that evolved in Europe for hundreds of thousands of years, they were in direct competition with Cro-Magnons \u2014 modern humans. The way Neanderthals lived and the reasons why they disappeared 50,000 years ago offer a surprising mirror in which we can examine and learn more about ourselves.

        "Description": "Feasts, banquets, and grand dinners have always played a vital role in our lives. They oil the wheels of diplomacy, smooth the paths of the ambitious, and spread joy at family celebrations. They lift the spirits, involve all our senses and, at times, transport us to other fantastical worlds. Some feasts have give rise to hilarious misunderstandings, at others competitive elements take over. Some are purely for pleasure, some connect uncomfortably with death, but all are interesting. Nichola Fletcher has written a captivating history of feasts throughout the ages that includes the dramatic failures along with the dazzling successes. From a humble meal of potatoes provided by an angel, to the extravagance of the high medieval and Renaissance tables groaning with red deer and wild boar, to the exquisite refinement of the Japanese tea ceremony, Charlemagne\u2019s Tablecloth covers them all. In her gustatory exploration of history\u2019s great feasting tables, Fletcher also answers more than a few riddles such as \u201cWhy did Charlemagne use an asbestos tablecloth at his feasts?\u201d and \u201cWhere did the current craze for the elegant Japanese Kaiseki meal begin? Fletcher answers these questions and many more while inviting readers to a feasting table that extends all the way from Charlemagne\u2019s castle to her own millennium feast in Scotland. This is an eclectic collection of feasts from the flamboyant to the eccentric, the delicious to the disgusting, and sometimes just the touchingly ordinary. For anyone who has ever sat down at a banquet table and wondered, \u201cWhy?\u201d Nichola Fletcher provides the delicious answer in a book that is a feast all its own.",

        "Title": "The Moral Life: An Introductory Reader in Ethics and Literature",
        "Authors": "By Pojman, Louis P.",
        "Description": "Literature often deals with moral issues. It focuses on human dilemmas and awakens our imagination to new possibilities. It compels us to rethink and revise our everyday assumptions, enabling us to consider ethical questions in creative ways.        The Moral Life: An Introductory Reader in Ethics and Literature brings together an extensive and varied collection of 87 classical and contemporary readings on ethical theory and practice. The book is divided into four sections covering the nature of morality, moral theories, moral issues, and applied ethics. Integrating literature with philosophy in an innovative way, editor Louis Pojman uses literary works to enliven and make concrete the ethical theory or applied issues addressed in each chapter. Literary works by Hugo, Hawthorne, Melville, Tolstoy, Ibsen, Huxley, Orwell, Camus, LeGuin, Styron, and many others lead students into philosophical concepts and issues such as relativism, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, the meaning of life, freedom, sex, love and marriage, and environmental ethics. Once introduced, these topics are developed further through readings by philosophers including Aristotle, Sartre, Bernard Williams, Jane English, and Thomas E. Hill, Jr. This unique anthology emphasizes the personal dimension of ethics, which is often ignored or minimized in ethics texts.         Featuring insightful part and chapter introductions as well as biographical sketches, abstracts, and study questions for each reading selection, The Moral Life is ideal for introductory ethics courses. It also provides an engaging gateway into personal and social ethics for the general reader.",

        "Title": "The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast",
        "Authors": "By Brinkley, Douglas",
        "Description": "In the span of five violent hours on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed major Gulf Coast cities and flattened 150 miles of coastline. Yet those wind-torn hours represented only the first stage of the relentless triple tragedy that Katrina brought to the entire Gulf Coast, from Louisiana to Mississippi to Alabama.First came the hurricane, one of the three strongest ever to make landfall in the United States -- 150-mile-per-hour winds, with gusts measuring more than 180 miles per hour ripping buildings to pieces.Second, the storm-surge flooding, which submerged a half million homes, creating the largest domestic refugee crisis since the Civil War. Eighty percent of New Orleans was under water, as debris and sewage coursed through the streets, and whole towns in south-eastern Louisiana ceased to exist.And third, the human tragedy of government mis-management, which proved as cruel as the natural disaster itself. Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, implemented an evacuation plan that favored the rich and healthy. Kathleen Blanco, governor of Louisiana, dithered in the most important aspect of her job: providing leadership in a time of fear and confusion. Michael C. Brown, the FEMA director, seemed more concerned with his sartorial splendor than the specter of death and horror that was taking New Orleans into its grip.In The Great Deluge, bestselling author Douglas Brinkley, a New Orleans resident and professor of history at Tulane University, rips the story of Katrina apart and relates what the Category 3 hurricane was like from every point of view. The book finds the true heroes -- such as Coast Guard officer Jimmy Duckworth and hurricane jock Tony Zumbado.Throughout the book, Brinkley lets the Katrina survivors tell their own stories, masterly allowing them to record the nightmare that was Katrina. The Great Deluge investigates the failure of government at every level and breaks important new stories. Packed with interviews and original research, it traces the character flaws, inexperience, and ulterior motives that allowed the Katrina disaster to devastate the Gulf Coast.",

        "Description": "On average, a physician will interrupt a patient describing her symptoms within eighteen seconds. In that short time, many doctors decide on the likely diagnosis and best treatment. Often, decisions made this way are correct, but at crucial moments they can also be wrong -- with catastrophic consequences. In this myth-shattering book, Jerome Groopman pinpoints the forces and thought processes behind the decisions doctors make. Groopman explores why doctors err and shows when and how they can -- with our help -- avoid snap judgments, embrace uncertainty, communicate effectively, and deploy other skills that can profoundly impact our health. This book is the first to describe in detail the warning signs of erroneous medical thinking and reveal how new technologies may actually hinder accurate diagnoses. How Doctors Think offers direct, intelligent questions patients can ask their doctors to help them get back on track.Groopman draws on a wealth of research, extensive interviews with some of the country\u2019s best doctors, and his own experiences as a doctor and as a patient. He has learned many of the lessons in this book the hard way, from his own mistakes and from errors his doctors made in treating his own debilitating medical problems.How Doctors Think reveals a profound new view of twenty-first-century medical practice, giving doctors and patients the vital information they need to make better judgments together.",

Yet while there is a constancy in the history of the river, there is also change. The Thames charts the diverse meanings of the river over the course of millennia, from prehistoric to modern times. From the elephants on the bank of the prehistoric river to Caesar\u2019s expeditionary force; from King Alfred\u2019s battleships to the signing of Magna Carta; from the river\u2019s role in both the coronation and execution of Anne Boleyn to seventeenth-century frost fairs and the first performance of Handel\u2019s \u2018Water Music\u2019; from Turner\u2019s view of the river as arcadia through its bombardment during the Blitz, The Thames provides an intimate portrait of the waterway at the heart of English history.

        "Title": "The Gettysburg Gospel: The Lincoln Speech That Nobody Knows",
        "Authors": "By Boritt, Gabor",
        "Description": "The words Abraham Lincoln spoke at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg comprise perhaps the most famous speech in history. It has been quoted by popes, presidents, prime ministers, and revolutionaries around the world. From \"Four score and seven years ago...\" to \"government of the people, by the people, for the people,\" Lincoln's words echo in the American conscience. Many books have been written about the Gettysburg Address and yet, as Lincoln scholar Gabor Boritt shows, there is much that we don't know about the speech. In The Gettysburg Gospel he reconstructs what really happened in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on November 19, 1863. Boritt tears away a century of myths, lies, and legends to give us a clear understanding of the greatest American's greatest speech.In the aftermath of the bloodiest battle ever fought in North America, the little town of Gettysburg was engulfed in the worst man-made disaster in U.S. history: close to 21,000 wounded; very few doctors; heroic women coping in houses, barns, and churches turned into hospitals; dead horses and mules rotting in farmyards and fields; and at least 7,000 dead soldiers who had to be dug up, identified, and reburied. This was where Lincoln had to come to explain why the horror of war must continue.Planning America's first national cemetery revitalized the traumatized people of Gettysburg, but the dedication ceremonies overwhelmed the town. Lincoln was not certain until the last moment whether he could come. But he knew the significance of the occasion and wrote his remarks with care -- the first speech since his inauguration that he prepared before delivering it. A careful analysis of the Address and the public reaction to it form the center of this book. Boritt shows how Lincoln responded to the politics of the time and also clarifies which text he spoke from and how and when he wrote the various versions. Few people initially recognized the importance of the speech; it was frequently and, at times, hilariously misreported. But over the years the speech would grow into American scripture. It would acquire new and broader meanings. It would be better understood, but also misunderstood and misinterpreted to suit beliefs very different from Lincoln's.The Gettysburg Gospel is based on years of scholarship as well as a deep understanding of Lincoln and of Gettysburg itself. It draws on vital documents essential to appreciating Lincoln's great speech and its evolution into American gospel. This is an indispensable book for anyone interested in the Gettysburg Address, Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War, or American history.",

        "Authors": "By Kotz, Nick",
        "Description": "Opposites in almost every way, mortally suspicious of each other at first, Lyndon Baines Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr., were thrust together in the aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination. Both men sensed a historic opportunity and began a delicate dance of accommodation that moved them, and the entire nation, toward the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Drawing on a wealth of newly available sources -- Johnson's taped telephone conversations, voluminous FBI wiretap logs, previously secret communications between the FBI and the president -- Nick Kotz gives us a dramatic narrative, rich in dialogue, that presents this momentous period with thrilling immediacy. Judgment Days offers needed perspective on a presidency too often linked solely to the tragedy of Vietnam.We watch Johnson applying the arm-twisting tactics that made him a legend in the Senate, and we follow King as he keeps the pressure on in the South through protest and passive resistance. King's pragmatism and strategic leadership and Johnson's deeply held commitment to a just society shaped the character of their alliance. Kotz traces the inexorable convergence of their paths to an intense joint effort that made civil rights a legislative reality at last, despite FBI director J. Edgar Hoover's vicious whispering campaign to destroy King.Judgment Days also reveals how this spirit of teamwork disintegrated. The two leaders parted bitterly over King's opposition to the Vietnam War. In this first full account of the working relationship between Johnson and King, Kotz offers a detailed, surprising account that significantly enriches our understanding of both men and their time.",

        "Authors": "By Hall, Stephen S.",
        "Description": "An award-winning journalist tackles the hot topic of male body image and shows how physical size during childhood affects our psychology, social status, relationships, and income as adults. With a mix of fresh research, incisive reportage, and bracing candor, Size Matters traces the surprising history of society\u2019s bias against shortness and reveals how short people can and do thrive in spite of this insidious bigotry. Drawing on his own childhood experiences (he was shorter than 99 percent of boys his age), Stephen Hall explains the evolution of the growth chart, the biology of childhood aggression, and the wrenching phenomenon of bullying. He explores the factors that determine why one child\u2019s small stature may lead to anguish while another short child develops an emotional resilience that will enrich his later life. Weaving together recent findings from the fields of animal behavior, psychology, and evolutionary biology, Hall assesses the role of physical size in mating success and argues that the alpha male may not be king of the mountain after all. Hall also pinpoints the social forces that create and cash in on our anxieties about size, from bulked-up superhero action figures to pharmaceutical companies selling growth hormone to increase a child\u2019s height -- at a cost of up to $40,000 a year. He introduces us to families who have agonized over whether to make that huge investment. He explains new research showing that a person\u2019s height as a teenager has lifelong psychological consequences. He even tracks down kids he bullied in elementary school and kids who bullied him in high school to show that these childhood encounters have lasting effects on our adult lives. Along the way, Hall builds a persuasive case against societal attitudes that make size (or any difference) matter and argues forcefully that being short has psychological, social, and biological advantages. Size Matters will raise the consciousness -- and the spirits -- of any short male and anyone who cares about him.",

A Door Opens is an outgrowth of the two worlds Jack Wilde has inhabited for the past twelve years. First and foremost is the world of the public school classroom as a fifth grade language arts and social studies teacher. Second is the adult world of teacher education, specifically the New Hampshire Writing Program. These worlds complement each other: The public school teaching provides the experiences for him to reflect on and present in the summer writing program, and the writing program challenges him to consider and reflect on his classroom teaching.

        "Title": "God's Secret Agents: Queen Elizabeth's Forbidden Priests and the Hatching of the Gunpowder Plot",
        "Authors": "By Hogge, Alice",
        "Description": "One evening in 1588, just weeks after the defeat of the Spanish Armada, two young men landed in secret on a beach in Norfolk, England. They were Jesuit priests, Englishmen, and their aim was to achieve by force of argument what the Armada had failed to do by force of arms: return England to the Catholic Church.Eighteen years later their mission had been shattered by the actions of the Gunpowder Plotters -- a small group of terrorists who famously tried to destroy the Houses of Parliament -- for the Jesuits were accused of having designed \"that most horrid and hellish conspiracy.\" In an unusual turn of events, the future of every Catholic they had hoped to save would soon come to depend on the silence of one Oxford carpenter, a man being tortured in the Tower of London for building priest holes, those bunkers in which the Catholic clergy hid from English authorities.Using contemporary documents, Alice Hogge's brilliant new book pieces together a deadly game of cat-and-mouse between priests and government spies, as Queen Elizabeth and her ministers fought to defend the state, and English Catholics fought to defend their souls. It follows the priests -- God's Secret Agents -- from their schooling on the Continent, through their perilous return journeys and their lonely lives in hiding, to the scaffold, where a gruesome death awaited them. To their government they were traitors; to their fellow Catholics they were glorious martyrs. It was a distinction that the Gunpowder Plot would put to the test. Ultimately God's Secret Agents is the story of men who would die for their cause undone by men who would kill for it.",

        "Title": "Soldier Slaves: Abandoned by the White House, Courts and Congress",
        "Authors": "By Parkinson, James W. and Benson, Lee",
        "Description": "\"The stories told in this book \u2013 stories from the war, stories from the courtrooms of America, and stories from the State Department and the halls of Congress--are stories that need to be heard. They are entertaining, informative, historically important, at times hopeful, at times disappointing, and always inspirational.\" -- From the foreword by Senators Orrin Hatch and Joseph BidenThe Battling Bastards of Bataan, and all others who paid a dear price for freedom as Pacific Theater prisoners-of-war, deserve--and need--to be remembered. Not just for them, but for us.Decades-old war abuses are given up-to-the-minute relevance in this book about World War II American soldiers seeking restitution from Japanese companies that used them as slave laborers during the war. Their tale is told by the lawyer representing them, James Parkinson. With the help of a well-known journalist, Parkinson ties the present to the past by interspersing horrific war narrative with modern-day dramas played out in courtrooms and congressional hearing rooms as lawyers, judges, senators, and congressmen debate the merits of a case now known as the JPOW case. In the process, wartime brutality confronts peacetime prosperity, and economics, not military might, determines the outcome.Using the personal history of one of the veterans he represents--a munitions mechanic from the Army Air Corps named Harold Poole--to illustrate what happened, Parkinson traces a path that began with the infamous Bataan Death March of April 1942 and three and a half years of forced labor, followed by years of silence forced on the veterans by their own government and lingering medical and emotional problems. Readers will be drawn into the case as the extent of the abuse meted out by the Japanese is revealed and the POWs' effort to be compensated unfolds. While Parkinson agrees that there might be legitimate debate over whether the soldiers are entitled to back wages from the Japanese corporations who benefited from their labor, he is adamant that their story be more widely known. With the support of influential senators like Orrin Hatch and Joseph Biden and the publication of this book, he is reaching thousands of Americans.",

Fictional accounts of the Grail have topped best-seller lists over the years, The Da Vinci Code being only the most recent among them. But the truth about the Grail&#151;where truth can be brought to light&#151;is even more electrifying than the most exciting novel ever written.

Then probing still more deeply into the story of the Grail, he&#151;    Examines the part the chalice plays in Christ's Passion Tells stories of the secret societies that guarded the Grail's mysteries  Explores Grail theories that speculate on the holy bloodline of Jesus and Mary  Magdalene, and on an alternate theory of the Grail as the philosopher's stone   Describes modern Grail seekers, and reveals why even the Nazis sought it   These and hundreds more fascinating details will keep readers turning pages to the book's final chapter.

As the Romans expand their rule from their newly founded capital city on its seven hills, the civilization of their elegant forerunners, the Etruscans, is waning. Into this era of flux and change strides a young figure destined to become one of the classical world's great mythic heroes.When Vesi, a young Etruscan noblewoman, is raped by a supernatural being who was once human, a child is conceived. Outcast from Etruria but watched over by her mother and the shades of her ancestors, Vesi bears a son she calls Horatrim. A child who is dangerous both to the Etruscans and to his own father, he is gifted with arcane knowledge and supernatural abilities, but has a human heart. He grows to manhood in only six years. Then circumstances place him and his mother on the road to Rome, where his talents impress a powerful trader and politician, Propertius. The Roman adopts Horatrim and changes his name to Horatius - a name that will ring down the ages.More than glory awaits the young man. His demon sire is pursuing Horatrim to kill him. The demon has problems of his own, however, for he has angered the goddess Pythia by betraying her. Pythia's acolytes are on his trail even as he hunts for his son. When the king of Rome is murdered and Vesi is kidnapped from his palace, Horatius must unravel the secrets of his own existence in order to save her. Aided by an Aegyptian priest, Horatius sets out for the Land of the Dead to rescue his mother from the bowels of hell.",

For Craig is familiar with details of Paul's life: where he lives, his wife Abby's work schedule, and the terrible accident that killed their two-year-old son and left their marriage in a precarious balance between love and grief.   Then Paul seems to spot Craig observing him in a crowded mall, and at home he notices things slightly out of place or missing, including the handgun he keeps for personal protection.  Paul soon is trapped in an ever-tightening web of circumstance and scrutiny that implicates him in the eyes of his wife, his colleagues, and eventually the police.  As the battle of wits turns deadly, with his career on the line and his life over the edge, Paul must learn to play the game by Craig's rules-for he who tells the best lie wins.Smart and wickedly suspenseful, The Interview Room winds through twists and turns to a place where nothing is as it seems.",

Capricorn (Cap for short) had lived every day of his life on Garland Farm growing fruits and vegetables. He was homeschooled by Rain, the only person he knew in the world. Life was simple for Cap. But when Rain falls out of a tree while picking plums and is hospital-ridden, he has to attend the local middle school and live with his new guidance counselor and her irritable daughter. While Cap knew a lot about Zen Buddhism, no amount formal education could ready him for the trials and tribulations of public middle school.  Cap doesn't exactly fit in at Claverage Middle School (dubbed C Average by the kids). He has long, ungroomed hair, wears hemp clothes, and practices Tai Chi out on the lawn. His weirdness basically makes him biggest nerd in school. This is great news for Zach Powers, big man on campus.  He can't wait to instate the age-old tradition in C-Average School:  The biggest nerd is nominated for class president--and wins.  So when Cap becomes president, he is more puzzled than ever.  But as Cap begins to take on his duties, the joke starts to turn on Zach.   Will Cap turn out to be the greatest President in the history of C-Average School?  Or the biggest punchline?",

        "Description": "Although the public most often associates dementia with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the medical profession now distinguishes various types of \"other\" dementias. This book is the first comprehensive guide dealing with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), one of the largest groups of non-Alzheimer\u2019s dementias. The contributors are either specialists in their fields or have exceptional hands-on experience with FTD sufferers.Beginning with a focus on the medical facts, the first part defines and explores FTD as an illness distinct from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Also considered are clinical and medical care issues and practices, as well as such topics as finding a medical team and rehabilitation interventions. The next section on managing care examines the daily care routine including exercise, socialization, adapting the home environment, and behavioral issues. In the following section on caregiver resources, the contributors identify professional and government assistance programs along with private resources and legal options.This newly revised edition follows recent worldwide collaboration in research and provides the most current medical information available, a better understanding of the different classifications of FTD, and more clarity regarding the role of genetics. A completely new chapter 5 enlightens the reader about the various drugs that are now being used with FTD patients and also delves into a number of nonmedical options. The wealth of information offered in these pages will help both healthcare professionals and caregivers of someone suffering from frontotemporal dementia.",

        "Authors": "By Grote, Richard C.",
        "Description": "Grote's Discipline Without Punishment system is a proven management technique for handling the everyday problems of absenteeism, bad attitudes, and poor performance. Used successfully at such companies as Frito-Lay, Southwestern Bell, United Airlines, Exxon, and GE, this innovative approach replaces existing punitive disciplinary policies with an affirmative program that makes problem employees take personal responsibility for their actions; avoids confrontational, anger-provoking situations that can damage relationships and sometimes even lead to violence and salvages potentially good employees who have gotten off the track.The book provides a complete explanation of the philosophy and mechanics of Discipline Without Punishment. In keeping with the author's overall positive approach, early chapters focus on ways to recognize good performance and techniques for solving people problems before they require disciplinary action. Grote next explores how to prepare for and conduct coaching sessions, with emphasis on problem-solving and enhancing relationships.Packed with sample dialogues, detailed flowcharts, and specific do's and don'ts, this valuable guide covers every aspect of putting Discipline Without Punishment to work in your organization - from gaining management and employee buy-in, to creating, administering, managing, and maintaining the system. It even supplies a chapter on termination - when all else fails - that makes the process as painless as possible for both the company and the employee.",

The house has been designed to meet the needs of the tall, slender giraffe. The elephant smashes into doorways and walls trying to maneuver. The giraffe gently suggests aerobics and ballet classes. The elephant is unconvinced. To him, the house is the problem...R. Roosevelt Thomas, one of America's most respected experts on diversity, uses the metaphor of giraffes and elephants - insiders and outsiders - to examine our assumptions about power, influence, affirmative action, and acceptance of \"the others.\" His richly accessible guide will have you thinking about these critical issues in a whole new way.
