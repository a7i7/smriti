But Sam's mission is soon threatened by the unlikeliest of sources -- he falls hopelessly in love with Mila, daughter of the local political agent. Mila, unexpectedly attracted to Sam, nurtures a secret of her own and finds herself torn between loyalty to her family and Sam.The Splendor of Silence opens twenty-one years later with Olivia, Sam's daughter, receiving a trunk of treasures from India, along with a letter from an unknown narrator that finally fills all the silences of her childhood -- telling her the story of her parents' passionate and enduring love for each other that throws them in the path of racial prejudice, nationalist intrigue, and the explosive circumstances of a country and a society on the brink of independence from British rule.Sweeping and poignant, reminiscent of Paul Scott's Raj Quartet novels, The Splendor of Silence will draw a host of devoted new fans to this hugely gifted storyteller.",

A solitary journey in the winter of 1807-8 took him into present-day Wyoming. To unbelieving trappers he later reported sights that inspired the name of Colter's Hell. It was a sulfurous place of hidden fires, smoking pits, and shooting water. And it was real. John Colter is known to history as probably the first white man to discover the region that now includes Yellowstone National Park. In a classic book, first published in 1952, Burton Harris weighs the facts and legends about a man who was dogged by misfortune and \"robbed of the just rewards he had earned.\" This Bison Book edition includes a 1977 addendum by the author and a new introduction by David Lavender, who considers Colter's remarkable winter journey in the light of current scholarship.",

News of his brutal murder in February 2002 was universally denounced, a tragic loss of a good man and a compassionate journalist who was at home anywhere in the world.  At Home in the World celebrates Pearl's life through 50 of his best stories. Edited by his longtime friend and colleague, Helene Cooper, At Home in the World gives testimony to Mr. Pearl's extraordinary skill as a writer and to his talent for friendship and collaboration. With datelines from the United States and abroad, the articles showcase a dogged reporter who never lost sight of the humanity behind the news. A foreword by his widow, Mariane Pearl, and a contribution by his father, Judea Pearl, celebrate his desire to change the world, his basic decency and fair-mindedness and his sense of fun and love of family.  Mr. Pearl's eye for quirky stories -- many of which appeared in the Journal's iconic \"middle column\" -- and his skill in tracking leads, uncovering wrongdoing and making friends of strangers of all backgrounds and cultures are apparent throughout this carefully assembled collection. The selections range from child beauty pageants in the South to the making of the world's largest Persian rug to the Taliban's exploitation of a gemstone market in order to fund terrorism. Anecdotes from friends and colleagues in the introduction to each section provide background, context and a glimpse of his life at the Journal.  At Home in the World keeps alive Daniel Pearl's spirit through his words and the work that was so important to him.",

And just as misery loves company, so does Kinky Friedman, the erstwhile Sherlock in question, love his tormentors from above -- enough so that when someone sends a threatening missive to the head lesbian dance-person, Winnie Katz, Kinky, in a mood of forgive-and-forget, sets out to find the perpetrator and to save the day.  Of course, just as nothing is ever as it seems, so is Kinky \"Ace Private Big Dick\" Friedman, not quite so altruistic as he may appear -- for, in fact, it was the Kinkster himself who wrote the threatening note to Ms. Katz, and then called upon each of his ubiquitous Village Irregulars (the mighty Mike McGovern, the mercurial Ratso Sloman, the marvelous Stephanie Dupont, and the masterful Steve Rambam) to solve the mystery, and in the process give Kinky a first-rate opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of each of his would-be Watsons.  But just as it's not where you start but where you finish, so does Kinky soon find himself caught up in a conundrum of Sherlockian proportions when the bogus death threat turns suddenly, chillingly real -- and an actual killer steps forward to carry out Kinky's impotent threat.  And just as all things must end, so must this flap copy.",

But this is Manhattan, and Bill has much further to fall. His downward spiral lands him at the table of Allison Sparks, the dangerously alluring owner of a midtown steakhouse. She needs a personal favor of him--to engineer a midnight trade-off in a shady multimillion-dollar real estate deal. For a man with nothing left to lose, the set-up is too lucrative to refuse, and like Allison, too forbidden to resist. But her favor draws him deeper into a web of sex, deception, and murder--and to a secret place at the back of her restaurant, the Havana Room, where a man might find both evil and redemption. The Havana Room is a great New York thriller from a modern master of the genre.",

        "Description": "September 11, 2001, distinguished Cold War historian John Lewis Gaddis argues, was not the first time a surprise attack shattered American assumptions about national security and reshaped American grand strategy. We've been there before, and have responded each time by dramatically expanding our security responsibilities.The pattern began in 1814, when the British attacked Washington, burning the White House and the Capitol. This early violation of homeland security gave rise to a strategy of unilateralism and preemption, best articulated by John Quincy Adams, aimed at maintaining strength beyond challenge throughout the North American continent. It remained in place for over a century. Only when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941 did the inadequacies of this strategy become evident: as a consequence, the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt devised a new grand strategy of cooperation with allies on an intercontinental scale to defeat authoritarianism. That strategy defined the American approach throughout World War II and the Cold War.The terrorist attacks of 9/11, Gaddis writes, made it clear that this strategy was now insufficient to ensure American security. The Bush administration has, therefore, devised a new grand strategy whose foundations lie in the nineteenth-century tradition of unilateralism, preemption, and hegemony, projected this time on a global scale. How successful it will be in the face of twenty-first-century challenges is the question that confronts us. This provocative book, informed by the experiences of the past but focused on the present and the future, is one of the first attempts by a major scholar of grand strategy and international relations to provide an answer.",

        "Title": "Money and the Meaning of Life",
        "Authors": "By Needleman, Jacob",
        "Description": "If we understood the true role of money in our lives, writes philosopher Jacob Needleman, we would not think simply in terms of spending it or saving it. Money exerts a deep emotional influence on who we are and what we tell ourselves we can never have. Our long unwillingness to understand the emotional and spiritual effects of money on us is at the heart of why we have come to know the price of everything, and the value of nothing. Money has everything to do with the pursuit of an idealistic life, while at the same time, it is at the root of our daily frustrations. On a social level, money has a profound impact on the price of progress. Needleman shows how money slowly began to haunt us, from the invention of coins in Biblical times (when money was created to rescue the community good, not for self gain), through its hypnotic appeal in our money-obsessed era. This is a remarkable book that combines myth and psychology, the poetry of the Sufis and the wisdom of King Solomon, along with Jacob Needleman's searching of his own soul and his culture to explain how money can become a unique means of self-knowledge. As part of the Currency paperback line, it includes a \"User's Guide\" an introduction and discussion guide created for the paperback by the author -- to help readers make practical use of the book's ideas.",

        "Authors": "By Haskins, Susan",
        "Description": "Mary Magdalen has always been a predominant and fascinating figure for Christianity. But who was she really? The Gnostics hailed her as the companion of the Savior and the woman He loved most. Early Christian writers called her the Bride of Christ and the apostle to the apostles. But for centuries her most durable image has been that of a prostitute who repented and devoted her life to Jesus - an image that both shaped and to some extent reflected the Church's attitude toward women. Yet this figure does not appear in the New Testament.All that we know of the real Magdalen are the four facts noted in the Gospels: she was one of Christ's followers; she was present at His crucifixion; she was one of the earliest witnesses of His resurrection; and she was the first person to be charged with proclaiming the Christian message. But somewhere along the line she was confused with Mary, the sister of Lazarus, and with the woman taken in adultery whose life Jesus saved.Using evidence from early Christian writings, medieval sermons, devotional works, and the art and literature of nearly two thousand years, Susan Haskins shows how Mary Magdalen merged with other figures in the New Testament until she came to epitomize the condition of women in the Church and in society. Today, when women are assuming more active roles in both, Mary Magdalen is once again being reevaluated.",

Very little has ever really been known about what happened to her back then, how she lived-but the past is about to come alive. Crime School begins with the discovery of a woman found hanging in a burning apartment, tufts of her own blond hair stuck in her mouth and red candles scattered all around. Immediately, Mallory knows several things. The fire was set so the woman would be discovered. The crime is identical to another one twenty years old. And she knows this woman. She is a prostitute named Sparrow, who took her in all those many years ago, and then betrayed her. There is unfinished business between Mallory and Sparrow, and the quest to settle it will send her spinning back to a time of secrets and desperation, and into the mind of a criminal whose work has only just begun.",

        "Title": "A Walk on the Beach: Tales of Wisdom From an Unconventional Woman",
        "Authors": "By Anderson, Joan",
        "Description": "From the author of the bestselling A Year By the Sea, comes the inspiring story about how her and Joan Erikson's friendship pushed them to remember the importance of transformation and sustained them through their unique challenges.\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after arriving on Cape Cod to spend a year by herself, Joan Anderson\u2019s chance   encounter with a wise and astonishing woman helped her usher in the self-discoveries that led to her ongoing renewal. First glimpsed as a slender   figure on a fogged-in beach, Joan Erikson was not only a friend and confidante when   she was most needed, but also a guide as Anderson stretched and grew into her unfinished   self. Joan Erikson was perhaps best known for her collaboration with her husband,   Erik, a pioneering psychoanalyst and noted author. After Erik\u2019s death, she wrote   several books extending their theory of the stages of life to reflect her understanding   of aging as she neared ninety-five. But her wisdom was best taught through their   friendship; as she sat with Anderson, weaving tapestries of their lives with brightly   colored yarn while exploring the strength gathered from their accumulated experiences,   Joan Erikson\u2019s lessons took shape on their small cardboard looms as well as in her   friend\u2019s revitalized life. In writing about their extraordinary friendship, Anderson   reveals a need she didn\u2019t know she had: for a mentor to help navigate the transitions   she faced as she grew beyond middle age. And when Joan Erikson had to face her husband\u2019s   death and the growing limitations of her own body, Anderson was able to give back   some of the wisdom she had gleaned. To this poignant, joyful account, Joan Anderson   brings the candor and sensitivity that have made her an acclaimed speaker and writer   on midlife and its possibilities. A Walk on the Beach is an experience to savor and   treasure, a glimpse of the exuberant spirit that can be sustained and passed on in   all our friendships.",

He was not going to abandon me now. God would have to heal the emotional  pain that throbbed through my body.\"As a child, Dorie was rejected  by her mother, sent to live in an orphanage where she was regularly beaten by the  orphanage director, was beaten time and again by cruel foster parents, and was daily  told that she was ugly and unlovable. Dorie never knew love until a group of college  students visited the orphanage and told her that God loved her. As she accepted  that love, her life began to change. Dorie is a thrilling true account  of what God's love can do in a life. Doris Van Stone takes readers through the hard  years of her childhood into her fascinating years as a missionary with her husband  to the Dani tribe in New Guinea. With the rise of illegitimate births, the increase  in divorce statistics, and the frightening escalation of child abuse, this story  stands as a reminder that God's love, forgiveness, and grace are greater than human  hurt and sorrow.
