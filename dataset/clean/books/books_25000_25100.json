Dan seemed the perfect man for her: handsome literate, articulate. They had a baby - Trina - who bound the four of them together. They had become a family, inviolable.

He's older, not necessarily wiser, and still fumbling with love and life amid the strange campus doings of the 1990s.Leland Edwards, a piano-playing, fly-fishing English professor, has become Dean of Rookery State College. And since the president of the college has been on automatic pilot for the last thirty years, it falls to Leland to save his beloved campus from diminished enrollment, hockey thuggery, and its ignoble associations with Paul Bunyan.Then his old pal from the Icejam Quartet, Peggy Benoit Connor, drops a fund-raising plum in his lap. The most famous poet in America, Richard Falcon, has agreed to come to Rookery. Leland envisions thousands coming from all over the Midwest to hear Falcon's reading--an event that will put Rookery State on the literary map.But when he arrives, the poet is both more and  less than what Leland expected. Their relationship leads Leland back to memories of the father he lost when he was fourteen--and on a wild ride that will compel him to harbor a fugitive, stand up to his domineering mother, and finally make peace with his brief attempt at love and the tragedy that ensued. Like old friends past and present, Leland and his cronies come alive to amuse, provoke, and ultimately surprise us with their touching, complicated humanity. Once again, Jon Hassler has written a novel that shows that is he one of the most gifted authors working today.",

Her father is off to the Colonies on business, but is far overdue to be home. Thus Larissa is left to handle the rumors of her family's bankruptcy, panicked creditors pounding on her door, and eviction. On top of all that, she must now contend with her enigmatic would-be \"benefactor,\"  Vincent Everett, the Baron of Windsmoor. The charming and handsome rogue has offered to shelter Larissa, her little brother, and their few remaining servants in his own home, and Larissa has no choice but to accept his proposal -- unless she and her younger brother Thomas wish to wake up chin-deep in snow on Christmas morning.The baron would be the first to admit that it is more than the Yuletide spirit of good will that has inspired his generosity. From the moment he first set eyes on the enchanting Miss Ascot, he was bewitched. And now that she has taken up residence in his home as well as in his heart, he aches with wanting her -- a most unfortunate state of Airs, since the proud beauty obviously despises him...and since Vincent had previously sworn to seek a righteous vengeance on Larissa's family.But Christmas is a time of miracles, after all, when love, at the seasonal peak of its power, can triumph over all adversity. The more the lovely lady resists Vincent's considerable attractions, the hotter her desire for him grows. And in these magical days, something truly wondrous could occur -- as the spirit of forgiveness reaches down to touch two rival souls ... and shower Vincent and Larissa with precious gifts of tenderness and ecstasy unbound.",

The critics agree: no one writes suspense like Karin Slaughter, whose thrillers featuring medical examiner Sara Linton and her ex-husband, police chief Jeffrey Tolliver, have propelled her to the top of bestseller lists the world over. Now Slaughter fuses her unmatched grasp of forensic science and a mastery of complex relationships in a riveting tale of faith, doubt, and murder.The victim was buried alive in the Georgia woods\u2014then killed in a horrifying fashion. When Sara Linton and Jeffrey Tolliver stumble upon the body, both become consumed with finding out who killed the pretty, impeccably dressed young woman.  And for Sara and Jeffrey, a harrowing journey begins, one that will test their own turbulent relationship and draw dozens of lives into the case.Lena Adams is one of them. A Grant County detective for years, she has her own reasons for being drawn to this case and a fierce drive to see justice done.  For these three people, who have each seen the darkest side of human nature, the body of the murdered girl is but the first in a series of shocking and sordid revelations.Now, as Jeffrey and Sara narrow the field of suspects, they must confront their own doubts and indiscretions, while Lena Adams sees herself reflected in the frightened eyes of a battered woman who may be the key figure in the case. As Faithless builds to a stunning and unforgettable climax, Karin Slaughter masterfully brings together strands of interlocking lives, family secrets, and hidden passions with one astounding truth: the identity of a killer who is more evil and dangerous than anyone could have guessed.",

        "Title": "Mad Cowboy: Plain Truth from the Cattle Rancher Who Won't Eat Meat",
        "Authors": "By Lyman, Howard F. and Merzer, Glen",
        "Description": "When former cattle rancher Howard Lyman appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1996 to share his insider view of the danger of Mad Cow Disease spreading to this country, his revelations about the beef industry prompted a group of Texas cattlemen to file a lawsuit charging Lyman and the talk show host with \"food disparagement.\" That wasn't enough to silence Howard Lyman, and in this stirring account of his journey from meat-loving cowboy to vegetarian environmental activist, he tells the whole truth about the catastrophic consequences of an animal-based diet.  Lyman is well aware of what goes into our livestock -- high doses of pesticides, growth hormone, and the ground-up remains of other animals. A fourth-generation Montana farmer, he regularly doused his cattle and soil with chemicals. It was only when he narrowly escaped paralysis from a spinal tumor that Lyman began to question his vocation and the effect it was having on people and on the land he loved. The questions he raised and the answers he found led him, surprisingly, to adopt a vegetarian diet. As a result, he lost 130 pounds and lowered his cholesterol by more than 150 points. He is now one of America's leading spokesmen for vegetarianism.  Along the way, Lyman learned even more about the alarming dangers associated with eating meat. Here he blasts through the propaganda of the beef and dairy industries (and the government agencies that often protect them) and exposes an animal-based diet as the primary cause of cancer, heart disease, and obesity in this country. In a powerful and original voice, he warns that our livestock industry has repeated the mistakes that led to Mad Cow Disease in England while it simultaneously visits frightful, lasting damage on our environment.  Persuasive, straightforward, and full of the down-home good humor and optimism of a son of the soil, Mad Cowboy is both an inspirational story of personal transformation and a convincing call to action for a plant-based diet -- for the good of the planet and the health of us all.",

        "Description": "Do you suffer from heartburn?  Is an ulcer bothering you?  Are the difficult symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome compromising your life?  If so, you are not alone.  One in three Americans has some sort of digestive problem.  After the common cold, gastrointestinal complaints are the biggest cause of employee absenteeism in the United States.  And since GI disorders are so often interrelated, many people who have them suffer from two or more at the same time. Here, in a completely revised and updated edition, is everything you need to know to find fast relief from a wide range of gastrointestinal difficulties.  Whether it&#39;s constipation, diarrhea, gas, hemorrhoids, ulcers, heartburn, colitis, gallstones, or one of the many other digestive tract problems, Dr. Steven Peikin&#39;s self-help nutritional program will help keep you out of the doctor&#39;s office--and feeling great.Based on the latest research and his own clinical experience, Dr. Peikin prescribes a healthy diet high in fiber and low in fat, spices, lactose, and caffeine.  He provides a detailed list of \"flag foods\" to avoid in the case of specific problems and shows you how to use exercise, over-the-counter drugs, prescription drugs, and stress management to complement the program.  In this new edition, Dr. Peikin offers the latest information on the diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori, the bacterium that causes ulcers and stomach cancer; the newest remedies for severe heartburn; recommendations for avoiding colon cancer through screening and prevention; and a significantly expanded section on Inflammatory Bowel Disease. If you suffer from digestive problems, you know that gastrointestinal health can make all the difference in living comfortably from day to day.  Dr. Peikin&#39;s classic book can show you the way.",

        "Title": "Behind the Oscar: Secret History of the Academy Awards",
        "Authors": "By Holden, Anthony",
        "Description": "Simple hype? Is that really all there is behind the Oscar? Just a lot of propaganda, a frenzied ritual of self-promotion, a debasement of character and culture - and for what? A shiny statuette of a naked and featureless little man?Well, yes, maybe \"hype\" is a major part of the whole affair, but \"simple\"...? Not by a long shot.Every year, on the last Monday in March, the reigning royalty of the movie business dress up in their finest feathers - sometimes literally - to attend the ceremony sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. At that ceremony, years of struggle and study and sacrifice and hard work - capped by weeks of intense campaigning, awesome in-fighting, blatant self-aggrandizement, and shameless displays of naked desire - are rewarded. The Academy Awards!As Anthony Holden explains at the start of Behind the Oscar, his fascinating and devilish look at this perennial affair, \"However rich and famous movie stars may become, however admired and envied by audiences and colleagues alike, their cup will not actually run over until their name emerges from one of [the] envelopes, and they can sob their way through an Oscar acceptance speech. [The] winners will bask in the glow of apparent immortality - the highest honor even Hollywood can confer - as well a boosting their fantastical fees. For those already in possession of most that this world can offer, it is a consummation devoutly to be wished - and a wish they will go to any lengths to consummate.\"Historically, the Academy Awards, first presented in 1927, were an offshoot of an effort by the then-powerful Hollywood studios to defeat the unions that threatened to cut into their considerable profits. At first the Awards were self-congratulatory, back-slapping affairs, dinner parties at which actors and actresses who had kept their noses clean and whose movies had made money were rewarded for their work.Quickly, however, these annual rites assumed a life of their own, growing over the years to the self-congratulatory, back-slapping colossus that today fascinates millions and millions of people the world over.Behind the Oscar is the story of these awards and how they grew, and, in a way, it's the story of Hollywood itself. Spanning the entire history of the Awards (including the 1991 Academy Awards) and reviewing the famous winners and losers (e.g., Katharine Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin), and the not-so-famous people (Luise Rainer, winner of back-to-back Oscars for Best Actress) whose lives have been touched by Oscar magic, Anthony Holden cleverly guides the reader through the ins and outs, the complex, confounding machinations that make up Oscar's history.Complete with a multitude of award lists, dozens of photos, and enough behind-the-scenes gossip to satisfy even the most jaded, Behind the Oscar is the best written, most enlightening, and easily the most entertaining look ever at Hollywood at its best and worst.To paraphrase Sally Field upon winning her second Oscar: \"You'll like it, you'll really like it!\"",

        "Title": "Dark Lady",
        "Authors": "By Patterson, Richard North",
        "Description": "In Dark Lady, Richard North Patterson displays the mastery of setting, psychology, and story that makes him unique among writers of suspense, and one of today's most original and enthralling novelists.In Steelton, a struggling Midwestern city on the cusp of an economic turnaround, two prominent men are found dead within days of each other. One is Tommy Fielding, a senior officer of the company building a new baseball stadium, the city's hope for the future. The other is Jack Novak, the local drug dealers' attorney of choice. Fielding's death with a prostitute, from an overdose of heroin, seems accidental; Novak is apparently the victim of a ritual murder. But in each case the character of the dead man seems contradicted by the particulars of his death. Coincidence or connection?The question falls to Assistant County Prosecutor Stella Marz. Despite a traumatic breach with her alcoholic and embittered father, she has risen from a working-class background to become head of the prosecutor's homicide unit. A driven woman, she is called the Dark Lady by defense lawyers for her relentless, sometimes ruthless, style: in seven years only one case has gotten away from her, and only because the defendant took his own life. She has earned every inch of both her official and her off-the-record titles, and recently she's decided to go after another: to become the first woman elected Prosecutor of Erie County. But that was before the brutal murder of her ex-lover--Jack Novak.Novak's death leads her into a labyrinth where her personal and professional lives become dangerously intertwined. There is the possibility that Novak fixed drug cases for the city's crime lord, Vincent Moro, with the help of law enforcement personnel, and perhaps with someone in Stella's own office . . . the bitter mayoral race which threatens to undermine her own ambitions . . . her attraction to a colleague who may not be what he seems . . . the lingering, complicated effects of her painful affair with Novak . . . the growing certainty that she is being watched and followed. Making her way through a maze of corruption, deceit, and greed, trusting no one, Stella comes to believe that the search for the truth involves the bleak history of Steelton itself--a history that now endangers her future, and perhaps her life.For his uncanny dialogue, subtle delineation of character, and hypnotic narrative, critics have compared Richard North Patterson to John O'Hara and Dashiell Hammett. Now, in the character of the Dark Lady, he has created a woman as fascinating as her world is haunting. Dark Lady is his signature work.",

Rage offers a powerful new case in point, as Delaware and LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis revisit a horrifying crime from the past that has taken on shocking and deadly new dimensions. Troy Turner and Rand Duchay were barely teenagers when they kidnapped and murdered a younger child. Troy, a remorseless sociopath, died violently behind bars. But the hulking, slow-witted Rand managed to survive his stretch. Now, at age twenty-one, he\u2019s emerged a haunted, rootless young man with a pressing need: to talk\u2013once again\u2013with psychologist Alex Delaware. But the young killer comes to a brutal end, that conversation never takes place. Has karma caught up with Rand? Or has someone waited for eight patient years to dine on ice-cold revenge? Both seem strong possibilities to Sturgis, but Delaware\u2019s suspicions run deeper . . . and darker. Because fear in the voice of the grownup Rand Duchay\u2013and his eerie final words to Alex: \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person\u201d\u2013betray untold secrets. Buried revelations so horrendous, and so damning, they\u2019re worth killing for.As Delaware and Sturgis retrace their steps through a grisly murder case that devastated a community, they discover a chilling legacy of madness, suicide, and multiple killings left in its wake\u2013and even uglier truths waiting to be unearthed. And the nearer they come to understanding an unspeakable crime, the more harrowingly close they get to unmasking a monster hiding in plain sight.Rage finds Jonathan Kellerman in phenomenal form\u2013orchestrating a relentlessly suspenseful, devilishly unpredictable plot to a finale as stunning and thought-provoking as it is satisfying.",

Returning to her wealthy, politically influential family from nine years of self-imposed exile, she is determined to discover the truth for herself, and willing to risk anything and everything to find the answers.

But secrets are nothing new in the District, where the best and worst of humanity nestle side by side in marble halls and on rubble-strewn streets. Only after the personal lives of cops and victims become intertwined does the truth begin to emerge, and even the hardened detectives are unprepared to grasp the full horror behind Elizabeth's murder and a terrifying conspiracy with its roots in the arrogance of money, the burdens of power, and the secrets of ... the betrayed.",

        "Description": "In the comfortable confines of Greenwich, Connecticut, live some of the wealthiest and most sophisticated Americans. When eight of them sit down to dinner at the home of Richard Castle, a story of deception, infidelity, and murder unfolds, powered by a richly intriguing cast of characters.Castle, former Assistant Secretary for Latin American Affairs, permitted, if not directed, the murder of three Catholic nuns and a lay worker in El Salvador in 1980. Now, State Department complicity in these murders has become public knowledge, and Castle may well be called before Congress to testify. While he cannot be certain that his former colleagues intend to silence him, he knows how they do business. And he knows how silence is ensured.Against the background of Castle's deeply secret drama, the stories of the other seven guests - Castle's wife, a Catholic priest, a nun, a linguistics professor and his wife, a successful novelist, and a woman who may be having an affair with Castle - become a portrait of arrogance and innocence, brutality and compassion in America today.",

        "Title": "John Calvin: A Sixteenth-Century Portrait",
        "Authors": "By Bouwsma, William J.",
        "Description": "Historians have credited--or blamed--Calvinism for many developments in the modern world, including capitalism, modern science, secularization, democracy, individualism, and unitarianism. These same historians, however, have largely ignored John Calvin the man. When people consider him at all, they tend to view him as little more than the joyless tyrant of Geneva who created an abstract theology as forbidding as himself.This volume, written by the eminent historian William J. Bouwsma, who has devoted his career to exploring the larger patterns of early modern European history, seeks to redress these common misconceptions of Calvin by placing him back in the proper historical context of his time.Eloquently depicting Calvin's life as a French exile, a humanist in the tradition of Erasmus, and a man unusually sensitive to the complexities and contradictions of later Renaissance culture, Bouwsma reveals a surprisingly human, plausible, ecumenical, and often sympathetic Calvin. John Calvin offers a brilliant reassessment not only of Calvin but also of the Reformation and its relationship to the movements of the Renaissance.",

Just don&#146;t leave this book where any regular voters can read it!\"&#150;Arianna Huffington, author of Pigs at the TroughEvery day corporations and other wealthy special interests pump another $2 million into the coffers of our elected officials in Washington and their party committees. For their money they get an estimated $160 billion a year in tax breaks, subsidies, and other sweet deals. That&#146;s $160 billion lifted from taxpayers&#146; pockets&#150;or about $1,500 per taxpayer per year! But that&#146;s not the worst of it. Their money also buys them the opportunity to shape public policy to suit their bottom lines. And the cost we pay for that is much dearer. Blending satirical bite with mountains of eye-opening research, this rollicking call to arms breaks the issue into manageable, kitchen-table topics and makes it accessible with graphs, tables, sidebars, quizzes, and fascinating factoids.\"Sifry and Watzman lay it all out with no bark on it in this devastatingly straight-forward book&#150;the overt corruption of our country through what we politely call &#145;the campaign finance system.&#146; Legalized bribery is the root of our political rot and few people know more about how to fix it and have done more to fix it than the good folks at Public Campaign.\"&#150;Molly Ivins, author of Bushwhacked\"Sifry and Watzman are two of the most astute observers of political influence in this country.

        "Title": "Generous Lives: American Catholic Women Today",
        "Authors": "By Redmont, Jane",
        "Description": "Women are the heart and soul of the Catholic church, passing on its faith and traditions to the next generation. But an exclusively male hierarchy voices official teaching on faith and the moral life, and excludes from the ordained ministry the women who dedicate so much of their lives to the Church. More and more American Catholic women are choosing to leave the Church, yet most of them stay. Why? What does it mean to these women to be Catholic? To be women? To be American? In Generous Lives, Jane Redmont has gone beyond theories and taken these questions directly to the women in the street, creating a realistic and fascinating portrait of the female half of a living religion.Redmont interviewed more than a hundred American women between the ages of seventeen and ninety-two, in cities, suburbs, and rural areas from New England to south Texas and California to Wisconsin. They represent a changing church, one that reflects the diversity of American cultures and that is as much African-American and Asian-American as Irish or Hispanic. Deeply committed to their church, painfully alienated, or barely involved, all these women have deep and rich spiritual lives. Few experience crises of faith, but many question the shape and practices of the institutional church. Priests are key religious figures in their lives, but so are other women. Virtually all wonder whether their religious family views them as fully adult human beings.Being a Catholic woman in the United States has as much to do with \"American\" and \"woman\" as it does with \"Catholic.\" Redmont examines how Catholic women work, love, vote, and pray. A lively and opinionated group, the women of Generous Lives speak their minds on a range of issues including poverty, violence, death and the afterlife, abortion, child-rearing, feminism, friendship, marriage, homosexuality, and the relationship and difference between women and men.Those who do stay in the Church stay on their own terms, critical yet positive, testing tradition against their experience and the voice of their conscience, which guides them on matters ranging from politics to birth control. Most do not see themselves as dissenters. Faithful, active, strong, and generous - often to a fault - the women of Generous Lives are the living church. The core of their Catholic life is the celebration of the sacraments and the commitment to the welfare of others - a belief in a generous God and in the necessity of leading a generous life.",

        "Description": "Here is the first and only book devoted exclusively to cultivating the world's most widely grown vegetable - the potato. For the home gardener, few pursuits can be more rewarding than growing this perenially popular plant: The potato proffers a prodigious harvest - one 20-foot-square plot can yield over 400 pounds of spuds! Besides providing tasty tubers, however, potato plants will also add beauty to any plot with their lush, dark green leaves and lovely white flowers. For both beginning and experienced gardeners it's the perfect addition to a vegetable garden.More than a growing manual, The Potato Garden is the ultimate guide to potato culture. Chapter One serves up the history of the potato and is heaped with tuber trivia, such as the spud's South American origins, its voyage to Europe, and subsequent success on supper tables around the world. Later chapters offer invaluable hands-on information on how to create a potato plot that will thrive from early summer through late autumn, and include step-by-step instructions on selecting and preparing a planting site; preparing seed potatoes and slips; planting, watering, and feeding; pest prevention and control; harvesting; and storage. Alternative planting methods, such as deep mulch, specialized potato binds, and even ornamental containers, complete the range of cultivation options. And, since all of the growing methods are organic, potato planters can avoid harmful pesticides and enjoy a healthy and delicious harvest.The centerpiece of The Potato Garden is the Potato Portfolio packed with complete portraits of over 200 potatoes - virtually every variety that will grow in an American garden! From pint-size Peruvians to bulky ldahos, from mellow to tangy to fruity-tasting tubers, each spud encompasses a spectacular spectrum. Here are 'Fenton Blue,' an heirloom variety from Maine with purple skin and appealing blue flesh; 'Cherries Jubilee,' a tasty new variety that is irresistibly rosy outside and delicately pale pink inside; 'Desiree,' a popular European variety with a sultry, fullbodied taste well-suited to baking and boiling; 'Anna Cheeka's Ozette' named for a Peruvian tribe; and 'Butte,' unusually high in both vitamin C and protein. Readers can choose the best keepers, broilers, bakers, mashers, fryers, steamers and roasters to cultivate.Finally, an extensive Sources section lists local and mail-order potato purveyors, vendors of potato paraphernalia and organic gardening supplies, potato councils, boards, associations and even a potato museum!Sure to appeal to both the potato gardener and the cook, The Potato Garden should be on every spud lover's shelf.",
