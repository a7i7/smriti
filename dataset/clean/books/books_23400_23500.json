        "Description": "Meet spirited Queenie Davilov in her first appearance on the mystery scene. A struggling screenwriter who moonlights doing security checks on the Hollywood film community, she's clever and wry, with an indefatigable sense of curiosity. She's a woman with a taste for Jack Daniels and her own hand-rolled cigarettes, who isn't superstitious but keeps a Goddess icon or two around the house, \"just in case.\"When Queenie attends the premiere of Lucifer's Shadow, a horror film she worked on as the script supervisor, she breathes a sigh of relief that filming is finally over. A suicide and the accidental deaths of two of the movie's crew plagued its production, setting nerves on edge and Hollywood's gossip columnists agog. Now, as the lights dim and the cinematic horrors unfold onscreen, the specter of death once again intrudes offscreen when producer/director Burke Lymon is spectacularly murdered, in a manner worthy of his own creation.As Hollywood reels in an atmosphere of terror and suspicion, Queenie is hired to find the demonic killer. Who wanted Lymon dead, anyway - and why? Rumor had it his production company was failing, but was that reason enough for murder? Or did an obsessed and greedy insider plan the crime to make the movie's popularity \"go ballistic\"? And what about skeletons in the secretive director's murky past? Queenie must use all her wits to save the next intended victim - before he or she falls within Lucifer's shadow.",

The kidnappers demand ten million dollars for his life - with one condition: The money is to come from the bank, not Aaron's parents. But the bank refuses to pay.Suddenly, Aaron is the quiet eye in the center of a hurricane of public outrage that sweeps the nation. On call-in shows and on every street corner, the same questions are being asked: Where is Aaron? Who could possibly be responsible for this? What is being done by the authorities? And the most important question of all: How much is the life of a nonentity like Aaron Greene really worth?",

First an armistice with Russia, and then the mass production of jet fighters, making an offensive against the West not just a chance for victory, but a sure thing.The lines are drawn. New plans are made . . . and the campaign is on, leading to a very different Battle of the Bulge, where the legendary \"Desert Fox\" Erwin Rommel meets \"Blood 'n' Guts\" George Patton in a confrontation that will determine the fate of Europe and quite possibly the entire free world.",

        "Description": "Frankenstein was Mary Shelley's immensely powerful contribution to the ghost stories which she, Percy Shelley, and Byron devised one wet summer in Switzerland. Its protagonist is a young student of natural philosophy, who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from relics of the dead, with horrific consequences.Frankenstein confronts some of the most feared innovations of evolutionism: topics such as degeneracy, hereditary disease, and mankind's status as a species of animal. The text used here is from the 1818 edition, which is a mocking expose' of leaders and achievers who leave desolation in their wake, showing humanity its choice - to live co-operatively or to die of selfishness.Drawing on new research, Marilyn Butler examines the novel in the context of the radical sciences, which were developing among much controversy, and shows how Frankenstein's experiment relates to a contemporary debate between the champions of materialist science and of received religion.",

An updated and considerably revised version of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion and Galatea, the 20th-century story pokes fun at the antiquated British class system. In Shaw's clever adaptation, Professor Henry Higgins, a linguistic expert, takes on a bet that he can transform an awkward cockney flower seller into a refined young lady simply by polishing her manners and changing the way she speaks. In the process of convincing society that his creation is a mysterious royal figure, the Professor also falls in love with his elegant handiwork.The irresistible theme of the emerging butterfly, together with Shaw's brilliant dialogue and splendid skills as a playwright, have made Pygmalion one of the most popular comedies in the English language. A staple of college drama courses, it is still widely performed.",

Like every other child born in the hopelessness of apartheid, he learned to measure his life in days, not years. Yet Mark Mathabane, armed only with the courage of his family and a hard-won education, raised himself up from the squalor and humiliation to win a scholarship to an American university.  This extraordinary memoir of life under apartheid is a triumph of the human spirit over hatred and unspeakable degradation.

After a third of the season the Knicks' record was a remarkable 25-2, including an eighteen-game winning streak. They would win going away.But the play-offs were another story: the Knicks had to overcome a feisty Baltimore Bullets team, a Milwaukee Bucks squad led by rookie sensation Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), and the tough, tough Los Angeles Lakers, with Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, and Jerry West.

        "Description": "King of the ring and king of the grill, George Foreman joins forces with chef Barbara Witt to provide all-new dishes for grill and rotisserie cooking. The recipes in this book can be prepared indoors, using an electric or stovetop grill; or outdoors, on an electric, charcoal, or gas-powered barbecue.  Grilling is healthful and quick. If you do a little work in advance, once you fire up the grill, dinner can be ready in a matter of minutes. So dishes like Rib Roast with Rosemary and Roasted-Garlic Wine Sauce, Chicken Breasts with Peanut Sauce, Ginger Honey Duck, and Curried Salmon Steak become easy weeknight dinners instead of party fare.  Foreman and Witt have created delicious recipes for grilled meats, poultry, seafood, vegetables, innovative grilled salads and pasta sauces -- even pizza. Complete with full nutritional information, the recipes reflect an international range of flavors -- Caribbean, Pan-Asian, and Latin -- and provide new twists on all-American favorites. In the recipe introductions and in the vegetable chapter, there are suggestions for side dishes, some of which can be prepared on the grill alongside the main course.  You'll find everything you need to know about equipment; ways to maximize flavor by using seasoning rubs, pastes, marinades, and brines; and there are sources for the best meats and ingredients. While these dishes are full of big flavors, the ingredients can be found in any well-stocked supermarket. Whether you want a quick-fix family meal, a backyard barbecue feast, or an elegant dinner party, you'll find the perfect recipe in George Foreman's Big Book of Grilling, Barbecue, and Rotisserie.",

        "Description": "Whether she is a corporate executive or a factory worker, an entrepreneur or a \"mompreneur,\" today's woman is an integral part of the workforce and the American Dream. Women have made inroads in many professions that were once the domain of only men while juggling the many demands of work and family. From the woman who manages a staff of fifty, to the mother who choreographs the comings and goings of a family of five, women are the ultimate multitaskers. This collection celebrates the diversity and special contributions of women in the world of work-their hopes, their dreams and aspirations, and their accomplishments.This very special book also acknowledges the important and often unappreciated women in the homeplace through stories of stay-at-home moms for whom raising children was their most important task. These tales recognize the vital contributions of women who find their reward in devoting their lives to their families instead of collecting a paycheck.Chapters include: All in a Day's Work; Balancing Work and Family; Teamwork; Special Moments, and more, and each shares the trials of working women and the special joys that achieving career dreams can bring. Readers will laugh, cry and nod in agreement as they connect with women who are not just making a living, but making a life.",

The vivid narrative centers on the experience of a hypothetical father and son in need of spiritual and physical assistance. The author combines the Yuwipi ceremony with two ancient Sioux rituals often performed in conjunction with it, the vision quest and the sweat lodge. Wayne Runs Again, suffering from alcoholism and worried about his father\u2019s health, seeks out a shaman who, while bound in darkness, calls on supernatural beings to free him and to communicate. While the young man undergoes purification in a sweat lodge and waits on a hill for a vision, the community prays for him and his father. The ceremony serves not only to cure the sick but also to reaffirm the continuity of Oglala society.",

        "Description": "How young is too young to talk with children about sex and reproduction? Are we clear as adults about the meaning of the words \"sex\" and \"sexuality,\" or \"gender\" and \"sexual orientation\"? Do we know what we want our children to think and value about sexuality, and how to combat unhealthy cultural influences?With a rare directness and clarity about these profoundly important issues, nationally recognized sexuality educator Deborah Roffman challenges and teaches readers to develop a blueprint for opening the lines of communication with children of all ages. Raising sexually healthy children requires that we master what Roffman identifies as five core parenting skills: we must affirm our children's emerging sexuality; provide accurate sexual information; demonstrate the connection between values and action; set safe and healthy limits; and provide constant and effective anticipatory guidance. Powerfully instructive on how to talk in ways that will be meaningful to kids, Sex and Sensibility will help parents confidently interpret and comfortably respond to virtually any question a child might pose or any situation that arises.",

        "Title": "Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet",
        "Authors": "By Wolff, Michael",
        "Description": "For much of the 1990s, starting up a business on the Internet offered young go-getters with a taste for risk the fastest route to glittering prosperity. Our light-speed economy has made possible a new American dream, to take an idea overnight from the kitchen table to hundreds of millions of dollars in market value. But the desperate Internet entrepreneur knows every day, every night -- that the chances of success and survival dwindle at the same rate as the cash evaporates. Make the right deals, announce the right products at the right time, and the investors will beat down your doors with money. Falter, and the venture capitalists will eat you alive.  Michael Wolff was one of the first to see the potential of the Internet and one of the pioneers of new media. As he labored to build his own company, Wolff, a former journalist, knew he had stumbled on the seminal business story of the 1990s. Burn Rate is about the heart-in-your-throat struggles of being an entrepreneur. It is about witnessing an industry being born: the founding of Wired magazine, the launch of Time Warner's much-touted Pathfinder, the conflict between content centered on the East Coast and technology on the West Coast, the rise of the search engines, the dominance and dysfunctionality of America Online, and the thud of Microsoft stumbling and falling down on the Net.  In the precarious world of the Internet, where income is a rosy projection and profit little more than a hope and a prayer, a company is no better than the confidence it radiates to its potential partners. After the freewheeling early years of the World Wide Web, the financial prospects of fledgling Web businesses collectively dropped in one stunning month when Wired, the most famous Internet company, failed to launch its stock. Wolff found himself at the head of a rapidly expanding company with seven weeks of capital remaining, trapped between the insatiable needs of his business and the chilling machinations of his investors. With the clock ticking, his only hope was to strike a winning deal.  With mordant wit, Burn Rate portrays life on the bleeding edge of capitalism -- a realm where your savior, the venture capitalist, may also be your undoing. A Faustian figure, the venture capitalist reveals to Michael Wolff the secret workings of business, as well as the human dimensions of how companies are made, bought, and sold. But the price he asks in return is steep. He never risks too much of his own money but makes sure that he will profit best and first from the entrepreneur's work.  As Wolff builds his business, you'll get to know the geeks, billionaires, weasels, and, of course, visionaries he meets along the way. Louis Rossetto, the unemployed expat who creates Wired. Walter Isaacson, the prince of Time Warner, who throws the resources of America's largest media company behind the Web. The boy investor, the \"dumb money\" who backs Wolff's company. Halsey Minor, the executive recruiter who founds a publishing empire on the Net. The CMP boys, the computer magazine publishers who are desperate to get into the Internet game. Robert Maxwell's children, whose high-flying company is one of the first bubbles to burst on the Internet. Even Barry Biller, who advises Wolff that getting in on the ground floor is good only if you're still standing in the end.  Wolff discovers, much to his own consternation, that his work, inspiration, and imagination entitle him to no more than a minor share of his own company's potential wealth. And, in the end,",

        "Title": "Kiplinger's Looking Ahead 70 Years of Forecasts from the Kiplinger Washington Letter",
        "Authors": "By Shay, Susan Ten Abby",
        "Description": "Stock market crashes in '29 and '87. World war in Europe and Asia. The Baby Boom. Television. Office computers. Automated manufacturing. Migration to the Sun Belt. The economic rise of Japan. VCRs. Booming world trade and investment. ATMs. Environmental activism. Fax machines. Stock market surge in the '80s. Soaring budget deficits. Equal-opportunity revolution. Corporate downsizing. Collapse of the Soviet empire.Before these events, inventions and trends - so familiar to us today - became history, they were the future. No one was fully prepared for them, but regular readers of The Kiplinger Washington Letter were less surprised than most people. That's because all these developments, and dozens more of similar significance, were foreshadowed in weekly issues of the Kiplinger Letter, the oldest and most widely read forecasting publication in the world.Kiplinger's Looking Ahead presents a compilation of hundreds of excerpted forecasts from 70 years of the Letter. In these pages, you'll find example after example of bold, informed predictions made months and even years ahead of the final outcome. Of course, no forecaster has a flawless record, so you'll find a fair number of miscalls, too, ranging from the election of Thomas Dewey in '48 to periodic predictions of Fidel Castro's imminent overthrow.Kiplinger's Looking Ahead is much more than a collection of forecasts and judgments. It's also a unique journey through the last seven decades, a period of accelerating change in America and the world. In its pages you'll witness the gradual transformation of an insular America into the greatest superpower of a global economy.There's much truth in the saying \"the more things change, the more they remain the same,\" so there will be a familiar ring to many items from earlier times - discussions of an overly complex tax code in the 1920s, fear of soaring imports from Japan in the '30s and '50s and the tendency of democracies to habitually exceed government budgets.To appreciate accurate forecasting in decades past, you'll need to recall what actually happened, and when. To refresh your memory, each decade chapter of Kiplinger's Looking Ahead opens with a lively narrative highlighting major events and trends. Timelines mark some of the cultural and social milestones that paralleled the economic trends tracked by Kiplinger.Hundreds of photographs and political cartoons truly bring the text selections to life, illustrating what Americans experienced and what they - and the general media - through about events as they happened.Every issue of The Kiplinger Washington Letter focuses on the future, so this book wouldn't be an accurate representation if it pointed the telescope only backward. The last chapter of the book, highlighting Letter excerpts from the first years of the '90s, offers many intriguing Kiplinger forecasts of what to expect between now and the year 2000.",

Did Richard III really kill \u201cthe Princes in the Tower,\u201d as is commonly believed, or was the murderer someone else entirely? Carefully examining every shred of contemporary evidence as well as dozens of modern accounts, Alison Weir reconstructs the entire chain of events leading to the double murder. We are witnesses to the rivalry, ambition, intrigue, and struggle for power that culminated in the imprisonment of the princes and the hushed-up murders that secured Richard\u2019s claim to the throne as Richard III. A masterpiece of historical research and a riveting story of conspiracy and deception, The Princes in the Tower at last provides a solution to this age-old puzzle.",

        "Description": "In a society where \"upward mobility\" is the highest goal, Bill Hybels asks a tough question: Do Christians place God's desires first-or their own? In Descending into Greatness, Hybels and writer Rob Wilkins take the example of Christ's downward journey as it was meant to be; the radical and essential answer for every Christian. In fourteen powerful chapters, the authors explore such topics as How Jesus managed power. The intentional decisions necessary to move down. The uplifting nature of true humility. Abundant life through dying to self. The ambush of joy. Moving down is never an easy matter that can be reduced to a formula. It involves a life committed to discipleship. Descending into Greatness introduces you to the touching stories of modern men and women committed to advancing the kingdom of God: from the pro football player, to the medical missionary, to a businessman wrestling with the priorities in the world of finance. Descending into Greatness asks tough questions and gives hopeful answers. Now, this powerful, urgent message also includes a discussion guide so that you can follow through, too. \"Like Christ, we must descend-into self-abandonment, unconditional giving, sacrifice, and death to self. And, like Christ, we will then ascend-into fulfillment, blessing, joy, and purpose.\"",

A pithy book of wise business musings from the bard,  Shakespeare On Management captures entertaining and uncannily accurate reflections on fifty-six of the most popular topics in business today, from mergers and acquisitions to office politics, power lunches to public relations. Think of  Hamlet, the poignant case of too-sensitive young executive who fails to move up the corporate ladder because of his inability to make decisions. Or  Julius Caesar, which at its heart is nothing of not an attempt at a hostile takeover by disgruntled stockholders. Or consider  King Lear, a warning to all executives of family businesses the perils of divestiture and early retirement.  Smart, thought-provoking, and astonishingly contemporary,  Shakespeare On Management is truly a time-tested classic that belongs on every well-read executive's bookshelf.",

Locust, once a producing plantation and inn on Mississippi's Natchez Trace Parkway and now a tourist spot, the last thing she expects to encounter is murder. But the man Anna finds in the stand's old bedroom is no tourist in distress. He's nearly naked, and very dead, his body bearing marks consistent with an S&M ritual gone awry. On a writing table nearby is an open Bible, ominous passages circled in red.  It seems the deceased is the brother of Raymond Barnette, local undertaker and a candidate for sheriff, who wants to keep any hint of kinkiness out of the minds of the God-fearing populace. Ray may be hiding a house full of secrets in the old family homestead, but before Anna can start her investigation, she's waylaid by malevolent poachers, peevish coworkers, and a suddenly turbulent romantic life. And when hidden agendas and old allegiances are revealed, it's suddenly Anna's life that's on the line.  Tightly plotted, brilliantly suspenseful, and beautifully written, Hunting Season offers solid evidence that mankind can be as unpredictable and dangerous as the great outdoors.",
