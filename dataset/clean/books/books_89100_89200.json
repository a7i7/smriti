        "Authors": "By Shaw, Randy",
        "Description": "\"Anybody researching or writing anything about contemporary U.S. political life should be familiar with The Activist's Handbook. Anybody attempting to influence local, state, or national political decisions needs it desperately. Politicians may read it and tremble a bit. For that matter, the rich and powerful will probably read it to see how smart some of their enemies are becoming.\"--Ernest Callenbach, author of Ecotopia\"Provides rare insight into the strategies and tactics environmentalists must use if they are to succeed in today's political climate. A must read.\"--Barbara Dudley, Executive Director, Greenpeace\"This is a unique book, wise, realistic, and enormously valuable for anyone interested in social change. It is practical in its advice, and inspiring in its stories of ordinary people successfully confronting powerful interests.\"--Howard Zinn, author of A People's History of the United States\"The Activist's Handbook could not have come at a more opportune time. In an era when poverty is growing and national social programs are threatened, the Handbook is an invaluable tool for community groups wishing to mobilize efforts in the service of escalating human needs.\"--Ben Bagdikian, author of The Media Monopoly and Double Vision\"Randy Shaw gives us a serious and respectful treatment of the strategic problems and opportunities that confront grassroots activists. This is a dimension of contemporary politics that is rarely treated, and welcome for that reason. Moreover, in developing his analysis, Shaw draws on numerous cases of local struggles to remind us of what the media has come to ignore, the persistent and insuppressible popular activism that is part of American political life.\"--Frances Fox Piven, City University of New York\"The Activist's Handbook lives up to its title and will likely join the company of organizing classics. It is the kind of book that should be on every activist's reading list.\"--Chris Ney, Nonviolent activist",

        "Description": "From the author of the now-classic Resource Wars, an indispensable account of how the world's diminishing sources of energy are radically changing the international balance of power Recently, an unprecedented Chinese attempt to acquire the major American energy firm Unocal was blocked by Congress amidst hysterical warnings of a Communist threat. But the political grandstanding missed a larger point: the takeover bid was a harbinger of a new structure of world power, based not on market forces or on arms and armies but on the possession of vital natural resources. Surveying the energy-driven dynamic that is reconfiguring the international landscape, Michael Klare, the preeminent expert on resource geopolitics, forecasts a future of surprising new alliances and explosive danger. World leaders are now facing the stark recognition that all materials vital for the functioning of modern industrial societies (not just oil and natural gas but uranium, coal, copper, and others) are finite and being depleted at an ever-accelerating rate. As a result, governments rather than corporations are increasingly spearheading the pursuit of resources. In a radically altered world-- where Russia is transformed from battered Cold War loser to arrogant broker of Eurasian energy, and the United States is forced to compete with the emerging \"Chindia\" juggernaut--the only route to survival on a shrinking planet, Klare shows, lies through international cooperation.",

        "Authors": "By Schenker, David Kenneth",
        "Description": "Democratization has long been a poor cousin to Arab-Israeli peacemaking and Gulf security in the list of U.S. policy priorities in the Middle East. Far too little attention has been devoted to the authoritarian state-in-the-making in the West Bank and Gaza and its implications for the sustainability of peace between Israelis and the Palestinians. The analytical questions at the heart of the issue are: Would a democratic Palestinian Authority be better or worse for the peace process? And just how important is democracy to a lasting peace between Israelis and the Palestinians?In Palestinian Democracy and Governance, David Schenker provides an assessment by looking through the prism of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislative branch of government in the Palestinian Authority. The PLC, he argues,  is the bellwether of democracy in the PA. This path-breaking study should not only provoke debate on a highly sensitive yet vitally important issue, but also prod American policymakers to consider new and creative ways to invest in the long-term potential for democratization in the Palestinian Authority.",

        "Title": "Heads, Features and Faces (Dover Anatomy for Artists)",
        "Authors": "By Bridgman, George Brant",
        "Description": "Certainly one of the most difficult, often neglected areas of art study is the correct rendering of heads, features, and faces. This volume, prepared by an expert in the field, is devoted exclusively to just that. With its clear, concise text, its almost 200 excellent illustrations, and its overall life-drawing approach, the book provides valuable guidelines on how best to portray faces, features, and heads. There is probably no better instructor to turn to than George B. Bridgman. He brings to the subject both his expertise as an artist and his fifty years' experience as lecturer and teacher at the Art Students League of New York. Throughout the book, he places as much emphasis on perspective and planes as on anatomy. In this way, you'll\u00a0develop a more precise understanding of each feature, the head and face in general, the relationship between features, and the relationship between a specific feature and the face or head. Mr. Bridgman's consideration of the head includes such topics as the head at eye level and below eye level; planes of the head; and\u00a0round and square forms.\u00a0Four features \u2014 eye, nose, mouth, ear \u2014 are dealt with in detail. Sections on light and shade, comparative measurements, and principles of cube and oval construction further enhance the scope of the book. The finely executed drawings complement the textual material, illustrating all\u00a0important concepts. \u00a0Of special value is the author's inclusion of the work of famous portrait artists. Vermeer, Hals, Rembrandt, Reynolds, Louise Elisabeth LeBrun \u2014 these are the people who made portraiture a master art; and you'll be able to study, up close and at your leisure, the qualities that let their work achieve the status it did.",

Instead, she has devoted her time to running the Fortune Family Foundation, a revered philanthropic institution that has helped spark the careers of many a budding writer, including Max Wellman, Jane's first\u2014and only\u2014love.

Today the Continent is still littered with salacious remnants of that golden age, where secret boudoirs, notorious dungeons, and forbidden artifacts lured travelers all the way from London to Capri.\u00a0In The Sinner\u2019s Grand Tour, celebrated historian and travel writer Tony Perrottet sets off to discover a string of legendary sites and relics that are still kept far from public view. In southern France, an ancient text leads him inside the ch\u00e2teau of the Marquis de Sade, now owned by fashion icon Pierre Cardin. In Paris, an 1883 prostitute guide helps him discover the Belle \u00e9poque fantasy brothel Le Chabanais and the lost \u201csex chair\u201d of King Edward VII. Renaissance documents in the Vatican Secret Archives point the way to the Pope\u2019s very own apartments in Vatican City, wherein lies the fabled Stufetta del Bibbiena, a pornography-covered bathroom painted by Raphael in 1516.\u00a0 With his unique blend of original research, sharp wit, and hilarious anecdotes, Perrottet brings us a romping travel adventure through the scandalous backrooms of historical Europe.",

At least not by anyone who knew what he was doing. Hola\u2019s supposed master, Marty, is a high-functioning alcoholic. A TV writer turned management consultant, Marty\u2019s in debt and out of shape; he\u2019s about to lose his job, and one day he emerges from a haze of peach-flavored vodka to find he\u2019s on the verge of losing his wife, Gloria, too, if he can\u2019t get his life\u2014and his dog\u2014under control.  Desperately trying to save his marriage, Marty throws himself headlong into the world of competitive dog training. Unfortunately, he knows even less than Hola, the only dog ever to be expelled from her puppy preschool twice. Somehow, together, they need to get through the American Kennel Club\u2019s rigorous Canine Good Citizen test. Of course, Hola first needs to learn how to sit.  It won\u2019t be easy.

Now, in This Time Together, Carol really lets her hair down and tells one funny or touching or memorable story after another. \u00a0In engaging anecdotes, Carol discusses her remarkable friendships with stars such at Jimmy Stewart, Lucille Ball, Cary Grant, and Julie Andrews; the background behind famous scenes, like the moment she swept down the stairs in her curtain-rod dress in the legendary \u201cWent With the Wind\u201d skit; and things that would happen only to Carol--the prank with Julie Andrews that went wrong in front of the First Lady; the famous Tarzan Yell that saved her during a mugging; and the time she faked a wooden leg to get served in a famous ice cream emporium. This poignant look back allows us to cry with the actress during her sorrows, rejoice in her successes, and finally, always, to laugh.",

        "Description": "\"When the Templeton family takes up residence in an imposing and long-empty manor in the countryside of Victoria, Australia, the locals begin to buzz with gossip. The seven Templetons moved from England and seem unusual, peculiar even--especially when they begin to lead tours through the stately home while dressed in period costume. No one is more intrigued by the family than their neighbors, single mother Nina Donovan and her son, Tom. Though they try to keep their distance from the often shocking Templeton dramas, Nina and Tom find their lives unexpectedly entwined with this enigmatic family, much to the delight of Gracie, the youngest Templeton daughter. Then one day, a tragedy tears them all apart. In the grand estate, the stage is set for years of betrayal and heartbreak, love and affection, to be revealed--and, perhaps, resolved--as the Templetons try to make amends. At Home with the Templetons is Monica McInerney's best book yet--a captivating and moving story that spans two decades, illuminating the perils and pleasures of love, friendship, and family.

In this inspiration-packed book, Katie Couric reports from the front lines of the worlds of politics, entertainment, sports, philanthropy, the arts, and business\u2014distilling the ingenious, hard-won insights of leaders and visionaries, who tell us all how to take chances, follow our passions, cope with criticism, and, perhaps most important, commit to something greater than ourselves.Among the many voices to be heard here are financial guru Suze Orman on the benefits of doing what\u2019s right, not what\u2019s easy; director Steven Spielberg on listening rather than being listened to; quarterback Drew Brees on how his (literal) big break changed his life; and novelist Curtis Sittenfeld on the secrets of a great long-term relationship (she suggests marrying someone less neurotic than you); not to mention:\u2022 Michael Bloomberg: \u201cEighty percent of success is showing up . . . early.\u201d\u2022 Eric Stonestreet: \u201cRemember that the old lady who\u2019s taking forever in line is someone\u2019s grandma.\u201d\u2022 Joyce Carol Oates: \u201cRead widely\u2014what you want to read, and not what someone suggests that you should read.\u201d\u2022 Jimmy Kimmel: \u201cWhen in doubt, order the hamburger.\u2019\u201d\u2022 Apolo Ohno: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the forty seconds; it\u2019s about the four years, the time it took to get there.\u201d\u2022 Madeleine K.

She reveals how the words of Thomas Jefferson helped her deal with her husband\u2019s tragic death from cancer, and what encouraged her to leave the security of NBC\u2019s Today show for a new adventure at CBS.Delightful, empowering, and moving, The Best Advice I Ever Got is the perfect book for anyone who is thinking about the future, contemplating taking a risk, or daring to make a leap into the great unknown.

After thirteen years of marriage, he still can\u2019t imagine a remotely happy life without her\u2014yet he obsessively contemplates her demise. Soon she is dead, and David is both deeply distraught and the prime suspect.The detectives investigating Alice\u2019s suspicious death have plenty of personal experience with conjugal enigmas: Ward Hastroll is happily married until his wife inexplicably becomes voluntarily and militantly bedridden; and Sam Sheppard is especially sensitive to the intricacies of marital guilt and innocence, having decades before been convicted and then exonerated of the brutal murder of his wife. Like the Escher drawings that inspire the computer games David designs for a living, these complex, interlocking dramas are structurally and emotionally intense, subtle, and intriguing; they brilliantly explore the warring impulses of affection and hatred, and pose a host of arresting questions. Is it possible to know anyone fully, completely? Are murder and marriage two sides of the same coin, each endlessly recycling into the other? And what, in the end, is the truth about love?",

        "Authors": "By Hazlett-Stevens, Holly and Craske, Michelle G. (INT)",
        "Description": "Women are more likely than men to develop anxiety disorders, a fact which researchers have attributed to a range of biological, psychological, and cultural factors. This predispostion inclines women to worry more than men about things like social problems, work, finances-even about worry itself, a phenomenon psychologists call meta-worry. The goal of this book is to help readers control excessive worry by learning to perceive threats more accurately and to stop focusing on things that are unlikely to happen.Following an introduction by noted psychologist Michelle Craske that explores the reasons women worry more than men, the book addresses the fundamentals of worry: what it is, how it differs from anxiety, and how it can develop into a chronic state of mind. The book offers strategies for overcoming worry that include monitoring personal worry triggers, breaking worry-provoking habits, and avoiding avoidance-a major aggravating factor for all anxiety disorders. From it, you'll learn to use mindfulness techniques to avoid ruminating on the past or the future and how to use progressive relaxation to cope with worrisome situations.",

        "Description": "In this collection of essays, some of the world's leading anthropologists explore fundamental questions humans ask about themselves as individuals, as societies, and as a species, Conveying anthropology's richness and breadth, the contributors trace the emergence of humans from other primates, describe archaeologists' understanding of early and more recent settlements, and explore the diversity of present and past cultures. Moving from a discussion of communications with apes to a survey of the aging process in several societies, from a case study of a Peruvian highland community to a search for the origins of Eskimo peoples, the essays trace not only culture changes but also changes in anthropologists' perspectives during the 150-year history of the field.",

        "Description": "Essential strategies to keep children and teens safe onlineAs our children and teens race down the onramp to the InformationSuperhighway, many parents feel left behind in the dust. Newsstories about online sexual predators, child pornography,cyberbullies, hate groups, gaming addiction, and other dangers thatlurk in the online world make us feel increasingly concerned aboutwhat our children are doing (and with whom) in cyberspace.

Aschildren grow, we help them gain the knowledge, skills, and valuesto make good choices--choices that will keep them safe and showrespect for the rights of others. In Cyber-Safe Kids, Cyber-SavvyTeens, Willard shows you how those same strategies can betranslated from the real world to the cyberworld, and that youdon't have to learn advanced computer skills to put them intoeffect. As you work on these strategies with your child, you willalso discover that remaining engaged with what your children aredoing online is much more valuable than any blocking software youcould buy.\"Willard blends the perspectives of a wise parent and a seriousscholar about issues related to Internet behavior and safety. . . .Pick up the book, open it to any random page, and you will find onthat page or nearby a wealth of helpful advice and usefulcommentary on the cyberreality facing our children and on how todeal with any of the issues she's identified.\"--Dick Thornburgh, J.D., former U.S. Attorney General; chair,National Academy of Sciences Committee on Youth Pornography and theInternet\"Simply put, this book is a must-read for anyone--parents,educators, law enforcement, and policymakers alike--concerned withthe critical issue of children's internet safety and what to doabout it.\"--Douglas Levin, senior director of education policy, Cable in theClassroom",

        "Title": "How Not to Play Chess (Dover Chess)",
        "Authors": "By Znosko-Borovsky, Eugene and Reinfeld, Fred (EDT)",
        "Description": "Beginners and even fairly advanced players agree on one thing: analyzing the strength or weakness of a position (material being equal) is the hardest part of chess to learn. It is also one of the hardest elements to teach, and there are some who claim it is unteachable. But this wonderfully lucid book, written by one of the outstanding chess expositors of the twentieth century, presents the basis of analysis in such a disarmingly simple way that even the most casual player will be able to improve his game immensely.Sticking to a few well-chosen examples and explaining every step along the way, the author shows you how to avoid playing a hit-or-miss game, from move to move, and instead develop general plans of action based on positional analysis: weak and strong squares, the notion of controlling a square, how to seize control of open lines, weak points in the pawn structure, and other aspects of analysis.He includes as well a number of tips (not often found in books for beginners and average players) that the reader would do well to commit to memory: such hints as \u201cNever omit to blockade an enemy passed pawn,\u201d and \u201cDo not be content with attacking an existing weakness; always seek to create others.\u201d Throughout the book he defines and illustrates typical chess mistakes, and anyone reading his book carefully will learn in a few hours what he might otherwise have spent years to attain. For this revised edition, the author added 20 problems from master games on which the reader can test his understanding of the principles found in the text.",

A Venetian poet of the 1500s, another storyteller, is introduced to a modern traveler reading Rilke. His story precedes a mesmerizing narrative of missionaries in China. In the final story, Giles, born to a priesthood family, leans toward Buddhism after a grievous loss, and in time falls in love with the dancer of the first story. So deft and subtle is Joan Silber with these various perspectives that we come full circle surprised and enchanted by her myriad worlds. National Book Award finalist. Reading group guide included.",
