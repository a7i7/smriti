        "Description": "Ben Shamas has spent the five years since the accidental drowning of his daughter in a carefully circumscribed routine. Between long hours of work at his law practice and the occasional quiet weekend bender, he has managed to avoid thinking about his daughter, his failed marriage, or his future. Then events break in on his comfortable numbness.Ben's oldest friend, Bobby Parrish, asks him to help run his campaign for the U.S. Senate, in what promises to be a bitter contest against a ruthless opponent. Ben's involvement in the campaign draws him out of his emotional shell, but as the heat of the campaign becomes intense, this brings on different dangers.Bobby's wife, Laura, was Ben's first love. As she turns to Ben for the attention Bobby has single-mindedly focused on the campaign, Ben is brought face to face with the past he has been ignoring, with his sense of loss and roads not taken. Meanwhile, the opposition has been digging into Bobby's personal history in search of anything they can use against him. What they find - and how Ben responds - could not only end Bobby's political career, but change the lives of all three friends forever.",

Brought in to investigate the disappearance by James J. Hill, St. Paul's most powerful man and a close friend of young Upton's father, Holmes and Watson soon make a horrific discovery that uncovers a flurry of clues, all distractingly opaque. Why did Upton's fiancee give back her bridal dress? What dark secrets lurk behind the comfortable facade of the Muskrat Club, where the young swells of St. Paul gather to drink and gamble? Who is the brilliant \"Spider\" at the center of the affair? And does the ice palace itself hold the key to the ghastly secret within its gleaming walls?In this fiendishly complex case, Holmes finds himself taxed to the limit - and is quite surprised when a local saloonkeeper, a large-hearted and cunning Irishman with a devilish sense of humor, beats him to a clue. But, as Holmes seen discovers, no one knows St. Paul - and everyone in it - as well as Shadwell Rafferty, and the two develop enormous, though at times begrudging respect for each other. Soon one must save the other from death's door, as they brave the Mississippi River's frigid waters and confront the villain amid the roar of rockets, in one of the most thrilling episodes \"Watson\" ever committed to paper.",

        "Description": "Edward B. Hanna brings Sherlock Holmes stunningly back to life in this homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's great creation. The Whitechapel Horrors, with its spellbinding story and atmospheric prose, is the best new Holmes adventure since Seven-Per-Cent Solution. Here Hanna imagines the characters anew, while maintaining the integrity of Conan Doyle's originals.Grotesque murders are being committed on the streets of Whitechapel. Sherlock Holmes comes to believe the murders are the skillful work of one man, a man who earns the gruesome epithet of Jack the Ripper. As the investigation proceeds, Holmes realizes that the true identity of the Ripper puts much more at stake than merely catching a killer - the most fundamental British institutions may very well be threatened. He is faced with the most difficult decision he has ever made, a crisis of conscience that shakes him to his very core. Holmes must decide where his allegiance truly lies - with his code of honor as a detective and champion of justice, or with his strong feelings of patriotism and love of England.Hanna vividly evokes the atmosphere of Victorian London in all its great and sordid details: the gaslight lamps and hansom cabs, the rain in the streets, the smell of poverty, the people and their language, dress, and habits. The Whitechapel Horrors is vintage Holmes, a ripping good mystery worthy of the great detective and his eminent creator. You're sure to feel as though you are in the actual presence of the great sleuth, himself, and you will delight in this wonderful addition to the Watson chronicles.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States",
        "Authors": "By Hall, Kermit L., Ely, James W., and Grossman, Joel B. (EDT)",
        "Description": "In Democracy in America, De Tocqueville observed that there is hardly a political question in the United States which does not sooner or later turn into a judicial one. Two hundred years of American history have certainly born out the truth of this remark. Whether a controversy is political, economic, or social, whether it focuses on child labor, slavery, prayer in public schools, war powers, busing, abortion, business monopolies, or capital punishment, eventually the battle is taken to court. And the ultimate venue for these vital struggles is the Supreme Court. Indeed, the Supreme Court is a prism through which the entire life of our nation is magnified and illuminated, and through which we have defined ourselves as a people.    Now, in The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States, readers have a rich source of information about one of the central institutions of American life. Everything one would want to know about the Supreme Court is here, in more than a thousand alphabetically arranged entries. There are biographies of every justice who ever sat on the Supreme Court (with pictures of each) as well as entries on rejected nominees and prominent judges (such as Learned Hand), on presidents who had an important impact on--or conflict with--the Court (including Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt), and on other influential figures (from Alexander Hamilton to Cass Gilbert, the architect of the Supreme Court Building). More than four hundred entries examine every major case that the court has decided, from Marbury v. Madison (which established the Court's power to declare federal laws unconstitutional) and Scott v. Sandford (the Dred Scott Case) to Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade.  In addition, there are extended essays on the major issues that have confronted the Court (from slavery to national security, capital punishment to religion, from affirmative action to the Vietnam War), entries on judicial matters and legal terms (ranging from judicial review and separation of powers to amicus brief and habeas corpus), articles on all Amendments to the Constitution, and an extensive, four-part history of the Court. And as in all Oxford Companions, the contributors combine scholarship with engaging insight, giving us a sense of the personality and the inner workings of the Court. They examine everything from the wanderings of the Supreme Court (the first session was held on the second floor of the Royal Exchange Building in New York City, and the Court at times has met in a Congressional committee room, a tavern, a rented house, and finally, in 1935, its own building), to the Jackson-Black Feud and the clouded resignation of Abe Fortas, to the Supreme Court's press room and the paintings and sculptures adorning the Supreme Court building.     The decisions of the Supreme Court have touched--and will continue to influence--every corner of American society. A comprehensive, authoritative guide to the Supreme Court, this volume is an essential reference source for everyone interested in the workings of this vital institution and in the multitude of issues it has confronted over the course of its history.",

Here is a book that will allow you to laugh at yourself, and, more important, laugh at other people.Neil Steinberg happily explores the many fascinating facets of failure, and writes about them in unique if sometimes twisted ways. Here you will encounter the horrifying Dickensian ritual of the National Spelling Bee, how products like toaster eggs get on the market, the quest for the perfect Shiny New Bike, doomed brainiacs, slightly dim British mountaineers, the poor sap who really invented the telephone, the shocking truth about Isaac Newton, and many other interesting failures, famous and obscure. Along the way, Steinberg ruminates about his own myriad miscues and disappointments, beginning with his inability to perform a magic trick at age four (he blames Captain Kangaroo).Complete & Utter Failure is a wonderfully literate, witty book that issues a ringing message for our time: If at first you don't succeed... have a scotch and forget about it.",

        "Description": "Our world is shrinking fast: goods, money, microbes, pollution, people, and ideas are crossing borders with growing ease. National governments are ill-suited for tackling the problems that result, from climate change, to the soaring trade in limited resource commodities like timber, to the management of regional water supplies. Hilary French argues that the only long-term solution to our environmental problems is a worldwide commitment to strengthening the international treaties and institutions essential for integrating ecological considerations into the still-nascent rules of global commerce. More than two hundred international environmental treaties already exist, but few of them stipulate stringent commitments and effective enforcement; and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization continue to view environmental protection as a peripheral concern. But at the same time, new communications technologies are making it possible for nongovernmental organizations to mobilize powerful coalitions of private citizens to press for change, and some forward-thinking businesses have begun to support environmental codes of conduct and other international standards. Vanishing Borders provides people concerned about the future of the planet with a clear plan of action for ensuring environmental stability in the wake of globalization.",

He has gathered a mighty force to liberate the Greek cities of Asia -- from legendary Sardis and Miletus to Halicarnassus. But vengeance is just one of Alexander's ambitions. Great oracles and loyal followers claim Alexander is more than mortal -- a powerful warrior, and insatiable scholar, a political genius. Yet,in battle after battle, one man blocks his way. Memnon of Rhodes, a Greek-born mercenary chosen by the Persian Great King to lead his vast army, is a cunning strategist who challenged Alexander's claim to the title of Lord of Asia. In Memnon, Alexander confronts an enemy who inspires his admiration. And in Memnon's wife, Barsine, he finds a woman who captures his heart. But neither bravery nor love can stem the tide of Alexander's destiny. For with Persia defeated, Alexander's thoughts turn to Egypt and beyond...",

        "Title": "The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary",
        "Authors": "By Winchester, Simon",
        "Description": "From the best-selling author of The Professor and the Madman, The Map That Changed the World, and Krakatoa comes a truly wonderful celebration of the English language and of its unrivaled treasure house, the Oxford English Dictionary. Writing with marvelous brio, Winchester first serves up a lightning history of the English language--\"so vast, so sprawling, so wonderfully unwieldy\"--and pays homage to the great dictionary makers, from \"the irredeemably famous\" Samuel Johnson to the \"short, pale, smug and boastful\" schoolmaster from New Hartford, Noah Webster. He then turns his unmatched talent for story-telling to the making of this most venerable of dictionaries. In this fast-paced narrative, the reader will discover lively portraits of such key figures as the brilliant but tubercular first editor Herbert Coleridge (grandson of the poet), the colorful, boisterous Frederick Furnivall (who left the project in a shambles), and James Augustus Henry Murray, who spent a half-century bringing the project to fruition. Winchester lovingly describes the nuts-and-bolts of dictionary making--how unexpectedly tricky the dictionary entry for marzipan was, or how fraternity turned out so much longer and monkey so much more ancient than anticipated--and how bondmaid was left out completely, its slips found lurking under a pile of books long after the B-volume had gone to press. We visit the ugly corrugated iron structure that Murray grandly dubbed the Scriptorium--the Scrippy or the Shed, as locals called it--and meet some of the legion of volunteers, from Fitzedward Hall, a bitter hermit obsessively devoted to the OED, to W. C. Minor, whose story is one of dangerous madness, ineluctable sadness, and ultimate redemption. The Meaning of Everything is a scintillating account of the creation of the greatest monument ever erected to a living language. Simon Winchester's supple, vigorous prose illuminates this dauntingly ambitious project--a seventy-year odyssey to create the grandfather of all word-books, the world's unrivalled uber-dictionary.",

        "Description": "We all have our favorite pieces by our beloved writers. But what do they think is their own best work? Inspired by an acclaimed collection published in 1942, the editors at the Quality Paperback Book Club invited fiction writers, essayists, poets, playwrights, and cartoonists to choose and comment on their best work. The result is a veritable who's who of contemporary literature and popular culture, including selections by Anne Tyler, Arthur Miller, Gary Trudeau, David Sedaris, Rita Dove, Tom Robbins, Ruth Reichl, T. C. Boyle, Mary Karr, John Updike, and dozens more. Each selection is rewarding in itself; more still for the introductions in which the author explains his or her choice, shedding light on both the work and creative process. Appealing to readers of the annual best short story collections, writers, and fans of the stellar list of contributors, This Is My Best is a landmark literary anthology.",
