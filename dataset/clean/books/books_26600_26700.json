        "Title": "Legend & Legacy:  The Story of Boeing and Its People",
        "Authors": "By Serling, Robert J",
        "Description": "The name Boeing evokes vivid images, from the B-17 Flying Fortresses of World War II to the 707 and 747 jet transports that revolutionized air travel. Less well known: The Boeing Company built the first stage of the Saturn rocket that started men on the way to the moon, developed the Minuteman missile system, and is now designing America's space station. Boeing jets, in service around the globe, carry 675 million passengers annually--the equivalent of twelve percent of the world's population.Behind the statistics and the awe-inspiring aircraft is a company of paradoxes, a vast organization nimble enough to take daring market risks that have kept it at the top of its industry. Robert J. Serling, forty-five years an award-winning aviation writer, takes the reader behind the scenes with humor, objectivity, and abundant anecdotes: Boeing once went seventeen months without seeing a single domestic jetliner and came close to bankruptcy. One of its legendary test pilots unexpectedly barrel-rolled a prototype jetliner, into which the company had sunk one-quarter of its net worth, because he thought the stunt would help sell the airplane. Legend and Legacy, Robert J. Serling's most ambitious work to date, reads like a novel, complete with memorable characters who, despite occasional stumbles, helped win the war and conquer the commercial skies: The salesman who almost traded a used 727 for $12 million worth of underwear. The vice president who worked in a darkened office illuminated by a single, low-wattage light bulb. The gifted, driven engineers who did the impossible, by yesterday.Never in its seventy-five years has Boeing been so revealingly profiled. This book is must-reading for anyone fascinated by the history of aviation.",

She is two thousand years old, a Child of the Millennia, the first vampire ever made by the great Marius. David persuades her to tell the story of her life.Pandora begins, reluctantly at first and then with increasing passion, to recount her mesmerizing tale, which takes us through the ages, from Imperial Rome to eighteenth-century France to twentieth-century Paris and New Orleans. She carries us back to her mortal girlhood in the world of Caesar Augustus, a world chronicled by Ovid and Petronius. This is where Pandora meets and falls in love with the handsome, charismatic, lighthearted, still-mortal Marius. This is the Rome she is forced to flee in fear of assassination by conspirators plotting to take over the city. And we follow her to the exotic port of Antioch, where she is destined to be reunited with Marius, now immortal and haunted by his vampire nature, who will bestow on her the Dark Gift as they set out on the fraught and fantastic adventure of their two turbulent centuries together.",

The climate has altered irrevocably, the cities have imploded into vicious shards, and the stars haven't been seen for months. The sky is a shimmering arras of reds and greens and golds, the result of global warming, it is thought.Jack Finnegan, publisher of the world's last literary magazine, is dying of AIDS while he watches the floodwaters rise toward his decaying mansion on the Hudson. Trip Marlowe, a rock star addicted to the wild glories of the hallucinogenic drug IZE, is immortalizing himself as a digital VR icon. Marz Candry, the \"Hyacinth Girl\" blooming under the canopy of the Glimmering, is waiting to bear Trip's child, while the fellahin and their underground cults are preparing the frenzies of the Night of the Thousand Years.All these and more are drawn in to the seductive web of Leonard Thrope, the Warhol-like \"sociocultural pathologist\" who arrives from the East with his entourage bearing a gift: an elixir developed by an exiled scientist in a Tibetan lamasery. Jack (who tries everything, on principle) finds he is no longer HIV positive, no longer dying. Thanks to Fusax, something far more terrible, far more wonderful, far more unexpected is about to happen to Jack Finnegan and his world.",

Leonard is a huge fan of the artist and is thrilled when Cambridge hosts an Escher exhibit. While basking in all-things-Escher during his first visit to the gallery, he meets a woman in a green coat - Frieda - who is equally enthralled by Escher's brilliance. Leonard falls instantly in love - but Frieda hurries away without telling him her last name, her address, or her phone number - though she does hint that if he knew more about her, he would not love her.Despite Frieda's warning and their all-too-brief encounter, Leonard is now desperately in love with this elusive woman - and desperate to find her. So Homer and Mary offer to help - but looking for her makes them feel as if they were lost in an Escher labyrinth as they encounter murders of the past, secrets of today, modern fortune-tellers, and the ghosts of Mount Auburn Cemetery.",

Today's women, struggling to succeed in a man's world, must learn a crucial lesson of their own: men and women are not equal--and that is a woman's greatest strength. From the wars of intimacy to battles of public life, whether confronting bosses, competitors, or lovers, the greatest power belongs to the woman who dares to use the subtle weapons that are hers alone.This provocative work urges women to claim what they want and deserve, offering a bold new battle plan that celebrates a woman's unique gifts: passion and intuition, sensitivity and cunning. It draws from history's legendary female divas and poets, saints and sinners, artists and activists--who, armed with a desire for justice and a spirit of outrageousness, achieved their impossible dreams. Their lasting legacy is codified in The Princessa: act like a woman, fight like a woman, and life will be yours to command.",

By 2 a.m. the last lifeboat had rowed frantically away. Minutes later the great ship sank. Fifteen hundred people had lost their lives.Every Man for Himself recaptures those four crucial days at the end of the Belle Epoque. J. Pierpont Morgan's nephew, en route to New York, has booked passage on the world's most luxurious ocean liner. His companions include a host of Guggenheims, Vanderbilts, and upper crust fellow travelers. It is a voyage of black-tie dining and moonlight serenades, of illicit romances and reserved travelers with shadowy pasts. The young Morgan soon finds his destiny linked to those of his shipmates, memorable personalities all, as the great ship sails toward her fate. But the Titanic's destiny may not be unknown to everyone on board: just hours before tragedy strikes, one of the passengers is heard to remark, \"Have you not yet learned that it's every man for himself?\" Bainbridge vividly recreates each scene of the voyage, from the suspicious fire in the Number 10 coal boiler, to the champagne and crystal of the first-class public rooms, to that terrible midnight chaos in the frigid North Atlantic. This remarkable, haunting tale confirms Bainbridge as a consummate observer of human behavior and the human condition.",

        "Title": "Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics",
        "Authors": "By Moynihan, Daniel Patrick",
        "Description": "Ten years before the Soviet Union collapsed, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan stood almost alone in predicting its demise.  As the intelligence community and cold war analysts churned out statistics demonstrating the enduring strength of the Moscow regime, Moynihan, focusing on ethnic conflict, argued that the end was at hand.  Now, with such conflict breaking out across the world, from Central Asia to South Central Los Angeles, he sets forth a general proposition: Far from vanishing, ethnicity has been and will be an elemental force in international politics.      Drawing on a lifetime of scholarship, the Senator provides in Pandaemonium a subtle, richly textured account of the process by which theory has grudgingly begun to adapt to reality.  Moynihan--whose previous studies range over thirty years from Beyond the Melting Pot (with Nathan Glazer) to the much acclaimed On the Law of Nations--provides a deep historical look at ethnic conflict around the globe.  He shows how the struggles that now absorb our attention have been going on for generations and explain much of modern history.  Neither side in the cold war grasped this reality, he writes. Neither the liberal myth of the melting pot nor the Marxist fantasy of proletarian internationalism could account for ethnic conflict, and so the international system stumbled from one set of miscalculations to another.      Toward the close of World War I, Woodrow Wilson declared the \"self-determination of peoples\" to be an Allied goal for the peace.  Toward the end of World War II, Josef Stalin inserted \"self-determination of peoples\" into Article I of the United Nations Charter, defining \"The Purposes\" of the new world organization.  This process has been going on ever since.  The first phase, the breaking up of empire, was relatively peaceful.  The second phase, presaged by the 1947 partition of India, is certain to be far more troubled, as fifty to a hundred new countries emerge.      Moynihan argues, however, that a dark age of \"ethnic cleansing\" is not inevitable; that the dynamics of ethnic conflict can be understood, anticipated, moderated.  Ethnic pride can be a source of dignity and of stability, if only its legitimacy is accepted.  Moynihan writes in a learned, reflective voice: at times theoretical, but always in the end directed to issues of fierce immediacy.  A splendid achievement, Pandaemonium begins the re-education of Western diplomacy.",

He had one other passion: Sarah, a dark-haired sprite of a woman whom he had loved from his childhood days. As a Jew during the Roman occupation of Palestine, Joseph would have to fight for both his loves.Combining impeccable historical research with a story of incredible power, Alexandra Ripley re-creates Joseph of Arimathea's life and times. From the dusty roads of Palestine to the marble palaces of Rome to the fierce barbarian villages of ancient Britain, Joseph journeys toward destiny. He will nearly lose Sarah in a forced marriage to another, play a dangerous game of intrigue with Herod and Salome, and - in a moment that would change his life and that of his crippled daughter, Helena - meet the man called Jesus of Nazareth.",

The recipes will make use of bold seasonings that instantly add flavor without the need for long simmering.  The book is organized around main courses, with chapters broken down into menus with poultry or meat, menus with fish or seafood, vegetarian menus and pasta menus.  In addition, an introductory chapter will offer strategies for quick, low-fat cooking, including tips on picking fresh ingredients, stocking a pantry and cooking techniques.  The menus will follow today's flexible dining habits.  Some menus serve two, and others serve four.  Most menus will include three recipes, but they will not all follow the traditional pattern of appetizer, main course and dessert.  Sometimes, for example, there will be a main course with two accompaniments.  Those menus that do not include desserts will have suggestions for simple desserts (usually seasonal fruit, frozen yogurt or other desserts already in the book) that would complement the menu well.",

        "Description": "For today\u2019s shell-shocked individual investors, financial expert Charles B. Carlson offers hands-on advice on how to survive \u2014 and thrive \u2014 in a wildly fluctuating market.     The economic recession of the past year, followed by the tragedy of September 11, sent a ripple of panic through investors in 2001. The market shed trillions of dollars in wealth, and hundreds of thousands of individual investors suffered substantial financial losses. The volatility we experienced last year was more than a fluke, argues investment expert Charles B. Carlson. With the ongoing changes in the economy, including changes in corporate reporting laws, instant availability of financial information, and the ability to buy and sell stocks with the touch of a keystroke, volatility is here to stay.     But volatility isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, Carlson argues, if you know how to weather today stormy markets, investing in them can be very profitable.     In The Smart Investor\u2019s Survival Guide, Carlson shows investors how to make volatility work to their advantage. First, he argues, it is critical that investors match their investment style \u2014 growth, value, buy and hold \u2014 to the kinds of stocks they pick. For long-term investors, Carlson recommends that a portion of their portfolio be invested in what he calls the calm eye of the storm, \u201ceasy hold\u201d stocks that have consistent, steady growth, and very low volatility. Even in the terrible market downturn of 2000, when the Nasdaq lost 39 percent of its value and stocks like Lucent and Cisco saw their share price drop by 80 percent  or more, a number of investment sectors actually gained in value. The Dow Jones index, minus its technology stocks, broke even. In other words, even in the worst markets, not every stock or sector goes down.     Through what he calls the nine essential laws of successful investing in a volatile market, Carlson reveals:  \u2022 How to diversify the portfolios across stock sectors and investment vehicles  \u2022 The critical importance of matching one\u2019s investment style \u2014 value, growth, buy and hold \u2014 to the kinds of stocks one invests in  \u2022 The importance of \u201ceasy hold\u201d \u2014 no-brainer stocks \u2014 in a portfolio, stocks that will grow 10 to12 percent a year with minimal        volatility.    Written by one of the most trusted names in the financial community, The Smart Investor\u2019s Survival Guide shows investors how to master today\u2019s turbulent markets, and profit from them.",

These people, as gradually becomes clear, are three generations of the same family, none of which has any knowledge of the other two. But there exists down through these far-flung generations a meshwork of cause and effect that reverberates all the way into the present.The interrelatedness of these three pairs of people, the twining of their destinies, is the core of the book.Though the novel takes place in three different centuries, it is rooted in such timeless attributes as social mores, class and money, as well as in historical events such as the battle at Leipzig, where Napoleon was crushed, and the ruins of Berlin in 1945.These events are woven through the private lives of the characters, among whom are a lonely and young officer, a sculptress trying to find truth in the stone she works with, a man terrified of flying who forces himself to fly constantly, a woman who embodies the ineffable bond between an animal and a human being, and others responding to their world, their natures and their needs. It is a novel about the attempt of human beings to know the past, to know one another and to know themselves. It is about love, loss, sexual passion, human perception and the possibility that the search for goodness may be an act of insanity.",
