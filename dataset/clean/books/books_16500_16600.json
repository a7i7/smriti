        "Authors": "By Mukherjee, Bharati",
        "Description": "National Book Critics Circle Award-winner Bharati Mukherjee has long been known not only for her elegant, evocative prose but also for her characters--influenced by ancient customs and traditions but also very much rooted in modern times. In The Tree Bride, the narrator, Tara Chatterjee (whom readers will remember from Desirable Daughters), picks up the story of an East Bengali ancestor. According to legend, at the age of five Tara Lata married a tree and eventually emerged as a nationalist freedom fighter. In piecing together her ancestor's transformation from a docile Bengali Brahmin girl-child into an impassioned organizer of resistance against the British Raj, the contemporary narrator discovers and lays claim to unacknowledged elements in her 'American' identity. Although the story of the Tree Bride is central, the drama surrounding the narrator, a divorced woman trying to get back with her husband, moves the novel back and forth through time and across continents.",

She was lying on the floor just in front of her desk, face-up, dressed in black pants and top, her arms and legs twitching violently as if she had touched a high-voltage wire... New York Times bestselling author and Cosmopolitan editor in chief Kate White knows firsthand that the magazine business is murder. Now she's brought back her smart and gutsy crime writer Bailey Weggins for a case set against the glossy pages of a celebrity rag where somebody is about to give Bailey's new boss a lethal deadline. Talk about rapid turnover-in a matter of days Bailey Weggins gets axed from one New York magazine and hired by another. Her new job at Buzz, a weekly filled with sizzling gossip, has Bailey covering celebrity crime, including the starlet who got caught stuffing Fendi purses down her pants and the aging hunk who shot his lover with a Magnum. And Bailey doesn't have to look far for her next story: she finds her boss, Mona Hodges, gasping her last breath after being bludgeoned with a blunt object. A raging tyrant, Mona made Buzz a top 'zine but racked up an impressive enemies list along the way. Everyone from a chubby singer she dubbed \"Fat Chance\" to a mail guy she once reamed out would be glad to see Mona six feet under. And Bailey Weggins intends to get the scoop on whodunit even though one of her closest friends is at the top of the suspects list. Now, with her strappy sandals in one hand and her cell phone in the other, Bailey's out hunting for clues everywhere from the mean streets of Brooklyn's Little Odessa to a posh company picnic in the Hamptons. In just about a New York minute she's got a crush on a sexy filmmaker-and some scary insight into her boss's murder. The first can give her the hot summer fling she's itching to have. The second can get her killed...",

Allanbrook, living in a house above the gorgeous ruin of Naples, is passionately involved with an Italian woman who is a ringer for Bette Davis. He is in love with Italy, with the scugnizzi (wiseguys) of the back alleys, with the opera at San Carlo, with this most dramatic of cities. Allanbrook had earlier been among the first Americans to land in North Africa, at Christmas in 1943, and had lived for years uncomfortably close to the fighting, in a division that took heavy casualties. Watching as his friends died, he was among those few who won through to watch the tide of war ebb. See Naples has great sweep, rich humor, and broad learning. It is a remarkable creative act, a stunning tri",

        "Description": "Presidential Decision Making describes two organizational challenges the President faces - the interrelatedness of the issues he is expected to address and the fragmented structure of the executive departments and offices he presides over. The dynamics and problems of the Presidency are illuminated in this inside account of decision making in the White House. Newly elected presidents invariably proclaim their commitment to an enlarged role for cabinet, department, and agency heads but often abandon the effort after a few months in office. The Economic Policy Board, a cabinet-level body established shortly after Gerald Ford became President, was one of the most systematic and sustained attempts to organize advice for the President in recent decades. This book examines in detail the Board's deliberations over three controversial policy issues: the 1975 State of the Union tax proposals, the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Grain Agreement, and the 1976 footwear import decision. In evaluating these decisions and assessing the Board, which Gerald Ford called 'the most important institutional innovation of my administration', the author draws on scores of interviews with cabinet officials and career civil servants. The author proposes methods for organizing the decision-making process in the White House and for structuring the cabinet-level committees.",

But it's more than his skill and cunning on the mean streets that makes Joe stand out among the legion of cat detectives on the prowl today -- it's how Joe cracks cases that makes him so unique. Join Joe Grey, his lady friend Dulcie, and their tattercoat friend Kit in the eleventh delightful installment in the series that \"raises the stakes of the feline sleuth genre\" (Booklist) and discover the secret they hide from most people -- and the mystery that makes Joe Grey so exceptional.CAT BREAKING FREEThe fur starts flying -- the fur of Joe Grey, Feline P.I., that is -- when a gang from L.A. comes up to tranquil Molena Point, California, and begins breaking into the village's quaint shops. After all, Molena Point has been his home since he was a kitten eating scraps from the garbage behind the local delicatessen, and he doesn't take well to marauding strangers. Joe even wonders whether the blonde who's moved in next door to his human companion Clyde could be a part of the gang -- she's been acting pretty suspicious lately.But when the strangers start trapping and caging feral cats -- speaking cats, like Joe and his girlfriend Dulcie -- it proves too much for the intrepid four-footed detective. And when one of the gang is murdered, and a second mysterious death comes to light, he has no choice but to try to stop the crimes. Joe, Dulcie, and Kit, who used to be a stray herself, are deep into the investigation when they are able to release the three trapped felines. But as Kit leads them away to freedom, will she herself return to that wild life?In this marvelous book that once again opens the door to the spectacular world of Joe Grey, meet three new cats -- winning cats drawn from among hundreds of their owners' entries and chosen at random to appear in this book -- and join old friends and new in Shirley Rousseau Murphy's most ambitious and enjoyable mystery to date.",

        "Title": "The End of Marketing as We Know It",
        "Authors": "By Zyman, Sergio",
        "Description": "Marketing as we know it today is about image. It's about getting consumers to love your products. It's about producing award-winning commercials and promotions, and creating ads people like. It's about buzzwords like \"events,\" \"relationships,\" and \"intimacy.\" Problem is, it's not working. So says the \"Aya-Cola,\" Sergio Zyman, two-time marketing czar of Coca-Cola and today quite possibly the most famous marketer--and marketing gadfly--in the world. Brilliant and irascible, Zyman is best known for reinventing The Coca-Cola Company's marketing approach by spearheading the launches of such world-class global brands as Diet Coke, New Coke, Classic Coke, Fruitopia, and Sprite. Over a combined thirteen-year period, Zyman directed a zestful multibillion-dollar marketing effort, masterminding such timeless campaigns as \"Coke Is It!\" and \"Always Coca-Cola,\" that resulted in sales of more than 15 billion cases of Coke products per year to over 5 billion consumers in 190 countries. In The End of Marketing As We Know It, Zyman reveals, with characteristic flair, the counterintuitive and often provocative marketing strategies and tactics that earned him the nickname \"Aya-Cola\" on Madison Avenue and helped to increase the market value of The Coca-Cola Company from a mere $56 billion to an astounding $193 billion in just five years. Shattering the mystique surrounding the discipline of marketing and upending the tradition of creating popular, crowd-pleasing ads and promotions, Zyman recounts such illuminating anecdotes as why he decided not to rerun the much-loved \"I'd like to teach the world to sing\" Coke commercial and why \"feel-good\" marketing is pointless unless it results in sales. He also explores: Why marketing isn't an art but a science How a well-honed strategy is more important to your success than what your ads say How everything communicates--and what that means to consumers The rise of consumer democracy--and the threat of consumer communism How marketing locally is necessary to build global equity Why marketing is too important to be left to the marketing department How ad agencies are fixated on the wrong things And why: It's crucial to increase your marketing budget--not to cut it--when sales are down Megabrands are a terrible idea, but huge brands are a great idea It's suicide to base your sales projections on previous performance You must be focused on profit, not volume for volume's sake It's sometimes necessary to enter a category just to kill it All marketers must be accountable to shareholdersVisionary and rogue, The End of Marketing As We Know It captures a seismic shift in marketing, from the master of the trade.",

        "Description": "Combat Golf is certainly great fun to read but it is also a practical guide to improving your game at every level, especially the level that counts the most - winning. \"Make no mistake about it,\" counsels leading golf expert Captain Ollstein, West Point grad and a golfer of formidable reputation, \"golf is war. If you're not looking to win, you probably shouldn't show up.\"Even if your hunger for victory is less than savage, you'll learn inside secrets that will help you in every aspect of your play. Captain Ollstein does it by applying centuries-proven military strategies to all the situations that might arise hole by hole. Whether you're negotiating a handicap, assessing your opponent, preparing yourself mentally, rallying from a triple bogey, fighting as a team, or, most important, applying subtle psychological operations (\"Psyops\" as they're called in the armed forces), the ultimate goal is \"to destroy your opponent's will to win.\"Immortal military quotations down through the ages and amusing illustrations flavor Captain Ollstein's clear-headed packet of for-your-eyes-only instructions. Just don't let this document fall into enemy hands.",

The triumphant collapse of communism has brought neither economic stability nor social democracy to the former Soviet Union. Nor, for that matter, to the rest of the world. We are living in a time of fragmentation: increasing disunity in Europe, dangerous eruptions in the Islamic republics, growing disparity between the world's rich and poor, and the evils of the \"permissive cornucopia\" in America which, through overstimulation of material desires and sensual self-gratification, is leading to the collapse of Western moral and spiritual values. In short, we are living in a philosophical climate that is \"out of control.\" It is Zbigniew Brzezinski's firm belief that we must draw both moral and political lessons from the \"megadeaths\" of the twentieth century, a century in which at least 167 million people were slaughtered in the name of the \"politics of organized insanity,\" or the \"metamyths\" of such dictators as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, among others. Unless we can practice selfrestraint derived from a moral commitment in the quest for global democratic \"interdependence,\" we stand destined to risk again our very own survival.",

What he reveals to us is a true electronic frontier of fiercely independent enthusiasts who have created closely knit communities and a rich culture on-line, exchanging everything from scientific data to sexual fantasies, child-rearing tips, and free-ranging political opinions.As Rheingold makes clear, this one of several possible \"futures\" already exists in very appealing form on-line. The question he poses is: Will these original homesteaders on the electronic frontier now be driven out by the \"railroad and cattle barons\" of the communications industry? Even more important, through censorship and commercialization, will we all lose the greatest resource ever for community-building and the free expression of ideas, even before most of us know of its existence?Howard Rheingold is the ultimate insider on networked communication, a key participant in the Bay Area \"WELL\" on-line community. Venturing out from his own neighborhood on the WELL, he gives us a tour of on-line culture in Japan, England, France, and on small and large bulletin boards and networks throughout the United States. He shows us the depth of human interaction made possible, ironically enough, by this seemingly faceless technology, as well as the power of true electronic democracy, and the positive educational force of this medium with which school children in Wyoming can download the greatest research libraries in the world onto their own desktop computers, or interact directly with the White House through electronic mail.But while The Virtual Community is filled with the promise of the ultimate in human development through the global network, Rheingold tempers his enthusiasm with warnings of darker possibilities. What could be the electronic Athens is in danger of becoming one more massive, worldwide opportunity for \"amusing ourselves to death\" with drivel as Geraldo and The Brady Bunch go interactive. Even more chilling are the Orwellian possibilities once we are all wired into the NET, and all our transactions - commercial, political, personal - are electronically mediated and recorded. \"When Big Brother arrives,\" Rheingold warns us, \"he may come in the form of a grocery clerk.\"Visionary, cautionary, hopeful, exciting - The Virtual Community is a must-read for anyone hoping to understand the next wave of human culture as it moves on-line.",

As he pieces together his scattered memories, we are brought back to a quiet, suburban street where two boys--Keith and his sidekick, Stephen--are engaged in their own version of the war effort: spying on the neighbors, recording their movements, and ferreting out their secrets. But when Keith utters six shocking words, the boy's game of espionage takes a sinister and unintended turn, transforming a wife's simple errands and the ordinary rituals of family life into the elements of adult catastrophe.Childhood and innocence, secrecy, lies and repressed violence are all gently laid bare as once again Michael Frayn powerfully demonstrates that what appears to be happening in front of our eyes often turns out to be something we cannot see at all.",
