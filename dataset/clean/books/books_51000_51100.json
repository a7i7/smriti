Clair and Helen Knightly are a parent and child locked in a relationship so unrelenting that they have become the center of each other's worlds. But as this novel opens, Helen crosses a boundary she never thought she would approach. And while her act is almost unconscious, it somehow seems like the fulfillment of a lifetime's unspoken wishes.Over the next twenty-four hours, Helen's life rushes in at her as she is forced to confront the choices that have brought her to this one riveting crossroad. As a woman who spent years trying to win the love of someone who had none to spare, she now faces an uncertain and dangerous freedom. With her unflinching ability to confront the violence and danger that lurk beneath life's everyday surface, Sebold explores the complex ties within families, the meaning of devotion, and the thin line that separates us from our most haunting impulses. The Almost Moon is a story of passion and redemption written with the strength of voice that only Alice Sebold can bring to the page.",

        "Description": "Dr. Dan Baker, director of the Life Enhancement Program at Canyon Ranch, has devoted his life to teaching people how to be happy. And apparently, most of us could use a little tutoring. Research has shown that the root of unhappiness--fear--lies in the oldest, reptilian part of our brains, and negative reactions are often dictated by primal instincts. We're literally \"hardwired for hard times.\" In What Happy People Know, Dr. Baker uses evidence from the new science of happiness to show us how we can overcome this genetic predisposition toward negative reactions and lead a truly rich, happy, and healthy life.In this book, Dr. Baker shares the program that has revolutionized the lives of countless unhappy people, VIP's and regular Joes and Janes alike. First, you'll learn the only two issues that ever cause unhappiness and devise your plan to overcome both of them. Then, Dr. Baker teaches you how to spot the happiness traps, the five doomed ways we try to make ourselves happy, only to dig ourselves further into misery. Finally, he shares his happiness tools, the six simple skills that, when practiced consistently, will inevitably lead to greater optimism, courage, good humor, and fulfillment--in short, to happiness.",

Summer Reading offers a seductive glimpse into the intersecting lives of three very different women.Summer in the Hamptons means crowded beaches during the day and lavish parties in the evening, but Angela Graves, a retired English professor, prefers the company of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Charlotte Bront\u00eb. Her only steady social contacts are with the women in the reading groups she leads, among them, is wealthy Lissy Snyder, a beautiful newlywed who hosts the twice-monthly meetings of the Page Turners and takes pains to hide a reading disability and her emotional neediness. Hamptons local Michelle Cutty, Lissy\u2019s housecleaner, eavesdrops on the group\u2019s discussions\u2013of books and gossip\u2013when she\u2019s not snooping through Lissy\u2019s closets.

        "Description": "From the epic poems of Homer to the glittering art and architecture of Greece's Golden Age to the influential Roman systems of law and leadership, the classical world has established the foundations of our culture, as well as many of its enduring achievements. Astonishingly in-depth in its coverage of the entire 1000-year history of the classical world and richly illustrated, The Oxford History of the Classical World offers the general reader the definitive companion to the Graeco-Roman world, its history, and its achievements.       The first volume, Classical Greece and the Hellenistic World, covers the period from the eighth to first centuries B.C., a period unparalleled in history for its brilliance in literature, philosophy, and the visual arts. It also treats the Hellenization of the Middle East by the monarchies established in the area conquered by Alexander the Great.       The second volume, Classical Rome, covers early Rome and Italy, the expansion of the Roman republic, the foundation of the Roman Empire by Augustus, its consolidation in the first two centuries A.D., and the later Empire and its influence on Western civilization.       The editors--three eminent classicists, John Boardman, Jasper Griffin, and Oswyn Murray--intersperse chapters on political and social history with chapters on literature, philosophy, and the arts, and reinforce the historical framework with maps and chronological charts.   The two volumes also contain bibliographies and a full index, as well as color plates, black and white illustrations, and maps integrated into the text.       The contributors--thirty of the world's leading scholars--present the latest in modern scholarship through masterpieces of wit, brevity, and style.  While concentrating on the aspects essential to understanding each period, they also focus on those elements of the classical world that remain of lasting importance and interest to readers today.  Together, these volumes provide both a provocative and entertaining window into our past.",

In Crusader's Cross, a deathbed confession from an old schoolmate resurrects a story of injustice, the murder of a young woman, and a time in Robicheaux's life he has tried to forget.Her name may or may not have been Ida Durbin. It was back in the innocent days of the 1950s when Robicheaux and his brother, Jimmie, met her on a Galveston beach. She was pretty and Jimmie fell for her hard -- not knowing she was a prostitute on infamous Post Office Street, with ties to the mob. Then Ida was abducted and never seen again.Now, decades later, Robicheaux is asking questions about Ida Durbin, and a couple of redneck deputy sheriffs make it clear that asking questions is a dangerous game. With a series of horrifying murders and the sudden appearance of Valentine Chalons and his sister, Honoria, a disturbed and deeply alluring woman, Robicheaux is soon involved not only with the Chalons family but with the murderous energies of the New Orleans underworld. Also, he meets and finds himself drawn into a scandalous relationship with a remarkable Catholic nun.Brilliant, brooding, and filled with the author's signature lyricism, Jim Burke's latest novel is a darkly suspenseful work of literature.",

The girls are frightened and traumatized, but they forge a bond with the campers who discovered them - a wheelchair-bound paraplegic and her elderly aunt.With the reappearance of the children comes an odd and unsettling presence in the park, a sense of disembodied evil and unspeakable terrors: small animals are found mercilessly slaughtered, and a sinister force seems to still control the girls. As Anna investigates, she finds herself caught up in the machinations of a paranoid religious sect bent on protecting its secrets and keeping the girls sequestered from law enforcement and psychiatric help.Following the trail of the many suspects, especially that of the cult's intense youth-group leader, Anna comes to find the force against which the children's minds have been broken. This evil has the eyes of a visionary and the soul of the devil. Anna will discover the truth - even if it kills her.",

        "Title": "Golf and the Spirit: Lessons for the Journey",

        "Description": "Golf. It's the ultimate head game. And when nothing but the best advice will do, along comes M. Scott Peck, M.D., the celebrated psychiatrist and author of the best-selling self-help book of all time, The Road Less Traveled.In Golf and the Spirit, M. Scott Peck writes a book for beginners and masters alike--and even for nongolfers. It goes beyond mechanics to explore the deeper issues, ways of successfully managing the emotional, psychological, and spiritual aspects of this most wonderful, maddening, deflating, and inspiring game.Playing side by side with M. Scott Peck on an imaginary course of his own design--complete with illustrations of each hole--you will come to see the profound truths in this seemingly simple game. Appreciate that life is not linear. Come to understand your own anger and how to heal that which gets in your way. Accept the gifts of humility. Appreciate kenosis, the process by which the self empties itself of self. Benefit from teachers. Know that in weakness often there is strength. Realize that to experience the blessings of golf and life fully, you must accept the divinity that underlies all things.Like the best-selling volumes of Harvey Penick and Michael Murphy, Golf and the Spirit makes a unique contribution to the literature of golf and life. It goes beyond the body to address the heart and soul of the game, creating a rare opportunity for transformation in the lives of its readers, both on and off the fairway.It seems to me the human condition is most basically that we are willful creatures living in a world that, much of the time, doesn't behave the way we want it to. We live in the tension between our will and reality. Sometimes with great effort and expertise, we can change reality or bend it to our will. At other times--also with great effort and expertise--it is we who must change by coming to accept the limitations of the world and of ourselves. How we do this--how we deal with the hazards of life--is quite akin to how we deal with the hazards of a golf course.Sooner or later golfers who stick with the game long enough will almost always come to see it as a metaphor for life. But the word metaphor fails to do justice to all that golf has to teach us. I would go even further and say that, in its own way, golf is life and, not only that, life condensed. If we choose to use it as such, I believe that golf, next to marriage and parenthood, can routinely be the greatest of life's learning opportunities.",

Instead, he returns to what he refers to as \"violence for money.\" When Gem, the professional border-crosser who calls herself his wife, brings him a job tracking down a runaway teenager, Burke finds himself in a long, dark tunnel of lies - lined with more games than players.Burke takes to the unfamiliar streets, quickly and brutally establishing a presence. The whisper-stream carries him to a fanatical group of criminal Samaritans dedicated to supplying adequate drugs for those suffering from chronic pain. Forced into a potentially deadly alliance, Burke walks the wire between betrayals, risking it all for a girl he has never met.

Tandy Willowby, one of the moms-to-be in her birthing class, has gone missing, just days before her due date - not even showing up at the shower at Eve and Roarke's place that she'd been looking forward to so much. A recent emigrant from London, Tandy has few friends in New York, and no family. When Eve enters Tandy's apartment and finds Mavis's shower gift wrapped and ready on the table - and Tandy's packed hospital bag still on the floor - her spine starts tingling.Normally, this would be turned over to Missing Persons. Eve has more than enough on her plate trying to find out who murdered Natalie Copperfield and her fiance, both employed at a highly prestigious accounting firm.

She'll have to track Tandy down while tracing the deals and double-crosses hidden in the files of some of the city's richest and most secretive citizens, in a race against a particularly vicious killer.

        "Description": "During their eight years in the White House, Bill and Hillary Clinton worked together more closely than the public ever knew. Their intertwined personal and professional lives had far-reaching consequences\u2013for politics, domestic policy, and international affairs\u2013and their marital troubles became a national soap opera. Based on unparalleled access to scores of Clinton insiders\u2013cabinet officers, top administration officials, close personal friends\u2013and skilled analysis of a vast written record, including previously unavailable private papers, For Love of Politics is the first book to explain the dynamics of Bill and Hillary\u2019s relationship, showing that they are two halves of a unique whole and that it is impossible to understand one Clinton without factoring in the other. Sally Bedell Smith, acclaimed author of Grace and Power: The Private World of the Kennedy White House, offers intimate scenes from the Clinton marriage, with new details and insights into how a passion for politics sustained Bill and Hillary through one crisis after another. With clarity and depth, Smith examines the origins of an unconventional copresidency, explains the impact of the Clintons\u2019 tensions as well as their talents, and reveals how Hillary shifted from openly exercising power in the first two years to acting as a \u201chidden hand,\u201d advising her husband on a range of foreign and domestic issues as well as decisions on hiring and firing. Smith describes for the first time the inner workings of a White House with an unprecedented \u201cthree forces to be reckoned with\u201d\u2013Bill, Hillary, and Al Gore\u2013and shows how the First Lady\u2019s rivalry with the Vice President played out in the West Wing and even more profoundly during the 2000 campaign. As Hillary seeks to follow in her husband\u2019s footsteps, this riveting book will leave readers marveling at what they never knew about Bill\u2019s intensely covered presidency\u2013and wondering what it would be like to have two presidents, both named Clinton, living in the White House.",

The fragile peace in Asia is shattered when what was supposed to be a joint U.S.-Japan-South Korea mock bombing raid turns lethal. Instead of hewing to the script, South Korean fighter-bombers streak north to destroy several North Korean command-and-control, special forces, and secret police centers in support of a massive people's revolt against the Communist regime. To the world's surprise, the raids are a complete success. The North Korean military surrenders. The borders are thrown wide open and the United Republic of Korea is born.But this United Korea is also the world's newest nuclear power.

Within thirty minutes, Savich and Sherlock are aboard an FBI helicopter, headed for Parlow.Agent Crowne barely manages to bring his Cessna down in the narrow Cudlow Valley and haul the unconscious Dr. MacLean from the burning wreckage before it explodes. Their crash is witnessed by Rachael Abbott, a young woman who has just narrowly escaped drowning by assailants who drugged her, tied her to a cement block, and threw her into Black Rock Lake.When Savich and Sherlock arrive in Parlow, they discover Jack is down but not out, that Rachael saved his and Dr. MacLean's lives, and that she's hiding something big.To add to the complexity of the situation, Dr. MacLean has been diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a pernicious disease that makes the victim say whatever comes to mind with no regard to consequences. With a patient list of Washington's elite movers and shakers, MacLean has almost certainly compromised doctor-patient confidentiality, and one of his patients, they presume, is out to shut him up. But which one, and why?As for Rachael, they soon discover that she's the bastard daughter of Senator John James Abbott, scion of a powerful family, who was killed in an auto accident three weeks before. Who tried to drown her, and why? Was her father's death really an accident?Suspects are thick on the ground, murder attempts are vicious and immediate, and the terror escalates. In addition to all this, there's no cell phone reception in Parlow, Kentucky. Go figure. What are the poor feds to do?",

        "Description": "An American general is captured in the Middle East by terrorists who threaten to behead him within days. One strange fact: moments before he is rendered unconscious during the attack, the general notices that his captors speak American English. What\u2019s going on?     Gunnery Sgt. Kyle Swanson, a top Marine sniper, is vacationing on a yacht in the Mediterranean when he receives orders to mount a top secret mission to rescue the general. But as the Marines prepare to land in the Syrian desert, they fall victim to a terrible accident. Swanson, the only survivor, then discovers they were also flying into an ambush. How did the enemy have details of a mission known only to a few top American government officials?     Swanson takes off across the desert alone to find the captured general and realizes he is fighting a particularly ruthless and dangerous enemy: American mercenaries working for a very-high-level group of U.S. officials with ties to the White House itself, part of a clandestine conspiracy whose hidden goal is nothing less than total control of the American military. Their sworn enemy is the captured general whose fate now rests in Swanson\u2019s hands.     Filled with the kind of action that author Jack Coughlin lived during his career as a Marine sniper, Kill Zone marks the debut of an extraordinary new series.",

A DEA agent has disappeared while trying to interdict drugs, and very little is being done about it, for diplomatic reasons. The lieutenant has heard of Castillo, knows what he's done, and wants his help in getting the agent back.Castillo reluctantly agrees with the director of National Intelligence and the secretary of state that he is not qualified to try to free the DEA agent, but this decision is overridden by the president, who thinks Castillo can do just about anything, and who has assured the mayor of Chicago - who bounced the missing DEA agent on his knee as a child - that Castillo will get him back.Fully aware that he's over his head dealing with the international drug trade, Castillo nevertheless starts to comply with the president's order, and quickly finds out that certain elements of the intelligence and military communities who have been ordered to give him whatever support he thinks he needs not only are not ready to help - but seem to be willing to kill him and his men if that's what's necessary to keep him from exposing what they have been up to. And what have they been up to? He doesn't even want to think about it.",

At the very least, it disorients birds and animals and damages electrical equipment. At its worst, it causes massive eruptions, earthquakes, and climatic changes. At its very worst, it would mean the obliteration of all living matter, and if that happens-exit Earth.  Sixty years ago, an eccentric Hungarian genius discovered how to artificially trigger such a shift, but then his work was lost, or so it was thought. Now, the charismatic leader of an anti-globalization group plans to use the work to give the world's industrialized nations a small jolt, then reverse the shift back again. The only problem is, it cannot be reversed. Once the shift starts, there is nothing anyone can do about it.  Austin, Zavala, and the rest of the NUMA Special Assignments Team certainly have faced dire situations before, but never have they encountered anything like this. This time . . . even they may be too late.",

Pierre Cottin's vivid photography captures the energy of the harvest, the exuberance of the harvest festivals, and the \"pride of place\" that is as much a part of the Beaujolais region as the wine itself. We meet the people of Beaujolais, too, who are as vigorous and expressive as the wine they produce: Papa Louis Brechard, age 86, who organized the first winegrowers' cooperative; Comte Henri de Rambuteau, owner of Chateau Des Granges; Georges Duboeuf, famous negotiant; and the celebrated chefs of Lyon, including Paul Bocuse and La Mere Brazier.Complete with recipes for regional culinary specialties, a list of wine cellars open to the public for tasting, Beaujolais vocabulary and more, In Beaujolais is a testimonial to a way of life that is steeped in its own traditions of winemaking and the wine trade yet continues to give thanks and respect to the bounty that nature has so generously provided.",
