A Malaysian species can grow to weigh half a ton while a South American species fires miniature pollen darts at nectar-sucking bees.  But the orchid is also the center of an illicit international business: one grower in Santa Barbara tends his plants while toting an Uzi, and a former collector has been in hiding for seven years after serving a jail sentence for smuggling thirty dollars worth of orchids into Britain.  Deftly written and captivatingly researched, Orchid Fever is an endlessly enchanting and entertaining tour of an exotic world.\"A wonderful book, I've been up all night reading it, laughing and crying out in horror and clucking at the vivid images of bureaucracy with the bit in its teeth.\" \u2014Annie Proulx\"An extraordinary, well-told tale of botany, obsession and plant politics.

        "Title": "Tested: One American School Struggles to Make the Grade",
        "Authors": "By Perlstein, Linda",
        "Description": "The pressure is on at schools across America. In recent years, reforms such as No Child Left Behind have created a new vision of education that emphasizes provable results, uniformity, and greater attention for floundering students. Schools are expected to behave more like businesses and judged almost solely on the bottom line: test scores.To see if this world is producing better students, Linda Perlstein immersed herself in a suburban Maryland elementary school. The resulting portrait -- detailed, human, and truly thought-provoking -- is marked by the same narrative gifts and expertise that made Not Much Just Chillin' so illuminating.The school, once deemed a failure, is now held up as an example of reform done right. Perlstein explores the rewards and costs of that transformation, through the experiences of the people who lived it. Nine-year-olds meditate to activate their brains before exams and kindergartners write paragraphs. Teachers attempt to address diverse needs at the same time they are expected to follow daily scripts, and feel compelled to focus on topics that will be tested at the expense of those that won't. The principal attempts to keep it all together, in the face of immense challenges.Perlstein provides the first detailed view of how new education policies are modified by human realities. Tested will be talked about, thought about, written about -- and will almost certainly play an important role in the national debate as the federal education law come up for renewal.",

        "Title": "Common Ground: How to Stop the Partisan War That Is Destroying America",
        "Authors": "By Thomas, Cal and Beckel, Bob",
        "Description": "Inspired by their popular USA Today column, conservative Cal Thomas and liberal Bob Beckel show politicians of both stripes how to get beyond partisanship, restore civility, and move our country forward. Thomas and Beckel are a unique pair in today's political climate\u2014pundits from opposite sides who not only talk to each other but work together to find common ground on some of the most divisive issues facing us, from the war in Iraq to gay marriage to the Patriot Act. Common Ground unmasks the hypocrisy of many of the issues, organizations, and individuals who created and deepened the partisan divide at the center of American politics, and makes a strategic case for why this bickering must stop.Throughout, Thomas and Beckel explode conventional wisdom and offer surprising new conclusions:The Red State/Blue State divide: Myth!A \"common ground\" presidential candidate can win in 2008: Reality!\"Polarizers\" like Ann Coulter and Michael Moore are the future of political debate: Myth!Major-party politics faces extinction: Reality! These guys should know. For years Beckel and Thomas contributed to the climate of polarization in Washington . . . and they admit it. \"We're two guys who spent a lot of years in the polarizing business, but on opposing sides,\" they write. \"We helped write the game plan, and we have participated in everything from getting money out of true believers to appearing on television to help spread the contentious message. In many cases, we wrote the message. We know the gig, and it's just about up.\"In this much-needed book, Thomas and Beckel go beyond their column to offer a sobering overview of the current political divide and its corrosive effect on us all.They also explain how bipartisanship and consensus politics are not only good for the day-to-day democratic process but essential for our nation's future well-being.Entertaining and informative, funny and healing, Common Ground is must reading for all concerned citizens.",

        "Title": "It's My Party, Too: The Battle for the Heart of the GOP and the Future of America",
        "Authors": "By Whitman, Christine Todd",
        "Description": "The Republican party is embroiled in a heated and high-stakes battle between its far-right and moderate wings-with conservatives declaring open warfare on the moderates who ask themselves \"Whatever happened to the party of Lincoln?\" Bearing profound implications not only for the future of the party but also for the future of American politics, this momentous battle will rage on no matter what the outcome of the presidential election.  Christine Todd Whitman retired as a member of the Bush administration in June 2003, tired of the ideological battles in Washington and eager to return home to New Jersey. A lifelong and loyal Republican and a leader of the party's moderate wing, she is a passionate believer in the power of the \"productive middle\" in politics. In the tradition of Democratic Senator Zell Miller's national bestseller A National Party No More, which critiqued the Democratic party's move to the far left, in It's My Party Too she offers a passionate and revealing insider's argument against the hijacking of her party by zealous \"social fundamentalists.\" Recounting many stories from the front lines of her own battles, both as a two-term New Jersey governor and on the hot seat as EPA administrator, she takes readers inside the tumultuous world of our politics today to reveal how a moderate approach can work wonders while that of extremists only leads to more division and fewer solutions.  Relentlessly pushing their ideological stances on abortion rights, race relations, the environment, tax policy, and go-it-alone foreign policy, the conservative extremists are not only violating traditional Republican principles, she argues, but are also holding the party back from achieving a true majority. By playing so slavishly to the far-right base, running negative campaigns and marginalizing women, the party has forsaken the much broader base that propelled the \"Reagan revolution\" and has fueled the country's overheated polarization.  Writing with the straight-talking and keenly intelligent candor that launched her onto the national stage-and made her such an inspiration to women all around the country-Christie Whitman sounds a rallying cry that will be vital reading for the millions of moderate voters who are fed up with the extremism of both parties. From one of the leading moderates in the Republican party-and one of its most powerful women-a thoughtful and provocative critique of the party's hard turn to the right and a call to arms for a return to its moderate roots.",

When Cecily Deravenel tells her eighteen-year-old son Edward of the death of his father, brother, uncle, and cousin in a fire, a part of him dies as well. Edward and his cousin Neville Watkins are suspicious of the deaths. They vow to seek the truth, avenge the deaths, and retake control of their family's business empire.As he grows into a handsome, charismatic man, Edward is torn between duty and desire. There are women in his life for whom he'll risk everything--and one woman who might destroy him. But madness and secrecy lie at the heart of the family, and Edward's enemies are far more ruthless than he knows. He will need his strength more than ever when the house of Deravenel is fatally rocked by betrayal from within. Who will become the ultimate ruler of the Deravenels? Power and money, passion and adultery, ambition and treachery all illuminate a dramatic epic saga that brings to life the glittering Edwardian Era. The Ravenscar Dynasty is based on the familial factions of England's Wars of the Roses, brought to life by the magical, memorable storytelling power that is Barbara Taylor Bradford.",

        "Description": "Published in 1966, The Stuart Constitution at once established itself as the standard documentary textbook for courses in English seventeenth-century history in schools (A-level), polytechnics, and universities, and one which at the same time offered an individual revisionist outlook on many of the problems involved. For the second edition Professor Kenyon has entirely rewritten his commentary to take account of the latest research in this field; he has thoroughly revised the structure of the book, and he has also strengthened the documentation in several important areas, notably the Interregnum, 1649-1660. The book is divided into four parts, the first three of which are devoted to the periods 1603-1640, 1640-1660 and 1660-1688 respectively. The fourth part deals with some of the general issues of government, at both central and local level, throughout the seventeenth century. One hundred and forty-six documents are included in all, and to aid the student reader speling and punctuation have been modernised. This volume forms a companion to the second edition of Professor Elton's The Tudor Constitution, and is likewise available in both hard and paper covers.",

        "Description": "Kenneth O'Donnell was JFK's chief-of-staff and the co-author of  Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye. In this intimate, revealing memoir of his long friendship with Bobby Kennedy, his daughter, Helen, honors his wish that RFK be remembered as the man Ken O'Donnell knew him to be.Kenny and Bobby met at Harvard in 1947, where they were both members of the football and debate teams. It was the beginning of a relationship that would end only with Bobby's death. The two friends spent years at the epicenter of American politics, sharing highs and lows: JFK's ascent to the presidency; Bobby's stormy tenure as chairman of several congressional committees exploring controversial issues and later as Attorney General, locking horns with J. Edgar Hoover and Jimmy Hoffa; and JFK's assassination.Much of the material in this poignant, illuminating memoir has never before been told. The Kennedys granted Helen O'Donnell complete access to the family archives, and encouraged many people who have never before spoken out to cooperate with her.The result is A Common Good, an intimate look at a unique relationship. Ken O'Donnell was there when Camelot began -- and when it ended in violence. In honoring her father's request, Helen O'Donnell has shared with us her profound insights into the emotional relationship of two men at the center of American history in the twentieth century.",

And no one is better equipped to lead a suspenseful tour into the treacherous territory of big-time political lobbying, where the right information and enough influence can buy power\u2013the kind that corrupts . . . and sometimes kills.Arriving home from a fund-raising dinner, senior Illinois senator Lyle Simmons discovers his wife\u2019s brutally bludgeoned body. And like any savvy politician with presidential aspirations, his first move is to phone his attorney. In this case, it\u2019s his old friend and college roommate, former DA Philip Rotondi, who gamely agrees to step out of quiet retirement and into the thick of a D.C.-style political, criminal, and public relations maelstrom from which no one will escape unscathed.

Aided by sleuthing ex-attorneys Mac and Annabel Smith, Rotondi reawakens the prosecutorial skills that served him so well in his gang-busting days, following the stench of dirty money and dirtier tricks across the country and across the thresholds of back rooms and front offices alike\u2013where doing the right thing is for fools and taking on the system is a dead man\u2019s gambit.",

        "Title": "Patriarch: George Washington and the New American Nation",
        "Authors": "By Smith, Richard Norton",
        "Description": "When George Washington agreed to take on the presidency of his new nation, he inspired gratitude and adulation on a scale almost impossible to imagine today. In the years that followed, he would need every ounce of his countrymen's affection as he presided over a government threatened by internal dissension and foreign war. This is the story of Washington under political siege, a trial no less demanding than the Revolutionary War.George Washington emerges in these pages as a necessary hero. Indeed, it is hard to imagine the survival of the young republic without him. We watch him preside over the bitter quarrels within his brilliant Cabinet - enduring the historic feud between Jefferson and Hamilton while struggling successfully to keep the nation out of European conflict. On the personal level, this moving biography confirms Henry Knox's judgment that it was Washington's character, and not the recently signed Constitution, that held the infant Union together.In a supremely readable history, Richard Norton Smith gives us vivid descriptions of stagecoach travel, the capital's yellow fever epidemic of 1793, and life at Washington's beloved Mount Vernon. This George Washington, vastly more human than our inherited image, is a fallible man subject to vanity and disappointment, yet all the greater for his vulnerability. Patriarch tells not only what Washington did but, memorably, what he was like, and how both were essential to the birth of the American Republic.",

For seven years, she endures the treachery of spies, the humiliation of poverty, and intense loneliness and despair while she waits for the inevitable moment when she will step into the role she has prepared for all her life.

It is a compelling chronicle of contemporary British politics and the rise of New Labour, providing the first important record of a remarkable decade in Britain\u2019s history.Here are the defining events of the time, from the Labour Party\u2019s new dawn to the war on terror; from the death of Princess Diana to negotiations for peace in Northern Ireland; from Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq to the Hutton Inquiry of 2003, the year Campbell resigned his position. Here also are Blair\u2019s relationships with world leaders and heads of state, including presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. But above all, here is Tony Blair up close and personal, making the decisions that affected the lives of millions, under relentless and frequently hostile pressure. Often described as the second most powerful figure in Britain, Alastair Campbell is no stranger to controversy. Feared and admired in equal measure, hated by some, he was pivotal to the founding of New Labour and the sensational election victory of 1997. Campbell spent more waking hours alongside the prime minister than anyone, and his diaries\u2014at times brutally frank, often funny, always engrossing\u2014take the reader right to the heart of government.The Blair Years is a story of politics in the raw, of progress and setback, of reputations made and destroyed, under the relentless scrutiny of a 24-hour media. Unflinchingly told, it covers the crises and scandals, the rows and resignations, the ups and downs at No. 10 Downing Street. But amid the landmark events are insights and observations that make this a remarkably human portrayal of some of the most influential people in the world.A completely riveting book about life at the very top, told by a man who saw it all.",

And  most of all, it is about daring to believe in...Answered Prayers. On the outside,  Faith Madison is the very picture of a sophisticated New Yorker. Slim, blond, stylish,  Faith has a life many would envy. Overcoming a childhood marked by tragedy, married  to a successful investment banker and having raised two grown daughters, Faith has  enjoyed her role as mother and wife, and the good life that emanates from their bustling  Manhattan town house. But every step of the way, Faith has carried within her a secret  she could divulge to no one. And with it, she has kept an even more painful secret  from herself. For Faith, it is the sudden death of her stepfather\u2014a man who, like  her husband, Alex, always remained just beyond her reach\u2014that will touch off a journey  of change and revelation. At the funeral, painful memories flood back\u2014and an old  friend reenters Faith\u2019s life. Faith is greeting mourners, when she hears a voice  behind her and a single word that brings a quick smile to her face: \u201cFred.\u201d Only  one person aside from her older brother, Jack, called her that. Brad Patterson was  Jack\u2019s best friend, a long, lanky boy who teased, tormented, and protected Faith  when they fancied themselves \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d as kids. When Jack died years  later, Faith and Brad came together again in their common, inconsolable grief, then  lost touch once more amid the demands of families and busy lives a continent apart.   Now a lawyer in California, Brad has reentered Faith\u2019s life just as she is making  a decision that plunges her marriage into crisis. Determined to fulfill a long-held  desire for a career of her own, Faith applies to law school against her husband\u2019s  wishes, igniting a barrage of anger and recrimination. Faith\u2019s only solace is the  correspondence she has begun with Brad, a man trapped in an empty marriage of his  own, a friend she once lost and has found again. Soon e-mails are flying between  them, bridging three thousand miles, sharing much-needed friendship, support, laughter.  And as these two childhood friends rediscover each other, something extraordinary  is beginning to happen. In the safety of their friendship, Brad will find the courage  to make a decision he should have made years before. And Faith, too, is changing,  beginning to believe in herself\u2014and in her right to grab hold of her dreams. Gathering  a strength she never knew she had, Faith is finally ready to face the most painful  step of all: of sharing the secret that has long been haunting her, and truly opening  up her heart for the first time in her life.  With unerring insight into the hearts  of husbands and wives, lovers and families, Danielle Steel tells a wise and moving  story of the secrets that wound and the choices that heal\u2014and of the second chances  that come only once in a lifetime.",

And for the twins Olivia and Victoria Henderson, two remarkable young women coming of age at the turn of the century, their bond was mysterious, marvelous, and often playful--a secret realm only they inhabited.Olivia and Victoria were the beloved daughters of a man who never fully recovered from his wife's death bearing them in 1893. Shy, serious Olivia, born eleven minutes before her sister, had taken over the role of mother in their lush New York estate, managing not only a household but her rebellious twin's flights of fancy. Free-spirited Victoria wanted to change the world. She embraced the women's suffrage movement and dreamed of sailing to war-torn Europe. Then, in the girls' twenty-first year, as the first world war escalated overseas, a fateful choice changed their lives forever.It began when Victoria's life was about to become a public scandal. It led to a painful decision, and brought handsome lawyer Charles Dawson into the Henderson's life and family. Hand-picked by the twins' father to save his daughter's reputation, Charles was still mourning his wife's death aboard the Titanic, struggling to raise his nine year-old son alone, determined never to lose his heart again. Charles wanted to believe that, for the sake of his son, he could make an unwanted marriage work. But in an act of deception that only Olivia and Victoria could manage, the twins took an irrevocable step, which changed both their lives forever; and took one of the twins to the battlefields of France, the other into a marriage she longed for but could not have.From Manhattan society to the trenches of war-ravaged France, Mirror Image moves elegantly and dramatically through a rich and troubled era. With startling insight, Danielle Steel explores women's choices: between home and adventure, between the love for family and the passion for a cause, between sacrifice and desire. But at the heart of Mirror Image is a fascinating, realistic portrait of identical twins, two vastly different sisters who lead their lives and follow their destinies against a vivid backdrop of a world at war.",

With four wonderful children, India believed in commitment and sacrifice, just as she believed in Doug, the man she married 17 years before. For India, this was the promise she made, the life she had chosen--not the award-winning career as a photojournalist she once had. It was a choice she had never truly regretted. Until she begins to regret it with all her heart.India couldn't pinpoint the exact moment. Perhaps it was the last time her agent called, begging her to take an assignment Doug insisted she turn down. Or perhaps it was when Doug told her he thought of her as a companion and someone to take care of their kids, and not much more. At that moment, the price of the sacrifices she'd made began to seem high.And then, she met Paul Ward. A Wall Street tycoon married to a bestselling author, Paul lived life on his own terms, traveling the world on his own yacht. India hadn't planned to become Paul's friend. Anything more was unthinkable. Yet talking to Paul was so easy. India could share her dreams with him, and offer comfort when Paul suffers a heartbreak of his own. And while Paul urges India to reclaim her career, Doug is adamantly against it, determined to keep her tied to the home. But with Paul's encouragement, India slowly, painfully, begins to break free, and find herself again.Rediscovering her creativity and her courage, India uses Paul like a beacon on the horizon, sharing intimate phone conversations with a man half a world away, a man who never stops reminding her of all that is possible for her. India is changing, and nothing in her life will ever be the same again. Not her marriage. Not her friendship with Paul. And when India is presented with an irresistible opportunity, she makes a heart-wrenching decision, leaving a safe, familiar place-and the people she loves there-to move into the terror of the unknown.Bittersweet is her story, a story of freedom, of having dreams and making choices to find them. With unerring insight, Danielle Steel has created a moving portrait of a woman who dares to embark on a new adventure and the man who helps her get there. Her painful, exhilarating journey inspires us all.",

The Kiss is at once a moving testament to the fragility of life and a breathtaking story about the power of love to heal, to free, to transform, and to make broken spirits whole.On a warm June evening, a red double-decker bus, full of pasengers, speeds down a London street. A few blocks away, a man and a woman climb into a limousine, reveling in a magical evening of dancing and champagne. As their driver pulls into an intersection, the couple shares their first, searching kiss. For a moment, etched in time, all stands still\u2014until, in a flash of metal and glass, their limousine is struck at full speed, crushed under the bus's tremendous weight. And a long journey begins\u2014toward healing, toward hope, toward dreams of an infinite future...Isabelle Forrester is the exquisite wife of a prominent Parisian banker who has long since shut her out of his heart. For lonely years, Isabelle has lived a life of isolation, pouring her passions into caring for her desperately ill son, Teddy, and into making their Paris home as happy as possible for her teenage daughter, Sophie. Isabelle allows herself one secret pleasure: a long-distance friendship by telephone with an American man, a Washington power broker who travels in the highest circles of politics and who, like Isabelle, is trapped in an empty marriage. To Bill Robinson, Isabelle is a godsend, a woman of extraordinary beauty and intellectual curiosity\u2014a kindred spirit who touches him across the miles with her warmth and gentle empathy. Their relationship is a gift, a lifeline that sustains them both through the heartache of marriages they cannot leave and will not betray. Agreeing to meet for a few precious, innocent days in London, Isabelle and Bill find their friendship changing. Then, amidst the sudden crash of steel against steel, they are thrust onto a new path, a path fraught with pain but also with possibility.Now, inside the cool, sterile wards of a London hospital, Isabelle and Bill cling to life, their bodies shattered almost beyond repair. In the days and weeks that follow, they slowly, painfully traverse a road to recovery littered with challenges of the body, spirit, and heart. Together, they must find the strength not only to embrace life again but to face what they have left behind. For Isabell, a loveless marriage turns into a brutal power struggle. For Bill, a time of healing exposes wounds that cut deeper than steel and realities that will test him to his core. For both, a tangle of changing relationships and the tragedy of another loss conspire to separate them once again. And this time they could lose each other forever.In a novel that is as compelling as it is compassionate, Danielle Steel weaves a story of courage in the face of unimaginable loss. With the grace of a master storyteller, she explores the strength it takes to conquer our greatest fears, showing us how the toughest choices can yield the most unexpected rewards...and how the longest, most winding journeys can begin with a single kiss.",

Eventually, he learned that the \u00bfmeteor\u00bf onslaught that had orphaned him had actually been a brief and still secret war between the U.S and its enemies (as told in Warp Speed) using a new warp drive technology that was more secret than top secret. Another secret was that U.S. had been sending faster-than-light ships to other star systems. Most secret of all was that unfriendly aliens were observing the Earth, and while U.S. spaceships were not quite in a war with the unknown aliens, they were shooting at the intruders. Whether any of these answers would do Steven any good was an open question because he learned them only after his was abducted by those very same aliens and was held prisoner on one of their ships orbiting Saturn. At first, he was one of three human prisoners, but he had just seen the aliens completely dissect one of the three, and it looked like either Steven, or the Russian girl who was his fellow prisoner, were scheduled to be the next alien lab experiment. . . .",
