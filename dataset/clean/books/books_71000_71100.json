        "Description": "Here's an etiquette book that teens will want to read\u2014because it keeps them laughing, doesn't preach, and deals with issues that matter to them, as teens themselves reported in a nationwide survey. In How Rude!, author Alex J. Packer blends outrageous humor with sound advice as he guides readers through the mysterious world of manners from A (\"Applause\") to Z (\"Zits\"). He starts by explaining why etiquette is important\u2014because people who know how to handle themselves in social situations come out on top, get what they want, feel good about themselves, and enjoy life to the fullest. Fourteen chapters describe the basics of polite behavior in all kinds of situations at home, in school, and in the world. Teens learn how to be a host with the most (and a guest with the best), what to do (and not do) when going online or waiting in line, how to deal with rude relatives, how to act at the mall and the concert hall, how to make introductions, who invented manners, and much more. Hundreds of \"Dear Alex\" questions and answers cover everything from dating to breaking up, thank-you notes to table manners, ethnic jokes to social cliques, skateboarding to celebrating. Survey results reveal what teens, parents, and teachers think about manners and why they're important. Full of practical tips for every occasion, How Rude! is a serious etiquette encyclopedia\u2014and a hilarious read.",

        "Description": "Fresh from the triumph of We Were the Mulvaneys, Joyce Carol Oates continues her exploration of family love and possibilities of human redemption with this compelling story of how one young woman suffers profoundly in the pursuit of love, but manages to emerge safe and whole.Set in several towns on the Chatauqua River in upstate New York,Man Crazy tells the story of Ingrid Boone, who at age eight is taken into hiding by her beautiful young mother, Chloe. Sought by the men who have taunted Chloe, the authorities, and Ingrid's loving but volatile father still haunted by memories of Vietnam, Ingrid and her mother fight to survive both together and apart. \"Man crazy\" is the label assigned to teenage Ingrid, whose desperate need to find a substitute for her father's affection makes her easy prey for the charismatic leader of a violent cult. Eventually, the police surround the cult compound and a tense standoff erupts in bullets and flames. Ingrid escapes to rebuild her life, and Oates' depiction of this severely damaged young woman's slow but miraculous process of healing stands as one of the most brilliant portraits she has ever created. Oates' gift for haunting imagery reaches new heights in this emotionally resonant work.This will be published simultaneously with the Dutton release of a major new novel from Oates,My Heart Laid Bare.We Were the Mulvaneys was a national bestseller.",

Dyer shows you how to restore balance in your life by offering nine principles for realigning your thoughts so that they correspond to your highest desires.Imagine a balance scale with one end weighted down to the ground, and the other end\u2014featuring the objects of your desires\u2014sticking up precariously in the air. This scale is a measurement of your thoughts. To restore the same balance that characterizes everything in our universe, you have to take up the weighty thoughts so that they match up to your desires.The seasons reflect the overall harmony of life. For example, winter passes and the blossoms emerge. This is balanced by a need to have the trees rest, so autumn arrives on time and helps the trees ready themselves for another period of repose. This book is dedicated to the idea that we\u2019re a vital component of this creative process and have within ourselves the wherewithal to create all that we want if we recognize and revise out-of-balance thoughts.",

It seems relatively simple: kidnap Lena , the Cheo's daughter, demand a vast ransom for her safe return, sit back and wait. Only the Cheo, despotic ruler of the known universe, isn't playing ball. Flanagan and his crew have seen this before, of course, but since they've learned a few tricks from the bad old days and since they know something about Lena that should make the plan foolproof, the Cheo's defiance is a major setback. It is a situation that calls for extreme measures. Luckily, Flanagan has considerable experience in this area. Fortunately, he has had a lifetime to work it out. Unfortunately, he has far less time to execute it. Debatable Space is a space opera of extraordinary imagination, and a brilliantly plotted novel of revenge.",

Dyer reveals how to change the self-defeating thinking patterns that have prevented you from living at the highest levels of success, happiness, and health. Even though you may know what to think, actually changing those thinking habits that have been with you since childhood might be somewhat challenging.If I changed, it would create family dramas . . . I\u2019m too old or too young . . . I\u2019m far too busy and tired . . . I can\u2019t afford the things I truly want . . . It would be very difficult for me to do things differently . . . and I\u2019ve always been this way . . . may all seem to be true, but they\u2019re in fact just excuses. So the business of modifying habituated thinking patterns really comes down to tossing out the same tired old excuses and examining your beliefs in a new and truthful light.In this groundbreaking work, Wayne presents a compendium of conscious and subconscious crutches employed by virtually everyone, along with ways to cast them aside once and for all. You\u2019ll learn to apply specific questions to any excuse, and then proceed through the steps of a new paradigm. The old, habituated ways of thinking will melt away as you experience the absurdity of hanging on to them. You\u2019ll ultimately realize that there are no excuses worth defending, ever, even if they\u2019ve always been part of your life\u2014and the joy of releasing them will resonate throughout your very being. When you eliminate the need to explain your shortcomings or failures, you\u2019ll awaken to the life of your dreams.\u00a0Excuses . . . Begone!",

So Daphne decides she will not be so silly any longer. She begins to be tutored in the social graces, forcing Anthony to see the beauty who has been right in front of his eyes.",

For Ky, it\u2019s no contest: Even running the prestigious Vatta Transport Ltd.   shipping concern can\u2019t hold a candle to shipping out as an officer aboard an interstellar   cruiser. It\u2019s adventure, not commerce, that stirs her soul. And despite her family\u2019s   misgivings, there can be no doubt that a Vatta in the service will prove a valuable   asset. But with a single error in judgment, it all comes crumbling down. Expelled   from the Academy in disgrace\u2013and returning home to her humiliated family, a storm   of high-profile media coverage, and the gaping void of her own future\u2013Ky is ready   to face the inevitable onslaught of anger, disappointment, even pity. But soon after   opportunity\u2019s door slams shut, Ky finds herself with a ticket to ride\u2013 and a shot   at redemption\u2013as captain of a Vatta Transport ship. It\u2019s a simple assignment: escorting   one of the Vatta fleet\u2019s oldest ships on its final voyage . . . to the scrapyard.   But keeping it simple has never been Ky\u2019s style. And even though her father has provided   a crew of seasoned veterans to baby-sit the fledgling captain on her maiden milk   run, they can\u2019t stop Ky from turning the routine mission into a risky venture\u2013in   the name of turning a profit for Vatta Transport, of course. By snapping up a lucrative   delivery contract defaulted on by a rival company, and using part of the proceeds   to upgrade her condemned vehicle, Ky aims to prove she\u2019s got more going for her than   just her family\u2019s famous name. But business will soon have to take a backseat to   bravery, when Ky\u2019s change of plans sails her and the crew straight into the middle   of a colonial war. For all her commercial savvy, it\u2019s her military training and born-soldier\u2019s   instincts that Ky will need to call on in the face of deadly combat, dangerous mercenaries,   and violent mutiny. . . .\u201cCompelling . . . a superior novel . . .
