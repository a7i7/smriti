For here all animals, from tiny wally-boos and willy-wisps to fierce predatory goblin cats, survive by telepathy, projecting images that drive humans mad.Grouped in cramped walled towns, most humans can only hide. Only the Riders, the handful chosen by the native Nighthorses, have any kind of protection. Attracted by the complexity of human thought, the most powerful Nighthorses enter the dreams of individuals, choosing their Riders, bonding them into a telepathic community. While townsfolk cower behind a religion based on fear and ignorance, Riders and their Nighthorses shield the infrastructure of human settlements, challenging the Wild.But Nighthorses are alien, not wise, and human emotions can be destructive, requiring stern discipline. Young Danny Fisher and his high-strung, obstinate horse Cloud are still learning control when Danny's hometown explodes with violence. A Rider and her mare are killed and the anguished emotions of the girl's lover, Guil Stuart, spread like a contagion to the horses. Chaos erupts and Guil is forced from the town at gunpoint.Wounded, without supplies or weapons, Guil and his sardonic, bacon-loving stallion, Burn, ride into howling winter blizzards, seeking the killer. Danny and the girl's furtive kinsmen search for Guil, unaware of the dark enemy who tracks them.",

In the face of life\u2019s struggles, how deeply we need to trust in a love greater than ourselves\u2014a love we can count on to hold us, to never let us go, and to instill in us a worth that our best efforts can never earn and our worst failings can\u2019t diminish.That\u2019s the love God has for you. It\u2019s a love that delights in you, cherishes the simple things that give you joy, meets you in the sorrows no one else can touch, and whispers your name in unguarded, unexpected moments. No one else knows you like your heavenly Father, and no one else loves you as wisely, powerfully, and completely.With sensitivity and insight, Women of Faith authors share devotional reflections on the character of God\u2019s heart. Distilled from the Bible\u2019s timeless truths and the experiences of everyday life, these meditations are like precious notes from your Father revealing the nature of his love for you. It\u2019s a love that is . . .

        "Description": "A client from a decades-old case reaches out to Boston PI Spenser-but can he rescue troubled April Kyle once more?  Longtime Spenser fans will remember that once upon a time, though not so long ago, there was a girl named April Kyle-a beautiful teenage runaway who turned to prostitution to escape her terrible family life. The book was 1982's Ceremony, and, thanks to Spenser, April escaped Boston's \"Combat Zone\" for the relative safety of a high-class New York City bordello. April resurfaced in Taming a Sea-Horse, again in dire need of Spenser's rescue-this time from the clutches of a controlling lover. But April Kyle's return in Hundred-Dollar Baby is nothing short of shocking.  When a mature, beautiful, and composed April strides into Spenser's office, the Boston PI barely hesitates before recognizing his once and future client. Now a well-established madam herself, April oversees an upscale call-girl operation in Boston's Back Bay. Still looking for Spenser's approval, it takes her a moment before she can ask him, again, for his assistance. Her business is a success; what's more, it's an all-female enterprise. Now that some men are trying to take it away from her, she needs Spenser.  April claims to be in the dark about who it is that's trying to shake her down, but with a bit of legwork and a bit more muscle, Spenser and Hawk find ties to organized crime and local kingpin Tony Marcus, as well as a scheme to franchise the operation across the country. As Spenser again plays the gallant knight, it becomes clear that April's not as innocent as she seems. In fact, she may be her own worst enemy.",

It all began in a funky brownstone on Perry Street where Gaia Moore lived with her foster family. But Gaia's little Village was brimming with people hell-bent on her own destruction, and her efforts to stay safe took her from parkside chess tournaments to greasy spoons, from the posh Upper East Side to scuzzy college dorm rooms. Along the way she managed to pick up a skate rat, a beauty queen, a hottie reformed school nerd, a recovered punk-rocker, and even a Soviet junior detective. None of whom turned out to be what he or she originally seemed....  Now, in one volume, keep pace with Gaia's latest adventures and revisit the origins of her unique story!   #27: SHOCK  When Sam disappeared, I thought the pain would kill me. Now that he's back, I'm thinking I had it wrong. The pain's not going to kill me. He is.",

In the literary community, Rorem is most famous for his diaries, five volumes of which have been published so far. These diaries combine deep honesty with the often contradictory testimony of everyday life.But if the diaries are documents of self-examination, his letters may be read as texts of self-invention, as he traces the long arc of his creative life by allowing us to join his friends on his daily journey.",

In this extraordinary book, devout Christian and internationally acclaimed   speaker, author and sports executive Pat Williams reveals the pure essence of   Jesus. Although Christianity teaches that Jesus is God, most people lose sight   of His humanity. Through the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, Williams   helps us understand who Jesus really was--His mind, His wisdom, His love, His   humility, His courage and His goodness. The story of Jesus' life is told powerfully   and dramatically and the meaning of his teachings is compellingly brought home   through contemporary stories of people who exemplify what it means to be like   Jesus. The Jesus of this book is truly the Jesus who lived and identified with us and with whom we also can identify. Williams provides persuasive and provocative insight on how to truly be like Jesus through His teachings and this living example of genuine love, forgiveness, prayer, obedience, service, humility, integrity, leadership, and more. This uncomplicated and fascinating work will enable readers to learn from Jesus'   life, understand his words and build his traits and character qualities into   their lives. The quintessential book on how to live a better life and create   a positive and lasting effect on the lives of others, How to be Like Jesus may   be the discovery of a lifetime.",

It's hard work, but Tom doesn't mind so much after he falls in love with one of the pups, a rare blue-eyed pointer Tom names Tad. It's almost as if Tad understands when Tom talks to him, especially about confusing things like how hard it is to write to Angie, a girl Tom met on vacation.   The trouble is, Grandpa promised the owner of the pup's sire the pick of the litter, and it's pretty clear that's Tad. Tom knows what he should do, but he can't help hoping there's a way to get around Grandpa's promise. How can he do the honorable thing when it will cost him what he wants most in the world?",

        "Description": "Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and author of the New York Times bestselling book Globalization and Its Discontents, Joseph E. Stiglitz here joins with fellow economist Andrew Charlton to offer a challenging and controversial argument about how globalization can actually help Third World countries to develop and prosper.In Fair Trade For All, Stiglitz and Charlton address one of the key issues facing world leaders today--how can the poorer countries of the world be helped to help themselves through freer, fairer trade? To answer this question, the authors put forward a radical and realistic new model for managing trading relationships between the richest and the poorest countries. Their approach is designed to open up markets in the interests of all nations and not just the most powerful economies, to ensure that trade promotes development, and to minimize the costs of adjustments. The book illuminates the reforms and principles upon which a successful settlement must be based.Vividly written, highly topical, and packed with insightful analyses, Fair Trade For All offers a radical new solution to the problems of world trade. It is a must read for anyone interested in globalization and development in the Third World.",
