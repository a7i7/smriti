        "Description": "Henry \"Hank\" Toohey, a thirteen-year-old altar boy, is an incessant smart-ass with a deep love of life...and other four-letter words. But with his foul mouth comes a heart of gold, and he's going to need it to get through the last weekend of summer 1984.  Everyone up and down St. Patrick Street, Henry's claustrophobic Irish-Catholic block in Philadelphia -- with its seventy-eight row homes, seventy-eight skinny mile-high lawns, seventy-eight statues of saints, and seventy-eight Mondale-Ferraro signs -- knows that the Toohey family is falling apart. Henry's mailman father is having an affair with a neighbor lady right under his mother's nose. His big brother has been a drunken mess since his girlfriend died. And his little sister is counting on him to keep her laughing through it all. But Henry has a plan to pull the family back together: He'll propose to his chain-smoking fourteen-year-old girlfriend, Grace McClain, at a neighborhood wedding. To prepare, he and his ragtag group of friends pinball around the streets, making elaborate plans for his proposal, riding bikes, rating breasts, bothering the local merchants, talking trash about Mike Schmidt and Bob Seger, and kissing behind the seafood-store dumpster.  Gritty, giddy, and bursting with Henry's boundless energy, Green Grass Grace is a heart-thumping rocket ride back to adolescence that is riotously funny and tragic at the same time.",

        "Authors": "By Berger, Lisa and Gordon, Barry",
        "Description": "In this groundbreaking and important book, Dr. Barry Gordon, one of the world's leading authorities on memory, and Lisa Berger offer a bold new synthesis of the two essential components of the human mind: intelligence and memory. Gordon and Berger argue that \"intelligent memory\" is the key to our ability to solve problems, learn from experience, associate, and innovate. As critical to the creation of works of genius as it is to navigating the complexities of daily life, intelligent memory is not an innate gift but a skill that we can learn, hone, and actually improve with age-no matter how old or absentminded we might be.  Gordon and Berger provide a concise, compelling overview of how intelligent memory functions in the brain as the \"engine\" for dynamic thought, enabling us to focus our attention, make connections, and store and retrieve information. Combining cutting-edge science with practical hands-on guidance and featuring daily exercises and self-administered tests, Intelligent Memory is an essential volume for readers of any age who want to sharpen and expand their intellectual powers.",

Her mom, Bebe, is a zillion years younger than the other mothers, still dresses like a teenager, and drives around town cranking time-warped tunes-not to mention the fact that she can't seem to forget that crazy summer she spent following the big-hair bands of the 1980s. She's held onto the mementos, the music, the memories...everything, except Trace's dad.  Trace can't help but wonder which outdated rocker in the autographed photos covering their walls might be her father. And that's not the only thing making her head spin like Bebe's old records. She's trying to keep her best friend from going off the deep end. She's desperate to do well in school. And then there's the hunky lead singer she's trying to snag-without following in her mother's footsteps.",

        "Title": "The Best Life Diet Revised and Updated",

        "Description": "From the bestselling author of Get With the Program! and Bob Greene's Total Body Makeover comes The Best Life Diet, a lifetime plan for losing weight and keeping it off.Bob Greene helped Oprah achieve her dramatic weight loss, and he can help you too. You'll eat the same delicious food that Oprah enjoys, and, just like Oprah, you'll have Bob to encourage you at every step. Unlike a celebrity, however, you don't need to hire a staff of experts to aid and advise you, because Bob's plan, easily tailored to an array of tastes, lifestyles, and activity levels, acts as your personal trainer and private nutritionist. Just open the book and let Bob help you get started down the path toward your best possible life.  What sets Bob apart from all the other experts who claim to have plans that work is that he admits that weight loss is difficult: seventeen years of watching people struggle to lose weight on a seemingly endless string of trendy crash diets, only to backslide and regain the pounds they've shed, have taught him that dropping pounds is not simply a numbers game. By acknowledging that it is not simple laziness but a complicated web of social rituals, cultural expectations, and habits that drives people to gain weight, Greene is able to attack the problem of weight loss realistically and offer not a short-lived, quick-fix formula, but a long-term program that accounts for the challenges and constraints of the real world.  Divided into three phases, The Best Life Diet gives you the tools you need to change your life. In each phase, you'll be asked to reexamine the decisions you make on a daily basis and gradually alter your habits to achieve lasting results. The book also includes easy-to-follow meal plans that make it simple to meet your daily energy and nutrient requirements, whether you are on the run and breakfast means a quick smoothie or you have time to shop for fresh produce and make something special.  You'll watch the weight disappear as you learn to prepare festive and flavorful dishes like Fire-Roasted Tomato-Shrimp Veracruz, Chicken Sausage Jambalaya, or Flank Steak with Chimichurri Topping and indulge in desserts like Roasted Peaches with Ricotta and Almonds or Apple Rhubarb Walnut Crisp. And for each delicious recipe, there is a detailed nutritional analysis, so you know exactly what you are eating and how it fits into your personal eating plan.  Most important, Bob's plan doesn't end once you've lost the weight. Instead, it gives you the tools you need to make living your best life second nature, because for Greene, a diet is not something you go \"on\" or \"off\" but a set of guidelines that will help you claim the life you deserve.",

In his bloody rise from soldier to mob boss, he encounters ever more barbaric betrayals&apos;in friendship, in his brutal business, in love&apos;yet simultaneously comes to understand the meaning of loyalty, the virtue of relationships, and gains a perspective on the lonely, if powerful, life he has chosen.As the years pass, as enemies are made and defeated, as wars are fought and won, the old don meets an abandoned boy who needs a parent as much as protection. By taking Gabe under his wing and teaching him everything he knows, Angelo Vestieri will learn, in the winter of his life, which is greater: his love for the boy he cherishes, or his need to be a gangster and to live by the savage rules he helped create.A sweeping panoramic with riveting characters, a unique understanding of the underworld philosophy, and a relentless pace, Gangster travels through the time of godfathers and goodfellas to our own world of suburban Sopranos. But this is more than just an authentic chronicle of crime. Setting a new standard for this acclaimed author, Gangster is a compassionate portrait of one man's fight against his fate&apos;and an unforgettable epic of a family, a city, a century.",

The illusion seems part political hocus-pocus and also part wishful thinking, for among many Russians Stalin is again popular; the bloody dictator can boast a two-to-one approval rating. Decidedly better than that of Renko, whose lover, Eva, has left him for Detective Nikolai Isakov, a charismatic veteran of the civil war in Chechnya, a hero of the far right and, Renko suspects, a killer for hire. The cases entwine, and Renko's quests become a personal inquiry fueled by jealousy.The investigation leads to the fields of Tver outside of Moscow, where once a million soldiers fought. There, amidst the detritus, Renko must confront the ghost of his own father, a favorite general of Stalin's. In these barren fields, patriots and shady entrepreneurs -- the Red Diggers and Black Diggers -- collect the bones, weapons and personal effects of slain World War II soldiers, and find that even among the dead there are surprises.",

Here are 115 poems from sixty poets, representing over twenty cities. These are not just poems \"about\" cities, or with the city as subject; they filter and radiate the diversity and vitality of today's cities, from the electric night of New York to the sunblanked sprawl of Los Angeles, from the factories of Pittsburgh to the waterfront of New Orleans.A kinetic mix of new voices and established writers, Walk on the Wild Side presents the timeless themes of poetry - the hunger for love, the circularity of memory, the search for renewal, and the ceremonies of life and death - through the prism of our unique urban experience. In a time when the city dominates so much of our nation's consciousness, Walk on the Wild Side illuminates the city's riches and ills.",
