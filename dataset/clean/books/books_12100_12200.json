The result is the illustrated odyssey of the fourth of seven children in the House of Yang, a prominent Manchurian family, whose experience of the Japanese occupation, the Russian onslaught upon northeastern China, and the ensuing Chinese civil war makes for a spellbinding tale.Throughout his journey, Baba's life is informed and influenced by characters both human and spiritual: the benevolent goddess Guanyin, the mystical Scholar Wang, and the vague and ominously prophetic Ma Po-po: \"In one hundred days, I will have fully become...\"In prose as vibrant as the chartreuse and vermilion of her paintings, Belle Yang has performed no less than a miracle of translation - one which compelled Amy Tan, in her preface to Baba, to write: \"Belle Yang is an American writer who writes in English and thinks in Chinese. Her writing feels Chinese... It is as though we, the readers of English, can now miraculously read Chinese.\"",

Taylor, in a book that has sold more than 300,000 copies since its original publication in 1957, has helped two generations of art students \"learn to look.\"This handy guide to the visual arts is designed to provide a comprehensive view of art, moving from the analytic study of specific works to a consideration of broad principles and technical matters. Forty-four carefully selected illustrations afford an excellent sampling of the wide range of experience awaiting the explorer.The second edition of Learning to Look includes a new chapter on twentieth-century art. Taylor's thoughtful discussion of pure forms and our responses to them gives the reader a few useful starting points for looking at art that does not reproduce nature and for understanding the distance between contemporary figurative art and reality.",

They relish the joys of family gatherings; from preparing traditional holiday meals to organizing a wedding in which each of them is given a specific task -- whether it's sewing the bridal gown or preserving pickles as a gift to the newlyweds. Bound together by recipes, reminiscences and tangled relationships, these women are the foundation of a dignified, compassionate family--one that has learned to survive the hardships of emigration and assimilation in twentieth-century America.But as the century evolves, so does each succeeding generation. As the older women keep a tight hold on the family traditions passed from mother to daughter, the younger women are dealing with more modern problems, wounds not easily healed by the advice of a local priest or a kind word from mother.Amy is separated by four generations from her great-grandmother Rose, who emigrated from Poland. Rose's daughter Helen adjusted to the family's new home in a way her mother never could, while at the same time accepting the importance of Old Country ways. But Helen's daughter Ginger finds herself suffocating within the close-knit family, the first Marchewka woman to leave Detroit for the adventure of life beyond the reach of her mother and grandmother.It's in the American West that Giner raises her daughter Amy, uprooted from the safety of kitchens perfuned by the aroma of freshly baked poppy seed cake and pierogi made by hand by generations of women. But Amy is about to realize that there may be room in her heart for both the Old World and the New.",

As the painting moves through each owner's hands, what was long hidden quietly surfaces, illuminating poignant moments in multiple lives. Susan Vreeland's characters remind us, through their love of this mysterious painting, how beauty transforms and why we reach for it, what lasts and what in our lives is singular and unforgettable.",

Theground will freeze soon. The night is cold. I canfeel it reach my skin through the glass of mywindow. My pane. My lamp. My towels.Funny how every hotel room becomes my own.My home. If only for one night.Welcome to a world set to the ever-changing rhythms of an artist's life.Since childhood, Jewel has turned to her own short stories, vivid narratives, and starkly honest writings to revisit the past, chronicle the many characters she's encountered, and trace the intricate, unpredictable patterns of her days. In Chasing Down the Dawn, recording artist, actress, and bestselling author Jewel opens her intimate journals to create a vivid montage of the people, places, relationships, and passages that colored the life she came from and marked the last magical, turbulent, and ultimately transformational year.Drawn from her remarkable chronicle of life on the road during the Spirit World Tour, this unforgettable collection of freeze-frames captures unusual images from Jewel's childhood in Alaska, her beginnings as a struggling artist, and her challenges as a daughter, sister, and woman. Jewel paints an unblinkingly honest picture of the exceptional journey that carried her to the world's stage.Here, as if pulled from a stack of snapshots, are Jewel's moment-by-moment observations on life as she now lives it: the pleasure of sold-out performances and the pressures of her industry .. the sweetness of love and bitterness of loss ... friendship, freedom, and the small miracles we ourselves create. And herein a book that allows the reader a rare glimpse of life's turning points as if viewed from over the author's shoulder -- are Jewel's deeply personal insights on the events that shaped her understanding: her parents' divorce, her experience of poverty, the healing of her difficult relationship with her father, and the development of her unique talent.With the publication of her bestselling collection of poetry, A Night Without Armor, Jewel established herself as a light on the literary horizon. With acutely observed, elegantly written depictions of the musicians, lovers, bikers, strangers, celebrities, and characters that inhabit the singer/songwriter's world, illustrated with Jewel's own drawings and never-before-seen photographs from her family archives, Chasing Down the Dawn is more than a collection of vignettes, observations, and stories. It is a finely wrought mosaic in prose and poetry, set to the rhythms of life.",

Unlike many books that are concerned with making relationships work better, Moore's new book, Soul Mates, finds meaning in endings, separations, jealousy, sexual conflicts, and other obstacles we may encounter in the pursuit of intimacy. The book emphasizes that if we are willing to live through these difficulties, life is enriched and the soul thrives. Moore describes how \"soul-intimacy\" can be cultivated in simple ways that are often overlooked - writing thoughtful letters and engaging in heartfelt conversation, for instance. On another level, he investigates ways to create soulful community and a profound sense of conviviality in society and among nations. For insight he appeals to a wide range of literature and mythology - Emily Dickinson, Sufi poetry, Native American folktales, and classical mythology. In all of these sources Moore finds intimacy depicted as a matter of soul rather that interpersonal dynamics.Everyone whose heart, mind, and soul were touched by Care of the Soul will find in Soul Mates the same kind of empathy, caring, and wisdom as Thomas Moore expands on his ideas about life and explores all human relationships.",

JourneyEveryone in Washington knows Madeleine and Jack Hunter. Maddy is an award-winning TV anchorwoman. Jack is the head of her network, an adviser to the President on media issues. To the world, theirs is a storybook marriage. Two brilliant careers. A long, loving partnership. But behind the locked doors of their lush Georgetown home, a very different story emerges. For as Maddy's career soars, a bitter edge has crept into Jack's words, a pattern of subtle put-downs, control, and jealousy that Maddy has always tried to ignore and deny. For Maddy, there are no bruises, no scars, only the daggers of fear, humiliation, and isolation. Their effect as powerful as the gun, the knife, or the fist, the wounds as deep. Through hard work, long years, and with Jack's help, Maddy has become a role model and a star. It seems impossible to believe that a woman the nation idolizes lives in degradation and fear. Only Maddy knows the terror in her heart. Her secrets are well kept, sometimes even from herself.Maddy's journey to healing begins when the President's wife offers an extraordinary opportunity, the chance to join her newly formed Commission on Violence Against Women. There, Maddy hears chilling stories from terrified wives and girlfriends that sound eerily familiar. And there she comes to know Bill Alexander, a distinguished scholar and diplomat who also works on the commission. Bill suspects that something is terribly wrong in Maddy's marriage and begs her to open her eyes. And as Maddy slowly, painfully takes the first steps toward freedom, as she and Bill grow closer, a remarkable series of events begins to unfold...a stranger from Maddy's past suddenly reappears...White House headlines bring the nation to a standstill...and a devastating tragedy occurs, forcing Maddy to realize just how much she has lost and how much has been taken from her--her confidence, her trust, her self-respect. As she is faced with the most difficult choice of her life, Maddy's extraordinary journey comes to a close, and with it comes a strength she never knew she had and a gift she never could have expected--a gift that will change her life forever.Set against a vivid backdrop of world-shattering events, Journey is a book about abuse, in its subtlest forms. The powerful effects that last a lifetime. With wisdom and compassion, bestselling novelist Danielle Steel reminds us that no one is exempt from the effects of this devastating disease, which crosses social borders, has no respect for money, power, or success. But at its core, Journey is a book about hope, about change, and about daring to be free.",

Where else could Bob Chandler make a fortune by inventing that huge-wheeled, car-crushing, eardrum-blasting behemoth of the arena - the monster truck? Where else could Carlotta Robinson become queen of the multimillion-dollar sport of. . . pig racing (\"People eat it up\")?

Only here.These are entrepreneurial pioneers all, making their way in postindustrial America with ingenuity, individuality, and often just that dash of courage/craziness necessary for those who must step outside the corporate structure and do what they want to do.With wit and warmth, in a book of pure delight, Bill Geist proves that the American dream is alive and well and just a tad warped.

Flint himself was often the star performer, and it is very clear that not all of his partners were willing.Fogarty and his friend and colleague, medical examiner Josef Tanaka, discover that the good doctor was deeply involved in the drug trade, illegally selling massive quantities of steroid drugs to hard-core body builders. In a world where total physical prowess is the ultimate goal and strength truly equals power, performance-enhancing chemicals are more than worth their weight in gold.Nothing in Fogarty's experience has prepared him for this case, where each secret he uncovers seems to lead him farther from the truth, and where the darkest secret of all is written in the blood of two drug-enhanced, steroid supermen.",

Do these relationships define three different kinds of passion for her? What, if anything, do the three men have in common that appeals to Mary? 2. In Chapter 2, Charlie has a blackout and is warned by his doctor against drinking too much. Why does Mary not seem to take this warning as a threat to her family\u2019s well-being, and possibly as a threat to her husband\u2019s life? Is Charlie correct in thinking that Mary \u201clacked the capacity to envisage disaster\u201d [p. 34]? Is she perhaps overly optimistic, or is she correct to assume that she can save him from his troubles? 3. According to Charlie, the affluent middle-class Americans he knows are suffering from \u201cfree-floating anxiety\u201d because \u201cthey appeared to be losing the Cold War, and were always aware of that awkward fact\u201d [pp. 26\u201327]. How is Charlie, as a liaison of the British Foreign Office, affected by the atmosphere of political paranoia? How serious are his professional troubles? 4. Mary responds to the news of her mother\u2019s illness courageously because \u201cshe thought, everything would be for the best after all, because no illness, no death or treacherous cruelty could be strong enough to break up a world so fortified with love or a life so diverse and rich in the sources of its contentment\u201d [p. 61]. How powerfully do events shake Mary\u2019s faith? How does this quote resonate for readers at the end of the novel? 5. How does Frank\u2019s experience as a journalist reflect the political mood of America in the 1950s and 1960s? Does Faulks imply that the government felt free to abuse the civil rights of its people at the time? Where do Frank\u2019s political sympathies lie? 6. What is striking about Faulks\u2019s portrayal of the social use of alcohol in the novel? What kinds of personal or social discomfort is alcohol being used to disguise or relieve? Does the widespread use of alcohol and cigarettes reveal an underlying unhappiness or even despair in the novel\u2019s social milieu? 7. What is at the core of Charlie\u2019s problems? Is there an external cause for his trouble, or is the trouble in his temperament, or his alcoholism? How accurate is Frank\u2019s view that \u201call Charlie\u2019s education came to nothing in the end because he could find no expression for the rage inside him. . . . It was not enough to die, there had to be self-destruction\u201d [p. 86]? 8. In his previous novels, Sebastian Faulks has shown himself to be a brilliant chronicler of the effects of war on his characters\u2019 hearts and minds. If you have read his earlier work, how is On Green Dolphin Street different? How does he portray the effects of war in a society that is, at least officially, at peace? How are the characters in this novel shaped by their historical moment? 9. How do Frank\u2019s experiences with Vietnam, the FBI, and World War II\u2014in which he killed six men\u2014affect his approach to love? He has told Roxanne, his ex-wife, that killing people \u201cfelt like everything else that happens to you. It felt like nothing at all\u201d [p. 85]. How does Frank\u2019s love for Mary change him? 10. Reviewers have commented on Faulks\u2019s ability to create convincing scenes that conjure up the sights, sounds, smells, and mood of New York and Washington in 1960. How does he create the material world of the novel? What details are used to best effect? 11. Mary realizes that Frank is \u201cme, my inner self. It\u2019s not just him that I yearn for when I call. It\u2019s myself, my previous life, my next life\u201d [p. 245]. Yet she also believes that marriage \u201cmeans that if an impossible choice is to be made\u201d between one\u2019s own life and one\u2019s husband\u2019s \u201cyou choose his\u201d [p. 313]. Does her expression of her moral dilemma in her notebook [p. 245] seem compelling because it is so realistic, or because it is so idealistic? Does her ultimate decision constitute a betrayal of her deepest self? What does she mean when she writes \u201cit\u2019s a question of being faithful to an essence\u201d [p. 245]? 12. Some characters in On Green Dolphin Street express their awareness of a kind of existential blankness that surrounds their busy lives. Frank is troubled by \u201ctime\u2019s linear, destructive rush\u201d [p. 270], but Mary sees this in more positive terms, telling Frank \u201cI want you to prove to me . . . that time doesn\u2019t matter\u201d [p. 222]. What does Mary mean by this, and is what she wants possible? 13. What are Mary\u2019s qualities as a heroine? What is admirable about her? How does her role as a wife in 1960 compare to what is expected from a wife nowadays? 14. What is the perspective on marriage expressed in Mary\u2019s thoughts in the paragraph beginning \u201cWhat does it mean to love a man\u201d [pp. 312\u201313]? When Charlie asks, \u201cWill you stay with me?\u201d [p. 313], does his question imply that he knows about Mary\u2019s affair with Frank? Is it because of her promise to Charlie at this moment that she ultimately lets go of Frank? How is the effect of this crucial exchange intensified by its setting in a seedy and frightening Moscow hotel room? 15. Why does fate take over at the end of the story? Does Faulks imply that Frank could have changed his and Mary\u2019s future if Frank\u2019s taxi had not gotten stuck in traffic? What is the view of life and love that the novel ultimately expresses?",

        "Description": "Born of the Highlands, along Pictish shores washed by the icy North Sea, Guinevere, Queen of the Dragon People, has become a woman. She has taken the power offered to her by the Dragon Throne. Now there is no turning back. In order to protect her beloved homeland from the obscene greed of the Saxon raiders, Guinevere knows she must launch an attack. The sub-chiefs refuse to fall in line with her plans (because what does this young thing, barely a woman, know of warfare?) and give her an army of the useless, the outcast, the weakest of their young boys and girls. But the war party must proceed. If it fails, the command of both land and sea will fall to the enemy.Facing her first battle against the pirates on foreign shores, and backed only by a meager band of ill-equipped fighters, Guinevere calls upon the spirits of the dead to aid her in the attack. Diving into the dark, morbid depths, Guinevere suddenly understands more of hate, love, anger, and revenge than she has ever wanted to. But the power the dead provide comes at a severe price. If she makes it through the raid, she will be a changed woman, in more ways than she can possibly imagine.Farther south, Black Leg, her childhood companion, sets out on his own. It is a quest to become a man - a man, he hopes, who will be worthy of the newly crowned Guinevere. A shapeshifter and the son of Guinevere's adoptive man-wolf father, Black Leg (soon to be Lancelot) feels he has much to learn - and even more to prove. He discovers both his inner strength and an unmitigated passion when he meets the Lady of the Lake. But the trials of his journey - both mental and physical - turn out to be more perilous with every step. And when Lancelot and Guinevere are finally reunited, the consequences of both their ordeals will unleash a torrent of anguish and desire.",

She claims to have survived the crash, and holds out a tantalizing possibility: a secret that will bring Joe peace of mind. But before he can ask any questions, she slips away.Driven now by rage (have the authorities withheld information from the families of the victims?) and a hope almost as unbearable as his grief (if there really was one survivor, could there have been others?), Joe sets out to find the woman: \"The resolution of this mystery was his mission, his purpose, and perhaps an unknowable redemption.\" But his search immediately leads him into the path of a powerful and shadowy organization hell-bent on stopping Rose before she can reveal what she knows about the crash. And Joe's connection to her - the nature of which he comes to understand only by inches - makes him part of the quarry.The novel unfolds at a heart-stopping pace as a desperate chase and a shattering emotional odyssey lead Joe to a truth that will force him to reassess everything he thought he knew about life and death - a truth that, given the chance, will rock the world and redefine the destiny of humanity.",

        "Description": "Police Heroes honors and celebrates those members of America's police force who take the oath to protect and serve seriously.  These men, women, and K-9 officers are asked to put their personal safety aside for a greater good on a daily basis, but sometimes the call of duty is above and beyond even their expectations. You're about to meet some remarkably courageous individuals, all of whom acted bravely in the most trying, life-threatening situations.Who among us can truly second guess the life-or-death decisions that police officers may be forced to make on any given day, despite the demands and frustrations of the job?  The criminals want to put the officers out of action, while law-abiding people are fearful of receiving a traffic ticket.  The politicians often exploit law enforcement issues for personal and professional gain, and everyone--including the media--Monday-morning quarterbacks the lightning-fast decisions that must be made in the field.  But it's easy to be critical when you're not the one forced to react in seconds. What would you do if you came face-to-face with a kidnapper who's holding a twelve-year-old girl at gunpoint? Alone in the Alaska wilderness, could you arrest five armed men? Would you risk your own life to save a methamphetamine manufacturer from dying in a fire he intentionally set to avoid being served a warrant? These are just a few of the heroic acts you'll read about in Police Heroes. Following the destruction of the World Trade Center, Ron Shiftan, who served as deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from 1998 to 2002, wrote this to the author: \"To those who have not come home, we say with conviction that you continue to live on in our hearts and memories.\"  And that is the very essence of Police Heroes-it will inspire you to appreciate the everyday heroes in the law enforcement community and the amazing work they do to keep us from harm and protect our way of life.",

But now they're at a crossroads where understanding may not be enough -- a place where they must risk it all to rediscover what they cherish most.  Photographer Norma Simmons-Greer has a loving husband, a lively young son, and an upper-middle-class lifestyle. Probation officer Moxie Dilliard is as dedicated to her ideals as she is to her talented teenage daughter, Zadi. Best friends after meeting in college, Norma and Moxie are each other's reality check and reassurance.  But suddenly the bond between them begins to unravel in unexpected ways. Anguished over the loss of her second child and her husband's recent withdrawal, Norma takes refuge in a complex love affair that puts her at odds with Moxie -- and with herself. Haunted by her beloved mother's inspiring yet disturbing emotional legacy, Moxie struggles to understand her friend, while her own refusal to compromise threatens to shatter her relationship with Zadi. And a devastating crisis will challenge both women to face the hardest of truths.  With insight, humor, and heartbreaking immediacy, Patricia Elam presents a beautifully written portrait of two unforgettable women, and the teenager they both cherish, as they negotiate the ever-shifting terrain of friendship and identity. A wise, tender novel of what love can and cannot survive, Breathing Room is also an exploration of how the past can at once inspire and limit us, and of the pain -- and promise -- that accompany us on the journey we all share.",

Now these changed children have reached adolescence ... and face a world that is outraged about their very existence. For these special youths, possessed of remarkable, advanced traits that mark a major turning point in human development, are also ticking time bombs harboring hosts of viruses that could exterminate the \"old\" human race.Fear and hatred of the virus children have made them a persecuted underclass, quarantined by the government in special \"schools,\" targeted by federally sanctioned bounty hunters, and demonized by hysterical segments of the population. But pockets of resistance have formed among those opposed to treating the children like dangerous diseases - and who fear the worst if the government's draconian measures are carried to their extreme.Scientists Kaye Lang and Mitch Rafelson are part of this small but determined minority. Once at the forefront of the discovery and study of the SHEVA outbreak, they now live as virtual exiles in the Virginia suburbs with their daughter, Stella - a bright, inquisitive virus child who is quickly maturing, straining to break free of the protective world her parents have built around her, and eager to seek out others of her kind.But for all their precautions, Kaye, Mitch, and Stella have not slipped below the government's radar. The agencies fanatically devoted to segregating and controlling the new-breed children monitor their every move - watching and waiting for the opportunity to strike the next blow in the escalating war to preserve \"humankind\" at any cost.",

Plays about him began being performed on Broadway in 1848 and over the years his strength and heroics took on larger-than-life proportions, much like those of Paul Bunyan. Mary Pope Osborne has honed down the legends about him to a brief, dramatic, sometimes comical, but ultimately moving text of picture book length. Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher\u2019s stunning paintings capture this 8-foot-tall superhero rushing into burning buildings, saving babies and bankers, and wolfing down the feasts bestowed upon him by the grateful citizens of old New York\u2013until the one big hotel fire after which he was never seen again. The author has included a historical note about the origins of this tall tale, and the book is dedicated to the 343 New York City firefighters who gave their lives to save others on September 11, 2001.Mary Pope Osborne included a longer, different version of this legend in her distinguished collectionAmerican Tall Tales.",

The house on Mary Street was home to Jennifer; her older brother B.J.; their hardworking father, who smelled like aftershave and read her Snow White; and their mother, who called her little daughter Sunshine and embraced Jackie Kennedy's sense of style. Through a child's eyes, the skies of Carson City were forever blue, and life was perfect -- a world of Barbies, Bewitched, and the Beatles. Even her mother's pain from her mysterious illness could be patted away with hairspray, powder, and a kiss on the cheek....But soon, everything Jennifer has come to love and rely on begins to crumble, sending her on a roller coaster of loss and loneliness. In a world unhinged by tragedy, where beautiful mothers die and families are warped by more than they can bear, a young girl must transcend a landscape of pain and mistreatment to discover her richest resource: her own unshakable will to survive.",

        "Description": "Tobacco companies had been protecting their turf for decades. They had congressmen in their pocket. They had corrupt scientists who made excuses about nicotine, cancer and addiction. They had hordes of lawyers to threaten anyoneinside the industry or outwho posed a problem. They had a whole lot of money to spend. And they were good at getting people to do what they wanted them to do. After all, they had already convinced millions of Americans to take up an addictive, unhealthy, and potentially deadly habit.David Kessler didn't care about all that. In this book he tells for the first time the thrilling detective story of how the underdog FDAwhile safeguarding the nation's food, drugs, and blood supplyfinally decided to take on one of the world's most powerful opponents, and how it won. Like A Civil Action or And the Band Played On, A Question of Intent weaves together science, law, and fascinating characters to tell an important and often unexpectedly moving story. We follow Kessler's team of investigators as they race to find the clues that will allow the FDA to assert jurisdiction over cigarettes, while the tobacco companies and their lawyers fight backhard. Full of insider information and drama, told with wit, and animated by its author's moral passion,A Question of Intent reads like a Grisham thriller, with one exceptioneverything in it is true.",

Robb Forman Dew's account of that moment in her life, and of the subsequent journey she makes with her family from confusion to a clear and powerful commitment, is a book everyone should read. In this extraordinarily honest examination of maternal, family, and community attitudes toward homosexuality, Robb Dew not only wrestles with her own mistakes and dreams, but moves us to reflect on the American attitude in general.Family happiness was a subject Robb Dew believed she understood in all its complexities - until one spring day when her son told her he was gay. In The Family Heart, she navigates deep emotional waters in order to accommodate this knowledge, turning her attention to her own husband and two sons and the events that began for them three years ago.It was a soft day in May, and her older son, Stephen, was home from his sophomore year at college when he told her, \"I think I might be gay....No, that's not what I mean. I mean I am gay.\" This moment, so difficult to remember because it left them both moving into uncharted territory, began a process of evolution in the family - of love and enlightenment and deeper acceptance that has left no family member untouched.The Family Heart is a book like no other - a supportive family memoir about a son's coming out, a book that looks deep into all our hearts.",

Cohen\u2019s wisdom and witticisms have now been collected in The Good, the Bad & the Difference, a collection of his columns as wise and funny as a combination of \u201cDear Abby,\u201d Plato, and Mel Brooks.  The columns are supplemented with second thoughts on (and sometimes complete reversals of) his original replies, follow-up notes on how his advice affected the actions of various letter writers, reactions from readers both pro and con, and observations from such \u201cguest ethicists\u201d as David Eggers and the author\u2019s mom.  Each chapter also features an \u201cEthics Pop Quiz,\u201d and readers will be invited to post their answers on the book\u2019s Web site.  The best of them will appear in a future paperback edition of the book.The Good, the Bad & the Difference is divided into seven sections: \u2022Civic Life (what we do in public)  \u2022Family Life (what we do at home)  \u2022Social Life (what we do in other people\u2019s homes) \u2022Commercial Life (what we do in situations where money is a factor)  \u2022Medical Life (the rights and obligations of patients and caregivers)  \u2022Work Life (ethics for the professional sphere)  \u2022School Life (moral questions from and about kids)Each section provides a window into how we live today, shedding light on the ways in which a more ethical approach to the decisions we make, and to our daily behavior, can make a big difference in how we feel about ourselves tomorrow.",

Matters are further complicated when it is learned that Jinx's fiance has run away with her best friend, and neither can be located for questioning.Dazed, confused, and suffering from post-traumatic amnesia, Jinx is placed in an exclusive private clinic, where she struggles to regain her memory with the help of Dr. Alan Protheroe. As their professional relationship grows and the dialogue between them deepens, Protheroe starts to see Jinx as the woman she really is: brilliant, strong-willed, and by her own admission far too proud to kill herself. At first, Jinx can remember nothing about her alleged suicide attempt. But with Protheroe's help, memories begin to surface - memories of desperation and absolute terror.",

And when Zen becomes embroiled in a romantic intrigue involving love-sick gangsters and prostitutes who pass themselves off as Albanian refugees, all Naples comes to resemble the set of the Mozart opera of the same title. Bawdy, suspenseful, and splendidly farcical, the result is an irresistible offering from a maestro of mystery.",

        "Description": "After a century of enmity between Jew and Arab, nearly three decades of occupation, and six years of a bloody intifada, Israeli leaders are doing the unthinkable - shaking hands with their Arab adversaries.In Beyond the Promised Land, Pulitzer Prize-winner Glenn Frankel unlocks these last seven turbulent years of civil unrest, political upheaval, and diplomatic crisis, in which many of the long-standing assumptions, beliefs, and practices that lay at the very heart of Israeli society were shaken, challenged, and ultimately swept aside or remade. Beginning with the Palestinian intifada, a wholly unexpected explosion of popular rage and great expectations that shattered the low-cost, low-pain status quo in which Israel and its Palestinian subjects had been frozen for twenty years, Frankel charts the rise of new political forces inside Israel, and the roles that the arrival of nearly half a million Jewish immigrants, the death of socialism, the eclipse of Arab military power, and the ascendancy of the United States all played in the remaking of the Jewish state.Frankel tells this tale through the stories of the people swept up in the change. Some characters, such as prime ministers Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin and Russian activist Natan Sharansky, are major actors whose names and faces are well known. Others, like religious party leader Arye Deri, army general Amram Mitzna, and Likud politician Dan Meridor, are known to most Israelis but are far less familiar to the outside world. And still others, like former kibbutznik Haim Goren and Palestinian academic Jad Isaac, are barely known outside their own small communities.",
