        "Description": "Candace Bushnell is turning heads . . . The New York Times bestseller, now in paperback. When Trading Up was published in July, readers from coast to coast devoured the sharp-witted, Jane Austin-esque story of Janey Wilcox's unsteady climb to the top of Manhattan's social scene. It became THE hot book--and the numbers prove it: We've sold more than 250,000 copies to date. To top it off, Candace Bushnell was the apple of the press's eye. Her signature glamour, poise, and humor lit up TV screens, newspapers, and magazines across America. While Janey Wilcox may want to be on top, it's clear that Candace Bushnell's Trading Up IS on top. With an even wider paperback audience, who knows how much higher she can climb?",

Obscure laws of finance are gratefully demystified, such as the esoteric relationship between profits (\"Sales are up and profits at an all-time high\") and actual profit-sharing (\"Now for the bad news. . . .\") There's even a section on the six danger signs of coming stress.Clever and witty, this (equal opportunity) office manual belongs on every desk, right between the white-out and the stack of reports due yesterday. 180,000 copies in print.",

It will, however, make you laugh so hard your middle actually moves (the best exercise, and possibly the only kind you'll be interested in after forty). Here, preserved for all time, are Barry's profoundest musings on such topics as how to get kids to stop smoking (eliminate tenth grade), what to do if your car is making loud noises (turn up the radio), and a solution to the battle of the sexes (let the men do housework, say, for the next six thousand years to even things up). Together they serve to expose the little insanities of everyday life and assure us that we're not completely alone in a world gone mad.",

With the author of Ironweed and Very Old Bones, and his other fable Albany sagas, you are in very good hands.This rich collection contains Kennedy's insightful book reviews over the last thirty years on such authors as Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Bernard Malamud, John O'Hara, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carolos Fuentes; literary essays on other authors and on his own writing; profiles of jazz musicians, movie stars, stories on the filming of Ironweed and The Cotton Club; and a moving soliloquy on the homeless that resonates with much force and timeliness today. Here also is Kenndy's illuminating unpublished interview with Robert Penn Warren, and his extended interview in Barcelona with Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who also provided Kennedy with two original drawings that appear in this volume (along with some choice Kennedy family photos).This sumptuous gathering of William Kennedy's work reflects his credo about nonfiction: \"I love it extremely well, I have worked in it all my writing life, and have enormous respect for its pitfalls and exotic reaches.\" You will preceive Kennedy's love of it all when you climb aboard the yellow trolley car.",

        "Title": "The Killer Strain: Anthrax and a Government Exposed",
        "Authors": "By Thompson, Marilyn W.",
        "Description": "A lethal germ is unleashed in the U.S. mail. A chain of letters spreads terror from Florida to Washington, from New York to Connecticut, from the halls of the U.S. Congress to the assembly lines of the U.S. Postal Service. Five people die and ten thousand more line up for antibiotics to protect against exposure. A government already outsmarted by the terrorist hijackers of 9/11 stumbles, leaving workers vulnerable and a diabolical killer on the loose.  The Killer Strain is the definitive account of the year in which bioterrorism became a reality in the United States, exposing failures in judgment and a flawed understanding of the anthrax bacteria's capacity to kill. With the pace and drama of fiction, this book goes behind the scenes to examine the confused, often bungled response by federal agencies to the anthrax attacks of 2001. It shows how the Bush administration's efforts to control information and downplay risk led to mistakes that ultimately cost two postal workers their lives.Based on hundreds of hours of interviews and a review of thousands of pages of government documents, The Killer Strain reveals unsung victims and heroes in the anthrax debacle. It also examines the FBI's slow-paced investigation into the crimes and the unprecedented scientific challenges posed by the case. It looks into the coincidences of timing and geography that spurred the FBI's scrutiny of Dr. Steven J. Hatfill, a key \"person of interest\" for the authorities. Hatfill, a medical researcher turned \"bioterror expert,\" proclaimed his innocence but spent most of 2002 under round-the-clock FBI surveillance.  The Killer Strain is more than a thrilling read. It is a clarion wake-up call. It shows how billions of dollarsspent and a decade of elaborate bioterror dress rehearsals meant nothing in the face of a real attack.",

In text, photographs, and nearly 100 dazzling paintings, Out of the Cradle offers a startling vision of our future in space, from the authors of the Hugo-Award nominee The Grand Tour. The full-color paintings depict the human adventure in the cosmos, with habitats and colonies offering the comforts of home, way stations and solar collectors turning vastness into territory, and robot \"astronauts\" that allow the journey into the unknown go deeper and deeper. With special attention to Mars, the Moon, and satellites Ganymede, Callisto, and Enceladus, Out of the Cradle also features a wealth of supplementary photos, charts, and diagrams.",

In his engrossing narrative, the year's personalities and events not only are themselves made vivid but also lead to wide-ranging discussions of the past and of expectations of things to come.Here, closely observed from an insider's viewpoint, are the significant matters of 1999--from the Clinton impeachment and the war in Kosovo to the mass-marketing of Viagra. Here are the people (both on and off camera) who made the news--from Slobodan Milosevi\u00b4c to Hillary Rodham Clinton to Michael Jordan to John F. Kennedy Jr. to King Hussein.And Koppel's book moves on yet another level as events trigger memories of his own past, providing a more personal resonance to his telling of the history we all share. He takes us back to the England in which he lived until he was thirteen. He revisits his powerful experiences as an interviewer investigating prison abuses and probing the violence in our schools. He discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the media; he talks about racial intolerance, about brutality toward homosexuals, about the absence of political leadership. He also examines such cultural phenomena as our obsession with celebrity and the impact of great theater and overhyped movies. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here is the voice we know from Nightline--intelligent, curious, opinionated, witty, concerned--reminding us in entertaining and thought-provoking ways that even the most public events reverberate in our private lives.",

Playing on women's compassion and ability to be hooked into \"uplifting\" stories with a moral or happy ending, American media has convinced the most well-educated, rich and healthy audience in history that they are miserable.  She dissects why: --liberal celebrities' messages aren't scrutinized and in fact presented with a halo of approval --middle class American women have been sold stress as the new scourge of modern life --media paints a negative picture of women's lives today, at exactly the moment when women have more money, privlege and choices than ever before  --the club of liberal women who run magazines and television shows have an outsize and lock-step affect on what we \"know\" about the major issues of the day--the incestuous relationship between celebrities and media has corrupted journalism --magazines rarely tell stories about the majority of women whose conservative views don't mesh with their own",

        "Description": "I don't remember Mama crying when Granny Ruth died, but the day after she was buried, Mama gathered together all the pillows in the house and went into the room where her mother's foot-pedaled sewing machine stood silent. Taking a pair of black-handled scissors, she cut open the tops of Granny's pillows. Aunt Blanche asked Mama what in Jehoshaphat's name did she think she was doing, cutting up all the pillows like that. Mama answered something about finding a crown inside one of those pillows Granny Ruth had fashioned from chicken feathers.\"Sometimes,\" she explained, \"when a person sleeps on a pillow for a long time the feathers will mold together to make a crown ...\"It's the 1960s and nine-year-old Karen Spears is living in a trailer in middle Georgia. Her father, David Spears, was killed in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, and left behind three young children and a wife with a ninth-grade education. Hero Mama is the gritty, searing, and beautifully written story of what happened to this Southern family in the aftermath of a soldier's death. At first the widow Spears appeared to fall apart -- turning herself into a beer-guzzling, good-time girl, while her children responded in kind. Eventually she recognized how much her children needed her and, with mule-headed tenacity, she earned her nursing degree and bought the family a real home fashioned from bricks, rising above her own flaws to forge a better life for her kids. Now Karen Spears Zacharias pays tribute to this woman of guts and determination -- her Hero Mama -- who battled overwhelming adversity to pull her family up and make them proud of her, and of themselves.Hero Mama is also the story of the South, where a young girl grew up against an emotionally charged landscape of racism and bigotry, where the daughter of a fallen soldier had to face the stigma of a war nobody wanted, and where a family in crisis pulled together to achieve its own version of the American dream. It is a triumphant tale of reconciliation between a daughter and her father, a daughter and her nation, and a daughter and the people of Vietnam. It is a story for any daughter who has loved her father -- and for any daughter who has had to discover how deeply her mother really loves her.",

But Dave isn't finished with them yet, not when there is Tricky Business to conduct.The Extravaganza of the Seas is a 5,000-ton cash cow, a top-heavy tub whose sole function is to carry gamblers three miles from the Florida coast, take their money, then bring them back so they can find more money. In the middle of a tropical storm one night, these are among the people who will be involved with it: Fay Benton, a single mom and cocktail waitress desperate for something to go right for a change; Johnny and the Contusions, a ship's band with so little talent they are, well, the ship's band; Arnold and Phil, two refugees from the Beaux Arts Senior Center; Lou Tarant, a wide, bald man who has killed nine people, though none recently; and an assortment of uglies with names like Tark and Kaz whose job it is to facilitate the ship's true business, which is money laundering or drug smuggling or... something.What happens to them all in the midst of the fiercest storm in years, the unpredictable ways in which this trip will change their lives and send them ricocheting off one another like a giant game of pinball, is the story of this astonishing, wickedly satisfying, all-too-human novel by \"one of the funniest writers alive\" (Carl Hiaasen).",

        "Title": "A Palestine Affair: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Wilson, Jonathan",
        "Description": "1. A Palestine Affair opens with an exposition of a marriage falling apart. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t love her anymore, though he wished that he could.\u201d The novel ends with the confirmation of another relationship ripe with pregnancy. It also opens with a murder, and ends with a death. Why does the author commence and conclude his novel this way? 2. Why does each character come to Jerusalem? Compare the various characters\u2019 memories of London with the Jerusalem in front of them\u2014the colors, the smells, the tastes. Does Jerusalem release them from the alienation and loneliness many of them experienced in London? Why do none of the main characters stay in Jerusalem? 3. Geography/land is obviously crucial to the novel. How do the different groups respond and relate to the environment? What is Bloomberg\u2019s relationship with the land, as he tries to capture the subtle tones and moods of the landscape? What is the importance of each place and its role in the novel? What are the symbolic differences between the Old City, the Transjordan desert, the port of Haifa, and the pioneer settlement where Rosa works? What significance do the landscapes hold for the story and the characters? What does the desert represent? What binds Bloomberg and Saud in the desert? 4. What is the role of women in the novel? Joyce and Mayan are the only fully developed women in this novel, apart from the absent, idealized mothers. Compare and contrast these two women. Is Joyce \u201ca chameleon\u201d? How are their relationships with men in general, and with Kirsch in particular, different? 5. Why is Joyce attracted to Kirsch? Compare/contrast him to her husband. How are the relationships different? What binds Joyce to Kirsch? And to Bloomberg? Do the events of the novel change, or shift, these ties? 6. What determines/undermines romantic attachments in this novel? Are there any fulfilled and satisfied love relationships? Why has Bloomberg fallen out of love with Joyce (\u201cHe was numb to her.\u201d)? Why is Kirsch so taken with her? What needs and motivation drew Joyce and Kirsch together? What brings Mayan and Kirsch together? What is the author saying about love? 7. Obsession with mothers is universal in this novel. Kirsch reflects on his mother often, especially when he is hospitalized. Bloomberg painted portraits of his mother when he met Joyce, and is haunted by her after her death. \u201cA man Bloomberg\u2019s age shouldn\u2019t be so damaged by the death of his mother. But he was.\u201d And on parting, Saud asks Bloomberg to visit the Arab neighborhood and convey love to his mother. Why does the author concentrate on these relationships? Why are the men pining for their mothers? What is the author saying about these men, about filial love? 8. One cannot place a novel in Jerusalem without tackling the massive and pervasive subject of religion. What is the role of religion in the novel? How does religion define each character and affect the way they interact with each other? What is significant about each character\u2019s Jewishness? What are the different groups of Jews in A Palestine Affair ? 9. What forms of prejudice and racism are present in the novel? Are they subtle or blatant? How are they manifested? What is the author saying about religious hatred? About anti-Semitism? About Jews against Jews? From where do the conflicts between the Zionists and the Orthodox Jews stem? 10. What is the relationship between the different communities? Are these tenuous or sturdy ties? Is any group represented in A Palestine Affair as more sympathetic or more innocent than another? Is there a hierarchy based on race, religion, class, gender, and/or nationality? How is the hierarchy established? Who really has power? 11. What does the novel say about the British empire as it was on the cusp of dissolving? There is much lawlessness in the novel despite the British fa\u00e7ade of orderliness and civility. Ross believes it is the \u201csacred mission\u201d of the British to \u201cmaintain the illusion that we are in control. An illusion that rests as much upon our well-deserved reputation for fairness as anything else.\u201d Yet to many British in Palestine, \u201cZionism and Arab pan-nationalism meant about as much to them as last year\u2019s snow.\u201d What are the moral strengths and weaknesses of the declining empire as portrayed in A Palestine Affair ?What does the novel say about the British empire as it was on the cusp of dissolving?

Discuss the theme of betrayal in A Palestine Affair . What types of betrayal occur over the course of the novel? Why does Kirsch betray Mayan by not introducing her to her parents\u2019 friends? Whom has Joyce betrayed? Is she betraying someone or something by not releasing Frumkin\u2019s name? Is silence a betrayal? Does Bloomberg betray Joyce by ceasing to love her and traveling to the desert alone? Does Kirsch betray the system and himself by letting Saud escape? Does Ross betray the British empire by ignoring the accelerating \u201ctinderbox\u201d situation? 14. Discuss the style, structure and descriptions of A Palestine Affair ? Is it painterly, cinematic? Why does the author start almost every chapter with a character\u2019s name? Is there a significance to the structure of the novel, the way the reader learns of the plot, to the number of chapters in the novel? 15.

        "Description": "The national treasure hunt, Antiques Roadshow is, in its third season, the most popular show on PBS. Every week it draws millions and millions of viewers to the edge of their seats as independent dealers and specialists from the country's leading auction houses appraise family heirlooms and flea market finds alike. Now this knowledge, authority, and passion is distilled in the Antiques Roadshow Primer, an introductory guide to American Antiques and collectibles.  Antiques Roadshow has taught us to look for fortunes in our attics--perhaps to find, as other lucky souls have, an Anna Poole Peale portrait miniature worth $5,000 to $7,000 or a Confederate sword worth $35,000. Focusing on 11 major areas--including Furniture, Painting, Silver, Jewelry, Porcelain, and Toys--the primer addresses the essential things buyers and collectors need to know, covering vital details for each category, such as shapes, styles, and patterns, provenance, periods, and motifs. A 32-page full-color section amplifies each chapter by illustrating numerous examples of styles and techniques, and individual items are fully identified, often with their appraised value. Above all, it helps even first-timers to answer the two key question every collector must face: Is it old? Is it valuable?",

But her secluded, bourgeois existence vanishes forever when she and her husband are summoned to the country estate of Napoleon III. Lambert's mission for the Emperor is crucial to his country's empire-building future. He and Emmeline are to travel to North Africa where, through his flawless illusionist's art, Lambert is expected to perform a near-miracle: to show the primitive Bedouins that France's power is absolute. But the Arab tribesmen are in thrall to another \"Holy God,\" an aging marabout they look upon as a living saint - and their savior. It is up to Lambert, with the help of Emmeline, to be hailed as the greater magician. Only by demonstrating irrefutable proof of his magic can Lambert help the French imperialists quash imminent rebellion and complete their conquest of Algeria.The customs and ways of the Moorish people are strange to Emmeline - and strangely liberating. Beneath the mesmerizing glare of the North African sun, she finds herself succumbing to the attentions of Colonel Deniau, the charismatic chief of the Bureau Arabe. Gradually, she begins to shed her inhibitions, along with her provincial ideas of patriotism and propriety. It is Emmeline who threatens the outcome of the French mission and risks her own life in an act of courage and betrayal that will have unforeseen and dangerous consequences, and leave her profoundly changed.Inspired by a true story, set against the breathtaking landscape of our not-too-distant past, The Magician's Wife sweeps from the splendor and pageantry of the French court to the majesty and mystery of the Sahara.",

        "Description": "America's foreign policy and military deployments remain largely unchanged despite the end of the Cold War. The expensive U.S. commitment to South Korea exemplifies Washington's outmoded strategic thinking and could easily embroil the United States in another Asian war.Doug Bandow points out that the balance of forces has shifted dramatically since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Today South Korea vastly outstrips North Korea by every measure, with twice the population, 18 times the gross domestic product, and a huge technological advantage. The South has also lured away the North's military allies - China and Russia. South Korea can now defend itself without U.S. assistance.Bandow suggests gradually withdrawing all U.S. troops from South Korea and ending the security treaty. The latter step is crucial, for only then will the United States be free of entanglement in Korean affairs and able to demobilize the military forces now necessary to back up the treaty.Bandow proposes applying the same principle elsewhere in East Asia. The threats to Japan and America's other Cold War allies have diminished while the ability of those nations to defend themselves has greatly increased. America's role should be limited to helping repel a truly hegemonic threat. Washington would thus return to the foreign policy of a republic rather than an empire, risking the lives and wealth of U.S. citizens only when their own political community was in danger.",

Every day we face an avalanche of studies and statistics that tell us what we should or shouldn't eat, how long we need to exercise, or how to protect ourselves from secondhand smoke and the harmful rays from the sun. Not only are these studies often contradictory, but the actual scientific information is usually inaccessible.Moving beyond the myths and misinformation, the advice in these pages is not based on one person's opinions or one expert's study. For the first time the research available on the health of average Americans has been distilled into one hundred essential ways that we can become healthier and happier. Each of the core findings is accompanied by a real life example showing these results in action.Eat more often. Oxford University researchers found that people who ate five or six times a day had a 5 percent lower total cholesterol than average and were 45 percent more likely to be able to sustain their target weight than people who ate once or twice a day.Who says caffeine is bad for you? The majority of scientific evidence shows that, for a healthy adult, moderate quantities of caffeine (about three cups of coffee per day) pose no significant health risks.Home sweet home. People who described their home lives as satisfying were 24 percent more likely to live beyond normal life expectancy, according to a UCLA study.",

        "Description": "Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, Plaza Suite, The Goodbye Girl, The Out-of-Towners, The Sunshine Boys - Neil Simon's plays and movies have kept many millions of people laughing for almost four decades.Since Come Blow Your Horn first opened on Broadway in 1960, few seasons have passed without the appearance of another of his laughter-filled plays, and indeed on numerous occasions two or more of his works have been running simultaneously. But his success was something Neil Simon never took for granted, nor was the talent to create laughter something that he ever treated carelessly: it took too long for him to achieve the kind of acceptance - both popular and critical - that he craved, and the path he followed frequently was pitted with hard decisions.All of Neil Simon's plays are to some extent a reflection of his life, sometimes autobiographical, other times based on the experiences of those close to him. What the reader of this warm, nostalgic memoir discovers, however, is that the plays, although grounded in Neil Simon's own experience, provide only a glimpse into the mind and soul of this very private man.In Rewrites, he tells of the painful discord he endured at home as a child, of his struggles to develop his talent as a writer, and of his insecurities when dealing with what proved to be his first great success - falling in love. Supporting players in the anecdote-filled memoir include Sid Caesar, Jerry Lewis, Walter Matthau, Robert Redford, Gwen Verdon, Bob Fosse, Maureen Stapleton, George C. Scott, Peter Sellers, and Mike Nichols. But always at center stage is his first love, his wife Joan, whose death in the early seventies devastated him, and whose love and inspiration illuminate this remarkable and revealing self-portrait.",
