        "Description": "If you're like most men, cultural demands have turned you into an emotional chameleon. You're expected to be aggressive at work, yet nurturing at home; guarded in public, but sensitive in private.Dr. Rodney Cooper calls such contradictory demands \"double binds \" - no-win situations men face every day, such as: A man's identity is reduced to the roles he plays rather than who he really is - but he can't adequately fulfill his roles without a firm sense of his true identity. The man who provides for his family hears complaints that his job keeps him from giving more of himself to his wife and children. The husband who spends all his spare time with his wife, as society expects, forfeits the benefits of friendships with other men.Men caught in double binds expend their energy trying to be everything to everyone. Consequently, they never dig deep into the heart of masculinity to discover for themselves their true identity and the freedom it brings.Fortunately, there's a way to break free from the double binds in your life. Drawing on Dr. Cooper's experience as a professional counselor to men, Double Bind first explores the most prevalent double binds men face today - including the crucial Identity Double Bind - and points to a proven path for resolving each one. Then it reveals biblical principles for living the Abundant Life: a life characterized by peace and assurance, grounded in a clear understanding of who you are and Whose you are.",

His parents instilled in their son a work ethic, sense of self, and devotion to   Church that stayed with him as he rose through the ranks of America's ruling class.   From Jesuit undergraduate schools to Harvard Law, influential law firms, Robert   McNamara's Pentagon, Lyndon Johnson's White House, and Jimmy Carter's Cabinet,   Califano was hard charging, effective, and committed to his causes\u2014whether   that meant reforming the military, working for equal rights for all, his struggle   to be a committed Catholic in America, or finally his passion to combat addictions   that ruin so many American lives.    The book is called Inside, and that's where it takes us\u2014inside   his public and private life\u2014as Califano worked in the power centers of three   Democratic administrations. He shows us how hardball is often necessary to make   government serve its people. Califano remained \"inside\" even out of   government, representing the Washington Post and Democratic Party during   Watergate.    Inside is history, memoir, and a profoundly revealing personal drama of a powerful figure involved in many defining events of the last half century. It is a tale of how ambition, tenacity and courage, guided by deeply felt ethics, can move the world, from the inside.",

        "Description": "Mr. Lincoln's Wars marks the emergence of a remarkably gifted writer. In this wildly inventive, highly ambitious collection, Adam Braver explores Abraham Lincoln's inner life and personal turmoils -- while also reflecting on the indelible impact Lincoln had on the nation during the last year of his presidency.Writing with lyrical yet muscular prose, Braver brings Abraham Lincoln to life, not just as the strong and resilient president of history books, but as a griefstricken father, heartbroken over the loss of his young son. Narrated from the multiple perspectives of Abraham Lincoln and those whose lives he touched, Mr. Lincoln's Wars shows a president who is distraught over his inability to keep his country from destroying itself through civil war and a man who is fighting inner demons during a time of great crisis.Across a rich canvas of truth and imagination, Mr. Lincoln's Wars reveals the president in his darkest hours within the White House walls. We see Lincoln as he explores the meaning of loss through a chance encounter with the father of a slain soldier. And a goodhearted young Union soldier is quickly turned into a killer in the name of President Lincoln. Finally, there is the assassination and the autopsy, as seen through the eyes of John Wilkes Booth, Mary Lincoln, the assistant surgeon general, and one of Lincoln's closest friends.Brilliant in its depiction of the country during the waning days of the war, the book is an insightful and moving exploration of the myth of celebrity and the passions it arouses. More than anything, however, Mr. Lincoln's Wars introduces a talented new writer whose storytelling ability knows no bounds.",

In exactly six days, he will take Mercury Broadband, Russia's leading media company, public on the New York Stock Exchange. But rumors of fraud have suddenly surfaced that could send the deal south. Gavallan makes a preemptive strike by dispatching his number-two man - fellow Desert Storm fighter pilot Grafton Byrnes - to Moscow to penetrate the shadowy Russian multinational. When Byrnes fails to return, Gavallen fears the worst. But the truth is even more diabolical than he can imagine.Plunging into a desperate search for his best friend, the renegade top gun is suddenly fighting a different kind of war, where there is no safe harbor and no one he can trust. Not Konstantin Kirov, the elusive head of Mercury Broadband who may not be what he seems. Not the bankers and traders Gavallan does business with every day. Not the exotic beauty who has told him all her deepest secrets - except one. Suddenly Jett finds himself trapped in a conspiracy that could shatter the delicate balance between nations - and plunge the global economy into chaos.

But for the brave ex-commando haunted by visions of war, the truth comes at a terrible price. With Mercury rising and the hours ticking down, he is moving closer to a place where murder and revenge are the currency of choice...and where the first billion is the ultimate insider secret - and the deadiest obsession of all.",

Do girls have the edge in learning to read and write?Why do boys and girls like different toys?In A Field Guide to Boys and Girls, Susan Gilbert pulls together all the latest research on gender development into a resource for parents of children from birth to adolescence. In talking to a variety of educators, psychologists, and behavioral pediatricians, Gilbert concludes that there are natural differences between boys and girls.If parents nurture the areas that may be slower to develop, such as math skills in girls and language skills in boys, they will help their children deal with gender challenges as they grow up.By combining groundbreaking inquiry with easy-to-use advice, A Field Guide to Boys and Girls helps parents bring out the best in each child.",

His credentials as a soldier were impeccable, whether he was leading troops in Vietnam, commanding hair-raising rescue operations in Somalia, or - as Commander in Chief of CENTCOM - directing strikes against Iraq and Al Qaeda. But it was as a peacemaker that he made just as great a mark - conducting dangerous troubleshooting missions all over Africa, Asia, and Europe, and then serving as Secretary of State Colin Powell's special envoy to the Middle East, before disagreements over the 2003 Iraq war and its probable aftermath caused him to resign.\" Battle Ready follows the evolution of both General Zinni and the Marine Corps, from the cauldron of Vietnam through the operational revolution of the '70s and '80s, to the new realities of the post-Cold War, post-9/11 military - a military with a radically different tools for accomplishing it. Opinions differ sharply about just what that job and those tools should be - and General Zinni makes it clear where he stands.",

        "Title": "Castro's Final Hour: The Secret Story Behind the Coming Downfall of Communist Cuba",
        "Authors": "By Oppenheimer, Andres",
        "Description": "Castro's Final Hour is the first book to describe the breakdown of Cuban communism and the gradual unraveling of Castro's three-decade hold on the island. Reported from inside Cuba by Pulitzer Prize-winning Miami Herald correspondent Andres Oppenheimer in the wake of the Soviet bloc's collapse, this is a book whose extraordinary disclosures and engrossing detail tell a remarkable story.Mr. Oppenheimer's lively narrative opens with the 1989 firing-squad execution of Cuba's most decorated army general, a hero of the Cuban Revolution. It was the first sign of a rift in Castro's ranks as glasnost and perestroika burst onto the world stage. Oppenheimer reveals the drug scandals that plagued the upper reaches of Castro's regime, and proves that there were blatantly political motivations behind subsequent executions of Fidel Castro's top military aides. From there, we are drawn into the fascinating behind-the-scenes story of the demise of Castro's dream.Among the book's astonishing revelations: How the U.S. government infiltrated the Cuban intelligence circuit with spies posing as drug smugglers, and how Americans planned the kidnapping of one of Cuba's senior cabinet ministers. How Cuba knew in advance of the U.S. invasion of Panama, and how Castro's military aid to Noriega far exceeded amounts previously reported. How Castro secretly tried to scuttle the Nicaraguan elections of 1990, and how, years earlier, Nicaragua and Cuba planned an invasion of their Central American neighbors. How Jeb Bush, President Bush's Miami-based son, and Boris Yeltsin affected, in surprising ways, U.S. policy toward Cuba. How the Cubans and Soviets despised one another despite thirty years of touted socialist brotherhood. How the Soviet pullout prompted Castro to implement his doomed survival plan--Opcion Cero, \"zero option\"--a program that would thrust Cuba back into the Middle Ages. How, in a last-ditch attempt to save the country from its dire slide in 1991, Castro's top aides pushed a never-reported plan to strip Castro of some of his powers.Oppenheimer's tireless investigative work shows us a desperate Cuba few outsiders have witnessed: the open defiance of Cuban youths, including Castro's own dissident daughter, Alina, and Che Guevara's heavy-metal punk grandson, Canek; the government's secret campaign to infiltrate Cuba's booming black magic and African cults; the unparalleled wave of male and female prostitution that transformed Cuba into a sex paradise in the early 1990s.This is a book enriched with telling and often amusing anecdotes, and is informed by more than 500 interviews inside Cuba--featuring exclusive exchanges with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, as well as Soviet officials, prominent Latin Americans, and top members of the Cuban Politburo. It is an unprecedented and intimate portrait of communism's final hour in Cuba.",

Its purpose: to help bosses stick it to their employees. Its author: none other than Dogbert, the canine corporate consultant out to rule the world.  All too often, new managers make mistakes such as rewarding good work with good pay, communicating clearly and improving departmental efficiency. Dogbert shows that this could have devastating consequences: Employees begin to expect fair treatment and compensation, productive workers show results (making managers look bad by comparison), and the department's future budget allotment could be decreased because it spends only what it needs.  Drawing from his years of experience tormenting Dilbert and advising his boss, our Machiavellian mutt uses pithy essays, illustrated by scores of comic strips, to teach neophyte managers such potent practices as:  The power of verbal instructions: Sound like a boss while maintaining complete deniability!  Empty promises of promotion: all the motivational benefits, none of the costs!  Pretending to care: Learn how to hear without listening!  Incentives: Inspire employees by giving them worthless knickknacks!  Once again firmly establishing Scott Adams as the spokesman for the absurdities of the workplace (and Dogbert as the guru of sticking it to the masses), Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook is the perfect gift for all cubicle dwellers and their bosses.",

        "Description": "Here, at last, is the groundbreaking blueprint for creating powerful relationships between mothers and daughters.History-making research has determined that adolescence is a time of crisis for girls in this country, triggering a dramatic decline of self-esteem, abandoned potential, problems with body image and sexuality, and loss of academic confidence. Beginning at ages nine and ten, our daughters are being silenced by cultural messages that ask them to become less of who they are and more of who society expects \"good girls\" to be in order to \"fit in.\"For generations, women have unwittingly betrayed those they were trying to protect - their daughters - as they have handed down the same self-negating skills they themselves were taught to get along in our patriarchal society. In doing so, mothers were being asked to bear society's messages - messages they don't agree with themselves. How many women have tried to give their daughters loving advice, only to find they sound exactly like their mothers?Creating a new alliance of mothers and daughters is essential to preserving young girls' self-esteem and reclaiming the lost voices of generations of women. Without blaming mothers or attempting to define a recipe for perfect mothering, the authors show how to transform what has been experienced as a cycle of betrayal into a powerful catalyst for change. By connecting personal with political change, this courageous book advocates changing the world for women by making peace with our mothers and joining with others to create a safe and empowering world for our daughters.",

        "Authors": "By Treacy, Michael and Wiersema, Fred",
        "Description": "Why is it that Casio can sell a calculator more cheaply than Kellogg's can sell a box of corn flakes? Why can FedEx \"absolutely, positively\" deliver your package overnight but airlines have trouble keeping track of your bags? Why does Lands' End remember your last order and even your family's clothing sizes but after ten years of membership American Express still solicits you to join?How is it that some companies are reinventing competition in their markets while others are seemingly oblivious to the changing world around them? These are the questions that authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema explore in their groundbreaking book, The Discipline of Market Leaders, from the same consulting firm that brought you business reengineering. The answers provide a revolutionary way of thinking about customers, competition, markets, and the fundamental structure of your organization.The authors' thesis is deceptively simple: that successful organizations - the market leaders - excel at delivering one type of value to their chosen customers. The key is focus. Market leaders choose a single \"value discipline\" - best total cost, best product, or best total solution - and then build their organization around it. They sustain their leadership position not by resting on their laurels, but by offering better value year after year. Choosing one discipline to master does not mean abandoning the other two, only that a company must stake its reputation - and focus its energy and assets - on a single one to achieve success over the long term. No company can reliably succeed today by trying to be all things to all customers.Through detailed case studies of some of the world's best-known companies, The Discipline of Market Leaders examines the implications of each discipline from an operating standpoint, offering step-by-step guidance on choosing and implementing the right one. Each discipline demands a distinct organizational model with its own structure, processes, information systems, management systems, and culture. Treacy and Wiersema also show how to involve every member of a company's work force in the \"cult of the customer,\" a new way of looking at work in the context of customer value.What does your company do better than anyone else? What unique value do you provide to your customers? How will you increase that value next year? If you can't easily answer these questions, then The Discipline of Market Leaders is required reading. Because the companies that can answer these questions are raising the value bar in their industries, creating new customer expectations, and staking their claim to market leadership.",

She guides you, step-by-step, to becoming your own health detective - as you discover the solution to the \"mystery\" your body is trying to tell you. Puhn shows you how to find the real clues your body is telling you to help you on your way to good health. And to ensure that health, she also includes her own unique mix of herbal remedies, food regimens, nutritional supplements, and inspiring advice.To help you visualize how apparently unconnected conditions can wreak havoc on your health, Puhn has created a remarkable device: the Body Bank. When you make deposits - in the form of supplements, specific foods, or a good night's sleep - your account grows, building a wealth of health. When you make withdrawals - some as obvious as eating too much fatty foods and some you might not even be aware of doing! - you're depleting your system and beginning to \"run in the red.\" But even if you find yourself with a full-fledged bankruptcy condition, don't despair. Puhn gives you simple, easy-to-implement solutions to bolster your entire system.",

A group of German staff officers is ready to assume leadership of the Third Reich and surrender instantly. The German SS is preparing a fortified retreat in the Bavarian Alps where Hitler may be able to carry on the war for years....The president makes the obvious but difficult decision: assassinate Hitler. Immediately.Chosen by America's OSS for this critical and dangerous mission is Captain Jack Cray, an American Army commando with a terrifying combat reputation. He is known and feared across Germany for the stealth and success of his behind-the-lines attacks. Cray is currently a POW at Colditz Castle, a grim poison for hard-core escapees. A coded message orders him to break out of the castle. As Cray fights his solitary and deadly way to Berlin, he spreads a mass of terror and disinformation across Germany.Suspecting Cray's ultimate target, SS leader Heinrich Himmler assigns one man to track Cray down and kill him: Otto Dietrich, who was chief criminal Inspector with the Berlin Police until his arrest for treason. Dietrich is now facing death in a Gestapo prison. Himmler's offer: If Dietrich finds and kills Cray, Himmler will pardon Dietrich and spare him the executioner's blade. If Dietrich fails, the penalty is death.As Cray makes his way across the ravaged landscape of war-torn Germany, he meets a fascinating cast of characters, including Katrin von Tornitz, a beautiful widow who works for the Allies, and whose life is changed when she becomes Cray's reluctant partner in the attempt on the Fuhrer's life; Sergeant Ulrich Kahr, the one man who knows the Achilles' heel of hitler's underground bunker, and whose love for his family makes him vulnerable to Cray's demand; and Hitler himself, a desperate man who can still summon up ferocious willpower.As Cray moves closer and closer to his final confrontation in Hitler's Berlin bunker, and Dietrich tracks him as he would a master criminal, a strange sympathy and understanding develop between them. One wants to kill Hitler, the other to save him - but if the death of Hitler means the end of the war, motives and goals may become tangled.",

Putting his career and family at risk, Whitacre, along with a small team of agents, tapped into secrets at  ADM that led the FBI to discover the company's scheme to steal millions of  dollars from its own customers.But as the FBI and federal prosecutors closed in on ADM, they suddenly found that everything was not all that it appeared. While Whitacre was cooperating with the Feds and playing the role of loyal company man, he also had his own agenda. Whitacre became sucked into his own world of James Bond antics, imperiling the criminal case and creating a web of deceit that left the FBI and prosecutors uncertain where the lies stopped and the truth began.Meticulously researched and richly told, The Informant re-creates the drama of the story, beginning with the secret recordings, stakeouts, and interviews with suspects and witnesses to the power struggles within ADM and its board--including the high-profile chairman Dwayne Andreas, F. Ross Johnson, and Brian Mulroney--to the big-gun Washington lawyers hired by ADM, and on up through the ranks of the Justice Department to FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno.A page-turning real-life thriller that features deadpan FBI agents, crooked executives, idealistic lawyers, and shady witnesses with an addiction to intrigue, The Informant tells an important and compelling story of power and betrayal in America",

        "Title": "Shakespeare in the Movies: From the Silent Era to Shakespeare in Love (Literary Artist's Representatives)",
        "Authors": "By Brode, Douglas",
        "Description": "Shakespeare is now enjoying perhaps his most glorious--certainly his most popular--filmic incarnation. Indeed, the Bard has been splashed across the big screen to great effect in recent adaptations ofHamlet, Henry V, Othello, Twelfth Night, Romeo and Juliet, Much Ado About Nothing, RichardII, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and of course in the hugely successful Shakespeare in Love. Unlike previous studies of Shakespeare's cinematic history, Shakespeare in the Movies proceeds chronologically, in the order that plays were written, allowing the reader to trace the development of Shakespeare as an author--and anauteur--and to see how the changing cultural climate of the Elizabethans flowered into film centuries later. Prolific film writer Douglas Brode provides historical background, production details, contemporary critical reactions, and his own incisive analysis, covering everything from the acting of Marlon Brando, Laurence Olivier, Richard Burton, and Gwyneth Paltrow, to the direction of Orson Welles, Kenneth Branagh, and others. Brode also considers the many films which, though not strict adaptations, contain significant Shakespearean content, such as West Side Story and Kurosawa'sRan and Throne of Blood. Nor does Brode ignore the ignoble treatment the master has sometimes received. We learn, for instance, that the 1929 version ofThe Taming of the Shrew (which featured the eyebrow-raising writing credit: \"By William Shakespeare, with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor\"), opens not so trippingly on the tongue--PETRUCHIO: \"Howdy Kate.\" KATE: \"Katherine to you, mug.\"For anyone wishing to cast a backward glance over the poet's film career and to better understand his current big-screen popularity, Shakespeare in the Movies is a delightful and definitive guide.",

Wine Label Language is a welcome encyclopedic reference that demystifies and explains how to interpret wine labels. Using simple terms, the book identifies and describes the various regions and appellations used on wine labels around the world. Knowing from which region a wine comes is a critical factor in determining its quality and value. This book introduces the labeling concept of the wine is from this region instead of the wine from this grape. This helps consumers identify the winemaking            areas that consistently produce superior vintages.    Newcomers to the delights of wine will learn all the basics, for instance the difference between a Bordeaux and Burgundy. Longtime wine buffs will heighten their enjoyment by understanding the differences within their favorite regions. A single region such as Bordeaux has many distinct areas or districts that affect the wine's quality and price.    Wine Label Language covers every major winemaking region of the world and explains the natural conditions and legal restrictions that each region uses to produce and name its own unique wine.",

        "Description": "There is a country where citizens are interrogated for long hours and threatened with prison or the loss of their children if they do not cooperate, where citizens are ordered to denounce others, to give information - often entirely fabricated - dispatching people to ignominy and jail. And if they refuse, they are threatened with prison.This country is America, and the subjects under attack are people who have chosen to serve their nation. They are military personnel. They are lesbians and gay men. And they are hunted day in and day out.Author Randy Shilts follows his best-seller And the Band Played On with a book of even greater power and sweep, as he investigates the situation of lesbians and gays in the military over the past three decades, revealing for the first time that some of the most celebrated soldiers in American history were homosexual (including the Father of the United States Army). Five years of interviews with nearly 1,100 gay service people have uncovered extraordinary stories of heroism, persecution, and increasing resistance while documenting the creation of a vast gay subculture within the armed forces. With thousands of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, Shilts offers the first in-depth look at the behind-the-scenes decision-making that resulted in the fierce purges of gays in the military over the past thirty years.With its epic scope this book will provide the basis of a national debate not only on the issue of lesbians and gays in the military but on the broader issue of the place of homosexuals in American life.",

        "Title": "Congressional Anecdotes",
        "Authors": "By Boller, Paul F.",
        "Description": "You can count on Congress to provide a good laugh.  Take, for instance, the Senator who talked about the war in \"Indigo China,\" or the Representative who asked why the Israelis and Arabs couldn't settle their differences \"like good Christians.\"  But the U.S. Congress has always been much more than a good source of comedy.  It has been home to brilliance as well as buffoonery, to integrity as well as corruption, to statesmanship as well as demagoguery.  And in Congressional Anecdotes, Paul F. Boller, Jr., captures it all with a sweeping, informative, and delightful look at the history of our national legislature.     A professional historian and author of the bestselling Presidential Anecdotes, Paul Boller again shows his gift for lively--and revealing--stories.  In this collection he provides a fascinating view of the history of our Congress, a history that reflects the life and character of the nation in often surprising ways.  The first Congress, for example, was serious about its task of setting precedents for the new republic, earnestly debating how the President should be addressed.  But some Congressmen erupted in laughter when Vice President John Adams proposed \"His Mighty Benign Highness,\" and they suggested in turn that Adams be hailed as \"Your Rotundity.\"  At one time dueling among members of Congress was common, and in the nineteenth century they often came to the Capitol armed with swords, pistols, and Bowie knives.  In one session, as animosities flared between North and South, a general free-for-all broke out on the House floor and ended only when one Congressman pulled off another Congressman's wig, reducing the whole House to laughter.  In the twentieth century, Boller reminds us, racial and sexual equality lagged on Capitol Hill just as it did across the country.  For a long time black Congressmen were banned from the Congressional Dining Room because of their race, and the first women members waded in male condescension.  Boller's book is filled with informative essays and entertaining stories about the sharp debates and fierce battles that took place in the nation's legislature during its first two hundred years.  It also provides fascinating insights into its leading figures:  John Randolph, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert LaFollette, Sam Rayburn, Gerald Ford, Tip O'Neill, Robert Dole.      Organizing the anecdotes by subject, Boller has written ten chapters about Congress, each of them containing essays and stories about such topics as \"Congress-Bashing\" (a practice almost as old as the Constitution itself), \"Manners and Morals,\" \"On the Floor\" (Congressional debates), \"Oratory,\" \"In the Chair\" (about Speakers and Vice Presidents), and \"Congress and the President.\"  Amusing, dramatic, and poignant, Boller's tales about Congress reveal the rich and vital past of one of America's greatest institutions, as well as the indispensable part it has played in the nation's development.",

With his sharp and knowing painter's eye, Hals observes and records the joys and hardships of his life, from marriage and family to the great tulip crash, the plague, and his continuing struggle to earn a living as a portrait artist. Emerging as a thoroughly funny, charming, energetic man, Hals reaches out from centuries past to touch and change Peter's life forever.A seamless merging of literary invention and historic fact, The Lost Diaries of Frans Hals is a remarkable, unforgettable novel.",

        "Description": "Mathematics is, Ian Stewart admits, totally unreal - an entirely mental construct. Furthermore, the complicated equations and lengthy proofs we usually identify as math are no more the essence of math than a musical score is a Beethoven symphony. Yet math is the best tool we have for understanding the world around us. By looking at the universe through mathematical eyes, we have discovered a great secret: nature's patterns are clues to the deep regularities that govern the way the world works.Mathematics is to nature as Sherlock Holmes is to evidence. It can look at a single snowflake and deduce the atomic structure of ice crystals; it can start with a violin string and uncover the existence of radio waves. And mathematics still has the power to open our eyes to new and unsuspected regularities: the secret structure of a cloud or the hidden rhythms of the weather.Nature's Numbers will equip you with a mathematician's eyes. It will take you sight-seeing in a mathematical universe. And it will change the way you view your own world.",
