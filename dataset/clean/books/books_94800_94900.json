There were always little reminders pasted on the kitchen wall. For example, the word THINK. I found THINK thumbtacked on a bulletin board in her darkroom. I saw it Scotch-taped on a pencil box she\u2019d collaged. I even found a pamphlet titled THINK on her bedside table. Mom liked to THINK. \u00a0 So begins Diane Keaton\u2019s unforgettable memoir about her mother and herself. In it you will meet the woman known to tens of millions as Annie Hall, but you will also meet, and fall in love with, her mother, the loving, complicated, always-thinking Dorothy Hall. To write about herself, Diane realized she had to write about her mother, too, and how their bond came to define both their lives. In a remarkable act of creation, Diane not only reveals herself to us, she also lets us meet in intimate detail her mother. Over the course of her life, Dorothy kept eighty-five journals\u2014literally thousands of pages\u2014in which she wrote about her marriage, her children, and, most probingly, herself. Dorothy also recorded memorable stories about Diane\u2019s grandparents. Diane has sorted through these pages to paint an unflinching portrait of her mother\u2014a woman restless with intellectual and creative energy, struggling to find an outlet for her talents\u2014as well as her entire family, recounting a story that spans four generations and nearly a hundred years.  \u00a0 More than the autobiography of a legendary actress, Then Again is a book about a very American family with very American dreams. Diane will remind you of yourself, and her bonds with her family will remind you of your own relationships with those you love the most.",

Inviting us to foster a rebirth of family, community, and civic engagement as profound as the one that won World War II, built our postwar prosperity, and ushered in the Civil Rights era, Brokaw traces the exciting, unnerving changes in modern life\u2014in values, education, public service, housing, the Internet, and more\u2014that have transformed our society in the decades since the age of thrift in which he was raised.

        "Title": "Journey into Islam: The Crisis of Globalization",
        "Authors": "By Ahmed, Akbar S.",
        "Description": "Globalization, the war on terror, and Islamic fundamentalism&#151;followed closely by a rise in Islamophobia&#151;have escalated tensions between Western nations and the Muslim world. Yet internationally renowned Islamic scholar Akbar Ahmed believes that through dialogue and understanding, these cultures can coexist peacefully and respectfully. That hope and belief result in an extraordinary journey. To learn what Muslims think and how they really view America, Ahmed traveled to the three major regions of the Muslim world the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia.  Journey into Islam: The Crisis of Globalization is the riveting story of his search for common ground. His absorbing narrative and personal photos bring the reader on a tour of Islam and its peoples.  Ahmed sought to understand the experiences and perceptions of ordinary Muslims. Visiting mosques, madrassahs, and universities, he met with people ranging from Pakastan President Pervez Musharraf to prime ministers, princes, sheikhs, professors, and students. He observed, listened, and asked them questions. For example, who inspires them? What are they reading? How do the Internet and international media impact their lives? How do they view America, the West, and changes in society?  Ahmed's anthropological expedition enjoyed extensive access to women and youths, revealing unique information on large yet often misunderstood populations. Lamentably, he found high levels of anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism and a widespread perception that Islam is under attack from the West. But he also brought back reason for hope. He returned from his groundbreaking travels both impressed with the concerned, kind nature of the individuals he encountered and invigorated with the vitality and passion they displayed. Journey into Islam makes a powerful plea for forming friendships across religion, race, and tradition to create lasting peace between Islam and the West.",

        "Description": "I wasn\u2019t afraid of death. How could I be? I lived under death\u2019s shadow every day. When you swallow eighty Vicodin, twenty sleeping pills, drink a bottle of vodka, and still survive, a certain sense of invulnerability stays with you. When you continually use drugs with the kind of reckless determination that I did, the limit to how much heroin or crack you can ingest is not defined in dollar amounts, but in the amounts your body can withstand without experiencing a seizure or respiratory failure. Yet at the end of every binge, every night of lining up six, seven, eight crack pipes and hitting them one after the other bam! bam! bam! every night of smoking and snorting bag after bag of heroin . . . after all of that, when you still wake up to see the same dirty sky over you as the night before, you start to think that instead of dying, maybe your punishment is to live---to be stuck in this purgatory of self-abuse and misery for an eternity. Sometimes you start to think that death would come as a blessed relief.Toward the end, I found myself contemplating death again. Only this time I wasn\u2019t going to leave it to chance. I was going to buy a gun, load the thing, place the barrel in my mouth, and blow my fucking brains out. I sat on my parents\u2019 sofa as I pondered this. All I needed was a gun. And then all--of my problems--would be solved.",

        "Description": "This \u201csubstantial contribution to the literature on sibling relationships\u201d (Library Journal) explores the intricacy, friction, and love in bonds between sisters. Relationships between women are often freighted with a rocky mix of emotions\u2014devotion and disregard, affection and loathing, admiration and envy\u2014leading to anguish and confusion on the playground, in the home, and in the boardroom. Negotiating her layered feelings toward a sister shapes a woman\u2019s psychology as forcefully as do her relationships with her parents. Drawing on compelling interviews and new research, Terri Apter considers the many aspects of the sister relationship from birth through adulthood. The need to fight to differentiate oneself from a sister, as well the protectiveness one feels for that same person, is explained by reference to extensive psychological and biological evidence.",

        "Authors": "By Hagerty, Barbara Bradley",
        "Description": "From the award-winning NPR religion correspondent comes a fascinating investigation of how science is seeking to answer the question that has puzzled humanity for generations: Can science explain God? Is spiritual experience real or a delusion? Are there realities that we can experience but not easily measure? Does your consciousness depend entirely on your brain, or does it extend beyond? In Fingerprints of God, award-winning journalist Barbara Bradley Hagerty delves into the discoveries science is making about how faith and spirituality affect us physically and emotionally as it attempts to understand whether the ineffable place beyond this world can be rationally -even scientifically-explained. Hagerty interviews some of the world's top scientists to describe what their groundbreaking research reveals about our human spiritual experience. From analyses of the brain functions of Buddhist monks and Carmelite nuns, to the possibilities of healing the sick through directed prayer, to what near-death experiences illuminate about the afterlife, Hagerty reaches beyond what we think we know to understand what happens to us when we believe in a higher power. Paralleling the discoveries of science is Hagerty's own account of her spiritual evolution. Raised a Christian Scientist, she was a scrupulous adherent until a small moment as an adult triggered a revaluation of her beliefs, which in turn led her to a new way of thinking about God and faith. An insightful examination of what science is learning about how and why we believe, Fingerprints of God is also a moving story of one person's search for a communion with a higher power and what she discovered on that journey.",

But the additional 20 percent that you need  to use it effectively or to apply it to special cases is conspicuously absent.  To a professional VB/VBA programmer, though, this missing 20 percent of the  language's documentation isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. And inVB & VBA in a Nutshell: The Language, it finally is available.The bulk of the book consists of an alphabetical reference to the  statements, procedures, and functions of the VB/VBA language. Each entry has a standardized listing containing the following information:Its syntax, using standard code conventionsDifferences in the operation of the keyword in a macro environment  (e.g., in Office) and in Visual Basic, if there are anyA list of arguments accepted by the function or procedure, if anyA description of the data type returned by a functionThe finer points of a keyword's usage that are often omitted from  or blurred over by the documentationTips and gotchas that include undocumented behaviors and practical applications for particular language elements -- a section particularly  invaluable for diagnosing or avoiding potential programming problemsA brief, nonobvious example that illustrates the use of the keywordAlso included in VB & VBA in a Nutshell: The Language is a brief  overview of the VB/VBA language, including:Basic VBA programming concepts, such as its data types and its support for variables, constants, and arraysError handling in VBA applicationsObject programming with VBAUsing VBA with particular applications. Excel and Project are utilized to show how to work with an application's integrated development environment  and to take advantage of its object model   Regardless of how much experience you have programming with VBA, this is the book you'll pick up time and time again both as your standard reference  guide and as a tool for troubleshooting and identifying programming problems.

Now Bethenny opens up and shares the obstacles she overcame and the great success she has enjoyed while discovering how to approach life from \u201cA Place of Yes.\u201d Bethenny\u2019s path was not always clear as she overcame a difficult childhood, failed relationships, entrepreneurial efforts that never quite got off the ground, and lifelong money struggles. To deal with these challenges, Bethenny developed ten rules for pursuing her goals with authenticity and drive, including:\u00a0\u00a0FIND YOUR TRUTH: Dig deep inside and figure out what is authentic for you, not anybody else. ACT ON IT: You don\u2019t have to have a master plan. But unless you do something, you\u2019ve done nothing. EVERYTHING\u2019S YOUR BUSINESS: Treat every job, person, and experience as if it could lead to your next big opportunity. OWN IT: If you do it, say it, think it\u2014then own it. Stand up for yourself and fully acknowledge who you really are. Each rule is illustrated with compelling, sometimes funny, sometimes outrageous examples that are pure Bethenny. It\u2019s easy to say no, to say \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d to expect the worst, and to doubt yourself. But your life can be better than \u201cnot bad\u201d or \u201cgood enough.\u201d It can be amazing.
