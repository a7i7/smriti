There is generous commentary on actors Marcello Mastroianni, Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren, and Anna Magnani, and on directors such as Roberto Rossellini, Ingmar Bergman, and Michelangelo Antonioni. Most often, Fellini speaks of the enchanting Giulietta Masina, the leading lady of many of his films and of his life.",

        "Description": "In today&#39;s fast-paced world, as we juggle family responsibilities, jobs, and social obligations, we seem to be missing out on what we fundamentally crave: a calmer, gentler, sweeter, and more gracious life. In Gracious Living in a New World, Alexandra Stoddard offers a rich assortment of ideas for achieving a gracious lifestyle. As a busy professional and dedicated wife, mother, and grandmother who revels in the energy of the city and basks in the tranquility of the village, Alexandra is uniquely poised to help us smooth the frayed edges of our lives. Positive and practical, her path toward gracious living does not require money or \"extra hands\" around the house. When we give ourselves and others positive time and space, our life expands to gracious proportions: \"We are surrounded by opportunities for living with grace\u2014our own hands and our own hearts are all the tools we&#39;ll ever need.\"",

        "Title": "Dream of Deliverance",
        "Authors": "By Harrington, Mona",
        "Description": "In this major work of historical and political analysis, Mona Harrington examines curcial missteps and uncertainties in the American statecraft from Woodrow Wilson\u2019s time to Ronald Reagan\u2019s, and traces them to a potent myth at the center of our political thinking. It is a myth peculiarly American, a long-held belief that the troubles of society can be traced to some specific \u201cevil\u201d\u2014be it a profiteering in munitions, or the multinational corporation, or the communist conspiracy, or wasteful social programs\u2014and that by smiting the evil we can achieve social well-being for all. The author demonstrates how deeply this dream of deliverance has been rooted in American culture from the very beginnings of the nation\u2014in the concept of a society in which conflicts between groups of widely divergent interests can be resolved without undeserved loss to any party. We see the consequences of this belief in our continuing tendency to oversimplify issues both domestic and foreign\u2014and in our obsessive expenditure of public energy on the search for and pursuit of the evil to be exorcised. The dilemma is further exacerbated because the country\u2019s three major economic-interest groups\u2014industrial wage earners, industrial owners and managers, and the cluster of interests tied to local economies\u2014are prone to demonologies as widely divergent as their interests, and there can seldom be agreement as to the identity of the evil. How this bondage to the dream of deliverance has affected the functioning of American government\u2014making our politics a never-ending argument whose terms have scarcely changed over the past century\u2014is brilliant explicated. Connecting the deepest workings of statecraft to what we know about the dynamics of our own individual lives, this highly original book leads us away from a myth-driven politics and toward a difficult encounter with reality, toward liberation from the endless search for the serpent whose defeat with return us to Eden, toward a national recognition that in conditions of conflict it is not always possibly for all to emerge as winners, toward the shaping of a politics that will enable us to allocate in the most decent possible way the losses that we cannot avoid.",

Madison learns that Napolean Bonaparte has forced the Spanish to turn New Orleans over to him and thereby potentially take control of the Mississippi River Valley. A country as strong as France could stop the aspiring free trade market growing on the Mississippi River, including the business of widow Danny Mulberry, a New Orleans shipping tycoon and one of the most sought after woman in New Orleans. As the young nation's hands are forced economically and politically by France, there is a movement in the Northeast to turn towards England. This could bring them under the Imperial yoke they just shook off. Suddenly the nation is a global nation, as the greatest minds and visionaries of a young America struggle to hold it together.",

In the world of politics, bitter partisanship seemingly knows no respite, and common ground between parties appears an impossible dream.Wrong! Now politicians and first ladies (and second ladies) from every part of the ideological spectrum have put aside their differences and joined together in Capitol Cuisine, a truly bipartisan and patriotic appeal to the palate. With submissions from all fifty states, this book serves up recipes from some of the most influential leaders of our country.Are you undecided as to which political party you prefer? Why not use the culinary arena as your gauge? You might compare Tipper Gores Tennessee Treats to Marilyn Quayles Peach Cobbler, or perhaps see if Senator Bob Doles Seville Shrimp measures up to Senator Edward Kennedys Cape Cod Fish Chowder. Can Alfonse D'Amato and Patricia Schroeder comfortably share a table? They can if you serve his Pepper Pork Chops with her Pasta Frittata.Reflecting the unique personal tastes and geographical backgrounds of their authors, these delicious recipes prove that even in an election year, Republicans and Democrats can agree on something--namely, that Capitol Cuisine is a winner.Other recipes include:James Exon's Bohemian Beef TeriyakiBarbara Bush's Red, White, and Blue CobblerBetty Ford's BluBanana BreadDaniel P.

When the body of the one of the students is found on the shore smothered by a fall of sand, his weathly father demands that Scotland Yard should re-examine the verdict of accidental death. Commander Dalgliesh has visited St. Anselm's in his boyhood and, as he is due for a holiday, agrees to pay a visit, expecting no more than a nostaglic return to old haunts and a straightforward examination of the evidence given at the inquest. Instead he finds himself embroiled in one of the most horrific and puzzling cases of his career. Other visitors come to the college on the weekend of his arrival, not all of them with benign intent. One of them will never leave it alive.",

        "Description": "\"We must consider that we shall be A City Upon a Hill, the eyes of all people upon us,\" John Winthrop told his Pilgrim community crossing the Atlantic to found the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Four centuries later, Americans are still building Cities Upon a Hill.  In Cities on a Hill Pulitzer Prize-winner Frances FitzGerald explores this often eccentric, sometimes prophetic inclination in America. With characteristic wit and insight she examines four radically different communities -- a fundamentalist church, a guru-inspired commune, a Sunbelt retirement city, and a gay activist community -- all embodying this visionary drive to shake the past and build anew.  Frances FitzGerald here gives eloquent voice and definition to a quintessentially American impulse. It is a resonant work of literary imagination and journalistic precision.",

Those ex-slaves were in their declining years by the time of the Great Depression, but Elizabeth Sparks, Elige Davison, and others like them nonetheless provided a priceless record of life under the yoke: where slaves lived, how they were treated, what they ate, how they worked, how they adjusted to freedom. Here, Belinda Hurmence presents the interviews of 21 former Virginia slaves. This is a companion volume to Hurmence\u2019s popular collections of North Carolina and South Carolina slave narratives, My Folks Don\u2019t Want Me to Talk About Slavery and Before Freedom, When I Just Can Remember.Belinda Hurmence was born in Oklahoma, raised in Texas, and educated at the University of Texas and Columbia University. She has written several novels for young people, including Tough Tiffany (an ALA Notable Book), A Girl Called Boy (winner of the Parents' Choice Award), Tancy (winner of a Golden Kite Award), and The Nightwalker.

        "Description": "This is the first German grammar which has been specifically designed for the adult with limited learning time who wishes to be able to express himself with reasonable accuracy, yet does not wish to be burdened with archaic, highly literary, or seldom used forms. It covers the most important points of German grammar in the clearest possible manner, stressing regularities rather than irregularities and concentrating upon the constructions and expression-modes that you would be most likely to use. It has been created for readers who prefer the phrase-approach, and all grammatical points are illustrated with phrases and sentences that you can use immediately. Hints are included throughout the book on replacing difficult constructions with easier ones.The basic presentation technique has been able to evoke the strong similarities between English and German, rather than the differences. As a result it is easier for you to understand and imitate German speech patterns. Among other unusual features of this grammar are: a means of avoiding most of the intricacies of noun declension; a logical, easily followed presentation of verbs compounded with separable or inseparable prefixes; a statement on word order that enables you to see English parallels; and an immediately useful presentation of basic German grammar.This grammar does not assume knowledge of grammatical terms (a supplement explains English grammatical terms) or of German grammar.",

In Call to Order, Smith outlines how a fairly stable period of reform in the 1950s and the early 1960s erupted into a turbulent period of reform in the 1970s. New issues spawned a variety of organized interest groups, and these, coupled with growing constituency pressures, increased the demand for members to champion causes. But floor politics in the 1980s took on a distinct character, particularly in the House. Budget politics, new procedural innovations, leadership tactics, and other developments made these years quite different from the unsettled seventies.  Smith carefully considers these changes, their relationships to one another, the new role of floor activity in both houses of Congress, and the overall implications for congressional policy making.",

The journey was a monumental one for Americans\u2014a time of bitterness and despair, of failure and hunger and want, but also of rebirth. The New Deal was part of a social revolution, a recreation of the American experiment. In popular culture, too, the decade beginning with 1929 saw a new flowering in music, in radio, and in the movies\u2014now equipped with sound tracks. In baseball, America\u2019s pastime, the decade saw the exit of the mighty Babe and the coming of the great DiMaggio and Ted Williams; the Brown Bomber, Joe Louis, dominated boxing. More ominously, overseas, dictators and militarists were on the march across Europe and Asia. Soon, Americans would be drawn into the whirlwind. Phillips\u2019s goal has been \u201cto tell you not only what happened but what it was like to be there.\u201d His sources were the files of The New York Times and the leading periodicals of the day, histories, memoirs, diaries, and government reports. Together, text and photographs offer a total historical experience of a decade in the life of a nation shadowed by depression, heading toward war, vibrating with its own frenzied excitement.",

        "Description": "This happy combination of literary essay and exceptionally well-written history, providing insights into a past still important in the twentieth century, will quickly take an honored place on the shelves of Harvardiana.Bernard Bailyn writes on the origins of Harvard and the foundations of Harvard's persistent character, structure, and style of governance, and contributes another chapter on the unhappy ending to the administration of the beloved President Kirkland (x8xo-i8z8), who presided over but could not control a period of profound change. Oscar Handlin describes the shifting relationships and power struggles among faculty, administration, and students over the years (\"Making Men of the Boys\") and Harvard's evolution from an ingrown community of teachers and students into a large, complex institution with worldwide prestige. Donald Fleming has chapters on the presidency of Charles William Eliot (\"the greatest man in the history of Harvard\") and the colorful personalities of Harvard (not only \"Copey\" and Santayana and Charles Eliot Norton, but also \"Old Sophy,\" who kept a pet chicken in his room in Holworthy). Stephan Thernstrom examines the growing diversity of the student body as to finances, geography, religion, and racial background from the eighteenth century to the 1980s.The subjects are of continuing interest not only to members of the Harvard community, who will treasure this memento of Harvard's 350th anniversary, but also to historians of higher education and ordinary readers, who will enjoy the new information, original personalities, and thoughtful perspectives the book offers.",

        "Title": "Getting Away with Murder: How Politics Is Destroying the Criminal Justice System",
        "Authors": "By Estrich, Susan",
        "Description": "Justice isn't blind. It's winking. This is the message Americans get when, against the weight of overwhelming evidence, high-profile suspects go free; when there are special sentencing rules for battered wives or adult survivors of childhood abuse; when murderers are released from prison to rape and murder again, and politicians make political hay out of these cases; when lawyers look less like servants of higher values and more like profit seekers reaping fortunes by helping clients get away with murder. This book is a penetrating look into what's wrong with the American  legal system, a devastating critique of how politics has corrupted criminal law in America.Written with clarity and simplicity, Getting Away with Murder is a lesson in how the law works and a blueprint for how it should work. Susan Estrich takes on the enflamed issues, from the O. J. Simpson trial to three strikes legislation, but pushes well beyond the soundbite answers. Drawing on her background as a lawyer, political commentator, professor, and national campaign manager for Michael Dukakis, she brings academic expertise and political experience together in a way that very few people can. In particular, Estrich argues that group-based jury nullification, like group-based abuse excuses, is precisely the wrong answer to the biases of the criminal justice system. Getting Away with Murder also views this system in the wider political arena, where fiascoes like the Willie Horton case stifle political debate and promote policies that tie the hands of judges in dealing with dangerous offenders. Lawyers do not escape Estrich's notice; she directs some of her most pointed remarks at the failure of the legal profession to tend to the ethical duties and legal values that it professes.At a time when three quarters of black Americans believe that the criminal justice system is racist and unfair; when nearly half of all whites think it's ineffective and in decline; when crime, though falling, still tops the list of public concerns, and politicians exploit public distrust of the system to get elected, Getting Away with Murder makes a statement that is powerful, controversial, and urgently needed.",

        "Title": "Fitness Is Religion Keep the Faith",
        "Authors": "By Ross, Kenneth and Kybaratas, Ray",
        "Description": "\"There are no rules. All you need is dedication.\"  These words from Madonna's introduction to Ray Kybartas's Fitness Is Religion effectively sum up the philosophy behind this renowned trainer's approach to exercise and health. In this refreshingly different book, we learn that fitness is a life's journey, a deep and soul satisfying process. No amount of discipline, self-denial or good technique can make us healthy. True fitness is the result of a joyful devotion to living a healthy lifestyle, one in which there are no rules, only guidelines?guidelines we fashion for ourselves. What we need most, as Madonna says, is dedication.   Many people feel a deep-seated discomfort with their bodies. More and more of us work in offices where physical exertion is minimal; as a result, muscles atrophy from disuse and, as Ray Kybartas points out, this disuse is reflected in our physiques, imprinted in our posture, gait, and carriage. Simply put, we live in our minds so much of the time that we often forget the maintenance of our bodies, and this neglect is unquestionably life threatening.   For Kybartas, fitness is a spiritual journey, the goal of which is health?not beauty or vanity. As he states at the outset of the book: \"Fitness is a lifelong pilgrimage. And like religious pilgrims, all who seek health must commit themselves to the journey: Those who do will find lasting results.\" Beauty is superficial and fleeting, he believes, but health is profound and lasting. Genuine beauty, according to Kybartas, is the result of a larger lifelong commitment. Those of us who undertake the journey will find enduring results. To achieve true beauty, we must look beyond it, and transform ourselves from the inside out.   And Kybartas believes that this beauty is something that everyone can possess, because it is the result of a whole and integrated person?body, mind, and spirit combined in one. Fitness, and the physical beauty that can result from it, is something you live. It is his belief that if we care for our bodies, we will also nurture our minds and spirits.   Found in Fitness Is Religion are the techniques and methods Ray Kybartas has developed over time and has used with his clients, many of whom share with Madonna the desire to maintain peak fitness while following a work schedule that frequently doesn't allow for a fixed routine of exercise.   Beginning with diet (\"food is a drug; use it wisely\") and the importance of finding just the right balance for each individual, and continuing with the importance of both aerobic and strength training (\"no mode of exercise is best, except the one you want to do\"), the book takes the reader step by step through the process of considering and evaluating the many alternatives that can lead to improved health and fitness.   With a wide range of practical how?to material, a helping of scientific theory, and examples of how his clients have adapted sound exercise and dietary principles into their lives, Kybartas provides the basic material from which anyone can fashion a personal fitness program. In this spiritual yet practical guide you will find the path to a healthy wholeness. The key to success is to remember that, as the title states, fitness is a religion, and to achieve it you've got to keep the faith.",

        "Description": "The author of the spine-tingling thrillers Days of Drums and Last Rights has written his most complex tale yet, that of an innocent caught in the vortex of international political intrigue. Powered by characters whose ambition and cunning make them intolerant of any threat to their conspiracies, Gatekeeper also features a labyrinthine stage -- from the chambers of the American embassy in Paris and the North African ghetto of Marseilles to the glittering avenues and back alleys of New York City.Hollis Fremont has recently arrived in Paris to begin her job as a \"visa slave\" at the American consulate. Her return to the City of Light forces her to revisit tragedy: the mysterious assassination of her parents by a sniper's bullets fifteen years earlier. Hollis, an unprepossessingly beautiful young woman, soon attracts the notice of Paul McGann, deputy chief of mission, whose ardent attention to Hollis is matched by his violent temper and calculating treatment of anyone who crosses his path. Hollis's involvement with McGann will accidentally reveal to her the elaborate and clandestine paragovernmental alliances colluding to create a new world order -- one in which certain high-level officials and unfortunate individuals, including Hollis herself, are set in the sights of a hired gun.This implacable killer is called the Handyman. His relentless, and anonymous, pursuit of Hollis sends her on an international flight. As she struggles to elude the Handyman and his colleagues, it becomes evident that she can trust no one, not even those whose confidences she holds most dear.From the opening scene in an assassin's hideout to the cataclysmic climax at the Statue of Liberty, Gatekeeper is electrifying. Like Mitch McDeere in The Firm, Hollis Fremont becomes snared in the carnage of a zero-sum game that is hopelessly beyond her control. In the face of murder, betrayal, and desperate ambition, her only weapon is her desire for vengeance and justice.",

        "Description": "A prominent turn-of-the-century social critic and lecturer, Charlotte Perkins Gilman is perhaps best known for her short story \"The Yellow Wallpaper,\" a chilling study of a woman's descent into insanity, and Women and Economics, a classic of feminist theory that analyzes the destructive effects of women's economic reliance on men.In Herland, a vision of a feminist utopia, Gilman employs humor to engaging effect in a story about three male explorers who stumble upon an all-female society isolated somewhere in South America. Noting the advanced state of the civilization they've encountered, the visitors set out to find some males, assuming that since the country is so civilized, \"there must be men.\" A delightful fantasy, the story enables Gilman to articulate her then-unconventional views of male-female roles and capabilities, motherhood, individuality, privacy, the sense of community, sexuality, and many other topics.Decades ahead of her time in evolving a humanistic, feminist perspective, Gilman has been rediscovered and warmly embraced by contemporary feminists. An articulate voice for both women and men oppressed by the social order of the day, she adeptly made her points with a wittiness often missing from polemical writings. This inexpensive edition of Herland will charm readers with the tale's mischievous, ironic outlook.",

What does adolescence feel like to a girl?Drawing on detailed interviews with mothers and daughters from Terri Apter's research in Great Britain and America, and from recent psychological studies of family interaction, Altered Loves is a frank, moving, and insightful examination of this crucial time in a woman's life. Apter shows that contrary to the classical view of adolescence as a stage in which daughters reject their mothers, adolescent daughters often remain strongly attached to them. The strife that characterizes this period is actually the result of trying to renegotiate a valued relationship.Beautifully written, Altered Loves explodes conventional myths and theories about mother-daughter relationships and offers new and valuable insights that will help mothers remember and daughters understand the delicate, painful, and complex process of becoming a woman.",
