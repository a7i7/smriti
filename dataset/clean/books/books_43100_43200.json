Cardiologist Bill Gavin, M.D., needed to do two things: lose weight himself and get his mother off her insulin. Using his medical knowledge and drawing on his own experience, he accomplished both his goals, developing the simplest plan yet for weight loss and long-term maintenance, with no calorie counting or food weighing. His secret:  - three meals a day - protein at every meal - no white food at night (i.e., bread, pasta, sugar, etc.)  No White at Night became a regional phenomenon when a local Seattle station picked up the story. Since then, the book has climbed the ranks of bestseller lists in the Pacific Northwest. This life-changing diet is expanded to include recipes, meal plans, and exercise programs, and is poised to reach the major national audience it deserves.",

        "Description": "***To watch videos featuring the story behind Killing Rommel, visit www.KillingRommel.com***Steven Pressfield\u2019s quintet of acclaimed, bestselling novels of ancient warfare\u2014 Gates of Fire, Tides of War, Last of the Amazons, The Virtues of War, and The Afghan Campaign\u2014 have earned him a reputation as a master chronicler of military history, a supremely literate and engaging storyteller, and an author with acute insight into the minds of men in battle. In Killing Rommel Pressfield extends his talents to the modern world with a WWII tale based on the real-life exploits of the Long Range Desert Group, an elite British special forces unit that took on the German Afrika Korps and its legendary commander, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, \"the Desert Fox.\" Autumn 1942. Hitler\u2019s legions have swept across Europe; France has fallen; Churchill and the English are isolated on their island. In North Africa, Rommel and his Panzers have routed the British Eighth Army and stand poised to overrun Egypt, Suez, and the oilfields of the Middle East. With the outcome of the war hanging in the balance, the British hatch a desperate plan\u2014send a small, highly mobile, and heavily armed force behind German lines to strike the blow that will stop the Afrika Korps in its tracks. Narrated from the point of view of a young lieutenant, Killing Rommel brings to life the flair, agility, and daring of this extraordinary secret unit, the Long Range Desert Group. Stealthy and lethal as the scorpion that serves as their insignia, they live by their motto: Non Vi Sed Arte\u2014Not by Strength, by Guile as they gather intelligence, set up ambushes, and execute raids. Killing Rommel chronicles the tactics, weaponry, and specialized skills needed for combat, under extreme desert conditions. And it captures the camaraderie of this \u201cband of brothers\u201d as they perform the acts of courage and cunning crucial to the Allies\u2019 victory in North Africa. As in all of his previous novels, Pressfield powerfully renders the drama and intensity of warfare, the bonds of men in close combat, and the surprising human emotions and frailties that come into play on the battlefield. A vivid and authoritative depiction of the desert war, Killing Rommel brilliantly dramatizes an aspect of World War II that hasn\u2019t been in the limelight since Patton. Combining scrupulous historical detail and accuracy with remarkable narrative momentum, this galvanizing novel heralds Pressfield\u2019s gift for bringing more recent history to life.",

Hawk, always proud, has never been dependent on anyone. Now he is forced to make connections: to accept the medical technology that will ensure his physical recovery, and to reinforce the tenuous emotional ties he has to those around him.  Spenser quickly learns that the Ukrainian mob is responsible for the hit, but finding a way into their tightly knit circle is not nearly so simple. Their total control of the town of Marshport, from the bodegas to the police force to the mayor's office, isn't just a sign of rampant corruption-it's a form of arrogance that only serves to ignite Hawk's desire to get even. As the body count rises, Spenser is forced to employ some questionable techniques and even more questionable hired guns while redefining his friendship with Hawk in the name of vengeance.",

On the shore of Lake Superior, a man named Vladimir Orslov is found shot dead, three holes in his head and heart, and though nobody knows why, everybody-the local cops, the FBI, and the Russians themselves-has a theory. And when it turns out he had very high government connections, that's when it hits the fan.  A Russian cop flies in from Moscow, Davenport flies in from Minneapolis, law enforcement and press types swarm the crime scene-and, in the middle of it all, there is another murder. Is there a relationship between the two? What is the Russian cop hiding from Davenport? Is she-yes, it's a woman-a cop at all? Why was the man shot with . . . fifty-year-old bullets? Before he can find the answers, Davenport will have to follow a trail back to another place, another time, and battle the shadows he discovers there-shadows that turn out to be both very real and very deadly.",

In compensating for her father\u2019s brusqueness, Noelle idolized her nurturing tomboy mother and her conservative grandma who tried to turn her into \"a little lady.\" At age 14, Noelle's mom told her the family secret straight out: \"Dad likes to wear women\u2019s clothes.\"As Noelle copes with a turbulent adolescence, further confused by the male and female role models she had as a girl, her father begins to metamorphose into the loving parent she had always longed for--only now outfitted in pedal pushers and pink lipstick. Could becoming a woman make her father a completely different person? With edgy humor, courage, and remarkable sensitivity, Noelle Howey challenges all of our beliefs in what constitutes gender and a \"normal\" family.",

In this unashamedly partisan volume, Hewitt attempts to refute the claim that no Mormon could get elected President (along with any other claim that might be made against Romney) while analyzing the former Massachusetts governor's biography and burnishing his conservative and leadership credentials. Hewitt is an agreeable, if inelegant, writer, wise enough to take detours (such as an edifying primer on Mormon history and thought) that stave off tedium. He spends far more time extolling Romney than excoriating his Republican and Democratic opponents. This is an efficient and effective exercise in political hagiography.",

The United States now has the most rapes, assaults, murders, and serial killings per capita, by a wide margin, than any other first-world nation. It\u2019s a Sprawl World After All is the first book to link America\u2019s increase in violence and the corresponding breakdown in society with the post-World War II development of suburban sprawl.Without small towns to bring people together, the unplanned growth of sprawl has left Americans isolated, alienated, and afraid of the strangers that surround them. Suburbia has substituted cars for conversation, malls for main streets, and the artificial community of television for authentic social interaction. This has resulted in dramatically negative impacts on US society, including:\u2022 The transformation of America\u2019s community-oriented small-town sensibilities into an isolated society of strangers burdened by isolation, loneliness, and depression \u2022 The emergence of a culture of incivility characterized by extreme individualism and a callous disregard for others \u2022 Levels of violence so rampant as to be proclaimed \u201cepidemic\u201d by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Advocating that urgent attention be paid to managing development by emulating the smart growth examples of European cities, the book\u2019s final section offers readers tools to rebuild community in their lives as well as in society at large. It offers practical solutions that can improve everyone\u2019s quality of life.Provocative and thoughtful, It\u2019s a Sprawl World After All also includes a helpful resource listing of organizations committed to making communities more sustainable.Douglas E. Morris is a freelance writer whose 14 years of experience living outside the United States in a number of safe urban areas has given him unique insights into cross-cultural urban comparisons.

        "Title": "The Ascent of Science",
        "Authors": "By Silver, Brian L.",
        "Description": "From the revolutionary discoveries of Galileo and Newton to the mind-bending theories of Einstein and Heisenberg, from plate tectonics to particle physics, from the origin of life to universal entropy, and from biology to cosmology, here is a sweeping, readable, and dynamic account of the whole of Western science. In the readable manner and method of Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, the late Brian L. Silver translates our most important, and often most obscure, scientific developments into a vernacular that is not only accessible and illuminating but also enjoyable. Silver makes his comprehensive case with much clarity and insight; he locates science as the apex of human reason, and reason as our best path to the truth. For all readers curious about--and especially those perhaps intimidated by--what Silver calls \"the scientific campaign up to now\" in his Preface,The Ascent of Science will be fresh, vivid, and fascinating reading.",

        "Title": "Watergate: The Presidential Scandal That Shook America",
        "Authors": "By Olson, Keith W.",
        "Description": "Arguably the greatest political scandal of twentieth-century America, the Watergate affair rocked an already divided nation to its very core, severely challenged our cherished notions about democracy, and further eroded public trust in its political leaders. The 1972 break-in at Democratic National Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel&apos;by  five men acting under the direction of a Republican president's closest aides and his staff&apos;created a constitutional crisis second only to the Civil War and ultimately toppled the Nixon presidency. With its sordid trail of illegal wiretapping, illicit fundraising, orchestrated cover-up, and destruction of evidence, it was the scandal that made every subsequent national political scandal a \"gate\" as well. A disturbing tale made famous by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in All the President's Men, the Watergate scandal has been extensively dissected and vigorously debated. Keith Olson, however, offers for the first time a \"layman's guide to Watergate,\" a concise and readable one-volume history that highlights the key actors, events, and implications in this dark drama. John Dean, John Ehrlichman, H. R. Haldeman, G. Gordon Liddy, John Mitchell, Judge John Sirica, Senator Sam Ervin, Archibald Cox, and the ghostly \"Deep Throat\" reappear here&apos;in a volume designed especially for a new generation of readers who know of Watergate only by name and for teachers looking for a straightforward summary for the classroom. Olson first recaps the events and attitudes that precipitated the break-in itself. He then analyzes the unmasking of the cover-up from both the president's and the public's perspective, showing how the skepticism of politicians and media alike gradually intensified into a full-blown challenge to Nixon's increasingly suspicious actions and explanations. Olson fully documents for the first time the key role played by Republicans in this unmasking, putting to rest charges that the \"liberal establishment\" drove Nixon from the White House. He also chronicles the snowballing public outcry (even among Nixon's supporters) for the president's removal. In a remarkable display of nonpartisan unity, leading public and private voices in Congress and the media demanded the president's resignation or impeachment. In a final chapter, Olson explores the Cold War contexts that  encouraged an American president to convince himself that the pursuit of \"national security\" trumped even the Constitution. As America approaches the thirtieth anniversary of the infamous Watergate hearings and the overreach of presidential power is again at issue, Olson's book offers a quick course on the scandal itself, a sobering reminder of the dangers of presidential arrogance, and a tribute to the ultimate triumph of government by the people.",

In 1937, while working as a biochemist at Cambridge University, he instantly fell in love with a visiting Chinese student, with whom he began a lifelong affair.He soon became fascinated with China, and his mistress swiftly persuaded the ever-enthusiastic Needham to travel to her home country, where he embarked on a series of extraordinary expeditions to the farthest frontiers of this ancient empire. He searched everywhere for evidence to bolster his conviction that the Chinese were responsible for hundreds of mankind's most familiar innovations\u2014including printing, the compass, explosives, suspension bridges, even toilet paper\u2014often centuries before the rest of the world. His thrilling and dangerous journeys, vividly recreated by Winchester, took him across war-torn China to far-flung outposts, consolidating his deep admiration for the Chinese people.After the war, Needham was determined to tell the world what he had discovered, and began writing his majestic Science and Civilisation in China, describing the country's long and astonishing history of invention and technology. By the time he died, he had produced, essentially single-handedly, seventeen immense volumes, marking him as the greatest one-man encyclopedist ever.Both epic and intimate, The Man Who Loved China tells the sweeping story of China through Needham's remarkable life. Here is an unforgettable tale of what makes men, nations, and, indeed, mankind itself great\u2014related by one of the world's inimitable storytellers.",

Here is a humorous and insightful firsthand look at how to succeed in working with Mexicans on either side of the border. Steeped in the richness of Mexican culture and history, Ned Crouch helps us understand the most critical elements that determine what works and what doesn't when Mexicans and Americans come together in business: our different views of time and space, and our construction and use of language. He debunks the 'manana' stereotype and offers specific advice on how to cross the cultural divide that separates our views on hierarchy, authority, class and gender. Real business examples and dozens of personal dialogues from a range of professions - like waiters, cab drivers, lawyers, engineers and CEOs - demonstrate common Mexican and American mindsets. Ned Crouch draws on a lifetime of experience to show how Mexicans and American gringos can engage with and enrich each other.",

He offers a genealogy of all of humanity, explaining, for instance, why everyone can claim Julius Caesar and Confucius as their forebears and how the history of the Jewish people jibes with, and diverges from, biblical accounts. He shows how groups of people differ and yet are the same, exploding the myth that human races are a biological reality while demonstrating how the accidents of history have resulted in the rich diversity of people today.Celebrating both our commonality and our variety, MAPPING HUMAN HISTORY is a masterful synthesis of the human past and present that will forever change how we think about ourselves and our relations with others.",

Stiglitz had a ringside seat for most of the major economic events of the last decade, including stints as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economist at the World Bank. Particularly concerned with the plight of the developing nations, he became increasingly disillusioned as he saw the International Monetary Fund and other major institutions put the interests of Wall Street and the financial community ahead of the poorer nations. Those seeking to understand why globalization has engendered the hostility of protesters in Seattle and Genoa will find the reasons here. While this book includes no simple formula on how to make globalization work, Stiglitz provides a reform agenda that will provoke debate for years to come. Rarely do we get such an insider's analysis of the major institutions of globalization as in this penetrating book. With a new foreword for this paperback edition.

        "Title": "Amazing Pipeline Stories: How Building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Transformed Life in America's Last Frontier",
        "Authors": "By Cole, Dermot",
        "Description": "In the 1970s, the world's largest construction companies invaded Alaska in a wild rush to build the 800-mile $8 billion trans-Alaska pipeline. Workers by the tens of thousands headed north, hoping to make their fortunes working on the pipeline, in a stampede that dramatically affected Alaska. With the avalanche of big money and new arrivals came new problems: drugs, prostitution, gambling, and violent crime. Rapid economic and social changes ultimately touched the lives of virtually every Alaskan. Nearly a quarter-century later, Fairbanks journalist Dermot Cole recalls the best of the pipeline stories with humor, authenticity, and drama.",

        "Description": "In my eyes she had always been old, always been mine, always been Granny Dan. But  in another time, another place, there had been dancing, people, laughter, love. .  . . She had had another life before she came to us, long before she came to me. .  . .   She was the cherished grandmother who sang songs in Russian, loved to roller-skate,  and spoke little of her past. But when Granny Dan died, all that remained was a box  wrapped in brown paper, tied with string. Inside, an old pair of satin toe shoes,  a gold locket, and a stack of letters tied with ribbon. It was her legacy, her secret  past, waiting to be discovered by the granddaughter who loved her but never really  knew her. It was a story waiting to be told. . . .   The year was 1902. A new century  was dawning as a motherless young girl arrived at a ballet school in St. Petersburg,  Russia, at the age of seven. By age seventeen, Danina Petroskova had become a great  ballerina, a favorite of the Czar and Czarina, who welcomed her into the heart of  the Imperial family. But events both near and far away shook the ground upon which  she danced. A war, an extraordinary man, and a devastating illness altered the course  of her life. And when revolution shattered Russia, Danina Petroskova was forced to  make a heartbreaking choice\u2014as the world around her was about to change forever.  Granny Dan is about the magic of history. In it, Danielle Steel reminds us how little  we know of those who came before us\u2014and how, if we could only glimpse into their  early lives, and see who they once were, there is so much we would understand and  learn. For in this extraordinary novel, a simple box, filled with mementos from a  grandmother, offers the greatest legacy of all: an unexpected gift of a life transformed,  a long-forgotten history of youth and beauty, love and dreams.",
