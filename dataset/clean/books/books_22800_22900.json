        "Description": "The Cluetrain Manifesto burst onto the scene in March 1999, with ninety-five theses nailed up on the Web. Within days, www.cluetrain.com had ignited a vibrant global conversation challenging sacred corporate assumptions about the very nature of business in a digital world. The Wall Street Journal called it \u201cabsolutely brilliant.\u201d Soon, executives from Fortune 500 companies everywhere were lining up to sign-on to the Manifesto. This is the book that delivers on the buzz. The Cluetrain Manifesto is a wake-up call that says business as usual is gone forever. Through the Internet, people are discovering and inventing new ways to share relevant knowledge with blinding speed. As a direct result, markets are getting smarter\u2014and getting smarter faster than most companies. Today\u2019s markets are conversations. Their members communicate in language that is natural, open, honest, direct, funny, and often shocking. Companies that aren\u2019t listening to these exchanges are missing a dire warning. Companies that aren\u2019t engaging in them are missing an unprecedented opportunity. The Cluetrain Manifesto is the culmination of this very real phenomenon. It shares powerful, firsthand experiences describing how Internet business differs radically from the corporate status quo. The fact is that employees are getting hyperlinked even as markets are. Companies need to listen carefully to both. Forget business as usual, The Cluetrain Manifesto marks the dawn of something bigger: Markets are becoming better informed, smarter, and more demanding of qualities missing from most business organizations These networked markets are conversations in which customers are intelligent human beings, not faceless demographic sectors Today, the organizational chart is hyperlinked, not hierarchical. Respect for hands-on knowledge wins over respect for abstract authority Corporations must transform themselves into organizations that establish a genuine culture with a perspective, a personality, and a point of view Linking conversations inside the company to conversations in the marketplace will create enormous new value for companies that are clued-in.",

        "Description": "Thank You for Being Such a Pain is a spiritual self-help book for dealing with difficult co-workers, neighbors, and family members. Its insights, anecdotes, and guidelines will help you to overcome the distractions and energy drain, the minor annoyances and major distress that difficult people can cause. Based on the author's popular workshops, the book includes many instructive, practical, and spiritual exercises for doing inner work, enabling you to transform your difficult encounters and relationships into surprising and powerful sources of spiritual growth.Mark Rosen shows readers how to go beyond just trying to cope with difficult people. His evocative and penetrating perspectives lead you to the deeper meanings that underlie your encounters, based on four basic premises: (1) life's seemingly random encounters are not so random; (2) pain and suffering are just as important for personal growth as love and joy; (3) learning how to transform enmity is one of life's most important lessons; and (4) healing relationship problems requires one to pay attention to the ongoing spiritual lessons that life presents.From explaining why people are difficult and how your own personality causes you to view others that way, Rosen gently leads you to a deeper understanding of the spiritual forces at work in your life. Each chapter contains a section called \"Explorations,\" composed of engaging exercises to strengthen inner knowing and change the nature of the troublesome relationship.",

        "Description": "The celebrated author of Clockers delivers his most compelling and accomplished novel to date.A white woman, her hands gashed and bloody, stumbles into an inner-city emergency room and announces that she has just been carjacked by a black man. But then comes the horrifying twist: Her young son was asleep in the back seat, and he has now disappeared into the night.So begins Richard Price's electrifying new novel, a tale set on the same turf--Dempsey, New Jersey--as Clockers. Assigned to investigate the case of Brenda Martin's missing child is detective Lorenzo Council, a local son of the very housing project targeted as the scene of the crime. Under a white-hot media glare, Lorenzo launches an all-out search for the abducted boy, even as he quietly explores a different possibility: Does Brenda Martin know a lot more about her son's disappearance than she's admitting?Right behind Lorenzo is Jesse Haus, an ambitious young reporter from the city's evening paper. Almost immediately, Jesse suspects Brenda of hiding something. Relentlessly, she works her way into the distraught mother's fragile world, befriending her even as she looks for the chance to break the biggest story of her career.As the search for the alleged carjacker intensifies, so does the simmering racial tension between Dempsey and its mostly white neighbor, Gannon. And when the Gannon police arrest a black man from Dempsey and declare him a suspect, the animosity between the two cities threatens to boil over into violence. With the media swarming and the mood turning increasingly ugly, Lorenzo must take desperate measures to get to the bottom of Brenda Martin's story.At once a suspenseful mystery and a brilliant portrait of two cities locked in a death-grip of explosive rage, Freedomland reveals the heart of the urban American experience--dislocated, furious, yearning--as never before. Richard Price has created a vibrant, gut-wrenching masterpiece whose images will remain long after the final, devastating pages.",

Paris gallery owner and editor, Viviane Esders, offered each photographer the opportunity to fill a double page spread with words and pictures describing her mother. All of the participants presented Esders with a unique artistic capsule that illustrates the indestructible bond between mother and daughter. Some provided their own portraits, others submitted a beloved family photograph - often of a beautiful young woman before she became a mother - and a few created a work of art to best symbolize their perception of mother.These seventy-two personal statements illuminate the magical, often mystical, sometimes emotional, but always fascinating relationships between mothers and daughters. And the international quality of these portraits reinforces the universality of such relationships.",

Noted for her rich, intricate plots, and distinguished for her sensitive, insightful portrayals of male-female relationships, McGown is no longer merely a writer to watch, but an author who has hit a remarkable stride. Witness A Shred of Evidence, her terrifying new novel about chilling passion and psychotic obsession.Although the beginning of the new term at Oakland School in Stansfield, England, seems much as usual, it isn't. Handsome physical education instructor Colin Cochrane has just received yet another steamy anonymous letter. His wife is not amused. And a good-looking new English teacher, Patrick Murray, has joined the staff, fresh from a bit of trouble at his last school. Between them, Patrick and Colin provide abundant inspiration for adolescent sexual fantasies--which unfortunately become a twisted, tragic reality when fifteen-year-old Natalie Ouspensky is strangled, having first been (possibly) raped as well.Although Detective Inspector Judy Hill and Detective Chief Inspector Lloyd are certain that Natalie's killer is someone from Oakland School, they have their work cut out making certain just who. For Natalie wasn't quite the innocent her mother believes, and her classmates guard Natalie's secrets--and their own--like life itself.It would be so easy for Hill and Lloyd to make an arrest, and so likely that they'd be wrong. For once the odds are that a killer will slip right through their fingers, until a shred of evidence points them in the right direction. . . .",

Now Martini crafts yet another legal nail-biter featuring perennial favorite attorney Paul Madriani.  After a lawyer friend is killed along with his client in a hail of gunfire outside the federal courthouse in San Diego, Madriani takes on another client who he believes is involved at the edges of the double murder. He takes the case not to defend the man, but to find out who killed his friend and why. Madriani is tortured by questions of conflict, his duty to a client who may have killed his friend, and the need to know the truth, wondering whether he himself had been marked for death only to have a friend die in his place. Soon he is drawn into a vortex of crime that spans the Americas.  As he searches for the killer, Madriani rides the crest of a dangerous wave of international drug deals and people who murder for money. Suddenly he realizes it is not heroin or cocaine that resulted in the murder of his friend, but a priceless piece of pre-Columbian art-something so dazzling in the information it holds as to be one of the treasures of the ages.  In a quest that takes Madriani from California to Mexico and the Guatemalan border, he discovers that while the motive to kill may be driven by distant, exotic, and ancient artifacts, the killer, like a serpent, lies much closer at hand.",

In this sanctuary, she hopes to escape her past - the violence and the death that for years were her constant companions. Most of all, she wants to forget Martin Kessler, the dangerous hero of a now-lost cause - who will always own a piece of Elizabeth's soul. For Martin's love is a continuing reminder of what Elizabeth once was: the woman they called \"Black Angel,\" a ruthless and efficient assassin.Her fury was born in a merciless Middle Eastern prison, where as an American she was detained for crimes she did not commit. She escaped with her life, and by the age of twenty-six, she was already worth $1 million dead. But Martin Kessler, himself hunted, touched her heart with unfamiliar tenderness. Now he has returned to bring Elizabeth's protective wall of anonymity crashing down.A teenage girl is about to be kidnapped from an exclusive island tennis club - a girl who unwittingly holds the key to a planned act of terrorism so horrific that an all-out war could be the only result. For Martin, a man who never learned how to lay low, curiosity will get the better of him. And for Elizabeth, whose sense of justice is equaled only by her hatred of those who would pervert it, a child's safety is inviolable - and worthy of the sacrifice of the new life she has so scrupulously constructed.By joining forces in the daring rescue of the girl, Elizabeth and Martin will be forced to put their fate in each other's hands one last time - and decide once and for all whether they must live together or apart. In doing so they will also be drawn again into a violent struggle - a secret war of fanaticism, greed and doomsday technology.",

In the wake of the last decade\u2019s rush to invest by millions of households and Wall Street\u2019s obsession with short-term performance, a culture of gamesmanship has grown among corporate management, financial analysts, brokers, and fund managers, making it hard to tell financial fantasy from reality, salesmanship from honest advice.In Take on the Street, Arthur Levitt\u2014former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2014shows how you can take matters into your own hands. At once anecdotal (names are named), informative, and prescriptive, Take on the Street expounds on, among other subjects: the relationship between broker compensation and your trading account; the conflicts of interest inherent in buy-hold-or-sell recommendations of analysts; what exactly happens\u2014and who gets a piece of the action\u2014when you place an order; the \u201cseven deadly sins\u201d of mutual funds; the vagaries and vicissitudes of 401(k) investments; how accountants engage in sleight of hand to fake impressive company performance; how to find the truth in a company\u2019s financial statements; the real reason for the Street\u2019s hostility to full disclosure; the crisis in corporate governance,  and, given these shenanigans and double-dealings, what specific steps you can take to safeguard your financial future.With integrity and authority, Levitt gives us a bracing primer on the collapse of the system for overseeing our capital markets, and sage, essential advice on a discipline we often ignore to our peril\u2014how not to lose money.",

        "Description": "Paul Gauguin fled what he called \"filthy Europe\" in 1891 to what he hoped would be an unspoiled paradise, Tahiti. He painted 66 magnificent can vases during the first two years he spent there and kept notes from which he later wrote Noa Noa \u2014 a journal recording his thoughts and impressions of that time.Noa Noa \u2014 the most widely known of Gauguin's writings \u2014 is reproduced here from a rare early edition (1919), in a lucid translation capturing the artist's unpretentious style. Page after page reveals Gauguin's keen observations of Tahiti and its people, and his passionate struggle to achieve the inner harmony he expressed so profoundly on canvas. Gauguin's prose is as seductive as his paintings, filled with descriptions of warm seas, hidden lagoons, lush green forests, and beautiful Maori women.The journal is captivating reading, offering a compelling autobiographical fragment of the soul of a genius and a rare glimpse of Oceanian culture. The brief periods of happiness Gauguin found among the Tahitians are eloquently expressed in his narrative. We understand the motives that drove him and gain a deeper appreciation of his art.Today the manuscript provides unparalleled insight into Gauguin's thoughts as he strove to achieve spiritual peace, and into the wellsprings of a singular artistic style which changed the course of modern art. This wonderfully affordable edition \u2014 enhanced by 24 of Gauguin's South Seas drawings \u2014 makes a unique and passionate testament accessible to all art lovers.",

        "Authors": "By Porterfield, Amanda",
        "Description": "As recently as a few decades ago, most people would have described America as a predominantly Protestant nation. Today, we are home to a colorful mix of religious faiths and practices, from a resurgent Catholic Church and a rapidly growing Islam to all forms of Buddhism and many other non-Christian religions. How did this startling transformation take place? A great many factors contributed to this transformation, writes Amanda Porterfield in this engaging look at religion in contemporary America. Religious activism, disillusionment with American culture stemming from the Vietnam war, the influx of Buddhist ideas, a heightened consciousness of gender, and the vastly broadened awareness of non-Christian religions arising from the growth of religious studies programs--all have served to undermine Protestant hegemony in the United States. But the single most important factor, says Porterfield, was the very success of Protestant ways of thinking: emphasis on the individual's relationship with God, tension between spiritual life and religious institutions, egalitarian ideas about spiritual life, and belief in the practical benefits of spirituality. Distrust of religious institutions, for instance, helped fuel a religious counterculture--the tendency to define spiritual truth against the dangers or inadequacies of the surrounding culture--and Protestantism's pragmatic view of spirituality played into the tendency to see the main function of religion as therapeutic.  For anyone interested in how and why the American religious landscape has been so dramatically altered in the last forty years, The Transformation of Religion in America offers a coherent and persuasive analysis.",

        "Title": "The IMMORTALS",
        "Authors": "By Korda, Michael",
        "Description": "Jack Kennedy - the American hero.Marilyn Monroe - the love goddess.Their affair has been whispered about for thirty years. Now, at last, the story we have only been able to imagine is brought to vibrant, stunning life - a passionate, tragic romance played out against a background of deadly intrigue, power politics, and Hollywood glamour on a grand scale.Only Michael Korda, best-selling author of Queenie and The Fortune could so convincingly portray characters already larger than life, and a story more complex, more resonantly true than any rumor or speculation.At the center of this extraordinary novel is Marilyn - not the \"dumb blonde\" of Hollywood legend, but a woman who explodes from the page with great strength - deeply passionate, funny, outrageous, often life-loving, but with a fatal inability to hold on to happiness even when it is within her grasp. When she meets the young Senator John F. Kennedy at a Beverly Hills party, it is, for both of them, love at first sight - the beginning of an affair that will become political dynamite in the hands of a rogues' gallery of politicians and criminals.The cast of characters is dazzling, fascinating, audaciously imagined. Jack Kennedy, charming, fatally ambitious, capable at once of great passion and cold political calculation; Bobby Kennedy, whose reputation for ruthlessness conceals a sensitive and tender nature, and who finally (and with fatal consequences) replaces his brother in Marilyn's life; J. Edgar Hoover, who uses his knowledge of the affair for his own purposes; Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamster leader, whose taping of the lovers' most intimate erotic moments sets off a chain of events that ends in Marilyn's death and Jack Kennedy's assassination; crime bosses Santo Trafficante, Carlos Marcello, and Sam Giancana, all of them in on the secret....Michael Korda has written the story behind the myth that has become the fabric of our national imagination, holding nothing back, revealing at last the missing element in three legendary lives, the one thing we have always wanted to know - the truth about Marilyn, Jack and Bobby.",
