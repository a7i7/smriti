        "Authors": "By Wheeler, Sara",
        "Description": "It is the coldest, windiest, driest place on earth, an icy desert of unearthly beauty and stubborn impenetrability. For centuries, Antarctica has captured the imagination of our greatest scientists and explorers, lingering in the spirit long after their return. Shackleton called it \"the last great journey\"; for Apsley Cherry-Garrard it was the worst journey in the world. This is a book about the call of the wild and the response of the spirit to a country that exists perhaps most vividly in the mind. Sara Wheeler spent seven months in Antarctica, living with its scientists and dreamers. No book is more true to the spirit of that continent--beguiling, enchanted and vast beyond the furthest reaches of our imagination. Chosen by Beryl Bainbridge and John Major as one of the best books of the year, recommended by the editors of Entertainment Weekly and the Chicago Tribune, one of the Seattle Times's top ten travel books of the year, Terra Incognita is a classic of polar literature.",

And, having learned well from their long-dead masters, they've established a hierarchical society - one with humanoid aristo-rulers at the top and slave-chipped workers at the bottom, performing the lowly tasks all androids were originally created to do.Freya, designed as a concubine for a species that hasn't existed for two hundred years, falls somewhere in the middle. She's been a tour guide and an escort, but jobs are scarce for a 'bot with a useless skill set. So when a mysterious stranger offers to pay her well to deliver a small package from Mercury to Mars, she readily accepts.Unfortunately for Freya, she has just made herself a moving target.

In this other universe everyone seems mad and everything is upside down, back to front and infuriatingly bizarre . . .\u201dIn her twenties Sarah Macdonald backpacked around India and came away with a lasting impression of heat, pollution, and poverty. So when an airport beggar read her palm and told her she would return to India -- and for love -- she screamed, \u201cNever!\u201d and gave the country, and him, the finger.But eleven years later, the prophecy comes true. When the love of Macdonald\u2019s life is posted to India, she quits her dream job to move to the most polluted city on earth, New Delhi. For Macdonald this seems like the ultimate sacrifice for love, and it almost kills her, literally. Just settled, she falls dangerously ill with double pneumonia, an experience that compels her to face some serious questions about her own fragile mortality and inner spiritual void. \u201cI must find peace in the only place possible in India,\u201d she concludes. \u201cWithin.\u201d Thus begins her journey of discovery through India in search of the meaning of life and death. Holy Cow is Sarah Macdonald\u2019s often hilarious chronicle of her adventures in a land of chaos and contradiction, of encounters with Hinduism, Islam and Jainism, Sufis, Sikhs, Parsis, and Christians, and a kaleidoscope of yogis, swamis, and Bollywood stars. From spiritual retreats and crumbling nirvanas to war zones and New Delhi nightclubs, it is a journey that only a woman on a mission to save her soul, her love life -- and her sanity -- can survive.",

        "Description": "This New Edition of the foundational work on soft tissue massage has been completely updated and revised to provide a convenient reference source that integrates theory with practice. The 4th Edition continues to follow classic Swedish remedial massage therapy, along with the Hoffa System of local and general massage. It describes how individual techniques affect the human body and then shows how to apply these techniques to specific body regions, allowing the therapist to combine techniques for specific sequences. An introduction to other massage traditions, such as sports massage, trigger points and pressure, rolfing, and shiatsu, is new to this edition.Detailed descriptions and a classification of massage techniques inform the reader about each specific massage stroke.Descriptive illustrations demonstrate basic massage techniques.Local and general massage sequences provide an overview of common treatments, which can be modified to meet specific needs. A new section details individual massage strokes, accompanied by all new, step-by-step photographs that show the direction and sequence of each individual stroke. 3 new chapters review other schools of thought, particularly Eastern therapeutic massage techniques. Updated references at the end of each chapter help the user to follow up on specific topics.Spanish version also available, ISBN: 84-8174-341-0",

Could a cat actually defend a sleeping infant from a deadly rattlesnake that is prepared to strike? Could a dolphin really save a person who is drowning at sea? Could a monkey communicate using English?Defying facts as we know them, these stories detail the intelligence, bravery, and skill of animals. They make us take a second look at creatures who have been viewed as being driven largely by instinct, and they begin to reveal the mysteries of animal intelligence.",

        "Description": "Since the beginning of the Christian era, people have used the words and ideas of Jesus to justify all manner of political action. Despite these repeated attempts, few have been able to move past the rhetoric and understand the true nature of Jesus's political views. Now, in The Political Teachings of Jesus, longtime political analyst and commentator Tod Lindberg goes beyond political punditry to address how Jesus's words and teachings\u2014once a radical set of ideas\u2014have come to define our concept of government and our vision for society. With nuanced prose, Lindberg draws a crucial distinction between Christ's religious and political teachings, presenting a detailed discussion of the world transformation that Jesus sought through his words, stories, and sayings. Guiding readers through the social and political dialogue of the Gospels, Lindberg expertly analyzes how Jesus's principles of universal freedom and equality have combined in our social order to become the unacknowledged bedrock of the modern world. In addition, he offers a provocative look at the role that Jesus's words have played in the formation of the modern democratic ideal, demonstrating how the basic principles of both liberal and conservative thought find common roots in the Christian messiah's words.Through close reading of the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus's parables, Lindberg offers a sophisticated portrait of Jesus as a teacher of unique insight and perception, one whose political views have transcended time and become essential to the way everyone lives in our society. In an era when people on both sides of the aisle are prone to using Jesus's beliefs for their own ends, The Political Teachings of Jesus is a refreshingly clear-eyed take on our shared concepts of government and society\u2014and their common roots between the covers of the New Testament.",
