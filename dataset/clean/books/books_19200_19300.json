At work the next day, Katie began investigating a suicide that looked more like murder. Initial evidence pointed elsewhere, but medical examiner Richard Carroll saw a trail leading to Dr. Edgar Highley. He suspected that the famous doctor's work \"curing\" infertile women was more than controversial -- that it was deceitful, depraved, and often deadly. But before Richard could tell Katie his fears, she left the office for the weekend and an appointment for routine surgery...in Dr. Highley's operating room.",

To get some help, he cops a poetry book from his dad\u2019s den \u2014 and before Kevin knows it, he\u2019s writing in verse about stuff like, Will his jock friends give up on him? What\u2019s the deal with girlfriends? Surprisingly enough, after his health improves, he keeps on writing, about the smart-talking Latina girl who thinks poets are cool, and even about his mother, whose death is a still-tender loss. Written in free verse with examples of several poetic forms slipped into the mix, including a sonnet, haiku, pastoral, and even a pantoum, this funny, poignant story by a master of dialogue is an English teacher\u2019s dream \u2014 sure to hook poetry lovers, baseball fanatics, mono recoverers, and everyone in between.",

        "Description": "When Cardinal Hume died in June 1999, many people from very different backgrounds felt that Great Britain had lost a holy and special man. He was a spiritual leader who was not only admired and respected, but also loved. In Cardinal Hume: A Spiritual Companion, we are given the opportunity to journey alongside this man of God. The book offers reflections and meditations for the seasons of the Christian year, beginning with Lent and Easter, then moving through Pentecost and on to Advent and Christmas. We can follow the year through, or dip into the text at any time. In these pages we find words of understanding, encouragement, and hope--words that speak to us whatever our condition, whatever our beliefs.",

He was the disappointing son of Victoria Mathias, the brother of the brilliant, recently dead Ricky Mathias, and a man who could be counted on to solve small problems. But the telephone caller was an airport security officer, and the news he delivered handed Moon a problem as large as Southeast Asia.His mother, who should be in her Florida apartment, is fighting for her life in a Los Angeles hospital - stricken while en route to the Philippines to bring home a grandchild they hadn't known existed. The papers in her purse send Moon into a world totally strange to him. They lure him down the backstreets of Manila, to a rural cockfight, into the odd Filipino prison on Palawan Island, and finally across the South China Sea to where Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge is turning Cambodia into killing fields, and Communist rockets are beginning to fall on the outskirts of Saigon.Those he meets on this quest are as strange to Moon as Asia itself. There is Lum Lee, an elderly Chinese man who wants Moon to finish a job left unfinished by Ricky's death. But is Lee seeking ancestral bones as he claims, or a shipment of opium lost in the chaos of war? There is Mrs. van Winigaarden, a chic and sophisticated folk-art buyer who wants his help to save her missionary brother - if that is really her motive. Only Nguyen, warrior in a lost cause, with kill communists tattooed on his chest, seems easy to understand. But hardest of all for Moon to fathom is the mythical version of himself he finds among his brother's friends.",

        "Title": "The Old Neighborhood: What We Lost in the Great Suburban Migration, 1966-1999",
        "Authors": "By Suarez, Ray",
        "Description": "\"Life in the city, for the millions who lived it, was once something less than the sum of their lifestyle choices: they woke up, they ate, they shoveled coal, loved, hated, prayed, mated, reproduced, died. For most, the home was not a display object but a place to keep the few things they had managed to hold on to from the surpluses produced by their labor. Their material life was made of the things they didn't have to eat, wear, or burn right this minute. A concertina maybe? A family Bible? A hunting rifle?\"  This life in \"the old neighborhood,\" so lyrically captured by Ray Suarez, was once lived by a huge number of Americans. One in seven of us can directly connect our lineage through just one city, Brooklyn. In 1950, except for Los Angeles, the top ten American cities were all in the Northeast or Midwest, and all had populations over 800,000. Since then, especially since the mid-60s, a way of life has simply vanished.  Ray Suarez, veteran interviewer and host of NPR's \"Talk of the Nation\u00ae,\" is a child of Brooklyn who has long been fascinated with the stories behind the largest of our once-great cities. He has talked to longtime residents, recent arrivals, and recent departures; community organizers, priests, cops, and politicians; and scholars who have studied neighborhoods, demographic trends, and social networks. The result is a rich tapestry of voices and history. The Old Neighborhood captures a crucial chapter in the experience of postwar America. It is a book not just for first- and second-generation Americans, but for anyone who remembers the prewar cities or wonders how we could have gotten to where we are. It is a book about \"old neighborhoods\" that were once cherished, and are now lost.",

        "Title": "The Paradox of Change: American Women in the 20th Century",
        "Authors": "By Chafe, William Henry",
        "Description": "When William Chafe's The American Woman was published in 1972, it was hailed as a breakthrough in the study of women in this century. Bella Abzug praised it as \"a remarkable job of historical research,\" and Alice Kessler-Harris called it \"an extraordinarily useful synthesis of material about 20th-century women.\"  But much has happened in the last two decades--both in terms of scholarship, and in the lives of American women.  With The Paradox of Change, Chafe builds on his classic work, taking full account of the events and scholarship of the last fifteen years, as he extends his analysis into the 1990s with the rise of feminism and the New Right.       Chafe conveys all the subtleties of women's paradoxical position in the United States today, showing how women have gradually entered more fully into economic and political life, but without attaining complete social equality or economic justice.  Despite the gains achieved by feminist activists during the 1970s and 1980s, the tensions continued to abound between public and private roles, and the gap separating ideals of equal opportunity from the reality of economic discrimination widened.  Women may have gained some new rights in the last two decades, but the feminization of poverty has also soared, with women constituting 70% of the adult poor.  Moreover, a resurgence of conservatism, symbolized by the triumph of Phyllis Schlafly's anti-ERA coalition, has cast in doubt even some of the new rights of women, such as reproductive freedom. Chafe captures these complexities and contradictions with a lively combination of representative anecdotes and archival research, all backed up by statistical studies.  As in The American Woman, Chafe once again examines \"woman's place\" throughout the 20th century, but now with a more nuanced and inclusive approach.  There are insightful portraits of the continuities of women's political activism from the Progressive era through the New Deal; of the contradictory gains and losses of the World War II years; and of the various kinds of feminism that emerged out of the tumult of the 1960s.  Not least, there are narratives of all the significant struggles in which women have engaged during these last ninety years--for child care, for abortion rights, and for a chance to have both a family and a career.       The Paradox of Change is a wide-ranging history of 20th-century women, thoroughly researched and incisively argued. Anyone who wants to learn more about how women have shaped, and been shaped by, modern America will have to read this book.",

        "Title": "Original Self: Living with Paradox and Originality",
        "Authors": "By Moore, Thomas and Hanley, Joan (ILT)",
        "Description": "\"I spent many years trying to become conscious, but all that effort led merely to self-consciousness, which in turn generated guilt, anxiety, and ambition. I was told that higher consciousness was a worthy goal and that its opposite, unconsciousness, was the result of laziness and ignorance. Around the age of fifty my ideals and values began to change, so much so that many of them turned upside down and inside out. Now I see great value in laziness, understood as giving up both effort and the attempt to justify my life. I have come to appreciate the teaching I have found in many religions that praises holy ignorance. And I have been discovering how to live with little consciousness\"Emerson once remarked that it is advisable to live without consciousness of the workings of the body, and I wonder if the same recommendation applies to the whole of life. Perhaps in some ways we do have to become conscious, and that may be the proper work of the first half of life. But then all our education and learning experiences may fade, not into oblivion, where they are simply lost, but by a process of absorption into us, so that they become us or we become them.\"from Original SelfIt's easy today to lose the deep, direct, and vivid sense of living with passion and originality. Thomas Moore states in his preface that we are \"chronically trying to be someone other than this original self, persuaded that we are not adequate and should fit some norm of health or correctness, we may find a cool distance may gradually separate us from the deep and eternal person, that God-given personality, and we may forget both who we were and who we might be.\"The fifty meditations in this collection offer fresh interpretations of living with originality rather than conformity, presenting multi-dimensional portraits of the creative self and different angles from which to tap one's primal emotions and possibilities. These pages show what it means to live from the burning essence of the heart, with the creativity that comes from allowing the soul to blossom in its own colors and shapes. Simple and beautiful woodcut drawings accompany each meditation, showing the primal yet complex nature of experience and suggesting with great subtlety the themes of paradox and contrariety that characterize the deep self.With his usual grace and insight, Moore counters the prevailing assumptions of the day and offers strikingly unorthodox views on at is virtuous and healthy, opening up possibilities for a renewal of the way we live socially and in our private lives.",

So what could be more welcome than a restful stint in the Character Exchange Program down in the hidden depths of the Well of Lost Plots?But a vacation remains elusive. In no time, Thursday discovers that the Well of Lost Plots is a veritable linguistic free-for-all where grammasites run rampant, plot devices are hawked on the black market and lousy books (like the one she has taken up residence in) are scrapped for salvage. To top it off, a murderer is stalking Jurisfiction personnel and nobody is safe, least of all Thursday herself.Once again, it's up to the ever-resourceful gal detective to track down the killer, save her pulp novel-slash-temporary abode from being chucked into the Text Sea, and get back to her \"real\" life with her body (and memory, if it's not too much to ask) intact.",

The younger son of a prominent American family, Metcalfe is a handsome young man who is a notable guest at all the best parties, has been romantically linked to the elite's most desirable women, and is in great demand in the upper echelons of Paris society. He is also a minor asset in the U.S.'s secret intelligence forces in Europe, cavalierly playing the Great Game like so many socially connected young men before him. But what has been largely an amusing game becomes deadly serious - the spy network he was a part of is suddenly dismantled in the midst of war-torn Europe without a contact, orders, or a contingency plan.With no one else in place, it falls to Metcalfe to instigate a bold plan that may be the only hope for the quickly dwindling remains of the free world. Using his family's connections and relying on his own devices, he travels to wartime Moscow to find and possibly betray a former lover - a fiery ballerina whose own loyalties are in question - in delicate dance that could destroy all he loves and honors. With his opponents closing in on him and the war itself rapidly approaching an irreversible crisis point, Stephen Metcalfe faces both a difficult task and an impossible decision, where success will have unimaginable consequences far into the future and failure is unthinkable.",

In the sensitive hands of this compelling writer, one woman's life becomes the mirror of two profoundly different societies.",

        "Description": "Animals do have culture, maintains this delightfully illustrated and provocative book, which cites a number of fascinating instances of animal communication and learning. John Bonner traces the origins of culture back to the early biological evolution of animals and provides examples of five categories of behavior leading to nonhuman culture: physical dexterity, relations with other species, auditory communication within a species, geographic locations, and inventions or innovations. Defining culture as the transmission of information by behavioral rather than genetical means, he demonstrates the continuum between the traits we find in animals and those we often consider uniquely human.",

He is physically safe, though taunted by the beckoning finger of Uncle Sam. Haunted by the family motto, \u201cRemember who you are,\u201d Porter wrestles with a flood of conflicting emotions. A year later, the conflicts still unresolved, he is an enlisted man in the U.S. Army. In the face of incomprehensible delays and inefficiency, he wonders how America will ever prevail in the world war. Surgical Technician PFC Porter Osborne finally lands at Omaha Beach and joins the Allied fight against Germany.  The final novel in the trilogy that began with Run with the Horsemen and The Whisper of the River, When All the World Was Young continues the story of young Porter Osborne with the supreme wit and wisdom that readers have come to expect from the inimitable Ferrol Sams.  \u201cWith his mastery of words, his skills as storyteller supreme and his highly believable attention to detail\u2026 Sams remains a master yarn-spinner.\u201d \u2013 Nashville Banner",
