Everyone knows Tom Cruise---or at least what he wants us to know. We know that he overcame a difficult childhood to star in astonishing array of blockbusters: Top Gun, Rain Man, Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, Interview with the Vampire, Jerry Maguire, three Mission: Impossible movies, War of the Worlds, and more. We know he has taken artistic chances, too, and as a result has earned three Academy Award nominations and three Golden Globes, along with the respect of acting legends like Paul Newman and Dustin Hoffman.      After that, the picture becomes a little less clear. We know that Tom is a Scientologist, but not necessarily what that means in his life. We know that, despite persistent rumors about his sexuality, he has been married to Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman, and Katie Holmes. But it was not until the spring of 2005, when he jumped on Oprah\u2019s couch to proclaim his love for Katie and denounced Brooke Shields for turning to the \u201cNazi science\u201d of psychiatry, that we began to realize how much we didn\u2019t know about the charming, hardworking star.      For two years, award-winning biographer Andrew Morton has been tirelessly seeking out everyone from former teachers and girlfriends to Scientology insiders to friends who have watched a once-bullied, \u201cnothing special\u201d outsider transform himself into an icon Forbes has called the most powerful celebrity in the world  Here, with never-seen photos and never-heard revelations, is a riveting, sometimes shocking portrait of the real Tom Cruise---his work, his love life, his marriages, his religion---from a master at uncovering the true story behind the public face of celebrity.",

        "Authors": "By Yanes, Romulo A. (PHT)",
        "Description": "Nowadays, everyone who entertains is looking for outstanding casual fare that will allow them to spend more time with their guests. Dishes must be quick and easy to prepare (or able to be made ahead) and filled with the purest ingredients for optimum flavor. The Best of Gourmet, Featuring the Flavors of Thailand is filled with twenty-eight such menus-most are very relaxed, all are absolutely delicious.For example, after a chilly day on the slopes, you may want to treat your houseguests to A Ski House Dinner. Begin the evening around the fire with champagne and a large platter of ever-so-tender smoked salmon with cilantro cream. Later, roasted veal chops with shallots, tomatoes, and olive jus nestled on pillows of soft polenta make a rich, indulgent entr\u00e9e. And before everyone retires, a heavenly warm chocolate raspberry pudding cake, made the day before and reheated, is served with a glass of cognac. When the summer heats up, why not spend A Weekend at the Shore with friends? You'll have three clever menus in hand that take advantage of the season's abundant fresh produce, include plenty of make-ahead dishes, and satisfy hearty seaside appetites. On Saturday morning you can serve Breakfast on the Beach with buttery-rich baked blueberry-pecan French toast. Lunch Indoors includes a serve-yourself composed salad of classic favorites and a lovely rhubarb rice pudding. Then, after a long day in the sun, Dinner on the Deck promises a seafood meal to remember with curry-marinated mussels, followed by grilled lobster with Southeast Asian dipping sauce. Or perhaps a last-minute Beyond Backyard Basics dinner is closer to what you had in mind? This little gem of a menu features ratatouille with penne-a heavenly jumble of roasted eggplants, onions, yellow squash, and red bell peppers, with plum tomatoes, garlic, thyme, parsley, and basil. For dessert, multicolored grapes perched atop pastry cream in puff pastry shells make a scrumptious and ever-so-pretty choice.So which menu will you try first? You'll find more than eighty pages of exquisite full-color photographs to help you decide. Altogether, this volume holds more than 350 recipes-including the very best recipes that appeared in Gourmet's food columns during 1999. There are hundreds of dishes that can be made in forty-five minutes or less (look for the clock symbol \u00f0); plenty of leaner and lighter selections (look for the feather symbol F); seasonal ideas for everything from apples to zucchini; and an impressive array of tempting sweets and snacks.This year's Cuisines of the World section turns to the intriguing flavors of Thailand with a traditional dinner for eight and a collection of Thai snacks. Dishes such as steamed red snapper with ginger, grilled beef salad, fish cakes, and coconut ice cream demonstrate the sweet, sour, hot, and salty tastes of this fascinating country. Informative primers and exquisite full-color photos add further insight.Twenty-four more brand-new recipes appear in a special section featuring Unusual Pastas and Grains. From fresh rice noodles to Israeli couscous to wheat berries, and much more, these unique pantry items will undoubtedly expand your palette of flavors.Just when you thought you had tasted it all, along comes a cookbook that opens up a world of new possibilities-The Best of Gourmet",

        "Authors": "By Katzen, Mollie and Willett, Walter",
        "Description": "The head of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard and the author of Moosewood Cookbook have teamed up to create a new program that will show you how to shrink your waist and keep pounds off--while still eating everything you love!With so many fad diets telling us to eat only this or none of that, it's no surprise that so many of us believe it's impossible to lose weight while eating a wide variety of delicious foods. But it is possible--and surprisingly simple. Eat, Drink, and Weigh Less presents a medically sound, easy-to-use program that paves the way for lifelong weight loss and good health.This isn't a diet that deprives you of anything. You'll lose weight while eating and drinking the same things you already enjoy, including chocolate and alcohol! The secret is adding delicious food to your diet and making surprisingly simple changes in what you eat throughout the day. These small moves will add up to a big weight loss.The Eat, Drink, and Weigh Less eating plan is flexible, adaptable to your lifestyle, and simple to implement. It even features a powerful new way to chart your progress, called the Body Score: The more you raise your Body Score, the more you will lower your weight!While the concept is simple, the science behind it is not. The plan represents years of research conducted by Walter Willett, M.D., the head of the Harvard School of Public Health's Department of Nutrition, including results from the famous Nurses' Health Study. This study scored each of its more than 84,000 participants on food choices, exercise schedule, and body mass--resulting in a number that accurately determined the nurses' risk of heart disease.Now, for the first time, Dr. Willett has teamed up with bestselling cookbook author Mollie Katzen to adapt this complex study to everyday use. With their Nine Turning Points and more than 100 delicious new recipes, they've created a user-friendly diet plan with fail-safe results. Choose foods according to these nine principles and you'll raise your Body Score--and lower your weight for good!",

After trying unsuccessfully to escape, he had his men row out with the anchor, drop it as far into the sea as they could, and then the ship winched its way forward. The image of the church as a boat and tradition as an anchor is prevalent in Christian art. If we examine the biblical view of an anchor, we find, like Prince Madoc, we are to cast our anchor into the future and pull the church forward.Postmodern pilgrims must strive to keep the past and the future in perpetual conversation so every generation will find a fresh expression of the Gospel that is anchored solidly to \u201cthe faith that was once for all delivered.\u201d",

        "Authors": "By Fields, Doug",
        "Description": "If you long to reach kids and see their lives changed by God, this comprehensive guide shows you how. Purpose Driven Youth Ministry will do for youth ministry what Rick Warren's Gold Medallion award-winning, The Purpose Driven Church is doing for pastoral ministry. It's an indispensable guide to creating and maintaining youth ministry for the long run. It will help you create a solid spiritual team that builds the foundations of the Christian faith into the hearts and lives of young people. Forged around the fundamental purposes of evangelism, discipleship, fellowship, ministry, and worship, Purpose Driven Youth Ministry uses the experiences of Saddleback Church to illustrate what a healthy Youth ministry can be. Nine transferable principles help you - Connect with the power of God for passionate, committed leadership - Define the purpose of your ministry and communicate it effectively - Identify your potential audience - Create programs that reach your audience and fulfill God's purposes - Implement processes that move students to maturity - Enhance your ministry with clearly defined values - Team up with parents to involve the whole family - Find volunteers and develop them into participating leaders - Persevere through tough times and thrive in an ever-changing environment. Balancing both theory and practice, Purpose Driven Youth Ministry can be applied to any church setting, regardless of size, denomination, facilities, resources, and existing leadership. Purpose-Driven Youth Ministry will help you develop a ministry that equips students rather than a ministry that coordinates events. Doug Fields says, 'My goal for this book is to coach you through a plan to build a healthy youth ministry that isn't dependent on one great youth leader and won't be destroyed when the youth worker leaves the church. It's not a book on how to grow your youth ministry with six easy steps; it's about identifying, establishing, and building health into your church's youth ministry.",

For the man\u2019s fellow Navy SEALs, and for waiting teams of Army Rangers, there was only one rule now: leave no one behind. In this gripping you-are-there account\u2013based on stunning eyewitness testimony and painstaking research\u2013journalist Malcolm MacPherson thrusts us into a drama of rescue, tragedy, and valor in a place that would be known as...ROBERTS RIDGEFor an elite team of SEALs, the mission seemed straightforward enough: take control of a towering 10,240-foot mountain peak called Takur Ghar. Launched as part of Operation Anaconda\u2013a hammer-and-anvil plan to smash Taliban al Qaeda in eastern Afghanistan \u2013the taking of Takur Ghar would offer U.S. forces a key strategic observation post. But the enemy was waiting, hidden in a series of camouflaged trenches and bunkers\u2013and when the Special Forces chopper flared on the peak to land, it was shredded by a hail of machine-gun, small arms, and RPG rounds.  A red-haired SEAL named Neil Roberts was thrown from the aircraft.  And by the time the shattered helicopter crash-landed on the valley floor seven miles away, Roberts\u2019s fellow SEALs were determined to return to the mountain peak and bring him out\u2013no matter what the cost.Drawing on the words of the men who were there\u2013SEALs, Rangers, medics, combat air controllers, and pilots\u2013this harrowing true account, the first book of its kind to chronicle the battle for Takur Ghar, captures in dramatic detail a seventeen-hour pitched battle fought at the highest elevation Americans have ever waged war. At once an hour-by-hour, bullet-by-bullet chronicle of a landmark battle and a sobering look at the capabilities and limitations of America\u2019s high-tech army, Roberts Ridge is the unforgettable story of a few dozen warriors who faced a single fate: to live or die for their comrades in the face of near-impossible odds.",

Each word is illustrated with a full-color drawing, most of which have been created for this book by the popular illustrator Mary O\u2019Keefe Young. More than half the illustrations include a sample sentence that puts the word in a familiar context.A four-page illustrated story at the front of the book shows George learning how to look up words in his dictionary, drawing children in while introducing them to dictionary skills. At the end of the book, seven one- to two-page illustrations present groups of words related by simple themes such as colors, shapes, and numbers.Developed in collaboration with educational consultants, the word list includes not only concrete objects but many more abstract concepts, like discover and enough, than do other picture dictionaries. Such words are essential for vocabulary development, and Curious George\u2019s antics bring them alive, making them easy and fun for children to learn.",

        "Description": "In this comprehensive and entertaining resource, David Macaulay reveals the inner workings of the human body as only he could. In order to present this complicated subject in an accurate and entertaining way, he put in years of research. He sat in on anatomy classes, dissections, and even reached inside the rib cages of two cadavers to compare their spleen sizes. He observed numerous surgeries, including a ten-hour procedure where a diseased pancreas was removed, as well as one where a worn-out old knee was replaced by a brand new one. This hands-on investigation gives Macaulay a unique perspective to lead his readers on a visual journey through the workings of the human body.The seven sections within the book take us from the cells that form our foundation to the individual systems they build. Each beautifully illustrated spread details different aspects of our complex structure, explaining the function of each and offering up-close glimpses, unique cross-sections and perspectives, and even a little humor along the way.This one-of-a-kind book can serve as a reference for children, families, teachers, and anyone who has questions about how his or her body works. When readers see how David Macaulay builds a body and explains the way it works, they will come away with a new appreciation of the amazing world inside them.",

        "Description": "Here is a treasure and a revelation: the passionate and inspiring love letters of World War I poet Rupert Brooke and a feisty young woman, Noel Olivier - edited by Noel's granddaughter - that provide a romantic portrait of Edwardian and Bloomsbury England.Rupert Brooke met Noel Olivier in 1908. She was fifteen and he was twenty. The budding poet was captivated on sight by the shy, intelligent schoolgirl and began to shower her with highly charged and exuberant letters, which continued to flow until Rupert's untimely death during World War I. While very much the modern young Englishwoman, Noel was undoubtedly overwhelmed to be the object of the poet's romantic passion and replied with painstaking honesty and astonishing verve. When he's patronizing, \"I can't think of any delightful books you would understand,\" she's reproving and feisty, \"Perhaps you thought I hadn't heard of Shakespeare, but I have.\"Song of Love presents their rich and illuminating exchange. A literary find of rare value, these fascinating letters cast new light on the Fabian and Bloomsbury milieus, allow a deeper understanding of Rupert Brooke's life and writing, and reveal the true nature of the mysterious young woman who was the first and most enduring love of his life and who went on to become the most prominent pediatrician of her era.Handsomely designed and produced, this collection of never-before-published correspondence has been edited by Pippa Harris, the granddaughter of Noel Olivier. Song of Love provides a precious glimpse into the passions and poetry of turn-of-the-century England - and into the hearts of all young lovers who, through words, can make their love magical.",

This is a book of hope, a guide to aging without fear or anxiety. Using the same inspired structure of alternating voices, Chris and Harry have recast  material specifically for women, who already live longer and take better care of themselves than men. New material covers menopause and post-menopause, as well as cardiac disease, osteoporosis, sexuality, and more. This is the book that can show us how to turn back our biological clocks\u2014how to put off 70% of the normal problems of aging (weakness, sore joints, bad balance) and eliminate 50% of serious illness and injury. The key to the program is found in Harry's Rules: Exercise six days a week. Don't eat crap. Connect and commit to others. There are seven rules all together, based on the latest findings in cell physiology, evolutionary biology, anthropology, and experimental psychology. Dr. Lodge explains how and why they work\u2014and Chris Crowley, who is living proof of their effectiveness (skiing better today, for example, than he did twenty years ago), gives the just-as-essential motivation.Both men and women can become functionally younger every year for the next five to ten years, then continue to live with newfound vitality and pleasure deep into our 80s and beyond.",

A studious, law-abiding, intense youngster from Newark, New Jersey, Marcus Messner, is beginning his sophomore year on the pastoral, conservative campus of Ohio\u2019s Winesburg College. And why is he there and not at the local college in Newark where he originally enrolled? Because his father, the sturdy, hard-working neighborhood butcher, seems to have gone mad -- mad with fear and apprehension of the dangers of adult life, the dangers of the world, the dangers he sees in every corner for his beloved boy.As the long-suffering, desperately harassed mother tells her son, the father\u2019s fear arises from love and pride. Perhaps, but it produces too much anger in Marcus for him to endure living with his parents any longer. He leaves them and, far from Newark, in the midwestern college, has to find his way amid the customs and constrictions of another American world.Indignation, Philip Roth\u2019s twenty-ninth book, is a story of inexperience, foolishness, intellectual resistance, sexual discovery, courage, and error. It is a story told with all the inventive energy and wit Roth has at his command, at once a startling departure from the haunted narratives of old age and experience in his recent books and a powerful addition to his investigations of the impact of American history on the life of the vulnerable individual.",

        "Description": "Stephen E. Ambrose, acclaimed author of Band of Brothers and Undaunted Courage, carries us along in the crowded and dangerous B-24s as their crews fought to destroy the German war machine during World War II.The young men who flew the B-24s over Germany in World War II fought against horrific odds, and, in The Wild Blue, Ambrose recounts their extraordinary heroism, skill, daring, and comradeship with vivid detail and affection. Ambrose describes how the Army Air Forces recruited, trained, and selected the elite few who would undertake the most demanding and dangerous jobs in the war. These are the boys\u2014turned pilots, bombardiers, navigators, and gunners of the B-24s\u2014who suffered over fifty percent casualties. With his remarkable gift for bringing alive the action and tension of combat, Ambrose carries us along in the crowded, uncomfortable, and dangerous B-24s as their crews fought to the death through thick black smoke and deadly flak to reach their targets and destroy the German war machine. Twenty-two-year-old George McGovern, who was to become a United States senator and a presidential candidate, flew thirty-five combat missions (all the Army would allow) and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. We meet him and his mates, his co-pilot killed in action, and crews of other planes. Many went down in flames. As Band of Brothers and Citizen Soldiers portrayed the bravery and ultimate victory of the American soldiers from Normandy on to Germany, The Wild Blue illustrates the enormous contribution that these young men of the Army Air Forces made to the Allied victory.",

Most of us know instinctively that the phrase ?trust me, light this fuse? is a recipe for disaster. Darwin Award winners do not. Most of us have basic sound judgment that eliminates the need for NO SMOKING signs at gas stations. Darwin Award winners do not. No warning label could have prevented evolution from creeping up on the homeowner who filled his house with natural gas to kill termites, the easy rider who decided to steer his motorcycle with his feet, or the winner who tried to weld a hand grenade onto a chain.

        "Description": "On a warm March evening in Cincinnati, detective Sonora Blair says good-bye to her two teenage children, drives to a neat suburban neighborhood, and walks through the door of a \"home invasion\"--a shocking mass murder scene. Thus begins Lynn Hightower's latest novel, a masterpiece of suspense that combines meticulous procedural detail with page-turning storytelling. From its opening scene to its stunning climax, The Debt Collector is at once chilling, thought-provoking, and utterly impossible to put down.\"No survivors,\" Sonora Blair said to herself when she and her partner, Sam, arrived at the crime scene. A typical American family lived here. In the driveway, a car is left behind in a hurry, its door open, its battery nearly dead. Before she followed Sam inside, Sonora knew what was waiting. She just didn't know how bad it would look, how bizarre the evidence would be, and how powerfully a dying woman's last words would echo in her mind: \"The Angel.\"Within hours Sonora had gotten over the shock. She'd gone home, checked on her kids, and washed the blood off her nice white blouse. Before long she'd be setting off to find a killer--or maybe two. That's when the case takes a sudden, strange turn. A retired cop, legendary to those who worked with him, practically hands Sonora the suspects on a plate: their names, histories, even where they can be found. But among her fellow cops Sonora alone believes there is something more to this case. A third man. Or an angel...In The Debt Collector, Lynn Hightower chillingly captures the collision of a horrific crime with the ordinary lives of its victims. But another life is at stake here. The life of a woman who can't mother her children the way she wishes she could, who misses people she once loved, and who even longs quietly for another chance at romance. And while one family has been wiped out by savage killers, the life of this good cop is at risk now. Because as Sonora moves further and further down a trail full of shocking surprises, bitter revelations, and unpaid debts, she now knows one thing for sure: how close she is getting to the edge.",

What would it take to change the lives of poor childrennot one by one, through heroic interventions and occasional miracles, but in big numbers, and in a way that could be replicated nationwide? The question led him to create the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone, a ninety-seven-block laboratory in central Harlem where he is testing new and sometimes controversial ideas about poverty in America. His conclusion: if you want poor kids to be able to compete with their middle-class peers, you need to change everything in their livestheir schools, their neighborhoods, even the child-rearing practices of their parents.Whatever It Takes is a tour de force of reporting, an inspired portrait not only of Geoffrey Canada but also of the parents and children in Harlem who are struggling to better their lives, often against great odds. Carefully researched and deeply affecting, this is a dispatch from inside the most daring and potentially transformative social experiment of our time.",

Now, in The Overachievers, Robbins uses the same captivating style to explore how our high-stakes educational culture has spiraled out of control. During the year of her ten-year reunion, Robbins goes back to her high school, where she follows heart-tuggingly likeable students including \"AP\" Frank, who grapples with horrifying parental pressure to succeed; Audrey, whose panicked perfectionism overshadows her life; Sam, who worries his years of overachieving will be wasted if he doesn't attend a name-brand college; Taylor, whose ambition threatens her popular girl status; and The Stealth Overachiever, a mystery junior who flies under the radar. Robbins tackles teen issues such as intense stress, the student and teacher cheating epidemic, sports rage, parental guilt, the black market for study drugs, and a college admissions process so cutthroat that students are driven to suicide and depression because of a B. With a compelling mix of fast-paced narrative and fascinating investigative journalism, The Overachievers aims both to calm the admissions frenzy and to expose its escalating dangers.",

Materialism, pressure to achieve, perfectionism, and disconnection are combining to create a perfect storm that is devastating children of privilege and their parents alike.In this eye-opening, provocative, and essential book, clinical psychologist Madeline Levine explodes one child-rearing myth after another. With empathy and candor, she identifies toxic cultural influences and well-intentioned, but misguided, parenting practices that are detrimental to a child's healthy self-development. Her thoughtful, practical advice provides solutions that will enable parents to help their emotionally troubled \"star\" child cultivate an authentic sense of self.",

        "Description": "Jayne Ann Krentz has crafted \"romantic suspense of the highest order\" (Amazon.com) in twenty-two New York Times bestsellers, including her recent blockbuster, Flash. Now, she unearths secrets at a New Age resort, where a hard-edged businessman and a beautiful art expert make a tantalizing mind-body connection -- and where a killer threatens their piece of paradise.  Alexa Chambers has a flair for style, an eye for art -- and a reputation in tatters. An expert in Art Deco, she blew the whistle on an employer who was selling fakes to wealthy clients. Her payoff? No job and no prospects. Now she runs a shop in her hometown of Avalon, Arizona -- a hot spot for crystal devotees and sunset gazers. But gutsy, energetic Alexa has no intention of sitting still. She's ready to take risks to rebuild her career...and she secretly consults on an exquisite deco collection being installed at the new Avalon Resorts. Her scheme might just work -- if she can steer clear of the resort's owner, the enigmatic and possibly dangerous J. L. Trask.  Alexa was a scared teenager the last time she saw Trask, the man who accused her stepfather of murder. Insisting his dad's fatal car crash had been no accident, Trask vowed one day he'd come back to Avalon for revenge. Now, twelve years later, their meeting is inevitable. Their attraction is immediate. And their chances of bliss are infinitesimal.  Trask wants to piece together the past with Alexa's help -- and get closer to this dazzling deco diva. Alexa wants to protect her family -- and figure out Trask's real motivations. But when a killer emerges from the shadows, they have no choice but to team up to solve a deadly crime from long ago. As they trade sizzling sparks and snappy repartee loaded with sensual suggestion, their trail leads to a trendy spa called the Dimensions Institute, whose flaky denizens and strange atmosphere suggest there is more hidden there than meets the eye. They don't need a crystal ball to see that their survival -- and relationship -- depends on more than tantric breathing or a heavenly passion. They need a little help from a higher power: a true and trustworthy love.",
