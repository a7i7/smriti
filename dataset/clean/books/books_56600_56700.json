Now, in Mothers: A Celebration, she reaches deep into her soul and personal experience for inspiring insights about the blessings and challenges of motherhood: how this life-changing event transforms us, matures us, and pushes us to live more profoundly, wisely, and mindfully than ever before.\"When you become a mother, you have an unparalleled opportunity to learn to trust your heart,\" she writes. Trusting our hearts means knowing how to nurture ourselves as well as our children: \"How can we find ways to nourish our minds and souls as we concentrate on doing the same for our children?\" she asks. Stoddard explores this empowering link between mother and child, including stirring memories of her own mother; her experiences as a mother and stepmother; and memories of other powerful women who shaped her life. Finding balance within our many responsibilities, learning the lessons of joy and play and learning to let go are central themes.\"Motherhood transforms us, not just once, but over and over again,\" Alexandra Stoddard notes. In this penetrating book, she honors the strength and power a mother holds in the family. Filled with Stoddard's noted wisdom, down-to-earth honesty, and sparkling spirit, Mothers: A Celebration is a book every generation of women can treasure.",

        "Authors": "By Gingrich, Newt, Forstchen, William R., and Hanser, Albert S. (EDT)",
        "Description": "The Civil War is the American Iliad. Lincoln, Stonewall Jackson, Grant, and Lee still stand as heroic ideals, as stirring to our national memory as were the legendary Achilles and Hector to the world of the ancient Greeks. Within the story of our Iliad one battle stands forth above all others: Gettysburg. Millions visit Gettysburg each year to walk the fields and hills where Joshua Chamberlain made his legendary stand and Pickett went down to a defeat which doomed a nation, but in defeat forever became a symbol of the heroic Lost Cause. As the years passed, and the scars healed, the debate, rather than drifting away has intensified. It is the battle which has become the great \"what if,\" of American history and the center of a dreamscape where Confederate banners finally do crown the heights above the town.  The year is 1863, and General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia are poised to attack the North and claim the victory that would end the brutal conflict. But Lee's Gettysburg campaign ended in failure, ultimately deciding the outcome of the war.  Launching his men into a vast sweeping operation, of which the town of Gettysburg is but one small part of the plan, General Lee, acting as he did at Chancellorsville, Second Manassas, and Antietam, displays the audacity of old. He knows he has but one more good chance to gain ultimate victory, for after two years of war the relentless power of an industrialized north is wearing the South down. Lee's lieutenants and the men in the ranks, embued with this renewed spirit of the offensive embark on the Gettysburg Campaign that many dream \"should have been.\" The soldiers in the line, Yank and Reb, knew as well that this would be the great challenge, the decisive moment that would decided whether a nation would die, or be created, and both sides were ready, willing to lay down their lives for their Cause. An action-packed and painstakingly researched masterwork by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen, Gettysburg stands as the first book in a series to tell the story of how history could have unfolded, how a victory for Lee would have changed the destiny of the nation forever. In the great tradition of The Killer Angels and Jeff Shaara's bestselling Civil War trilogy, this is a novel of true heroism and glory in America's most trying hour.",

        "Description": "In 1999, in The Return of Depression Economics, Paul Krugman surveyed the economic crises that had swept across Asia and Latin America, and pointed out that those crises were a warning for all of us: like diseases that have become resistant to antibiotics, the economic maladies that caused the Great Depression were making a comeback. In the years that followed, as Wall Street boomed and financial wheeler-dealers made vast profits, the international crises of the 1990s faded from memory. But now depression economics has come to America: when the great housing bubble of the mid-2000s burst, the U.S. financial system proved as vulnerable as those of developing countries caught up in earlier crises and a replay of the 1930s seems all too possible.In this new, greatly updated edition of The Return of Depression Economics, Krugman shows how the failure of regulation to keep pace with an increasingly out-of-control financial system set the United States, and the world as a whole, up for the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. He also lays out the steps that must be taken to contain the crisis, and turn around a world economy sliding into a deep recession. Brilliantly crafted in Krugman's trademark style--lucid, lively, and supremely informed--this new edition of The Return of Depression Economics will become an instant cornerstone of the debate over how to respond to the crisis.",

His existence is only speculated upon, only whispered about in American corridors of power and CIA strategy meetings. Though he is all but invisible, he is pulling strings -- and pulling them hard. For suddenly, Russia is a far, far more ominous threat than even the most hardened cold warriors ever thought possible.The Russians have their finger on the switch to the European economy and an eye on the American jugular. And, most importantly, they want to be made whole again. Should America interfere with Russia's plans to \"reintegrate\" her rogue states, well then, America will pay in blood.In Ted Bell's latest pulse-pounding and action-packed tour de force, Alex Hawke must face a global nightmare of epic proportions. As this political crisis plays out, Russia gains a new leader. Not just a president, but a new tsar, a signal to the world that the old, imperial Russia is back and plans to have her day. And in America, a mysterious killer, known only as Happy the Baker, brutally murders an innocent family and literally flattens the small Midwestern town they once called home. Just a taste, according to the new tsar, of what will happen if America does not back down. Onto this stage must step Alex Hawke, espionage agent extraordinaire and the only man, both Americans and the Brits agree, who can stop the absolute madness borne and bred inside the modern police state of Vladimir Putin's 'New Russia'.",

In the center of the shrine, there is the skull of a teenage girl. Meanwhile, on a nearby lakeshore, the headless body of a teenage boy is found by a man walking his dog.Nothing is clear -- neither when the deaths occurred, nor where. Was the skull brought to the cellar or was the girl murdered there? Why is the boy's body remarkably well preserved? Led by a preacher turned politician, citizen vigilantes blame devil worshippers and Wiccans. They begin a witch hunt, intent on seeking revenge.Forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan --  \"five-five, feisty, and forty-plus\" -- is called in to investigate, and a complex and gripping tale unfolds in this, Kathy Reichs's eleventh taut, always surprising, scientifically fascinating mystery.With a popular series on Fox -- now in its third season and in full syndication -- Kathy Reichs has established herself as the dominant talent in forensic mystery writing. Devil Bones features Reichs's signature blend of forensic descriptions that \"chill to the bone\" (Entertainment Weekly) and the surprising plot twists that have made her books phenomenal bestsellers in the United States and around the world.",

        "Description": "\"If eyes were made for seeing,\" wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson, \"then Beauty is its own excuse for being.\" We need no other excuse to enjoy American Beauties, a dazzling panorama of women from all walks of life, as American artists and writers have depicted them over the past two centuries. Elegantly designed and produced, the book opens with Benjamin West's Helen Brought to Paris (1776), a purely mythological treatment of beauty, accompanied by Edgar Allan Poe's classic poem \"To Helen.\" From this beginning we follow a gradual development in the artistic and literary images of American women, as mythology and sentimentality give way to modern views, culminating with Douglas Bourgeois's decidedly unsentimental painting Poet in Her Kitchen (1982) and Anne Sexton's sensitive poem \"It Is a Spring Afternoon.\"Editor Charles Sullivan selected nearly 100 works of art for American Beauties entirely from the thousands of paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, and other works at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C. They encompass many different styles, historical periods, concepts of beauty, and attitudes toward women, as do the more than 100 poems and prose selections that accompany them. Some combinations are lighthearted, such as Red Grooms's collage of Gertrude Stein, which we see with her witty poem \"I Am Rose.\" Others are nostalgic, for example, Eastman Johnson's painting The Girl I Left Behind Me, and the song lyrics that inspired it. Still others, like Mary Cassatt's portrait Sara in a Green Bonnet with Celia Thaxter's poem \"The Sandpiper,\" are timelessly pleasing to the eye and to the imagination.But beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all, so each reader of this unique and vivid anthology will discover and savor the images that are personally most relevant and appealing.Biographical notes give the reader background information on all the artists and writers represented in American Beauties.",

        "Title": "Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case",
        "Authors": "By Taylor, Stuart, Jr. and Johnson, K. C.",
        "Description": "What began that night shocked Duke University and Durham, North Carolina.      And it continues to captivate the nation:  the Duke lacrosse team members' alleged rape of an African-American stripper and the unraveling of the case against them.      In this ever-deepening American tragedy, Stuart Taylor Jr. and KC Johnson argue, law enforcement, a campaigning prosecutor, biased journalists, and left-leaning academics repeatedly refused to pursue the truth while scapegoats were made of these young men, recklessly tarnishing their lives.      The story harbors multiple dramas, including the actions of a DA running for office; the inappropriate charges that should have been apparent to academics at Duke many months ago; the local and national media, who were so slow to take account of the publicly available evidence; and the appalling reactions of law enforcement, academia, and many black leaders.      Until Proven Innocent is the only book that covers all five aspects of the case (personal, legal, academic, political, and media) in a comprehensive fashion. Based on interviews with key members of the defense team, many of the unindicted lacrosse players, and Duke officials, it is also the only book to include interviews with all three of the defendants, their families, and their legal teams.            Taylor and Johnson's coverage of the Duke case was the earliest, most honest, and most comprehensive in the country, and here they take the idiocies and dishonesty of right- and left-wingers alike head on, shedding new light on the dangers of rogue prosecutors and police and a cultural tendency toward media-fueled travesties of justice. The context of the Duke case has vast import and contains likable heroes, unfortunate victims, and memorable villains--and in its full telling, it is captivating nonfiction with broad political, racial, and cultural relevance to our times.",
