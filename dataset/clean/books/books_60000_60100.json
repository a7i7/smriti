All are among the subjects included in the vast collection of legends gathered between 1937 and 1942 by the field workers of the Virginia Writers Project of the WPA. For decades following the end of the project, these stories lay untouched in the libraries of the University of Virginia. Now, folklorist Thomas E. Barden brings to light these delightful tales, most of which have never been in print. Virginia Folk Legends presents the first valid published collection of Virginia folk legends and is endorsed by the American Folklore Society.",

Calabria is also a seedbed of  Italian-American culture; in North America, more people of Italian  heritage trace their roots to Calabria than to almost any other region  in Italy.Mark Rotella's Stolen Figs -- named a Best Travel Book of 2003 by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler -- is  a marvelous evocation of Calabria. A grandson of Calabrese immigrants,  Rotella persuades his father to visit the region for the first time in  thirty years; once there, he meets Giuseppe, a postcard photographer who  becomes his guide. As they travel around the region, Giuseppe initiates  Rotella -- and the reader -- into its secrets: how to make a soppressata and 'nduja, and, of course, how to steal a fig without committing a crime. Stolen Figs is a model travelogue -- at  once charming and wise, and full of an earthy and unpretentious sense  of life that now, as ever, characterizes Calabria and its people.",

Tracing the evolving history of that immensely costly experiment in political wishful thinking, the essays included in the first (2002) edition of this book offered, as one Israeli reviewer put it, a ?timely\u201d and ?important\u201d collection of ?jeremiads, forewarnings of the perils to Israel should it ignore, or seek to fudge, the hard reality of its neighbors\u2019 continuing malevolence.\u201d  This new and expanded edition, drawn like the first from the pages of Commentary, takes note of a much larger ?hard reality,\u201d brought home to Americans by the mass-murder attacks of September 11, 2001, and since then to the West as a whole by the unrelenting jihadist campaign against democratic civilization.  While retaining many of the essays from the first edition, this new volume brings the story of the Mideast conflict up past the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in the summer of 2005. It is a story still steeped in blood?but also, thanks in large part to the determination of the Israeli people and the vigorous American response to Islamist terror, one that may at last contain the seeds of a more realistic and therefore more hopeful future.",

        "Description": "\"Parents today try too hard to be superhuman, often sacrificing their own well-being -- and relationships with friends, family, even their spouses -- to meet the ever-increasing demands of their children's lives. Of course, such efforts inevitably fall short, and parents blame themselves. Mommy Guilt encourages parents to let go of unobtainable (and ill-advised) goals in favor of parenting philosophies that concentrate on the whole family. This eye-opening book presents the results of an original, never-before-published nationwide survey of over 1,300 parents -- 96% of whom reported they felt guilty about some aspect of parenting. The most common include yelling, family time, work choices, school, and sports. Mommy Guilt offers straightforward principles for handling these and many other common issues -- as well as for dealing with everyday challenges that frequently add up to feelings of guilt. Through practical, tried-and-true tips, anecdotes, quizzes, and worksheets, Mommy Guilt illustrates how moms can fend off the guilt and focus on what really matters.\"",

        "Authors": "By McLaren, Brian D.",
        "Description": "A confession and manifesto from a senior leader in the emerging church movement---A Generous Orthodoxy calls for a radical, Christ-centered orthodoxy of faith and practice in a missional, generous spirit. Brian McLaren argues for a post-liberal, post-conservative, post-protestant convergence, which will stimulate lively interest and global conversation among thoughtful Christians from all traditions. In a sweeping exploration of belief, author Brian McLaren takes us across the landscape of faith, envisioning an orthodoxy that aims for Jesus, is driven by love, and is defined by missional intent. A Generous Orthodoxy rediscovers the mysterious and compelling ways that Jesus can be embraced across the entire Christian horizon. Rather than establishing what is and is not 'orthodox,' McLaren walks through the many traditions of faith, bringing to the center a way of life that draws us closer to Christ and to each other. Whether you find yourself inside, outside, or somewhere on the fringe of Christianity, A Generous Orthodoxy draws you toward a way of living that looks beyond the 'us/them' paradigm to the blessed and ancient paradox of 'we.'",

        "Description": "Is there evidence from natural science for an intelligent creator of the universe?For a century the reigning scientific view has been that God is not necessary to account for the existence of the world and of life. Evolutionary theory is said to be all that is needed to explain how we got here. In addition, many theistic evolutionists contend that God likely used many of the mechanisms of evolution to achieve his will.In this book J. P. Moreland and a panel of scholars assert that there is actually substantial evidence pointing in a different direction. First, they consider philosophical arguments about whether it is possible for us to know if an intelligent designer had a hand in creation. Then they look directly at four different areas of science:  the origin of life, the origin of major groups of organisms, the origin of human language and the origin and formation of the universe.The team of experts for this work includes a philosopher, a mathematician, a physicist, a linguist, a theologian, a biophysicist, an astronomer, a chemist and a paleontologist.Their data and their conclusions challenge the assumptions of many and offer the foundation for a new paradigm of scientific thinking.",

        "Title": "Left Hand of God, The: Healing America\u2019s Political and Spiritual Crisis",
        "Authors": "By Lerner, Michael",
        "Description": "The unholy alliance of the Political Right and the Religious Right threatens to destroy the America we love. It also threatens to generate a popular aversion to God and religion by identifying religious values with a pro-war, pro-business, pro-rich, anti-science, and anti-environmental stance. Over the past few decades, the Republicans have achieved political dominance by forging a union with the Religious Right. This marriage has provided a sanctimonious veneer for policies that have helped the rich get richer while ignoring the needs of the middle class and the poor, dismantling environmental and civil liberties protections, and seeking global domination. The Right champions the materialism and ruthless selfishness promoted by unrestrained capitalism and then laments the moral crises of family instability and loneliness experienced by people who bring these commercial values into their homes and personal lives. In response, the Religious Right offers insular communities for the faithful and a culture that blames liberals, activist judges, homosexuals, independent women, and all secular people for the moral and spiritual emptiness so many Americans experience.Yet, however distorted both the Right's analysis and its solutions to America's spiritual crisis may be, it wins allegiance by addressing the human hunger for a life with some higher purpose. The Left, by contrast, remains largely tone-deaf to the spiritual needs of the American people. It is the yearning for meaning in life, not just the desire for money or power, that lies at the core of American politics.Addressing the central mystery of contemporary politics -- why so many Americans vote against their own economic interests -- The Left Hand of God provides an invaluable, timely, and blunt critique of the current state of faith in government. Lerner challenges the Left to give up its deeply held fear of religion and to distinguish between a domination-oriented, Right-Hand-of-God tradition and a more compassionate and hope-oriented Left-Hand-of-God worldview. Further, Lerner describes the ways that Democrats have misunderstood and alienated significant parts of their potential constituency. To succeed again, Lerner argues, the Democratic Party must rethink its relationship to God, champion a progressive spiritual vision, reject the old bottom line that promotes the globalization of selfishness, and deal head-on with the very real spiritual crisis that many Americans experience every day.Lerner presents a vision that incorporates and then goes far beyond contemporary liberal and progressive politics. He argues for a new bottom line in our economy, schools, and government. This is a fundamentally fresh approach, one that takes spiritual needs seriously in our economic and political lives. Presenting an eight-point progressive spiritual covenant with America, Lerner provides a blueprint for how the Democratic Party can effectively challenge the Right and position itself to win the White House and Congress. By appealing to religious, secular, and spiritual but not necessarily religious people,The Left Hand of God blazes a trail that could change our world and reclaim America from the Religious Right.",

We, as Christians, tend to think of wisdom as something to be attained -- an ideal to which we aspire.  Charles Stanley contends that genuine wisdom is evidenced in how we live.  The truly wise person is one whose values, perspectives, career goals, and daily decisions are all shaped by the wisdom found in Christ.Choosing to live according to Biblical precepts is a lifestyle foreign to the worldly patterns among which we live.  Inevitably, there will be clashes between the wisdom of  God and that of the world.  Dr. Stanley teaches how to apply God's wisdom as we handle finances, relate to others, care for our physical health, and carry out day-to-day duties.  This significant volume presents a way of living that embodies wisdom from above.",
