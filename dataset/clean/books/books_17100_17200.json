        "Title": "In Defense of American Liberties: A History of the ACLU",
        "Authors": "By Walker, Samuel",
        "Description": "Throughout the 1988 Presidential campaign, George Bush drew cheers from supporters by attacking Michael Dukakis's membership in the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization that he charged was out of the \"mainstream\" of American life.  Indeed, throughout its history, the organization has championed some decidedly unpopular causes, including free speech rights for racist groups and due process for even the most vicious criminals.       But as Samuel Walker argues in his provocative new book--the first comprehensive history of the ACLU--the organization has played a leading role in shaping principles of individual freedom that are now a cornerstone of American law and the way all of us conceive of personal liberty.  It has been involved in most of the Supreme Court's landmark cases expanding individual rights, and today argues more cases before the Court than anyone but the federal government. In fact, as American Liberties makes clear, the organization has played a central role in creating that mythical American \"mainstream\" that its opponents so often invoke.       In fascinating detail, Walker recounts the ACLU's stormy history since its founding in 1920 to fight for free speech.  He explores its involvement in some of the most famous causes in American history, including the Scopes \"Monkey Trial,\" the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the Cold War anti-Communist witch hunts, and the civil rights movement. And he examines its most famous personalities, such as its puritan and autocratic founder Roger Baldwin; Felix Frankfurter, a long-time member who later voted against many ACLU cases while a Supreme Court justice; and Morris Ernst, who won the landmark case involving James Joyce's Ulysses and led the ACLU to take up the cause of free expression for sexually-frank publications.       Walker deals candidly with the ACLU's less praiseworthy episodes--such as the expulsion of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn from the Board during the ACLU's anti-Communist phase, and he dissects the organization's constant struggle within itself to define the proper scope of civil liberties, revealing facts that will surprise even members of the ACLU.       As Walker's engrossing story demonstrates, the history of the ACLU embodies some of the most important changes in American society in the twentieth century.  The principles for which the organization has fought--such as free speech, fair play, equality, and privacy--are now accepted and cherished by Americans from all walks of life.",

        "Authors": "By Beason, Doug",
        "Description": "In science fiction, futuristic soldiers are often shown wielding light emitting weapons-Flash Gordon used a ray gun, Captain Kirk carried a phaser, and Darth Vader brandished a light saber. But, today, the imagined future of science fiction is soon to be a reality. After more than two decades of research, the United States is on the verge of deploying a new generation of weapons that discharge light-wave energy, the same spectrum of energy found in your microwave, or in your TV remote control. They're called \"directed-energy weapons\"-lasers, high-powered microwaves, and particle beams-and they signal a revolution in weaponry, perhaps, more profound than the atomic bomb. The first directed-energy (DE) weapons are being tested right now, and their deployment is planned in the very near future. In The E-Bomb, author J. Douglas Beason, Ph.D. and a leading U.S. expert in directed-energy research, will explain in clear and non technical prose these exotic new weapons and answer the questions that all Americans will ask: What is Directed Energy? How do DE weapons work? What can these DE weapons do? And are these weapons safe to use? As the once-imagined weapons of the future begin to appear on today's battlefields, the timely publication of The E-Bomb will help explain how and why the future is now.",

        "Authors": "By Clancy, Tom, Koltz, Tony, and Stiner, Carl",
        "Description": "In his first two Commanders books, Tom Clancy teamed with armor and infantry General Fred Franks, Jr., and Air Force General Chuck Horner to provide masterful blends of history, biography, you-are-there narrative, insight into the practice of leadership, and plain old-fashioned storytelling. Shadow Warriors is all of that, and more, for in the words of Lieutenant General Bill Yarborough, \"There are itches that only Special Forces can scratch.\"  The training, resourcefulness, and creativity of the SF soldier make him capable of jobs that few other soldiers could handle, in situations where traditional arms and movement don't apply. Carl Stiner was only the second commander of SOCOM, the U.S. Special Operations Command, responsible for the readiness   of all the Special Operations forces of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, including the Green Berets, Navy SEALS, Rangers, Delta Force, Air Force Special Operations, PsyOps, and Civil Affairs.  Together, he and Clancy trace the transformation of the Special Forces from the small core of outsiders of the 1950s through the cauldron of Vietnam and to the rebirth of the SF in the late 1980s and 1990s as the bearer of the largest, most mixed, and most complex set of missions in the U.S. military. From Vietnam and Laos to Panama and El Salvador to Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq, these are stories of raids, counterterrorism, hostage rescues, reconaissance, counterinsurgency and psychological operations ?and also of building settlements, teaching civilians, cleaning up water supplies, and saving lives. It is a front-row seat to a man, an institution, and a way both of war and peace that together make this an instant classic of military history.",

Once thought to be primarily a way of life of the Arabs and a faith alien to the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, it has grown to be one of the most prominent and rapidly-growing religious movements in America.  This ethnography of immigrant Muslims considers five Northeastern communities in detail. Including numerous interviews with members of these communities, this investigation provides a highly personal look at what it means to be a believing, practicing Muslim in America at a time when Islam is under the critical scrutiny of international news.  The authors describe the institutions and leadership of American Islam, Muslim law, and its applications in the American context, examining the kinds of problems that beset Muslims trying to observe the elements of their faith in a potentially difficult environment. Family life and the roles and relationships of men and women are thoroughly detailed as well.",

In his first new novel since An Instance of the Fingerpost became an international bestseller, Iain Pears transports us to Rome, where an impudent thief has stolen a politically sensitive painting on loan from a foreign museum.  Summoned to see the prime minister, Flavia di Stefano, acting head of Italy's Art Theft Squad, is told to retrieve the painting without publicity or payment of ransom. But does the prime minister mean what he says? And why was this particular painting stolen? Faced with a case sure to cause her grief, Flavia turns to her mentor, General Taddeo Bottando, who has a wholly unexpected view of the situation.  Flavia's husband of four weeks, art historian Jonathan Argyll, is busy, meanwhile, with a mission of his own. As a gift to the soon-to-retire Bottando, Jonathan will track down the provenance of a small Renaissance painting, an Immaculate Conception, now hanging on Bottando's wall. Who owned the painting over the years, and how did it come into Bottando's hands?  Flavia's search for an art thief soon becomes a hunt for a killer, while Jonathan's probe uncovers some startling secrets and an unlikely alliance as poignant as it is surprising. Absorbing, witty, ingeniously plotted, The Immaculate Deception is stylish entertainment from a justly celebrated author.",

        "Authors": "By Quirk, William J. and Bridwell, R. Randall",
        "Description": "Do you consider yourself a member of the middle class? Eighty percent of Americans describe themselves in those terms; working-class citizens who are neither rich nor poor. Has the government addressed the needs of the middle class to your satisfaction?William J. Quirk and R. Randall Bridwell argue that the fundamental interests of the middle class have been ignored and undermined since WWII. This provocative book chronicles the events which have defined the post-WWII political and economic period, and shows how the middle class has been compromised in the process. From the New York City fiscal crisis of the 70s, to the rise of the new judicial activism, to the looming economic influence of Japan, the authors show for the first time how these developments are interrelated.The authors provide a novel interpretation of the constitutional meaning of the events leading to the abandonment of the middle class, as well as a new interpretation of the condition of the American Constitution as it is applied today. By analyzing the constitutional source of problems which our political system has had in recent years, the authors provide a new theory as to why the federal system is not working, and they offer novel solutions for the future.",

        "Description": "Thought to have been lost, dispersed, or even melted down during World War II, the marvelous ancient artifacts known as the \"Gold of Troy,\" or \"Priam's Treasure,\" are among the most important antiquities in existence. The two hundred fifty pieces in this fabulous golden trove were unearthed more than a century ago by the German amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann and have been the subject of endless fascination ever since. In this lavish volume, the official catalogue of the \"Gold of Troy\" exhibition at the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, these spectacular objects are reproduced in full color for the first time, and the tale of how they came to light after fifty years in hiding is told in compelling detail.The story begins with Schliemann (1822-1890), a wealthy businessman whose passion was to find the lost world of Homer. Guided by The Iliad to a site in northern Turkey that he \"knew\" was ancient Troy, he excavated goblets, coins, jewelry, and other treasures of inestimable value, won great fame, and gave the most important finds - \"Priam's Treasure\" among them - to the Berlin Museum. There they remained until the last days of World War II, when the collection was placed in three crates and hidden in an anti-aircraft installation near the Berlin Zoo. As the Red Army overran the city, the Soviets were the first to reach this cache of gold, immediately realized its historical importance, and shipped the hoard to Russia.In The Gold of Troy are superb color photographs of all 259 artifacts in the Pushkin exhibition, accompanied by extensive individual commentaries. The objects - now generally thought to date from 2600 to 2450 B.C., a thousand years earlier than the fabled city Schliemann was seeking - are from thirteen separate sites excavated by Schliemann from 1872 to 1890, and include priceless jewelry such as diadems, rings, bracelets, earrings, pendants, and brooches, as well as anthropomorphic figures, vessels, axes, beads, and more.",

        "Description": "Readers across the country have embraced the moving, magical novels of Luanne Rice, among them her acclaimed bestsellers Firefly Beach, Follow the Stars Home, and Cloud Nine. The New York Times Book Review has called Rice's work \"exciting, emotional, terrific,\" and praises her \"rare combination of realism and romance.\" Now from this gifted writer comes a new novel -- the story of two generations of sisters and the indelible bonds among them, set on the timeless New England coastline she has made her own. Dana Underhill's artistic gift has led her all over the world in search of new oceanscapes. Her breathtaking underwater canvases evoke all the beauty and romance of the seas she and her beloved sister, Lily, have sailed since childhood. But when a shattering event takes Lily from her forever, Dana must leave her nomadic artist's life for the salt marshes and tidal creeks of her childhood home at Hubbard's Point, Connecticut, to become a mother to Lily's two young daughters, Quinn and Allie.Twelve-year-old Quinn may be Dana's toughest challenge. With a mass of wiry braids as uncontrollable as she is, Quinn hides her secret diary in a remote cove and clings fiercely to private mementos of her parents. Already an expert sailor herself, Quinn is convinced their deaths at sea were no accident. Dana, too, is troubled by the puzzle of what could have gone so terribly wrong on that clear, moonlit night. Support comes to Dana with the unexpected reappearance of an old friend, marine biologist Sam Trevor, whom readers will remember from Firefly Beach. When Sam was eight years old, Dana taught him to sail and unlocked his dreams of the undersea world. Now he's a tall, laughing-eyed pro, researching dolphins. And he's been in love with Dana for all the years that have passed between them.Dana cannot begin to contemplate opening her heart again, especially now, especially to a man she can only allow herself to see as a young student. But together, she and Sam begin to discover that Hubbard's Point is the center of endless mysteries, and that many of the answers lie in the blue-purple depths that surge through Dana's paintings and into all of their lives, revealing the transcendence of love even in the face of grief and death. Haunting and powerful, Safe Harbor is an unforgettable story of family bonds, love lost and found, and of a painter's unfolding vision of herself, as an artist -- and as a woman.",

When his beloved Ginny succumbed to an unusual cancer, his campaign became even more bitterly personal.

Further stirring the brew is Guy Newberry, a best-selling New York author and journalist determined to write about the unsolved crime and its dark legacy.Soon Newberry's digging is dividing a town between those who want the truth and those who want to forget it.

This conviction built our great nation and made it the star-spangled superpower that it is. But Bradley Trevor Greive (BTG) wants us to know when enough's enough! Funny and perceptive, The Book for People Who Do Too Much reminds us that, in fact, hard work has killed a whole bunch of people. It has also caused premature aging, unsightly baldness, and explosive indigestion and is responsible for a lot of very questionable fashion statements.Too many people drive themselves beyond reasonable limits to do more, have more, and be more. BTG points out that ironically, they actually end up with a lot less. \"It's like climbing mountain after mountain and never taking the time to look at the view,\" he says.With his trademark combination of engaging animal photos, gentle humor, and priceless insights, BTG urges us to have the courage to say No, and to learn to use this liberating two-letter word in a way that is amusing and empowering, but never offensive. Saying no can sound selfish, but by saving time to enjoy our lives and pursue our true passions, we'll ultimately have a lot more of ourselves to share with those who are most special to us.",

But war came to them, and defeat at the hands of the king of Fire. He had coveted this high, feral land, and now it was his. Caradore, and its guardian family, the Palindrakes, had once belonged to the sea. Their flags were adorned with the ocean's brutal, yet fragile, monsters: sea dragons, proud, attenuated, and coral-frail. If the mournful cries of their shattered ghosts echoed from the ocean now, no one heard them.The flags had fallen and were burned. The elements had clashed and fire reigned triumphant. And now, five lifetimes later, the Palindrake heir, Valraven V, has a twin sister, a woman who embodies their inheritance of power in a way that no wife ever could. Valraven is obedient to his oath to serve the Magravandian Emperor in war and peace, and Pharinet is resigned to her duty as a woman to marry. But the tidal power in their blood draws them to each other, into a forbidden passion that could sweep away bonds of fire placed upon the oceanic magic of the sea.",

All Hosea's memories come flooding back with ferocious force when the bodies of two white women are found engulfed in flames in an abandoned car on his property. These are the first signs that someone wants Hosea off his land; it is up to his son Marcus, the only one of the six children of Hosea and his half-Mexican wife who can negotiate with the white world, to help the family hold on to their home and their livelihood.But it is only when Marcus' nephew Mortrice - a young man infatuated with guns and the power that they bring - comes back to Rio Seco from gang-ridden Los Angeles that the real secrets of the bodies found on Thompson land are revealed, as Rio Seco erupts in the same wave of trashing and looting that has engulfed the nearby metropolis.",

        "Title": "Between a Rock and a Hard Place",
        "Authors": "By Ralston, Aron",
        "Description": "THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER AND BASIS FOR THE MAJOR MOTION PICTURE 127 HOURS One of the most extraordinary survival stories ever told\u2014Aron Ralston's searing account of his six days trapped in one of the most remote spots in America, and how one inspired act of bravery brought him home.It started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston, a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman, a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation, and though he met two charming women along the way, by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone, with just the beauty of the natural world all around him. It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck, in a deep and narrow slot canyon, Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly, and terrifyingly, came loose. Before he could get out of the way, the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall. And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food, no jacket for the painfully cold nights, and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed, he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days, Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin, he'd most probably have died of dehydration, if a flash flood didn't drown him before that. What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack, Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country, thinking back over a life filled with adventure, and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part, his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron, the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive, until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself. Between a Rock and a Hard Place -- a brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.",

        "Description": "We've all heard of the Big Bang, and yet few of us truly know what it is.Renowned for making difficult ideas much less difficult than they might first appear, Simon Singh is our perfect guide to explaining why cosmologists believe that the Big Bang is an accurate description of the origin and evolution of the universe.This highly readable and entertaining book tells the story of the many brilliant, often eccentric scientists who fought against the establishment idea of an eternal and unchanging cosmos. From such early Greek cosmologists as Anaximander to recent satellite measurements taken deep in space, Big Bang is a narrative full of anecdotes and personal histories. With characteristic clarity, Simon Singh tells the centuries-long story of mankind's attempt to understand how the universe came to be, a story which itself begins some 14 billion years ago (give or take a billion years). Simon Singh shows us that it is within the capability of all of us -- in his expert hands -- to understand the Big Bang: the fundamental theory in all of science, and a high point -- perhaps the high point -- of human achievement.",

        "Description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton is known to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Yet few beyond her close friends and family have ever heard her account of her extraordinary journey. She writes with candor, humor and passion about her upbringing in suburban, middle-class America in the 1950s and her transformation from Goldwater Girl to student activist to controversial First Lady. Living History is her revealing memoir of life through the White House years. It is also her chronicle of living history with Bill Clinton, a thirty-year adventure in love and politics that survives personal betrayal, relentless partisan investigations and constant public scrutiny.  Hillary Rodham Clinton came of age during a time of tumultuous social and political change in America. Like many women of her generation, she grew up with choices and opportunities unknown to her mother or grandmother. She charted her own course through unexplored terrain -- responding to the changing times and her own internal compass -- and became an emblem for some and a lightning rod for others. Wife, mother, lawyer, advocate and international icon, she has lived through America's great political wars, from Watergate to Whitewater.  The only First Lady to play a major role in shaping domestic legislation, Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled tirelessly around the country to champion health care, expand economic and educational opportunity and promote the needs of children and families, and she crisscrossed the globe on behalf of women's rights, human rights and democracy. She redefined the position of First Lady and helped save the presidency from an unconstitutional, politically motivated impeachment. Intimate, powerful and inspiring, Living History captures the essence of one of the most remarkable women of our time and the challenging process by which she came to define herself and find her own voice -- as a woman and as a formidable figure in American politics.",
