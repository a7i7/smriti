But everything changes when Blaze falls in love with Roger and they start a new rock band called Match. Now they're married, have a hit record, and Match is going out on a year-long driving tour across the country. Q, along with new stepsister Angela, will take a year off from school and travel with the band. For now, home will be a luxury motor coach and homework will be a Web site diary of their travels. Perfect-Q can practice his magic tricks and Angela can read her spy novels. What can go wrong? As Q and Angela settle into their new life and new relationship as siblings, they start to notice that certain coincidences don't seem coincidental. For example, how does a band roadie named Boone find them in the middle of a desert where their coach just happens to break down? Why does a man from their parents' wedding keep showing up in the same cities they stop at? When they reach Philadelphia, Q and Angela realize this tour is definitely not the trip their parents had planned and that the \"City of Brotherly Love\" is full of mysteries and secrets that could threaten their new life together.

Once you and your canine pal have serious training (for obedience, basic good behavior, and so on) under the belt, you can take the edge off by injecting the whole training process with some fun tricks and games.Tricks and games are open to dogs of all sizes, shapes, and ages. Every dog can learn to do something they\u2019ll enjoy. A Poodle, for example, can learn to dance. A retriever needs to fetch. Bichon Frises love their parlor tricks. Huskies want to pull a sled, herders love to herd, and so on. As for you, the dog owner, you  need to be sure your pooch knows who\u2019s in charge. You need to be the trainer, not the trained, before you and your dog can move on to tricks and games.Dog Tricks For Dummies makes trick training fun for you and your dog. You can teach simple tricks, like wagging the tail on command, and more complex ones, like fetching a soda from the refrigerator. This handy guide also shows you how toUse basic commands such as Sit, Stay, Down, and Go.Teach good manners: Potty in one place, settle in one spot, pick up toysIdentify your dog's personality: Eager Beaver, Comedian, Bully, and moreKeep injuries at bay with a health planTeach jumps (and when not to jump)Have fun in the snow: Sledding, skijoring, and tunnelingGo hiking, backpacking, or carting with your dogTrain your dog to run an agility coursePlay Frisbee and flyballParticipate in pet therapy and at kids' partiesSharing your life with a dog shouldn\u2019t be a militaristic venture, selfishly designed around what you want your dog to do. Owning a dog is about joining two different species, two different spirits, in a way that will make the world better for both.",

She daily interviews world leaders\u2014Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John McCain\u2014and discusses the major events of the day with\u00a0 guests like Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Andrea Mitchell, Chris Matthews, Maureen Dowd, and Tom Friedman.But success hasn\u2019t always come easy for Mika. Growing up the only daughter of a former National Security Advisor, she struggled to find an identity in a family of over-achievers. She found her dream job early on and was hailed as the \u201cIt Girl\u201d of CBS, only to be fired just a few short years later. After an unsuccessful stint as a stay-at-home mom, Mika went back to the workplace with encouragement from her 8-year-old daughter. She took a job that seemed a long-shot at best, and against all odds achieved the greatest success of her career. Now, in a time when many women are losing their jobs or struggling to find the perfect balance between work and home, Mika guides women of all ages to a place where they can find peace and fulfillment in their lives.All Things at Once is a motivational book aimed at women, based on Mika\u2019s own personal and professional triumphs and failures\u2014all of which have led her to her current position as one of television\u2019s most outspoken and respected journalists. Blending the personal with the prescriptive, Brzezinski\u2019s book will address the perpetual question of \u201chaving it all\u201d when it comes to work and family; the importance of remaining equally humble in the face of great success and seemingly devastating setbacks; as well as the necessity of knowing and embracing our limitations so that we may transcend them.In the tradition of Gail Sheehy\u2019s classic Passages, this illuminating book shows women how to reach their full potential in all areas of life, and at every stage of their journey. Readers will recognize their friends, their mothers, their daughters, and themselves in this refreshingly honest memoir.",

He\u2019s the most famous man their small town has ever produced: a naval officer and a brilliant astronomer\u2014a genius who, according to the local paper, has changed the universe. Margaret\u2019s mother calls the match \u201ca piece of luck.\u201dMargaret is a good girl who has been raised to marry, yet Andrew confounds her expectations from the moment their train leaves for his naval base in faraway California. Soon she comes to understand that his devotion to science leaves precious little room for anything, or anyone, else. When personal tragedies strike and when national crises envelop the country, Margaret stands by her husband. But as World War II approaches, Andrew\u2019s obsessions take a different, darker turn, and Margaret is forced to reconsider the life she has so carefully constructed.Private Life is a beautiful evocation of a woman\u2019s inner world: of the little girl within the hopeful bride, of the young woman filled with yearning, and of the faithful wife who comes to harbor a dangerous secret. But it is also a heartbreaking portrait of marriage and the mysteries that endure even in lives lived side by side; a wondrously evocative historical panorama; and, above all, a masterly, unforgettable novel from one of our finest storytellers.",

        "Description": "#1 National BestsellerFrom two of our most fiercely moral voices, a passionate call to arms against our era\u2019s most pervasive human rights violation: the oppression of women and girls in the developing world.With Pulitzer Prize winners Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn as our guides, we undertake an odyssey through Africa and Asia to meet the extraordinary women struggling there, among them a Cambodian teenager sold into sex slavery and an Ethiopian woman who suffered devastating injuries in childbirth. Drawing on the breadth of their combined reporting experience, Kristof and WuDunn depict our world with anger, sadness, clarity, and, ultimately, hope.They show how a little help can transform the lives of women and girls abroad. That Cambodian girl eventually escaped from her brothel and, with assistance from an aid group, built a thriving retail business that supports her family. The Ethiopian woman had her injuries repaired and in time became a surgeon. A Zimbabwean mother of five, counseled to return to school, earned her doctorate and became an expert on AIDS.Through these stories, Kristof and WuDunn help us see that the key to economic progress lies in unleashing women\u2019s potential. They make clear how so many people have helped to do just that, and how we can each do our part. Throughout much of the world, the greatest unexploited economic resource is the female half of the population. Countries such as China have prospered precisely because they emancipated women and brought them into the formal economy. Unleashing that process globally is not only the right thing to do; it\u2019s also the best strategy for fighting poverty.Deeply felt, pragmatic, and inspirational, Half the Sky is essential reading for every global citizen.",

Her new novel, The Story Sisters, charts the lives of three sisters\u2013Elv, Claire, and Meg. Each has a fate she must meet alone: one on a country road, one in the streets of Paris, and one in the corridors of her own imagination. Inhabiting their world are a charismatic man who cannot tell the truth, a neighbor who is not who he appears to be, a clumsy boy in Paris who falls in love and stays there, a detective who finds his heart\u2019s desire, and a demon who will not let go.What does a mother do when one of her children goes astray? How does she save one daughter without sacrificing the others? How deep can love go, and how far can it take you? These are the questions this luminous novel asks. At once a coming-of-age tale, a family saga, and a love story of erotic longing, The Story Sisters sifts through the miraculous and the mundane as the girls become women and their choices haunt them, change them and, finally, redeem them.

But the story of her own life was no less dramatic and moving than her most powerful fiction.With her family, she escaped Russia in 1919 and settled in Paris, where she met and married fellow Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 Michel Epstein. In 1929 she published her highly acclaimed and controversial novel David Golder, the first of many successful books that established her stellar reputation. But when France fell to the Nazis, her renown did her little good: without French citizenship, she was forced to seek refuge in a small Burgundy village with her husband and their two young daughters. And in July 1942 N\u00e9mirovsky was arrested and deported to Auschwitz, where she died the following month.Drawing on N\u00e9mirovsky\u2019s diaries, previously untapped archival material, and interviews, her biographers give us at once an intimate picture of her life and turbulent times and an illuminating examination of the ways in which she used the details of her remarkable life to create \u201csome of the greatest, most humane, and incisive fiction [World War II] has produced\u201d (The New York Times Book Review).",

The story itself centers on The Lake Shore Limited\u2014a play Billy has written about an imagined terrorist bombing of that train as it pulls into Union Station in Chicago, and about a man waiting to hear the fate of his estranged wife, who is traveling on it.

        "Description": "In this astonishing debut, Tracy Winn poignantly chronicles the souls who inhabit the troubled mill town of Lowell, Massachusetts, playing out their struggles and hopes over the course of the twentieth century. Through a stunning variety of voices, Winn paints a deep and permeating portrait of the town and its people: a young millworker who dreams of marrying rich and becoming \u201cMrs. Somebody Somebody\u201d; an undercover union organizer whose privileged past shapes her cause; a Korean War veteran who returns to the wife he never really got to know\u2014and the couple\u2019s overindulged children, who grow up to act out against their parents; a town resident who reflects on a long-lost love and the treasure he keeps close to his heart. Winn\u2019s keen insight into class and human nature, combined with her perfect, nuanced prose, make Mrs. Somebody Somebody truly shine.",

It brings the word of God to life for those who have never read any version of the Bible before and provides fresh insight for those who have read it a thousand times.'--Mike Pilavachi, Soul Survivor'Here is Rob Lacy communicating the truth of God to a world that desperately needs to hear, but finds it so hard to understand.'--Rob Parsons, Care for the Family'Rob Lacey is a man of many languages. He has mastered the language of the stage and is fluent in the language of the street. But most of all, he speaks the language of the heart.'--Gerard Kelly, Cafe.net'The Bible with street creed: Lacey has a refreshingly down-to-earth attitude to the Bible and a wry sense of humour.'--Publishing News'Very different! It makes the Bible as easy to read as a tabloid newspaper. It's great fun if you know the Bible fairly well. But it's also, of course, aimed at people who've never ever opened it. And maybe we do underestimate just how difficult that is if you don't know where to start. I could read it all morning, actually!'--BBC National Radio 2The stories, poetry and music of Scripture come alive as never before in this 75-minute performance based on the award-winning book the word on the street. It's the bible as performance art, inspired by the critically acclaimed live show featuring actor Rob Lacey and musicians Bill and Rachel Taylor-Belaes.'Rob helped me discover angry and sad voices in passages of the Bible that had left me indifferent, and he made me laugh at other passages so familiar that I had never seen the healthy irreverence, humor and irony they expressed.'--Dr. David Trobisch, Professor of New Testament Language and Literature, Bangor Theological SeminaryFor those who've never read the Bible, and for those who've read it too much.Rob Lacey's 'dangerously real' retelling of Scripture vividly demonstrates that the Bible is packed full of stories/poems/images that resonate with the big issues of today. This fresh paraphrase with running commentary brings the text alive: Bible stories are retold as mini-blockbusters; psalms as song lyrics; epistles as emails; Revelation as a virtual reality. Out with stale religious terms, here's a 'Bible' that talks today's language---gritty, earthy, witty. Enough of starting at Genesis with good intentions but getting lost in Leviticus. Lacey succeeds in revitalizing a classic work by focusing on the big picture: fast-forwards through the 'slow-moving' bits with pace, passion and energy to make the Bible a page-turner again.What's more, Lacey's award-winning* tour de force was created during a remarkable personal journey through terminal cancer: the stuff the Bible stories are made of. This life-experience injects Lacey's take on Scripture with authenticity and authority---resonating with Bible characters who also wrestled with the big questions. Purist alert: This is not THE Bible (capital B) ... but it might just get you reaching for one.*Book of the year (2004), Christian Booksellers Convention Ltd. (UK)",

She marries a kind but dull country doctor and discovers that \"This life of hers was as cold as an attic that looks north; and boredom, quiet as the spider, was spinning its web in the shadowy places of her heart.\" Emma Bovary's quest for escape from the emptiness of her bourgeois existence leads to infidelity and financial extravagance, and Gustave Flaubert's powerful and deeply moving examination of her moral degeneration is universally regarded as a landmark of nineteenth-century fiction.Flaubert was brought to trial by the French government on the grounds of this novel's alleged immorality but narrowly escaped conviction. Madame Bovary remains a touchstone for literary discussions of provincial life and adultery as well as a summit of prose art, a pioneering work of realism that forever changed the way novels are written. This complete and unabridged edition features the classic translation by Eleanor Marx-Aveling.",
