        "Description": "It is a very short list of 20th-century American plays that continue to have the same power and impact as when they first appeared \u2014 A Streetcar Named Desire is one of those plays. The story of the fading and desperate Blanche DuBois and how her sensuous and brutal brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski, pushes her over the edge is now classic. Who better than Arthur Miller, America's elder statesman of the theater (Death of a Salesman, The Crucible, A View from the Bridge, Broken Glass, Resurrection Blues), to write as a witness to the lightning that struck American culture when Williams's singular style of poetic dialogue, violence, compassion, and dramatic sexuality was first encountered in the form of A Streetcar Named Desire? Miller's rich perspective and lucid insights make this a unique and essential new edition of A Streetcar Named Desire. Also included are Williams's essay \"The World I Live In\" and a chronology of the author's life and works.",

Many people, all with their own interests and standards, are involved in business encounters every day. \"Stakeholder and Issues Management\" is this text's unique approach to teaching business ethics. It pays special attention to the relationships among the many and varied stakeholders that have roles in business situations. These stakeholders include the market and non-market entities that affect a business. Ethical issues must be addressed by individuals, groups, corporations, and even nations in very different ways, and the consequences differ with each person or group involved. This text gives students practical tools to handle moral dilemmas in the workplace and the world. Topics include risk management, preferential hiring, corporate legitimacy, and moral accountability.",

Although bestsellers such asPoor Richard\u2019s Almanack and The Book of Lists were certainly valuable, they also were largely true. Here is a different kind of handy desk reference, one in which all of the historical oddities and amazing true facts are sifted through the singular, illuminating imagination of John Hodgman\u2014which is the nice way of saying: He made it all up.John Hodgman brings his considerable expertise to bear in answering all of the questions book buyers have been asking:-What are the mottoes of the 51 United States?THE ANSWER IS PROVIDED-Who were the U.S. presidents who had hooks for hands?THE ANSWER IS PROVIDED-What role does the Yale secret society \u201cSkull and Bones\u201d play in the secret world government?THERE IS NO SECRET WORLD GOVERNMENT-What was the menu at the first Thanksgiving, and did it include eels?Technically, that is two questions, but do not apologize, for John Hodgman shall answer them both... LATER.-Aside from a compendium of fake trivia, what is the best kind of book to write?A SIMPLE TABLE OF THE 55 MOST DRAMATIC LITERARY SITUATIONS PROVIDES THE ANSWER, and John Hodgman is the author of that table.Imagine if The Book of Lists had been rewritten by Peter Cook and Jorge Luis Borges under the pseudonym of \u201cJohn Hodgman\u201d and then renamedThe Areas of My Expertise, and you will only begin to have a sense of the dizzying, uproarious, sublimely weird, and strangely wise journey that is contained within this book (along with all the pages and words).Perfect for anyone who thirsts for knowledge, and especially for collectors of books of fake trivia, TheAreas of My Expertise offers through absurdity a better understanding of the world we share\u2014and recognizes that while the truth may be stranger than fiction, it is never as strange as lies...or as true.Watch a QuickTime trailer for this book.",

Darcie escapes with Tristan in a lifepod and touches down on Ganwold, a primitive planet controlled by the Dominion, the long-time enemy of the Unified Worlds. But they have also accidentally jumped more than a year forward in time due to a malfunction in the space drive and cannot expect rescue, so Tristan must grow to young manhood in hiding among the alien ganan.Tristan is barely eighteen when Darcie contracts a lingering, life-threatening illness.

        "Description": "From one of the most beloved and bestselling authors in the English language, a vivid, nostalgic, and utterly hilarious memoir of growing up in the 1950sBill Bryson was born in the middle of the American century\u20141951\u2014in the middle of the United States\u2014Des Moines, Iowa\u2014in the middle of the largest generation in American history\u2014the baby boomers. As one of the best and funniest writers alive, he is perfectly positioned to mine his memories of a totally all-American childhood for 24-carat memoir gold. Like millions of his generational peers, Bill Bryson grew up with a rich fantasy life as a superhero. In his case, he ran around his house and neighborhood with an old football jersey with a thunderbolt on it and a towel about his neck that served as his cape, leaping tall buildings in a single bound and vanquishing awful evildoers (and morons)\u2014in his head\u2014as \"The Thunderbolt Kid.\"  Using this persona as a springboard, Bill Bryson re-creates the life of his family and his native city in the 1950s in all its transcendent normality\u2014a life at once completely familiar to us all and as far away and unreachable as another galaxy. It was, he reminds us, a happy time, when automobiles and televisions and appliances (not to mention nuclear weapons) grew larger and more numerous with each passing year, and DDT, cigarettes, and the fallout from atmospheric testing were considered harmless or even good for you. He brings us into the life of his loving but eccentric family, including affectionate portraits of his father, a gifted sportswriter for the local paper and dedicated practitioner of isometric exercises, and OF his mother, whose job as the home furnishing editor for the same paper left her little time for practicing the domestic arts at home. The many readers of Bill Bryson\u2019s earlier classic, A Walk in the Woods, will greet the reappearance in these pages of the immortal Stephen Katz, seen hijacking literally boxcar loads of beer. He is joined in the Bryson gallery of immortal characters by the demonically clever Willoughby brothers, who apply their scientific skills and can-do attitude to gleefully destructive ends.  Warm and laugh-out-loud funny, and full of his inimitable, pitch-perfect observations, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid is as wondrous a book as Bill Bryson has ever written.  It will enchant anyone who has ever been young.",

        "Title": "The Strongest Tribe: War, Politics, and the Endgame in Iraq",
        "Authors": "By West, Bing",
        "Description": "From a universally respected combat journalist, a gripping history based on five years of front-line reporting about how the war was turned around\u2013and the choice now facing America During the fierce battle for Fallujah, Bing West asked an Iraqi colonel why the archterrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had fled in women\u2019s clothes. The colonel pointed to a Marine patrol walking by and said, \u201cAmericans are the strongest tribe.\u201d In Iraq, America made mistake after mistake. Many gave up on the war. Then the war took a sharp U-turn. Two generals\u2013David Petraeus and Raymond Odierno\u2013displayed the leadership America expected. Bringing the reader from the White House to the fighting in the streets, this remarkable narrative explains the turnaround by U.S. forces. In the course of fourteen extended trips over five years, West embedded with more than sixty front-line units, discussing strategy with generals and tactics with corporals. He provides an expert\u2019s account of counterinsurgency, disposing of myths. By describing the characters and combat in city after city, West gives the reader an in-depth understanding that will inform the debate about the war. This is the definitive study of how American soldiers actually fought \u2013a gripping and visceral book that changes the way we think about the war, and essential reading for understanding the next critical steps to be taken.Praise for The Strongest Tribe:\"Balanced, panoramic assessment of the Iraq War by former Marine and Reagan administration veteran West (No True Glory, 2005, etc.), who heralds American soldiers as its unsung heroes amid the \u201cfog of Washington\u201d. . .A timely, eye-opening historical analysis that provides clarity around the difficult choices the next president faces.\" --Kirkus (starred review)\"In this important new chronicle of the war in Iraq, Bing West reveals how America reached the brink of defeat in 2006 and then managed in 2007 to stage a stunning turnaround. With its vivid, on-the-ground reporting, his book is a fitting tribute to the honor, valor, and toughness of our soldiers. Notwithstanding numerous mistakes by their leaders, West shows that their sacrifices have made success possible--as long we do not withdraw prematurely.\" --Senator John S. McCain\u201cSometimes the best way to support the troops is to criticize the generals.  Bing West does both well in this book, showing a sympathy for our soldiers and Marines, but also a great ear for military truth and a determination to render events accurately.  This is his third and most important book about the Iraq war.  Read it.\u201d-- Thomas E. Ricks, author of FIASCO: The American Military Adventure in Iraq \u201cA brilliant exposition. Based on extensive experience in the war zone, Bing West recounts how Soldiers and Marines showed the President and the Pentagon the way to solve the Iraq insurgency problem. Echoing the admonition that \"all politics are local\", The Strongest Tribe convincingly argues that it was a grass roots strategy developed by on-scene officers who forged ties at the tribal level that brought stability to Iraq's turbulent Anbar Province and provided hope for all Iraq.\u201d -- Lt. Gen. Bernard E. Trainor USMC (Ret.) Co-author of The Generals' War and COBRA II: The Inside Story of the Invation and Occupation of Iraq\u201cSome four decades ago I told Bing West that his book, the Village, would become a classic in counterinsurgency warfare. And so it did. \"The Strongest Tribe\" will surely be West's second classic -\u00a0 a moving and detailed account of almost six years of war in Iraq.\u201d - Dr. James R. Schlesinger, Director of Central Intelligence Agency, Nixon administration; Secretary of Defense, Ford administration; Chairman, The Mitre Corporation",

[a] compellingly cinematic spy thriller with verve.\u201d\u2014Entertainment WeeklyNAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY AND ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW AND THE WASHINGTON POSTEddie Chapman was a charming criminal, a con man, and a philanderer. He was also one of the most remarkable double agents Britain has ever produced. In 1941, after training as German spy in occupied France, Chapman was parachuted into Britain with a revolver, a wireless, and a cyanide pill, with orders from the Abwehr to blow up an airplane factory. Instead, he contacted M15, the British Secret service, and for the next four years, Chapman worked as a double agent, a lone British spy at the heart of the German Secret Service. Inside the traitor was a man of loyalty; inside the villain was a hero. The problem for Chapman, his spymasters, and his lovers was to know where one persona ended and the other began. Based on recently declassified files,\u00a0Agent Zigzag\u00a0tells Chapman\u2019s full story for the first time. It\u2019s a gripping tale of loyalty, love, treachery, espionage, and the thin and shifting line between fidelity and betrayal.",

        "Description": "Gary Berntsen, longtime CIA operative and the field commander who cornered Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, writing with award-winning novelist Ralph Pezzullo, offers in this edge-of-the-seat thriller a terrifying vision of where the next threat to America may come from. When a highly placed Iranian intelligence operative walks into a U.S. embassy claiming to possess explosive information, counterterrorism officer Matt Freed is dispatched to interview him and is warned of an impending attack on the United States that could kill millions. But is the man\u2019s story precious truth or calculated fiction? Matt isn\u2019t sure, but with a possible catastrophe looming in less than two weeks, his superiors reluctantly prepare for the assault. Matt can\u2019t leave it alone, though. With questions still lingering about what is really going on, he defies his superiors\u2019 orders and launches his own investigation. As the clock ticks down, he searches frantically for the truth at an Afghan prison under siege, an abandoned Uzbekistan bio weapons facility, and a Moscow hospital where an arms dealer is dying of a mysterious disease. Ultimately, Matt\u2019s efforts brand him an out-of-control renegade, and he finds himself left out in the cold. Yet he may be the only one with the knowledge needed to avert unimaginable chaos. From a counterterrorism warrior who has spent a lifetime thwarting those who would do us harm, The Walk-In is an exhilarating plunge into tradecraft and terror.",

        "Description": "According to super pollster John Zogby, whom The Washington Post calls \u201cthe maverick predictor,\u201d the conventional wisdom about the United States\u2013that we\u2019re isolated from the world, politically fragmented, and inclined toward material pleasure\u2013isn\u2019t just flawed; it may be 180 degrees from the truth. In this far-reaching and illuminating look at contemporary American life, Zogby reveals nothing less than The Way We\u2019ll Be. Drawing on thousands of in-depth surveys conducted especially for the book, Zogby points out where we\u2019re headed\u2013politically, culturally, and spiritually. The American dream is in transition; it is rapidly being redefined by four meta-movements: living with limits as consumers and citizens; embracing diversity of views and ways of life; looking inward to find spiritual comfort; and demanding authenticity from the media, our leaders, and leading institutions. Spearheaded by today\u2019s eighteen-to-twenty-nine-year-olds\u2013the \u201cFirst Global\u201d generation\u2013Americans are becoming more internationalist, consensus-oriented, and environmentally conscious and less willing to identify themselves by the things they do to earn or spend their money. But this is more than a youth tide. Americans of all ages are moving beyond old divides\u2013red state/blue state, pro-life/pro-choice, beer drinker/wine connoisseur\u2013to form a new national consensus that will shape the nation for decades to come.Zogby\u2019s cogent analysis of the data yields an astonishing perspective on Americans\u2019 thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, now and in coming years. Understanding this emerging reality will be key for\u2022 leaders in all fields who want to reach audiences that are more media-savvy, better informed, and more technologically enabled than ever before\u2022 individuals in search of rewarding and fulfilling careers in tomorrow\u2019s growth fields\u2022 politicians and CEOs looking to marry policies and practices to the rising demand for social responsibility\u2022 anyone who wants to market to the emerging new American consensusBeyond telling a fascinating story, the conclusions in this book are a must-read for everyone from Main Street to Madison Avenue to Capitol Hill. Filled with expert analysis and insight from one of today\u2019s most successful predictors and trend spotters, The Way We\u2019ll Be will redefine how we view America\u2019s future.",

Like his late, beloved father, Lucy is an optimist, though he\u2019s had plenty of reasons not to be\u2014chief among them his mother, still indomitably alive. Yet it was her shrewdness, combined with that Lynch optimism, that had propelled them years ago to the right side of the tracks and created an \u201cempire\u201d of convenience stores about to be passed on to the next generation. Lucy's oldest friend, once a rival for his wife's affection, leads a life in Venice far removed from Thomaston. In fact, the exact nature of their friendship is one of the many mysteries Lucy hopes to untangle in the \u201chistory\u201d he\u2019s writing of his hometown and family. And with his story interspersed with that of Noonan, the native son who\u2019d fled so long ago, the destinies building up around both of them (and Sarah, too) are relentless, constantly surprising, and utterly revealing. Bridge of Sighs, from the beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Empire Falls, is a moving novel about small-town America that expands Russo's widely heralded achievement in ways both familiar and astonishing.",

A successful L.A. comedian, he\u2019s just a regular guy, with his fair share of fears, egocentricities, and addictions. After his father\u2019s death, Mickey meets a mysterious stranger named Francisco, who changes his life forever. The two begin an ongoing discussion about the true nature of being. Reluctantly at first, Mickey accepts the stranger\u2019s help and starts to explore his own life in an effort to answer the riddles Francisco poses.

        "Description": "\u201cA persuasive but painful solution for dealing with the mess in the Middle East.\u201d \u2013Kirkus The greatest danger to America\u2019s peace and prosperity, notes leading Middle East policy analyst Kenneth M. Pollack, lies in the political repression, economic stagnation, and cultural conflict running rampant in Arab and Muslim nations. By inflaming political unrest and empowering terrorists, these forces pose a direct threat to America\u2019s economy and national security. The impulse for America might be to turn its back on the Middle East in frustration over the George W. Bush administration\u2019s mishandling of the Iraq War and other engagements with Arab and Muslim countries. But such a move, Pollack asserts, will only exacerbate problems. He counters with the idea that we must continue to make the Middle East a priority in our policy, but in a humbler, more humane, more realistic, and more cohesive way. Pollack argues that Washington\u2019s greatest sin in its relations with the Middle East has been its persistent unwillingness to make the sustained and patient effort needed to help the people of the Middle East overcome the crippling societal problems facing their governments and societies. As a result, the United States has never had a workable comprehensive policy in the region, just a skein of half-measures intended either to avoid entanglement or to contain the influence of the Soviet Union.Beyond identifying the stagnation of civic life in Arab and Muslim states and the cumulative effect of our misguided policies, Pollack offers a long-term strategy to ameliorate the political, economic, and social problems that underlie the region\u2019s many crises. Through his suggested policies, America can engage directly with the governments of the Middle East and indirectly with its people by means of cultural exchange, commerce, and other \u201csoft\u201d approaches. He carefully examines each of the region\u2019s most contested areas, including Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Lebanon, as well as the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and explains how the United States can address each through mutually reinforcing policies. At a time when the nation will be facing critical decisions about our continued presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, A Path Out of the Desert is guaranteed to stimulate debate about America\u2019s humanitarian, diplomatic, and military involvement in the Middle East.",

        "Description": "From the author of the multimillion-copy, #1 bestselling series The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants comes a heartbreaking first adult novel.  Ann Brashares's series, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, has made her one of the most successful contemporary authors, shipping more than 8 million copies over the last five years and winning even more millions of passionate fans. Now, like Judy Blume (Summer Sisters) before her, Brashares turns her spectacular gifts to adult readers. In The Last Summer (of You and Me), Brashares uses her remarkable storytelling, emotional insights, and talent for capturing relationships to weave a rich, textured, mature novel that will resonate as clearly with readers in their forties as in their twenties.  Set on Long Island's Fire Island, The Last Summer (of You and Me) is an enchanting, heartrending page-turner about sisterhood, friendship, love, loss, and growing up. It is the story of a beach community friendship triangle-Riley and Alice, two sisters in their twenties, and Paul, the young man they've grown up with-and what happens one summer when budding love, sexual curiosity, a sudden serious illness, and a deep secret all collide, launching the friends into an adult world from which their summer haven can no longer protect them.  As wise, compelling, and endearing as her Traveling Pants series, and as lyrical, thoughtful, and moving as the best literary women's fiction, this novel is sure to win an entire new generation of adult fans.",

Readership, advertising, and circulation are plummeting\u2014along with the paper\u2019s vaunted standards\u2014and the cost cutters have their knives out. But trouble of a wholly different kind begins one rainy September morning when a powerful editor is found murdered in the newsroom, with the spike that he\u2019d wielded to kill stories hammered into his chest. The problem for Priscilla Bollingsworth, the young, ambitious female NYPD detective assigned to the case\u2014besides the fact that the mayor is breathing down her neck\u2014is that there are too many suspects to choose from.She teams up with Jude Hurley, a clever, rebellious reporter, and together they navigate the ink-infested waters whose denizens include the paper\u2019s resentful old guard, scheming careerists, a bumbling publisher, a steely executive editor, and a rival newspaper tycoon named Lester Moloch. But the waters thicken considerably when more bodies turn up, dead all over.Armed with the firsthand knowledge he has acquired through forty years in journalism, John Darnton conjures up the cynicism and romanticism of the profession and gives us a cunning, pitch-perfect portrait of the declining\u2014if not yet murderous\u2014newspaper industry. Black and White and Dead All Over is a satirical mystery that entertains from first to last.",

Devil May Care is a masterful continuation of the James Bond legacy\u2013an electrifying new chapter in the life of the most iconic spy of literature and film, written to celebrate the centenary of Ian Fleming\u2019s birth on May 28, 1908.An Algerian drug runner is savagely executed in the desolate outskirts of Paris. This seemingly isolated event leads to the recall of Agent 007 from his sabbatical in Rome and his return to the world of intrigue and danger where he is most at home. The head of MI6, M, assigns him to shadow the mysterious Dr. Julius Gorner, a power-crazed pharmaceutical magnate, whose wealth is exceeded only by his greed. Gorner has lately taken a disquieting interest in opiate derivatives, both legal and illegal, and this urgently bears looking into. Bond finds a willing accomplice in the shape of a glamorous Parisian named Scarlett Papava. He will need her help in a life-and-death struggle with his most dangerous adversary yet, as a chain of events threaten to lead to global catastrophe. A British airliner goes missing over Iraq. The thunder of a coming war echoes in the Middle East. And a tide of lethal narcotics threatens to engulf a Great Britain in the throes of the social upheavals of the late sixties. Picking up where Fleming left off, Sebastian Faulks takes Bond back to the height of the Cold War in a story of almost unbearable pace and tension. Devil May Care not only captures the very essence of Fleming\u2019s original novels but also shows Bond facing dangers with a powerful relevance to our own times.",

The eruption of Italy\u2019s Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 buried a city  and its people, their treasures and secrets. Centuries later, echoes of this disaster  resonate with profound consequences in the life of classics professor Sophie Chase.   In the aftermath of a tragic shooting on the University of Texas campus, Sophie  seeks sanctuary on the isle of Capri, immersing herself in her latest scholarly project  alongside her colleagues, her star pupil, and their benefactor, the compelling yet  enigmatic business mogul John Lyros.  Beneath layers of volcanic ash lies the Villa  della Notte\u2013the Night Villa\u2013home to first-century nobles, as well as to the captivating  slave girl at the heart of an ancient controversy. And secreted in a subterranean  labyrinth rests a cache of antique documents believed lost to the ages: a prize too  tantalizing for Sophie to resist. But suspicion, fear, and danger roam the long-untrodden  tunnels and chambers beneath the once sumptuous estate\u2013especially after Sophie sees  the face of her former lover in the darkness, leaving her to wonder if she is chasing  shadows or succumbing to the siren song of the Night Villa. Whatever shocking events  transpired in the face of Vesuvius\u2019s fury have led to deeper, darker machinations  that inexorably draw Sophie into their vortex, rich in stunning revelations and laden  with unseen menace.

        "Description": "Americans are as safe, well fed, securely sheltered, long-lived, free, and healthy as any human beings who have ever lived on the planet. But we are down on America. So why do we hate us? According to Dick Meyer, the following items on this (much abbreviated) list are some of the contributors to our deep disenchantment with our own culture:Cell-phone talkers broadcasting the intimate details of their lives in public spacesWorship of self-awareness, self-realization, and self-fulfillmentT-shirts that read, \u201cEat Me\u201dFacebook, MySpace, and kids being taught to market themselvesHigh-level cheating in business and sportsReality television and the cosmetic surgery boomMultinational corporations that claim, \u201cWe care about you.\u201dThe decline of organic communitiesA line of cosmetics called \u201cS.L.U.T.\u201dThe phony red state\u2013blue state divideThe penetration of OmniMarketing into OmniMedia and the insinuation of both into every facet of our livesYou undoubtedly could add to the list with hardly a moment\u2019s thought. In Why We Hate Us, Meyer absolutely nails America\u2019s early-twenty-first-century mood disorder. He points out the most widespread carriers of the why-we-hate-us germs, including the belligerence of partisan politics that perverts our democracy, the decline of once common manners, the vulgarity of Hollywood entertainment, the superficiality and untrustworthiness of the news media, the cult of celebrity, and the disappearance of authentic neighborhoods and voluntary organizations (the kind that have actual meetings where one can hobnob instead of just clicking in an online contribution).Meyer argues\u2014with biting wit and observations that make you want to shout, \u201cYes! I hate that too!\u201d\u2014that when the social, spiritual, and political turmoil that followed the sixties collided with the technological and media revolution at the turn of the century, something inside us hit overload. American culture no longer reflects our own values. As a result, we are now morally and existentially tired, disoriented, anchorless, and defensive. We hate us and we wonder why.Why We Hate Us reveals why we do and also offers a thoughtful and uplifting prescription for breaking out of our current morass and learning how to hate us less. It is a penetrating but always accessible Culture of Narcissism for a new generation, and it carries forward ideas that resounded with readers in bestsellers such as On Bullshit and Bowling Alone.",

Sexy content on almost every television channel, as well as in books, movies, video games, and even cartoons. Hot young female pop stars wearing provocative clothing and dancing suggestively while singing songs with sexual and sometimes violent lyrics. These products are marketed aggressively to our children; these stars are held up for our young daughters to emulate\u2013and for our sons to see as objects of desire.Popular culture and technology inundate our children with an onslaught of mixed messages at earlier ages than ever before. Corporations capitalize on this disturbing trend, and without the emotional sophistication to understand what they are doing and seeing, kids are getting into increasing trouble emotionally and socially; some may even to engage in precocious sexual behavior. Parents are left shaking their heads, wondering: How did this happen? What can we do?So Sexy So Soon is an invaluable and practical guide for parents who are fed up, confused, and even scared by what their kids\u2013or their kids\u2019 friends\u2013do and say. Diane E. Levin, Ph.D., and Jean Kilbourne, Ed.D., internationally recognized experts in early childhood development and the impact of the media on children and teens, understand that saying no to commercial culture\u2013TV, movies, toys, Internet access, and video games\u2013isn\u2019t a realistic or viable option for most families. Instead, they offer parents essential, age-appropriate strategies to counter the assault. For instance:\u2022 Help your children expand their imaginations by suggesting new ways for them to play with toys\u2013for example, instead of \u201cplaying house\u201d with dolls, they might send their toys on a backyard archeological adventure.\u2022 Counteract the narrow gender stereotypes in today\u2019s media: ask your son to help you cook; get your daughter outside to play ball.\u2022 Share your values and concerns with other adults\u2013relatives, parents of your children\u2019s friends\u2013and agree on how you\u2019ll deal with TV and other media when your children are at one another\u2019s houses.Filled with savvy suggestions, helpful sample dialogues, and poignant true stories from families dealing with these issues, So Sexy So Soon provides parents with the information, skills, and confidence they need to discuss sensitive topics openly and effectively so their kids can just be kids.",

As he recovers in a burn ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned, he awaits the day when he can leave the hospital and commit carefully planned suicide\u2014for he is now a monster in appearance as well as in soul.A beautiful and compelling, but clearly unhinged, sculptress of gargoyles by the name of Marianne Engel appears at the foot of his bed and insists that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly injured mercenary and she was a nun and scribe in the famed monastery of Engelthal who nursed him back to health. As she spins their tale in Scheherazade fashion and relates equally mesmerizing stories of deathless love in Japan, Iceland, Italy, and England, he finds himself drawn back to life\u2014and, finally, in love. He is released into Marianne's care and takes up residence in her huge stone house. But all is not well. For one thing, the pull of his past sins becomes ever more powerful as the morphine he is prescribed becomes ever more addictive. For another, Marianne receives word from God that she has only twenty-seven sculptures left to complete\u2014and her time on earth will be finished.Already an international literary sensation, the Gargoyle is an Inferno for our time. It will have you believing in the impossible.",

Unreasonably so. Irrationally so. I looked over the scene of our wrecked life and I smiled\u2013a crazy smile for sure\u2013and I looked through the dark at the mad beauty of it.\u201d\u2013Jean SilverwoodAn exhilarating true-life adventure of one family\u2019s extraordinary sea voyage of self-discovery and survival, tragedy and triumphSuccessful businessman John Silverwood and his wife, Jean, both experienced sailors, decided the time was right to give their four children a taste of thrilling life on the high seas. And indeed their journey aboard the fifty-five-foot catamaran Emerald Jane would have many extraordinary and profound moments, whether it was the peaceful late-night watches John enjoyed under the stunning celestial sky or the elation shared by the whole family at the sight of blissful pods of dolphin and migrating tortoises. John and Jean had hoped to use the trip as a teaching opportunity, with the Emerald Jane as a floating classroom in which to instruct their children in important lessons\u2013not only about the natural world but about the beauty of human life when stripped down to its essence, far from the trappings of civilization. Yet rather than flourishing amid the new freedoms and responsibilities thrust upon them, the children were sometimes confused, frightened, resentful. The two oldest, fourteen-year-old Ben and twelve-year-old Amelia, missed their friends and the comfortable life left behind in San Diego, while the two youngest, Jack, seven, and Camille, three, picked up on the stressful currents running above and below the surface\u2013for throughout the journey, the Silverwood family found its bonds tested as never before. John and Jean, whose marriage had weathered its share of storms, would wonder again if they had taken on too much as the physical, emotional, and financial strains of caring for the expensive catamaran and their children brought old resentments to the surface. John\u2019s dream trip that began on Long Island Sound ended almost two years later as a nightmare in treacherous waters off a remote atoll in French Polynesia, where, in an explosion of awesome violence, the terrifying brunt of the ocean\u2019s anger fell upon the Emerald Jane.Gradually, in the crucible of the sea, a stronger, more closely knit unit was forged. The Silverwoods became a crew. Then they became a family again. But just as it seemed to them that they had mastered every challenge, their world was shattered in a split-second of unimaginable horror. Now their real challenge began, forcing them to fight for their very lives.",

They are the voices of ordinary men and women who experienced\u2014and helped to win\u2014the most devastating war in history, in which between 50 and 60 million lives were lost.Focusing on the citizens of four towns\u2014 Luverne, Minnesota; Sacramento, California; Waterbury, Connecticut; Mobile, Alabama;\u2014The War follows more than forty people from 1941 to 1945.

All the iconic events are here, from Pearl Harbor to the liberation of the concentration camps\u2014but we also move among prisoners of war and Japanese American internees, defense workers and schoolchildren, and families who struggled simply to stay together while their men were shipped off to Europe, the Pacific, and North Africa.Enriched by maps and hundreds of photographs, including many never published before, this is an intimate, profoundly affecting chronicle of the war that shaped our world.",
