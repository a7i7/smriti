        "Authors": "By Merrell, James (PHT) and Stewart, Martha",
        "Description": "No one epitomizes the pursuit of healthy pleasures more than Martha Stewart. And nowhere is this clearer than at home in her kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0Now, the millions of fans who seek her guidance can prepare the food that gives Martha her remarkable energy and vitality. Martha Stewart's Healthy Quick Cook presents an all-new collection of 52 quick, easy menus--with more than 175 sensibly lightened recipes--for the kind of food we want to eat today. Over the years, almost effortlessly, Martha has changed the way she cooks and eats. With unparalleled style and good sense, she has trimmed the fat and intensified the flavor of her favorite recipes to create meals that are unfailingly delicious, absolutely healthy, and strictly no-nonsense. A wonderfully filling frittata, flavored with sage, \"enlightened\" with egg whites, and paired with herb-infused garlicky stove-top potatoes, is a terrific low-fat, nutrient-rich meal to begin--or end--the day. Simple, yet no less special, sandwiches and incredible salads of brilliantly matched ingredients--seared tuna burgers splashed with soy sauce and swabbed with fiery wasabi mayonnaise, sugar snap peas mixed with whole mint leaves, and delicate shavings of baby golden beets tossed with fresh basil--reflect Martha's genius for casual yet sophisticated cooking. Instead of concentrating on calorie counts, fat grams, and sodium content, Martha teaches how to eat well intuitively: how to make a variety of grains, fruits, and vegetables a delicious part of everyday eating; how to create menus that are supremely satisfying and nutritionally sound; even how to indulge a sweet tooth properly by enjoying small portions of such classic desserts as whisper-thin lemon tarts, ginger cookies, and fruit crisps. And her recipes come from all over the world, making healthy meals as exciting as they are fulfilling.In her chapters of spring, summer, fall, and winter menus, Martha explains how to use simple low-fat cooking techniques to transform the freshest ingredients of each season into fabulous dishes. You'll find quick grills and saut\u00e9s of such light delicacies as butterfish, softshell crabs, woodsy portobello mushrooms, and mangoes. There are high-heat roasts of winter root vegetables, succulent poussin, pomegranate-lacquered rack of venison, red snapper--even juicy plums. She uses flavor-raising steam for Brussels sprouts, baby spinach, and halibut packaged in grape leaves--and there's an easy stove-top smoked salmon, too.This is inspiring food, presented as only Martha Stewart can. This book will change the way you think about healthy cooking--and what you create in your kitchen every day. Martha Stewart presents a collection of brand-new recipes for the healthful foods that energize her every day. These 52 quick, easy menus represent the effortless style and practicality we have come to expect from Martha. The more than 175 sensibly lightened recipes--all exquisitely prepared and photographed--will change the way you think about healthy cooking and what you create in your kitchen every day.Japanese RisottoGrilled Scallops with Spring GreensRoasted Root Vegetable RagoutSeared Beef and Oranges with ArugulaSage Egg-White FrittataMussels and Baby Artichokes BarigouleWine-Poached Chicken with CharmoulaPoached Salmon Trout with Poppy Seed VinaigretteSeared Tuna Burger with Wasabi MayonnaiseFarmstand Salad with Grilled Turkey SausageVegetable Handrolls",

        "Title": "Boston: A Pictorial Souvenir",
        "Authors": "By Highsmith, Carol M. and Landphair, Ted",
        "Description": "Boston, that historical center of colonial charm, splendid parklands, superior universities, and technological development, is an endlessly fascinating place.  It is the cauldron, not just of American freedom, but also, arguably, of modern democracy itself.  The great names of Boston\u2014Revere, Hancock, Adams, Kennedy, Lodge, O'Neill\u2014are American legends. The stops along the Freedom and the Black Freedom trails are cornerstones of Early American life.  Luckily for visitors, this old port city is compact, easily walkable, and eminently photogenic. Gleaming skyscrapers have asserted their place in the skyline, but Boston seems little changed from the days when Henry David Thoreau dropped in on the Old Corner Bookstore.  In this stunning new collection of full-color portraits, renowned photographer Carol M. Highsmith captures the principal historic landmarks from the African Meeting House to John F. Kennedy's birthplace in Brookline; neighborhoods from tony Beacon Hill to the eclectic South End; thriving downtown shops and restaurants; the major universities and celebrated museums; and the \"Emerald Necklace\" of parklands.  A lively, information-packed introduction and captions by award-winning writer Ted Landphair offer the perfect complement to Highsmith's outstanding images.Boston: A Pictorial Souvenir celebrates the enduring elegance of New England's hub city.  It is the perfect souvenir of a memorable visit, and the ideal gift for anyone who savors history, unforgettable architecture, cultural vitality, and high-tech innovation\u2014the diversity that is truly Boston.",

        "Title": "America the Vulnerable: How Our Government Is Failing to Protect Us from Terrorism",
        "Authors": "By Flynn, Stephen",
        "Description": "America is living on borrowed time -- and squandering it.Three years after September 11, we are still dangerously unprepared to prevent or respond to anotherattack on American soil. Faced with this threat, the United States should be operating on a wartime footingat home. But despite the many new security precautionsthat have been proposed, our most serious vulnerabilities remain ominously exposed.In this powerful and urgently needed call to action, Stephen Flynn offers a startling portrait of the radical shortcomings in America's current plan for homeland security. He describes a frightening scenario of what the next major terrorist attack might look like, revealing the tragic loss of life and economic havoc it would leave in its wake, as well as the seismic political consequences it would have in Washington.Despite increased awareness, we still offer our enemies a vast menu of soft targets: water and food supplies; chemical plants; energy grids and pipelines; bridges, tunnels, and ports; and the millions of cargo containers that carry most of the goods we depend upon in our everyday lives. The measures we have cobbled together to protect these vital systems are hardly fit to deter amateur thieves, vandals, and smugglers, letalone determined terrorists. Worse still, small improvements are often oversold as giant steps forward, lowering the guard of the average citizen and building an unwarranted sense of confidence.It does not have to be this way. Flynn carefully outlines a bold yet practical plan for achieving security in a way that is safe and smart, effective and manageable. In a new world of heightened risk and fear, America the Vulnerable delivers a timely, forceful message that cannot be ignored.",

        "Authors": "By Dreyfus, Jack",
        "Description": "Most people live one life. Jack Dreyfus has had two. The first was filled with remarkable accomplishments. But the second life has extraordinary implications for all of mankind. Today, millions of people recognize the majestic Dreyfus lion, but few know the man behind the symbol.As a young man he was a tournament-winning golfer and nationally-ranked bridge player. He was hailed by The Encyclopedia of Bridge as \"the best gin rummy player in the United States.\" He bred outstanding racehorses and received the Turf Writers' \"Best Breeder of the Year\" award on two occasions. Twice he was Chairman of the Board of the New York Racing Association, receiving the Eclipse award for \"The Man Who Did the Most for Racing.\"However, he is probably best known for his accomplishments in the financial arena. When Jack was thirty-three he became Senior Partner of a New York Stock Exchange firm. The advertisements he created won awards of excellence. The mutual fund he started and managed outperformed all other funds by a wide margin.In 1958 Jack Dreyfus' second life began. He confronted what would prove to be the greatest challenge of his life. In the midst of a severe depression, he accomplished something unheard of for a layman. Having thoughts about electrical activity in his body he asked his physician to let him try Dilantin (phenytoin) a medicine usually prescribed for epilepsy, not depression. It brought him back to good health overnight. He sent six other people with similar symptoms to his physician, and they all had prompt recoveries.Realizing he had an obligation to investigate further, Jack did something most unusual. He retired from his two highly successful businesses, established a charitable medical foundation, and has spent the past thirty years obtaining information from all over the world about the many uses of phenytoin. In spite of phenytoin having been reported in medical journals for being useful for over 50 symptoms and disorders, it is being overlooked because of a flaw in our system of bringing medicine to the public.",

He nurses a fourth belief - that the human brain is cleverer than most of its bearers believe it to be...that it might possibly be almost as clever as God's own.Inspector Donaghue's vacation in the South of France is cut short when the notorious Hollywood film director Thelonius Kapp is found dead during the opening weekend of the exclusive spiritual retreat he helped build at the abbey in St. Pierre la Croix. Although the death looks like suicide, Theo's dying words, a quote from Twelfth Night, lead Ulysses to believe that it was actually murder. As he sifts through suspects ranging from Theo Kapp's beautiful wife to a man-hating Olympic medalist to Lady Bonnington Carter, a walking advertisement for her plastic surgeon husband, Mr. Donaghue unravels a puzzle worthy of the most baffling cases of Agatha Christie in Anna Shone's dazzling mystery debut.",

        "Title": "Treason: How a Russian Spy Led an American Journalist to a U.S. Double Agent",
        "Authors": "By Powell, Bill",
        "Description": "A high-level Russian spy secretly working for the CIA is betrayed and arrested in Moscow. In Washington, counterintelligence agents search for a traitor in the upper reaches of the CIA. In the middle of it all is an American reporter whose chance encounter leads to the discovery of a double agent in the very heart of the American intelligence community. Treason is award-winning reporter Bill Powell's dramatic account of how he became involved in one of the highest-profile U.S. mole hunts of recent decades.  Vyacheslav Baranov had just been released from a prison camp in Siberia when he walked into Newsweek bureau chief Bill Powell's office in Moscow in the summer of 1998. A former colonel in the GRU, the Soviet Union's once-feared military intelligence agency, Baranov had also been one of the highest-ranking spies on the CIA's payroll when he was arrested six years earlier. Baranov was convinced he had been betrayed, and the question that obsessed him -- and that would thrust Powell into the spying game -- was, by whom?  Treason begins on the day Baranov walked into Powell's office, unannounced, saying he had a story Powell would find interesting. Powell was skeptical of Baranov's tale of spying for the CIA and being mishandled by the agency, but he was intrigued and agreed to see Baranov again. Over the course of several weeks, then months, as it became clear to him that Baranov was credible, Powell realized that he might have an extraordinary news story. Little did he know that his meetings with Baranov would put him in the middle of a top-secret mole hunt.  The CIA had assumed that Baranov was one of more than a dozen Soviet double agents who had been betrayed by Aldrich Ames, a former counterintelligence officer in the agency's directorate of operations, who himself had been arrested by the FBI for spying for Moscow. Baranov had another theory about who had betrayed him, and through Powell -- his only means of communicating with the U.S. government -- he managed to pass crucial information to the FBI that convinced its mole hunters that he was right.  A story of intrigue and furtive meetings with secret agents in Moscow, New York, Crete, Moldova, and Bangladesh, Treason recounts how Baranov was first recruited to spy for the GRU, and then by the CIA to spy for the United States. It describes the murky and dangerous world of spies and counterspies -- a world in which it is never clear whom you can trust -- as well as the lonely life of a double agent. It is also an eye-opening account of how the United States handles -- and sometimes mishandles -- its double agents. And it is a vivid firsthand account of what can happen when the worlds of journalism and espionage collide.",

A specialist in geriatric medicine, Purcell was a prominent member of the Santa Teresa medical community, and the police had done a thorough job. Purcell had no known enemies and seemed contented with his life. At the time of his disappearance, he was running a nursing care facility where both the staff and the patients loved him. He adored his second wife, Crystal, and doted on their two-year-old son.It wasn't Crystal who called Kinsey. It was Purcell's ex-wife, Fiona. Everything about their meeting made Kinsey uneasy. Fiona's manner was high-handed and her expectations unrealistic. Kinsey's instincts told her to refuse the job, yet she ended up saying, \"I'll do what I can, but I make no promises.\"It was a decision she'd live to regret.Pursuing the mysterious disappearance of Purcell, Kinsey crashes into a wall of speculation. It seems everyone has a theory. The cops think he went on a bender and is too ashamed to come home. Fiona is sure he ran off to get away from Crystal, and Crystal is just as sure he's dead. The staff at the nursing home is convinced he's been kidnapped, and one of his daughters, having consulted a psychic, is certain that he's trapped in a dark place, though she doesn't know where. Kinsey is awash in explanations and sorely lacking in facts. Then pure chance leads her in another direction, and she soon finds herself in a dangerous shadow land, where duplicity and double-dealing are the reality and, with the truth glinting elusively out of reach, she must stake her life on a thin thread of intuition.",

        "Authors": "By Deaver, Michael K.",
        "Description": "Candid, moving and insightful, Nancy is the most personal look at Nancy Davis Reagan ever published.She was the daughter of a single mother. She was a Hollywood movie star. She is the wife of one of the greatest presidents of the twentieth century. She is a cancer survivor. And she now wages her greatest, unwinnable battle -- against her husband's Alzheimer's disease. Nancy Davis Reagan has led an extraordinary life; it has also been an extraordinarily private one. Now Mike Deaver, whose relationship with Mrs. Reagan dates back to the 1960s, shares the side of Nancy that only her intimates know.Most people don't know the real Nancy Reagan, or their impression of her has been shaped by consistently negative press coverage. If you believe the mainstream press, all you would really know about Nancy is that she likes fancy clothes or that she has rich and powerful friends or that she was obsessed with trivialities like the White House's china. Pundits were equally tough on her, crowning her with ugly nicknames, the tamer ones being Queen Nancy, Iron Lady, Ice Lady, and Dragon Lady.But the Nancy Reagan Mike Deaver has come to know over thirty-five years, the woman portrayed in Nancy, is far more complicated than the stereotype. No cardboard cutout, she is pure flesh and blood, a woman of immense will and fortitude. And in the Reagans' fifty-year marriage, Ron always received top billing, and she would have it no other way. She is convinced that her husband was one of the great men of the twentieth century -- a rare world leader who changed the tide of history. Still, Nancy has been no bit player in the story. Deaver believes that Reagan would not have risen to such distinction without Nancy at his side.Reluctantly drawn into politics, the retired actress and housewife was at first intimidated, but then gradually embraced her role. To the president who was incapable of protecting himself from those who served him poorly and even wished him harm, Nancy Reagan would bring discipline. When it would come time for a momentous life decision, to wage a campaign for the White House, she would ask the tough questions. When his image might be tainted, she would fervently guard it, even at the expense of her own.To Ronald Reagan the man, who always had trouble expressing intimacy, Nancy gave the gift of her unrestricted love. She was his respite, his comfort, his reward at the end of the day. Whenever she left him to travel, the leader of the free world was anxious as a schoolboy until she was safely home again. Now to a man no longer capable of looking after himself, Nancy is everything there is left to be: care-taker, guardian, nurturer of the Reagan legacy.",

        "Authors": "By McElheny, Victor K.",
        "Description": "From the discovery of the double helix to the imminent sequencing of the human genome, James Watson has been at dead center in this great biological revolution. Since the very morning after his Nobel Prize-winning discovery, he has continued to ride the scientific supernova that he and his collaborator, Francis Crick, detonated in 1953. Targeting the big questions, mobilizing the best talent, writing the textbook that defined molecular biology, energizing the \"war on cancer,\" he has served as a prime mover of the DNA era. Now, a distinguished science reporter who has known him for decades and worked for him for four years, with unique access to the scientists who know Watson best, has written an unauthorized, non-reverential account of this extraordinaryman. While Watson is probably the most influential scientist in the last half-century, he is also one of the most controversial. From the ruthless competition in the race to identify the structure of DNA, to clashes with ethicists over charged issues in genetics, to a chorus of Bronx cheers for his recent memoir, Watson has left a wake of detractors as well as fans. Until now, Watson has managed to keep control over his legend, fending off aspiring biographers with his own memoirs. Victor McElheny gets behind this invented persona, bringing us close to the relentless genius who triggered and sustained a revolution in science that affects us all.Shares the story of the Nobel Prize-winning scientist, covering his role in the race to identify the structure of DNA, his clashes with ethicists over genetics issues, and his own memoirs.",

Violet, the eldest, grows up believing in the myth of the southern belle-only to discover that good manners and genteel charm aren't going to bring her acceptance from a closed-minded society...or a philandering husband. Lilly is an ex-Black Panther and writer caught up in the stormy aftermath of the sixties; she shuts out this new world of confusion and pain with the heroin that can never give her peace-or salvation. Rose is the youngest, a sculptor who has shaped herself in the image of an independent black woman grounded in the political movements of her time. But she carries a secret heartache that will resonate in the life of her daughter, Imani, who grows up searching for the daddy she longs to know.  Earthy, evocative, rich in the atmosphere and emotional turmoil of the times, Getting Our Breath Back is a story of struggle and forgiveness, of separation and reconciliation...of women who must reinvent themselves if they are to survive, to heal, and to flourish.",

        "Authors": "By Huber, Richard M.",
        "Description": "Parents groan as college tuition rises faster than the rate of inflation. Students wonder where the distinguished professors are hiding as inexperienced graduate students take over the classroom. Business executives, straining to increase employee output, question how faculty productivity is measured. Alumni suspect the trustees of their alma mater are not exacting accountability for administrative performance. The public is concerned that \"political correctness\" is warping the curriculum. Taxpayers ask whether they are getting their money's worth on state-supported campuses.Richard Huber addresses these issues in a book that is both entertaining to read and striking in its insights. Tuition rises faster than the rate of inflation in part because universities enhance their academic reputations by hiring high-salaried scholars with low teaching loads. Undergraduate teaching is often terrible because professors are trained as researchers and rewarded as scholars, not teachers. Faculty output is measured by crude instruments which encourage goofing off as a masquerade for productive work. Trustees fail to enforce accountability because they are typically not familiar with the academic world and are confused by a university culture so totally different from their own corporate culture. The current brawl over the curriculum is not just an ivory tower dispute over race and ethnicity but a challenge to what kind of place America is to be. Taxpayers are not getting their money's worth because research and doctoral-granting universities, the focus of this book, are locked into outmoded personnel practices that assume all tenured professors will be productive scholars.Huber concludes with realistic reforms to improve the teaching of undergraduates and reduce the cost of higher education. And that would be a win-win prescription for the nation as well as the universities.",

She's been with the Bureau for seven years, is good at what she does, and after she pulls off \"the most amazing arrest of the year\" is sure she finally has her ticket to a transfer and promotion.But for a woman to walk into the squad supervisor's office is \"like entering a deep freeze.\" He snags her on a technical detail. Instead of a promotion she gets an official reprimand - and as a test, a high-profile case involving the fading but still-beloved movie star Jayne Mason, a well-known doctor, and an allegedly illegal supply of drugs passing between them. All the elements are right there for Ana to put in the proper order. Simple, straightforward, easy to wrap up...Or so she's given to believe. But it's not long before she discovers that the doctor had employed a distant cousin of hers - a woman Ana never knew, a woman who has recently been brutally murdered. And it doesn't take her much longer to understand that in the eyes of her higher-ups \"Jayne Mason is not a case, Jayne Mason is a...political situation waiting to explode.\" Now, as pressure builds to resolve the case, Ana and her partner, Mike (the \"most married\" man she thought she knew), are drawn closer and closer together, and the boundaries between her private and professional lives begin to blur. And as Ana fights to prevent the case from making its way deep into her psyche, her world, her life - into the long-hidden recesses of her family's mysterious past and into her conflicted present - North of Montana becomes something more: a riveting exploration of power and identity in an explosive culture.North of Montana is an electrifying novel of psychological acuity and unfaltering suspense, the debut of an assured and powerful storyteller - a stunning new voice in fiction.",

As the product of a Scottish mother and an Italian father, he had a home life that was equal parts absurd and loving. Which is plain to see in Jay's heartwarming stories about his parents: like the time his mother knocked him out cold with a pot when he was caught ditching high school. Or the night at Carnegie Hall when she shushed people actually laughing at his show. Or when Jay tried to explain to his dad that crushing the roof on the family car wasn't all that bad.Out on the comedy circuit - a virtual battle zone for Jay - he encountered every humiliation a performer has ever known. From the club owners who didn't pay, to mobsters who spared his life and loaned him their guns, to the agent who wanted him to be America's first comedy wrestler, to the brave and naked strippers who beat up his hecklers for him. Then there were the triumphant performance nights when he was literally mugged onstage, when his clothes were set afire, or when he was merely punched out and taunted with death threats. And also that romantic night at The Comedy Store - working with the likes of David Letterman, Robin Williams, Andy Kaufman, and Steve Martin - when he met his future wife, Mavis, outside the ladies' room!In Hollywood, told that his was a face that would frighten children, Jay went on to explore every facet of movies and television sitcoms, playing thuggish goofballs, before he finally took to the road and ultimately became what he had always wanted to be: host of The Tonight Show.",

        "Title": "Impostors in the Temple: The Decline of the American University",
        "Authors": "By Anderson, Martin",
        "Description": "Impostors in the Temple is a hard-hitting, eye-opening book about the decaying moral and intellectual state of American universities and colleges today--about why things have gone so wrong, and what we can do to set them right.The university is the intellectual engine of America. It is here future leaders are trained, national policy is framed, and standards for our huge educational infrastructure are established. Yet today, despite the staggering costs of a college education, our institutions are not making the grade. The fault lies not with the students, who are brighter than ever, but with the faculties, administrations, and trustees into whose hands we deliver our best young minds.Martin Anderson--domestic policy adviser to two presidents and himself a member of the academic establishment for over three decades--takes American academics to task in this stirring book, sure to be hailed for its scope and clarity. Cutting through political excuses that have gone awry, Anderson addresses the simpler, unuttered truths: how irrelevant the work of our intellectals has become; how corrupt practices are rampant in our universities; how academic elitism has destroyed academic integrity; how too many of our professors are not qualified to teach; how too often it is not professors but students who are relegated to do the teaching; how trustees and administrators are shunning responsibility and looking the other way; and how, by accepting the status quo, Americans are mortgaging their children's educational futures.In clear, vivid prose, Anderson names names, marshals statistics, turns conventional wisdom on its ear, and makes us understand how serious things have become. More important, he offers us dramatic solutions.As provocative as Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind and Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education, Martin Anderson's Impostors in the Temple is sure to raise hackles, spur debate, and fire our imaginations on how to revitalize an American community that processes millions of our young at so steep a cost.",

In Ancestors, his most ambitious work to date, Johanson calls on both extensive, hands-on field-work and current scientific theory to widen the ever-growing window to the human past.Ancestors is the companion volume to a three-part miniseries - hosted by Johanson - of the award-winning PBS science series NOVA. With spectacular photographs and riveting accounts of Dr. Johanson's recent adventures in such exotic landscapes as fossil-rich eastern Africa and the Willandra Lakes region of Australia, the excitement of discovery is contagious. Like a good detective on a lead, Johanson crosses four continents, gathering clues to hominid anatomy, habitat, and placement along the fossil time line in an effort to piece together a compelling picture of human ancestry.Johanson draws from the work of other evolution detectives - archeologists, biologists, geologists, other paleoanthropologists - introducing a cast of eccentric characters and giving a behind-the-scenes look at how scientists work. Johanson also delves into the three most hotly debated topics in the field: why hominids began to walk upright, whether they were \"noble hunters\" or \"cunning scavengers,\" and at what point Homo sapiens evolved.Full of anecdote, drama, innovative theory, and the mystery of human origins, Ancestors is a spell-binding read.",
