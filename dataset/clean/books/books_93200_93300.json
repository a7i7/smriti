        "Description": "A debut novel full of heart, in which love, friendship, and charity teach a young woman to live a bigger life.  When Madeline Stone walks away from Chicago and moves five hundred miles north to the coast of Lake Superior, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, she isn't prepared for how much her life will change. Charged with caring for an aging family friend, Madeline finds herself in the middle of beautiful nowhere with Gladys and Arbutus, two octogenarian sisters-one sharp and stubborn, the other sweeter than sunshine. As Madeline begins to experience the ways of the small, tight-knit town, she is drawn into the lives and dramas of its residents. It's a place where times are tough and debts run deep, but friendship, community, and compassion run deeper. As the story hurtles along-featuring a lost child, a dashed love, a car accident, a wedding, a fire, and a romantic reunion-Gladys, Arbutus, and the rest of the town teach Madeline more about life, love, and goodwill than she's learned in a lifetime. A heartwarming novel, South of Superior explores the deep reward in caring for others, and shows how one who is poor in pocket can be rich in so many other ways, and how little it often takes to make someone happy.",

        "Authors": "By Arnold, Carrie and Walsh, B. Timothy",
        "Description": "More than simple cases of dieting gone awry, eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia are among the most fatal of mental illnesses, responsible for more deaths each year than any other psychiatric disorder. These illnesses afflict millions of young people, especially women, all over the world.       Carrie Arnold developed anorexia as an adolescent and nearly lost her life to the disease. In Next to Nothing, she tells the story of her descent into anorexia, how and why she fell victim to this mysterious illness, and how she was able to seek help and recover after years of therapy and hard work. Now an adult, Arnold uses her own experiences to offer practical advice and guidance to young adults who have recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder, or who are at risk for developing one. Drawing on the expertise of B. Timothy Walsh, M.D., one of America's leading authorities on eating disorders, she reveals in easy-to-understand terms what is known and not known medically about anorexia and bulimia.  The book covers such difficult topics as how to make sense of a diagnosis, the various psychotherapies available to those struggling with an eating disorder, psychiatric hospitalization, and how to talk about these illnesses to family and friends. The result is both a compelling memoir and a practical guide that will help to ease the isolation that an eating disorder can impose, showing young people how to manage and maintain their recovery on a daily basis.       Part of the Adolescent Mental Health Initiative series of books written specifically for teens and young adults, Next to Nothing will also be a valuable resource to the friends and family of those with eating disorders. It offers much-needed hope to young people, helping them to overcome these illnesses and lead productive and healthy lives.",

She explains how to work with each garden to make it fit just right in your unique gardening conditions. Plus, she describes how to make simple and fun garden projects - like building a simple trellis or making a dried flower wreath - that add a new dimension of enjoyment to your gardening.",

Even Bill and Lyndi McCartney, who've long been devoted to the Lord, only recently grasped what they were missing. God wanted them to unite their spiritual pursuits-not just being sold out to God as individuals but Sold Out Two-Gether as husband and wife. Bill and Lyndi have become intentional about their spiritual partnership, and now they're encouraging other married couples to do the same. Do you long for a fresh and powerful relationship with God?Do you want to make sure you're putting your promises into practice in daily life?Do you want to live a legacy as one who is fulfilling God's purposes in your life?Do you want to experience the blessings of a passionate and satisfying marriage? Reaching such godly goals is as close as your closest relationships-with God and your mate. Sold Out Two-Gether is NOT a marriage manual. It's a spiritual growth experience in which husband and wife partner together to accomplish God's purposes. Being Sold Out Two-Gether also brings the body of Christ together. Huge assemblies of men and women have filled sports arenas all over America-men with men, and women with women. Bill and Lyndi have been part of the Promise Keepers movement. Connie Neal has toured the country with Women of Faith, inspiring women all over the country. As these three authors came together to write this book they asked, \"What would happen if every married man and woman came home from such events and united with their mate to accomplish God's purposes?\" Let's find out! Sold Out Two-Gether gets you started. God will take it from there!",

        "Description": "One of the New York Times 10 Best Books of 2009-- now adapted into the feature film Certain Women, starring Kristen Stewart-- award-winning writer Maile Meloy's short stories explore complex lives in an austere landscape with the clear-sightedness that first endeared her to readers. Don't miss her new novel, Do Not Become Alarmed.\u00a0 Meloy's first return to short stories since her critically acclaimed debut,\u00a0Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It\u00a0is an extraordinary new work from one of the most promising writers of the last decade. Eleven unforgettable new stories demonstrate the emotional power and the clean, assured style that have earned Meloy praise from critics and devotion from readers. Propelled by a terrific instinct for storytelling, and concerned with the convolutions of modern love and the importance of place, this collection is about the battlefields-and fields of victory-that exist in seemingly harmless spaces, in kitchens and living rooms and cars. Set mostly in the American West, the stories feature small-town lawyers, ranchers, doctors, parents, and children, and explore the moral quandaries of love, family, and friendship. A ranch hand falls for a recent law school graduate who appears unexpectedly- and reluctantly-in his remote Montana town. A young father opens his door to find his dead grandmother standing on the front step. Two women weigh love and betrayal during an early snow. Throughout the book, Meloy examines the tensions between having and wanting, as her characters try to keep hold of opposing forces in their lives: innocence and experience, risk and stability, fidelity and desire. Knowing, sly, and bittersweet,\u00a0Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It\u00a0confirms Maile Meloy's singular literary talent. Her lean, controlled prose, full of insight and unexpected poignancy, is the perfect complement to her powerfully moving storytelling.",

        "Description": "\u201cThe Long Way Home is Robin Pilcher at his best. I devoured every word of this masterful storyteller.\u201d\u2014Debbie Macomber, #1 New York Times bestselling author In the vein of Maeve Binchy, Rosamunde Pilcher, and Nicholas Sparks, New York Times bestselling author Robin Pilcher returns with his most enchanting novel yet, filled with captivating twists and turns of heart. When Claire Barclay receives news that her beloved stepfather has had a stroke, she\u2019s more than a little shaken. Leo is her last real relative, and his own children rarely check up on the old man. Claire and her husband, Art, leave New York and fly back to Scotland to care for him during the summer. Their visit makes clear that Leo is no longer capable of living on his own, but he is determined to stay in his beloved old house. Art comes up with the idea of turning the place into a conference center, thinking they could purchase the place from Leo and build him a cottage on the property. But the situation is much more complicated than it seems. Claire\u2019s old flame, Jonas Fairwether, has become Leo\u2019s caretaker and trusted confidant. Though Claire distrusts Jonas\u2019s motives, Leo chooses to take his advice to put the house up for public auction rather than sell directly to Art and Claire. Claire is immediately suspicious, and even more so when she finds out that another application has been submitted to develop the property. Does Jonas Fairwether want to knock down the Leo\u2019s house and build a development? It looks like whoever is behind the plan is being driven by financial gain, but there may be an even stronger motive. The Long Way Home will keep readers on the edge of their seats. This is a masterful novel from a master storyteller.",
