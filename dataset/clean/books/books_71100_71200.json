Hackworth, one of America's most decorated soldiers, lays bare his most daring and legendary tour of duty.1966With a full year of Vietnam combat and five months of in-country intense after-action analysis under his pistol belt, Hackworth pens the classic tactical handbook the Vietnam Primer with military historian Samuel Marshall.  In a radical shift from the World War II-era tactics then employed in Vietnam, Hackworth stresses the necessity of using disciplined, small units of well-trained men to best fight the hit-and-run warfare of the elusive Viet Cong.  \"Out G'ing the G,\" he called his tactics.1969Hackworth's expertise lands him back in Vietnam.  The Army's message is clear-put up, or shut up.  Given the \"hopeless,\" morale-drained 4/39th-an infantry battalion of poorly led draftees with one of the Army's worst casualty rates-Hackworth leads from up front and finds the best in every one of his grunts.  Together, they take a page from the VC, write their own book, and become the meanest in the Mekong Delta-the Hardcore Recondos.2002With the U.S. again facing elusive insurgent foes-and the hit-and-run tactics of the international terror networks we're presently up against-the 4/39th Hardcore Battalion's successes provide hard-won lessons-learned that are more applicable now than ever.A tour de force of frontline combat action, Steel My Soldiers' Hearts takes readers alongside sniper missions, into grunt ambush actions, above fields of fire with hard-hitting helicopter strikes, and inside the quagmire of command politics.   Hackworth graduates the Mekong Delta brotherhood into the pantheon of our nation's most heroic warriors.",

In Queen Bee Moms & Kingpin Dads, Rosalind Wiseman gives us the tools to handle difficult situations involving teachers and other parents with grace. Reassuring, funny, and unfailingly honest, Wiseman reveals:\u2022 Why PTA meetings and Back-to-School nights tap into parents\u2019 deepest insecurities\u2022 How to recognize the archetypal moms and dads\u2014from Caveman Dad to Hovercraft Mom\u2022 How and when to step in and step out of your child\u2019s conflicts with other children, parents, teachers, or coaches \u2022 How to interpret the code phrases other parents use to avoid (or provoke) confrontation\u2022 Why too many well-meaning dads sit on the sidelines, and how vital it is that they step up to the plate\u2022 What to do and say when the playing field becomes an arena for people to bully and dominate other kids and adults\u2022 How to have respectful yet honest conversations with other parents about sex and drugs when your values are in conflict\u2022 How the way you handle parties, risky behavior, and academic performance affects your child\u2022 How unspoken assumptions about race, religion, and other hot-button subjects sabotage parents\u2019 ability to work togetherQueen Bee Moms & Kingpin Dads is filled with the kind of true stories that made Wiseman\u2019s New York Times bestselling book Queen Bees & Wannabes impossible to put down. There are tales of hardworking parents with whom any of us can identify, along with tales of outrageously bad parents\u2014the kind we all have to reckon with. For instance, what do you do when parents donate a large sum of money to a school and their child is promptly transferred into the honors program\u2013while your son with better grades doesn\u2019t make the cut? What about the mother who helps her daughter compose poison-pen e-mails to yours? And what do you say to the parent-coach who screams at your child when the team is losing? Wiseman offers practical advice on avoiding the most common parenting \u201cland mines\u201d and useful scripts to help you navigate difficult but necessary conversations.Queen Bee Moms & Kingpin Dads is essential reading for parents today. It offers us the tools to become wiser, more relaxed parents\u2013and the inspiration to speak out, act according to our values, show humility, and set the kind of example that will make a real difference in our children\u2019s lives.Also available as a Random House AudioBook and as an eBook",

In the U.S. alone, there are over 2.4 million weddings every year -- and no two will be exactly alike. Yet whatever the differences, the exchanging of vows is often the most anticipated and memorable moment in the ceremony. Personalizing one's wedding vows is a growing trend in America, but it can be a very stressful experience. This book will help couples by answering some essential questions in preparing for their ceremony: -- How much of your religion's traditional vows should you include?-- Is your favorite poem appropriate for the setting you are in, or should you just memorize a couple of lines?-- Are you stuck on what to say after \"I knew you were the one the moment we met?\"-- Are your favorite Led Zeppelin song lyrics an appropriate expression of how you feel about your fiance?-- Should you share your vows at the rehearsal?",

Then a young female slave, her skin strangely mottled by nature, enters their lives and those of their friends. The fascination of these artists and scientists with the exotic creature in their midst; often cruel, sometimes humane; inevitably alters their relationship with one another and the world around them forever.

        "Description": "The Colonial Williamsburg Tavern CookbookEvery year, millions of people visit Colonial Williamsburg's re-creation of eighteenth-century America for the ambience, the education, and the unparalleled experience of glimpsing our prerevolutionary past. Williamsburg's fascinating form of time travel encompasses not only the architecture and the artisans, but all the details of our rich cultural heritage, including the food. And The Colonial Williamsburg Tavern Cookbook presents that food, our nation's culinary heritage: from stews and slaws and soups to puddings and pies and pot pies--nearly 200 recipes in all. Focusing on Williamsburg's Southern roots and coastal proximity, the dishes owe their inspiration to the distant past, but their preparations have been tailored for contemporary palates--no need to run out and get some suet in which to cook your mutton over the open hearth.Here are perennial standbys such as Brunswick Stew, Standing Rib Roast with Yorkshire Pudding, Virginia Ham with Brandied Peaches, and Cream of Peanut Soup, as well as Spoon Bread, Lemon Chess Pie, and Mulled Apple Cider. There are also unexpected twists on age-old favorites, such as Oyster Po' Boys with Tarragon Mayonnaise, Oven-Braised Gingered Pot Roast, and Carrot Pudding Spiced with Cardamom.Just as the historic town of Colonial Williamsburg is a singular adventure in understanding our nation's history, so too this cookbook is a unique appreciation of our culinary history. In April 1772, George Washington, writing about one of the taverns in Williamsburg, noted, \"Dined at Mrs. Campbells and went to the Play--then to Mrs. Campbells again\" --twice in a single week. The hearty fare that George found so enticing is enjoying a profound renaissance, and The Colonial Williamsburg Tavern Cookbook will enable home cooks to relive the great American culinary tradition--the ultimate in comfort food.",

        "Authors": "By Leleux, Robert",
        "Description": "In the Dear John letter Daddy left for Mother and me, on a Saturday afternoon in early June 1996, on the inlaid Florentine table in the front entry of our house, which we found that night upon returning from a day spent in the cr\u00e8me-colored light of Neiman\u2019s, Daddy wrote that he was leaving us because Mother was crazy, and because she\u2019d driven me crazy in a way that perfectly suited her own insanity.In a memoir studded with delicious lines and unforgettable set pieces, Robert Leleux describes his East Texas boyhood and coming of age under the tutelage of his eccentric, bewigged, flamboyant, and knowing mother.Left high and dry by Daddy and living on their in-laws\u2019 horse ranch in a white-pillared house they can\u2019t afford, Robert and Mother find themselves chronically low on cash. Soon they are forced into more modest quarters, and as a teenaged Robert watches with hilarity and horror, Mother begins a desperate regimen of makeovers, extreme plastic surgeries, and finally hairpiece epoxies---all calculated to secure a new, wealthy husband. Mother\u2019s strategy takes her, with Robert in tow, from the glamorous environs of the Neiman Marcus beauty salon to questionable surgery offices and finally to a storefront clinic on the wrong side of Houston. Meanwhile, Robert begins his own journey away from Mother and through the local theater\u2019s world of miscast hopefuls and thwarted ambitions---and into a romance that surprises absolutely no one but himself. Written with a warmth and a wicked sense of fun that lighten even the most awful circumstances, The Memoirs of a Beautiful Boy is a sparkling debut.",
