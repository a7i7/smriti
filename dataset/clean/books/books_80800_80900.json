        "Title": "Annette Vallon: A Novel of the French Revolution",
        "Authors": "By Tipton, James",
        "Description": "Born into a world of wealth and pleasure, Annette Vallon enjoys the privileges of aristocracy, but a burning curiosity and headstrong independence set her apart from other women of her class. Spoiled by the novels of Rousseau, she refuses to be married unless it is for passion. Her stubborn devotion to her romantic principles bears the sweetest fruit when William Wordsworth, a young English poet, enters her life. She will be his mistress, his muse, his obsession. But theirs is a love that will test Annette in unexpected ways, bringing great joy and gravest peril in a dark time of chaos, upheaval, and death. Set amid the terror and excitement of the French Revolution, Annette Vallon is an enthralling and evocative tale that captures the courageous spirit of a remarkable woman who, for too long, has been relegated to the shadows of history.",

After the monumental convergence of powers at Camp David, the world watched with bated breath as hope for a peaceful resolution to the long, bitter dispute between Israel and Palestine was lost in the wake of the Intifada. Following years of searching for an end to the bloodshed, how did the tragic blindness of both parties throw this region into such chaos?In The Lost Years, Charles Enderlin presents a scrupulous chronicle of the Israeli and Palestinian descent into hell. Political leaders and secret negotiators, military chiefs and CIA agents, Enderlin has met them all\u2013Israelis and Palestinians\u2013and he accounts for all sides, including U.S. and international involvement.

        "Description": "The problem wasn\u2019t just Iraq.It didn\u2019t even start with Iraq.It was bigger than Iraq.\u00a0In fact, it was everything George W. Bush touched, from the very early flop on energy policy to the walking fiasco named Alberto Gonzales. Even adding the tragicomedy of Hurricane Katrina doesn\u2019t come close to describing the governmental catastrophe of the Bush administration. The collapse of the Bush presidency is a broadly acknowledged fact. Everyone who\u2019s anyone, from politicians to comedians, has taken shots at this ever-growing target. By any fair assessment, much of the past seven years has been disastrous. The challenge is to understand why.Few analysts have stepped aside, abandoning easy hits and quick gibes, and analyzed the totality of the Bush Administration.\u00a0 Now, bestselling author Thomas Oliphant does just that.\u00a0 With his keen, experienced eye, he asks the simplest of questions: \u201cHow could some of the smartest, most experienced and politically savvy people in Washington screw up so badly?\u201dAfter all, this was the team led by a man with an MBA.\u00a0 They came to Washington with the mission to run the government in an orderly, businesslike manner.\u00a0 Instead, chaos has ensued.\u00a0 How did this happen?From domestic policy to international goofs, from soaring energy prices to the health care crisis---Thomas Oliphant tackles it all, closely inspecting the initial projections and promises of Bush and his key senior officials, and the ways in which they lost control of these well-publicized and overconfident plans.\u00a0 By comparing their rhetoric to their dismal record, Oliphant provides a historic analysis of the Bush administration---showing how a system so seemingly competent and mechanized could fail so miserably, and with such frequency.In the wake of the Republican loss of Congress \u00a0and unmet promises for future change, and as the presidential campaign to choose Bush\u2019s successor heats up, Oliphant provides a rigorous examination of what went wrong and what this means for the next administration. Utter Incompetents is at its heart a searching look at the George W. Bush administration, its policies, and the legacy that it will leave behind on January 20, 2009. It is also the substantive backdrop for the next president.",

For starters, there\u2019s the biblical plague of seventeen-year cicadas, making a collective noise as loud as a subway train.

He\u2019s promised his parents he will MAKE AN EFFORT, but it\u2019s hard to find friends in a place where everyone\u2019s eager to go out and shoot something. The only consolation is watching his dogs run free on their rural acres\u2014until a freak accident changes everything. And that\u2019s when Chase begins devising The Plan.",

        "Description": "A premier political reporter considers our presidential politics and how to improve them-an essential book as campaign 2000 gets under way.Jules Witcover, who has covered every presidential election since 1952, here combines unparalleled anecdotal knowledge about Presidential politics with scintillating wisdom about just what's wrong with those politics. He shows us, in memorable and dramatic detail, how over the years an influx of professional mercenaries-with no party loyalties and virtually no political principles-has corrupted American public life and formed a new technocracy that dominates every phase of electoral politics. Along with this, television has changed politics dramatically, even destructively, which only discourages voter participation and puts off some of our most promising candidates.In this lively, story-filled book, Witcover examines the many ways in which politicians have condoned or encouraged these developments, and how they have responded to the new demands of a media-driven, money-conscious age. He assesses the effect of campaign funds both \"soft\" and \"hard,\" and of a press corps that practices invasive, \"gotcha\" journalism in its own quest for greater celebrity and financial reward. He concludes with sage and experienced recommendations on how to improve our Presidential politics-beginning even this year!-and revive public interest and confidence in American democracy.",

        "Description": "Gray mist and darkness settle over the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. Underneath a midnight veil of fog and falling moonlight, the town of Doe Springs restlessly sleeps, fearful that the killer, which has already taken four lives, is hunting again. No one would ever suspect that the beautiful dog trainer Ivy Cole stalks on four legs with blazing orange eyes. . . . Ivy Cole has come home to the South, and her first order of business upon arriving in her new town is to eliminate the unsavory folks who reside there. Proud of what she can accomplish under the spell of the full moon, Ivy leaves the consequences of her actions lying about Doe Springs (in pieces) as a reminder that evil happens to those who deserve it.     But something else has taken up residence in the land, something violent and cruel, with an unconscionable appetite that eventually targets the ones Ivy loves. While she hunts and is hunted by the other, Sheriff Hubbard doggedly works to solve the mystery behind the savage killings and mutilations.     Ivy Cole and the Moon is an artful mix of horror, mystery, and Southern literary fiction. Farago weaves ancient werewolf and wolf mythology throughout her plot while blending in scientific and historical facts about true wolves. Forget the stereotypical Hollywood monster. Farago reinvents the werewolf in this first of the Lykanthrop series.      Absent for more than a century, the voice of the wolf rises over the Appalachian peaks once more.",

Gaiter and John Brecher, authors of The Wall Street Journal's popular \"Tastings\" column, have now completely updated and expanded their uniquely user-friendly guide to finding and savoring the world's best wine. As in the first edition, Dottie and John-as they are known to their fans-offer practical, knowledgeable tips to guide you through the bewildering rows of bottles found in wine stores and groceries. They help expand your wine interests to include more than the familiar Chardonnay or Merlot you've been drinking for years by starting with a simple exercise: buy two similar wines, put them in paper bags, and taste them. When you have decided which wine you prefer, you've taken the first step.The thorough revision of the original book not only includes updated assessments of wines from the previous edition but also adds ratings for dozens of new selections, covering ros\u00e9 Champagnes, for example, and extending the Sauvignon Blanc section to cover wines from New Zealand. Drawing on questions from readers and fans, they have expanded the practical advice that helps make them so widely read: new chapters include tips on how to impress the boss, what to do about wine headaches, and how to accept the Blue Nun in your past; and new passages address everything from cork etiquette to great kosher wines. As always, the book features recommendations for excellent wines in all price ranges, from familiar Cabernets and Zinfandels to less well-known but easily accessible Gew\u00fcrztraminers and Barolos. The authors give helpful tips on finding and choosing a wine store, hosting your own wine-tasting party, and learning to navigate a restaurant's wine list. Dottie and John's passion for wine will inspire you to sample types and labels you might never have thought (or had the nerve) to try. Their anecdotes and down-to-earth style will keep you turning the pages. Whether you are a curious novice or a connoisseur, this enhanced edition is an ideal choice for expanding your wine knowledge and taste.",

West examines the learning difficulties experienced by both famous and everyday people, and he explores how recent neurological research shows an association between visual talents and verbal difficulties. In the Mind's Eye probes new data on dyslexics to see how computers enhance the creative potential of visual thinkers, as well as interactive computer applications at all levels of education and work. Updated with a new preface, epilogue, and expanded notes, this volume could be the clarion call for educators and corporations to mine this untapped resource of highly creative talent in our midst.",

        "Title": "The Shortcut to Persuasive Presentations",
        "Authors": "By Tracy, Larry",
        "Description": "No less an authority on communication skills than President Ronald Reagan described Larry Tracy as \"an extraordinarily effective speaker.\" In this book, he provides the \"real world\"  experience-based lessons in presentation skills that earned  him such praise. Like his acclaimed workshops for corporate executives and government officials, this book is based on the assumption that people  who must improve their presentation skills, but  are pressed for time, require a \"shortcut,\" not lengthy books with numerous tips, checklists and page-filling anecdotes.  This book provides precisely that: A succinct, timesaving method for busy people to become better, more persuasive speakers.The system outlined in the book is a three step process: In Planning, you'll learn how to \"Get to the Point\" and intersect your objective with your audience's needs and problems through Larry's proven 3-1-2 System. You will also learn how to always have a \"Plan B Presentation\" ready for those occasions when your allotted time is reduced at the last minute. In Practicing, you'll learn how to hone your speaking skills, eliminate \"uh's\" and \"Y'knows,\" and anticipate questions and objections before the presentation with a unique practice method. In Presenting, you'll learn to convert your nervousness to audience-connecting enthusiasm, and to develop and use visuals, including PowerPoint slides, so they complement, not distract from, your message. You'll learn as well how to employ your voice and body language to reinforce content, including the use of rhetorical devices to make your presentations eloquent, memorable and persuasive. In summary, this book will show you how to organize and deliver your knowledge with laser-like intensity targeted to solving the problems of your various \"audiences\"-- Boards of Directors, shareholders, clients, customers, etc.-- so these audiences conclude  that (1) what you are proposing is in their best interests, and (2) you are an outstanding speaker. This book has so much practical and proven advice, presented in a clear and easy-to-learn manner, that you will never need to buy another book on presentation skills.",
