        "Description": "Looking for a travel guide that goes where other guides fear to tread? One that rides roughshod over ad-copy puffery to smartly deliver the real scoop on a destination's sites and attractions? One that dares to be honest, hip, and fun? Look no more. Frommer's Irreverent Travel Guides are wickedly irreverent, unabashedly honest, and downright hilarious, and provide an insider's perspective on which attractions are overrated tourist traps and which are the secret gems that locals love. You'll get the lowdown on restaurants, lodging, and shopping, and even find out what the locals think of you. \"Like being taken around by a savvy local,\" said the New York Times. \"Hipper and savvier than other guides,\" concurred Diversion magazine. Never shy about confronting the issues, the Irreverents are guides to real travel in the real world.The one-dimensional Amsterdam of tulips, wooden shoes, and 17th-century architecture is the stuff of many a standard guidebook, but with its booming economy, legalized prostitution, and tolerant attitude toward recreational drug use, the city is much more than that. For savvy travelers who want to fully experience the place as the locals live it, Frommer's Irreverent Guide to Amsterdam is the way to go, offering the lowdown on this hip, cultivated city, where old and new sunnily coexist. You'll discover the proper way to knock back genever (Dutch gin--the potent national spirit), why Amsterdam is considered the Gay Capital of Europe, plus the inside scoop on the red-light district, complete with advice and warnings.",

        "Description": "Everyone everywhere depends increasingly on long-distance food. Since 1961 the tonnage of food shipped between nations has grown fourfold. In the United States, food typically travels between 1,500 and 2,500 miles from farm to plate\u2014as much as 25 percent farther than in 1980. For some, the long-distance food system offers unparalleled choice. But it often runs roughshod over local cuisines, varieties, and agriculture, while consuming staggering amounts of fuel, generating greenhouse gases, eroding the pleasures of face-to-face interactions, and compromising food security. Fortunately, the long-distance food habit is beginning to weaken under the influence of a young, but surging, local-foods movement. From peanut-butter makers in Zimbabwe to pork producers in Germany and rooftop gardeners in Vancouver, entrepreneurial farmers, start-up food businesses, restaurants, supermarkets, and concerned consumers are propelling a revolution that can help restore rural areas, enrich poor nations, and return fresh, delicious, and wholesome food to cities.",

        "Title": "And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since: From the Streets of Harlem to the Halls of Congress",
        "Authors": "By Rangel, Charles B. and Wynter, Leon E.",
        "Description": "In this inspiring and often humorous memoir, the outspoken Democratic congressman from Harlem--now the chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee--tells about his early years on Lenox Avenue, being awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for wounds sustained in a horrific Korean War battle (the last bad day of his life, he says), and his many years in Congress.      A charming, natural storyteller, Rangel recalls growing up in Harlem, where from the age of nine he always had at least one job, including selling the legendary Adam Clayton Powell's newspaper; his group of streetwise sophisticates who called themselves Les Gar\u00e7ons; and his time in law school--a decision made as much to win his grandfather's approval as to establish a career. He recounts as well his life in New York politics during the 1960s and the grueling civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery.      With New York street smarts, Rangel is a tough liberal and an independent thinker, but also a collegial legislator respected by Democrats and Republicans alike who knows and honors the House's traditions. First elected to Congress in 1970, Rangel served on the House Judiciary Committee during the hearings on the articles of impeachment of President Nixon, helped found the Congressional Black Caucus, and led the fight in Congress to pressure U.S. corporations to divest from apartheid South Africa.      Best of all, this is a political memoir with heart, the story of a life filled with friends, humor, and accomplishments. Charles Rangel is one of a kind, and this is the story of how he became the celebrated person and politician he is today.      He opens his memoir with a preface about the 2006 elections and an outline of his goals as chairman of Ways and Means. From day one he wants to put the public first so that more Americans can say they haven't had a bad day since.",

With more than one million children diagnosed with ADD, the condition has gained national attention on talk shows, magazine covers and The New York Times bestseller list. Dr. Armstrong, well-known for his writings on parenting and education, presents the very real argument that ADD may, in fact, not exist. He believes that many behaviors labeled as ADD are simply a child's active response to complex social, emotional, and educational influences, and that by tackling the root causes of a child's attention and behavior problems\u2014rather than masking the symptoms with medication and behavior-modification programs\u2014parents can help their children begin to experience fundamentally positive changes in their lives.This groundbreaking book provides parents and professionals with 50 innovative and proven strategies they can use to help children overcome their attention and behavior problems. His checklist helps parents decide which strategies are most appropriate, and hundreds of resources, including books and organizations are included.  The Myth of the A.D.D.

        "Title": "Dean and Me: (A Love Story)",
        "Authors": "By Lewis, Jerry and Kaplan, James",
        "Description": "They were the unlikeliest of pairs\u2014a handsome crooner and a skinny monkey, an Italian from Steubenville, Ohio, and a Jew from Newark, N.J.. Before they teamed up, Dean Martin seemed destined for a mediocre career as a nightclub singer, and Jerry Lewis was dressing up as Carmen Miranda and miming records on stage. But the moment they got together, something clicked\u2014something miraculous\u2014and audiences saw it at once. Before long, they were as big as Elvis or the Beatles would be after them, creating hysteria wherever they went and grabbing an unprecedented hold over every entertainment outlet of the era: radio, television, movies, stage shows, and nightclubs. Martin and Lewis were a national craze, an American institution. The millions (and the women) flowed in, seemingly without end\u2014and then, on July 24, 1956, ten years from the day when the two men joined forces, it all ended. After that traumatic day, the two wouldn\u2019t speak again for twenty years. And while both went on to forge triumphant individual careers\u2014Martin as a movie and television star, recording artist, and nightclub luminary (and charter member of the Rat Pack); Lewis as the groundbreaking writer, producer, director, and star of a series of hugely successful movie comedies\u2014their parting left a hole in the national psyche, as well as in each man\u2019s heart.In a memoir by turns moving, tragic, and hilarious, Jerry Lewis recounts with crystal clarity every step of a fifty-year friendship, from the springtime, 1945 afternoon when the two vibrant young performers destined to conquer the world together met on Broadway and Fifty-fourth Street, to their tragic final encounter in the 1990s, when Lewis and his wife ran into Dean Martin, a broken and haunted old man.In Dean &  Me, Jerry Lewis makes a convincing case for Dean Martin as one of the great\u2014and most underrated\u2014comic talents of our era. But what comes across most powerfully in this definitive memoir is the depth of love Lewis felt, and still feels, for his partner, and which his partner felt for him: truly a love to last for all time.",

        "Description": "Pets are such a big part of so many of our lives. As any pet lover knows, a wagging tail or a tender purr can soothe the soul after a hard day. And sometimes, the presence of dogs and cats in our lives can do even more. In these delightful books, Callie Smith Grant collects stories that celebrate the dogs and cats in our lives--stories that touch our hearts, renew our spirit, and show us how God created these beasts for unique purposes. A funny little dog named Prince earns his title by protecting the children of the house. A \"dickens of a cat\" gives a cancer survivor something else to think about. A lively litter of puppies soothes a troubled child. A scrawny kitten helps an anorexic girl begin to eat.  Well-known authors, including Melody Carlson, Tracie Peterson, and Robert Benson, as well as new voices share their inspirational true stories of these otherwise ordinary cats and dogs whose presence in the lives of humans make them remarkable. Each book also includes interesting sidebars, memorable quotes, helpful hints for living with dogs and cats, and forewords by H. Norman Wright. The stories are warm, captivating, and ideal for a good curl-up-and-read or for a gift to any pet lover. Cat lovers, dog lovers, and anyone who likes to read uplifting stories will cherish these books.",

        "Description": "Finally, a book that focuses completely on the life of the \"grunt\" (infantry soldier) in Vietnam. The voices of more than sixty army and marine infantrymen speak with restrained elegance of their experiences from induction to the jungles and rice paddies of \"Indian country\" to their return to \"The World.\"From I Corps in the north to IV Corps in the south, and from the early days of 1965 to the American withdrawal in 1972, A Life in a Year offers a unique look at the grunt's war in Vietnam - as seen through the eyes of the soldiers themselves. The insights of these combat veterans are woven into the narrative, giving the reader a sense of what it was like to serve in an infantry unit fighting Viet Cong guerrillas and North Vietnamese regulars. Veterans can compare their own experiences to those of infantrymen who served in different time periods during the Vietnam era and in different parts of the country. Civilians and veterans who did not experience life in the \"boonies\" will appreciate the author's candid explanations of the war in terms that will help them to better understand the individual soldier's experience. This lively, topically arranged account will appeal to both scholars and casual readers alike. A Life in a Year is sure to become a classic and is a valuable addition to Vietnam War literature.",

        "Description": "Before his son enlisted for a season of Youth Soccer at the neighborhood Boys and Girls Club in College Park, Maryland, Jim Haner was just your typical white middle-class suburban father. And as a journalist for The Baltimore Sun, Haner was more likely to write about scoundrels than soccer.But his son had caught the bug, so Haner reluctantly found himself in a room full of anxious parents, listening to the Youth Soccer Commissioner proudly proclaim that \"soccer is the essence of being!\" He wondered, What's this all about? and before he knew it, he was giving pep talks to nine-year-olds in shin guards and cleats. As the coach of the Hornets, a ragtag team of ten boys and one determined girl, Haner found himself eating, sleeping, and dreaming soccer: the game became an overwhelming, all-consuming obsession. So he immersed himself in soccer lore, dug deep into the historical record, took road trips to meet the living greats, and funneled his research into an intimate portrait of the soccer craze from the bottom up, and from the past to the present. The coach-turned-soccer apostle describes how \"Mob Ball\" fever was spread when successive waves of immigrants arrived in the States from England, Europe, South America, and Africa. He traces the rises and falls in the game's popularity in the decades since, up to the current wave of \"soccermania.\" When 100,000 people showed up in Pasadena to see the Americans take the Women's World Cup title in 1999, it was clear that the craze had become unstoppable.Soccerhead is a timely meditation on the poetry and politics of the game - a memoir, a cultural history, and a reflection on the Zen-ness of the sport, all rolled into one.",

That Julian Trent only receives eight years seems all too lenient. Little does Mason expect that he'll be looking Trent in the eyes again much sooner than he'd ever imagined.Setting aside his barrister's wig, Mason heads to Sandown to don his racing silks. An amateur jockey, his true passion is to be found in the saddle on a Thoroughbred, pounding the turf in the heat of a steeplechase. But when a fellow rider is brutally murdered - a pitchfork driven through his chest - Mason's racing life soon becomes all too close to his working life. The prime suspect is one of their brethren, champion jockey Steve Mitchell; the evidence is overwhelming.Mason is reluctant to heed Mitchell's pleas for legal advice - but soon he finds himself at the centre of a sinister web of threat and intimidation. Mason is left fighting a battle of right and wrong, and more immediately, a battle of life and death...his own.",

And as a result, he's got one or two things to tell us about how it all works; and being Jeremy Clarkson he's not about to voice them quietly, humbly and without great dollops of humour. In The World According to Clarkson, he reveals why it is that: Too much science is bad for our health '70s rock music is nothing to be ashamed of Hunting foxes while drunk and wearing night-sights is neither big nor clever We must work harder to get rid of cricket He likes the Germans (well, sometimes) With a strong dose of common sense that is rarely, if ever, found inside the M25, Clarkson hilariously attacks the pompous, the ridiculous, the absurd and the downright idiotic, whilst also celebrating the eccentric, the clever and the sheer bloody brilliant. Less a manifesto for living and more a road map to modern life, The World According to Clarkson is the funniest book you'll read this year. Don't leave home without it.

        "Description": "In the late 1960's, in the small community of Bethel, Alaska, a beaten teenager named Dove Alexie is in prison.  One day, he mysteriously vanishes, and curiously, there is no mention of hi s arrival or departure on the prison records.  Four young people in Bethel tell their stories, and the narrative circles around Dove \u2013 their unseen companion. Told with humour and insight, Unseen Companion spins together four unique voices that capture the complexities of human existence and the search for one's place in the universe.  o Based on the author's own experiences living and doing social work in fourteen Alaskan bush villages, which left Orenstein uniquely qualified to write the kind of loss and hopelessness presented in this novel. o An intriguing and layered narrative structure, unique voices, and a brilliant over\u2013arching metaphor that sums up one's place in the universe make this a unique and resonant book that will stick with readers for years to come.  Ages 12 +",

At last Webber returns to America and rediscovers it with love, sorrow, and hope.  \"If there stills lingers and doubt as to Wolfe's right to a place among the immortals of American letters, this work should dispel it.\"--Cleveland News  \"Wolfe wrote as one inspired. No one of his generation had his command of language, his passion, his energy.\"--The New Yorker  \"You Can't Go Home Again will stand apart from everything else that he wrote because this is the book of a  man who had come to terms with himself, who has something profoundly important to say.\"--New York Times Book Review",

Chinese philosophers have understood geomancy (the art of placement) for more than two thousand years-and architects like I. M. Pei, businesses like Virgin Airways, and real estate moguls like Donald Trump are listening. Integrating interior design with the I Ching, feng shui (pronounced fung-schway) harmonizes our external and internal environments by creating balanced, peaceful dwellings in which we can develop health and happiness. its powerful secrets have been closely guarded for centuries-and what has been written tends to be mystifying and impractical. But reading Feng Shui Mode Easy is like having an expert visit your own home or office. William Spear is a sought-after consultant in the field-and with specific case studies, as well as fifty drawings that clearly demonstrate the subtle energy flow principles of the art of placement, he shows you how to easily apply the wisdom of geomancy to everyday living. \"Feng Shui Mode Easy tells you more than just how to rearrange your furniture, it tells you how to change your life.\" Home Shui Home!",
