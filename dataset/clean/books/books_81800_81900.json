        "Description": "For most of us, life has become such a pressure cooker of unrealistic expectations, information overload, relentless marketing, and workaholism that we spend our days stressed out over being stressed out. Guided by the timeless wisdom of her grandmother Francesca, renowned stress coach and humorist Loretta LaRoche makes us see the wisdom of a more civilized time, when no one carried a cell phone during a peaceful walk on the beach. In Life Is Not a Stress Rehearsal, Loretta takes an honest and hilarious look at the gizmos, self-help regimens, talking heads, comfort products, nutrition plans, and sexual freedoms that we have all come to believe will make our lives better. She shows us that in many ways, they\u2019re filling our lives with more stress and insanity and keeping us isolated from the thing that matters most in any healthy life: real human connection. With Loretta\u2019s contemporary wit and a hearty dose of Francesca's old-world wisdom, Life Is Not a Stress Rehearsal is a breath of fresh air for everyone who's suffocating in our techno-crazed, germ-phobic, \"go-go-go\" world.",

In this magisterial opus, capping a lifetime of work and personal experience, Dr. Yalom helps us recognize that the fear of death is at the heart of much of our anxiety. Such recognition is often catalyzed by an \"awakening experience\"\u2014a dream, or loss (the death of a loved one, divorce, loss of a job or home), illness, trauma, or aging.Once we confront our own mortality, Dr. Yalom writes, we are inspired to rearrange our priorities, communicate more deeply with those we love, appreciate more keenly the beauty of life, and increase our willingness to take the risks necessary for personal fulfillment.",

        "Description": "Leapfrogging advances in technology. Women at the top. Global expansion. Consolidation. Downsizing. Diversity issues. With the definitions of organizational success changing this fast, managers need a blueprint for dealing with complex new issues as they impact hiring, budgeting, rewarding, planning, organizing, and other core responsibilities.Managing in the Age of Change offers insights from 26 top managers - including Ken Blanchard and Natasha Jocephalus - on the major issues confronting managers today. These veterans of change give practical guidelines for developing the critical skills that will help managers respond to change quickly and effectively, including how to adapt to cultural differences in the workforce, how to avoid jumping from fad to fad in an attempt to stay current, and how to handle the expected outcomes of downsizing; eliminating the \"glass ceiling\" and working to combat racism in the workforce; transforming resistance into energy, and recognizing intergroup competition and conflict as positive dynamic forces; putting people back in control, and creating teams that can respond promptly to client, customer, and competitive demands; and handling the sensitive issues of cultural heritages.This definitive collection of articles by widely known management experts will serve as a guidepost for today's manager who, if not facing change today, should be prepared for change in the future. From Robert Marshak's essay on managing in chaotic times, to Mikki Ritvo's and Bill LeClair's guidelines to using consultants effectively, Managing in the Age of Change offers insights to all managers, at every stage of change, in every type of organization.",

The novel was inspired by  the story of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s purported sexual relationship with his slave Sally Hemings. Brown fictionalizes the stories of Jefferson\u2019s mistress, daughters, and granddaughters \u2014 all of whom are slaves \u2014 in order to demythologize the dominant U.S. cultural narrative celebrating Jefferson\u2019s America as a nation of freedom and equality for all. The documents in this edition include excerpts from Brown\u2019s sources for the novel \u2014 fiction, political essays, sermons, and presidential proclamations; selections that illuminate the range of contemporary attitudes concerning race, slavery, and prejudice; and pieces that advocate various methods of resistance and reform.",

This book answers these questions comprehensively, and with photographs and illustrations which help convey just what is so special about each aircraft.Over 250 of the world's most important, influential aircraft, from the first powered aircraft, the Wright Brother's 'Flyer' to Northrop's highly advanced B-2 stealth bomber. Commercial aircraft such as the Douglas DC-3 Dakota and the new A380 double decker Airbus, are detailed as are many of the classic fighters and bombers from World War II, such as the Supermarine Spitfire, North American P-51 Mustang and Boeing B-17 Fortress.All the essential detail is here. Fascinating histories of the design, development, manufacture, and service life of each aircraft are accompanied by a technical specification highlighting on its most important variants. Each is illustrated by a large and detailed color side view artwork, a three-view general arrangement line drawing, and supported with additional photographs.",

Now Grady breaks fresh thriller territory with Mad Dogs, a brilliant novel launched from a totally original creation: the CIA\u2019s secret insane asylum for \u201cretired\u201d agents. Five deranged CIA killers, all of them dependent on their meds and deep in the woods of Maine, are forced to break out of the asylum when someone murders their psychiatrist ---and frames them for the deed. Crazy and traumatized by their experiences in the CIA, they operate under somewhat skewed perceptions of the real world. Their training, however, has prepared them to survive in an unfriendly world---even if that world is the Boston-to-Washington corridor as they chase down the real killer.Suspenseful, fast, and edgy, as well as funny and humane, Mad Dogs is a stunning novel of political commentary and a tour-de-force of contemporary literary style, a look at twenty-first-century spy wars.",

        "Authors": "By Luntz, Frank I.",
        "Description": "No one in America has done more observing of more people than Dr. Frank I. Luntz. From Bill O'Reilly to Bill Maher, America's leading pundits, prognosticators, and CEOs turn to Luntz to explain the present and to predict the future. With all the upheavals of recent events, the plans and priorities of the American people have undergone a seismic shift. Businesses everywhere are trying to market products and services during this turbulent time, but only one man really understands the needs and desires of the New America.  From restaurant booths to voting booths, Luntz has watched and assessed our private habits, our public interests, and our hopes and fears. What are the five things Americans want the most? What do they really want in their daily lives? In their jobs? From their government? For their families? And how does understanding what Americans want allow businesses to thrive? Luntz disassembles the preconceived notions we have about one another and lays all the pieces of the American condition out in front of us, openly and honestly, then puts the pieces back together in a way that reflects the society in which we live. What Americans Really Want...Really is a real, if sometimes scary, discussion of Americans' secret hopes, fears, wants, and needs.  The research in this book represents a decade of face-to-face interviews with twenty-five thousand people and telephone polls with one million more, as well as the exclusive, first-ever \"What Americans Really Want\" survey. What Luntz offers is a glimpse into the American psyche, along with analysis that will rock assumptions and right business judgment. He proves that success in virtually any profession demands that we either understand what Americans really want, or suffer the consequences.  Praise for Frank Luntz:  \"When Frank Luntz invites you to talk to his focus group, you talk to his focus group.\"--President Barack Obama, spoken on June 28, 2007, to a PBS-sponsored focus group following the Democratic presidential debate at Howard University  \"Frank Luntz understands the American people better than anyone I know.\"  --Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House  \"The Nostradamus of pollsters.\"--Sir David Frost  \"America's top companies listen to Frank Luntz because he understands what customers want and what employees think. He has a keen sense of the American psyche and an outstanding command of language that empowers and persuades.\"  --Thomas J. Donohue, President & CEO, U.S. Chamber of Commerce",

Not everyone, however, agrees that Lucius Hostilius was murdered. Poison was apparently the means of death, but Lucius was terminally ill. It was only a matter of time. Although he hasn't any official investigative status, Corvinus can't resist doing a little amateur sleuthing. And he has barely begun when two other corpses turn up and he is formally on the case. Lucius had been suffering something of a personality change because of his illness, so there is no shortage of suspects among friends and family whom he had antagonized. But Corvinus goes up many a blind alley before arriving at the heart of the mystery. As we follow Marcus Corvinus, clue by clue, on his 10th case, we allow ourselves to be diverted by rumors of Meton\u2019s love life?and by an authentic recipe for fish pickle sauce.",

        "Description": "Heaven Belonged to God. The Sky Belonged to America's Aces.  From the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, to the last dogfight over Kyushu on July 2, 1945, America's fighter aces blasted their way across the skies of the Pacific and East Asia -- hurling their Warhawks and Wildcats, Lightnings and Thunderbolts, Mustangs and Corsairs -- against the best enemy ever sent aloft. Now, in their own words, forty American eagles vividly recreate the terror, exhilaration, and ultimate triumph of their crusade for airborne supremacy.  Stalk the air with 1st Lt. Jack Jones in his P-400, as he employs his bird-hunter instinct in the pursuit and destruction of the deadly metallic vultures of the enemy. Race with 1st Lt. Jim Swett as his F4F scores an unprecedented seven kills and earns him the Medal of Honor. Ride with Ensign Wendell Twelves on his first engagement in his Hellcat as he rescues stranded American airmen from the Pacific below -- and marauding Zeros above.",

        "Authors": "By Schwartz, Bob and Taylor, B. K. (ILT)",
        "Description": "I Run, Therefore I Am\u2014Nuts! takes a funny look at the peculiarities, quirks, and obsessions of runners of all abilities. Whether you fall in the middle of the pack, up near the front of the pack, or so far from any semblance of a pack that you&#39;re wondering if everyone went home already, you&#39;ll find plenty to laugh about in this book.I Run, Therefore I Am\u2014Nuts! is a comical examination of events that are near and dear to every runner&#39;s well-conditioned heart. As the Dave Barry of running, popular running humorist Bob Schwartz pokes fun at the idiosyncratic personalities of runners and the funny situations they encounter in training, eating, racing, preparing for races, and revolving their everyday lives around running. I Run, Therefore I Am\u2014Nuts! brings out the humor in situations that every type of runner can relate to: - The intricate art of drinking on the run from paper cups- Trying to reacquaint fingers to toes after years of tight hamstrings - Hitting the wall- Having your heart flutter with the newest cushioned training shoe- Discovering cross-training contraptions designed to strengthen your gluteus to its maximus- Getting excited about the latest flavor of energy gel on the marketAs any runner with tight hamstrings and a funny bone would, you&#39;ll laugh your way through these and many other amusing stories illustrated with cartoons by artist B.K. Taylor, whose drawings have appeared in many national publications, including Mad Magazine and National Lampoon. Author Bob Schwartz is America&#39;s funniest running writer. An avid, slightly over-the-top runner himself, he has completed countless marathons (but laments that excessive glycogen depletion at the finish prevents him from fully remembering each one) as well as all race distances from the 200 Meter Kids Snowman Shuffle (where he finished second after edging out a four-year-old at the finish line) to an ultramarathon of 50 miles (a feat he has no intention of repeating). In addition to his weekly syndicated newspaper column, he has had hundreds of humorous essays published in national and regional publications, including Runner&#39;s World, FootNotes, and Fitness Runner.For anyone who loves the aromatic smell of perspiration, who enjoys the exhilaration of exhaustion, who drinks solely from squirt bottles, or whose wardrobe is filled with reflective clothing\u2014this book is for you.",

The bloody stand made there by Leonidas and his small Spartan army in 480 B.C. has been hailed ever since as an outstanding example of patriotism, courage, and sacrifice. The ambitions of King Xerxes were vast. Having amassed a Persian army that was the largest force of men and ships ever assembled, he set out to conquer Greece, at the same time sending an army of Carthaginians to overrun Sicily. Thus the two forces planned to open the gates to the wealth of the western Mediterranean and march upon most of the known world.Ernle Bradford\u2019s narrative embraces the entire era of the invasion, from the building of the incredible wooden bridge across the Hellespont to the final crushing defeat of the Persian rear guard at the battle of Plat\u00e6a. There, as before, the Spartans were the decisive force, turning out in massive numbers. It was at Thermopyl\u00e6, however, that the fate of Xerxes\u2019s forces was determined by a small band of Spartans. In Thermopyl\u00e6, Ernle Bradford brings to life the personalities and fantastic battles of this epic period with unmatched skill and verve.",

An astonishing testament to the enduring resilience of love and the human spirit in the face of even the most oppressive, hopeless conditions, Daughter of China offers a compelling look at life inside the rigid walls of Communist China, revealing in fascinating detail Meihong Xu's inculcation into the system-a process so effective that she would willingly betray a friend or family member to prove her loyalty. Written with clear-eyed candor and stark eloquence, Daughter of China is at once a timeless, deeply moving story of a prohibited love affair and a dramatic depiction of life under Chinese Communism.",

        "Description": "The rise of South Korea is one of the most unexpected and inspirational developments of the latter part of our century. A few decades ago, the Koreans were an impoverished, agricultural people. In one generation they came out of the fields and into Silicon Valley. In 1997, this powerhouse of a nation reeled and almost collapsed as a result of a weak financial system and heavily indebted conglomerates. The world is now watching to see whether the Koreans will be able to reform and continue their stunning growth.Although Korea has only recently found itself a part of the global stage, it is a country with a rich and complex past. Early history shows that Koreans had a huge influence on ancient Japan, and their historic achievements include being the first culture to use metal movable type for printing books. However, much of their history is less positive; it is marred with political violence, poverty, and war-aspects that would sooner be forgotten by the Koreans, who are trying to focus on their promising future.The fact that Korean history has eluded much of the world is unfortunate, but as Korea becomes more of a global player, understanding and appreciation for this unique nation has become indispensable.In The Koreans, Michael Breen provides an in-depth portrait of the country and its people. an early overview of the nature and values of the Korean people provides the background for a more detailed examination of the complex history of the country, in particular its division into the Communist north and pro-Western south.In this absorbing and enlightening account of the Koreans, Michael Breen provides compelling insight into the history and character of this fascinating nation.",

        "Description": "When you first get a PC, you want to do something with it. You didn't buy it to learn about it any more than you buy a car to learn about its engine. You want to write a letter, send an email message, check out some Web sites, make a greeting card, or personalize the Windows desktop. Whatever it is you want to do, you don't want to have to read a book describing what a Pentium processor is or how your AGP adapter produces the pretty image on the screen. You want something more tangible; you want to do something practical. The only trouble is that the darn computer won't cooperate. It's just not as easy as it looks. That's the purpose of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Computer Basics. This book identifies the 20-30 tasks that you as a PC novice want to perform and then it draws a map showing you how to achieve your goal. You'll follow simple steps to print a greeting card, reconcile a checkbook balance, decorate the Windows desktop, make the PC run faster, and more.",

        "Authors": "By Gasparino, Charles",
        "Description": "A Long Way to the TopRags-to-riches stories abound in American lore, but even Horatio Alger would have been hard-pressed to write one as powerful as Richard Grasso's: the son of a working-class family whose childhood dream was to become a cop, he grew up in New York City's outer boroughs, as far removed from the marble halls, expensive suits, and imported cigars of the New York Stock Exchange as if his grandparents had remained in Italy. Here is the riveting story of how the \"Little Man in the Dark Suit\" rose to become the most influential CEO in the Exchange's history. Minus the tony upbringing, affluent prep schools, or inside connections that were de rigueur for top Wall Street players, Grasso would master the subtle deal-making and politics necessary to succeed in the most competitive business on Earth.The Day the Market FellThe story of September 11, 2001\u2014the shock, panic, resilience, and heroism\u2014is one that's been told many times. But on that day, Richard Grasso faced a challenge no other CEO of the Club had ever imagined: how to bring the very heart of global finance back from near-death to functioning operation. Swiftly, completely, and without the public knowing how desperate the struggle really was. He met it with aplomb: his finest hour, and yet one that sowed the seeds of his own destruction.A Plutocrat's PayAs the Exchange leapt from success to success, and Grasso's reputation, already gold-plated following 9/11, grew with it, the Club's Board of Directors lavishly rewarded him with a pay package that even the CEOs at the world's largest corporations might envy: more than $140 million in deferred compensation. It was a package that, when leaked, brought down a hailstorm of protest; bitter divisions among the most powerful names on Wall Street; an investigation from the \"Scourge of Wall Street,\" then\u2013Attorney General Eliot Spitzer; and Grasso's eventual humiliating downfall.The End of an EraAlmost single-handedly, Grasso had kept the famous specialist system, where human traders matched buy and sell orders, front and center at the Club. As competing camps plotted his downfall, the exchange's fate became clear: without Grasso, it might survive and indeed flourish, but the Exchange, the firms that supplied it with business, and the structures underpinning the movement of money around the country and the globe would never be the same.",

        "Title": "Lincoln's Men: How President Lincoln Became Father to an Army and a Nation",
        "Authors": "By Davis, William C.",
        "Description": "I sit down to write you (a Soldier's Friend!)...My kind Friend of Friends you have the power to help me a grate deal...I have great Confidence in our Good President hoe has dun a grate deal for us poor Soldiers...  So wrote Private Joe Hass to Abraham Lincoln, February 20, 1864. Like an extraordinary number of his fellow Union soldiers, he loved Lincoln as a father. Lincoln inspired feelings unlike those instilled by any previous commander-in-chief in America. In Lincoln's Men, William C. Davis draws on thousands of unpublished letters and diaries to tell the hidden story of how a new and untested president could become \"Father Abraham\" throughout both the army and the North as a whole.  How did the Army of the Potomac, yearning for the grandeur of McClellan, turn instead to the comfort of Old Abe, and how was this change of loyalty crucial to final victory? How did Lincoln inspire the faith and courage of so many shattered men, wandering the inferno of Shiloh or entrenched in the siege of Vicksburg? Why did soldiers visiting Washington feel free to stroll into the White House and sit down to relax, as if it were their own home?  Davis removes layers of mythmaking to recapture the moods and feelings of an army facing one of history's bloodiest conflicts. Tracing the popular fate of decisions to invoke conscription, to fire McClellan, and to free the slaves, Lincoln's Men casts a new light on our most famous president -- the light, that is, of the peculiar mass medium that was the Union Army. A motley band of talkers and letter writers, the soldiers spread news of Lincoln's appearances like wildfire, chortling at his ungainly posture in the saddle, rushing up to shake his hand and talk to him. The volunteers knew they could approach \"Old Abe,\" \"Honest Abe,\" \"Uncle Abe,\" and \"Father Abraham,\" and they cheered him thunderously. \"The men could not be restrained from so honoring him,\" said Private Rice Bull. \"He really was the ideal of the Army.\"  The story of the making of Father Abraham is the story of America's second revolution, its rebirth. As one Union soldier and journalist put it, \"Washington taught the world to know us, Lincoln taught us to know ourselves. The first won for us our independence, the last wrought out",

But she returns to find trouble brewing and tongues wagging at fever pitch. The local old-folks' home has been sold to a mysterious outsider, and overnight the place has been transformed into the Stonebridge Foundation, an exclusive rehabilitation center complete with a stone-faced guard who doesn't speak a word of English and an even nastier dog. Soon there are rumors flying of mental patients roaming the countryside at night, and every character in town is keeping a gun close at hand, just in case. Everyone is dying to know what goes on behind those inhospitable gates, with the exception of Arly, who has enough rural business to keep her satisfied.When the beautiful young receptionist found drowned in the garden pool is identified as a local girl from nearby Farberville, it's dear the case may not only involve the suspicious characters who've recently moved to town, but also some of the citizens of Maggody, who may have a secret or two to hide themselves. There's the doctor who can't resist a dose of his own medicine and a roster of patients that reads like a who's who of tabloid headlines, as well as the local pastor who gets his spiritual inspiration with a little help from the sacramental wine, and the mayor's wife who makes it her business to know everything about everyone. Soon Arly finds herself on the trail of a killer and discovers she may be the only innocent person left in town.",
