God had come near ... for you.Travel back in time and relive Christ the Son of God becoming man. Come with Max as he brings to life the most important event in history ... when God came near. And as you catch a vision of this incredible moment, let it mark the beginning of a new life for yourself.God came near. If he is who he says he is, there is no truth more worthy of your time.",

You don\u2019t stand in line at  Starbucks\u00ae just to buy a cup of coffee. You stop for the experience surrounding the  cup of coffee.Too many of us line up for God out of duty or guilt. We completely  miss the warmth and richness of the experience of living with God. If we\u2019d learn  to see what God is doing on earth, we could participate fully in the irresistible  life that he offers. You can learn to pay attention like never before, to identify  where God is already in business right in your neighborhood. The doors are open and  the coffee is brewing. God is serving the refreshing antidote to the unsatisfying,  arms-length spiritual life\u2013and he won\u2019t even make you stand in line.",

Someone is also fooling around with the space-time continuum, and the preternaturally gifted teenager turns out to hold the key to both the secrets of nuclear fission and breakthroughs in the fourth dimension. In the subterranean laboratory, he brainstorms with Robert Oppenheimer and other scientists who will soon be at Los Alamos. Meanwhile, upstairs, the displays in the museum come to life after hours, and an adventurous First Lady from the inaugural-gowns exhibit takes it upon herself to show him the sexual ropes.Abraham Lincoln - along with Charles Lindbergh, Eleanor Roosevelt, Albert Einstein, Grover Cleveland, and Adolf Hitler - turns up here as the teenage narrator tries not only to make sense of history but to intervene in key events that shaped the twentieth century. Questions about political responsibility and personal sacrifice are deftly woven into a surreal narrative of quantum physics, string theory, clones, the sexual habits of Eskimos, and the domestic arrangements of various U.S. presidents.",

Scenes from the lives of both the landed gentry and the impoverished working class offer a subtle but well-rounded perspective of social conditions in England during the late 19th century. Animal lovers of all ages will cherish this memorable story.",

The pursuit of Green leads across generations, a trail of deception and murder that began with a woman's fall from a Bronx rooftop almost fifty years earlier.Barkley's odyssey finally brings him to the door of a retired detective haunted by a case he never solved.

        "Description": "In the most ingenious and provocative thriller yet from the acclaimed New York Times bestselling author Jeffery Deaver, a conscience-plagued mobster turned government hitman struggles to find his moral compass amid rampant treachery and betrayal in 1936 Berlin.  Paul Schumann, a German American living in New York City in 1936, is a mobster hitman known as much for his brilliant tactics as for taking only \"righteous\" assignments. But then Paul gets caught. And the arresting officer offers him a stark choice: prison or covert government service. Paul is asked to pose as a journalist covering the summer Olympics taking place in Berlin. He's to hunt down and kill Reinhard Ernst -- the ruthless architect of Hitler's clandestine rearmament. If successful, Paul will be pardoned and given the financial means to go legit; if he refuses the job, his fate will be Sing Sing and the electric chair.  Paul travels to Germany, takes a room in a boardinghouse near the Tiergarten -- the huge park in central Berlin but also, literally, the \"Garden of Beasts\" -- and begins his hunt. In classic Deaver fashion, the next forty-eight hours are a feverish cat-and-mouse chase, as Paul stalks Ernst through Berlin while a dogged Berlin police officer and the entire Third Reich apparatus search frantically for the American.  Garden of Beasts is packed with fascinating period detail and features a cast of perfectly realized locals, Olympic athletes and senior Nazi officials -- some real, some fictional. With hairpin plot twists, the reigning \"master of ticking-bomb suspense\" (People) plumbs the nerve-jangling paranoia of prewar Berlin and steers the story to a breathtaking and wholly unpredictable ending.",

        "Title": "A New Religious America: How a \"Christian Country\" Has Become the World's Most Religiously Diverse Nation",
        "Authors": "By Eck, Diana L.",
        "Description": "\"The United States is the most religiously diverse nation in the world,\" leading religious scholar Diana Eck writes in this eye-opening guide to the religious realities of America today. The Immigration Act of 1965 eliminated the quotas linking immigration to national origins. Since then, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Jams, Zoroastrians, and new varieties of Jews and Catholics have arrived from every part of the globe, radically altering the religious landscape of the United States. Members of the world's religions live not just on the other side of the world but in our neighborhoods; Hindu children go to school with Jewish children; Muslims, Buddhists, and Sikhs work side-by-side with Protestants and Catholics.This new religious diversity is now a Main Street phenomenon, yet many Americans remain unaware of the profound change taking place at every level of our society, from local school boards to Congress, and in small-town Nebraska as well as New York City. Islamic centers and mosques, Hindu and Buddhist temples, and meditation centers can be found in virtually every major American metropolitan area. There are Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists in Salt Lake City, Utah; Toledo, Ohio; and Jackson, Mississippi. Buddhism has become an American religion, as communities widely separated in Asia are now neighbors in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Chicago. Eck discovers Muslims worshiping in a U-Haul dealership in Pawtucket, Rhode Island; a gymnasium in Oklahoma City; and a former mattress showroom in Northridge, California. Hindu temples are housed in a warehouse in Queens, a former YMCA in New Jersey, and a former Methodist church in Minneapolis.How Americans of all faiths and beliefs can engage with one another to shape a positive pluralism is one of the essential questions -- perhaps the most important facing American society. While race has been the dominant American social issue in the past century, religious diversity in our civil and neighborly lives is emerging, mostly unseen, as the great challenge of the twenty-first century. Diana Eck brilliantly analyzes these developments in the richest and most readable investigation of American society since Robert Bellah's classic, The Habits of the Heart. What Eck gives us in A New Religious America is a portrait of the diversity of religion in modern America, complete with engaging characters, fascinating stories, the tragedy of misunderstanding and hatred, and the hope of new friendships, offering a road map to guide us all in the richly diverse America of the twenty-first century.An eye-opening Account of the changing Landscape of AmericaThe 1990s saw the U.S. Navy commission its first Muslim chaplain and open its first mosque.There are presently more than three hundred temples in Los Angeles, home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world.There are more American Muslims than there are American Episcopalians, Jews, or Presbyterians.",

How come?\" These are examples of lateral thinking puzzles. You're given a statement about a situation that you have to use as a starting point to arrive at a particular explanation or solution. Often there can be many possible scenarios to explain the puzzle, but the challenge is that you have to find the \"right\" answer. Typically the puzzles contain insufficient information for you to immediately figure out the solution (clues are provided). When you get stuck, attack the problem from a new direction--think laterally! Not only are these puzzles fun, they also help to develop skills in questioning, deduction, logic, and, of course, lateral thinking.

Here it all is, straight from the horse's, er, mouth.With new Bushisms coming fast and furious in this election season, ace Bushism editor Jacob Weisberg offers a must-read compendium and \"explanation\" of the first term. Read President Bush's eye-popping description of his economic policy: \"See, without the tax relief package, there would have been a deficit, but there wouldn't have been the commiserate -- not 'commiserate' -- the kick to our economy that occurred as a result of the tax relief.\"Got that? How about this analysis of the weapons proliferation problem, from the man with his finger on the Button: \"Free nations don't develop weapons of mass destruction.\"Or his belief in the importance of staying connected to us all: \"[A]s you know, these are open forums, you're able to come and listen to what I have to say.\"The Deluxe Edition also includes reality checks: coherent Bush statements about major issues that bear no relation to the truth.The Deluxe Election-Edition Bushisms is essential reading for everyone still wondering what the past four years have all been about.",

        "Description": "When doctors told Art Buchwald that his kidneys were kaput, the renowned humorist declined dialysis and checked into a Washington, D.C., hospice to live out his final days. Months later, \u201cThe Man Who Wouldn\u2019t Die\u201d was still there, feeling good, holding court in a nonstop \u201csalon\u201d for his family and dozens of famous friends, and confronting things you usually don\u2019t talk about before you die; he even jokes about them.Here Buchwald shares not only his remarkable experience\u2013as dozens of old pals from Ethel Kennedy to John Glenn to the Queen of Swaziland join the party\u2013but also his whole wonderful life: his first love, an early brush with death in a foxhole on Eniwetok Atoll, his fourteen champagne years in Paris, fame as a columnist syndicated in hundreds of newspapers, and his incarnation as hospice superstar. Buchwald also shares his sorrows: coping with an absent mother, childhood in a foster home, and separation from his wife, Ann. He plans his funeral (with a priest, a rabbi, and Billy Graham, to cover all the bases) and strategizes how to land a big obituary in The New York Times (\u201cMake sure no head of state or Nobel Prize winner dies on the same day\u201d). He describes how he and a few of his famous friends finagled cut-rate burial plots on Martha\u2019s Vineyard and how he acquired a Picasso drawing without really trying.What we have here is a national treasure, the complete Buchwald, uncertain of where the next days or weeks may take him but unfazed by the inevitable, living life to the fullest, with frankness, dignity, and humor. \u201c[Art Buchwald] has given his friends, their families, and his audiences so many laughs and so much joy through the years that that alone would be an enduring legacy. But Art has never been just about the quick laugh. His humor is a road map to essential truths and insights that might otherwise have eluded us.\u201d\u2013Tom Brokaw",

It has been the passion of her heart to study what God's Word has to say about this and then share her liberty with other hurting souls.

The United States has used its fast-developing military technology to lock the invaders into a standoff. And in China, the ragtag revolutionary army of Mao Tse-tung - armed with Russian-supplied, German-made weapons - may prove the Race's most intractable enemy of all.On Earth, the alien invaders find themselves confronting a far more complex and difficult species than any they have encountered before. From the hatred between the Jews and the Deutsche to the irrepressible inventiveness of human technology, the reptilian invaders realize they have met creatures that cannot be tamed. Ultimately, only superior firepower may keep Earth under the Empire's control - or may destroy the world.Despite its military superiority, the Race still fears it underestimates its foes.

From the zeros of mathematicians to the void of philosophers, from Shakespeare to the null set, from the ether to the quantum vacuum, this book illustrates the fact that nothing is real.  Barrow begins with the origins of zero in ancient India, its rocky reception in Europe, and the early abhorrence and eventual acceptance of the concept of the void by Christianity. He traces the notion through the work of writers and thinkers from the ancient Greeks to our own time. He looks at mathematics, cosmology, theology, and  physics to uncover the nothing that is at the heart of most things. Finally, he discusses recent concepts of nothing, which are having profound effects on our search for the origins and overall structure of the universe.lluminating the many ways in which humankind has come to understand \u201cnothing,\u201d The Book of Nothing brilliantly belies its title.",

        "Description": "Here are the original Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle as they first appeared in the famed British magazine The Strand.  This periodical was the literary sensation of its time, especially with the publication of the novel The Hound of the Baskervilles (which appears in its entirety in this volume), when eager readers lined up outside the magazine's London offices, waiting for each installment as it came off press.This edition contains 37 short stories, reproduced in complete facsimile (published in individual volumes as \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\", The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\", and \"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\"), plus the complete novel The Hound of the Baskervilles. Today, the collection of the original issues of The Strand containing the Holmes stories is a rare collector's piece.  It is brought to you now, complete and unabridged, comprising a total of well over 600 pages, providing the undying excitement and fascination of each and every Sherlock Holmes Adventure. The drawings of Sidney Paget illustrate the stories--illustrations as immortal as the stories themselves.  Paget produced more than 350 Sherlock Holmes illustrations, and it was his depictions which gave Holmes visual reality for everyone, which projected him throughout the world, and which today still provide the mold of the original hero in production on stage, screen and television.",

        "Authors": "By Evans, Richard Paul",
        "Description": "When I wrote my first book, The Christmas Box, it was an intensely personal expression. To me, The Locket has that quality too.  When I was sixteen, a high school sociology teacher gave us the assignment to visit a nursing home resident every week for the duration of her course.  My first meeting with my adopted resident, Lucille, was as awkward as I imagine a blind date with someone else's great-grandmother would be: Each attempt at conversation was met with blank, dubious stares.  Through time, I soon learned that I was Lucille's only visitor. That she spent her weekends and holidays alone in her small room, looking out at the pastoral landscape of the care facility. My attitude began to change. Lucille never spoke to me, never even learned my name, but I began to see something change in her demeanor whenever I visited. A quiet gratitude, perhaps. A friendship.  Two months later the assignment ended, but not my visits. I continued to spend time with Lucille until the day I walked in to find an orderly stripping her bed. When I asked Where Lucille was, the busy orderly replied, \"She died yesterday.\"  It was only then that I realized the extent of my connection with Lucille. I left the facility deeply saddened that I never got the chance to say good-bye. I never went back.  That is, until I wrote The Locket. As I began to write the story of Michael Keddington and Esther Huish, I found that I had returned to that quiet room.  The Locket, like all of my novels, is a love story. A story about the young love of Michael and Faye and the challenges they face. It is also a story of old love, between Esther and the man she lost so many years before. But, ultimately, it is a story of the love between generations, and the nurturing and forgiveness those relationships always require.  My hope is for you to come to understand the many gifts the elderly can bring to our lives. And, most of all, that in reading The Locket, you, and those with whom you share my story, will be brought closer to those you love and those whom you should.
