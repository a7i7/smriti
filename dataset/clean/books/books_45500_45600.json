        "Authors": "By Evans, Robert",
        "Description": "Students everywhere are harder to reach and teach, their attention and motivation less reliable, their language and behavior more provocative.? This is largely because parents, suffering a widespread loss of confidence and competence, are increasingly anxious about their children?s success, yet increasingly unable to support and guide them?and increasingly assertive and adversarial vis a vis the school.? Examining these trends and their underlying causes, Evans calls for a combination of limits and leverage.? At the policy level, we must rethink our notions of accountability, accepting the reality that schools cannot overcome all the forces that affect children?s lives and learning.? At the schoolhouse, educators can improve their impact by clarifying and asserting purpose (core values) and conduct (norms for behavior), and by becoming more appropriately parental vis ? vis students and parents.? Evans outlines concrete ways to implement these measures, and closes with a reflection on ways to sustain hope and commitment in the face of unprecedented challenge.\"Too many Americans are eager to blame the media or teachers for their children's failure to learn. In Family Matters Rob Evans has the courage to tell the simple truth: parents in America are abdicating their responsibilities. They are not sending children to school who are ready to learn, and educators are being overwhelmed by the behavioral problems and emotional needs of under-parented children. In this persuasive and powerful book, Dr. Evans cuts through our national denial and offers both a hard-headed analysis of our parenting failures and realistic school-based solutions to these problems.\"?Michael Thompson, coauthor, Raising Cain and Best Friends, Worst Enemies\"In a brave and winning combination of information, analysis, anecdotes, and personal observations, Rob Evans makes a forthright, powerful case for renewed and respectful school-family collaboration on behalf of children.\"Theodore R.

His days are a dull routine of work, loneliness, and regret. Then, on his 83rd birthday, Eddie dies in a tragic accident, trying to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakens in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a lush Garden of Eden, but a place where your earthly life is explained to you by five people.

As the story builds to its stunning conclusion, Eddie desperately seeks redemption in the still-unknown last act of his life: Was it a heroic success or a devastating failure The answer, which comes from the most unlikely of sources, is as inspirational as a glimpse of heaven itself.

It revolves around a single, forbidden act of passion that forever alters the lives of three members of a small Puritan community: Hester Prynne, an ardent and fierce woman who bears the punishment of her sin in humble silence; the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, a respected public figure who is inwardly tormented by long-hidden guilt; and the malevolent Roger Chillingworth, Hester\u2019s husband?a man who seethes with an Ahab-like lust for vengeance.The landscape of this classic novel is uniquely American, but the themes it explores are universal?the nature of sin, guilt, and penitence, the clash between our private and public selves, and the spiritual and psychological cost of living outside society. Constructed with the elegance of a Greek tragedy, The Scarlet Letter brilliantly illuminates the truth that lies deep within the human heart.Nancy Stade is trained as a lawyer and has worked in the federal government and the private sector.

        "Description": "Stealth, impersonation, bribery, lock picking, ducking the cops. Oh, yes, and the odd bit of photography, too. No, the paparazzi don't have it easy. They're reviled by their subjects, by their employers, by their voyeuristic audience\u2014and by the fashion and news photographers who think of themselves as artists and the paparazzi as creeps with cameras. They're the bottom feeders who shoot celebrities in all their infamy: drunk, undressed, distressed, lip-locked wih folks who aren't their spouses. They're the hunters and chasers who've nabbed on film everyone from Pamela Anderson to Princess Diana. And we all love it. We may not want to admit it, but we can't get enough of these photos, keeping the paparazzi in business by buying everything from People to the National Enquirer and all the fan magazines and tabloids in between. Paparazzi turns the spotlight on these photographers and their highly paid profession; on the celebrities who are the object of their lenses; and on the society that begs them to capture these megastars in both ordinary and compromising positions.

There are plenty of books that tell the reader how to install trim around windows and doors, but few that also explain how architectural trim can enhance a room's aesthetic appeal.  Responding to the recent trend of building houses as empty boxes, author Jay Silber shows readers how to choose and use a wide variety of moldings, trim, and design concepts to transform a sterile, open floor plan into a warm, inviting, richly textured home.  Trimwork shows readers how to decorate their homes with trim and wall panels so that their walls, passageways, and stairways can radiate the warmth, character, and beauty of the well-trimmed homes of eras gone by.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Book of American Short Stories",

        "Description": "\"How ironic,\" Joyce Carol Oates writes in her introduction to this marvelous collection, \"that in our age of rapid mass-production and the easy proliferation of consumer products, the richness and diversity of the American literary imagination should be so misrepresented in most anthologies.\" Why, she asks, when writers such as Samuel Clemens, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Saul Bellow, and John Updike have among them written hundreds of short stories, do anthologists settle on the same two or three titles by each author again and again? \"Isn't the implicit promise of an anthology that it will, or aspires to, present something different, unexpected?\"     In The Oxford Book of American Short Stories, Joyce Carol Oates offers a sweeping survey of American short fiction, in a collection of fifty-six tales that combines classic works with many \"different, unexpected\" gems, and that invites readers to explore a wealth of important pieces by women and minority writers. Some selections simply can't be improved on, Oates admits, and she happily includes such time-honored works as Irving's \"Rip Van Winkle,\" Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" and Hemingway's \"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.\" But alongside these classics, Oates introduces such little-known stories as Mark Twain's \"Cannibalism in the Cars,\" a story that reveals a darker side to his humor (\"That morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to...a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy\"). From Melville come the juxtaposed tales \"The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids,\" of which Oates says, \"Only Melville could have fashioned out of 'real' events...such harrowing and dreamlike allegorical fiction.\" From Flannery O'Connor we find \"A Late Encounter With the Enemy,\" and from John Cheever, \"The Death of Justina,\" one of Cheever's own favorites, though rarely anthologized. The reader will also delight in the range of authors found here, from Charles W. Chesnutt, Jean Toomer, and Sarah Orne Jewett, to William Carlos Williams, Kate Chopin, and Zora Neale Hurston. Contemporary artists abound, including Bharati Mukherjee and Amy Tan, Alice Adams and David Leavitt, Bobbie Ann Mason and Tim O'Brien, Louise Erdrich and John Edgar Wideman. Oates provides fascinating introductions to each writer, blending biographical information with her own trenchant observations about their work, plus a long introductory essay, in which she offers the fruit of years of reflection on a genre in which she herself is a master.   This then is a book of surprises, a fascinating portrait of American short fiction, as filtered through the sensibility of a major modern writer.",

The deep attraction between them is immediate ... and potentially explosive, with risk at every turn.

        "Description": "In April 1994, black and white South Africans voted for the first time for a nonracial government. This watershed election in the spring of '94 was one of many profound changes in Southern Africa, including independence in Namibia, democratic elections in Zambia, a peace agreement in Mozambique, and renewed civil war in Angola.The authors explore the sources and dynamics of the political, economic, and diplomatic transformations that took place in Southern Africa. They recount how Southern Africa has long endured costly, violent domestic and interstate conflicts, often complicated and intensified by external interventions and interests. They also analyze the various attempts to resolve Southern Africa's conflicts. They suggest that the democratic transition in South Africa has opened the possibility to create a secure Southern Africa, but they also note that past conflict legacies and new unanticipated conflicts could stand in the way. The challenge ahead will be to create new institutions at the national and regional levels that can help political players resolve conflict without resorting to violence.",

        "Authors": "By Kepel, Gilles",
        "Description": "The late twentieth century has witnessed the emergence of an unexpected and extraordinary phenomenon: Islamist political movements. Beginning in the early 1970s, militants revolted against the regimes in power throughout the Muslim world and exacerbated political conflicts everywhere. Their jihad, or \u201cHoly Struggle,\u201d aimed to establish a global Islamic state based solely on a strict interpretation of the Koran. Religious ideology proved a cohesive force, gathering followers ranging from students and the young urban poor to middle-class professionals.After an initial triumph with the Islamic revolution in Iran, the movement waged jihad against the USSR in Afghanistan, proclaiming for the first time a doctrine of extreme violence. By the end of the 1990s, the failure to seize political power elsewhere led to a split: movement moderates developed new concepts of \u201cMuslim democracy\u201d while extremists resorted to large-scale terrorist attacks around the world.Jihad is the first extensive, in-depth attempt to follow the history and geography of this disturbing political-religious phenomenon. Fluent in Arabic, Gilles Kepel has traveled throughout the Muslim world gathering documents, interviews, and archival materials inaccessible to most scholars, in order to give us a comprehensive understanding of the scope of Islamist movements, their past, and their present. As we confront the threat of terrorism to our lives and liberties, Kepel helps us make sense of the ominous reality of jihad today.",

L\u2019Amour \u2019s legacy of work remains unparalleled, setting a standard of excellence that few other writers have matched.  Now With These Hands pulls together some of L\u2019Amour's very best work--eleven newly rediscovered stories that have never before appeared in a single volume. WITH THESE HANDSFrom a South Seas island paradise to the icy reaches of the Arctic, from the dark, gritty streets of urban America to the rugged landscape of the untamed West, the stories gathered in With These Hands combine razor-sharp characters with breathtaking action and historic detail.  Here are tales of adventure, mystery, passion, suspense, and the Old West as only L\u2019Amour  can tell them.  The result is a collection that profoundly echoes the highs and lows of the human experience, while proving that life\u2019s most vital moments can occur when and where we least expect them.All of the classic L\u2019Amour themes are represented: honor, loyalty, and standing up for what\u2019s right despite the odds. These dramatic stories grab hold of the reader with a power and immediacy unsurpassed by any other writer. An exotic island in the Coral Sea is transformed into a tropical nightmare when it\u2019s taken over by a band of hijackers--and only a daredevil pilot can stop their brutal carnage. A former boxer blows the lid off a vicious crime ring--and finds that his worst enemy is not a thug with a gun but his own tenacious curiosity. A down-on-his-luck rancher discovers the key to his own redemption--and desperately hopes that his revelation has not come too late for him to win the one thing he wants most of all. A private eye navigates the twists and turns of a labyrinthine whodunit--and proves that the greatest risk to a man\u2019s honor is his own greed. The title story \u201cWith These Hands\u201d is a powerful tale that celebrates the triumph of the human spirit, as an oil company executive finds himself the sole survivor of an Arctic plane crash. Fighting for his life against the perilous cold and looming starvation, he resists the temptation to surrender to death--only to discover a life-affirming strength he never knew he had. Vivid in scope and displaying the diverse talents of a master storyteller, the stories in With These Hands are certain to be treasured by both old and new fans, celebrating the incomparable imagination of a timeless American author.",

In his international bestsellers The Tao of Physics and The Turning Point, he juxtaposed physics and mysticism to define a new vision of reality. In The Web of Life, Capra takes yet another giant step, setting forth a new scientific language to describe interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena--the \"web of life.\"During the past twenty-five years, scientists have challenged conventional views of evolution and the organization of living systems and have developed new theories with revolutionary philosophical and social implications. Fritjof Capra has been at the forefront of this revolution. In The Web of Life, Capra offers a brilliant synthesis of such recent scientific breakthroughs as the theory of complexity, Gaia theory, chaos theory, and other explanations of the properties of organisms, social systems, and ecosystems. Capra's surprising findings stand in stark contrast to accepted paradigms of mechanism and Darwinism and provide an extraordinary new foundation for ecological policies that will allow us to build and sustain communities without diminishing the opportunities for future generations.Now available in paperback for the first time, The Web of Life is cutting-edge science writing in the tradition of James Gleick's Chaos, Gregory Bateson's Mind and Matter, and Ilya Prigogine's Order Out of Chaos.",

        "Title": "On Glorious Wings: The Best Flying Stories of the Century",
        "Authors": "By Coonts, Stephen (EDT)",
        "Description": "Since its invention in 1903, the airplane has become the dominant mode of transport, travel, and combat.  It has brought the entire planet closer together and changed almost every aspect of how we live today.Along the way, the airplane has inspired writers in every decade of the twentieth century to celebrate this world-changing creation.  From the wild first years of aviation when daredevil men challenged each other to set altitude records to the terrible three-dimensional landscape of combat in the air through all the wars of this century, authors from around the world have written of the airplanes and the men and women who fly them.Now, bestselling author Stephen Coonts has collected some of the finest fiction about flying in one volume. On Glorious Wings contains stories and excerpts from world-renowned authors, including Dale Brown, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Louis L'Amour, James Michener, Joseph Heller, Len Deighton, Frederick Forsyth, William Faulkner, Ralph Peters and Stephen Coonts himself.  From the rickety wire-and-wood contraptions of the 1920s to the possible future of warfare in 2020, this collection invites you to take to the skies with some of today's most acclaimed authors, including:\"Five Weeks in a Balloon\" by Jules Verne: Take a fanciful trip through the air as imagined by one of the great authors of the nineteenth century.\"All of the Dead Pilots\" by William Faulkner: One of America's greatest storytellers looks at Britain in World War II, where a brash American pilot and an unflappable British officer clash over the same woman.\"Wings over Khabarovsk\" by Louis L'Amour: The great Western writer also penned many tales for the pulp magazines of the 1930s and '40s, including this classic of the genre about an American pilot framed for spying on the far side of the world.\"An Hour to San Francisco,\" from The High and the Mighty, by Ernest K. Gann: When a four-engine plane loses an engine over the Pacific Ocean, what had been an uneventful trip becomes a white-knuckle race for survival.\"Corey Ford Buys the Farm,\" from Flight of the Intruder, by Stephen Coonts: During the Vietnam Conflict, pilots took lightly armed A-6 Intruders on harrowing near-suicide missions against the North Vietnamese army.  Here, the master of the military thriller takes you along for the ride inside the cockpit as three Intruders head out to destroy some Russian MiG fighters grounded in Laos.\"Power River MOA,\" from The Sky Masters, by Dale Brown: At the Powder River weapons-testing site, the jet fighters may fire blanks, but the air combat simulations are as real as can be.  Strap yourself in for a ride in the latest in bomber technology-the EB-52 Megafortress.\"Retaliation,\" from The War in 2020, by Ralph Peters: In the near future, America is threatened by a joint Iran-Japan military force that threatens the Middle East and Europe.  Saddle up with the high-tech, hard-hitting cavalry soldiers of the future and their armored, fire-breathing future flying machines as they take to the air to raid on an enemy base.With an introduction and story notes written by Stephen Coonts, On Glorious Wings is a must-have for any aviation enthusiast.",

They are highly mystical and at the same time highly honest; as W. H. Auden wrote, \"...what is astonishing about the sonnets, especially when one remembers the age in which they were written, is the impression they make of naked autobiographical confession.\" Because they are witty, passionate, personal, and often ever bawdy, The Sonnets stand as one of the greatest poetic tributes ever written to a beloved. Elegantly presented in deluxe edition, these 154 beautiful poems are the perfect gift for any man or woman who has ever been in love.",

In Questions and Answers on Conversations with God, Neale, with characteristic wit and wisdom, responds to the most compelling and provocative of these letters; and the result is a book that is profoundly enlightening and inspiring. By relating the messages in the dialogues of CWG to the personal issues and everyday experience of individuals, Neale's answers illustrate the direct link between spiritual and physical reality, clearly demonstrating how what we do and who we are in our lives is a result of how we think and what we believe. This book gives us all the opportunity to look at ourselves, to change ourselves, and thus, perhaps, to change the world.",
