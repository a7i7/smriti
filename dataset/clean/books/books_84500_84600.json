The program never got off the ground, however, despite how passionate a woman named Alexandra Cantrell, daughter of a notorious Mafia don, and her husband, Joshua, had been about it. Still uninhabited twelve years later, the house remains as a strange monument to dangerous secrets, falling into ruin as the forest grows up around it.While the couple's abrupt exit was unusual, it was also not regarded as suspicious--until the bones of Alexandra's husband are found buried in the woods.Private investigator Lincoln Perry isn't thrilled about the situation, or his client: Parker Harrison served fifteen years for murder but claims Alexandra's intervention saved his life. Now he wants to find her--and he's not the only one.What seems at first like the simplest of jobs proves to be an undertaking that will challenge both Perry's abilities as a detective and his commitment to that calling. With a new partner to train and a case that leads straight to the heart of the Cleveland organized crime scene, Perry finds himself glancing over his shoulder at every turn, pushing the bounds of safety even as he backs away.Once again Michael Koryta has crafted an intricate, lightning-paced thriller, ratcheting up the tension as he explores just how dangerous the offer of a second chance can be. The latest installment in the Lincoln Perry series, which the Chicago Tribune calls \"addictively readable,\" marks another step forward in his incredible career.",

Each striking illustration, painted on hand-carved replicas of these signs, introduces readers to the people, places and events that gave birth to our nation. Beginning with the Stamp Act that angered the patriots and inspired the \"Sons of Liberty\" to protest, readers meet George Washington (who gave his farewell speech to his soldiers at Fraunces Tavern), Thomas Jefferson (who penned the first draft of the Declaration of Independence at a Philadelphia tavern) and other historical figures, and learn about the documents and battles that keep the fight for freedom alive.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Book of British Political Anecdotes",

        "Description": "Renowned journalist and bestselling author, Paul Johnson here presents over three hundred anecdotes about the world of British politics from Richard III's murder of the princes in the Tower of London to a final frosty scene between Jim Callaghan and Barbara Castle.      The stories range from the sublime to the ridiculous, from the witty to the sobering, the gratifying to the positively alarming.  The volume contains Lloyd George's assessment of Churchill: \"He would make a drum out of the skin of his mother in order to sound his own praises;\" an account of Henry VIII's tireless rewriting of his secretaries' work, drafts for which he required two-and-a-half inch margins and inch-wide spaces between lines to leave room for his changes;  the details of Queen Mary II's brave death from smallpox;  and much more. Journals, letters, and parliamentary records written by contemporaries, as well as later biographies record the brilliance and flaws of such notorious statesmen and politicians as Sir Thomas More, Cromwell, Sir Robert Walpole, Gladstone, Disraeli, and Attlee.  Offering new perspectives on British history, the volume reveals endlessly entertaining stories of funerals, battles in parliament, an interview with a journalist turned forger, dinner and garden parties, the visit of a lecherous former American president, Attlee's reaction to being overtaken by a dangerous driver who proves to be his wife, and more.      Johnson convincingly demonstrates in his introduction that anecdotes consistently provide a valuable source of historical truth.  Moreover, we remember the stories--strange, eccentric, personal--long after forgetting the dates of battles and monarchs.",

Only a small minority of the affluent are truly living the American Dream, complete with attractive, job-rich suburbs, reasonably low taxes, good public schools, and little violent crime. For the remaining majority of Americans, segregation comes with stratospheric costs. In a society that sets up \"winner\" and \"loser\" communities and schools defined by race and class, racial minorities in particular are locked out of the \"winner\" column. African-Americans bear the heaviest burden. But with the expensive price tag attached to \"winner\" communities, middle-income whites also struggle to afford homes in good neighborhoods with acceptable schools.",

Like most Americans, stay-at-home moms Chrissy Pate and Kristin McKee spent the lion's share of their budgets on what they assumed to be static costs such as groceries and utilities. But when using traditional couponing and cheapskate guides didn't help their budgets shrink by a dime, Pate and McKee decided to come up with their own way to save.Within a few months, their household expenses dropped by more than half-from spending $800 each per month to less than $350! only a few years after developing their \"be centsable\" system, Pate and McKee have helped thousands of subscribers save money without spending hours finding and cutting coupons, or giving up \"extras\" like travel and entertainment. In this prescriptive guide, these authors show how anyone can save thousands of dollars on cleaning supplies, pet care, toys, travel, and most importantly, groceries-without giving up healthy foods, favorite products, or the occasional splurge.",

Jenny helps Miss Shaw open up to the community around her, while Miss Shaw teaches Jenny to meet even life's most painful challenges with confidence and faith. This unexpected relationship transforms both characters in ways neither could have anticipated, and the ripple effect that begins in the summer of the penny goes on to bring new life to the people around them, showing how God works in the smallest details.

        "Authors": "By Borg, Marcus J. (EDT), Oregon State University (COR), and Trinity Institute (COR)",
        "Description": "On February 9-10, 1996, six internationally known Jesus scholars participated in the first national symposium to commemorate the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus. Talking about the historical, religious, and cultural significance of Jesus, these scholars drew mass media attention and inspired a phenomenally successful follow-up discussion group on the Internet. Jesus at 2000 makes the symposium available to those seeking an introduction to the controversial historical study of Jesus and Christian origins and to those wishing to examine the intricacies of this New Testament scholarship more carefully.In addition to the papers presented by Marcus J. Borg, John Dominic Crossan, Alan F. Segal, Harvey Cox, Karen Jo Torjesen, and Huston Smith, this book includes questions from the symposium as well as a concluding chapter that introduces the historical study of Jesus and Christian origins to the newly curious. Readers will appreciate the wide range of perspectives offered, from historical Jesus scholarship to Jewish studies, early Christian history, world religions, and religion and culture. Written for a general audience, the book will be useful in both academic and church settings for those wanting to know what the academy is saying about Jesus.",
