Which ones work well and which do not? What should you look for? This book tackles Spotlight, an enhanced search feature that helps you find anything on your computer; iChat AV for videoconferencing; Automator for automating repetitive, manual or batch tasks; and  the hundreds of smaller tweaks and changes, good and bad, that Apple's marketing never bothers to mention.Mac OS X: The Missing Manual, Tiger Edition is the authoritative book that's ideal for every user, including people coming to the Mac for the first time. Our guide offers an ideal introduction that demystifies the Dock, the unfamiliar Mac OS X folder structure, and the entirely new Mail application.

And plenty more: learn to configure Mac OS X using the System Preferences application, keep your Mac secure with FileVault, and learn about Tiger's enhanced Firewall capabilities. If you're so inclined, this Missing Manual also offers an easy introduction to the Terminal application for issuing basic Unix commands. There's something new on practically every page, and David Pogue brings his celebrated wit and expertise to every one of them. Mac's brought a new cat to town and we have a great new way to tame it.",

We attend a truly French marathon, where the beverage of choice is Ch\u00e2teau Lafite-Rothschild rather than Gatorade. We search out the most pungent cheese in France, and eavesdrop on a heated debate on the perfect way to prepare an omelet. We even attend a Catholic mass in the village of Richerenches, a sacred event at which thanks are given for the aromatic, mysterious, and breathtakingly expensive black truffle.

They raise their own food, make their own clothes, dispense justice when necessary, and care for an ever-increasing number of children. They've even found themselves in a position to help the survivors of Earth and Barevi, worlds battered by Catteni raids until natural resources are in desperately short supply. To a hungry man on Earth, a roasted Botany \"rock-squat\" makes a fine meal, no matter how funny-looking he might once have found that little bird.But Botany can't provide everything. Solar cells, communications equipment, spare tires, even the simplest battery - all of this technology is required if this is to become a fully functioning world, and none of it is easy to make. Kris Bjornson and her beloved Zainal know that the warehouses of Barevi are full of the things they need, all looted from Earth during the war. But the Barevi merchants won't just give it back; some kind of interstellar trade must be developed.The oddest commodities turn out to be the ones that work. For some reason the fierce Catteni become easily addicted to a good cup of coffee, and are prepared to do a great deal to get it. And, the colonists discover, the Catteni have their own kinds of vanity - which like all vanities can be catered to at a high price. Quick thinking and the willingness to do whatever it takes are the colonists' tactics, as they work to position their little world as an equal partner among the interstellar powers.",

        "Description": "Many thousands of readers shared the joy of The Dog Who Rescues Cats, the amazing true story of Philip Gonzalez and his miracle dog, Ginny. Millions more watched their story on television news and talk shows. Since their first book, Philip and Ginny have been hard at work, carrying out their most incredible rescues - and their lives have changed in wonderful ways. The Blessing of the Animals is the story of their remarkable successes, from the back alleys of their Long Island cat-feeding stations to the backstage corridors of the Sally Jessy Raphael show. Philip and Ginny have become the world's most popular cat-rescue team.When Philip adopted Ginny from a local animal shelter, he knew right away that she was no ordinary dog. Ginny's amazing sixth sense enabled her to sniff out abandoned and disabled cats, and before long Philip had devoted his life to rescuing and caring for cats in need. Today they feed over one hundred outdoor cats and have brought twenty into their own home; one is blind, one is deaf, one has no rear paws, but they are all part of the family. Since The Dog Who Rescues Cats, Philip and Ginny's rescues have grown even more heroic. There was Beige, a frightened stray stranded in a flooded lot after the blizzard of '96; two kittens plucked from the backseat of an abandoned car; and Chairman, a tiny kitten whom Ginny sniffed out in a carton full of broken glass. On national television Sally Jessy Raphael called Ginny \"a true hero\" and gave her a medal. One TV reporter said, \"She's the Pied Piper of sick and disabled cats,\" and another noted, \"You might call her the Mother Teresa of the cat world.\" The Blessing of the Animals is the second volume in a heartwarming, remarkable story.",

His wide-ranging commentary accompanying each work, from Mondrian's pulsating abstractions to Brancusi's soaring sculptures and Calder's Thirteen Spines, illuminates a whole network of cultural connections, from the literary to the aesthetic to the political.Appel champions the restorative, uplifting forces found in the works of such twentieth-century artists as Matisse, Lachaise, Paul Klee, Walker Evans, Joyce, Chagall, Stravinsky, Nabokov, Russell Lee, Leger, Milhaud (some of whom came to America to escape Hitler and quickly caught the native upbeat beat) . . .Their works have often portrayed the commonplace: cars, gasoline stations, roadside diners, electric signs, movies, radios, skyscrapers . . . celebrating - even through war in Europe and depression at home - the advances in technology, the new look of the cities . . .Appel discusses how their art stimulates and quickens the pulse, and how - with its folk images of the new, willed \"primitivism,\" in part inspired by the tribal art of Africa and Oceania - it projects optimism, humor, energy.Full of ideas and brilliant critical insights, this is a book at once idiosyncratic, authoritative, and fun to look at and to read.",

On a sunny day in Hollywood,  a gleaming Rolls-Royce convertible pulls through the gates of the magnificent estate  known as The Cottage. Modeled after the \u201ccottages\u201d of Newport, Rhode Island, the  spacious, elegant property, sitting on fourteen acres of lush Bel Air, fits its owner  to a T. For the man behind the wheel of the Rolls is Hollywood\u2019s ageless wonder,  Cooper Winslow. A star of the silver screen for decades, a man whose allure to women  is the stuff of legend, Coop exudes grace, charm, and old-fashioned style. But today  Coop Winslow is in for a major surprise. He\u2019s broke. And with no major roles coming  his way, Coop is faced with the heartbreaking prospect of selling his beloved home  of forty years, or at least renting out the gatehouse and part of the main house.  A huge blow to Coop, whose debonair attitude allows him to escape reality much of  the time.   His new tenants, Mark Friedman and Jimmy O\u2019Connor, are busy coping with  problems of their own. Mark\u2019s wife of sixteen years just walked out, and Jimmy recently  lost his own wife to a devastating illness. But everything changes when Mark\u2019s teenage  son and daughter move in. Suddenly, The Cottage is transformed, with music blasting  from every corner, teenagers on skateboards crashing into vintage cars, and a never-ending  parade of young starlets streaming in and out to visit Coop.   But amid all the noise  and the chaos, something unexpected is happening.  Three men who never would have  met are becoming friends...and each man finds himself changing in surprising ways,  Coop most of all. Because beneath the dazzle and flash, the impeccably tailored suits  and the sheer bravado, is a man trying to keep control of his carefully ordered world\u2014a  world that is becoming more and more unpredictable with each passing day.   First,  a tabloid scandal erupts, threatening Coop\u2019s budding romance with a wealthy debutante....A  stranger approaches Coop with stunning news....A devastating accident almost claims  the life of one of the housemates....And in the midst of it all, The Cottage welcomes  a new houseguest with a secret of her own, who will change Coop\u2019s life in unexpected  ways.  Because among the people who share his cottage and his life, Coop Winslow\u2013 loner, bachelor, movie star\u2013may find the rarest of all opportunities: a chance to  build a happiness he could never have dreamed of on his own, and to become the kind  of human being he has never been.   Against a glittering backdrop of celebrity and  glamour, Danielle Steel digs deeper to tell a story of friendship and love, tragedy  and second chances...of the choices and unexpected turns of fate that can shape characters  and lives.",
