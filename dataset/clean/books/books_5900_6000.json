Neither Grady nor Julia can guess that their long journey has become intertwined with a bloody incident carried out decades before.Off the coast of Burma a remarkable discovery was made. Two Japanese amas - women pearl divers - retrieved a handful of unheard-of blue pearls, 18 millimeters in diameter. As a reward, they were savagely murdered by the ship's captain, whose only regret was that one person - the young Amerasian son of one of the divers - escaped the massacre.In Thailand Grady and Julia come upon a gifted gem cutter and an odd series of events drive them closer to their fate and a fearful day of reckoning. For just beyond the last step in their quest lies the blue waters of the Andaman, and within them, waiting to be uncovered, the truth surrounding a bed of oysters guarding the most extraordinary blue pearls...From the lore of precious minerals, shark charmers, and cut-throat businessmen to the exotic legends of the Far East, 18mm Blues is an unforgettable odyssey woven with passion, beauty, destiny, and dreams - a story elegantly spun by today's most original bestselling novelist.",

Then, in a split second in Dallas, she lost it all.Just Jackie: Her Private Years is the story of a woman who struggles to recapture her old life with all its power and glory, only to discover that the key to her happiness lies where she least expects it - in the simple pleasures of family, friendship, work, and nature.For this myth-shattering portrait, Klein has amassed a wealth of exclusive information from private documents and correspondence, FBI files, and hundreds of interviews with Jackie's friends, the associates of Aristotle Onassis, and people familiar with her longtime companion, the mysterious diamond merchant Maurice Templesman.Much more than a portrait of a famous celebrity. Klein's journalistic tour de force captures the essence of a captivating woman, whose passion for wealth was matched only by her deep need for privacy.

Stubbornly, Heather is determined to infiltrate the manor's defenses, and she is shocked to discover part of Troytan's famous garden overgrown with a thicket of thorns that seems almost malevolent in its resistance to her intrusion. After she braves the wall of briars and reaches the Victorian manor house beyond, she senses a strange miasma of evil lurking, tainting its peaceful beauty.For reasons Heather cannot comprehend, the reclusive owner seems all too pleased to meet her, but his enthusiasm rings false. Heather begins to wonder whether it is only stories of long-vanished witchcraft that haunt Troytan House and the village beyond or whether there is some more modern evil nearer at hand and far, far more dangerous.",

        "Description": "What if you were loved more than you know?  Mark Bryan's work is bringing families together. He was a member of Oprah Winfrey's 1999 \"Change Your Life\" team and a regular on her show, where he reunites parents and children. Now, counselor, educator, and cofounder of The Artist's Way Workshops, Mark Bryan offers a book that will help all of us get closer to our family members and achieve deeper intimacy by cracking the  Codes of Love  As a counselor, Bryan reconnects parents and grown children despite the pain, bitterness, and anger when the work begins. In helping families find buried closeness, Bryan has learned many lessons about what it takes to open people's hearts. He shares these lessons here -- as well as his own family story, which he weaves throughout the book, a story that poignantly illustrates how reconnection is more than possible, even after years of separation.  Bryan's key insight is that families often communicate love in code, using words, actions, and behaviors that not only may obscure love but sometimes get interpreted as love's opposite. Messages of affection, caring, and concern may be sent in ways that other family members read as negative judgments, efforts to control and undermine. Gaps in communication cause the messages to get lost or distorted in transit. These gaps result from generational and life differences, contrasting emotional and conversational styles, \"interference\" from a legacy of past conflicts, and other factors. If you can decode your family's messages of love and affection, from the past and from today, you can open the door to richer family ties.  Codes of Love is a guidebook that offers the basic tools for creating better relationships with parents, siblings, grown sons and daughters, spouses, even old friends -- all the loved ones in your life. Bryan explores why family affection so often gets buried or forgotten, then shows us how to recover warmth and rebuild family bonds. He gives readers the necessary tools to crack the codes of love in their own families and discover intimate connections they may not have known existed.  What if you can love more than you know?",

This is the book that dares to ask the question: Who is this man's ideal bride?Michael Anstruther-Wetherby is a rising member of Parliament -- a man destined for power. Aristocratic, elegant, and effortlessly charming, he is just arrogant enough to capture the interest of the ladies of the ton. And with his connections to the wealthy and influential Cynster family -- his sister is married to Devil Cynster, the Duke of St. Ives -- his future appears assured. Except that Michael lacks the single most important element of success: a wife. Political pressure sends him searching for his ideal bride, a gently bred, malleable young lady, preferably one with a political background. Michael discovers such a paragon but finds a formidable obstacle in his path -- the young lady's beautiful, strong-minded aunt -- Caroline Sutcliffe.One of London's foremost diplomatic hostesses, Caro has style and status but, having lived through an unhappy political marriage, wants nothing of the sort for her niece, who has already lost her heart to another.So Caro and the younger woman hatch a plot -- Caro will demonstrate why an inexperienced young lady is not the bride for Michael. She succeeds in convincing him that what he really needs is a lady of experience by his side.And the perfect candidate is right under his nose -- Caro herself. Then it is Michael's turn to be persuasive, a task that requires every ounce of his seductive charm as he tempts and tantalizes Caro, seeking to convince her that becoming his bride will bring her all her heart desires . . . and more.But then a series of mysterious, and dangerous, accidents befall Caro -- an assailant has stepped in with their own idea for Caro's future -- one that could involve murder.

Inside is an ornate album filled with gruesome crime scene photos\u2014a homicide scrapbook entitled The Murder Book. Alex can find no reason for anyone to send him this compendium of death, but when Milo views the book, he is immediately shaken by one of the images: a young woman, tortured, strangled, and dumped near a freeway ramp.This was one of Milo\u2019s first cases as a rookie homicide cop: a vicious killing that he failed to solve, because just as he and his training partner began to make headway, the department closed them down. Being forced to abandon the young victim tormented Milo. But his fears prevented him from pursuing the truth, and over the years he managed to forget. Or so he thought.Now, two decades later, someone has chosen to stir up the past. As Alex and Milo set out to uncover what really happened twenty years ago, their every move is followed and their lives are placed in jeopardy. The relentless investigation reaches deep into L.A.\u2019s nerve-centers of power and wealth\u2014past and present. While peeling back layer after layer of ugly secrets, they discover that the murder of one forgotten girl has chilling ramifications that extend far beyond the tragic loss of a single life.A classic story of good and evil, sacrifice and sin, The Murder Book is a gripping page-turner that illuminates the darkest corridors of the human mind. It is a stunning tour de force.",

Bejesus, isn't America a great and wonderful country?\" His older brother Frank's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, Angela's Ashes, took its somber tone from the bleak atmosphere of those slums, while Malachy's boisterous recollections are fueled by his zestful appreciation for the opportunities and oddities of his native land. He and Frank were born in Brooklyn, moved with their parents to Ireland as children, then returned to the States as adults. This book covers the decade 1952-63, when Malachy roistered across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, but spent most of his time in New York City. There his ready wit and quick tongue won him an acting job with the Irish Players, a semiregular stint on The Tonight Show hosted by Jack Paar, and friendships with some well-heeled, well-born types who shared his fondness for saloon life and bankrolled him in an East Side saloon that may have been the first singles bar. He chronicles those events--and many others--with back-slapping bonhomie. Although McCourt acknowledges the personal demons that pursued him from his poverty-stricken childhood and destroyed his first marriage, this is on the whole an exuberant autobiography that pays tribute to the joys of a freewheeling life.",

Tracing the chronology of what happened when a number of women across the country recognized the extent to which HIV/AIDS was endangering women and attempted to do something about it, Gena Corea exposes once and for all the \"invisible\" nature of women's place in the AIDS crisis and confronts the inaccuracies behind the many long-held assumptions of the primarily male medical community, the media, and the often misinformed general public.From the first cases of young women dying of \"pneumonia\" in the early 1980s, to widespread denial of the threat of AIDS to women in ensuing years, to the disturbing discoveries of the recent past, The Invisible Epidemic makes clear that the historical precedent for inadequate research into women's health concerns has prevented any intelligent assessment of women's risk or models for women's care and treatment.Ultimately, The Invisible Epidemic brings sharply into focus the extent to which AIDS has become not just a health issue, but a much larger social issue that threatens all of us.",

        "Title": "The Contender: Richard Nixon:  The Congress Years, 1946 to 1952",
        "Authors": "By Gellman, Irwin F.",
        "Description": "At long last the true Richard Nixon can be revealed. The man known as \"Tricky Dick,\" who is seen today as the greatest villain in the history of American politics, actually began his amazing career as a principled campaigner and a scrupulously honest member of Congress.  Sadly, the first real reassessment of Richard Nixon's early career -- his Congress years -- had to wait until after his death in 1994. Only then was Pulitzer Prize-nominee Irwin F. Gellman able to getthe documentary access of which previous Nixon biographers could only dream. Gellman became the first historian to have complete and unfettered access to (among other sources) the 1946, 1948, and 1950 campaign files in the National Archives; papers from the executive sessions of HUAC; and every document dated through July 1952 in the Nixon Library & Birthplace. All told, Gellman scoured millions of pages in dozens of collections, the vast majority of which have never before been used.  Gellman's research revealed that much of the work done on Nixon was not only based on incomplete information but was wrong. The legend of \"Tricky Dick\" was little more than a series of myths. For example: The \"Committee of 100\" did not buy Nixon his 1946 upset of Jerry Voorhis. Nixon did not unfairly smear Helen Gahagan Douglas. There was no secret funding of his Senate race in 1950. Nixon did not out-McCarthy McCarthy on HUAC. And finally, Nixon was true to Earl Warren at the 1952 convention -- there was no secret deal made for the vice presidency. As Gellman irrefutably shows, each of these myths has been built on guesswork or faulty sources.  Who then was the real Richard Nixon? Other historians have given us ominous hints and vague charges of financial and moral misconduct. Gellman shows otherwise, and the proof is in the details. In 1946 Nixon used his own meager savings in a shoestring campaign. In 1950, operating with a budget in the low six-figures -- high for the time, but many times lower than other estimates -- he reaped the benefits of his opponent's bruising primary. And the Red bashing? On HUAC Nixon was a moderate who won universal praise for his even-handedness. Behind the scenes he cautioned McCarthy against his excesses.  Even during the incredible success of Nixon's Congress years there are occasional lapses of judgment. But, as Gellman shows, it was innocence and energy -- not deceit -- that made a fresh-faced Richard Nixon the victor against great odds in contest after contest. Here are the triumphs of the early years of a young man that we can unabashedly admire. Here is the rise of Richard Nixon, from nobody to vice president, that makes all previous biographies obsolete. Here is the Nixon that history will now remember.",

Outside, all is peace - but inside lies destruction: an almost superhuman violence, mirrored by a series of disappearances and deaths that have haunted the region.Paul Skoglund hasn't seen his eccentric, wealthy aunt in years. But her magnificent nineteenth-century hunting lodge has been ravaged, and she refuses to have anyone outside the family take on the repairs. Paul senses something amiss, but takes the job anyway. He's in no position to turn down work. Despite his brilliance, Paul hasn't held a steady job for years, partly because of his Tourette's syndrome, a strange neurological disorder that compels him to act out in bizarre and explosive ways. His icy ex-wife plans to use his condition to wrest away custody of their troubled young son. And in this otherwise uncertain world, Paul is sure of one thing: Nothing and no one is going to come between himself and Mark.As Paul and his lovely, risk-addicted girlfriend, Lia, delve into the lodge's wreckage, they can't help but wonder what dark passion - and what strength - could cause such chaos. Their search for answers takes them from the most ancient, primal human impulses to the cutting edge of biomedical research, from the science of genetics to Viking legends to forensic pathology - and across the ambiguous borderline between thought and reality.As the quickening events lead him deeper into his family's past, Paul must face the darker aspects of his own nature, and brave the possibility that in saving those he loves, he might well destroy himself.",

        "Title": "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter: And Other Tips from a Beleaguered Father (Not That Any of Them Work)",
        "Authors": "By Cameron, W. Bruce",
        "Description": "Fathers may suspect it's not easy for their daughters to become women, but those same daughters have no idea how hard it is for fathers to stand by and watch. According to W. Bruce Cameron, \"Having a child mutate into a teenager is a bit like being an airline passenger who must suddenly take over for a stricken pilot and land the plane. And in this case, the passengers are all yelling, 'I hate you! I hate you!' and slamming the door to the cockpit.\"  Cameron has two daughters, so he is doubly aware that raising teenage girls is well, impossible. He's been through braces (the most expensive metal on earth), kissing (do they have to use their lips?), teen \"logic\" (\"I asked if I could go out with Lindsey and you said no, so I went out with Courtney\"), and, of course, dating, which leads to the 8 Simple Rules. (Rule #1: if you pull into my driveway and honk, you'd better be delivering a package, because you're sure as heck not picking anything up.)  If your little girl has moved out and a teenager has taken her place, this book will help you do something you probably thought was not possible in your situation: laugh.",

        "Description": "\"Danger Zones is compulsively readable and utterly engrossing--one of those books which hooks you from page one until you reluctantly surrender it in the small hours of Saturday morning.\"--The Times (London)The danger zones--where sex, secrets, and sin collide--are the places that New York Times bestselling author Sally Beauman knows best . . . and explores with gripping, brilliant intensity in her new novel. In the picture-perfect English Cotswolds, two teenage girls dressed in punk finery attend a wild midnight party. Music, drugs, and dancing are promised by the enigmatic young man known only as Star. Charismatic and cunning, a conjurer who procures heaven for a price, Star sells seduction for a living. Now he's got a pill--a White Dove--that delivers the ultimate high. And he has a plan. By dawn, one girl will be dead, the other will have vanished--swept by Star into the danger zone.At the heart of that perilous place stands the gifted and reclusive Maria Cazar\u00e8s, a couturier of originality and passion, a woman who shuns her own fame, a legend shrouded in mystery. Around her swirls rumor and counterrumor, whispers of shocking secrets and taboos broken. Fiercely shielded from celebrity's glare by Jean Lazare, her iron-willed partner--some say lover--Cazar\u00e8s is surrounded only by a carefully selected few.And the most dangerous among them is Star.Now, as the glitterati assemble in Paris for the new collections, a fatal triangle established three decades before in sultry New Orleans is about to fulfill its tragic destiny. Two journalists, firebrand editor Rowland McGuire and investigative reporter Gini Hunter, pick up the heady scent of an unfolding scandal. And as they clash over how to cover it, their hostility ignites a sudden desperate flame of desire--a desire that, if quenched, will tilt their universe.Against the pounding beat and dazzling colors on the runway as the world waits breathless for the new Cazar\u00e8s collection, the search for a missing innocent will reach its pulsingly suspenseful climax. At last, blood red truths will be revealed . . . as the author of Destiny sweeps us into the Danger Zones, where no heart is safe.",
