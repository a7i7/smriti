Authors Jennifer Lin and Susan Warner have interviewed women of all ages from all walks of life and all parts of the country. All of their subjects have one thing in common: Running has transformed them. There are both heartrending stories of grief and survival and lighthearted tales of friendship. Among them are:* Sisters who competed in a 5K race to honor a sister who survived breast cancer.* A 9/11 widow who ran her first marathon to honor the memory of her husband. * A 65-year-old woman who overcame obesity and alcoholism to finish the grueling Ironman triathlon.* An unknown runner from Norway named Grete Waitz who decided to run a marathon-and changed the face of the sport.Sole Sisters: Stories of Women and Running is not just for women who run. It appeals to all women who know what it means to have the support of others who share their trials and triumphs.

        "Description": "Would you like to end temper tantrums, sibling rivalry, and other unacceptable behavior without resorting to threats, shouting, or spanking?Let Dr. Rod Kennedy show you how to become an Encouraging Parent.Remember that time when you were down on your knees, holding out your arms, and shouting out encouragement as your toddler took those first steps? When your child stumbled and fell, you didn't shout, spank, or reprimand -- you smiled, soothed, encouraged. You motivated your child to succeed. You can recapture that positive and effective attitude and harness it to raise a confident, self-disciplined, and happy child. The first step is to realize that the problem isn't how to \"fix\" your child, it's to understand how your own attitudes and beliefs get in the way of effective parenting, then learn how to fine-tune your emotional and communication skills.Based on his popular workshops, which have trained more than 100,000 parents, Dr. Kennedy's book contains a wealth of practical information on how to teach kids self-discipline. Topics include:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00b8\u00a0\u00a0A self-test to help pinpoint where you need to refine your parenting skills\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00b8\u00a0\u00a0Establishing daily routines that are easy to remember-- and that will end the chaos\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00b8\u00a0\u00a0Teaching kids to get along and resolve their own conflicts so you don't have to micromanage\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00b8\u00a0\u00a0Real-life parenting lessons from the parents who attend Dr. Kennedy's workshopsThis warm, empathetic, and practical guide will help you nurture your child's positive development and create the loving, supportive atmosphere all kids need to thrive.",

Timmie may look like an outsider in this backwater town, but she's actually come home again after a bad marriage and an exhausting stint at a Los Angeles hospital. Timmie quickly gains her coworkers' respect for her split-second reactions on the job. Yet even Timmie is stunned when the ex-husband of one of her fellow nurses turns up in the ER with the flu and leaves in a body bag.Timmie is far away from the perilous streets of L.A., but something just as deadly is festering nearby beneath the glossy surface of Restcrest, the hospital's highly regarded senior citizen care-and-research facility - where Timmie's father is the latest patient. Restcrest patients are suddenly piling up in the hospital morgue, and old age isn't reason enough to explain these tragedies or the rash of other mysterious deaths Timmie encounters in her new job. Adding to the dangerous mix is the attempted shooting of the hospital's golden-boy administrator, enough bureaucratic red tape to wrap a full-body cast, and the fact that Timmie's the only one in the hospital who is fighting to find out the truth.In her search for answers, Timmie joins forces with Daniel Murphy, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter with a bad case of burnout and a gig at a local paper. But as their investigation promises to rocket Murphy back to the big leagues, it also threatens to suck Timmie into a chilling conspiracy of corruption and murder that could destroy her friendships, her family, and any hope she has of rebuilding her life.",

There her husband, Janusz, is already waiting for them at the little house at 22 Britannia Road. But the war has changed them all so utterly that they'll barely recognize one another when they are reunited. \"Survivor,\" she answers. Silvana and Aurek spent the war hiding in the forests of Poland. Wild, almost feral Aurek doesn't know how to tie his own shoes or sleep in a bed. Janusz is an Englishman now-determined to forget Poland, forget his own ghosts from the way, and begin a new life as a proper English family. But for Silvana, who cannot escape the painful memory of a shattering wartime act, forgetting is not a possibility. One of the most searing debuts to come along in years, 22 Britannia Road. is the wrenching chronicle of how these damaged people try to become, once again, a true family. An unforgettable novel that cries out for discussion, it is a powerful story of primal maternal love, overcoming hardship, and, ultimately, acceptance-one that will pierce your heart.",

The girls were so moved by Olivia's story that they initiated a letter-writing campaign to help lift her spirits. It was a tender gesture of solidarity that set off an overwhelming chain reaction of support, encouragement, and love.In Letters to a Bullied Girl, Olivia and the Buder sisters share an inspiring selection of messages that arrived from across America\u2014the personal, often painful remembrances of former targets, remorseful bullies, and sympathetic bystanders. Letters to a Bullied Girl examines our national bullying epidemic from a variety of angles and perspectives, and includes practical guidance from bullying expert Barbara Coloroso, author of The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander. Though addressed to Olivia, the letters speak to all young people who have been bullied, offer advice and hope to those who suffer, and provide a wake-up call to all who have ever been involved in bullying.",
