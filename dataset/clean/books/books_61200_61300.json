A secret cabal orders Harris to have the president of France and the chancellor of Germany assassinated. If the president doesn't go along with the conspiracy, he'll become the cabal's next target.Now he can trust no one. Fleeing for his life, pursued by the Secret Service, the CIA, and Spanish Intelligence, Harris joins forces with Nicholas Marten and the beautiful but enigmatic French photojournalist Demi Picard.

The assassination of world leaders, a genocidal attack on a major civilian populace with weapons of mass destruction - nothing is beyond them.The origin of their evil reaches back to the Renaissance when the dying political thinker Niccolo Machiavelli fashioned a sinister addendum to his most infamous work, The Prince. Titled simply \"The Covenant,\" it is a terrifying blueprint for the gaining and keeping of true political power. For five hundred years this despotic order of the supremely rich and powerful has kept Machiavelli's original manuscript hidden away under heavy guard, the document itself worshiped like a divine artifact.Out manned, outnumbered, outgunned, three people now stand alone against it: Nicholas Marten, Demi Picard, and John Henry Harris, president of the United States.",

Yet she had come in order to prove to herself that she was not afraid to see him again. Her departure years before from both Logan and the small Texas town where they were sweethearts had been abrupt, painful, and not of her choosing. Worst of all, she'd never had the chance to tell Logan the truth of why she had to leave. Now she would not only have a chance to explain, but to ask him for a favor. Handsome, charming, and dangerously charismatic, Logan exudes all the power and confidence of a self-made success. He listens as Dani describes her work for a charitable foundation and expresses her hope that he will donate one of his properties for a much-needed summer camp. Logan agrees, but with one shocking proviso: that Dani fulfill the intimate promise she made to him years ago. It is meant to be a coldhearted business transaction...but this time when Dani is once again compelled to leave without an explanation, nothing can keep Logan from following.  *RendezvousFrom the Trade Paperback edition.",

        "Title": "The New American Militarism: How Americans Are Seduced by War",
        "Authors": "By Bacevich, Andrew J.",
        "Description": "In this provocative book, Andrew Bacevich warns of a dangerous dual obsession that has taken hold of Americans, conservatives, and liberals alike.  It is a marriage of militarism and utopian ideology--of unprecedented military might wed to a blind faith in the universality of American values. This mindset, the author warns, invites endless war and the ever-deepening militarization of U.S. policy.  It promises not to perfect but to pervert American ideals and to accelerate the hollowing out of American democracy.  As it alienates others, it will leave the United States increasingly isolated.  It will end in bankruptcy, moral as well as economic, and in abject failure.With The New American Militarism, which has been updated with a new Afterword, Bacevich examines the origins and implications of this misguided enterprise.  He shows how American militarism emerged as a reaction to the Vietnam War.  Various groups in American society--soldiers, politicians on the make, intellectuals, strategists, Christian evangelicals, even purveyors of pop culture--came to see the revival of military power and the celebration of military values as the antidote to all the ills besetting the country as a consequence of Vietnam and the 1960s.  The upshot, acutely evident in the aftermath of 9/11, has been a revival of vast ambitions and certainty, this time married to a pronounced affinity for the sword.  Bacevich urges us to restore a sense of realism and a sense of proportion to U.S. policy.  He proposes, in short, to bring American purposes and American methods--especially with regard to the role of the military--back into harmony with the nation's founding ideals.",

The hazards of growing up before you\u2019re ready are uniquely revealed through words and drawings as Greg records them in his diary. In book one of this debut series, Greg is happy to have Rowley, his sidekick, along for the ride. But when Rowley\u2019s star starts to rise, Greg tries to use his best friend\u2019s newfound popularity to his own advantage, kicking off a chain of events that will test their friendship in hilarious fashion. Author/illustrator Jeff Kinney recalls the growing pains of school life and introduces a new kind of hero who epitomizes the challenges of being a kid. As Greg says in his diary, \u201cJust don\u2019t expect me to be all \u2018Dear Diary\u2019 this and \u2018Dear Diary\u2019 that.\u201d Luckily for us, what Greg Heffley says he won\u2019t do and what he actually does are two very different things. Since its launch in May 2004 on Funbrain.com, the Web version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid has been viewed by 20 million unique online readers. This year, it is averaging 70,000 readers a day.\u00a0F&P level: T",

        "Description": "The highly anticipated third book in the critically acclaimed and bestselling series takes the art of being wimpy to a whole new level. \u00a0Let\u2019s face it: Greg Heffley will never change his wimpy ways. Somebody just needs to explain that to Greg\u2019s father. You see, Frank Heffley actually thinks he can get his son to toughen up, and he enlists Greg in organized sports and other \u201cmanly\u201d endeavors. Of course, Greg is able to easily sidestep his father\u2019s efforts to change him. But when Greg\u2019s dad threatens to send him to military academy, Greg realizes he has to shape up . . . or get shipped out.\u00a0Greg and his family and friends, who make the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books a must-read for middle school readers, are back and at their best in this hilarious new installment of the series, which is sure to please current fans while attracting new ones.\u00a0Publishers Weekly-1/19/2009:The third book in this genre-busting series is certain to enlarge Kinney\u2019s presence on the bestseller lists, where the previous titles have taken up residence for the past two years. Kinney\u2019s spot-on humor and winning formula of deadpan text set against cartoons are back in full force. This time, Greg starts off on New Year\u2019s Day (he resolves to \u201chelp other people improve,\u201d telling his mother, \u201cI think you should work on chewing your potato chips more quietly\u201d) and ends with summer vacation. As he fends off his father\u2019s attempts to make him more of a man (the threat of military school looms), Greg\u2019s hapless adventures include handing out anonymous valentines expressing his true feelings (\u201cDear James, You smell\u201d), attempting to impress his classmate Holly and single-handedly wrecking his soccer team\u2019s perfect season. Kinney allows himself some insider humor as well, with Greg noting the \u201cracket\u201d children\u2019s book authors have going. \u201cAll you have to do is make up a character with a snappy name, and then make sure the character learns a lesson at the end of the book.\u201d Greg, self-centered as ever, may be the exception proving that rule.
