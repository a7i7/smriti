        "Authors": "By Petre, Peter and Watson, Thomas J.",
        "Description": "In this eloquent first-person account of a family drama that changed the face of American business, the man who transformed IBM into the world's largest computer company reflects on his lifelong partnership with his father--and how their management style and shared dedication to excellence united to create a unique corporate culture that became the blueprint for the entire technology boom.In the course of sixty years Thomas J. Watson Sr. and his son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., together built the international colossus that is IBM. This is their story: a riveting and revealing account of two men who loved each other--and fought each other--with a terrible fierceness.But along with the story of a father and son, this is IBM's story too. It chronicles the management insights that shaped its course and its unique corporate culture, the style that made Thomas Watson Sr. one of America's most charismatic bosses, and the daring decisions by Thomas Watson Jr. that transformed IBM into the world's largest computing company. One of the greatest business-success stories of all time, Father, Son & Co. is a moving lesson for fathers who dream for their children, as well as a testament to American ingenuity and values, told in a disarmingly frank and eloquent voice.Promising to remain an important business reference as we move into the next century, FATHER, SON & CO. takes a look at the management insight that helped to shape IBM's course and unique corporate culture.  It looks at Watson, Sr., one of America's most charismatic bosses, and Watson, Jr., who spurred IBM into the computer age.Ten years after its original publication, FATHER, SON & CO. remains a uniquely honest book. Watson's willingness to write about the loving but ferociously combative relationship he had with his father and the turbulent battles behind some of IBM's most far-reaching decisions gives readers rare insights into the realities of leadership. -->",

        "Description": "Beautifully written, wonderfully observed, anddeeply felt, Ann Darby's haunting first novelmarks the debut of an important voicein women's fiction.The Orphan Game tells the story of a young woman's passage from the troubled family she's longing to escape to the \"family\" she struggles to create when she is forced into an early adulthood.As the war in Vietnam escalates and as brush fires are blackening the California foothills, the Harris family shatters and its members are driven to find new ways to live with one another. With an intimacy immediate and true, The Orphan Game portrays the powerful love that not only can bind a family, but can also break it apart.Set in a quiet Southern California town in 1965, a town where the rules of the fifties haven't quite departed and the new mores of the sixties are fast encroaching, this rueful tale is told in the intertwined voices of three women: Maggie, the young woman struggling to define herself; Marian, the mother who must relinquish her; and Mrs. Rumsen, the childless great-aunt who cares for Maggie when her mother can't. As each woman tells her tale, it becomes clear that each has, in her own way, played the orphan game--taken the risk to leave home, to claim her life, and, above all, to be loved.",

Nonetheless, AMHF research has resulted in invaluable findings, which separate valid approaches from unsustained theorising and pseudoscientific pretence.

Sorely wounded and fatally disillusioned in the fighting at Petersburg, Inman, a Confederate soldier, decides to walk back to his home in the Blue Ridge mountains and to Ada, the woman he loved there years before. His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign. At the same time, the intrepid Ada is trying to revive her father's derelict farm and learning to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away.As it interweaves their stories, Cold Mountain asserts itself as an authentic odyssey, hugely powerful, majestically lovely, and keenly moving.",

Delia Byrd is going back to Cayro, Georgia, to reclaim her life--and the two daughters she left behind...Told in the incantatory voice of one of America's most eloquent storytellers, Cavedweller is a sweeping novel of the human spirit, the lost and hidden recesses of the heart, and the place where violence and redemption intersect.",

Whether she's finding herself or finding a sitter, or contemplating her sex life as she rubs the hormone night cream on her face, Viorst explores the true and funny ironies all women encounter growing up in the modern world.Here is a young single girl from Irvington, NJ, leaving her parents' home for life in the big city (\"No I do not believe in free love/And yes I will be home for Sunday dinners,\" she promises). Here is the aspiring bohemian with an expensive liberal arts education, getting coffee and taking dictation, \"Hoping that someday someone will be impressed/With all I know.\" Here is that married woman, coping with motherhood (\"The tricycles are cluttering my foyer/The Pop Tart crumbs are sprinkled on my soul\") and fantasy affairs (\"I could imagine cryptic conversations, clandestine martinis...and me explaining that long kisses clog my sinuses\") and all-too-real family reunions (\"Four aunts in pain taking pills/One cousin in analysis taking notes\"). And here she is at mid-life, wondering whether a woman who used to wear a \"Ban the Bomb\" button can find happiness being a person with a set of fondue forks, a fish poacher, and a wok.Every step of the way, Viorst transforms the familiar events of daily life into poems that make you laugh with recognition.When Did I Stop Being Twenty and Other Injustices demonstrates once and for all that no one understands American women coming of age like Judith Viorst.",

        "Authors": "By Chanoff, David and Elders, M. Joycelyn",
        "Description": "The oldest of eight children, Joycelyn Elders was born Minnie Lee Jones in the tiny town of Schaal, Arkansas, in 1933. She grew up in a three-room cabin and, at age fifteen, graduated from high school as valedictorian. When she entered Philander Smith College in Little Rock, she had never seen a doctor, let alone dreamed of becoming one.Dr. Elders graduated from the University of Arkansas Medical School and then became its first black resident, its first black chief resident, and finally its first black professor. By the time of the Senate debate on her confirmation as surgeon general in August 1993, Dr. Elders had been a respected pediatric endocrinologist and medical scientist for a quarter of a century, as well as the director of Arkansas's health department under then-governor Clinton.But during Dr. Elders's tenure as surgeon general she came under fire for her controversial positions on such subjects as abortion, sex education, the distribution of condoms, and the legalization of drugs. Her passion and outspokenness enraged Republicans and often upset the Clinton administration. Now, Dr. Elders openly describes the top-level machinations that led the Clinton health insurance reform to self-destruct and eventually resulted in her own dismissal. She writes with equal candor about such intimate personal tragedies as her youngest son's drug addiction and arrest, and about the poisoned political climate in Arkansas, which has affected the lives of so many of the President's friends and appointees.",

Set in the perspective of monumental reconciliation between Christianity and Judaism, this is a portrait of John Paul II that describes him as only his closest friends know him and as no pope has ever been portrayed before. Readers will come to know the Holy Father as a man and to understand his most controversial ideas as expressions of his dramatic experience of life.",

While Catherine is an extraordinary beauty whose looks attract the most handsome and powerful men, her sister is a plain-Jane, no-nonsense gal who prefers running the company to walking the red carpet.But Jennifer's aversion to the spotlight becomes secondary after the successful launch of the Pegasus III satellite, her newest technological masterpiece.  The company needs someone to explain the revolutionary communications tool to potential clients and Jennifer is forced to make the awkward transition from playing scientist in the laboratory to playing hostess at the most lavish party in Cannes.That's where she meets Padraig, a major film star with enough Irish charm and celebrity cache to make the move to power producer.  But when he marries Jennifer, Catherine's protective instincts are triggered: is the playboy actor only after Jennifer's money and connections?  When Jennifer is almost killed in a car accident on her honeymoon, Catherine feels she must intervene in her sister's relationship.  But Jennifer begins to suspect that Catherine is jealous of the wallflower sister's new romance, and possibly of her power within the company.  Was the accident Catherine's murderous attempt to win complete control of Pegasus?  Suddenly, neither sister can trust the other in a game that has their love, fortune, and even their lives hanging in the balance.What begins as a rivalry between sisters becomes a chilling novel of psychological suspense in which one sister find herself alone on a yacht at sea, forced to defend herself from a terrifying killer in league with her sister.  But which sister?",

In the process, she feels compelled to initiate a reconciliation between her estranged sisters, Leah and Rachel, and between Leah and their father, Sam, a rabbi as charismatic in the pulpit as he is elusive to his loved ones.Leah, a brilliant English professor and unreconstructed leader of the left, is eloquent and foul-mouthed, a crusading feminist and a passionately conflicted wife and mother, who is suddenly shocked by the prospect of losing the husband she has always taken for granted.And Rachel, a sexual prodigy, domestic perfectionist, and mother of five, has papered over her losses with an athlete's discipline and a pragmatism bordering on self-sacrifice. On the cusp of the millennium, she watches her carefully constructed world crumble, but in the rubble discovers the woman she was meant to be.As Leah's and Rachel's marriages reach crisis points, Shoshanna oversees the reunion between her stubborn siblings.

        "Description": "Bestselling author William Bennett addresses the central social issue of our time\u2014the deline of the family\u2014in a book as intellectually provocative and politically controversial as his landmark The Death of Outrage.Our recent economic prosperity has masked the devastation of the American family, which is now under seige as never before. From the dramatic rise in illegitimacy, divorce, and single parenthood to the call for the recognition of gay marriages, the traditional nuclear family is being radically challenged and undermined, along with the moral and legal consensus that once supported it.Now in The Broken Hearth, William Bennett, America's foremost conservative spokesperson on matters of family values, presents a strong, well-reasoned, and informed defense of the traditional family. Interweaving history, anthropology, law, social science, and the teachings of Western religions, he argues that marriage between a man and a woman and the creation of a permanent, loving, and nurturing environment for children is a great historical achievement, one that should not be lightly abandoned in favor of more \"progressive\" arrangements. Bennett displays his ability to combine fearless conviction, acute insight, and respect for his adversaries in thorough, balanced, and enlightening discussions of single parenthood, cohabitation, gay marriage, and other trends that are undercuttingthe ideal of the family as the essential foundation of society.Looking closely at the concerns and questions that divide America, Bennett provides a powerful affirmation of family life and the values and benefits it bestows on individuals and on society as a whole.",

        "Description": "The last, defining years of the life of John F. Kennedy, Jr., as seen by an editor who worked for him at George magazine.At thirty-four, better known for his social life than his work as an assistant district attorney, John F. Kennedy, Jr., was still a man in search of his destiny. All that changed in 1995, when Kennedy launched a bold new magazine about American politics, puckishly called George. Over the next four years, Kennedy's passionate commitment to the magazine -- and to the ideals it stood for -- transformed him.One witness to this transformation was Richard Blow, an editor and writer who joined George several months before the release of its first issue. During their four years together, Blow observed his boss rise to enormous challenges -- starting a risky new business, managing the pressures that attend a high public profile, and beginning life as a married man. With Blow as our surrogate, we see the many sides of Kennedy's personality: the rebel who fearlessly takes on politicians and pundits; the gentleman who sends gracious thank-you notes to his colleagues for their wedding gifts; the vulnerable son occasionally at odds with a mythic family legacy; the leader who stays true to his vision, no matter how difficult the circumstances.Simply and sympathetically, Blow offers an affecting portrait of a complicated man at last coming into his own -- sometimes gracefully, sometimes under siege, but never without the burden of great expectations.",

        "Description": "\"What shall I do with this people?\" was Moses' exasperated question to God in Sinai, and it is posed once more in Milton Viorst's searching account of the crisis in Judaism today. Not since the destruction of the Second Temple, argues Viorst, have Jews displayed such intolerance toward one another or battled so fiercely over ideology. And these battles are not just intellectual exercises; they exact a fearsome price in today's Middle East.  Framed by the murder of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an Orthodox extremist -- an unprecedented outburst of violence among Jews -- the book examines how religious leaders through the centuries have shaped Judaism to serve their own political ends, often with disastrous consequences. Viorst vigorously critiques Orthodox Judaism's doctrines concerning territory in the Holy Land as well as on marriage, divorce, conversion, and women's rights, contending that religious law often departs from the teachings of the Torah and has, in fact, changed over time to perpetuate rabbinic power. In recent decades, he believes, the Orthodox rabbinate has grown so intransigently political that its ideas have sundered the Jewish people, challenging their identity and, perhaps, threatening their very existence.  What Shall I Do With This People? is both a meticulously researched history and a bracing commentary. Disturbed by the impact of intolerance on Jewish politics and society, Milton Viorst calls for an end to violence in the name of Judaism and offers a stirring plea for mutual understanding among what the Old Testament God called \"a stiff-necked people.\" Amid the heat and noise of the Middle East conflict, his is a lucid, compelling, and necessary voice.",

        "Description": "In this remarkable first novel, eight-year-old Cyrus Readymoney introduces us to his magical universe of movies and mischief; tennis tournaments and truant afternoons; sex and samosas; the sea and the shore. Exploring Bombay in the early 1970s, Cyrus strays from his mostly absent parents, members of the Parsi elite, into the complex world of his neighbors, including a mysterious maharani and her seductive adopted daughter. In his travels, he experiences the splendor of Hindi films and delights in all manner of mouthwatering food.  But in the course of his wanderings, Cyrus finds himself caught between the innocence and insouciance of his youth and the responsibility and worry that await him in adulthood. When his parents' marriage falls apart and his family is shattered, Cyrus is forced out of his carefree existence into a more severe reality.  With an acute ear for the nuances of Indian English and a comic appreciation of a boy's life, Ardashir Vakil creates an extraordinarily vivid tableau of India while at the same time drawing a rich portrait of adolescence and its appetites. Beach Boy is, as John Updike notes, \"a long ode to boyish hunger, and to the rich variety of stuffs that hold it at bay.\"  The winner of a Betty Trask award and a finalist for the Whitbread Prize for first fiction in England, Beach Boy has been heralded by American, British, and Indian critics alike for riding the crest of a new wave of Indian fiction that is bringing us fresh voices and novel writing.",

And so we turn to this delightful celebration of adorable honeymoon cottages, rotten first apartments, houses to remember (and forget), mortgaged mansions -- and that warm place in the heart we call home.

Here are all the paths to our dream houses...and to the lives and loves we make there. It's been said that no woman ever met a man or a house she couldn't make over, but this wise little book shows us that what we are really making over is ourselves.  With short and sweet stories exploring both the emotional importance of home and the practical dramas of houses -- their quaint charms and their mysterious plumbing -- Nesting helps each of us remember that, after all, there's no place like home.",

        "Description": "When he took office in 2001, George W. Bush inherited the strongest economy in American history. He inherited the largest federal budget surplus in American history -- and the prospect of paying off the entire national debt in just eight years. He inherited a strong dollar and sound fiscal policy. He inherited a nation whose economy was so strong that commentators who just a decade before were predicting American decline were now complaining about American dominance.  And yet, Dubya blew it. Squandered everything he'd inherited from President Clinton.  We thought if Junior was good at anything, it was inheriting things.  It's Still the Economy, Stupid is the story of how America's CEO -- our first MBA president -- has trashed our economy. It shows:  &#149; How he wasted the surplus on massive tax cuts for the hyper-rich.  &#149; How he talked down the economy for his short-term political gain, then passed an economic program that has put 1.8 million Americans out of work and cost investors $4.4 trillion.  &#149; How he abandoned his free-trade rhetoric to adopt protectionist tariffs, effectively raising taxes on consumers.  &#149; How he walked away from needed investments in education, training, and all the things that make us smarter, safer, and stronger economically.  &#149; How he plans to go on from here to cripple Social Security and to allow the privileged to avoid even more taxes.  It makes you wonder: What do they teach you at Harvard Business School?",

Each option has its own risks and repercussions, which Dr. Thomas realistically outlines, and each predicts how an organization will respond to such pressing concerns as How do we create an environment in which all employees and team members, with different backgrounds and personal professional demands, contribute to their full potential?; How do we create a truly global organization?; How can we weave acquisition/merger partners into one effective organization?; How can we enhance our ability to process diverse, complex data?; How can we meet the challenge of visionary leadership for the century to come?",

        "Description": "Piano Lessons is Noah Adams's delightful and moving chronicle of his fifty-second year--a year already filled with long, fast workdays and too little spare time--as he answers at last a lifelong call: to learn to play the piano.\u00a0\u00a0The twelve monthly chapters span from January--when after decades of growing affection for keyboard artists and artisans he finally plunges in and buys a piano--through December, when as a surprise Christmas present for his wife he dresses in a tuxedo and, in flickering candlelight, snow falling outside the windows, he attempts their favorite piece of music, a difficult third-year composition he's been struggling with in secret to get to this very moment.Among the up-tempo triumphs and unexpected setbacks, Noah Adams interweaves the rich history and folklore that surround the piano.\u00a0\u00a0And along the way, set between the ragtime rhythms and boogie-woogie beats, there are encounters with--and insights from--masters of the keyboard, from Glenn Gould and Leon Fleisher (\"I was a bit embarrassed,\" he writes; \"telling Leon Fleisher about my ambitions for piano lessons is like telling Julia Child about plans to make toast in the morning\") to Dr. John and Tori Amos.As a storyteller, Noah Adams has perfect pitch.\u00a0\u00a0In the foreground here, like a familiar melody, are the challenges of learning a complex new skill as an adult, when enthusiasm meets the necessary repetition of tedious scales at the end of a twelve-hour workday.\u00a0\u00a0Lingering in the background, like a subtle bass line, are the quiet concerns of how we spend our time and how our priorities shift as we proceed through life.\u00a0\u00a0For Piano Lessons is really an adventure story filled with obstacles to overcome and grand leaps forward, eccentric geniuses and quiet moments of pre-dawn practice, as Noah Adams travels across country and keyboard, pursuing his dream and keeping the rhythm.",

        "Title": "The Road from Coorain",
        "Authors": "By Conway, Jill Ker",
        "Description": "In a memoir that pierces and delights us, Jill Ker Conway tells the story of her astonishing journey into adulthood\u2014a journey that would ultimately span immense distances and encompass worlds, ideas, and ways of life that seem a century apart. She was seven before she ever saw another girl child. At eight, still too small to mount her horse unaided, she was galloping miles, alone, across Coorain, her parents' thirty thousand windswept, drought-haunted acres in the Australian outback, doing a \"man's job\" of helping herd the sheep because World War II had taken away the able-bodied men. She loved (and makes us see and feel) the vast unpeopled landscape, beautiful and hostile, whose uncertain weathers tormented the sheep ranchers with conflicting promises of riches and inescapable disaster. She adored (and makes us know) her large-visioned father and her strong, radiant mother, who had gone willingly with him into a pioneering life of loneliness and bone-breaking toil, who seemed miraculously to succeed in creating a warmly sheltering home in the harsh outback, and who, upon her husband's sudden death when Jill was ten, began to slide\u2014bereft of the partnership of work and love that had so utterly fulfilled her\u2014into depression and dependency. We see Jill, staggered by the loss of her father, catapulted to what seemed another planet\u2014the suburban Sydney of the 1950s and its crowded, noisy, cliquish school life. Then the heady excitement of the University, but with it a yet more demanding course of lessons\u2014Jill embracing new ideas, new possibilities, while at the same time trying to be mother to her mother and resenting it, escaping into drink, pulling herself back, striking a balance. We see her slowly gaining strength, coming into her own emotionally and intellectually and beginning the joyous love affair that gave wings to her newfound self. Worlds away from Coorain, in America, Jill Conway became a historian and the first woman president of Smith College. Her story of Coorain and the road from Coorain startles by its passion and evocative power, by its understanding of the ways in which a total, deep-rooted commitment to place\u2014or to a dream\u2014can at once liberate and imprison. It is a story of childhood as both Eden and anguish, and of growing up as a journey toward the difficult life of the free.",
