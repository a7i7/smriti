Saying yes to a marriage proposal from sexy detective Evan Paley was a leap of faith for Cally, who has been pursued by many -- and almost killed on occasion -- for her money. When her fianc\u00e9 disappears, Cally fears he's left her high and dry. Turns out she's right, but for the wrong reasons: he's been kidnapped.    Is he an accessory to a crime?    It started with a mysterious phone call that pulls Evan away from a little one-on-one time with Cally. Evan refuses to identify the caller -- a woman in distress -- which brings Cally down to earth fast. What secrets could he be keeping? Big ones, apparently: a dead body soon turns up in Evan's house, and Evan has vanished. On a heart-pounding race to find him, Cally follows a trail of clues to cold-blooded murder and deadly corruption -- and may uncover more than she bargained for about the man she thought she knew.",

        "Description": "From the most popular routines and the most ingenious physical shtick to the snappiest wisecracks and the most biting satire of the last century, MAKE 'EM LAUGH illuminates who we are as a nation by exploring what makes us laugh, and why. Authors Laurence Maslon and Michael Kantor draw on countless sources to chronicle the past century of American comedy and the geniuses who created and performed it-melding biography, American history, and a lotta laughs into an exuberant, important book.  Each of the six chapters focuses a different style or archetype of comedy, from the slapstick pratfalls of Buster Keaton and Lucille Ball through the wiseguy put-downs of Groucho Marx and Larry David, to the incendiary bombshells of Mae West and Richard Pryor . And at every turn the significance of these comedians-smashing social boundaries, challenging the definition of good taste, speaking the truth to the powerful-is vividly tangible. MAKE 'EM LAUGH is more than a compendium of American comic genius; it is a window onto the way comedy both reflects the world and changes it-one laugh at a time.  Starting from the groundbreaking PBS series, the authors have gone deeper into the works and lives of America's great comic artists, with biographical portraits, archival materials, cultural overviews, and rare photos.  Brilliantly illustrated, with insights (and jokes) from comedians, writers and producers, along with film, radio, television, and theater historians, MAKE 'EM LAUGH is an indispensible, definitive book about comedy in America.",

In this classic book, which was the first full discussion of sexual selection since 1871, leading biologists bring modern genetic theory and behavior observation to bear on this subject. The distinguished authors consider many aspects of sexual selection in many species, including man, within the context of contemporary evolutionary theory and research.",

        "Description": "The King and I is the story of the thirty-six-year long business relationship between Luciano Pavarotti and his manager, Herbert Breslin, during which Breslin guided what he calls, justifiably, \"the greatest career in classical music.\" During that career, Breslin moved Pavarotti out of the opera house and onto the concert (and the world) stage and into the arms of a huge mass public. How he and Pavarotti changed the landscape of opera is one of the most significant and entertaining stories in the history of classical music, and Herbert Breslin relates the tale in a brash, candid, witty fashion that is often bitingly frank and profane. He also provides a portrait of his friend and client - \"a beautiful, simple, lovely guy who turned into a very determined, aggressive, and somewhat unhappy superstar\" - that is by turns affectionate and satirical and full of hilarious details and tales out of school with Pavarotti emerging as something like the ultimate Italian male. The book is also enlivened by the voices of other players in the soap opera drama that was Pavarotti's career, and they are no less uncensored than Herbert Breslin. The last word, in fact, comes from none other than Luciano Pavarotti himself!",

The approach of each title is an appeal to students who think that the subject is boring, or too difficult, or both. The authors, all experienced educators, take a light approach, showing kids what is most interesting about each subject, and how seemingly difficult problems can be transformed into fun quizzes, brain-ticklers, and challenging puzzles with rational solutions. Here is practical advice that transforms essay writing into a satisfying experience for middle school and senior high school students. The author offers tips on enlivening writing with vivid images, smoothing out sentences, silencing the dull passive voice, and adding rhythm to writing. He also shows how to create a template that students can use when writing research papers for all subjects. In addition, students will find web site reference s cited throughout the text, which they can access. Brain ticklers (short quizzes) appear throughout the book with an answer key at the back.",
