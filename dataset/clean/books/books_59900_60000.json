        "Title": "Do You Speak American?",
        "Authors": "By MacNeil, Robert and Cran, William",
        "Description": "Is American English in decline? Are regional dialects dying out? Is there a difference between men and women in how they adapt to linguistic variations?These questions, and more, about our language catapulted Robert MacNeil and William Cran\u2014the authors (with Robert McCrum) of the language classic The Story of English\u2014across the country in search of the answers. Do You Speak American? is the tale of their discoveries, which provocatively show how the standard for American English\u2014if a standard exists\u2014is changing quickly and dramatically. On a journey that takes them from the Northeast, through Appalachia and the Deep South, and west to California, the authors observe everyday verbal interactions and in a host of interviews with native speakers glean the linguistic quirks and traditions characteristic of each area. While examining the histories and controversies surrounding both written and spoken American English, they address anxieties and assumptions that, when explored, are highly emotional, such as the growing influence of Spanish as a threat to American English and the special treatment of African-American vernacular English.  And, challenging the purists who think grammatical standards are in serious deterioration and that media saturation of our culture is homogenizing our speech, they surprise us with unpredictable responses.With insight and wit, MacNeil and Cran bring us a compelling book that is at once a celebration and a potent study of our singular language.Each wave of immigration has brought new words to enrich the American language. Do you recognize the origin of 1. blunderbuss, sleigh, stoop, coleslaw, boss, waffle?Or2. dumb, ouch, shyster, check, kaput, scram, bummer?Or3. phooey, pastrami, glitch, kibbitz, schnozzle?Or4. broccoli, espresso, pizza, pasta, macaroni, radio?Or5. smithereens, lollapalooza, speakeasy, hooligan?Or6. vamoose, chaps, stampede, mustang, ranch, corral?1.

        "Title": "The Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, Civil Warfare, And The Triumph Of Anglo-America",
        "Authors": "By Phillips, Kevin",
        "Description": "The question at the heart of The Cousins' Wars is this: How did Anglo-America evolve over a mere three hundred years from a small Tudor kingdom into a global community with such a hegemonic grip on the world today, while no other European power?Spain, France, Germany, or Russia?did? The answer to this, according to Phillips, lies in a close examination of three internecine English-speaking civil wars?the English Civil War, the American Revolution, and the American Civil War. These wars between cousins functioned as crucial anvils on which various religious, ethnic, and political alliances were hammered out between the English-speaking cousin-nations, setting them on a unique two-track path toward world leadership?one aristocratic and aloof to dominate the imperial nineteenth century and the other more egalitarian and democratic to take over in the twentieth century. They also functioned as unfortunate and deadly cultural crucibles for African Americans, Native Americans, and the Irish.Phillips's analysis shows exactly how these conflicts are inextricably linked and how they seeded each other. He offers often surprising interpretations that cut across the political spectrum?for instance, that the Constitution of the United States, while brilliant in many respects, was also a fatally flawed political compromise that contributed mightily in setting the stage for the final?and the bloodiest?cousins' war: the American Civil War.With the new millennium upon us and triggering widespread assessment of our nation's place in world history, The Cousins' Wars provides just the kind of magisterial sweep and revisionist spark to ignite widespread interest and debate. This grand religious, military, and political epic is the multi-dimensional story of the triumph of Anglo-America.",

A disciple of Plato and the tutor to Alexander the Great, Aristotle was a prolific writer, although many of his works have been lost. His treatises, used by the students of his famous Athenian school, the Lyceum, exerted a profound and lasting influence on Western thought.Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics is one of the world's great books. Identifying happiness as the goal of life, he rejects pleasure, fame, and wealth as means to it. The summit of human achievement is attainable only through the contemplation of philosophic truth, because this practice exercises the virtue peculiar to the human being, the rational principle.This inexpensive edition of a philosophical landmark will prove an invaluable resource to students and general readers alike.",

For three generations the Kennedy family has been in the public eye, and for three generations their marriages have been the equivalent of \"Royal Matches.\"  This book covers the senior generation wedding of Joe and Rose, the second generation weddings--most notably of Jack and Jackie, Bobby and Ethel--and all of the third generation weddings: John Jr. and Carolyn Bessette, Caroline and Ed Schlossberg, Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kerry and Andrew Cuomo, Kathleen and Peter Townsend, Courtney and Paul Hill, Michael and Victoria Gifford.The accompanying images, acquired from members of the Kennedy family, private collections of friends, and the JFK Library and National Archives, are as rare as they are unusual--many have never been published, or were published only at the time of the wedding. Kennedy Weddings is the result of years of extensive research and has benefited from the unprecedented cooperation of many members of the Kennedy family, most especially of Senator Edward Kennedy's office.",

        "Description": "The New York Times-bestselling author of White Lies presents her newest Arcane Society novel.  With more than 25 million books sold, Jayne Ann Krentz \"excels at crafting superior, sexy romantic suspense\" (Booklist), and with her Arcane Society novels-written under both the Krentz and Amanda Quick names-she has thrilled readers with paranormal plots and passionate love stories. In her latest novel, a member of the Society must recruit a reluctant woman to use her psychic gift against a powerful enemy.  When Raine Tallentyre made the mistake of revealing her paranormal abilities, her most recent romantic relationship came to a hasty end. Her Aunt Vella, a gifted but troubled soul, had told her years ago to keep her talents a secret. And now that poor Aunt Vella-her last blood relative-has died, Raine has resigned herself to a lonely life.  But when she journeys to Shelbyville, Washington, to clear out Aunt Vella's house, Raine's highly developed sensitivity leads her to a horrifying discovery: a young woman bound and terrified in a basement storage locker. The victim has survived, but the culprit is still on the loose. Without warning, a new man enters Raine's life-investigator Zack Jones. Surprisingly, Zack isn't repelled by her powers: in fact, he has them himself. While Raine hears voices, Zack sees visions and within hours of their meeting, Raine experiences an intense, thrilling intimacy-mental, emotional, and physical-she never dared to expect.  There's one complication, however: Zack Jones is working for the Arcane Society. This secret organization, dedicated to the study of paranormal phenomena, shattered Raine's family with an act of betrayal long ago, and she's not about to trust them now. But as a killer makes her his target, and a cabal of psychic criminals known as Nightshade operates in the shadows surrounding them, Raine and Zack must rely not only on their powerful abilities but on each other . . .  From the author who also hits bestseller lists under the names Jayne Castle and Amanda Quick, this is a delightful new caper filled with suspense and wit-and the steamy Victorian passion her devoted readers love.",

        "Description": "Good ideas are not easy to cultivate. They need rich soil, attention, and encouragement to take root and grow. Jim Adams&#39;s classic Conceptual Blockbusting was a handbook to weeding your garden, to clearing your mind of rubbish that stifles creative thought. The Care and Feeding of Ideas is its long-awaited sequel, a guide to creating a greenhouse environment in which ideas can thrive.&#147;If you&#39;re serious about encouraging creativity\u201d, writes Adams, &#147;you need to understand the entire creative process-from concept to reality.\u201d You need to understand thinking-the mysteries and mechanics of creative thought. You need to understand doing-the actions you can take to increase your creativity. Only by becoming aware of how you conceptualize, and of the techniques that lead to better problem solving, can you begin to bring forth your very best ideas.Adams leads a tour through the unconscious mind, the brain and nervous system, and the storehouse of memory, and points out how they work (and conspire against us) when we tackle problems. He shows that bad problem-solving habits can be broken, that money and time are your muse&#39;s best friends, that creativity involves risk but the risk is worth it, and that the stereo you bought with your last bonus was not a luxury but a necessary reward. He illustrates his arguments with ingenious games and exercises that will surpirse you with what they reveal about your patterns of thought. Whether you&#39;re a midnight novelist or a managment consultant, a Sunday painter or a city planner, this book can forever change the way you approach creative challenges.",

        "Title": "God and the Philosophers: The Reconciliation of Faith and Reason",
        "Authors": "By Morris, Thomas V. (EDT)",
        "Description": "\"I am a philosopher because I am a Christian,\" writes Brian Leftow. \"To many intellectuals, this probably sounds like saying that I am a dog because I am a cat.\" Indeed, prejudice against religious belief runs deep in the academy; in particular, many philosophers hold that faith is incompatible with their profession. But Thomas Morris has met that view head-on by asking a distinguished group of philosophers to write about the union of faith and reason in their lives. God and the Philosphers offers a series of highly personal, thoughtful essays by traditionally religious philosophers, revealing the power of belief in their intellectually rigorous lives and work. Figures such as William P. Alston, William J. Wainwright, Marilyn McCord Adams, Peter van Inwagen, and Morris himself, to name a few, speak of their own spiritual journeys, sharing their experiences as philosphically reflective individuals seeking to center themselves on God. We read of conversions from unbelief, struggles with doubts raised by the presence of evil in the world, and changing convictions shaped by constant questioning and communing with God.  For example, Brian Leftow describes his acceptance of Christianity, after being raised in a secular Jewish home, and Laura Garcia writes about her conversion to Catholicism from her earlier Protestant stance.  Along the way, the writers reveal religious philosophy at work--demonstrating, as Arthur F. Holmes writes, \"the motivation to intellectual inquiry that Christian faith brings.\" Here we see how individuals with extraordinary intellectual training, discipline, and knowledge grapple with personal and existential problems, drawing on their faith as well as their finely honed reason to achieve new understanding. Profoundly honest and deeply thoughtful, these essays reveal how highly educated philosophers--working in the halls of dispassionate analysis--come to grips with their faith in a skeptical world.  Together, they make a profound statement on contemporary spirituality, and the quandaries facing today's religious individual.",

In Savage's funniest, most biting book yet, the nation's fiercest independent thinker invites you to take a riotous tour throughThe Political Zoo-an outrageous look at today's most prominent politicos and pundits as the reptiles, rats, and birds of prey they most resemble.Animal by animal and cage by cage, Savage brandishes his irreverent wit to keep these beasts in check. Serving as resident biologist and zookeeper, Dr. Savage asks that you watch your step when approaching the widemouth copperhead Ted Turner (also known as Mouthus desouthus), do not feed the ego of stuffed turkey Alec Baldwin (Notalentus anti-americanus), and please keep your children with you at all times around wolf boy Bill Clinton (Fondlem undgropeum).\"The world of politics is filled with uncivilized, snarling, rapacious beasts that, like untrained mutts, raise their legs and urinate on everything we hold dear,\" says Savage. And this sensational book is your guide for navigating the jungle of today's animal-political kingdom.",

        "Title": "The Age of Miracles: Embracing the New Midlife",
        "Authors": "By Williamson, Marianne",
        "Description": "The need for change as we get older\u2014an emotional pressure for one phase of our lives to transition into another\u2014is a human phenomenon, neither male nor female. There simply comes a time in our lives\u2014not fundamentally different from the way puberty separates childhood from adulthood\u2014when it\u2019s time for one part of ourselves to die and for something new to be born.The purpose of this book by best-selling author and lecturer\u00a0Marianne Williamson\u00a0is to psychologically and spiritually reframe this transition so that it leads to a wonderful sense of joy and awakening.In our ability to rethink our lives lies our greatest power to change them. What we have called \u201cmiddle age\u201d need not be seen as a turning point toward death. It can be viewed as a magical turning point toward life as we\u2019ve never known it, if we allow ourselves the power of an independent imagination\u2014thought-forms that don\u2019t flow in a perfunctory manner from ancient assumptions merely handed down to us, but rather flower into new archetypal images of a humanity just getting started at 45 or 50.What we\u2019ve learned by that time, from both our failures as well as our successes, tends to have humbled us into purity. When we were young, we had energy but we were clueless about what to do with it. Today, we have less energy, perhaps, but we have far more understanding of what each breath of life is for. And now at last, we have a destiny to fulfill\u2014not a destiny of a life that\u2019s simply over, but rather a destiny of a life that is finally truly lived.Midlife is not a crisis; it\u2019s a time of rebirth. It\u2019s not a time to accept your death; it\u2019s a time to accept your\u00a0life\u2014and to finally, truly live it, as you and you alone know deep in your heart it was meant to be lived.",

        "Description": "\"Pythagoras's influence on the ideas, and therefore on the destiny, of the human race was probably greater than that of any single man before or after him,\" wrote Arthur Koestler. Though most people know of him only for the famous Pythagorean Theorem (a2 +b2=c2), in fact the pillars of our scientific tradition-belief that the universe is rational, that there is unity to all things, and that numbers and mathematics are a powerful guide to truth about nature and the cosmos-hark back to the convictions of this legendary sixth-century B.C. scholar. Born around 570 B.C. on the cultured Aegean island of Samos, Pythagoras (according to ancient tales) studied with the sage Thales nearby at Miletus, and with priests and scribes in Egypt and Babylon. Eventually he founded his own school at Croton in southern Italy, where he and his followers began to unravel the surprising deep truths concealed behind such ordinary tasks as tuning a lyre. While considering why some string lengths produced beautiful sounds and others discordant ones, they uncovered the ratios of musical harmony, and recognized that hidden behind the confusion and complexity of nature are patterns and orderly relationships. They had surprised the Creator at his drafting board and had glimpsed the mind of God! Some of them later would also find something darker in numbers and nature: irrationality, a revelation so unsettling and subversive that it may have contributed to the destruction of their brotherhood. Kitty Ferguson brilliantly evokes the archaic world of Pythagoras, showing how ideas spread in antiquity, chronicling the influence he and his followers have had on so many extraordinary people in the history of Western thought and science, and bringing a poignant human saga to readers who are daily reminded that harmony and chaos can and do coexist.",
