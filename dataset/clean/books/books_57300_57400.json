        "Authors": "By Peters, Ruth",
        "Description": "Discipline is not a four-letter word.As a respected child psychologist and mom with more than 20 years' experience, Dr. Ruth Peters knows that kids can be manipulative--and she offers parents a positive, no-nonsense approach to bringing about family harmony.Kids know exactly what to do when their parents relinquish authority--take advantage!  Don't Be Afraid to Discipline focuses on several ineffective parenting styles that kids thrive on, such as the emotionally needy parents or the happiness-seeking parent.  Dr. Peters also helps parents identify which tactics their children like to use best, whether it's provoking parental guilt or pitting Mom against Dad.  Don't Be Afraid to Discipline helps parents avoid these common pitfalls by establishing clear, consistent, fair rules for both themselves and their kids.  There are no surprises and no complaints, because the kids know exactly what will happen if they misbehave.The book features behavior management charts tailored for elementary middle and high schoolers, information on attention deficit disorder, specific advice on the special disciplinary problems of single parents and stepfamilies, and a frank discussion about children who are seriously troubled.  Don't Be Afraid to Discipline is a welcome approach to child misbehavior for weary parents in need of simple, direct answers.",

        "Authors": "By Wills, Garry",
        "Description": "In \"Negro President,\" the best-selling historian Garry Wills explores a controversial and neglected aspect of Thomas Jefferson's presidency: it was achieved by virtue of slave \"representation,\" and conducted to preserve that advantage.Wills goes far beyond the recent revisionist debate over Jefferson's own slaves and his relationship with Sally Heming to look at the political relationship between the president and slavery. Jefferson won the election of 1800 with Electoral College votes derived from the three-fifths representation of slaves, who could not vote but who were partially counted as citizens. That count was known as \"the slave power\" granted to southern states, and it made some Federalists call Jefferson the Negro President -- one elected only by the slave count's margin.Probing the heart of Jefferson's presidency, Wills reveals how the might of the slave states was a concern behind Jefferson's most important decisions and policies, including his strategy to expand the nation west. But the president met with resistance: Timothy Pickering, now largely forgotten, was elected to Congress to wage a fight against Jefferson and the institutions that supported him. Wills restores Pickering and his allies' dramatic struggle to our understanding of Jefferson and the creation of the new nation.In \"Negro President,\" Wills offers a bold rethinking of one of American history's greatest icons.",

        "Description": "From sharing secrets as children to chasing unconventional dreams as adults, network correspondent Sara James and wildlife filmmaker Ginger Mauney explore their learning curve on life through the lens of their thirty-year friendshipTransplanting southern roots to southern Africa, Ginger Mauney has earned the acceptance of a troop of baboons, unraveled mysteries of life and death in an elephant herd, and raised her young son in the wilds of Namibia\u2014but has often felt the pull of the country she once called home. As a local television anchor, Sara James paid her own way to cover the war in Nicaragua, a gamble that later propelled her to NBC. At the network, James exposed slavery in Sudan and plunged to the gravesite of the Titanic, but struggled to balance her demanding career with marriage and motherhood.Though the two lead seemingly opposite lives, there is much they share: a hometown in Richmond, Virginia, an attraction to life on the razor's edge, a weakness for men with foreign passports and accents, and a past. Now, in their heartfelt memoir, Mauney and James alternately narrate the story of how, they, two women separated by thousands of miles, have found themselves bound together through temperament, circumstance, and serendipity. The Best of Friends uses the example of their lives to explore such universal questions as: When your heart is broken, how do you heal? How do you realize your dreams without compromising yourself? How do you tame ambition to make room for love and family? And what does it mean as an adult to be a \"best\" friend?The Best of Friends is James and Mauney's story, but it is also the story of so many women in their twenties, thirties, and forties who, with the help of friends, dared to reinvent their lives just when it seemed that everything was falling apart.",

Over the years, Shirley has firmly established herself as a fearless, iconoclastic thinker and seeker of truth. Now, as she confronts the realities and rewards of growing older, she reflects on the greater understanding of her own place in the universe that her experiences have brought to her. Sparked by the experience of moving into a new house, she is inspired to look back across the remarkable professional and personal milestones she has experienced so far. Surrounded by books, pictures, and the artifacts of a life well lived, Shirley is able to recognize the profound power of synchronicity at work around her, discovering the invisible threads that stitch together the seemingly random events of her days, adding meaning even to the mundane. Having grown older, she is increasingly concerned with the potential pitfalls of modern medicine. She shares personal insights into nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathy, and alternative medicine. Practical and bracing, here is advice for anyone looking to expand his or her understanding of health and well-being. Moving beyond the physical, Shirley explores what has always interested her most -- those things that are unseen. What is consciousness? What is the purpose of our lives? Are we alone in the universe? And perhaps the greatest mystery of all, what happens to us after death?Filled with her trademark wit and candor, this is a fascinating, inspiring book that will delight and captivate Shirley's legions of fans and fellow travelers everywhere.",

We are so submerged by our towns\u2019 lights, constantly busy, hypnotized by the television, that we hardly have time to contemplate the sky at night.We forget the stars\u2019 beauty, the planet\u2019s slow sliding, the lunar rhythms and the rotations of planets, season after season. This book is here to capture people\u2019s imagination through pictures, and to stimulate the reader to regain an interest in the stars, which was part of people\u2019s daily life less than one century ago. It teaches us how to use binoculars to discover the Moon and the stages of Venus, and allows one to find their own constellation of the zodiac. It keeps us fascinated by this science, the first real science of man, as was the case with thousands of studious and keen people all those years ago; it allows one to have a closer look at the universe thanks to a modern and powerful machines and gives one the opportunity to see the Sun, the planets and the stars too, in a different and unexpected way. It enables one to discover the existence of evanescent waves and galaxies about which we can only voice a theory of a beginning and an end.  It is not just a dry text book but also one of philosophy of how this information could have been gathered together, what are the certainties and the limits, and where to find help and future indications to make a link with our own horizons.This book was neither written for people who work in this sector nor for the adepts of astrology.This book was conceived for those who don\u2019t like formulae and for those who are interested in the sciences and the world in general and may have been put off by the harsh teaching methods at school.It\u2019s a book made for those who would like to spend an evening with the Infinite or their spend their holidays in rediscovery of the dark skies of isolated towns, a distant, strange and silent world which one is able to understand better and discover more of  each day. easy to understand with stories about astronomy and spatial researches, from the most easily observable objects in the darkness to the most recent astrological knowledge.\u2022 48 celestial cards concerning 3 different areas of the north and south allow plotting the most beautiful constellations in the night anywhere you are. Those reproduce at midnight the Milky Way of Equinox and Solstice but that also allows one to represent the sky, at 11.00 pm as it was 15 days before, at 10.00 pm as it was 30 days before or at 9.00 pm as it was 45 days before. In the same way, at 1.00 am it is possible to produce it as it will be the next 15 days, at 2.00 am as it will be the next 30 days or at 3.00 am as it will be the next 45 days.\u2022 The 7 best pictures of the moon will allow anyone to reproduce the most important satellite formations using just a simple set of binoculars: first, a moving passage through the sky.  Simple suggestions and indications allow one to quickly recognise and reproduce the main constellations and to complete some of the more delicate ones with a telescope.

And Julia never knows what's going on anyway.What we do know is that we started the notebook in freshman year at Stuyvesant High School as a way to keep in contact when our conflicting schedules denied us one another's company. It allowed us to express ourselves and our views of the world in a tone of complete sarcasm, obscenity, and blind honesty. We've spent a significant portion of our adolescence trying to figure out who we are. The notebook is the closest we've come.We're just a group of normal girls with normal lives.

Can bosses actually learn something from marriages? Are very close friendships in the workplace such a bad thing? These are just a few of the questions that #1 New York Times bestselling author Tom Rath asked when he embarked on a massive study of friendships. Along with several leading researchers, Rath pored through the literature, conducted several experiments, and analyzed more than 5 million interviews from The Gallup Organization\u2019s worldwide database. His team\u2019s discoveries produced Vital Friends, a book that challenges long-held assumptions people have about their relationships. And the team\u2019s landmark discovery \u2014 that people who have a \u201cbest friend at work\u201d are seven times as likely to be engaged in their job \u2014 is sure to rattle the structure of organizations around the world. Drawing on research and case studies from topics as diverse as marriage, management, and architecture, Vital Friends reveals what\u2019s common to all truly essential friendships: a regular focus on what each person is contributing to the friendship \u2014 rather than the all-too-common approach of expecting one person to be everything. The book includes a unique ID code that provides access to the Vital Friends Assessment and website. This groundbreaking test reveals which friends play each of the eight vital friendship roles in your life. Tom Rath\u2019s fast-paced and inviting storytelling takes a mountain of important research and makes it remarkably accessible and applicable. By the time you finish reading Vital Friends, you\u2019ll see your family, friends, coworkers, and significant other in a whole new light.",

        "Description": "Too many people have decided that the safest way to get through life is to be small. They try not to attract attention to themselves, just tending their own safe little garden. They\u2019ve decided it\u2019s too dangerous to think big, to speak out, to take risks. They might get shot down. Or look foolish. People will think they\u2019re just not good enough. But, particularly today, organizations need people to step up and be BIG. We need new ideas, new products, new processes. People have to bring more of themselves to the workplace, to contribute more, and to have a bigger impact on the success of the organization. This inspiring illustrated book challenges all of us to show up more fully as individuals and in our interactions with others and to find ways to be BIG together. In straightforward, incisive language, Judith Katz and Frederick Miller help us understand all of the many, sometimes subtle ways we make ourselves small. They show how we make others small as well and how these same attitudes can keep us from working together effectively. And they encourage us to nourish new attitudes that will make us, our coworkers, and our organizations bigger. Be BIG invites us to bring more of ourselves to each situation\u2014whether working independently, with another individual, or with a group\u2014so that we can do our best work together.",

Celebrated for her looks, notorious for her passions, immortalized by Antonio Canova\u2019s statue, and always deeply loyal to her brother, Pauline Bonaparte Borghese is a fascinating figure in her own right.At the turn of the nineteenth century, she was considered by many to be the most beautiful woman in Europe. She shocked the continent with the boldness of her love affairs, her opulent wardrobe and jewels, and, most famously, her decision to pose nearly nude for Canova\u2019s sculpture, which has been replicated in countless ways through the years. But just as remarkable as Pauline\u2019s private life was her fidelity to the emperor (if not to her husbands). She was present for Napoleon\u2019s great victories in Italy, and she was often at Malmaison with her brother and her rival for his loyalty, the empress Josephine. When he was exiled to Elba, Pauline was the only sibling to follow him there, and after the final defeat at Waterloo she begged to be allowed to join him at Saint Helena.No biographer has gone so deeply into the sources or so closely examined one of the seminal relationships of the man who shaped modern Europe. In Pauline Bonaparte: Venus of Empire, Flora Fraser has cast new light on the Napoleonic era while crafting a dynamic, vivid portrait of a mesmerizing woman.",

It is a battle not between armies or nations, but between the forces of good and evil, a war in which God is believed to be directly engaged on behalf of one side against the other. The hijackers who attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, thought they were fighting a cosmic war. According to award-winning writer and scholar of religions Reza Aslan, by infusing the United States War on Terror with the same kind of religiously polarizing rhetoric and Manichean worldview, is also fighting a cosmic war\u2013a war that can\u2019t be won.  How to Win a Cosmic War is both an in-depth study of the ideology fueling al-Qa\u2018ida, the Taliban, and like-minded militants throughout the Muslim world, and an exploration of religious violence in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Surveying the global scene from Israel to Iraq and from New York to the Netherlands, Aslan argues that religion is a stronger force today than it has been in a century. At a time when religion and politics are increasingly sharing the same vocabulary and functioning in the same sphere, Aslan writes that we must strip the conflicts of our world\u2013in particular, the War on Terror\u2013of their religious connotations and address the earthly grievances that always lie behind the cosmic impulse.

Written by Carter in 1923, only a year after the discovery, this book captures the overwhelming exhilaration of the find, the painstaking, step-by-step process of excavation, and the wonder of opening a treasure-filled inner chamber whose regal inhabitant had been dead for 3,000 years.104 on-the-spot photographs chronicle the phases of the discovery and the scrupulous cataloging of the treasures. The opening chapters discuss the life of Tutankhamen and earlier archeological work in the Valley of the Kings. An appendix contains fully captioned photographs of the objects obtained from the tomb. A new preface by Jon Manchip White adds information on Carter's career, recent opinions on Tutankhamen's reign, and the importance of Carter's discovery to Egyptologists.Millions have seen the stunning artifacts which came from the tomb \u2014 they are among the glories of the Cairo Museum, and have made triumphal tours to museums the world over.

        "Description": "In his most enthralling novel yet, the critically acclaimed author Matthew Pearl reopens one of literary history\u2019s greatest mysteries. The Last Dickens is a tale filled with the dazzling twists and turns, the unerring period details, and the meticulous research that thrilled readers of the bestsellers The Dante Club and The Poe Shadow.Boston, 1870. When news of Charles Dickens\u2019s untimely death reaches the office of his struggling American publisher, Fields & Osgood, partner James Osgood sends his trusted clerk Daniel Sand to await the arrival of Dickens\u2019s unfinished novel. But when Daniel\u2019s body is discovered by the docks and the manuscript is nowhere to be found, Osgood must embark on a transatlantic quest to unearth the novel that he hopes will save his venerable business and reveal Daniel\u2019s killer.Danger and intrigue abound on the journey to England, for which Osgood has chosen Rebecca Sand, Daniel\u2019s older sister, to assist him. As they attempt to uncover Dickens\u2019s final mystery, Osgood and Rebecca find themselves racing the clock through a dangerous web of literary lions and drug dealers, sadistic thugs and blue bloods, and competing members of Dickens\u2019s inner circle. They soon realize that understanding Dickens\u2019s lost ending is a matter of life and death, and the hidden key to stopping a murderous mastermind.",

        "Description": "Howard Fineman, one of our most trusted political journalists, shows that every debate, from our nation\u2019s founding to the present day, is rooted in one of thirteen arguments that\u2013thankfully\u2013defy resolution. It is the very process of never-ending argument, Fineman explains, that defines us, inspires us, and keeps us free. At a time when most public disagreement seems shrill and meaningless, Fineman makes a cogent case for nurturing the real American dialogue. The Thirteen American Arguments runs the gamut, including\u2022 Who Is a Person? The Declaration of Independence says \u201ceveryone,\u201d but it took a Civil War, the Civil Rights Act, and other movements to make that a reality. Now, what about human embryos and prisoners in Guantanamo?\u2022 The Role of Faith No country is more legally secular yet more avowedly prayerful. From Thomas Jefferson to James Dobson, the issue persists: Where does God fit in government?\u2022 America in the World In Iraq and everywhere else, we ask ourselves whether we must change the world in order to survive and honor our values\u2013or whether the best way to do both is to deal with the world as it is.Whether it\u2019s the nomination of judges or the limits of free speech, presidential power or public debt, the issues that galvanized the Founding Fathers should still inspire our leaders, thinkers, and fellow citizens. If we cease to argue about these things, we cease to be. \u201cArgument is strength, not weakness,\u201d says Fineman. \u201cAs long as we argue, there is hope, and as long as there is hope, we will argue.\u201d",

        "Title": "Finn: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Clinch, Jon",
        "Description": "In this masterful debut by a major new voice in fiction, Jon Clinch takes us on a journey into the history and heart of one of American literature\u2019s most brutal and mysterious figures: Huckleberry Finn\u2019s father. The result is a deeply original tour de force that springs from Twain\u2019s classic novel but takes on a fully realized life of its own.Finn sets a tragic figure loose in a landscape at once familiar and mythic. It begins and ends with a lifeless body\u2013flayed and stripped of all identifying marks\u2013drifting down the Mississippi. The circumstances of the murder, and the secret of the victim\u2019s identity, shape Finn\u2019s story as they will shape his life and his death.Along the way Clinch introduces a cast of unforgettable characters: Finn\u2019s terrifying father, known only as the Judge; his sickly, sycophantic brother, Will; blind Bliss, a secretive moonshiner; the strong and quick-witted Mary, a stolen slave who becomes Finn\u2019s mistress; and of course young Huck himself. In daring to re-create Huck for a new generation, Clinch gives us a living boy in all his human complexity\u2013not an icon, not a myth, but a real child facing vast possibilities in a world alternately dangerous and bright.Finn is a novel about race; about paternity in its many guises; about the shame of a nation recapitulated by the shame of one absolutely unforgettable family. Above all, Finn reaches back into the darkest waters of America\u2019s past to fashion something compelling, fearless, and new. Praise for Finn\u201cA brave and ambitious debut novel\u2026 It stands on its own while giving new life and meaning to Twain\u2019s novel, which has been stirring passions and debates since 1885\u2026 triumph of imagination and graceful writing\u2026. Bookstores and libraries shelve novels alphabetically by authors\u2019 names. That leaves Clinch a long way from Twain. But on my bookshelves, they'll lean against each other. I\u2019d like to think that the cantankerous Twain would welcome the company.\u201d\u2013USA TODAY\u201cRavishing\u2026In the saga of this tormented human being, Clinch brings us a radical (and endlessly debatable) new take on Twain\u2019s classic, and a stand-alone marvel of a novel. Grade: A.\u201d\u2013ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY\u201cA fascinating, original read.\u201d\u2013people\u201cHaunting\u2026Clinch reimagines Finn in a strikingly original way, replacing Huck\u2019s voice with his own magisterial vision\u2013one that\u2019s nothing short of revelatory\u2026Spellbinding.\u201d\u2013WASHINGTON POST\u201cMeticulously crafted\u2026Marvelous imagination\u2026The Finn of Clinch\u2019s novel is certainly a racist villain but also psychologically disturbed and disconcertingly compelling.\u201d\u2013SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE\u201cFrom the barest of hints in Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, Clinch has created a fully believable world inhabited by fully realized characters. Clinch treads dangerous ground in making one of America\u2019s greatest novels his jumping-off point, but he brings it off magnificently\u2026The language of this book is one of its great beauties\u2026Finn is far from one-dimensional, and that is another beauty of the book. Clinch has a knack for putting us squarely inside the heads of his characters\u2026.Clinch draws as compelling and realistic a picture as any we\u2019re likely to find\u2026Finn stands on its own. The richness of its language, the depth of its characters, the emotional and societal tangles through which they struggle to navigate add up to a portrait of life on the Mississippi as we\u2019ve never before experienced it.\u201d\u2013dallas morning news\u201cHis models may include Cormac McCarthy, and Charles Frazier, whose Cold Mountain also has a voice that sounds like 19th-century American (both formal and colloquial) but has a contemporary terseness and spikiness. This voice couldn\u2019t be better suited to a historical novel with a modernist sensibility: Clinch\u2019s riverbank Missouri feels postapocalyptic, and his Pap Finn is a crazed yet wily survivor in a polluted landscape\u2026Clinch\u2019s Pap is a convincingly nightmarish extrapolation of Twain\u2019s. He\u2019s the mad, lost and dangerous center of a world we\u2019d hate to live in\u2013or do we still live there?\u2013and crave to revisit as soon as we close the book.\u201d\u2013newsweek\u201cI haven\u2019t been swallowed whole by a work of fiction in some time. Jon Clinch\u2019s first novel has done it: sucked me under like I was a rag doll thrown into the wake of a Mississippi steamboat\u2026Jon Clinch has turned in a nearly perfect first book, a creative response that matches The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in intensity and tenacious soul-searching about racism. I wish I could write well enough to construct a dramatic, subtle and mysterious story out of careful, plodding and unromantic prose, but for now I\u2019m just happy to have an alchemist like Jon Clinch do it for me.\u201d\u2013BOOKSLUT\u201cFinn strikes its most original chords in its bold imagining of possibilities left unexplored by Huckleberry Finn.\u201d\u2013austin american-statesman\u201cAn inspired riff on one of literature\u2019s all-time great villains\u2026This tale of fathers and sons, slavery and freedom, better angels at war with dark demons, is filled with passages of brilliant description, violence that is close-up and terrifying\u2026Everything in this novel could have happened, and we believe it\u2026 so the great river of stories is too, twisting and turning, inspiring such surprising and inspired riffs and tributes as Finn.\u201d\u2013new orleans times-picayune\u201cA triumph of succesful plotting, convincing characterization and lyrical prose.\u201d\u2013ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS\u201cShocking and charming. Clinch creates a folk-art masterpiece that will delight, beguile and entertain as it does justice to its predecessor\u2026In Finn, Clinch expands the bloodlines and scope of the original story and casts new light on the troubled legacy of our country\u2019s infamous past.\u201d\u2013new york post\u201cIn Clinch\u2019s retelling, Pap Finn comes vibrantly to life as a complex, mysterious, strangely likable figure\u2026Clinch includes many sharply realized, sometimes harrowing, even gruesome scenes\u2026Finn should appeal not only to scholars of 19th century literature but to anyone who cares to sample a forceful debut novel inspired by a now-mythic American story.\u201d\u2013atlanta journal-consitution\u201cWhat makes bearable this river voyage that never ventures far beyond the banks is the compelling narrative Clinch has created. He writes exceedingly well, not with the immediacy Twain imbued to Huck's voice, but with an impersonal narrator\u2019s voice that almost perversely refuses to take sides. And the plot is masterful.\u201d\u2013fredericksburg freelance-star\u201cDisturbing and darkly compelling\u2026Clinch displays impressive imagination and descriptiveness\u2026anyone who encounters Finn will long be hautned by this dark and bloody tale.\u201d\u2013hartford courant\u201cJon Clinch pulls off the near impossible in his new novel, Finn, which brings Huck's dad to life in all his terrible humanness\u2026Clinch vividly paints the origins of the amazing Huck...powerfully told.\u201d\u2013winston-salem journal\u201cGripping\u2026he inventively remaps known literary territory\u2026the descriptive riffs are lucent.\u201d\u2013chicago tribune\u201cThe best debut so far of 2007.\u201d\u2013men\u2019s journal\u201cInventing Huckleberry Finn\u2019s father using only the thin scraps of information that Mark Twain provided is a pretty admirable feat, and reading Jon Clinch\u2019s first novel provides an almost tactile pleasure\u2026Clinch clearly respects Twain, but he doesn\u2019t feel especially cowed by his inspiration, and some of his inventions qualify as genuine improvements on the original text.\u201d\u2013washington city paper\u201cIn this darkly luminous debut\u2026Clinch lyrically renders the Mississippi River\u2019s ceaseless flow, while revealing Finn\u2019s brutal contradictions, his violence, arrogance and self-reproach.\u201d\u2013Publishers Weekly, STARRED review \u201cBold and deeply disturbing. . . A few incidents duplicate those in Twain, but the novels could not be more different; instead of Huck\u2019s unlettered child\u2019s voice, we have an omniscient narrative, grave, erudite and rich in the secretions of adult knowledge; terse dialogue acts as an effective counterpoint. All along, Clinch\u2019s intent is to probe the nature of evil . . . a memorable debut, likely to make waves.\u201d\u2013KIRKUS REVIEWS, STARRED review \u201cEvery fan of Twain\u2019s masterpiece will want to read this inspired spin-off, which could become an unofficial companion volume.\u201d\u2013LIBRARY JOURNAL, STARRED review \u201cThis is a bold debut that takes a few tentative steps in tandem with the familiar Twain, but then veers off dexterously down a much more insidious, harrowing path.\u201d\u2013BOOKLIST\u201cJon Clinch\u2019s first novel Finn\u2026succeeds wonderfully because its gritty lyricism is at once authentic and original\u2026reminiscent at times of Cormac McCarthy\u2026the eloquence of the telling will never make the courageous reader wish for a gentler touch. Like any appealing novel, Finn achieves the force of a dream with fascinating actions, indelible characters and spellbinding language.  Its author is wily, astute and wise\u2026 Finn is a challenging and rewarding exploration of the suffering human heart.  From the ominous shadow that was Pap Finn, Clinch has fashioned an unforgettable, twisted man and a marvelous novel.\u201d\u2013ROANOKE TIMES \u201cNext month Clinch makes his publishing debut with Finn, taking up where Mark Twain left Mr. Finn 120 years ago: dead in a room surrounded by such mysterious oddities as a wooden leg, women's underclothing, and two black cloth masks. It\u2019s a great read.\u201d \u2013Knoxville News Sentinel",

On top of the usual teenage humiliations, he now has to learn to say \"y'all\" and \"Co-Cola\" or risk being ostracized as a Yankee. But Daniel's loneliness fades when he meets fellow outsider Tim Cousins. You only need one best friend, Daniel figures, to make it through high school alive.Daniel and Tim immediately become inseparable, sharing a fascination with ridicule, The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and Arnita Beecham, the most bewitching girl at Minor High. The boys learn algebra from a teacher whose mind may be slipping off the tracks. They join the cast of a bouncy evangelical musical called Christ! (think Mary Magdalene singing \"I'm Not That Kind of Girl\"). They take their dates to the prom in matching Sky Blue tuxedos and kiss them in Tim's father's Buick to \"Nights in White Satin.\"But then things start to go terribly wrong. The friends' feud with Red Martin, star linebacker and school bully, gets out of hand. They commit a small crime that grows larger and larger, and threatens to engulf the whole town. Arnita, the first black prom queen in the history of the school, is injured and wakes up a different person. And Daniel and Tim and their families are swept up in a shocking chain of events.",

        "Authors": "By Satloff, Robert B. (EDT) and Weinberg Founders Conference",
        "Description": "The attacks of September 11 were transformative events, both in how Americans view their own sense of security and in how America engages with the world. Although the initial battle in the U.S.-led war against terror has been fought in central and south Asia, the principles behind that campaign have special resonance in the Middle East. This region is home to organizations which share both ideology and methodology with the perpetrators of the September 11 terrorist attacks. In addition, many aspects of the threat to U.S. interests are particular to the region: the frightening spread of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery; the ongoing challenge to the international system posed by Iraq; and, perhaps most of all, the reluctance that many U.S. allies in the region exhibit to confront their own religious militants.In this volume, key U.S. and Middle East decision makers, academics, and journalists discuss important themes such as the common interests of regional states in cooperating against terrorism, the different strategies adopted by regimes in confronting their Islamist challenges, the impact of September 11 events on the Israeli-Palestinian arena, the problems and prospects of maintaining the antiterror coalition, and the role of democracy as an antidote to the region\u2019s ills.",

Then Willard (Tipp) Freeman (D-Ponca City) is thrown from a hotel window in downtown Oklahoma City. Two more lawmakers are felled before Governor Buffalo Joe Hayman can scream for justice. As always when something is fishy in the Great State of Oklahoma, Joe orders the lieutenant governor, the One-eyed Mack, to find out who's responsible.If that was all Mack had to do, it would probably be easy. But the usual suspects are up to their usual tricks. C., the one-eared director of the OBI (Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation), and Buffalo Joe are at each other's throats. Mack's wife, Jackie, may have become irreversibly tetched by the run-away success of JackieMart, her nationwide chain of drive-through convenience stores. Their son, Tommy Walt, needs Mack's help in developing a recycling scheme that will change the way business is done in Oklahoma, America, and the world. And the curator of the Museum of the Cherokee Strip, Sandra Faye Parsons, keeps trying to use the mummy of John Wilkes Booth to get Mack to strip for her!In Jim Lehrer's sixth One-eyed Mack mystery, his sharp eye for satire glints as strongly as ever. By the final chapters of Fine Lines, readers everywhere will know why the people of Oklahoma couldn't find themselves a better, more charming lieutenant governor than the One-eyed Mack.",

Fill one with main-dish fixins and the others with go-alongs. Do it in the morning--or between work and after-school events.  Come home to richly-flavored, ready-to-serve food.  Slow cookers are having a comeback. With good reason. They are friends on a day of running errands. They allow easy entertaining with no last-minute preparation. And vegetarians won't find a better way to work with dried beans.  Slow cookers are gentle with the food budget--less expensive ingredients flourish in their slow, moist heat.  Fix-It and Forget-It offers the range of recipes slow cookers do well: Appetizers and Snacks, Soups and Stews, Main Dishes (with and without meat), Vegetables and Go-Alongs, Desserts and Beverages.  Bring an element of simplicity--and quality--to your pressured life! Let your slow cooker work for you.",
