As Sue struggles to enlarge a vision of swarming bees into a novel, and Ann ponders the classic question of what to do with her life, this modern-day Demeter and Persephone explore an array of inspiring figures and sacred sites.

All you need to do is set foot outside your door to see that bad manners are taking over everywhere. People are yakking on cell phones in restaurants, even at church. Folks in carpools wear enough cologne to make our eyes bleed. Complete strangers think it's OK to rub a pregnant lady's belly. Passengers abuse flight attendants, family outings to the ball park are ruined by rowdy drunks . . . a congressman heckled the President of the United States. Well, Whoopi Goldberg has noticed all this and more and asked herself, \"Is it just me?\" Unleashing her trademark irreverence and humor, her new book of observations takes a funny and excruciatingly honest look at how a loss of civility is messing with the quality of life for all of us. So if your pet peeve is folks who talk in movie theaters like it was their living room, or if you get bugged by people clipping their nails and performing other personal hygiene next to you on the bus, or if you cringe when \"please\" and \"thank you\" get replaced by \"gimme\" and \"huh\" . . . you have found a kindred spirit. Because Whoopi has witnessed the growing disrespect and rudeness in our lives and realized she is not alone. And, as you'll discover in these pages, neither are you.",

It was nine days before Christmas 1998, and thirty-two-year-old Ronda Reynolds was getting ready to travel from Seattle to Spokane to visit her mother and brother and grandmother before the holidays. Ronda\u2019s second marriage was dissolving after less than a year, her career as a pioneering female Washington State Trooper had ended, but she was optimistic about starting over again. \"I\u2019m actually looking forward to getting on with my life,\" she told her mother earlier the night before. \"I just need a few days with you guys.\" Barb Thompson, Ronda\u2019s mother, who had met her daughter\u2019s second husband only once before, was just happy that Ronda was coming home. At 6:20 that morning, Ron Reynolds called 911 and told the dispatcher his wife was dead. She had committed suicide, he said, although he hadn\u2019t heard the gunshot and he didn\u2019t know if she had a pulse. EMTs arrived, detectives arrived, the coroner\u2019s deputy arrived, and a postmortem was conducted. Lewis County Coroner Terry Wilson, who neither visited the death scene nor attended the autopsy, declared the manner of Ronda\u2019s death as \"undetermined.\" Over the next eleven years, Coroner Wilson would change that manner of death from \"undetermined\" to \"suicide,\" back to \"undetermined\"\u2014and then back to \"suicide\" again. But Barb Thompson never for one moment believed her daughter committed suicide. Neither did Detective Jerry Berry or ballistics expert Marty Hayes or attorney Royce Ferguson or dozens of Ronda\u2019s friends. For eleven grueling years, through the ups and downs of the legal system and its endless delays, these people and others helped Barb Thompson fight to strike that painful word from her daughter\u2019s death certificate. On November 9, 2009, a precedent-setting hearing was held to determine whether Coroner Wilson\u2019s office had been derelict in its duty in investigating the death of Ronda Reynolds. Veteran true-crime writer Ann Rule was present at that hearing, hoping to unbraid the tangled strands of conflicting statements and mishandled evidence and present all sides of this haunting case and to determine, perhaps, what happened to Ronda Reynolds, in the chill still of that tragic December night.",

        "Authors": "By Bingham, Sara and Villanueva, Jamie (ILT)",
        "Description": "This first edition (9780778801634) is replaced by the second edition (9780778804512).    Communicate with babies -- even before they can speak.    Before a baby can talk and before a toddler can say completely understandable words, they have important things to say. Babies and children are often more interested in connecting with parents or other caregivers than playing with their toys.    The Baby Signing Book uses American Sign Language, which is ideal for babies and toddlers because:  The ability of babies to understand what they see develops well before their ability to understand what they hear.  The ability of a baby to speak develops between the ages of 12 and 18 months, while the ability to use American Sign Language develops between 6 and 12 months.  Babies understand what they see            much earlier than typically expected, and are able to sign well before they are able to talk.    The Baby Signing Book teaches parents 300 developmentally appropriate American Sign Language signs. With clear instructions for every sign, memory aid, song and game, the learning in this program is easy to follow and, most important, fun for all. Language milestones are charted throughout the book so progress can be charted. The book also features a variety of visual highlights that emphasize key concepts and interesting tips.    Adults can customize a program according to the family's needs and aspirations. With the dictionary of 300 symbols, this handbook is clearly the most user-friendly and comprehensive baby signing book available.",

        "Authors": "By Mattera, Jason",
        "Description": "In 2008, Barack Obama lobotomized a generation. For an entire year, otherwise clear-thinking members of the most affluent, over-educated, information-drenched generation in American history fell prey to the most expensive, hi-tech, laser-focused marketing assault in presidential campaign history. Twitter messages were machine-gunned to cell phones at mach speed. Facebook and MySpace groups spread across the Internet like digital fire. YouTube videos featuring celebrities ricocheted across the globe and into college students\u2019 in-boxes with devastating regularity. All the while, the mega-money-raising engine whirred like a slot machine stuck on jackpot. The result: an unthinking mass of young voters marched forward to elect the most radical and untested president in U.S. history. Recognized as one of the country\u2019s top young conservative activists by Human Events, Jason Mattera created an internet sensation with ambush video interviews that exposed clueless young liberals and cunning Democratic officials. Now he reveals the jaw-dropping lengths Barack Obama and his allies in Hollywood, Washington, and Academia went to in order to transform a legion of iPod-listening, MTV-watching followers into a winning coalition that threatens to become a long-lasting political realignment. Obama Zombies uncovers the true, behind-the-scenes story of the methods and tactics the Obama campaign unleashed on youth culture. Through personal interviews and meticulous original research, Mattera explains why conservatism\u2019s future rests upon jolting the young masses from their slumber, yanking out their earphones, and sparking a countercultural conservative battle against the rise of the ignorant Left. The lesson from 2008 is crystal clear: When true conservatives run away, Obama zombies come out to play.",

        "Title": "Extraordinary, Ordinary People: A Memoir of Family",
        "Authors": "By Rice, Condoleezza",
        "Description": "Condoleezza Rice has excelled as a diplomat, political scientist, and concert pianist.  Her achievements run the gamut from helping to oversee the collapse of communism in Europe and the decline of the Soviet Union, to working to protect the country in the aftermath of 9-11, to becoming only the second woman - and the first black woman ever -- to serve as Secretary of State.  But until she was 25 she never learned to swim. Not because she wouldn't have loved to, but because when she was a little girl in Birmingham, Alabama, Commissioner of Public Safety Bull Connor decided he'd rather shut down the city's pools than give black citizens access. Throughout the 1950's, Birmingham's black middle class largely succeeded in insulating their children from the most corrosive effects of racism, providing multiple support systems to ensure the next generation would live better than the last.  But by 1963, when Rice was applying herself to her fourth grader's lessons, the situation had grown intolerable.  Birmingham was an environment where blacks were expected to keep their head down and do what they were told -- or face violent consequences. That spring two bombs exploded in Rice\u2019s neighborhood amid a series of chilling Klu Klux Klan attacks.  Months later, four young girls lost their lives in a particularly vicious bombing. So how was Rice able to achieve what she ultimately did? Her father, John, a minister and educator, instilled a love of sports and politics.  Her mother, a teacher, developed Condoleezza\u2019s passion for piano and exposed her to the fine arts.  From both, Rice learned the value of faith in the face of hardship and the importance of giving back to the community.  Her parents\u2019 fierce unwillingness to set limits propelled her to the venerable halls of Stanford University, where she quickly rose through the ranks to become the university\u2019s second-in-command.  An expert in Soviet and Eastern European Affairs, she played a leading role in U.S. policy as the Iron Curtain fell and the Soviet Union disintegrated.  Less than a decade later, at the apex of the hotly contested 2000 presidential election, she received the exciting news \u2013 just shortly before her father\u2019s death \u2013 that she would go on to the White House as the first female National Security Advisor.   As comfortable describing lighthearted family moments as she is recalling the poignancy of her mother\u2019s cancer battle and the heady challenge of going toe-to-toe with Soviet leaders, Rice holds nothing back in this remarkably candid telling. This is the story of Condoleezza Rice that has never been told, not that of an ultra-accomplished world leader, but of a little girl \u2013 and a young woman -- trying to find her place in a sometimes hostile world and of two exceptional parents, and an extended family and community, that made all the difference.",

        "Title": "Big Girls Don't Cry: The Election that Changed Everything for American Women",
        "Authors": "By Traister, Rebecca",
        "Description": "REBECCA TRAISTER, whose coverage of the 2008 presidential election for Salon confirmed her to be a gifted cultural observer, offers a startling appraisal of what the campaign meant for all of us. Though the election didn\u2019t give us our first woman president or vice president, the exhilarating campaign was nonetheless transformative for American women and for the nation. In Big Girls Don\u2019t Cry, her electrifying, incisive and highly entertaining first book, Traister tells a terrific story and makes sense of a moment in American history that changed the country\u2019s narrative in ways that no one anticipated.It was all as unpredictable as it was riveting: Hillary Clinton\u2019s improbable rise, her fall and her insistence (to the consternation of her party and the media) on pushing forward straight through to her remarkable phoenix flight from the race; Sarah Palin\u2019s attempt not only to fill the void left by Clinton, but to alter the very definition of feminism and claim some version of it for conservatives; liberal rapture over Barack Obama and the historic election of our first African-American president; the media microscope trained on Michelle Obama, harsher even than the one Hillary had endured fifteen years earlier. Meanwhile, media women like Katie Couric and Rachel Maddow altered the course of the election, and comedians like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler helped make feminism funny. What did all this mean to the millions of people who were glued to their TV sets, and for the country, its history and its future? As Traister sees it, the 2008 election was good for women. The campaign for the presidency reopened some of the most fraught American conversations\u2014about gender, race and generational difference, about sexism on the left and feminism on the right\u2014difficult discussions that had been left unfinished but that are crucial to further perfecting our union. The election was also catalytic, shaping the perspectives of American women and men from different generations and backgrounds, altering the way that all of us will approach questions of women and power far into the future. When Clinton cried, when Palin reached for her newborn at the end of a vice presidential debate, when Couric asked a series of campaign-ending questions, the whole country was watching women\u2019s history\u2014American history\u2014being made. Throughout, Traister weaves in her own experience as a thirtysomething feminist sorting through all the events and media coverage\u2014vacillating between Clinton and Obama and forced to face tough questions about her own feminism, the women\u2019s movement, race and the different generational perspectives of women working toward political parity some ninety years after their sex was first enfranchised. It was a time of enormous change, and there is no better guide through that explosive, infuriating, heartbreaking and sometimes hilarious year than Rebecca Traister. Big Girls Don\u2019t Cry offers an enduring portrait of dramatic cultural and political shifts brought about by this most historic of American contests.",

Rather than joining the throngs who are asking, When will this economic crisis be over? Jim Wallis says the right question to ask is How will this crisis change us? The worst thing we can do now, Wallis tells us, is to go back to normal. Normal is what got us into this situation. We need a new normal, and this economic crisis is an invitation to discover what that means. Some of the principles Wallis unpacks for our new normal are . . .\u2022 Spending money we don\u2019t have for things we don\u2019t need is a bad foundation for an economy or a family.\u2022 It\u2019s time to stop keeping up with the Joneses and start making sure the Joneses are okay.\u2022 The values of commercials and billboards are not the things we want to teach our children.\u2022 Care for the poor is not just a moral duty but is critical for the common good.\u2022 A healthy society is a balanced society in which markets, the government, and our communities all play a role.\u2022 The operating principle of God\u2019s economy says that there is enough if we share it.\u2022 And much, much more . . .In the pages of this book, Wallis provides us with a moral compass for this new economy\u2014one that will guide us on Wall Street, Main Street, and Your Street.Embracing a New Economy Getting back to \"the way things were\" is not an option. It is time we take our economic uncertainty and use it to find some moral clarity. Too often we have been ruled by the maxims that greed is good, it\u2019s all about me, and I want it now. Those can be challenged only with some of our oldest and best values\u2014enough is enough, we are in it together, and thinking not just for tomorrow but for future generations. Jim Wallis shows that the solution to our problems will be found only as individuals, families, friends, churches, mosques, synagogues, and entire communities wrestle with the question of values together.",

Since the moment he jumped out of a hospital bed and forced his way through nurses and cords to take a simple shower, Captain Scotty Smiley has climbed Mount Rainier, won an ESPY as Best Outdoor Athlete, surfed, skydived, become a father, earned an MBA from Duke, taught leadership at West Point, commanded an army company, and won the MacArthur Leadership Award.

Instead of darling and compliant rosy-cheeked children and an adorably tolerant husband ready to go along with zany shenanigans, most women are faced with: kids who view family outings with all the enthusiasm of hardened inmates forced to bust rocks in roadside Alabama and a man who would trade every last one of her kooky ideas for a just a teeny little bit more sex and a hot meal on the table at six. Sheri Lynch, co-cost of radio's syndicated Bob & Sheri, is a superb humorist of modern marriage, mores, and motherhood. Her Hello, My Name Is Mommy decoded the pitfalls of pregnancy and trials of new motherhood. Be Happy or I'll Scream taps into the wackier, even more wonderful world of family and husband management, kid-raising, and sanity maintenance in the face of it all.  Her take on what life is really like inside a marriage-as opposed to what it looks like on the holiday card version of same-will ring both wacky and true to any woman who was ever foolish enough to dream of the perfect marriage and family.",

        "Description": "\"History at its best is about telling stories---stories about people who lived before, about events in the past that create the contours of the present. In the hands of a gifted storyteller. a memoir becomes more than a chronicle of the writer's life. It becomes the history of a time and a place. So it is with this magnificent memoir---one of the most eloquent, moving, and insightful memories I have ever read.\"---Doris Kearns Goodwin. Pulitzer Prize---winning historian and author of Team of Rivals\"A riveting, inspiring memoir of an at once singular and representative American family. Norris takes us on a painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. She relies on her formidable skills as an investigative reporter to unearth shocking family secrets kept from her by her father and mother when she was growing up. Feeling hurt and betrayed, she learns that their lack of forthrightness allowed her to rise in a country haunted by its racial past. Powerful and tender. The Grace of Silence reveals our human complexity in exemplary fashion.\"---Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute. Harvard University, and author of Colored People\"Norris takes us on a riveting personal journey from north to south and back again through the tangled landscape of race in America---and teaches anew about the pain and possibilities of our past and future.\"---Tom Brokaw, author of the Greatest Generation and Boom!\"A soaring memoir that pays powerful tribute to the quiet and dignified heroes among us, Norris's remarkable family and her courageous journey to tell their story create an inspiring portrait of America that will stay with you forever. I loved this book.\"---Dave Isay, founder of Story CorpsIn the Wake of talk of a \"postracial\" America upon Barack Obama's ascension as president of the United States, Michele Norris, cohost of National Public Radio's flagship program All Things Considered, set out to write, through original reporting, a book about \"the hidden conversation\" on race that is unfolding nation-wide. She would, she thought, base her book on the frank disclosures of others on the subject, but she was soon disabused of her presumption when forced to confront the fact that \"the conversation\" in her own family had not been forthright.Norris unearthed painful family secrets that compelled her to question her own self-understanding: from her father's shooting by a Birmingham police officer weeks after his discharge from the navy at the conclusion of World War II to her maternal grand-mother's peddling pancake mix as an itinerant Aunt Jemima to white farm women in the Midwest, In what became a profoundly personal and bracing journey into her family's past, Norris traveled from her childhood home in Minneapolis to her ancestral roots in the Deep South to explore the reasons for the \"things left unsaid\" by her father and mother when she was growing up, the better to come to terms with her own identity. Along the way she discovered how her character was forged by both revelation and silence.Extraordinary for Norris's candor in examining her own racial legacy and what it means to be an American, The Grace of Silence is also informed by rigorous research in its evocation of time and place, scores of interviews with ordinary folk, and wise observations about evolving attitudes, at once encouraging and disturbing, toward race in America today. For its particularity and universality, it is powerfully moving, a tour de force.",

Trapped in this dangerous and desperate world, she suffered the brutality and horrors of human trafficking\u2014rape, torture, deprivation\u2014until she managed to escape with the help of a French aid worker.

She has orchestrated raids on brothels and rescued sex workers, some as young as five and six; she has built shelters, started schools, and founded an organization that has so far saved more than four thousand women and children in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. Her memoir will leave you awestruck by her tenacity and courage and will renew your faith in the power of an individual to bring about change.To learn more about how you can help fight human trafficking, visit the foundation\u2019s website: www.somaly.org.",

According to the last starving servants still clinging to life inside the castle walls, the Black Demon was looking for gold belonging to Garron's brother Arthur. Among his remaining servants is the enigmatic Merry, the bastard child of the castle's priest. Garron quickly realizes that she is much more than a servant: She reads and writes and makes lists, just as he does. Together they bring Wareham back to its former splendor. But this is only the beginning. Did Arthur have a cache of gold? Who is the Black Demon? And the biggest question of all: Who is Merry?",

Then Gwen\u2019s veterinarian called with a story about a three-week-old eyeless kitten who\u2019d been abandoned. It was love at first sight.Everyone warned that Homer would always be an \u201cunderachiever.\u201d But the kitten nobody believed in quickly grew into a three-pound dynamo with a giant heart who eagerly made friends with every human who crossed his path. Homer scaled seven-foot bookcases with ease, survived being trapped alone for days after 9/11 in an apartment near the World Trade Center, and even saved Gwen\u2019s life when he chased off an intruder who broke into their home in the middle of the night. But it was Homer\u2019s unswerving loyalty, his infinite capacity for love, and his joy in the face of all obstacles that transformed Gwen\u2019s life. And by the time she met the man she would marry, she realized that Homer had taught her the most valuable lesson of all: Love isn\u2019t something you see with your eyes.

Unlike leading nonprofit agencies and institutions, we too often fail to convince potential givers that their gifts will have impact and significance. In this book, Christopher lays out the main reasons for this failure to capture the imagination of potential givers, including our frequent failure simply to ask. Written with the needs of pastors and stewardship teams in mind, Not Your Parents\u2019 Offering Plate provides immediate, practical guidance to all who seek to help God\u2019s people be better stewards of their resources.

        "Description": "Huck is a page-turning, unforgettable true story of the tenacity of one small dog, the unexpected, extraordinary kindness of strangers, and a family\u2019s devotion to each other.  Michael was four when his relentless campaign for a dog began. At seven he made a PowerPoint presentation, \u201cMy Dog,\u201d with headings like \u201cA Childhood Without a Dog is a Sad Thing.\u201d His parents, Janet and Rich, were steadfast; bringing a dog into their fast-paced New York City lives was utterly impractical. However, on a trip to Italy, a chance happening leads Janet to reconsider, a decision then hastened by a diagnosis of breast cancer.  Janet decides the excitement of a new puppy would  be the perfect antidote to the strain on the family of months of arduous treatments for her illness. The prospect of a new puppy would be an affirmation of life, a powerful talisman for them all. On Thanksgiving weekend, soon after the grueling months of treatments are over, Huck, a sweet, mischievous, red-haired, toy poodle joins the family and wins everyone\u2019s heart. A few months later the family ventures to baseball\u2019s spring training, leaving Huck with Janet\u2019s sister in Ramsey, New Jersey.  Barely twenty-four hours into the trip, Janet receives the dreaded phone call: Huck has slipped through the backyard fence and run away.  Broken-hearted and frantic, the family catches the first plane to New Jersey to begin a search for their lost puppy. It is a race against time, for little Huck is now lost in an area entirely unfamiliar to him, facing the threat of bears and coyotes, swamps and freezing temperatures, rain and fast cars.  Moved by the family\u2019s plight, strangers \u2013 from school children to townspeople to the police lieutenant \u2013 join the search, one that proves to be an unyielding test of determination and faith. Touching and warm-hearted, Huck is a spirit-lifting story about resilience, the generosity of strangers, and hope.",

        "Description": "Featuring sixty black-and-white photographs of old dogs shot by Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning photographer Michael S. Williamson and narrated by Washington Post staffer and columnist Gene Weingarten, this is a perfect collection for dog lovers that celebrates \u201cman\u2019s best friend.\u201dAnyone who has ever loved an old dog will love Old Dogs. In this collection of profiles and photographs, Weingarten and Williamson document the unique appeal of man's best friend in his or her last, and best, years.   This book is a tribute to every dog who has made it to that time of life when the hearing and eyesight begin to go, when the step becomes uncertain, but when other, richer traits ripen and coalesce. It is when a dog attains a special sort of dignity and a charm all his own.   If you've known a favorite old dog, you'll find him or her on these pages. Your dog might go by a different name and have a different shape, but you'll recognize him or her by the look in an eye or the contours of a life story. There is the dog who thinks he is a house cat; the herder, the fetcher, the punk and the peacock, the escape artist, the demolition artist, the patrician, the lovable lout, the amiable dope, the laughable clown, the schemer, the singer, the daredevil, the diplomat, the politician, the gourmand, and the thief. Plus, as a special bonus, you will find the first Latvian elkhounds ever photographed.   Old Dogs is a glorious gift book and a fitting tribute to that one dog you can't ever forget.",

After years of training, Saleem operatedin successful terror campaigns funded by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and wealthy oil sheikhs.

Gabriel challenges our western and politically-correct notions about Islam, demonstrating why radical Islam is so deadly and how we can halt its progress.Brigitte Gabriel speaks her mind:*Fundamentalist Islam is a religion rooted in 7th century teachings that are fundamentally opposed to democracy and equality.*Radical Islamists are utterly contemptuous of all \"infidels\" (non-Muslims) and regard them as enemies worthy of death.*Madrassas in America are increasing in number, and they are just one part of a growing radical Islamic army on US soil.*Radical Islam exploits the US legal system and America's protection of religion to spread its hatred for western values.*America must organize a unified voice that says \"enough\" to political correctness, and demands that government officials and elected representatives do whatever is necessary to protect us.Brigitte Gabriel has fearlessly faced down critics, death threats, and political correctness, and is one of the most sought after terrorism experts in the world. They Must Be Stopped is her clarion call to action. Gabriel thoroughly addresses the historical and religious basis of radical Islam, its frightening encroachment into societies around the world, and its abuses of democracy in the name of religion.",
