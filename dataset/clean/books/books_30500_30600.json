        "Title": "Beyond Tuesday Morning (September 11 Series #2)",
        "Authors": "By Kingsbury, Karen",
        "Description": "The hope-filled sequel to the bestselling One Tuesday Morning In this new novel by Karen Kingsbury, three years have passed since the terrorist attacks on New York City. Jamie Bryan, widow of a firefighter who lost his life on that terrible day, has found meaning in her season of loss by volunteering at St. Paul\u2019s, the memorial chapel across the street from where the Twin Towers once stood. Here she meets a daily stream of people touched by the tragedy, including two men with whom she feels a connection. One is a firefighter also changed by the attacks, the other a police officer from Los Angeles. But as Jamie gets to know the police officer, she is stunned to find out that he is the brother of Eric Michaels, the man with the uncanny resemblance to Jamie\u2019s husband, the man who lived with her for three months after September 11. Eric is the man she has vowed never to see again. Certain she could not share even a friendship with his brother, Jamie shuts out the police officer and delves deeper into her work at St. Paul\u2019s. Now it will take the persistence of a tenacious man, the questions from her curious young daughter, and the words from her dead husband\u2019s journal to move Jamie beyond one Tuesday morning. \u201cJamie Bryan took her position at the far end of the Staten Island Ferry, pressed her body against the railing, eyes on the place where the Twin Towers once stood. She could face it now, every day if she had to. The terrorist attacks had happened, the World Trade Center had collapsed, and the only man she\u2019d ever loved had gone down with them. Late fall was warmer than usual, and the breeze across the water washed over Jamie\u2019s face. If she could do this, if she could make this journey three times a week while Sierra was in school, then she could convince herself to get through another long, dark night. She could face the empty place in the bed beside her, face the longing for the man who had been her best friend, the one she\u2019d fallen for when she was only a girl.\u201d",

Europe is modernizing, and the sultan of the Ottoman Empire feels he has no choice but to follow suit. But just as he's poised to announce sweeping political change, a wave of murders threatens the fragile balance of power in his court. Who is behind the killings? Deep in the Abode of Felicity, the most forbidden district of Topkapi Palace, the sultan - ruler of the Black Sea and the White, ruler of Rumelia and Mingrelia, lord of Anatolia and Ionia, Romania and Macedonia, Protector of the Holy Cities, steely rider through the realms of bliss - announces, \"Send for Yashim.\"Leading us through the palace's luxurious seraglios and Istanbul's teeming streets, Yashim places together the clues. He is not alone. He depends on the wisdom of a dyspeptic Polish ambassador, a transsexual dancer, and the Creole-born queen mother. He manages to find sweet salvation in the arms of another man's wife (this is not your everyday eunuch!). And he introduces us to the Janissaries. For four hundred years, they were the empire's elite soldiers. But they grew too powerful, and ten years earlier the sultan had them crushed. Are the Janissaries staging a brutal comeback? And if they are, how can they be stopped without throwing Istanbul into political chaos?",

And Lieutenant Colonel Nat Serling's investigation into Walden's career could help revive his own. He'd been a rising star in the war, but his command of a raid that accidentally fired on its own men has destroyed confidence in him. Now he has the chance to show what kind of job he can do with a delicate mission.Soon Serling discovers that this investigation is far from routine: he finds soldiers wounded more than just physically, stories that don't jibe, mysterious lapses of memory. He must navigate the codes of silence, honor, and loyalty to uncover the truth about the Captain's death - a truth that could destroy Walden's reputation but save Serling's career.",

Here she creates one of the most realistic portraits of a marriage in recent fiction, a tale of the nineties told with shocking authenticity. In it we are privy to the secret life of one outwardly perfect family, we hear the whispers about what goes on behind their closed doors, and we experience the triumph that comes when one person dares to tell the truth.It can happen in the best of families - even the Fergusons. When Lynn and Robert first meet, she is a bright, open-faced twenty-year-old; he is handsome, a little older, a charming young executive who is already rising fast in one of America's top corporations. From the start, they are deeply in love, thrilled by the discovery of their mutual desire. It is only on their honeymoon that the gold begins to tarnish when Robert's anger erupts into a physical attack, one Lynn blames on herself, for, after all, Robert is the love of her life. With a lovely home in an exclusive Connecticut community, the Fergusons are living the ultimate American Dream - a picture-perfect marriage, two beautiful children, parties at the country club, and wonderful friends. Yet Lynn, a devoted mother and model corporate wife, has never been able to piece together all the parts of her husband's past - his failed first marriage, and the son he never discusses. Somewhere in those mysterious years may be the key to understanding the violence that is tearing her family apart. But not even to their closest friends can Lynn bear to reveal what is really going on in the Ferguson household, the lies she has been telling, the pain she sees in her children's eyes, and the family secrets that are about to explode in a shattering and unforgettable climax.Written with extraordinary sensitivity and intelligence, whispers brings Belva Plain to a new level as an author. Holding a mirror up to modern life, she has written an inspiring and compelling story about a family's heartbreak, a woman's courage - and about a subject too long discussed only in whispers.",

But now Cussler takes an extraordinary leap, with one of his most remarkable villains ever.  Genghis Khan-the greatest conqueror of all time, who, at his peak, ruled an empire that stretched from the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea. His conquests are the stuff of legend, his tomb a forgotten mystery. Until now.  When Dirk Pitt is nearly killed rescuing an oil survey team from a freak wave on Russia's Lake Baikal, it appears a simple act of nature. When the survey team is abducted and Pitt's research vessel nearly sunk, however, it's obvious there's something more sinister involved. All trails lead to Mongolia, and a mysterious mogul who is conducting covert deals for supplying oil to the Chinese while wreaking havoc on global oil markets utilizing a secret technology. The Mongolian harbors a dream of restoring the conquests of his ancestors, and holds a dark secret about Genghis Khan that just might give him the wealth and power to make that dream come true.  From the frigid lakes of Siberia to the hot sands of the Gobi Desert, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino find intrigue, adventure, and peril while collecting clues to the mysterious treasure of Xanadu. But first, they must keep the tycoon from murder-and the unleashing of a natural disaster of calamitous proportions. Filled with breathtaking suspense and brilliant imagination, his new novel is yet further proof that when it comes to adventure writing, nobody beats Clive Cussler.",

The amount of money spent on treatments and products in these areas is staggering, yet we still know little about their efficacy.Adhering to the same high standards of investigation used by mainstream medical science, Jane Brody, Denise Grady, and the reporters of The New York Times take a hard look at the products, the research -- and the scams. They reveal the facts about unregulated dietary supplements, interactions between herbal and prescription medicines, and the many theories about the power of the mind over physical ailments. They evaluate claims about popular remedies like echinacea, ginkgo, and St. John's wort, and review the increasing body of scientific data on alternative treatments, including critical government case studies.Contributors to this timely and authoritative guide include star writers of the health, science, and business pages of The New York Times, whose articles are prized by those seeking practical, reliable, well-researched reporting on vital health issues.",

        "Description": "Paul Kunkel, who toilet-trained his first cat while in college and who has continued to train his own and his friends' cats ever since, presents a foolproof, 21-Day-Program for teaching any litter-trained cat between the ages of 6 months and 10 years to use a toilet instead of a litter box. (Older cats can still be trained, but the process will probably take longer.) Requiring nothing more than magazines and/or newspapers, masking tape, heavy-duty plastic wrap, and a supply of fresh litter, the plan begins with you placing the box next to the toilet and, after gradually raising it to the height of the seat, ends with the cat--well, using it like any other member of the family. For life.Along the way, concerned owners learn why toilet-trained cats may be happier and healthier cats. In well-researched, fact-filled text, Kunkel traces the history and behavior of this barely domesticated animal and proves why the box is bad for cats; why many cats equate the smell of a litter box with danger; and why the fragrances, deodorants, dyes, and disinfectants found in most litters are detrimental to your pet's well-being.",

Carved on jewelry, tools, weapons, and inscribed on boundary stones and markers, runes served as signs and talismans in a mysterious time.Originally written in Anglo Saxon in the early Middle Ages, The Rune Poem gives us an alphabet verse for these mystical inscriptions. Transcribed here into graceful modern English by poet Jim Paul, this ancient work is illustrated with richly textured carvings and lustrous illuminations. A beautiful and startling evocation, enhanced with informative contemporary notes, The Rune Poem, with its timeless power, links us to ages past and provides a key through which we may understand these primal symbols.",

        "Description": "Clever dialogue, fast-paced repartee, and pithy epigrams abound in this sparkling Victorian comedy of manners. The first of Oscar Wilde's dramas, the 1892 play attests to the author's legendary reputation as a wit and keen observer of ironic situations. In Lady Windermere's Fan, Wilde offers a splendidly satirical view of society's obsessive regard for appearances rather than reality.A paragon of morality, Lady Windermere firmly rejects the company of anyone exhibiting even the slightest deviation from the social code. Suspecting her husband of a dalliance with Mrs. Erlynne, a woman of dubious reputation, Lady Windermere rashly decides to abandon her secure position for the seductive charms of Lord Darlington. The voice of caution arises from an unexpected source when the mysterious Mrs. Erlynne reveals the calamitous effects of her own disregard for duty and virtue, and she augments her advice with an act of self-sacrifice. By laying claim to Lady Windermere's telltale fan, the woman from outside society shows the model of social propriety the difference between true morality and its semblance.More than a century after the play's debut, the luster of its humorous quips, merry bon mots, and thought-provoking paradoxes remains undimmed. This modestly priced edition of Wilde's scintillating comic masterpiece will delight lovers of drama and literature.",

The stories are just as diverse as the families who tell them (a blended family featuring children from separate marriages, a couple with different cultural and ethical backgrounds, a single parent of twin boys, and a couple with different parenting techniques learning to compromise).Some of the Taoist principles used by these families include:*Do Not Think of Self.  Shows the rewards parents receive by making their children their number one priority.*The material is fleeting, the spiritual is everlasting. Demonstrates the rewards of caring for those in need.*Do Not Be Authoritarian.  Shows how to foster self-reliance and responsibility in children while supporting their efforts, rather than controlling their every move.*Follow the middle road; it is the heart of knowing. Offers the benefits of parents being neither too permissive or too strict, but rather adjusting the rules for each child and each circumstance.There are many more valuable lessons in this special book which can be used by parents of all faiths to help guide their lives and those of their children.",

        "Authors": "By Fullbrook, Kate and Fullbrook, Edward",
        "Description": "He was France's best-known philosopher and chief arbiter of intellectual fashions during the postwar era. She was the most influential forerunner of today's feminist movement, who nonetheless seemed to live in the shadow of a great man. So goes one of the great cultural legends of our time. The only problem, as Kate and Edward Fullbrook point out in this beautifully written and meticulously researched portrait, is that it is wrong.Using newly available documentary evidence from diaries and letters, the authors shed astonishing new light on precisely who was the dominant partner in this relationship.By carefully tracing the dates of composition of some of Beauvoir's and Sartre's major works, the Fullbrooks demonstrate that Beauvoir, rather than Sartre, was the primary creative influence behind the couple's most celebrated ideas. In writing his acclaimed Being and Nothingness, Sartre acted primarily as an interpreter of a philosophical system already worked out in Beauvoir's novel, She Came To Stay.This astonishing discovery is at the heart of the Fullbrooks' absorbing account of Beauvoir's and Sartre's childhoods and their first twenty years together as a couple who changed the intellectual outlook of the world. By reworking the chronologies of the couple's writings and rereading old information in light of the new, the Fullbrooks arrive at a revisionary account of the couple's intimate lives, whose radical sexual freedom must now be understood as stemming from Beauvoir's rather than from Sartre's personal needs.The book provides decisive insights into the lives, literature, and ideas of two major figures on the modern cultural scene, and raises profound questions as to the psychological needs, sexual politics, and bad faith that led Beauvoir and Sartre to give misleading accounts of the inner workings of their relationship. Kate and Edward Fullbrook have written a book destined to be widely discussed and hotly debated.",
