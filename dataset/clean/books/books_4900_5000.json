        "Description": "Richard Paul Evans is one of the world's most beloved storytellers. Here, in his latest novel, he tells a love story about facing the greatest decision of all...choosing between the love for a child and romantic love.  When Eliana, still called Ellen by her close friends back in America, moved to Italy the future was bright with promise. Tuscany held magic in its sprawling vineyards, great food, and centuries of art. It was a life of the senses, perfect for a blossoming, talented young artist such as Eliana. Her family and friends back home all thought she had made the right choice in following her heart, and the man she fell in love with and married, back to his native country. In America, Eliana's story was that of a fairy tale.  But in Italy, in the small, rustic village nestled in the Chianti countryside, Eliana found her husband to be a very different man. Over time he distances himself from her, leaving Eliana to care for their young son, struggling with the asthma that threatens to take his life.  Although she longs for the romance she'd known in America, Eliana is happy as a mother and with the time she spends with her child; yet when fellow American Ross Story, a deeply thoughtful man with a mysterious passion for art, arrives at the same villa, a chance encounter causes Eliana and Ross to look at their lives anew. And with their discovery that individuals may change and grow, they can never forget that the bonds of family last forever.  In The Last Promise Richard Paul Evans spins a passionate, bittersweet tale about the fantastic joy and great sorrow life can throw our way.  Rich and complex as a vintage Chianti wine, The Last Promise is in the end an uplifting, all-too-human tale about the magnificent power of true love.",

Because a little over ten years ago Bob Nelson took the seeds of an idea and turned it into something indispensable for business. The idea? That it\u2019s not a raise that motivates an employee, and it\u2019s not a promotion\u2014what really sparks a person to perform are those intangible, unexpected gestures that signify real appreciation for a job well done. Now, after having worked with thousands of organizations in the years since 11001 Ways to Reward. . . was first published, Bob Nelson presents a second edition packed with hundreds of new ideas and examples of how companies are using rewards and recognitions to boost productivity and keep their valued employees happy. Airplane mechanics are rewarded with balloons and pinwheels. Another manager calls his employees\u2019 mothers and thanks them for raising such industrious children. There are ideas from the offbeat (The Margarita Award) to the company-wide (a quiet room) to the embarrassingly simple (a hand-written thank you note) to the wacky (the Laugh-a-Day challenge) to the formal (a two-week promotion to special assistant to the president). Each section includes no-cost rewards and low-cost rewards, both public and private, making this new edition an indispensable resource for making the person/achievement/reward equation work.",

Determined to bring the powerful Duvall down, Burke strikes at the attorney's most vulnerable spot: the gorgeous wife Duvall pampers but keeps prisoner, a woman whose love Pinkie will never have.Remy Duvall was destitute and at the mercy of New Orleans's streets before Duvall made her his trophy. When Burke strikes, taking Remy as his captive, it sets off a duel between the criminal lawyer and the ex-cop that explodes from the streets of the French Quarter and intensifies in the steamy swamps.For Burke, who is struggling with his own anguished spirit, his fight with Duvall is a matter of honor. But the one thing he could never have imagined is the passion that erupts between himself and Duvall's wife. As dozens of players - from the innocent to the corrupt - are drawn into the drama, Burke and Remy have one way out: through a desperate confrontation in the middle of Mardi Gras madness.",

        "Authors": "By Nixon, Richard Milhous",
        "Description": "Beyond Peace is a manifesto for a new America, written with visionary insight and a realistic idealism by the thirty-seventh president of the United States. Richard Nixon offers a new agenda for the United States as it defines its role in the complex post-Cold War era.The collapse of communism, he argues, has offered the United States a unique opportunity for achieving an American renewal. The ultimate test of a nation's character is not just how it responds to adversity in war, but how it meets and masters the challenge of peace: During the Cold War, we sought a peace with justice. If America is to remain a great nation, we now need a mission beyond peace.Nixon charts the course America should take in the future to ensure that the opportunities of this new era beyond peace are not lost. With his unrivaled experience in foreign affairs, he addresses the key issues facing the United States today: why the United States should continue to play the leading role on the world stage, and what our policies should be toward Russia, Europe, China, Japan, and the Middle East.Nixon's answers are informed by a depth of knowledge gained over many years as a statesman in the international arena. His intimate portraits of world leaders, past and present, offer us a bird's-eye view of leadership and international politics.Turning to America, the former President perceives a crisis of spirit that extends beyond foreign affairs. It manifests itself in crime, in education, in race relations, in a selective moralism, in a notion of rights without responsibility, and most of all in a corrosive entitlement mentality that he describes as \"one of the greatest threats to our fiscal health, our moral fiber, and our ability to renew our nation.\"This book challenges us to seek a goal higher than peace alone. It must be a mission that will unify and inspire the country without war, built on peace but able to transcend it.Beyond Peace is Richard Nixon's tenth - and possibly most provocative - book.",

        "Title": "Barbara Bush: A Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Bush, Barbara",
        "Description": "Barbara Bush is certainly among the most popular First Ladies ever to live in the White House. Politics aside, people worldwide have come to admire her wit, her candor and compassion, as well as her unswerving devotion to her husband and children.  In her memoir, Mrs. Bush for the first time gives readers a very private look at a life lived in the public eye for more than twenty-five years. She begins with a compelling portrait of her early years, including: growing up in Rye, New York, and meeting George Bush; life as a young bride and mother, moving far away from home to West Texas; and the almost unbearable pain of losing a child.  With contemporary American history as the backdrop, Mrs. Bush remembers the shock of learning that her fianc\u00e9 has been shot down in the Pacific during World War II; the disbelief when a black friend is refused service in a Southern restaurant in the 1950s; and the fear when she is caught in the middle of a student protest march in the 1960s.  She recounts her years in public life, from first moving to Washington when George Bush was elected to Congress; to her experience living in New York as the wife of the Ambassador to the United Nations and in China as wife of the U.S. envoy. She talks candidly about the ups and downs of three presidential campaigns and describes her role as the wife of the Vice President, culminating in the climactic White House years.  Drawing upon excerpts from her diary, which she has compiled for more than thirty years, Mrs. Bush takes us behind the scenes of the Persian Gulf conflict and the end of the Cold War. She talks about both the Bushes' struggle to overcome Graves' disease and how she faced the controversy that erupted at Wellesley College before her commencement speech.  Through the friendships she developed over the years with world leaders and their spouses, we meet and get to know the Gorbachevs, the Thatchers, the Mitterrands, the Mubaraks, and many others. And she tells us why she threw so much of her energy and compassion behind the important cause of making more Americans literate.  This memoir includes hundreds of the funny, often self-deprecating, and occasionally touching anecdotes for which Mrs. Bush is well known: surprising a rat while swimming in the White House pool; accidentally stomping on Boris Yeltsin's foot under the table during a state dinner; wearing a $29 pair of shoes for her husband's inaugural ball.  She also talks about the disappointments of the 1992 presidential campaign and the joys of rediscovering private life, including driving and cooking again for the first time in twelve years.  This is a warm and funny memoir that will charm Mrs. Bush's millions of admirers and earn her many more.",

Her husband of more than twenty years leaves her for a younger woman, her domineering mother dies, and her Atlanta clan scatters to the four winds. In a heartbeat Molly is set adrift. Devasting by her crumbling world, Molly takes refuge with a friend on Martha's Vineyard where she tries to come to terms with who she really is. After the summer season, Molly decides to stay on in this very different world, renting a small cottage on a remote up-island pond.As Molly's stay up island widens the distance between her and her old life in Atlanta, she lets go of her outworn notions of family and begins to become part of a strange -- and very real -- new family.  As the long Vineyard winter closes in, she braces herself for the search for renewal, identity, and strength, until the healing spring finally comes.",

They present a workable life plan \u2014accessible to everyone \u2014with these goals:  An optimally functioning brain in a sound body  Social support systems, with nurturing family and friends.  A multifaceted career and financial security.  The Longevity Strategy contains 31 practical, essential tactics that will develop and enhance your longevity potential.

I learned the hard way about the validity of the brain-body connection. The Longevity Strategy will make it a great deal easier for you to learn just what it means, too.\" \u2014Mike Wallace. \"Eloquent and vivid....You should read and adopt The Longevity Strategy. It could add years to your life.\" \u2014Daniel Tosteson, M.D. Dean Emeritus, Harvard Medical School. \"This delightful book shows you that a long healthy life is not a struggle to survive but a result of learning how to thrive. In easy-to-understand style, Mahoney and Restak translate the latest research into simple but important steps on how to live long and prosper. Unlike many books about aging, this one is not about bland diets and exhausting exercise; it's about learning how to love living.\" \u2014Paul Pearsall, Ph.D., New York Times bestselling author of Superimmunity, The Pleasure Prescription, and The Heart's Code. \"Superb . . . The Longevity Strategy reads like a Poor Richard's Almanac for the next millennium.

It may not enable us all to live 100 years, but it will help us get there. Most important, it will make the journey more rewarding.\" \u2014Leon Cooper, Ph.D.,winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, Professor and Director, Department of Physics and Neuroscience, Brown University.",

In Daybreak, perhaps her best and boldest work yet, she creates a living, breathing portrait of two families joined by a devastating childhood illness, yet divided by the politics of hatred and by the sons they love.In a doctor's office, a man and a woman sit stunned as the doctor speaks: Blood tests show without a shadow of a doubt that the son they love so dearly, and who is now dying, is not their child. Incredible as it seems, there must have been a mix-up in the hospital where he was born. Enduring the pain of Peter's death is a blow they must bear, but Margaret and Arthur Crawfield must also confront the realization that somewhere their biological child still lives. And although they know their search will tear apart another family, they feel compelled to look for the child who has grown up in another home.At the same time that the Crawfield family's world is turning upside down, Laura Rice - Mrs. Homer \"Bud\" Rice - looking around her elegant home at her beloved piano and ancestral portraits, realizes that after nineteen years of marriage she and her husband are fundamentally strangers. Bud Rice is respectable and respected in their small southern town, a good father to their two sons - bright, healthy Tom and eleven-year-old Timmy, who despite his chronic illness is a gift of joy. But Bud is the reason, Laura believes, for Tom's involvement with a campus group of terrifying bigots.Now the Crawfield and the Rice families will come together, putting emotions in upheaval and leaving lives forever changed. Somewhere in the days ahead a mother must tell her son that he was born to another woman and has another family. And no one foresees the events gathering force to explode with violence in the quiet town as a political candidate plays on prejudice and fear. Newly discovered truths rock a family already under siege in Daybreak's jolting, soul-shattering conclusion.Timely, provocative, and as real as today's headlines, Daybreak pulses with truth, takes our breath away with its extraordinary grace and eloquence, and brings vividly to life men and women so real they will long remain in our minds and hearts.",

        "Title": "Making It in America",
        "Authors": "By Hamrin, Robert and Jasinowski, Jerry",
        "Description": "Steadily, efficiently, almost without anyone's noticing, American industry has pulled off an astonishing turn-around in defiance of the dire media predictions of the \"death of manufacturing\" in the United States. Making It in America takes an up-close and in-depth look at the dramatic comeback that has made American manufacturing once again the industrial powerhouse of the world. It showcases ten paths to success followed by fifty top companies, such as Motorola, Xerox, and Whirlpool, that can help put any business - service or manufacturing - on its own customized path to success.What is really galvanizing the American business community today, according to authors Jerry Jasinowski and Robert Hamrin, is the dynamic tension between two powerful forces - a renewed commitment to fundamental values and a spirit of innovation to respond to the fast-changing needs of the marketplace. Jasinowski and Hamrin analyze the success stories of fifty companies at the forefront of this renaissance, including large yet constantly innovating companies such as Intel, Rubbermaid, and 3M as well as energetic smaller companies such as WillBurt, Cannondale, and Kingston Technology. (Each company's story concludes with a valuable and practical lesson.)The strategies devised by these companies were creative, bold, and highly effective: for example, Johnsonville Foods' employee empowerment initiative resulted in a 300 percent productivity increase (Path Number 1: Empower Employees): Dell Computer's commitment to customized service and \"pleased\" customers resulted in 70 percent of its buyers becoming repeat customers (Path Number 4: Exceed Customer Expectations); and Wadia Digital's focus on exports led to 70 to 80 percent of its revenues coming from exports in each of its first five years (Path Number 6: Go Global).",

        "Authors": "By D'Orso, Michael and Daschle, Thomas",
        "Description": "Tom Daschle, the Majority Leader of the historic 107th Senate, presents a candid insider\u2019s account of the workings of the U.S. government during two of the most tumultuous years in the nation\u2019s history.The 107th Congress faced a time like no other in the life of the nation. This was the era of the first presidential election to be decided by the United States Supreme Court, the fifty-fifty Senate, the horror of September 11, the anthrax attacks on media and the government (including Daschle\u2019s own office), the war on terrorism, corporate scandals that shook the economy, the inexorable move toward war with Iraq, and other dramatic events, all leading up to the historic midterm elections of 2002.Through it all, Senator Tom Daschle had, with the exception of the President, the most privileged view of these unfolding developments, both in front of and behind the closed doors of government. In Like No Other Time, Daschle offers a riveting account of his singular perspective on a time when the nation faced deadly and elusive external enemies and a level of domestic political contention rarely seen in American history. Senator Daschle is un-flinching in his impressions of the key political figures of our time from both parties. The result is an acutely perceptive assessment of how our government met\u2014and sometimes did not meet\u2014the challenges of a remarkable era.As it was during the years of the 107th Congress, the United States is once again at a critical and historic crossroads. Our choices, based on what we have learned from our recent past, will affect our future in profound ways. For Senator Daschle, the first and perhaps most important choice lies with what kind of representation and leadership we want in government. It is a choice between a political party with a core philosophical belief in the power of our collective will to confront these challenges through our government, and one dominated by a group of people who don\u2019t like and don\u2019t believe in government.",

        "Description": "\u201dHello, is Sarah Saffian there?\u201d asks the voice on the other end of the line. \u201dMy name is Hannah Morgan. I think I\u2019m your birth mother.\u201d So begins this powerful memoir by a young woman whose life changes dramatically when she receives a phone call from someone at once a stranger and her most intimate relation. Saffian\u2019s riveting story of painful self-discovery and newfound joy is unique in its reversal of the usual adoption narrative: here, the biological parents seek out the adoptee. Weaving together letters, journal entries, memories and relections, Saffian tells of her adoption, her adoptive mother\u2019s death six years later, and her upbringing in a loving family. She learns that her biological parents ended up marrying and having other children. She is thus faced with an entire family to whom she is genetically linked. Saffian\u2019s boldly honest account reaches a moving climax with their reunion, three years after the first phone call. Along the way, it raises thorny questions: What is a family? Can we have more than one? What is the line between parental concern and intrusion? Is it hypocritical to be a pro-choice adoptee? How do nature and nurture work together to form a person\u2019s identity? By turns earnest and playful, Ithica: A Daughter\u2019s Memoir of Being Found is sure to touch readers everywhere who have grappled with who they are.Sarah Saffian is a former reporter for the New York Daily News and has also written for the Village Voice, Interview, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, and Mirabella. She holds a B.A. from Brown University and an M.F.A. from Columbia University, and lives in her native New York City.",

        "Authors": "By Spence, Gerry",
        "Description": "The Making of a Country Lawyer is, like Clarence Darrow's The Story of My Life, the firsthand account of a beloved American attorney, a modern-day folk hero, a man who has devoted his life's work to the innocent and the damned. It is the riveting life story of a man born to missionary parents in a small Wyoming town in the virulent year of 1929. As a boy, Gerry Spence memorized Scripture in Sunday school, sold fresh bouquets of sweet peas door to door, herded sheep, and prowled the brothels of the Old West before he was fifteen. Tragically, it is also the haunting story of a deeply sensitive twenty-year-old son who learned one October morning that his God-fearing mother, seemingly depressed by her son's waywardness, had shot herself in the mouth with her husband's hunting rifle.More than any other single event, it was this tragedy that transformed the young Gerry Spence and fashioned his view of the world. It allowed him to become sensitive to the feelings of society's castoffs and prepared him to be a trial lawyer, eventually handling such landmark cases as the defense of Randy Weaver and the vindication of a dead plutonium plant worker named Karen Silkwood. The Making of a Country Lawyer not only follows Spence through law school (after graduating first in his class, he initially flunked the bar!), but also chronicles his years as a young prosecuting attorney, his first cases, his successful battle with alcoholism, and his consuming love affair with the woman who would save his life.",
