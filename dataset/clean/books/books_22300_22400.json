        "Description": "1. Jane Smiley's has lauded Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin for the artistry with which 'the power of brilliant analysis' is 'married to great wisdom of feeling.' How does The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton measure up to this standard? 2. Why does Ms. Smiley choose to describe Lidie's adventures as 'all-true' in the title of her novel? How would this work differ had the author chosen to turn her research into a narrative of nonfiction? 3. How does the novel authenticate as well as undermine myths about the North and the South in antebellum America? What traditional notions about frontier life, Westward expansion, and gender roles are confirmed or challenged? 4. After her husband's death, Lidie describes herself as a 'new person,' one she 'never desired or expected to be.' What is the relationship of her former self to her present self? What are the roles of chance, will, and ambition in the shaping of Lidie's life and character? 5. How does landscape function as a major character in the novel? 6. Of the Kansas Territory, Lidie writes, 'you could easily act one way one minute and another way the next minute.' What is the relationship between Lidie's character in the place she inhabits? How does the K.T.'s lack of definition make possible her discovery of self? 7. Lidie leads a life of adventure as well as a life of the mind. How do her physical endeavors compare to her contemplative pursuits--particularly storytelling--in terms of defining her character? 8. Ms. Smiley said that the novel was born of her desire to explore 'the intersection of ideology and violence in American life.' What connection does the novel suggest exists between these two extreme forms of expression? 9. In what ways do the sensibilities of the abolitionists mirror those of the slave-holders? How does each group use religion and history to justify its perspective on slavery? 10. How does the manner in which Lidie and Tom handle the vagaries and challenges of their relationship affect the progress of the social change they are attempting? What relationship exists between one's private life and public endeavours? 11. What purpose is served by introducing each chapter with an excerpt from Catherine Beecher's A Treatise on Domestic Economy, for the Use of Young Ladies at Home? 12. Experience and reflection help Lidie to move from ignorance and innocence to some sort of understanding of herself and others, yet confusion and ambivalence persist. What is the value of leaving the reader in the company of a conflicted character? 13. Smiley has said that the purpose of great literature is 'to help us face up to our responsibilities instead of enabling us to avoid them once again by lighting out for the territory.' Does her novel fulfill this purpose? How? 14. What connection lies between gender and violence? What is the significance of Lidie pursuing revenge disguised as a man? 15. What can the reader of Lidie Newton discern about morality and violence? Are the K.T. Free Staters justified in pursuing freedom through violence? What are the antecedents and repercussions of this issue in America? 16. Lidie Newton provides a novel perspective on antebellum America. What other historical events need telling from a woman's point of view? 17. Conjecture about the course of Lidie's adventures had Thomas not died. What are the repercussions of his presence and absence in her days? 18. How do the characters Papa and Helen Day contribute to the moral complexity of the novel? What is the significance of such complexity? Does the character of Lorna deepen or diminish it? 19. In an essay on The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Jane Smiley reproached Mark Twain for presenting a facile standard of heroism in his novel. She wrote: 'All you have to do to be a hero is acknowledge that your poor sidekick is human; you don't actually have to act in the interests of his humanity.' Does Lidie successfully act in the interest of Lorna's humanity? 20. 'A writer who does not passionately believe in the perfectibility of man has no dedication nor any membership in literature,' wrote John Steinbeck. What can one say about Ms. Smiley's perspective on such perfectibility given this novel? Does her work leave one with a sense of optimism? What is the novel's defining tone? 21. When presented with the opportunity to share the story of her experiences with Lorna, Lidie hesitates. 'I was disinclined to do this, and I pondered my disinclination at length,' she explains. 'Did I owe it to Lorna to tell her story to the world?...Mr. Thayer's friend candidly admitted one thing--Lorna herself would never benefit from my telling her story.' What is the value of Lidie telling Lorna's story? Of Ms. Smiley telling Lidie's? What can literature accomplish?",

        "Title": "The Intelligencer",
        "Authors": "By Silbert, Leslie",
        "Description": "On May 30, 1593, London's most popular playwright was stabbed to death. The royal coroner ruled that Christopher Marlowe was killed in self-defense, but historians have long suspected otherwise, given his role as an \"intelligencer\" in the queen's secret service.  In sixteenth-century London, Marlowe embarks on his final intelligence assignment, hoping to find his missing muse, as well as the culprits behind a high-stakes smuggling scheme.  In present-day New York, grad student turned private eye Kate Morgan is called in on an urgent matter. One of her firm's top clients, a London-based financier, has chanced upon a mysterious manuscript that had been buried for centuries -- one that someone, somewhere is desperate to steal. What secret lurks in those yellowed, ciphered pages? And how, so many years later, could it drive someone to kill?   As Kate sets off for England, she receives a second assignment. An enigmatic art dealer has made an eleven-million-dollar purchase from an Iranian intelligence officer. Is it a black-market antiquities deal, or something far more sinister? Like Marlowe, Kate moonlights as a spy -- her P.I. firm doubles as an off-the-books U.S. intelligence unit -- and she is soon caught like a pawn in a deadly international game. As The Intelligencer's interlocking narratives race toward a stunning collision, and Kate closes in on the truth behind Marlowe's sudden death, it becomes clear that she may have sealed a similar fate for herself.  Propelling us from the shadows of the sixteenth-century underworld to the glitter of Queen Elizabeth's court, from the dark corridors of a clandestine American op-center to the cliffs of Capri, The Intelligencer is at once a murder mystery, a tale of poetic inspiration, and a richly detailed foray into parallel worlds of espionage and political intrigue separated by centuries.",

The daughter of medical missionaries, she and her family were caught in a crucible of unspeakable hardship. In addition to pestilence and plague, there was the unstable political and military turmoil surrounding the Nationalist government, the Communists, and the Japanese invaders. These hazardous realities shaped Ruth Bell and her family, a family inured to difficulties, but buoyed up by their deep belief in God's abiding will.As the wife of Billy Graham, she stood alongside him at presidential inaugurations and at important events, yet often sat alone, hidden in the crowd at Billy's international and national rallies. Here we see how valuable Ruth's contribution to Billy's work has really been. She kept their home and family life intact, reached out to those searching for Christ at Billy's crusades, and brought spiritual guidance and comfort to the people around her - her handymen, local college students, and anyone who wrote, called, or showed up at her doorstep looking for hope. As a young girl, Ruth wanted to be a missionary, never dreaming that she would marry one of the greatest preachers our country has known, and bring Christ to people far away as well as right around the corner.",

At last the saga that captured the imagination of millions turns back in time to reveal its cloaked origins--the start of a legend--the story of STAR WARS. Based on the screenplay by George Lucas, this novel by master storyteller Terry Brooks probes the depths of one of the greatest tales of our time, providing rich detail and insight into the minds and motives of the characters--and shedding bold new light on Lucas' brilliant creation. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, an evil legacy long believed dead is stirring. Even the Jedi are caught by surprise, their attentions focused on the political unrest between the Trade Federation and the Republic. Now the dark side of the Force threatens to overwhelm the light, and only an ancient Jedi prophecy stands between hope and doom for the entire galaxy.On the desert world of Tatooine, far from the concerns of the Republic, a slave boy works by day and dreams by night--of being a Jedi Knight and one day traveling the stars to worlds he's only heard of in stories . . . of finding a way to win freedom from enslavement for himself and his beloved mother. His only hope lies in his extraordinary instincts and his strange gift for understanding the \"rightness\" of things, talents that allow him to be one of the best pod racers on the planet. In another part of the galaxy, the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, young Obi-Wan Kenobi, are charged with the protection of Amidala, the young Queen of Naboo, as she seeks to end the siege of her planet by Trade Federation warships. It is this quest that brings Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and the Queen's beautiful young handmaiden to the sand-swept streets of Tatooine and the shop where the slave boy Anakin Skywalker toils and dreams. And it is this unexpected meeting that marks the beginning of the drama that will become legend . . .",

In witty, vivid stories, Dr. Greenspan brings to life the major emotional milestones of these years, when children move from the shelter of the family to the harsh rivalries of  \"playground politics,\" and toward an independent self image. His empathy for the turmoil children bring home from school, and for the parents who try to help, is deep and reassuring.",

        "Description": "In this extraordinary fiction debut\u2014rich with love and betrayal, history and intellectual   passion\u2014two remarkable narratives converge on Easter Island, one of the most remote   places in the world. It is 1913. Elsa Pendleton travels from England to Easter Island   with her husband, an anthropologist sent by the Royal Geographical Society to study   the colossal moai statues, and her younger sister. What begins as familial duty for   Elsa becomes a grand adventure; on Easter Island she discovers her true calling.   But, out of contact with the outside world, she is unaware that World War I has been   declared and that a German naval squadron, fleeing the British across the South Pacific,   is heading toward the island she now considers home. Sixty years later, Dr. Greer   Farraday, an American botanist, travels to Easter Island to research the island\u2019s   ancient pollen, but more important, to put back the pieces of her life after the   death of her husband. A series of brilliant revelations brings to life the parallel   quests of these two intrepid young women as they delve into the centuries-old mysteries   of Easter Island. Slowly unearthing the island\u2019s haunting past, they are forced to   confront turbulent discoveries about themselves and the people they love, changing   their lives forever. Easter Island is a tour de force of storytelling that will   establish Jennifer Vanderbes as one of the most gifted writers of her generation.",
