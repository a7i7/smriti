        "Description": "The author of Great Wine Made Simple now adds great eating to her repertoire, showing how to enhance the flavor of even the most casual meals with winning wine selections.Most wine experts\u2019 advice on wine and food pairings consists of rigid rules that apply largely to haute cuisine and luxury wines. But, in her trademark accessible style, Andrea Immer now takes the mystery out of choosing wine for food\u2013and vice versa. Great Tastes Made Simple unlocks the secrets of basic food tastes\u2013sweet, earthy, savory, buttery, tart, and spicy\u2013and their particular wine affinities. Giving even ordinary meals extraordinary flavor, Immer shows readers how to bring the flavor alchemy of wine to everyday fare from burgers (with Zinfandel) to macaroni and cheese (with Rioja Crianza). She calls Pinot Grigio her \u201ctuna helper\u201d and likes barbecued brisket with Valpolicella. There\u2019s also plenty of more sophisticated eating, including smoked salmon and Riesling; asparagus hollandaise and Champagne; wild mushroom risotto and California Pinot Noir, to name a few upscale matches. In fact, there isn\u2019t a food or category of food\u2013including a panoply of cheeses, ethnic foods, and desserts\u2013for which Immer doesn\u2019t provide a match and the reasons why they work so well. Chart of mouthwatering pairings and an easy-to-use index make finding wonderful wine and food combinations a snap.Zeroing in on \u201cwine-loving food\u201d\u2013those flavors, textures, and cooking techniques that truly dazzle when paired with wine\u2013Immer demonstrates how to get the maximum enjoyment out of every food and wine encounter. A selection of twenty recipes\u2013Low Country Shrimp and Grits (think Chardonnay), Beet Risotto (Pinot Noir), Short Rib Rag\u00f9 (brawny reds), and Warm Chocolate Torte (Madeira)\u2013provides delicious examples of wine-loving dishes and cooking techniques that will become part of every wine-loving cook\u2019s repertoire. Invaluable in restaurant settings and at home, this innovative guide can make every meal a cause for celebration.",

Joe and John Henry are a lot alike. They both like shooting marbles, they both want to be firemen, and they both love to swim.  But there's one important way they're different: Joe is white and John Henry is black and in the South in 1964, that means John Henry isn't allowed to do everything his best friend is.  Then a law is passed that forbids segregation and opens the town pool to everyone. Joe and John Henry are so excited they race each other there...only to discover that it takes more than a new law to change people's hearts.  This stirring account of the \"Freedom Summer\" that followed the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 powerfully and poignantly captures two boys' experience with racism and their friendship that defies it.",

The author identifies Einstein's complex theories and makes clear why his ideas are still the basis of work by today's top physicists. He also reveals many of Einstein's inner complexities and eccentricities, exploring the personal and public controversies that followed him throughout his life.

For the next six years he immersed himself in the world of the Gershwins - Ira and the living memory of his brother George - cataloguing records, music, and memorabilia, and in the process discovering his true calling: ensuring the continued vitality of the American popular song.Nice Work If You Can Get It chronicles not only Feinstein's appreciation of the Gershwins, but also of Cole Porter, Harry Warren (42nd Street), Sammy Cahn, and Irving Berlin. Tommy Tune, Liza Minnelli, Rosemary Clooney, and other musical luminaries also make appearances in a volume full of anecdotes about every major figure in American musical theater and cabaret, with a firm grounding in the art of songwriting itself.",
