        "Authors": "By Botkin, Daniel B. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Forces of Change takes readers on an unforgettable tour of truly global proportions. In this single volume, more than 20 of the world's most innovative and visionary scientists, writers, and scholars -- including Stephen Jay Gould, John McPhee, Lynn Margulis, Daniel Botkin, and David Quammen -- illuminate the forces that define and continue to profoundly transform our planet and all of its inhabitants. Taken together, these essays represent a dramatic range of new views and understandings about nature that have emerged over the last century. Developed by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Geographic Society, Forces of Change brings together for the first time the matchless resources of two world-renowned institutions in order to present a bold new vision of the world, which stresses the diversity, interrelatedness, and interdependence of all natural phenomena. In this vision the Earth can be viewed as a grand network of life-supporting forces operating within a single dynamic system.  Powerfully punctuated by epic photographs, eloquent illustrations, and a wonderfully dynamic design, Forces of Change is at once highly accessible and deeply thought-provoking. Full of sidebars that lucidly unpack the latest field research, the essays take readers around the world -- from the peaks of the Himalaya to the mysterious depths of the sea, and from the Ladakh cultures of northern India to the A'ani and Assiniboine tribes of Montana.  Published in conjunction with a new permanent exhibit program at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, Forces of Change is a timely and vitally important consideration of science and fate at the dawn of the 21st century.",

Now forty years old, Connors continues to compete with players half his age in tournaments around the world and attributes his extraordinary endurance to his personal fitness program. Here, Jimmy Connors shares the program he and Neil Gordon, M.D., of the Kenneth Cooper Aerobics Center developed to keep him at the top of the tennis world.The Connors program is designed for people who have never exercised as well as for those who already have reached an advanced level of fitness. Unique in its sensible approach to exercise, here is a program that encourages you to create your own regimen to achieve your personal fitness or health goals. While you follow his program, Jimmy will help you stay on course by sharing the motivational techniques he uses to stay pumped up.One of the first things you'll learn is that it's not what you do - but how you do it; keeping track of how hard the exercise feels is key to getting the most benefit from it. At an early age, Jimmy learned to listen to his body, or, as Neil Gordon explains in more scientific terms, to monitor his perceived level of exertion. Now you'll find out why it's not beneficial to exercise too intensely, how to rate your perceived exertion, and what your target level should be.Two sixteen-week programs - one for the novice, one for the more advanced - offer a wide spectrum of activities that include aerobic, weight-resistance training, and stretching exercises. Each activity earns you a certain number of points determined by the number of calories burned. Comprehensive charts are provided of nearly a hundred different activities with their rating equivalencies. You'll learn how to use the Connors Count as your scorekeeper. Once you've embarked on the program of your choice, you'll find yourself echoing Jimmy's own proclamation, \"I may be forty, but I don't know when, if ever, I've felt more alive or more in control of my life.\"",

        "Description": "One of the most renowned figures in science fiction, C. J. Cherryh has been enthralling audiences for nearly thirty years with rich and complex novels. Now at the peak of her career, this three-time Hugo Award Winner launches her most ambitious work in decades, Hammerfall, part of a far-ranging series, The Gene Wars, set in an entirely new universe scarred by the most vicious of future weaponry, nanotechnology. In this brilliant novel -- possibly Cherryh's masterwork -- the fate of billions has come down to a confrontation between two profoundly alien cultures on a single desert planet.\"The mad shall be searched out and given to the Ila's messengers. No man shall conceal madness in his wife, or his son, or his daughter, or his father. Every one must be delivered up.\"-- The Book of the Ila's Au'itMarak has suffered the madness his entire life. He is a prince and warrior, strong and shrewd and expert in the ways of the desert covering his planet. In the service of his father, he has dedicated his life to overthrowing the Ila, the mysterious eternal dictator of his world. For years he has successfully hidden the visions that plague him -- voices pulling him eastward, calling Marak, Marak, Marak, amid mind-twisting visions of a silver tower. But when his secret is discovered, Marak is betrayed by his own father and forced to march in an endless caravan with the rest of his world's madmen to the Ila's city of Oburan.Instead of death, Marak finds in Oburan his destiny, and the promise of life -- if he can survive what is surely a suicidal mission. The Ila wants him to discover the source of the voices and visions that afflict the mad. Despite the dangers of the hostile desert, tensions within the caravan, and his own excruciating doubts, Marak miraculously reaches his goal -- only to be given another, even more impossible mission by the strange people in the towers.According to these beings who look like him yet act differently than anyone he has ever known, Marak has a slim chance to save his world's people from the wrath of the Ilas enemies. But to do so, he must convince them all -- warring tribes, villagers, priests, young and old, as well as the Ila herself -- to follow him on an epic trek across the burning desert before the hammer of the Ila's foes falls from the heavens above.Written with deceptive simplicity and lyricism, this riveting, fast-paced epic of war, love, and survival in a brave new world marks a major achievement from the masterful C.J. Cherryh.",

Kenny Ray Clark, a local troublemaker with a felony record, was quickly arrested, tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death. When new evidence comes to light, Miami attorney Gail Connor agrees to take the case, although her fiance, Anthony Quintana, a top criminal defense lawyer, warns her not to get involved. But one look at the trial transcript convinces Gail that her client was wrongfully convicted, and she will do everything in her power to stop the execution. Gail turns to her cousin Jackie Bryce, a rookie cop with the Stuart Police Department, to help her navigate the local terrain. Jackie is smart enough to know that the conviction stinks, and idealistic enough to care - even if it means crossing her own father, the county sheriff; and even if it brings her closer to discovering the awful truth about her parents' marriage and her mother's tragic end. In a desperate race against time, Gail must overcome her pride to ask Anthony for help. Together, they push themselves and the law to the breaking point to find the real killer. But nothing can prepare them for the layers of greed, deception, and cruelty that lay hidden for so many years behind a brutal crime. And nothing can prevent them from becoming the targets of a terrible vengeance.",

        "Description": "The death of Mathilda Gillespie shocks the English village of Fontwell and sets local tongues wagging. The wealthy old woman is found dead in her bath, a bloody kitchen knife within reach, and a scold's bridle - a medieval instrument of torture used to silence nagging women - over her head. Was her death a cleverly constructed suicide? Or a vicious murder, orchestrated by one of the many people who found Mathilda's snobbism and intolerance too cruel to bear?Sarah Blakeney, Mathilda's doctor and one of the few people who actually liked the difficult but fascinating woman, takes an interest in the case; her interest becomes very personal when she is revealed to be the main beneficiary of the deceased's will. Suddenly Sarah is the center of local gossip, as she must face the accusations of Mathilda's bereft daughter and granddaughter - as well as a police investigation that points increasingly in her own direction and forces her to face some troubling questions: What does her husband know that he's not telling? And what really did happen during those tortured hours before Mathilda's death?Minette Walters is perhaps the most acclaimed new suspense novelist of the 1990s. Her debut, The Ice House, was called \"the most impressive first novel for years\" (The Daily Telegraph) and named one of the best mysteries of 1992 by the Rocky Mountain News. The St. Petersburg Times hailed The Ice House as \"a splendid first book by a British author who is bound to be compared with Ruth Rendell and P. D. James.\"Critics greeted Walters's second novel, The Sculptress, with even greater enthusiasm. Named a top crime novel of 1993 by the Los Angeles Times Book Review and the Kansas City Star, The Sculptress was called a \"creepy but compulsive tale of psychological suspense that is hard to put down\" by The New York Times Book Review. \"Intricate, intriguing, and tantalizingly ambiguous, [The Sculptress] ratifies Walters's emergence into the front ranks of today's mystery writers,\" declared the San Diego Union Tribune, while Kirkus Reviews said, \"Walters brings a shivery mastery to the old-fashioned British whodunit, with plotting as twisted as the characters' secrets.\" With The Scold's Bridle, her stunning third novel, Walters firmly establishes herself as the best of the new breed of suspense writers.",

Part motivation and part business strategy, Threading the Needle contains a recipe for success that people can implement in their own businesses and spiritual lives.",

For three months the police have found no clues to the murder ofHope Devane, psychology professor and controversial author of a pop-psych bestseller, an angry indictment of men. Now Detective Milo Sturgis, newly assigned to the case, turns to his psychologist friend, Dr. Alex Delaware, looking for insights into Devane's life.To both men the cold stalking of Hope Devane suggests calculation fueled by hate--an execution. They discover why as they unlock, one by one, the veryprivate compartments of her life: her marriage, her shadowy work for a Beverly Hills clinic, the Conduct Committee she ran with an iron hand at theUniversity, and her baffling link to another murder victim. But it is when Alex delves into her childhood that he begins to understand the formidable woman she was--and the ties that entangled her life until the horrifying act of betrayal that ended it.\u00a0\u00a0Building to a white-knuckle climax in which Alex sets a trapfor a killer, The Clinic is brilliantly plotted suspense as wrenchingly disturbing as today's headlines.",

Branson, Missouri, a tiny town buried deep in the Ozark Mountains, has become the live entertainment capital of the United States. Last year alone, more than 5 million fans flocked to Branson's thirty huge celebrity theaters built by performers such as Andy Williams, Johnny Cash, and Conway Twitty.  Second only to Disney World in number of visitors annually, Branson happened because a couple of old guitar pickers like Box Car Willie and Roy Clark got tired of the grind of the road and set up shop in this beautiful but sleepy neck of the woods. Other acts, finding it too expensive to tour (even if the audience was there to support them), followed suit. Like magic, legions of fans in cars, RVs, and tour buses started to appear.  An expected 9 million people will pack up Grandma and the kiddies and head to Branson this year for some wholesome entertainment the way many Americans remember it.",

        "Authors": "By Fisher, Carrie",
        "Description": "Now that she's conquered rehab and romance, best-selling novelist Carrie Fisher boldly goes where no man has gone before: motherhood.Hollywood screenwriter Cora Sharpe has taken to writing letters to the unborn child she's tentatively dubbed Esme - even though it sounds like a noise your nose makes. But then, Cora has what one of the endless intimates she thinks of as her Committee calls \"a big loud life,\" and recent events have been no exception. Her confidant and writing partner, Bud, has been on a bipolar roller coaster. Her dear friend William, AIDS-ridden, has finally taken leave of his life, with the aplomb befitting \"a suburban show business sultan.\" And in the vacuum that follows his departure, Cora's romance with quiet, gentle Ray has suddenly flickered and expired.Then Cora finds out she's pregnant, and even the Committee can't steer her through this one. In a fight-or-flight confrontation with maturity, flight seems to have the upper hand. So when her mother, Viv, tries to rally support for her latest madcap scheme - to kidnap her Alzheimer's-stricken father from a nursing home and take him back to Whitewright, Texas, the place of his birth - Cora, for once, is game. With Bud in tow, she signs on for what turns out to be a cosmic (not to mention comic) exploration of the urges that drive us to feather our nests and fill them, to flee them and find our way home.With singular deftness, Fisher captures the ambivalence and absurdity of modern maternity, in her wittiest and wisest novel to date.",
