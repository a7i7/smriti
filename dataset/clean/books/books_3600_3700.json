Their male coach expected little from his \"ladies, \" and their mediocre performance convinced them he was right.Then a kind of miracle happened. Emiria Salzmann, Thunder's new coach, a top player herself, knew what it took to win--discipline, relentless drills, thigh-burning sprints, and an inspired passing game. The girls hated it, but their coach never let up. Tough and determined, she showed them what it felt like to be winners--and they loved it. As the momentum grew with a string of victories, the girls thrived on the competition, believing they had the right stuff to become champions.They were right! With spirits soaring, Thunder won its league on the last day of the season and headed for the state cup, emerging not just as powerful athletes but as strong, confident, emotionally healthy human beings--champions in the game of soccer, and in the game of life.",

He expects the worst, as usual. But they've come to ask for his help.A man was wrenched from his car by a mob at the riots' peak and escaped into a nearby apartment building. Soon afterward, a redheaded woman known as Little Scarlet was found dead in that building - and the fleeing man is the obvious suspect. But the man has vanished.The police fear that their presence in certain neighborhoods could spark a new inferno, so they ask Easy Rawlins to see what he can discover. The vanished man is the key, but he is only the beginning. Easy enlists the help of his longtime friend Mouse to break through the shroud. And what Easy finds is a killer whose rage, like that which burned in the city for weeks, is intrinsically woven around deep-set passions - feelings echoed within Easy himself.Rawlins's hunt for the killer reveals a new city emerging from the ashes, with the promise of a new life for Easy, Mouse, and his old friends Jackson Blue and Jewelle.",

        "Title": "Oracle Web Applications: PL/SQL Developer's Intro: Developer's Introduction",
        "Authors": "By Odewahn, Andrew",
        "Description": "This compact guide provides the jump-start Oracle developers need to make the transition from traditional programming to the development of useful Web applications for Oracle8i. Even readers who start out knowing nothing about HTML, PL/SQL, or Oracle's other tools will learn how to create simple Web applications in a matter of days. The book focuses on Oracle8i, but also covers Web development for earlier Oracle versions (Oracle8 and Oracle7).Background:The explosion in the use of the Internet and the Web has resulted in a whole new way of doing business. Developers who only yesterday were using COBOL to write accounts payable systems are now being asked to create a broad range of new Internet-based applications ranging from electronic commerce (e-commerce) Web sites to internal data warehouses to enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unfortunately, the filesystem architectures of most Web systems aren't up to the task. The new breed of Web applications -- which are quickly becoming critical resources that companies need to survive -- demand a platform that provides production-quality tools for content management, application development, and application integration. And current Web techniques are inadequate in many ways.Oracle8i, Oracle's \"Internet database,\" gives Web developers a way to build Web technology on top of a relational database, rather than on a traditional filesystem. With Oracle8i, companies can apply well understood, reliable, production-quality database methodologies to Web content management. Oracle8i also supports a wide variety of application development platforms and tools that are tightly integrated to the core database. Finally, Oracle8i supports technologies that help companies tie their Web-based applications into legacy applications.There is a lot to learn in Oracle8i. Not only does it enhance basic database features, it introduces Java and a variety of Web development tools. Oracle8i provides a soup-to-nuts platform for Web site and Web application development that extends traditional database concepts to Web content. It replaces the traditional filesystem used by most Web servers with a database management system.Many users are intimidated by the vast array of new technologies in Oracle8i. And yet, they are under pressure to use these technologies to build complex Web applications right now. This book gives such users a way to start using Oracle8i immediately to create useful Web applications. It is a concise, easy-to-read guide to the basic technologies developers need to understand in order to build Web applications.Contains:The book describes the following Web development tools:PL/SQL-- a structured programming language that combines procedural constructs and standard SQL. It offers such features as cursors, loops, conditional and sequential control statements, exception handlers, records, tables, and constructs for developing modular code (functions, procedures, and packages). PL/SQL Toolkit -- a set of PL/SQL packages supplied by Oracle for use in developing Web applications.HTML -- an ASCII-based markup language used to create Web pages.WebDB -- A software system for building, monitoring, and creating content-driven Web sites; it allows users to use a Web browser to access and store information in the Oracle8i database.Oracle Application Server (OAS) -- an extensible Web server that uses plug-in programs called cartridges to allow database-integrated Web systems to be developed in a variety of languages (e.g., PL/SQL, Java, Perl).XML -- An emerging standard for creating self-describing documents. It is similar to HTML but allows you to create your own markup tags. XML is expected to be a key technology in electronic commerce systems.The book also presents several fully realized sample Web applications that w",

We celebrate the end of the Cold War and the emergence of a new world order - and then see the explosion of civil wars in Bosnia and Georgia, the resurgent conflicts in Angola and Rwanda, growing insurrection in northern India, and the ever-present threat of war around the globe.Timelines of War is the first-ever chronology of all of the wars, revolutions, battles, leaders, and weapons that have played such an enormous role in human history. From the rise of Assyria, the siege of Troy, and the century-long Chinese-Hun war two thousand years ago to the massive world wars, revolutions, and superpower conflicts that have plagued our century; from Caesar and Genghis Khan to Napoleon and Schwarzkopf; and from the invention of the slingshot to the creation of the atom bomb, this magnificent volume displays, at a glance, significant world events and war-related developments from 100,000 BC to the present day.Organized in an easy-to-follow format that allows readers to link or compare events and people across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North and South America, Asia, and the Pacific in any given period, Timelines of War is a sweeping overview of history that highlights fascinating developments in military science and technology as well as important landmarks in the quest for peace.Unparalleled in both its vast scope and precise detail - and containing extensive chronologies of major modern conflicts like the American Civil War and World War II - Timelines of War presents a remarkable panorama of human history, both at war and at peace.",

        "Description": "Master of mystery Robert Barnard, internationally acclaimed for his suspenseful, witty literary gems, cleverly mixes past and present in A Cry from the Dark, an intriguing tour de force sweeping from 1930s Australia to contemporary London. Bettina Whitelaw has come a long way from her childhood in the little outback town of Bundaroo, Australia. Many years have passed, a lifetime really, but she's never forgotten what happened there on the evening that changed her life forever.How could she forget the school dance, her taunting classmates, dancing with the strange but brilliant English boy, Hughie Naismyth? How could she forget what happened next, when, overheated and exhilarated by the music and the moment, she wandered off alone into a secluded, wooded area? Now a renowned, elderly author living in London's elegant Holland Park, Bettina faces a flood of memories as she works on her memoirs, even though her focus is more on the frightening things that are happening today. Someone has recently entered her home and gone through her desk. The intruder is clearly not an ordinary burglar. It must be someone she knows. She's been a little lax in handing out keys, so the suspects are many -- her nephew, Mark; her agent, Clare; her friends, Peter or Katie. Or it could be someone else.What does Bettina possess that this person would want to steal? A puzzle that at first seems mildly disturbing soon turns deadly serious. Someone is willing to kill -- but why? Does the answer rest in Bundaroo or nearer to home? A Cry from the Dark shows us vintage Robert Barnard as he slyly lays the clues that lead to his trademark surprise -- and poignant -- ending.",

        "Description": "From the acclaimed author of the national bestseller Ahab's Wife comes an inspiring, brilliantly rendered new novel of the awakening conscience of the South and of an entire nation.Written with the same scope and emotional depth as her previous award-winning novel, Four Spirits is set in Sena Jeter Naslund's home city of Birmingham, Alabama, a city that in the 1960s was known as Bombingham. Naslund brings to life this tumultuous time, weaving together the lives of blacks and whites, civil rights advocates and racists, and the events of peaceful protest and violent repression, to create a tapestry of American social transformation.Stella Silver is an idealistic, young white college student brought up by her genteel, mannered aunts. She first witnesses the events of the freedom movement from a safe distance but, along with her friend Cat Cartwright, is soon drawn into the mounting conflagration. Stella's and Cat's lives are forever altered by their new friendships with other committed freedom fighters.A student at a black college, Christine Taylor is inspired to action by the examples of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth. She courageously struggles to balance her family responsibilities, education, and work with the passions and dangers of the demonstrations. Her friend Gloria Callahan, a gifted young cellist and descendant of a runaway slave, tries to move beyond her personal shyness and family coziness to enter a wider circle, including blacks and whites, men and women, all involved with the protests. Lionel Parrish, teacher, preacher, and peddler of funeral insurance, battles his own demons of lust and self-preservation, while New York activist Jonathan Green gives up a promising career as a pianist to work for racial justice in the South.These characters all add their voices to the chorus that makes up this symphony of innocent children and the mythic elderly, the devoutly religious and the skeptical humanist, the wealthy and the poor, the city and the country. Poignant and evocative, rich in historical detail, and filled with the humanity that is the hallmark of Naslund's fiction, Four Spirits is a compelling tale that transcends tragedy and evokes redemptive triumph.",

He also reveals today's Roman men and women in all their appealing contradictions: their gregarious caffe culture; inborn artistic flair; passionate appreciation of good food; instinctive mistrust of technology; showy sex appeal; ingrained charm and expressiveness; surprisingly unusual attitudes toward marriage and religion; and much, much more.",

        "Description": "One of America's most popular personal finance experts reveals how you can become happier at any income level through better money management  Millions of Americans have turned to Jean Chatzky for financial advice, thanks to her weekly appearances on NBC's Today and her column in Money magazine. Now, in You Don't Have to Be Rich, she analyzes the results of a unique survey in which she questioned 1,500 Americans about their financial attitudes and behaviors. She looks at how much money people actually do need to guarantee a happy, comfortable life. And gets down to the nitty-gritty, isolating behaviors that-if adopted-can significantly improve a life.  The results of this proprietary survey-conducted with the help of the Roper Center-are remarkable. Chatzky found that while a certain amount of money buys comfort, money can't make you happy-at least not in the way most people believe it can. But it can make you miserable, if you're managing it wrong. That's why it's time to make a change.  In her frank, engaging style, Chatzky explains how to \"own your money\" to create a happy and comfortable life. She outlines the financial habits of happy people and shows how anyone can be a part of this group, no matter what they earn. Filled with fresh insights and real life examples, You Don't Have to Be Rich reaffirms that finances don't have to be a source of stress and that living within your means can be extremely rewarding.",

        "Title": "God and Ronald Reagan: A Spiritual Life",
        "Authors": "By Kengor, Paul",
        "Description": "Ronald Reagan is hailed today for a presidency that restored optimism to America, engendered years of economic prosperity, and helped bring about the fall of the Soviet Union. Yet until now little attention has been paid to the role Reagan's personal spirituality played in his political career, shaping his ideas, bolstering his resolve, and ultimately compelling him to confront the brutal -- and, not coincidentally, atheistic -- Soviet empire.In this groundbreaking book, political historian Paul Kengor draws upon Reagan's legacy of speeches and correspondence, and the memories of those who knew him well, to reveal a man whose Christian faith remained deep and consistent throughout his more than six decades in public life. Raised in the Disciples of Christ Church by a devout mother with a passionate missionary streak, Reagan embraced the church after reading a Christian novel at the age of eleven. A devoted Sunday-school teacher, he absorbed the church's model of \"practical Christianity\" and strived to achieve it in every stage of his life.But it was in his lifelong battle against communism -- first in Hollywood, then on the political stage -- that Reagan's Christian beliefs had their most profound effect. Appalled by the religious repression and state-mandated atheism of Bolshevik Marxism, Reagan felt called by a sense of personal mission to confront the USSR. Inspired by influences as diverse as C.S. Lewis, Whittaker Chambers, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he waged an openly spiritual campaign against communism, insisting that religious freedom was the bedrock of personal liberty. \"The source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual,\" he said in his Evil Empire address. \"And because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man.\"From a church classroom in 1920s Dixon, Illinois, to his triumphant mission to Moscow in 1988, Ronald Reagan was both political leader and spiritual crusader. God and Ronald Reagan deepens immeasurably our understanding of how these twin missions shaped his presidency -- and changed the world.",

        "Title": "Shield of the Republic: The United States Navy in an Era of Cold War and Violent Peace 1945-1962",
        "Authors": "By Isenberg, Michael T.",
        "Description": "Michael T. Isenberg has chronicled, in the first of a projected two-volume study, the historic institution of the United States Navy in the Cold War era. Shield of the Republic, a definitive work on the era, demonstrates both a narrative sweep and a command of style that are rare in works of modern history.The overarching themes of the book are the emergence of the two superpower nations between 1945 and 1962 and an examination of the technologies that rang down the curtain on the Mahanian age of sail. At the conclusion of World War II, naval leaders confronted a drastically redrawn world and, like the rest of the American people, found the adjustment to the bitter, suspicion-riddled years of the 1950s to be both challenging and unsettling.The Korean War, fought largely with World War II equipment, settled much of the debate over what new naval roles and capacities were to be, and emphasized the nature of Pax Americana, which, whatever else the phrase implied, meant American naval hegemony on the oceans of the world, a military dominance that came to its bone-chilling conclusion during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.Shield of the Republic is the epic story of these dramatic seventeen years following the Japanese surrender, a time when the Navy struggled to find its strategic footing in the shadow of the atomic bomb, on the slippery ground of interservice rivalry, and amid the frightening realities of superpower conflict. Naval leaders, from the flinty Ernest King to the brilliant Forrest Sherman to the hard-driving Arleigh Burke, battled to keep their beloved service on an even keel while changing its makeup to meet the numerous and unexpected problems of the new era.Unlike many naval histories that consider the Navy merely as an adjunct of American international relations, Shield of the Republic examines the Navy from the inside out and from the keel plates up. Particular attention is paid the rapid and bewildering acceleration of naval technology, from the lurking nuclear ballistic missile submarine to the missile-firing destroyer to the marvels of supersonic jet aircraft, and it is in these descriptions where Isenberg's language soars. The men who worked with these technological wonders receive full treatment, from the youngest boot to the saltiest admiral, from the women who were for decades relegated to support positions, to the most powerful political leaders, like Harry Truman (who liked sailors but distrusted most admirals), and John Kennedy (whose much-vaunted wartime naval adventures were a bit short of what they were cooked up to be).And wherever the bows of the Cold War Navy cut water, they invariably brought with them American economic imperialism - the self-assurance of the only nation to emerge practically unscathed from World War II. The unique global reach of this Cold War Navy meant that the first taste of Americanism which many foreigners ever had often came in Navy blue and gold.Using the Navy as a fitting symbol for American foreign policy during these years, Michael T. Isenberg has created a sweeping saga, an enduring work, that will be appreciated both by naval experts and by general readers alike.",

Mark Mathabane first came to prominence with the publication of Kaffir Boy, which became a New York Times bestseller.  His story of growing up in South Africa was one of the most riveting accounts of life under apartheid. Mathabane's newest book, Miriam's Song, is the story of Mark's sister, who was left behind in South Africa. It is the gripping tale of a woman -- representative of an entire generation -- who came of age amid the violence and rebellion of the 1980s and finally saw the destruction of apartheid and the birth of a new and democratic South Africa.  Mathabane writes in Miriam's voice, based on stories she told him, but he has re-created her unforgettable experience as only someone who also lived through it could. The immediacy of the hardships that brother and sister endured -- from daily school beatings to near-overwhelming poverty -- is balanced by the beauty of their childhood observations and the true affection that they have for each other. Miriam emerges as both an innocent child drawn into the war against apartheid and a strong woman forever changed by the struggles, brutality, and politics of the world around her; Mark emerges once more as a writer of extraordinary ability, sensitivity, and insight.  Miriam's Song is memoir writing at its finest. With its courage, determination, resilience, hope, and faith, it is a truly inspirational story, spectacularly told.",

        "Title": "The Perreaus and Mrs. Rudd: Forgery and Betrayal in Eighteenth-Century London",
        "Authors": "By Andrew, Donna T. and McGowen, Randall",
        "Description": "The Perreaus and Mrs. Rudd tells the remarkable story of a complex forgery uncovered in London in 1775. Like the trials of Martin Guerre and O.J. Simpson, the Perreau-Rudd case\u2014filled with scandal, deceit, and mystery\u2014preoccupied a public hungry for sensationalism. Peopled with such familiar figures as John Wilkes, King George III, Lord Mansfield, and James Boswell, this story reveals the deep anxieties of this period of English capitalism. The case acts as a prism that reveals the hopes, fears, and prejudices of that society. Above all, this episode presents a parable of the 1770s, when London was the center of European finance and national politics, of fashionable life and tell-all journalism, of empire achieved and empire lost. The crime, a hanging offense, came to light with the arrest of identical twin brothers, Robert and Daniel Perreau, after the former was detained trying to negotiate a forged bond. At their arraignment they both accused Daniel's mistress, Margaret Caroline Rudd, of being responsible for the crime. The brothers' trials coincided with the first reports of bloodshed in the American colonies at Lexington and Concord and successfully competed for space in the newspapers. From March until the following January, people could talk of little other than the fate of the Perreaus and the impending trial of Mrs. Rudd. The participants told wildly different tales and offered strikingly different portraits of themselves. The press was filled with letters from concerned or angry correspondents. The public, deeply divided over who was guilty, was troubled by evidence that suggested not only that fair might be foul, but that it might not be possible to decide which was which. While the decade of the 1770s has most frequently been studied in relation to imperial concerns and their impact upon the political institutions of the day, this book draws a different portrait of the period, making a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre its point of entry. Exhaustively researched and brilliantly presented, it offers both a vivid panorama of London and a gauge for tracking the shifting social currents of the period.",

One of our most brilliant public intellectuals, Paul Berman has spent his career writing on revolutionary movements and their totalitarian aspects. Here he argues that, in the terror war, we are not facing a battle of the West against Islama clash of civilizations. We are facing, instead, the same battle that tore apart Europe during most of the twentieth century, only in a new version. It is the clash of liberalism and its enemiesthe battle between freedom and totalitarianism that arose in Europe many years ago and spread to the Muslim world. The author considers the wars against fascism and communism from the past, and draws cautionary lessons. But he also draws from those past experiences a liberal program for the presenta program that departs in fundamental respects from the policies of the Bush administration.",

In their 1995 blockbuster The Discipline of Market Leaders, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema explained how great companies dominated their markets by offering superior value propositions. Now Treacy is back with an equally groundbreaking book-revealing how great companies master growth each year and how all businesses can identify and exploit opportunities for increased revenues, gross margins, and profits.  Treacy's main point is simple-it really is possible to grow your business by 10 percent or more, year after year, in good times and bad, without cheating. Great companies already know how to do it, and the rest of us can learn their strategies and do the same thing. Using case studies from industry leaders such as Dell Computer, Home Depot, and GE, he shows the five steps that are imperative to ensure growth:  ? keep the growth you have already earned ? look for growth where it's likely to be found ? take business from your competitors  Treacy believes that any business can grow at a consistent double-digit rate, and with Double-Digit Growth, managers and investors now have the tools to achieve that lofty goal and maintain corporate success.",

        "Title": "A Question of Loyalty: Gen. Billy Mitchell and the Court-Martial That Gripped the Nation",
        "Authors": "By Waller, Douglas C.",
        "Description": "It had all the ingredients of a movie drama:a scandal that grips Washington and touches the White House; bitter battles and backroom intrigue at the highest levels of the U.S. military; glamorous women who make or break the careers of powerful men; a high-stakes trial with a celebrity defendant who captures the nation's attention ...A Question of Loyalty plunges into the seven-week Washington trial of Gen. William \"Billy\" Mitchell, the hero of the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I and the man who proved in 1921 that planes could sink a battleship. In 1925 Mitchell was frustrated by the slow pace of aviation development, and he sparked a political firestorm, accusing the army and navy high commands, and by inference the president, of treason and criminal negligence in the way they conducted national defense. He was put on trial for insubordination in a spectacular court-martial that became a national obsession during the Roaring Twenties.Douglas Waller has crafted a compelling new biography of the daring Billy Mitchell, a larger-than-life figure remembered as much for his outspokenness as for his innovations in the use of airpower. Waller has uncovered a trove of new letters, diaries, and confidential documents that have enabled him to capture in detail the drama of the court and to build a rich and revealing biography of Mitchell, one of the army's most controversial and flamboyant generals.Born to a millionaire Midwest family at the end of the 1870s, Mitchell joined the military at the age of eighteen and became one of its rising stars. During World War I, he led the largest armada of airplanes ever to attack an enemy force and returned to the United States a dashing young general with a chest full of medals and a radical vision of airpower as the only decisive instrument for future wars. But as the military shrank in the postwar years, Mitchell became increasingly impatient and vocal, lashing out at bureaucratic enemies he accused of impeding airpower's progress. After a tragic airship accident that shocked the nation, he publicly blasted the War and Navy Departments for their handling of aviation and was put on trial for it.A Question of Loyalty is a story about Washington politics, about love and betrayal, about heroes in battle, about determined lawyers and powerful military men pitted against one another in a courtroom.",

        "Title": "Breaking New Ground: American Women 1800-1848 (Young Oxford History of Women in the United States)",
        "Authors": "By Goldberg, Michael L.",
        "Description": "At the beginning of the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution lured many Americans from farms to the cities, creating new opportunities and new limitations for women. Some women were forced to look for work in the few occupations open to them, while others became full-time homemakers. Americans constructed new ways of thinking about the \"proper roles\" of women and men, with women as the moral educators in the private sphere of home and church while men participated in the public sphere of business and politics. By 1848, with the first women's rights convention at Seneca Falls, some women were exposing how these conditions and ideas kept them from achieving their highest potential. Even before this revolutionary event, women mill workers, African-American slaves, and others were resisting their oppressive conditions in a variety of ways. Michael Goldberg shows readers how women began to understand their ability to influence events through education, religion, and anti-slavery societies, and he discusses the hopes and concerns about marriage and courtship of both slave and free women, and how changes in personal relationships reflected changes in society at large. Emma Willard, one of the earliest proponents of expanded female education, Margaret Fuller, abolitionists Angelina and Sarah Grimk\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd, Mother Seton, Lucy Stone, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Lydia Maria Child are but a few who left their marks as women began breaking new ground.",

His mother packs up their home in Cape Town and takes him to a tiny backwater town in the semi-desert Karoo region, where she withdraws into her painting. Douglas, a city kid in an insular community, makes only two friends: a beautiful girl named Marika, with her adventurous spirit and tyrannical father; and an old garage worker named Moses, with his junkyard Volvo and dreams of driving away to Cape Town.  Against the backdrop of the bitter conflict of 1970s South Africa, Douglas develops a clearer insight into himself and his place in the world, a world where dreams and reality meet in a surprising twist. Blazing with color and light, Karoo Boy offers a sensuous and lyrical evocation of South Africa that leaves a lasting impression and ultimately ends on a note of hope.",

Ranging widely across time and languages, Andrew Vogel Ettin explores the ways in which various biblical and traditional works as well as modern and contemporary texts- Jewish and non-Jewish, religious and literary- treat the nature of silence and speech and the tension between them. He situates this tension at the heart of the creative process and argues that language and silence need each other and contribute to the power and meaning of one another.Speaking Silence is a broadly interdisciplinary work that will appeal to scholars and readers interested in modern and contemporary literature, Jewish studies, religion and literature, and aesthetics.",

Moviegoers know they can trust Turan's impeccable  taste. His eclectic selection represents the kind of sophisticated, adult, and entertaining films intelligent viewers are hungry for. More importantly, Turan shows readers what makes these unusual films so great, revealing how talented filmmakers and actors have managed to create the wonderful highs we experience in front of the  silver screen.",

        "Description": "In 1919 Yale University Press inaugurated the Yale Series of Younger Poets, designed to \"afford a public medium for the work of young men and women who have not yet secured a wide public recognition.\" This anthology of the longest-running poetry series in the United States tells the story of American poetry in this century. At first a forum for a conservative taste in parochial college verse, the Younger Poets Series soon opened up to unconventional but profound young talents from across the country?such as James Agee, Muriel Rukeyser, Margaret Walker, William Meredith, Adrienne Rich, John Ashbery, John Hollander, James Tate, Carolyn Forch\u00e9, and Robert Hass. This anthology includes poems from the first book by each of the 92 winners of the annual Younger Poets contest.The selections are accompanied by an introduction by George Bradley, the 1986 winner of the contest. Bradley charts the course of the series under the aegis of such contest judges as Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t, W. H. Auden, and James Merrill, lacing his narrative with anecdotes about the judges and winners. He also establishes the series\u2019 vital role in the development of American poetry and American publishing. The anthology is divided into two sections: \"The Early Years,\" which briefly presents the first 31 winners of the contest, and \"The Modern Series,\" which gives ample room to display the early work of some of America's finest poets. All poets are introduced by a biographical headnote, and in the second section Bradley has added a brief commentary directing the reader to the salient features of each poet's work.",

Our shared confusion -- Who are the attackers? Why are we targets? -- is cleared away in a book as dramatic as it is authoritative.  Updated with new chapters on Afghanistan and the the broader Islamic movement, Sacred Rage combines Robin Wright's extraordinary reportage on the Islamic world with an historian's grasp of context to explain the roots, the motives, and the goals of the Islamic resurgence. Wright talked to terrorists, militant religious leaders, and fighters from Beirut to Islamabad and Kabul. Their voices of rage reverberate here -- right up to the attacks in New York and Washington.  Across continents extends a challenge we fail to understand at our peril. Sacred Rage now casts light on the war being fought in the shadows.",

And so Faith finds herself improbably at the rearing of her father\u2019s brother, Jack, an ascetic priest whose current endeavor is an occult ?experimental community\u201d comprised mainly of expatriate Tibetans.

        "Title": "Skipping Towards Gomorrah: The Seven Deadly Sins and the Pursuit of Happiness in America",
        "Authors": "By Savage, Dan",
        "Description": "Dan Savage is irreverent, irrepressible, and opinionated. He's held his own on Politically Incorrect, told tales on This American Life, continues to write a beloved nationally syndicated column-and he's had it up to here (my hand is higher than my head) with the moral, conservative scolds who proclaim America is slouching towards Gomorrah (to use Robert Bork's phrase). Are we really that bad?  Yes, we are! And in Skipping Towards Gomorrah, Dan Savage eviscerates those cynics as he commits each of the Seven Deadly Sins himself (or tries to) and finds those everyday Americans who take particular delight in their sinful pursuits. Among them:  Greed: Gamblers reveal secrets behind outrageous fortune. Lust: \"We're swingers!\"-you won't believe who's doing it. Gluttony: Dan meets gluttons with attitude at a pro-fat conference. Sloth: Leave it to Dan to find a way to celebrate this sin that will get him in trouble with his mother. Anger: Texans shoot off some rounds and then listen to Dan fire off on his own about guns, control, and the Second Amendment. Envy: Meet the rich-then be glad you're not one of them. Pride: You'll never look at a gay pride parade the same way again.  Couple all this sinning with a unique history of the Seven Deadly Sins, a new interpretation of the biblical stories of Sodom and Gomorrah, and enough Bork, Bennett, Buchanan, et al, bashing to more than make up for their incessant carping, and you've got the most provocative book of the fall.",

        "Title": "The Mammoth Book of Eyewitness Battles: Eyewitness Accounts of History's Greatest Battles, from Thermopyle to the Gulf War",
        "Authors": "By Lawrence, Richard Russell (EDT)",
        "Description": "This book is a rousing collection of eyewitness accounts detailing 150 of the most crucial battles in the past 2,500 years of world history. From the Spartan defeat of the Athenians at Delion, recounted in 424 b.c. by Thucydides, to a fighter pilot\u2019s firsthand account of an air attack by a squadron of Tornados on Iraq in Operation Desert Storm, with dramatic immediacy this stirring Mammoth volume chronicles 25 centuries of military history in the words of the hoplites, knights, musketeers, foot soldiers, cavalrymen, and bombardiers who fought them. Drawn from the reports both of commanding officers and of rank-and-file soldiers in the presentation of critical battles in such military conflicts as the Crusades, the Hundred Years War, the American War for Independence and Civil War, and World Wars I and II, the book\u2019s selections provide both an overview of what happened and a vivid picture of what it was like in the trenches or on the field when it happened. Where it happened ranges from Antioch to Agincourt to Austerlitz to Antietam, from Bunker Hill to San Juan Hill, from the Crimea to the Somme, from Crecy to Coruna to Khe Sanh in Vietnam. Throughout, editor Richard Lawrence places the eyewitness accounts in a narrative context and includes more than 50 maps that situate the battles and the fields where this volume\u2019s officers and infantrymen momentously made history.",
