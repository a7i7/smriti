        "Title": "When God Interrupts: Finding New Life Through Unwanted Change",
        "Authors": "By Barnes, M. Craig",
        "Description": "Our lives are constantly changing. It's hard to keep up, to keep our balance. It's hard to keep trusting in God. And it's especially difficult when the changes we're faced with are unwanted: the death of a loved one, a child leaving home, an illness, a frustrated dream.Craig Barnes knows the dark side of change. As a pastor, he has counseled many Christians through tough times of transition. And he has been challenged by unwanted changes--interruptions--in his own life. At times it seems as though God has moved far, far away. But Barnes has discovered that just the opposite is true: during times of change and seeming abandonment, God is right at our side offering to lead us in a new direction, offering us new life. He writes, \"A young widow can outlive her grief and decide her life may never be the same but is far from over. A lost job can become the beginning of a new vocation.\"Here is the book for all who have known disappointment, bereavement or the shattering of faith, a book all the more valuable because it promises hope without denying despair. In When God Interrupts a sensitive, insightful pastor shows us how we can be found by God in the middle of unwanted change.",

        "Authors": "By King, Ross",
        "Description": "In 1508, despite strong advice to the contrary, the powerful Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the newly restored Sistine Chapel. With little experience as a painter (though famed for his sculpture David), Michelangelo was reluctant to begin the massive project. Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling recounts the four extraordinary years Michelangelo spent laboring over the vast ceiling while the power politics and personal rivalries that abounded in Rome swirled around him. Battling against ill health, financial difficulties, domestic problems, the pope's impatience, and a bitter rivalry with the brilliant young painter Raphael, Michelangelo created scenes so beautiful that they are considered one of the greatest masterpieces of all time. A panorama of illustrious figures converged around the creation of this great work-from the great Dutch scholar Desiderius Erasmus to the young Martin Luther-and Ross King skillfully weaves them through his compelling historical narrative, offering uncommon insight into the intersection of art and history.",

We crave intimacy and interconnectedness, companionship and camaraderie. Yet most of us eventually begin to wonder if we want too much. As heartbreak and disappointment take their toll, we become convinced that our desire for deep connection is our downfall. Not understanding that a woman's longings are her strength, we bury or ignore this God-given compass and lose our way.Yet the desire to connect persists. We make cookies for a new family in the neighborhood, send a note of encouragement to someone at church, plan date nights with our spouse, call a friend after a bad day at work to tell her every detail because we know she cares. And still we long for more. What is behind this yearning? Is it healthy? Is it normal? Does it have a purpose? Yes, says author and licensed professional counselor Sharon Hersh--and in Bravehearts, she'll teach how your deepest longings can lead you to rich relationships and give you the courage to love with abandon.",

        "Description": "This extraordinary book explains the engine that has catapulted the Internet from backwater to ubiquity\u2014and reveals that it is sputtering precisely because of its runaway success. With the unwitting help of its users, the generative Internet is on a path to a lockdown, ending its cycle of innovation\u2014and facilitating unsettling new kinds of control.\u00a0IPods, iPhones, Xboxes, and TiVos represent the first wave of Internet-centered products that can\u2019t be easily modified by anyone except their vendors or selected partners. These \u201ctethered appliances\u201d have already been used in remarkable but little-known ways: car GPS systems have been reconfigured at the demand of law enforcement to eavesdrop on the occupants at all times, and digital video recorders have been ordered to self-destruct thanks to a lawsuit against the manufacturer thousands of miles away. New Web 2.0 platforms like Google mash-ups and Facebook are rightly touted\u2014but their applications can be similarly monitored and eliminated from a central source. As tethered appliances and applications eclipse the PC, the very nature of the Internet\u2014its \u201cgenerativity,\u201d or innovative character\u2014is at risk.\u00a0The Internet\u2019s current trajectory is one of lost opportunity. Its salvation, Zittrain argues, lies in the hands of its millions of users. Drawing on generative technologies like Wikipedia that have so far survived their own successes, this book shows how to develop new technologies and social structures that allow users to work creatively and collaboratively, participate in solutions, and become true \u201cnetizens.\u201d",

        "Title": "In Spite of the Gods: The Strange Rise of Modern India",
        "Authors": "By Luce, Edward",
        "Description": "India remains a mystery to many Americans, even as it is poised to become the world\u2019s third largest economy within a generation, outstripping Japan. It will surpass China in population by 2032 and will have more English speakers than the United States by 2050. In In Spite of the Gods, Edward Luce, a journalist who covered India for many years, makes brilliant sense of India and its rise to global power. Already a number-one bestseller in India, his book is sure to be acknowledged for years as the definitive introduction to modern India. In Spite of the Gods illuminates a land of many contradictions. The booming tech sector we read so much about in the West, Luce points out, employs no more than one million of India\u2019s 1.1 billion people. Only 35 million people, in fact, have formal enough jobs to pay taxes, while three-quarters of the country lives in extreme deprivation in India\u2019s 600,000 villages. Yet amid all these extremes exists the world\u2019s largest experiment in representative democracy\u2014and a largely successful one, despite bureaucracies riddled with horrifying corruption. Luce shows that India is an economic rival to the U.S. in an entirely different sense than China is.  There is nothing in India like the manufacturing capacity of China, despite the huge potential labor force.  An inept system of public education leaves most Indians illiterate and unskilled. Yet at the other extreme, the middle class produces ten times as many engineering students a year as the United States.  Notwithstanding its future as a major competitor in a globalized economy, American. leaders have been encouraging India\u2019s rise, even welcoming it into the nuclear energy club, hoping to balance China\u2019s influence in Asia.  Above all, In Spite of the Gods is an enlightening study of the forces shaping India as it tries to balance the stubborn traditions of the past with an unevenly modernizing present. Deeply informed by scholarship and history, leavened by humor and rich in anecdote, it shows that India has huge opportunities as well as tremendous challenges that make the future \u201chers to lose.\u201d",

Losing her family when she was only six years old, she was rescued by authorities who didn't even want to imagine what unspeakable horrors she had endured. But Jill knew, and remembered well. Now, she was a mistress of manipulation, an expert predator. With her golden looks and iridescent eyes, she enticed men and women, submitting to their most private fantasies, then taking everything they had. Even in the charged heat of pleasure, she always left a wake of aching desire behind...and always looked ahead....Leslie Chamberlain possessed a consuming appetite only success could satisfy...or so she thought. Statuesque, with fiery hair and an incandescent spirit, she was born penniless in a town where status was measured by money. But big dreams drove her to stardom at one of the nation's hottest advertising agencies, where multimillion-dollar clients vied for her talents and sexy young lotharios competed for her favors. One man changed it all forever - a man whose expert touch became an irresistible addiction, whose urgent whispers promised her a lifetime of exquisite ecstasy, and whose treacherous heart concealed a cruel secret that would turn a glittering dream into a nightmare....At thirty-three, Jordan Lazarus was the wealthiest man in America...But getting to the top had not been easy. His razor-sharp intelligence, lean, handsome body, and shrewd business sense were hardly assets in the backwoods factory town where he grew up. But loyalty to his destitute family forced him to follow a singular destiny that led to the very seat of corporate power. Now, he seemed to have everything: a vast business empire, riches beyond imagination, and a gallery of willing seductresses who found his velvet caresses as inventive as his thoughts. Yet within Jordan's soul was an obsession for something he dare not think about - something that could ignite a tantalizing flame extinguished long ago....From the cutthroat corporate towers of Chicago, Detroit, and New York, to Long Island's luxurious gold coast, where scandal smolders restlessly beneath the polished veneer of wealth, these three will come together...reckless players in a high-stakes game, risking the ultimate betrayal, and abandoning the rules for the fruits of forbidden passion.",

        "Description": "Patrick O'Brian has emerged, in the opinion of many, as one of the greatest novelists now writing in English. His fame rests mainly on the achievement of the epic Aubrey/Maturin novels, but few readers know that O'Brian first made his reputation as a writer of short fiction. Collected here for the first time are twenty-seven stories that O'Brian wishes to preserve: stories of uncommon lyricism and beauty that will confirm his rightful place in the front rank of short-story writers as well as of novelists.Although the tone of this collection ranges effortlessly from the humorous to the dramatic, the most characteristic and memorable stories often have to do with a glimpse of savage, destructive forces through the fragile shell of human civilization. The threatened chaos may be psychological, as in \"On the Wolfsberg,\" or it may be lurking in the natural world, as in \"A Passage of the Frontier,\" or, as in the dark masterpiece \"The Chian Wine,\" it is suddenly discovered in the ancient, irrational impulses of human nature.The setting may be the marshes of western Ireland, the Pyrenees, or the claustrophobic confines of a clockmender's house, but each story is a showcase for Patrick O'Brian's fresh and meticulous prose; each story reaffirms his sympathetic understanding of human passion and suffering. This collection proves that O'Brian is not simply the master of a genre, but an author who will long be honored as one of our most eminent literary figures.",

        "Description": "This new edition of the Image classic, with more than 100,000 copies sold, brings E. Allison Peers's magnificent translation of St. John of the Cross's masterpiece Dark Night of the Soul to a new generation of readers and will renew the interest of those already familiar with its soaring poetry and timeless truths. The sixteenth-century Carmelite monk St. John of the Cross stands alongside St. Teresa of Avila as the West's best known and most beloved Christian mystic. As Peers writes in the Introduction to his definitive translation of Dark Night of the Soul, \"The most sublime of all Spanish mystics, he soars aloft on the wings of Divine love to heights known hardly to any of them... True to the character of his thought, his style is always forceful and energetic.\"Dark Night of the Soul follows the soul's journey from a state of abandonment and darkness to a loving union with God. In a voice at once grandiose and melodious, and a style that combines the systematic theology of St. Thomas Aquinas with rapturous poetry, St. John describes the process of moving away from routine religious rituals and embracing a Being who can be known only through love. His words, Peers writes, \"are a wonderful illustration of the theological truth that grace, far from destroying nature, ennobles and dignifies it, and of the agreement always found between the natural and the supernatural -- between the principles of sound reason and the sublime manifestations of Divine grace.\" One of the greatest contributions to the literature of mysticism, Dark Night of the Soul offers support and encouragement to all who seek oneness with God.",

Until now . . .Shortly after the change of the Millennium, in a tiny Mexican village, people of different faiths are flocking to Santa Pelagia from all over the planet to witness a miraculous visitation. Among them are twenty-four who experience something more personal: a messenger clothed in the raiments of his or her own beliefs--the Virgin Mary, an angel of Islam, the Hindu goddess Kali. And each is given the same terrifying message: the Day of Judgment is at hand.The Vatican sends Father Michele Deauchez to investigate. And Deauchez, caught up in the incredible experience, watches his palms run red with blood from the wounds of the stigmata. Yet, as a man of reason, a man deeply scarred by his own experience of the supernatural, he cannot--will not--believe.Simon Hill is an investigator of a different stripe. A top reporter for the New York Times, Hill has a nose for news--and Santa Pelagia smells like Pulitzer material. Especially when the portents foretold in the Book of Revelations--and now by the witnesses of Santa Pelagia, the so-called Twenty-Four--begin to come true. As Deauchez and Hill search ever deeper for the truth--penetrating the holiest councils of the Vatican, the boardrooms of powerful multinational corporations, and the highest reaches of the U.S. government and military--they begin to wonder: Is this phenomenon a case of mass hysteria . . . a devious, far-reaching plot . . . or has God truly spoken?This gripping novel vaults Jane Jensen into the front rank of suspense writers. A brilliant blend of ancient prophecy and vivid, complex characters, Millennium Rising is a terrifying, chillingly plausible thriller that will cling to you like a cold sweat and forever haunt your dreams.",

The murders couldn't be more gruesome. The method of killing is identical, the backgrounds of the girls very similar -- all are prostitutes. As the book opens, a seventh body is found, same modus operandi but the victim this time is a sweet young student. Anna stumbles on a vital piece of information that links one man to the killings, a well-known, much-loved actor. His protestation of innocence is convincing, and Anna might be succumbing to his flattering attention. What if he is arrested, the media erupts, and he is the wrong man?",

Reuters Africa correspondent Connie Burns suspects a British mercenary: a man who seems to turn up in every war-torn corner of Africa, whose reputation for violence and brutality is well-founded and widely known. Connie\u2019s suspicions that he\u2019s using the chaos of war to act out sadistic, misogynistic fantasies fall on deaf ears\u2014but she\u2019s determined to expose him and his secret.The consequences are devastating.Connie encounters the man again in Baghdad, but almost immediately she\u2019s taken hostage. Released after three desperate days, terrified and traumatized by the experience\u2014fearing that she will never again be the person she once was\u2014Connie retreats to England.  She is bent on protecting herself by withholding information about her abduction.

Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative.It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously.The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them \"graphic haiku,\" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional.As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and frailties -- our common humanity.Every day dozens of postcards still make their way to Frank, with postmarks from around the world, touching on every aspect of human experience. This extraordinary collection brings together the most powerful, personal, and beautifully intimate secrets Frank Warren has received -- and brilliantly illuminates that human emotions can be unique and universal at the same time.",

The title story finds him in a very dubious convalescent home battling a thin-lipped head nurse and befriending a junior one, Dotty. Though the death of an elderly patient is shrouded in secrecy, it is not until Rumpole is back in chambers that he learns of police suspicions-and of the murder charge against which he must defend young Dotty. Presuming Rumpole is soon to expire, Luci has been planning his memorial service, but the witty and irreverent Rumpole, sharp as ever, is far from hanging up his wig!",

He quickly learns that the young man is not a trusted \"member of the family\" but an FBI informant. A violent psychopath who kills and tortures for pleasure, Orsini will, if left unchecked, destroy everything in his path - friends, family, the Bureau itself.Dante's search takes him from D.C.'s drug-ravaged ghetto streets to the gilded penthouses of the nation's mob families, from the glittering casinos of Las Vegas and Atlantic City to the secret war councils of the FBI and D.C.'s mafia dons. What Dante finds is a world turned upside-down, where morality is measured in magnum bullets and a lust for revenge, where a blood-crazed federal informant can prove more dangerous than the mafia bosses he has been paid to put away and the government which falsely believes they can force him to serve their ends.",

Felix Tighe's laser-focused, obsessive hatred of Karp has simmered during his prison confinement, where he has spent time with Feisal Abdel Ridwan, a radical Islamic fundamentalist -- and their sordid connection only fuels his loathing of Karp. Now out of prison, with an assumed identity, and dangerously seeking payback, Felix stalks Karp to the very heart of his family as he plans a demonic assault on Karp's daughter, Lucy.  Rippling with action, and full of Tanenbaum's trademark twists and turns, Resolved is a must-read novel which roils with post 9-11 malevolence and searing New York scenes. As Karp faces his toughest assignment yet -- and with his fearless and complex private detective wife Marlene Ciampi at his side -- Resolved builds to an almost unbearable climax at Karp's \"office,\" Manhattan's central courthouse.",

When she finds the freshly killed body of a stranger on her doorstep, her initial shock turns to an irresistible thirst for the blood surrounding the body, for Jenn is a hemophage: her life depends on feeding on the blood of \"normals.\" Until now, Jenn has survived by transfusing blood from sleeping victims, harmlessly. With bone-chilling certainty, she recognizes that this body has been left as an invitation to reclaim her destiny of taking blood by deadly force. And only one person would have left the body for her - her father, Zane.Beginning with cruel pranks to remind her of his powers, Zane soon commits a murder that brings Jenn to the brink of exposure - or death. Unjustly imprisoned for murder, and facing the possibility of dying without a supply of fresh blood, Jenn decides she must escape and use her unearthly powers to defeat Zane once and for all.",

We kidnap a human child and replace him or her with one of our own. . . .\u201dThe double story of Henry Day begins in 1949, when he is kidnapped at age seven by a band of wild childlike beings who live in an ancient, secret community in the forest. The changelings rename their captive Aniday and he becomes, like them, unaging and stuck in time. They leave one of their own to take his place, an imposter who must try\u2013with varying success\u2013to hide his true identity from the Day family. As the changeling Henry grows up, he is haunted by glimpses of his lost double and by vague memories of his own childhood a century earlier. Narrated in turns by Henry and Aniday, The Stolen Child follows them as their lives converge, driven by their obsessive search for who they were before they changed places in the world.  Moving from a realistic setting in small-town America deep into the forest of humankind\u2019s most basic desires and fears, this remarkable novel is a haunting fable about identity and the illusory innocence of childhood.",

With 75 complete meal menus, packaged in the same attractive spiral, lay-flat hardcover format as Blend It!, here's a healthy and original approach to this hotter-then-hot diet plan. The low-carb life just keeps getting more and more popular, but many dieters aren't sure how to make the switch. What will they be allowed to eat? Will they feel hungry? Will they be forced to consume a dinner that consists only of beef with a side of beef? Good Housekeeping offers help, with healthy suppers that don't sacrifice variety or flavor. Choose from meat, poultry, fish, and eggs, cheese and vegetable selections--all main dishes accompanied by appropriate carb-balanced sides. The number of carbs per recipe is 20 grams or lower, with a recommended meal's total never exceeding a 28-gram carb count.But what truly makes Smart Carb Suppers unique, and sets it apart from any other book on the subject, is its organization. The recipes for each meal all appear on the same spread, a design that proved very successful for Pierre Franey's 60 Minute Gourmet cookbook. Fifty-five of these delicious meals feature two recipes per dinner, and 20 have three recipes.Best of all, the experts from the world's best test kitchens provide welcome information on good carbs and bad carbs, what you need to know about diet plans, and other important nutrition and health information.",
