The story of Victor Frankenstein's terrible creation and the havoc it caused has enthralled generations of readers and inspired countless writers of horror and suspense. Considering the novel's enduring success, it is remarkable that it began merely as a whim of Lord Byron's.\"We will each write a story,\" Byron announced to his next-door neighbors, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and her lover Percy Bysshe Shelley. The friends were summering on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland in 1816, Shelley still unknown as a poet and Byron writing the third canto of Childe Harold. When continued rains kept them confined indoors, all agreed to Byron's proposal.The illustrious poets failed to complete their ghost stories, but Mary Shelley rose supremely to the challenge. With Frankenstein, she succeeded admirably in the task she set for herself: to create a story that, in her own words, \"would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature and awaken thrilling horror \u2014 one to make the reader dread to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart.\"",

        "Description": "As a governor of the Federal Reserve Board from 1996 to 2002, Laurence H. Meyer helped make the economic policies that steered the United States through some of the wildest and most tumultuous times in its recent history. Now, in A Term at the Fed, Governor Meyer provides an insider's view of the Fed, the decisions that affected both the U.S. and world economies, and the challenges inherent in using monetary policy to guide the economy.When Governor Meyer was appointed by President Clinton to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 1996, the United States was entering one of the most prosperous periods in its history. It was the time of \"irrational exuberance\" and the fabled New Economy. Soon, however, the economy was tested by the Asian financial crisis, the Russian default and devaluation, the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the bursting of America's stock bubble, and the terrorist attacks of 9/11.In what amounts to a definitive playbook of monetary policy, Meyer now relives the Fed's closed-door debates -- debates that questioned how monetary policy should adapt to the possibility of a New Economy, how the Fed should respond to soaring equity prices, and whether the Fed should broker the controversial private sector bailout of LTCM, among other issues. Meyer deftly weaves these issues with firsthand stories about the personalities involved, from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to the various staffers, governors, politicians, and reporters that populate the world of the Fed.Since the end of his term, Meyer has continued to watch the Fed and the world economy. He believes that we are witnessing a repetition of some of the events of the remarkable 1990s -- including a further acceleration in productivity and perhaps another bull market. History does not repeat itself, yet Meyer shows us how the lessons learned yesterday may help the Fed shape policy today.",

        "Title": "Scandalmonger: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Safire, William",
        "Description": "A presidential hopeful has taken a beautiful, vulnerable woman as his mistress, though both are married to others. His rival for the presidency of the United States has even more sensational secrets to guard about his own past. An ambitious journalist unearths the stories of the private lives of both, and he hefts in his hand what he calls \"the hammer of truth.\"  The time is the end of the eighteenth century. The political figures whose intimate lives are about to be revealed are Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. The journalist out to shape the course of the young nation's history is \"that scurrilous scoundrel Callender,\" the fugitive from Scottish sedition law who pioneered the public exposure of men in power. The women he makes famous are the mysterious Maria Reynolds and the slave Sally Hemings.  The novelist and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist William Safire brings these real characters in our history to life. He recounts the dramatic clash of the Founders and the first journalists -- drawn from actual events of the nation's beginnings -- that has special relevance for our time. Scandalmonger is dramatized history at its best and presidential politics at its most fascinating.  For those who think that Washington sex scandals and lurid journalism are recent developments, this novel will be a revelation, for Safire shows vividly how media intrusiveness into private lives -- and politicians' cool manipulation of the press -- are as old as the Constitution.  The \"scandalmonger\" of the title is James Thomson Callender, a writer with a poisonous quill pen who is secretly on the payroll of Vice President Jefferson. When Callender publishes documents leaked to him about a secret Congressional investigation into Treasury Secretary Hamilton's financial dealings, Hamilton counters with a confession of an affair with the blackmailing Mrs. Reynolds -- admitting to a sin but not a crime.  Callender's scathing newspaper attacks on Hamilton and on President John Adams as a \"hoary-headed incendiary\" so incensed the Federalists in power that they enacted the Sedition Act to crush freedom of speech. The scandalmonger was convicted and jailed, but his widely reported martyrdom after an unfair trial angered many voters and helped to sweep the Jeffersonians into power.  The new President pardoned his partisan publicist but refused to reward him -- indeed, cut him off in favor of less divisive supporters. Broke and betrayed, Callender set out to wreak vengeance on his former hero by breaking the story of Jefferson's fathering of children with his slave Sally Hemings -- an account that would be scornfully disbelieved until largely authenticated by DNA evidence almost two centuries later.  Central to the story of Scandalmonger is the enigmatic allure of Maria Reynolds, a haunting adventuress who in real life bedazzled both Hamilton and his arch-enemy, Aaron Burr, and, in this novel, attracted the reviled scandalmonger as well.  Much of the dialogue of Presidents Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe is drawn from their letters. The accounts of libel and sedition trials to suppress the opinions of Callender and his bombastic newspaper antagonist, \"Peter Porcupine,\" are accurate. Hamilton's passionate and ironic defense of freedom of the press is true (although the notes of his speech were fleshed out by Safire, a former White House speechwriter). In a unique \"Underbook,\" the author scrupulously sets forth his scholarly sources, separating fiction from dramatized history -- and in so leveling with the reader, truly re-creates the passionate controversies of an era that presages our times.",

        "Description": "The body, at least what was left of it, was drifting in Havana Bay the morning Arkady arrived from Moscow. Only the day before, he had received an urgent message from the Russian embassy in Havana that his friend Pribluda was missing and asking that he come.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cubans insisted that this corpse floating in an inner tube was Pribluda, but Arkady wasn't so sure. \u00a0\u00a0  \"You don't investigate assault, you don't investigate murder. Just what do you investigate?\" Arkady asks Ofelia Osorio, a detective in the Polic\u00eda Nacional de la Revoluci\u00f3n. \"Or is it simply open season on Russians in Havana?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The comrades of the Cold War have parted bitterly, and the Russians who used to swarm through Havana's streets are now as rare as they are despised, much more so than Americans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Havana is overrun with color, music, and suspicion. The Revolution's heroes have outlived idealism. The Com-munist world has shrunk to Cuba. Paradise has become a stop on sex tours. It is a city of empty stores and talking drums, Karl Marx and sharp machetes, where an American radical rides around in Hemingway's car to tout island investments and a Wall Street developer on the run from the FBI flies a pirate flag.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A dead Russian, a live Russian,\" Ofelia says. \"What's the difference?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the dead Russian is followed by the murders of a Cuban boxer and a prostitute. Although none of them is supposed to be investigated, Arkady cannot be stopped. He speaks no Spanish, knows nothing about Cuba, and, as a Russian, is a pariah. However, there is something about this faded, lovely, dangerous city--the rhythms of waves against the seawall, the insinuation of music always in the air, and, finally, Ofelia herself--that plunges Arkady back into life.\"What ultimately sets the Renko books apart is the careful writing, and, more important, the knowledge of the human heart that is carried through it, through them, first to last.\"--Chicago Tribune",

        "Title": "101 Poems That Could Save Your Life: An Anthology of Emotional First Aid",
        "Authors": "By Goodwin, Daisy (EDT)",
        "Description": "Prozac has side effects, drinking gives you hangovers, therapy's expensive. For quick and effective relief -- or at least some literary comfort -- from everyday and exceptional problems, try a poem. Over the ages, people have turned to poets as ambassadors of the emotions, because they give voice and definition to our troubles, and by so doing, ease them. No matter how bad things get, poets have been there, too, and they can help you get over the rough spots.This is the first poetry anthology designed expressly for the self-help generation. The poems listed include classics by Emily Dickinson, Lord Byron, Ogden Nash, and Lucretius, to name just a few, along with newer works by such current practitioners as Seamus Heaney and Wendy Cope. This book has a cure or consolation for nearly every affliction, ancient or modern. And no side effects-except pleasure.",

        "Authors": "By Goldberg, Bernard",
        "Description": "The number one New York Times bestselling author of Bias delivers another bombshell\u2014this time aimed at . . .100 People Who Are Screwing Up AmericaNo preaching. No pontificating. Just some uncommon sense about the things that have made this country great\u2014and the culprits who are screwing it up.Bernard Goldberg takes dead aim at the America Bashers (the cultural elites who look down their snobby noses at \"ordinary\" Americans) . . . the Hollywood Blowhards (incredibly ditzy celebrities who think they're smart just because they're famous) . . . the TV Schlockmeisters (including the one whose show has been compared to a churning mass of maggots devouring rotten meat) . . . the Intellectual Thugs (bigwigs at some of our best colleges, whose views run the gamut from left wing to far left wing) . . . and many more.Goldberg names names, counting down the villains in his rogues' gallery from 100 all the way to 1\u2014and, yes, you-know-who is number 37. Some supposedly \"serious\" journalists also made the list, including the journalist-diva who sold out her integrity and hosted one of the dumbest hours in the history of network television news. And there are those famous miscreants who have made America a nastier place than it ought to be\u2014a far more selfish, vulgar, and cynical place.But Goldberg doesn't just round up the usual suspects we have come to know and detest. He also exposes some of the people who operate away from the limelight but still manage to pull a lot of strings and do all sorts of harm to our culture. Most of all, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America is about a country where as long as anything goes, as one of the good guys in the book puts it, sooner or later everything will go.This is serious stuff for sure. But Goldberg will also make you laugh as he harpoons scoundrels like the congresswoman who thinks there aren't enough hurricanes named after black people, and the environmentalist to the stars who yells at total strangers driving SUVs\u2014even though she tools around the country in a gas-guzzling private jet.With Bias, Bernard Goldberg took us behind the scenes and exposed the way Big Journalism distorts the news. Now he has written a book that goes even further. This time he casts his eye on American culture at large\u2014and the result is a book that is sure to become the voice of all those Americans who feel that no one is speaking for them on perhaps the most vital issue of all: the kind of country in which we want to live.",

After seeing their son, Jack, leave to fight in the war, they are confronted with an eviction notice from the United States government, which is expanding a bombing and gunnery range to include their land and home. As they fight to preserve their ranch, an illicit affair and murder threaten to rip the family apart.A world away, Jack is caught in the Pacific Theater of War, where the Allies have suffered devastating loss and defeat. He endures the horrors of the Bataan Death March and Japanese prison camps, hoping to survive long enough to make it home.In the Shadows of the Sun illustrates America's journey through the war and postwar period, a passage lit by the fierce glare of the atomic bomb. At once a portrait of the desolate beauty of the Southwest and a lament about the very personal tragedy of war, this novel delves into the nature of family, sacrifice, and that which binds us together in the face of unforgiving circumstances and tragedy.",

        "Authors": "By Houppert, Karen",
        "Description": "As taps echoes across the cookie-cutter housing areas of upstate New York\u2019s Fort Drum, the wives turn on the evening news, both hoping for and dreading word of their husbands overseas. It\u2019s a ritual played out on military bases across the nation as the waiting wives of Karen Houppert\u2019s extraordinary new book endure a long, lonely, and difficult year with their husbands far from home. Houppert, a prize winning journalist, spent a year among these women, joining them as they had babies, raised families, ran Cub Scout troops, coached soccer\u2013and went to funerals.The waiting wives include Lauren, twenty-six, whose Navy SEAL husband was killed in Afghanistan; Heidi, peace activist and Army wife whose life is a daily struggle with her conscience; Crystal, a nineteen-year-old raising two babies on a shoestring while her husband fights in the Middle East; Tabitha, who becomes the alleged victim of murderous domestic violence at the hands of her Special Operations boyfriend; and Danette, once an Army brat and now a devoted Air Force wife, who teaches, raises two teens, and fills her days with endless volunteer work.Houppert shows that these women make some of the same sacrifices of their personal liberties as their husbands do and yet garner none of the respect accorded their spouses. Today, these military wives find themselves torn between an entrenched tradition that would keep them in a Leave It to Beaver family ideal and a modern social climate suggesting that women are entitled to more\u2013a career of their own, self-determination, and a true parenting partner.Meanwhile, the military concocts family-friendly policies and spends millions on new programs designed to appease military wives\u2013and to maintain them as staunch supporters who will encourage their husbands\u2019 reenlistment. The Army likes to say that it \u201crecruits soldiers, but retains families.\u201d And indeed, the future of the all-volunteer force hinges on the success of this mission. Though Army brass speak glowingly of the \u201cArmy Family Team,\u201d this team is often deeply divided over strategy\u2013and even goals. A gritty, behind-the-scenes look at the tour of duty from the domestic front, Home Fires Burning provides a fascinating, fresh look at an enormous American institution and the families that live in its shadow.",

Ten years later, he revised his argument: we hadn't reached the end of history, he wrote, because we hadn't yet reached the end of science. Arguing that our greatest advances still to come will be in the life sciences, Fukuyama now asks how the ability to modify human behavior will affect liberal democracy.To re-orient contemporary debate, Fukuyama underlines man's changing understanding of human nature through history: from Plato and Aristotle's belief that man had \"natural ends,\" to the ideals of utopians and dictators of the modern age who sought to remake mankind for ideological ends. Fukuyama persuasively argues that the ultimate prize of the biotechnology revolution-intervention in the \"germ-line,\" the ability to manipulate the DNA of all of one person's descendents-will have profound, and potentially terrible, consequences for our political order, even if undertaken by ordinary parents seeking to \"improve\" their children.In Our Posthuman Future, our greatest social philosopher begins to describe the potential effects of exploration on the foundation of liberal democracy: the belief that human beings are equal by nature.Francis Fukuyama is Bernard Schwartz Professor of International Political Economy at the Paul H.

Rarely has someone entering the policy arena so eloquently and precisely laid out the case for political control of emerging technology.\"\u2014Robert Lee Hotz,Los Angeles Times Book Review\"Fukuyama gives a fascinating tour of the post-human sciences and their implications, free of the dogma from both sides of the political spectrum that has accumulated around these breakthroughs. Fukuyama accepts the premise that life-prolonging technologies will push many citizens of industrialized countries into their second century of life. But because the developing world will still be feeling the effects of its recent population explosion, the result will be a planet divided along heretofore unimaginable demographic lines, 'with Europe, Japan, and parts of North America having a median age of nearly 60 and their less-developed neighbors having median ages somewhere in their early 20s.' Fukuyama also displays a refreshing skepticism about the prospects for genetic engineering, arguing persuasively that scientists still know too little about the ways in which genes control phenotypic expression to manipulate our genetic heritage in the near future, at least where complex attributes such as intelligence or memory are concerned.\"\u2014Steven Johnson, The Washington Post\"Fukuyama has taken a stunning step forward with this exploration not only of the ins and outs of a designer-baby future, but also of the politics and the political philosophy of a world in which advances in biotechnology fundamentally shape who we are as human beings. If this all sounds a little rarefied for some tastes, the genius of Our Posthuman Futureis that it brings home just how important it will be in our immediate future for ordinary people to explore such questions.\"\u2014San Francisco Chronicle\"Fukuyama seeks to develop a principled middle way between the extremes of scientific libertarianism and an unrealistic idealism . . . Whether or not one accepts Fukuyama's overall argument, his practical recommendations may well hold out the best prospect for promoting a reasonable balance between a rapidly evolving field of science and the moral views of the American people.\"\u2014William A. Galston,The Public Interest\"In this groundbreaking inquiry, Fukuyama warns that advances in drugs and genetic engineering will allow society to control human behavior and manipulate physical characteristics\u2014and this power could alter our understanding of what it means to be human . . . In a contentious and fast-moving policy area, Fukuyama provides a remarkably sensible and human vision of what is at stake and what needs to be done.\"\u2014Foreign Affairs\"A well-written and accessible discussion of advances in biotechnology and their social, ethical, legal and regulatory implications.\"\u2014Dan W.

But running low on money and concerned that her writing might lack a depth and darkness, she takes a job teaching creative writing -- at a maximum-security prison. It is a world she has never experienced before, one ruled by enigmatic codes of honor, ceaseless aggression and absolutely savage violence.But one of the prisoners there is unlike any of the others, and unlike any man she has ever met before. Vance Harrow is unique. He is soft-spoken, charismatic and brilliantly talented. Two things trouble Ivy deeply. First, she suspects that Harrow shouldn't be in prison at all. He possesses an intellect that separates him from the other inmates and a selflessness that might just get him killed. Second, he has at the same time deep reservoirs of rage and brutality that seem perfectly in line with the other prisoners -- a dichotomy Ivy finds difficult to reconcile.Trying to understand the complex picture, perhaps even get some recognition for a writer as gifted as Harrow seems to be, Ivy begins to ask questions. How did such a man end up in prison in the first place? Is he truly guilty? If not, who could have been responsible for putting him there, and why hasn't he tried harder to free himself? But the more questions Ivy asks to free a man she believes to be innocent, the more attention she draws to herself. Soon other people begin to ask questions -- about Ivy Seidel.In the span of just a few days, Ivy's life will be completely turned upside down. What begins as an inquiry into one man's innocence may explode into a love affair, and what begins as an obsession to save one man's life might just end up costing Ivy her own.",

People are interacting more frequently and more fervently than ever before, turning the English language into an indecipherable mess. Now, this unique and concise compendium presents the most confused and misused words in the language today -- words misused by careless speakers and writers everywhere.  It defines, discerns and distinguishes the finer points of sense and meaning. Was it fortuitous or only fortunate? Are you trying to remember, or more fully recollect? Is he uninterested or disinterested? Is it healthful or healthy, regretful or regrettable, notorious or infamous? The answers to these and many more fascinating etymological questions can be found within the pages of this invaluable (or is it valuable?) reference.",

Ask them about the in and outs of the British Royal Family, or what happened to Brad and Jennifer and you'll find they're pretty clued in. These facts, or events, or factoids, mysteriously capture the world's attention and creates a media frenzy.But there's a flip side to this. Fog Facts \u2014 the important things that nobody seems able to focus on anymore than they can focus on a single droplet in the mist. They are known, but not known; the sort of things that journalists and political junkies know, but somehow the world does not. Such as President Bush's war record (he doesn't have one), or how Dick Cheney became that rich. Who really won the election in Florida 2000 and how many people have perished since the invasion of Iraq.Beinhart's book is a dazzling and unsettling exploration of how this has come to pass, about \"The Soft Machine,\" a mysterious mechanism that manufactures consent in a so-called democratic society and how ordinary citizens can fight back.",

        "Description": "The 400 years covered by this volume saw two Danish invasions and the Norman Conquest of England. Each conquest carried with it extensive political and social changes. Alfred began the work of creating a unified kingdom out of the shambles of the smaller kingdoms that had fallen under Viking raids. The ninth and tenth centuries saw the settlement of the Danes and the eleventh the emergence of a strong monarchy under the Danish King Cnut. \"With the English kingdom grew up the first semblance of national institutions,\" writes Professor Brooks--institutions of central and local government which made the English monarchy among the most mature in the Europe of its time.... These established institutions were not destroyed by the Normans; they adapted and developed them.Although England had had close ties with the continent before the Conquest, after 1066 English cultural and social life was greatly enriched through the French influence. During this time the Church was finding new inspiration in monastic and papal reform and a great intellectual revival culminated in the creation of universities. Professor Brooke describes all the cultural and political developments of these years and shows how the reign of Henry III ushered in a \"great age of art and architecture\" and a \"new attitude to government,\" which began to work by consent of the governed.",

        "Title": "Stealing Time: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Collapse of AOL Time Warner",
        "Authors": "By Klein, Alec",
        "Description": "In January 2000, America Online and Time Warner announced the largest merger in U.S. history, a deal that would create the biggest media company in the world. It was celebrated as the marriage of new media and old media, a potent combination of the nation's No. 1 Internet company and the country's leading entertainment giant, the owner of such internationally renowned brands as Warner Bros., HBO, CNN, and Time magazine.  But only three years later, nearly all the top executives behind the merger had resigned, the company had lost tens of billions of dollars in market value, and the U.S. government had begun two investigations into its business dealings.  How did the deal of the century become an epic disaster?  Alec Klein has covered AOL Time Warner for The Washington Post since the merger. His reporting on the company led to investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In Stealing Time, he takes readers behind the scenes to show how a clash of cultures set the stage for a spectacular corporate collapse. AOL's Steve Case knew it was only a matter of time before the Internet bubble of the late 1990s would burst, grounding his high-flying company. His solution: Buy another company to keep his own aloft. Meanwhile, Time Warner's Jerry Levin was enamored of new technology but frustrated by his inability to push his far-flung media empire into the Internet age. AOL and Time Warner seemed like a perfect match.  But the government forced the two companies to make concessions, and during the yearlong negotiations technology stocks tumbled. AOL executives lorded it over their Time Warner counterparts, who felt they were being acquired by brash, young interlopers with inflated dollars. The AOL way was fast, loose, and aggressive, and Time Warner executives -- schooled in more genteel business practices -- rebelled. In the midst of clashing cultures and conflicting management styles, AOL's business slowed and then stalled. Worse yet, AOL came under government scrutiny, and when the company conducted its own internal investigation, it admitted that it had improperly booked at least $190 million in revenue. The Time Warner rebellion gathered momentum.  This is a riveting story of ambition, hubris, and greed set amid the boom-and-bust years of the technology bubble. It is filled with outsized personalities -- Steve Case, Jerry Levin, Bob Pittman, Ted Turner, and many more. Based on hundreds of confidential company documents and interviews with key players in this unfolding drama, Stealing Time is a fascinating tale of the swift rise and even swifter fall of AOL Time Warner.",

        "Authors": "By Heymann, C. David",
        "Description": "In this definitive portrait of the political and social life of Georgetown, bestselling biographer C. David Heymann chronicles the dinner parties, correspondence, overlappings, and underpinnings of some of the most influential women in Washington's history.  \"The Georgetown Ladies' Social Club\" -- a term coined by Ronald Reagan -- comprises a list of formidable and fascinating women, among them Katharine Graham, Lorraine Cooper, Evangeline Bruce, Pamela Harriman, and Sally Quinn. Their husbands, government officials and newsmakers among them, relied on the ladies for their sharp wit and sensitivity, refined bearings, and congeniality. In a city characteristically and traditionally controlled by men, the Georgetown wives were, in turn, afforded an abundance of behind-the-scenes political clout.  Filled with intriguing and often startling insights into Washington life, from the latter days of the Kennedy and Truman administrations to the Clinton era and the advent of President George W. Bush, The Georgetown Ladies' Social Club is a compelling testament to the sex, lies, and red tape of American politics.",

        "Title": "God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It",
        "Authors": "By Wallis, Jim",
        "Description": "Since when did believing in God and having moral values make you pro-war, pro-rich, and pro-Republican? And since when did promoting and pursuing a progressive social agenda with a concern for economic security, health care, and educational opportunity mean you had to put faith in God aside?While the Right in America has hijacked the language of faith to prop up its political agenda\u2014an agenda not all people of faith support\u2014the Left hasn't done much better, largely ignoring faith and continually separating moral discourse and personal ethics from public policy. While the Right argues that God's way is their way, the Left pursues an unrealistic separation of religious values from morally grounded political leadership. The consequence is a false choice between ideological religion and soulless politics.The effect of this dilemma was made clear in the 2004 presidential election. The Democrats' miscalculations have left them despairing and searching for a way forward. It has become clear that someone must challenge the Republicans' claim that they speak for God, or that they hold a monopoly on moral values in the nation's public life. Wallis argues that America's separation of church and state does not require banishing moral and religious values from the public square. In fact, the very survival of America's social fabric depends on such values and vision to shape our politics\u2014a dependence the nation's founders recognized.God's Politics offers a clarion call to make both our religious communities and our government more accountable to key values of the prophetic religious tradition\u2014that is, make them pro-justice, pro-peace, pro-environment, pro-equality, pro-consistent ethic of life (beyond single issue voting), and pro-family (without making scapegoats of single mothers or gays and lesbians). Our biblical faith and religious traditions simply do not allow us as a nation to continue to ignore the poor and marginalized, deny racial justice, tolerate the ravages of war, or turn away from the human rights of those made in the image of God. These are the values of love and justice, reconciliation, and community that Jesus taught and that are at the core of what many of us believe, Christian or not. In the tradition of prophets such as Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day, and Desmond Tutu, Wallis inspires us to hold our political leaders and policies accountable by integrating our deepest moral convictions into our nation's public life.",

She despises school, likes to get high, and enjoys making other people squirm in response to her pranks.Angela (Dulcie's mother) is approaching forty and feels her life spinning out of control. Her husband is having an affair and her daughter disappears at odd hours of the night. Exhausted with worry over just about everything, Angela decides to enlist the help of her ex-husband in dealing with Dulcie.Stephen, quiet and introspective, is still in love with Angela, but he has managed, slowly, to move on without her. When she calls to announce that she is driving Dulcie to the small Iowa farm - where the family began and after five years fell apart - Stephen becomes obsessed by what Angela's reaction will be to the house, which he has kept exactly the same since she left.Gently, imperceptibly, Boswell leads us into a maze of family dynamics where the reader is entranced and frequently surprised - and experiences flashes of recognition at every turn.",

It is a world of synthetic memory drugs, benevolent government surveillance, underground anarchists, and talking canine companions. Power is in the hands of conservative senior citizens who have watched their health and capital investments with equal care, gaining access to the latest advancements in life-extension technology. Meanwhile, the young live on the fringes of society, eking out a meager survival on free government-issued rations and a black market in stolen technological gadgetry from an earlier, less sophisticated age.Mia Ziemann is a ninety-four-year-old medical economist who enjoys all the benefits of her position. But a deathbed visit with a long-ago ex-lover and a chance meeting with a young bohemian dress designer brings Mia to an awful revelation. She has lived her life with such caution that it has been totally bereft of pleasure and adventure. She has one chance to do it all over. But first she must submit herself to a radical - and painful - experimental procedure that promises to make her young again. The procedure is not without risk and her second chance at life will not come without a price. And afterward she will have to escape her team of medical keepers.Hitching a ride on a plane to Europe, Mia sets out on a wild intercontinental quest in search of spiritual gratification, erotic revelation, and the thing she missed most of all: the holy fire of the creative experience. She joins a group of outlaw anarchists whose leader may be the man of her dreams - or her undoing. Worst of all, Mia will have to undergo one last radical procedure that could cost her a second life.",

        "Authors": "By Will, George F.",
        "Description": "The world's oldest democracy - ours - has an old tradition of skepticism about government. However, the degree of dismay about government today is perhaps unprecedented in our history. Americans are particularly convinced that Congress has become irresponsible, either unwilling or incapable of addressing the nation's problems - while it spends its time and our money on extending its members' careers. Many Americans have come to believe fundamental reform is needed, specifically limits on the number of terms legislators can serve.In Restoration, George Will makes a compelling case, drawn from our history and his close observance of Congress, that term limits are now necessary to revive the traditional values of classical republican government, to achieve the Founders' goal of deliberative democracy, and to restore Congress to competence and its rightful dignity as the First Branch of government. At stake, Will says, is the vitality of America's great promise self-government under representative institutions. At issue is the meaning of representation. The morality of representative government, Will argues, does not merely permit, it requires representatives to exercise independent judgment rather than merely execute instructions given by constituents. However, careerism, which is a consequence of the professionalization of politics, has made legislators servile and has made the national legislature incapable of rational, responsible behavior. Term limits would restore the constitutional space intended by the Founders, the healthy distance between the electors and the elected that is necessary for genuine deliberation about the public interest.Blending the political philosophy of the Founders with alarming facts about the behavior of legislative careerists, Restoration demonstrates how term limits, by altering the motives of legislators, can narrow the gap between the theory and the practice of American democracy.",

To the extent that craving is the human condition and commentary the Jewish position, the stories in Neurotica capture a wide range of sexual experience while also probing conflicts and enduring connections between the sexes. It includes straight sex, gay sex, married and unmarried sex, satisfied and frustrated sex, guilty and innocent sex, carnal, platonic, and pathetic sex. Some of the stories are graphic, some ethereal, some hilarious, some tragic. From the cool analysis of Rebecca Goldstein, for whom seduction is a branch of philosophy, to Harold Brodkey's amazing thirty-page description of a single sex act, to fiction by younger writers like Nathan Englander and S. L. Wisenberg beside excerpts from groundbreaking works like Erica Jong's Fear of Flying and Philip Roth's The Counterlife, Neurotica is fiction (and obsession) at its best. Other contributors include Woody Allen, Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, Henry Roth, Cynthia Ozick, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Francine Prose, and Jerzy Kosinski. Neurotica provides entry into intimate dreams and imaginations that can be appreciated by anyone of any faith--or no faith--who has ever had or wished to have sex.",

But when her husband leaves her for his masseuse, suddenly she's a single mother of three, with no particular skills, living in the sticks and calling upon all her wit and resourcefulness to hold together her newly lopsided family. Hens Dancing follows Venetia's diaries over the course of a year as she tries to make the best of things, for her children and for herself. Venetia's battles are everyday ones - the house is crumbling and the garden a disaster, joint custody is traumatic for everyone concerned, and there's never enough money. But there are consolations: the kaleidoscopic loveliness of the Norfolk seasons, a houseful of animals, nighttime picnics, the regal serenity of Venetia's baby daughter - called simply The Beauty - and a new family closeness that has flowered amid the chaos. And perhaps, unexpectedly, the promise of new love.",
