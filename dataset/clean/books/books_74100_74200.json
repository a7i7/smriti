Most contemporary accounts placed the blame for the tragedy squarely on the shoulders of the Confederates who administered the prison or on a conspiracy of higher-ranking officials. According to William Marvel, virulent disease and severe shortages of vegetables, medical supplies, and other necessities combined to create a crisis beyond the captors' control. He also argues that the tragedy was aggravated by the Union decision to suspend prisoner exchanges, which meant that many men who might have returned home were instead left to sicken and die in captivity.",

The novels of D. W. Buffa featuring attorney Joseph Antonelli have become some of the most avidly praised of the legal thrillers being written today, called \"absorbing\" (Orlando Sentinel), \"suspense-laden\" (Houston Chronicle), and \"electrically charged\" (The New York Times). The Judgment, the third in the series, was nominated for the Edgar Award for Best Novel of the Year.  In Breach of Trust, Antonelli is seduced into taking a case that has dangerous implications not only for the upcoming United States presidential race but also for a group of friends who thought they had put the sudden death of a young woman behind them long ago. When Antonelli attends a Harvard Law School reunion at Manhattan's Plaza Hotel, he doesn't suspect how disturbing his return will be-for it was at a party in this very hotel that a lively young woman fell from a window to her death. The event had been ruled an accident at the time, but the case is about to be reopened, and a possible witness is wary of its potential to ruin his political chances-a man with promise and ambition in equal measure, the vice president of the United States. When the trial begins, the nation's eyes turn to the accused, the downtrodden James Haviland, and to the unseen powers both within and without the White House who want to bury him. It's up to the shrewd and sharp Antonelli to uncover just where the secrets lie-and exactly who is playing whom.",

And then, of course, there is the tall and gorgeous hunk, Ryder McQuaid, Jeanette Sue's property. Or so Jeanette Sue thinks.With uncanny insight and unforgettable characters Francine Pascal has created a searing, up-close look into the power games and class struggles within a seemingly friendly clique in a suburban high school.

It is a truly special story and we don\u2019t want to spoil it. Nevertheless, you need to know something, so we will just say this: It is extremely funny, but the African beach scene is horrific. The story starts there, but the book doesn\u2019t. And it\u2019s what happens afterward that is most important. Once you have read it, you\u2019ll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don\u2019t tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds.",

        "Description": "From the bestselling author of the \"dazzling historical saga\" (The Washington Post), Moloka'i, comes the irresistible story of a young immigrant bride in a ramshackle town that becomes a great modern city \"In Korea in those days, newborn girls were not deemed important enough to be graced with formal names, but were instead given nicknames, which often reflected the parents' feelings on the birth of a daughter:  I knew a girl named Anger, and another called Pity.  As for me, my parents named me Regret.\"Honolulu is the rich, unforgettable story of a young \"picture bride\" who journeys to Hawai'i in 1914 in search of a better life.Instead of the affluent young husband and chance at an education that she has been promised, she is quickly married off to a poor, embittered laborer who takes his frustrations out on his new wife. Renaming herself Jin, she makes her own way in this strange land, finding both opportunity and prejudice. With the help of three of her fellow picture brides, Jin prospers along with her adopted city, now growing from a small territorial capital into the great multicultural city it is today.  But paradise has its dark side, whether it's the daily struggle for survival in Honolulu's tenements, or a crime that will become the most infamous in the islands' history...With its passionate knowledge of people and places in Hawai'i far off the tourist track, Honolulu is most of all the spellbinding tale of four women in a new world, united by dreams, disappointment, sacrifices, and friendship.",
