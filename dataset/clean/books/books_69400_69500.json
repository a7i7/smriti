But maps need not just show continents and oceans: there are maps to heaven and hell; to happiness and despair; maps of moods, matrimony, and mythological places. There are maps to popular culture, from Gulliver's Island to Gilligan's Island. There are speculative maps of the world before it was known, and maps to secret places known only to the mapmaker. Artists' maps show another kind of uncharted realm: the imagination. What all these maps have in common is their creators' willingness to venture beyond the boundaries of geography or convention.You Are Here is a wide-ranging collection of such superbly inventive maps. These are charts of places you're not expected to find, but a voyage you take in your mind: an exploration of the ideal country estate from a dog's perspective; a guide to buried treasure on Skeleton Island; a trip down the road to success; or the world as imagined by an inmate of a mental institution. With over 100 maps from artists, cartographers, and explorers, You are Here gives the reader a breath-taking view of worlds, both real and imaginary.",

Autumn 1918: Rumors of peace are spreading across America, but spreading even faster are the first cases of Spanish influenza, whispering of the epidemic to come. Maureen Ross, well past a safe childbearing age, is experiencing a difficult pregnancy. Her husband, Troop-cold and careless of her condition-is an emotional cripple who has battered her spirit throughout their marriage. As Maureen's time grows near, she becomes convinced she will die in childbirth. Into this loveless m\u00e9nage arrives Mary Oliver, Troop's niece. The sheltered child of a well-to-do, freethinking Washington family, Mary comes to help Maureen in the last weeks of her confinement. Horrified by Troop's bullying, she soon discovers that her true duty is to protect her aunt.  As the influenza spreads and the death toll grows, Troop's spiteful behaviors worsen. Tormenting his wife, taunting her for her \"low birth,\" hiding her mother's letters, Troop terrorizes the household. But when Mary fights back, he begins to go over the edge, and Maureen rallies, releasing a stunning thunderstorm of confrontation and, ultimately, finding spiritual renewal.  The Boston Globe hailed On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon as \"another gift from Kaye Gibbons to the literature celebrating strong women of every age and era.\" Much the same can be said of Divining Women.",

        "Authors": "By Schaller, Lyle E.",
        "Description": "One of the most crucial changes in North American life, Lyle E. Schaller explains, has been the shift from small to large institutions. Sixty years ago one-teacher, one-room schoolhouses still abounded, and the average number of students in all American schools was one hundred. Now new construction on elementary schools is often for facilities that will accommodate more than twelve hundred students, and average school size is over six hundred. Similar changes have happened in several other branches of American life. These changes, Schaller contends, mean that the rules have changed for everyone involved in organizational life. Very large churches\u2014megachurches\u2014will increasingly come to embody the new rule-book for congregations. Extending their mission far beyond a single local neighborhood, they will draw large numbers of visitors, helping them move progressively from skeptics or seekers to believers to learners to disciples to apostles. The Very Large Church was written for those congregational leaders, both volunteer and paid staff, who recognize that their old rule-book is obsolete and who are eager to learn how to participate effectively in the very large church in a context that is defined by the culture, the societal context, clearly defined expectations, a theological belief system, a passion for evangelism, a high level of competence, creativity, innovation, and a new and different set of rules, rather than by local traditions, geographical boundaries, or yesterday\u2019s stereotypes. Key Features: \u2022 Focuses on issues in organization life\u2014Schaller\u2019s strong suit \u2022 Addresses a tendency that is growing today Key Benefits: \u2022 Places the shift to large churches within the context of a cultural shift from small to large institutions \u2022 Demonstrates how and why the old rule-book for organizational structure must change \u2022 Helps church leaders understand how to make the transition to the megachurch culture while retaining Christian integrity",

The martini was and still is more than just a cocktail. Originally mixed in the nineteenth century, it became an American icon in the twentieth, and the favorite drink of such luminaries as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Jack London, and Ernest Hemingway. Bernard De Voto called the martini \"the supreme American gift to world culture,\" while H. L. Mencken declared it \"the only American invention as perfect as a sonnet.\"The first book of its kind to explore the drink's wide appeal, this volume serves up a fabulous cocktail of martini-inspired art, cartoons, collectibles, advertisements, and film stills that reveal how deeply this classic has permeated every aspect of American culture, from literature and film to politics and high society. Complete with bartending lore, traditional martini recipes, literary excerpts, memorable scenes from James Bond movies, and more,The Martini offers a toast to this intoxicating symbol of the American dream.",

She knows which child will inherit Sarah's madness, and she'll pay any price to protect her siblings from this information.With insight and compassion, Ann Rinaldi explores the possibility that Patrick Henry's immortal cry of \"Give me liberty, or give me death,\" which roused a nation to arms, was first spoken by his wife, Sarah, as she pleaded to be released from her confinement.

Why does winning compel people to tear down goal posts, and losing, to drown themselves in bad keg beer? In short, why do fans care?In search of answers, Warren St. John seeks out the roving community of RVers who follow the Alabama Crimson Tide from game to game. A movable feast of Weber grills and Igloo coolers, these are hard-core football fans who arrive on Wednesday for Saturday\u2019s game: The Reeses, who skipped their own daughter\u2019s wedding because it coincided with a Bama game; Ray Pradat, the Episcopal minister who watches the games on a television beside his altar while performing weddings; and John Ed, the wheeling and dealing ticket scalper whose access to good seats gives him power on par with the governor. In no time at all, St. John buys an RV (a $5,500 beater named The Hawg) and joins the caravan for a full football season, chronicling the world of the extreme fan and learning that in the shadow of the stadium, it can all begin to seem strangely normal.  Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer is not only a hilarious travel story, but a cultural anthropology of fans that goes a long way toward demystifying the universal urge to take sides and to win.",

        "Description": "From backstage squabbles and box-office chicanery to the gallantry and glory of creation, this book unveils a delightful panorama of opera lore, alternately hilarious, poignant, and wise. Ethan Mordden has mined the literature for \"the best stories\" and retells them in the fresh and witty style that prompted Publishers Weekly to hail him as \"one of the most entertaining and provocative writers around.\"Mordden has selected a vast collection of classic, arcane and unusual anecdotes, including Giuseppe Verdi's advice on how to run an opera house and how to write an aria, Enrico Caruso's adventures in the San Francisco earthquake, Arturo Toscanini's reunion dinner with his former lover Geraldine Farrar, and Beverly Sills' ad libbing from the Met balcony during a Lily PonsLakm\u00e9. The volume contains sad stories, too, as when Hans von B\u00fclow confronts his wife Cosima after she has left him for Wagner; and silly stories, as when Colonel Henry Mapleson attempts to put onIl Trovatore while missing one of the four principals, Azucena. We see history being made when Gluck's \"psychological\" orchestration so startles the Paris Op\u00e9ra orchestra that the players trail off in astonishment; and we see history nearly unmade when Luciano Pavarotti's plane crashes en route to Milan.\"There is history here,\" Mordden notes, \"for if many of the tales are silly, many others are telling. They bring us close to a moment in which art is invented, revised, elaborated. The characters of opera's adventures are so vital and stimulating that almost anything they do enlightens us.\"",

Ronald Weinland states that 2008 will mark the beginning of the final events that will thrust the world into the great tribulation, which will usher in World War III. This last war will be the result of clashing religions and the governments they sway. This latest book explains end-time prophecies and the reasons such destructive events must come to pass. It also tells of God's intervention to save mankind from his self-imposed destruction, the end of man's self-rule, and the beginning of God's government being established over all nations. 2008-God's Final Witness is a revelation of the Book of Revelation. Ronald Weinland states that he has been given the task of revealing the truth about those things John wrote. This book also reveals the Seven Thunders of the Book of Revelation, which the apostle John was not allowed to record.",

It\u2019s celebrated in upscale bakeries, on Sex in the City, on the cover of Gourmet, and in thou-sands of classrooms\u2014where every day, it seems, a parent has sent in a batch for the kids to share. The very word conjures up whimsy, coziness, pleasure, nostalgia. Not to mention the fact that their diminutive size means you can eat a lot of them.  Once upon a time, a family had only two recipes for cupcakes\u2014chocolate and vanilla. Not anymore. Now Anne Byrn brings them to the next level. And who better? Recognized as the master of cake-mix baking, Anne is the author of The Cake Mix Doctor and Chocolate from the Cake Mix Doctor, which have a total of over 1.8 million copies in print. In Cupcakes she offers 135 tempting recipes for children and grown-ups, for special days and everyday, lunch bags, holiday festivities, and an unexpected dinner party dessert. You\u2019ll never believe these artful little cakes started with a mix. Coconut Snowballs, Jelly Doughnut Cupcakes, Kiss Me Cakes, Warm Chocolate Cupcakes with Molten Centers, Red Velvet Cupcakes with White Chocolate Peppermint Cream Cheese Frosting. There are surprising additions (tuck a chocolate kiss orpiece of cookie dough into the batter). Creative toppings and easy from-scratch frostings (whipped cream spiked with Kahlua; miniature M&ms; a creamy malted frosting with crushed malted milk balls).Terrific decorating ideas, from glittering golden dragees or elegant chocolate curls to yellow peeps for an Easter cupcake or\u2014for Groundhog\u2019s Day\u2014a groundhog\u2019s face made out of chocolate frosting and jimmies.

        "Description": "Can we find a life filled with passion, without being overwhelmed by it?\u00a0In this groundbreaking book,\u00a0John\u00a0Eldredge invites readers to acknowledge the significance of desire, abandon resignation, and embark on an adventure he calls \u201cour heart\u2019s most important journey.\u201d\u00a0Eldredge writes, \u201cThere is a secret set within each of our hearts. It is the desire for life as it was meant to be.\u201d Yet how do we uncover our desires and learn to decipher them? As Eldredge says, \u201cWe all share the same dilemma\u2014we long for life and we\u2019re not sure where to find it. We wonder if we ever do find it, can we make it last? . . . We must journey to find the life we prize. And the guide we have been given is the desire set deep within, the desire we often overlook or mistake for something else or even choose to ignore. The greatest human tragedy is to give up the search.\u201d\u00a0Many good people have been told that the path to a holy life requires us to kill our hearts\u2019 desires. And call it sanctification.\u00a0But in this re-release of one of Eldredge\u2019s most inspiring works, we discover that God is the author of our deepest desires. He has given us desire, and he loves to fulfill our hearts\u2019 desires. For as the Psalms declare, \u201cDelight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart\u201d (37:4).\u00a0God is calling to you through the desires of your heart.\u00a0How you respond will set the course for the rest of your life.\u00a0\u201c[Desire] is a profound and winsome call to walk into the heart of God and hear Him sing to your soul about His love. In a world of frenzy and clamor about desire, we often miss the ache that lifts our face to look into His eyes. This book will stir your heart and invite you to know the one desire that captures all passion for His purpose. Drink in this work, and your life will not be the same.\u201dDan Allender, Author, The Healing Path",

Following the survival of certain unexpected Templar traditions, the authors document the evolution of  a world-changing order through the birth of the Masonic lodge.  They chart the history of Freemasonry through its medieval roots  and into the modern era. The book posits that the order\u2019s contribution to the fostering  of tolerance, progressive values, and cohesion in English society  aided in preempting a French-style revolution in England; that  Freemasonry was an essential keystone in the formation of the  United States; and that America itself is an embodiment of the  ideal ?Masonic Republic.\u201d This groundbreaking thread of analysis  challenges the accepted traditions of Western history as it is currently taught. What is the true source of our most valued traditions? Twenty years since its original publication, The Temple and the  Lodge remains a trenchant and essential edition to any collection  of Western history.",

She begins her memorable search for independence with appealing enthusiasm, and the moment she steps into the Arcade bookstore, she knows she has found a home. The gruff owner, Mr. Pike, gives her a job sorting through huge piles of books and helping the rest of the staff\u2014a group as odd and idiosyncratic as the characters in a Dickens novel. There\u2019s Pearl, the loving, motherly transsexual who runs the cash register; Oscar, who organizes the nonfiction section and shares his extensive, eclectic knowledge with Rosemary, but furiously rejects her attempts at a more personal relationship; and Arthur Pick, who supervises the art section and demonstrates a particular interest in photography books featuring naked men.The store manager, Walter Geist, is an albino, a lonely figure even within the world of the Arcade. When Walter\u2019s eyesight begins to fail, Rosemary becomes his assistant. And so it is Rosemary who first reads the letter from someone seeking to \u201cplace\u201d a lost manuscript by Herman Melville. Mentioned in Melville\u2019s personal correspondence but never published, the work is of inestimable value, and proof of its existence brings the simmering ambitions and rivalries of the Arcade staff to a boiling point.Including actual correspondence by Melville, The Secret of Lost Things is at once a literary adventure that captures the excitement of discovering a long-lost manuscript by a towering American writer and an evocative portrait of life in a surprisingly colorful bookstore.",

        "Description": "Based on the vastly popular Fifth Edition of The Oxford Companion to English Literature edited by Margaret Drabble, this indispensable volume offers over five thousand alphabetically arranged entries on individual novels, plays, songs, poems, novelists, poets, playwrights, essayists, philosophers, historians, fictional characters, literary movements, legends, and much more.      Like its parent volume, this abridgement features useful plot summaries, separate entries on important fictional characters, and countless biographical articles on authors and other influential figures in the world of letters, all presented with the same lightness of touch that has made the original work such a pleasure to read.  It covers topics once regarded as non-literary--detective stories, science fiction, children's stories, and comic strips among them--as well as important movements and critical theories, including the latest developments in Freudian and Marxist criticism.       For this abridgement, the editors have eliminated the most peripheral entries from the parent volume and have condensed many of the remaining articles, while retaining the clear and graceful style that characterized the original.  They have also updated information on modern authors and works and have added several entirely new essays on a number of topics such as parody, anachronism, autobiography, heroic drama, and foreign influences on English literature.",
