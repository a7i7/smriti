Levin in his explosive book, Men in Black. 'But today, our out-of-control Supreme Court imperiously strikes down laws and imposes new ones to suit its own liberal whims''robbing us of our basic freedoms and the values on which our country was founded.'  In Men in Black: How the Supreme Court Is Destroying America, Levin exposes countless examples of outrageous Supreme Court abuses, from promoting racism in college admissions, expelling God and religion from the public square, forcing states to confer benefits on illegal aliens, and endorsing economic socialism to upholding partial-birth abortion, restraining political speech, and anointing terrorists with rights.\u00a0  Levin writes: 'Barely one hundred justices have served on the United States Supreme Court. They're unelected, they're virtually unaccountable, they're largely unknown to most Americans, and they serve for life'in many ways the justices are more powerful than members of Congress and the president.' As few as five justices can and do dictate economic, cultural, criminal, and security policy for the entire nation.'  In Men in Black, you will learn:  How the Supreme Court protects virtual child pornography and flag burning as forms of free speech but denies teenagers the right to hear an invocation mentioning God at a high school graduation ceremony because it might be 'coercive.' How a former Klansman and virulently anti-Catholic Supreme Court justice inserted the words 'wall of separation' between church and state in a 1947 Supreme Court decision''a phrase repeated today by those who claim to stand for civil liberty. How Justice Harry Blackmun, a one-time conservative appointee and the author of Roe v. Wade, was influenced by fan mail much like an entertainer or politician, which helped him to evolve into an ardent activist for gay rights and against the death penalty. How the Supreme Court has dictated that illegal aliens have a constitutional right to attend public schools, and that other immigrants qualify for welfare benefits, tuition assistance, and even civil service jobs.",

        "Description": "At a time when America debates its values and the world braces for religious war, Bruce Feiler, author of the New York Times bestsellers Walking the Bible and Abraham, travels ten thousand miles through the Middle East to examine the questionIs Religion Tearing Us Apart ... Or Can it Bring Us Together?Where God Was Born combines the adventure of a wartime chronicle and an archaeological detective story with an inspiring journey of spiritual exploration. Taking readers to biblical sites not seen by Westerners for decades, it uncovers little-known details about the common roots of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and affirms the importance of the Bible in today's world. Where God Was Born observes that at the birth moment of the biblical religions, all of the faiths took from one another, exchanged ideas, recognized their commonalities, and were open to peaceful coexistence. Offering a rare vision of God that can unite different faiths into a shared allegiance of hope, this is a brave, challenging, and profound work that addresses the most important issues of our time.Enhanced CD: Put this CD in your computer to view photographs from Walking the Bible: A Photographic Journey",

In Adapt or Die, the experts from SAP provide a thought-provoking road map to a new business world in which companies are linked together by uniform business processes and standardized software (uniform business processes and standardized software leaves me the impression of being rigid and inflexible, which is contrary to what were trying to say in the book). An adaptive business network allows companies to more precisely control inventory, quickly add or drop trading partners, and produce products and services that mirror actual customer demand.Adapt or Die explores all the vital aspects of the adaptive business network, including:The benefits for your businessWays to prepare your companyImplementing the adaptive business network in four stepsIts application to specific industriesThe changes the adaptive business network will bring to the future of business",

Does your child suffer from any of the following?\u2022 Allergic Nose Rub \u2022 Eye Circles \u2022 Red Ears \u2022 Red Cheeks \u2022 Eye Wrinkles \u2022 Aggression \u2022 Lack of Alertness \u2022 Mottled Tongue \u2022 In this breakthrough book, Dr. Doris Rapp offers a simple yet effective approach to handling \"problem\" children. Is This Your Child? shows parents how to identify the common foods, chemicals, or common allergic substances that could be the culprits that cause some children or adults to feel unwell or act inappropriately. If your child is always sick, hyperactive, a slow learner, or cranky, the first question you should ask is not \"What drug should be prescribed?\" or \"What have I done wrong as a parent?\" Instead, find out the cause. Dr. Rapp gives sensible suggestions about how these reactions to foods and environmental factors can be recognized, prevented, and treated. With this information, many affected children should feel, act, behave, and learn better. If you can detect unsuspected environmental illness in your child--or yourself--you can change your lives so you're more content, happy, and free of illness.",

        "Description": "\"I'm always reminding people that the one constant you can count on is that things happen--and usually when you're not in the mood for them.\"It's now a proven medical fact that good humor reduces the negative effects of stress. Over the course of twenty years, millions of people have learned this lesson while being entertained and enlightened by Loretta LaRoche in one of her enormously popular series of lectures given in public seminars; in corporate environments for clients like IBM, Reebok, Fidel-ity Investments, and Blue Cross, Blue Shield; and most recently in nationwide broadcasts on public television. Now she puts her sensible, sensational philosophy on paper--and gives readers the tools they need to laugh themselves to less stress and better health.\"One night I greeted Bob at the door wearing nothing but his wing-tipped shoes. I was laughing hysterically about how I looked. Bob didn't crack a smile. Instead, he bellowed, 'What are the neighbors going to think?'\" 'I don't know,' I replied, 'I haven't shown them yet.' \"Loretta LaRoche has been called \"the Erma Bombeck of stress reduction\"--and in the helpful and hilarious pages of this book, her enormous talent for finding the funny detail to defuse even the most difficult situation has never been sharper.\"Buy something silly and wear it. A Groucho Marx nose, mustache, and glasses are my favorite. When the stress seems unbearable, when you've really reached the limits of your endurance, go into a bathroom, look into the mirror, put on your glasses, and ask yourself, 'How serious is this?' \"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relax--You May Only Have a Few Minutes Left is filled with practical exercises, hilarious anecdotes, and specific advice for coming to terms with today's ever-increasing stress levels--it is a remedy for anxiety and a prescription for laughter.\"Most of us don't realize what an impact we have on the world around us. A positive energy field is going to affect others in a beneficial way, even if you don't notice it at first. Why not ask for a standing ovation once in a while? When you go in to work, say, 'I came in--it wasn't easy. I could have gone somewhere else. I'd like a standing ovation.' \"In sections like \"If You Don't Have to Suffer--Don't Practice,\" \"My Mother the CEO,\" and \"I'm Not Afraid of Heights, Just Widths,\" LaRoche dismantles our American predilection for taking ourselves too seriously and shows us how to live longer, happier lives using the healing power of the absurd.",

They have a treat in store. In\u00a0\u00a0clear and beautiful prose Jerry tells us that peace\u00a0\u00a0is a conscious choice. Saying good-bye to guilt is\u00a0\u00a0a vital step in making that choice.\"--from\u00a0\u00a0the Foreword by John Denver. Love is\u00a0\u00a0where there is no fear. Fear is where there is no love.\u00a0\u00a0In our age of anxieties, most of us live by\u00a0\u00a0complex expectations about what we should achieve, how\u00a0\u00a0we should act, and how others should treat us. As\u00a0\u00a0a result, we are victimized by guilt and\u00a0\u00a0fear--guilt because our standards haven't been met in the\u00a0\u00a0past, fear that they won't be met in the future.\u00a0\u00a0Inevitable, these negative emotions wreak havoc\u00a0\u00a0on our personal relationships, self -esteem, and\u00a0\u00a0peace of mind. But what if we let go of our fear\u00a0\u00a0and guilt? The transformation can be miraculous,\u00a0\u00a0says world famous psychiatrist and author Gerald\u00a0\u00a0G. Jampolsky. The secret lies in healthy\u00a0\u00a0perception of yourself. Dr. Jampolsky points the way\u00a0\u00a0through fourteen lessons that can change your life.\u00a0\u00a0These lessons show: How to quiet the ego-self that\u00a0\u00a0creates fear and guilt. How to accept genuine\u00a0\u00a0love and give it away. How to stop judging others,\u00a0\u00a0thereby to stop judging yourself. How to listen to\u00a0\u00a0your inner voice to receive support and guidance.\u00a0\u00a0How to forgive others so that loneliness and\u00a0\u00a0separation become illusions of the past. And much\u00a0\u00a0more. Here is a book for everyone who seeks the key\u00a0\u00a0to life's most satisfying reward. A book that\u00a0\u00a0tells you how to throw off the burdens of the past,\u00a0\u00a0and learn what it can mean to truly love.",

        "Title": "The New Face of War: How War Will Be Fought in the 21st Century",
        "Authors": "By Berkowitz, Bruce D.",
        "Description": "As American and coalition troops fight the first battles of this new century -- from Afghanistan to Yemen to the Philippines to Iraq -- they do so in ways never before seen. Until recently, information war was but one piece of a puzzle, more than a sideshow in war but far less than the sum total of the game. Today, however, we find information war revolutionizing combat, from top to bottom. Gone are the advantages of fortified positions -- nothing is impregnable any longer. Gone is the reason to create an overwhelming mass of troops -- now, troop concentrations merely present easier targets. Instead, stealth, swarming, and \"zapping\" (precision strikes on individuals or equipment) are the order of the day, based on superior information and lightning-fast decision-making. In many ways, modern warfare is information warfare.  Bruce Berkowitz's explanation of how information war revolutionized combat and what it means for our soldiers could not be better timed. As Western forces wage war against terrorists and their supporters, in actions large and small, on several continents, The New Face of War explains how they fight and how they will win or lose. There are four key dynamics to the new warfare: asymmetric threats, in which even the strongest armies may suffer from at least one Achilles' heel; information-technology competition, in which advantages in computers and communications are crucial; the race of decision cycles, in which the first opponent to process and react to information effectively is almost certain to win; and network organization, in which fluid arrays of combat forces can spontaneously organize in multiple ways to fight any given opponent at any time.  America's use of networked, elite ground forces, in combination with precision-guided bombing from manned and unmanned flyers, turned Afghanistan from a Soviet graveyard into a lopsided field of American victory. Yet we are not invulnerable, and the same technology that we used in Kuwait in 1991 is now available to anyone with a credit card and access to the Internet. Al Qaeda is adept in the new model of war, and has searched long and hard for weaknesses in our defenses. Will we be able to stay ahead of its thinking? In Iraq, Saddam's army is in no position to defeat its enemies -- but could it defend Baghdad? As the world anxiously considers these and other questions of modern war, Bruce Berkowitz offers many answers and a framework for understanding combat that will never again resemble the days of massive marches on fortress-like positions.  The New Face of War is a crucial guidebook for reading the headlines from across our troubled planet.",

In examining the Christian themes in the trilogy, authors Kurt Bruner and Jim Ware find that truth and fiction are not as far apart as they seem. And that although Tolkien never intended for these books to present the gospel, when read in the light of Scripture they offer a rich tapestry of redemption, values, and faith against all odds from which we may learn much.",

        "Title": "Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue",
        "Authors": "By Woodruff, Paul",
        "Description": "Reverence is an ancient virtue dating back thousands of years. It survives among us in half-forgotten patterns of behavior and in the vestiges of old ceremonies. Yet, Paul Woodruff says, we have lost sight of reverence. This short, elegiac volume makes an impassioned case for the fundamental importance of the forgotten virtue of reverence, and how awe for things greater than oneself can--indeed must--be a touchstone for other virtues like respect, humility, and charity.     Ranging widely over diverse cultural terrain--from Philip Larkin to ancient Greek poetry, from modern politics to Chinese philosophy--Woodruff shows how absolutely essential reverence is to a well-functioning society. He tackles some thorny questions: How does reverence allow not only for leaders but for followers?  What role does reverence play in religion?  Do some religions misuse reverence? Must reverence be humorless? In the process, Woodruff shows convincingly how reverence plays an unseen part in virtually every human relationship.Elegantly written, thoughtful yet urgent, Reverence is sure to reach out to a wide variety of people interested in the moral health of Western culture, showing how our own intellectual and spiritual legacy can guide us more than we realize.",
