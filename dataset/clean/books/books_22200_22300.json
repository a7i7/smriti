        "Description": "George and Nina seem like the perfect couple. They share a cozy, cluttered Brooklyn apartment, a taste for impromptu tuna casserole dinners, and a devotion to ballroom dancing lessons at Arthur Murray. They love each other. There's only one hitch: George is gay. And when Nina announces she's pregnant, things get especially complicated. Howard -- Nina's overbearing boyfriend and the baby's father -- wants marriage. Nina wants independence. George will do anything for a little unqualified affection, but is he ready to become an unwed surrogate dad? A touching and hilarious novel about love, friendship, and the many ways of making a family.",

Why do people always inappropriately compare themselves to Rosa Parks? Why is a bad life in sunny California so much worse than a bad life anywhere else? What is it about the Zen of foul shots? And, in the title piece, why must doubt and internal arguments haunt the sleepless nights of the true patriot? Her essays confront a wide range of subjects, themes, icons, and historical moments: Ike, Teddy Roosevelt, and Bill Clinton; Canadian Mounties and German filmmakers; Tom Cruise and Buffy the Vampire Slayer; twins and nerds; the Gettysburg Address, the State of the Union, and George W. Bush's inauguration.  The result is a teeming and engrossing book, capturing Vowell's memorable wit and her keen social commentary.",

        "Title": "Fair of Speech: The Uses of Euphemism",
        "Authors": "By Enright, D. J. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Can a bomb ever be \"clean\"?  Are we relieved to be warned that there will be an \"odor\" when once we were told that something would \"stink\"?  Or, to put it another way, when is a euphemism a mark of good taste and when is it a sign of verbal obfuscation?      To answer such questions, D.J. Enright invited sixteen distinguished writers to ponder and explore the ubiquitous phenomenon of euphemism.  The result is a delightful and provocative collection that not only includes general reflections on euphemism and its history but also treats such specific categories as sex, death, and other natural functions; politics; the language of the great Christian texts; euphamisms spoken to and by children; the law; medicine; office life; and the jargon of official spokesmen, military communiques, and tyrants.  Such writers as Diane Johnson, Robert Nisbet, John Gross, Robert Burchfield, and Joseph Epstein bring a variety of perspectives and sensibilities to bear on these topics. Because euphemisms are so intimate and integral to our thinking, any study of them is bound to throw light on the human condition, both past and present.  In these essays, humor jostles horror and the homely alternates with the farfetched.  Taken together they form an eloquent and often amusing testament to the richness of the subject. About the Author: D.J. Enright is a noted English poet and critic.  He recently compiled and edited The Oxford Book of Death.",

From their first encounters with cryptic rental listings to their back-to-Europe yard sale twelve months later, Beppe explores this foreign land with the self-described patience of a mildly inappropriate beachcomber, holding up a mirror to America\u2019s signature manners and mores.  Succumbing to his surroundings day by day, he and his wife find themselves developing a taste for Klondike bars and Samuel Adams beer, and even that most peculiar of American institutions -- the pancake house.The realtor who waves a perfect bye-bye, the overzealous mattress salesman who bounces from bed to bed, and the plumber named Marx who deals in illegally powerful showerheads are just a few of the better-than-fiction characters the Severgninis encounter while foraging for clues to the real America. A trip to the computer store proves just as revealing as D.C.\u2019s Fourth of July celebration, as do boisterous waiters angling for tips and no-parking signs crammed with a dozen lines of fine print. By the end of his visit, Severgnini has come to grips with life in these United States -- and written a charming, laugh-out-loud tribute.",

Two are married. One despairs of ever finding love. Three women. Leading their busy adult lives. Yet first and always: friends.Then something unexpected happens that forever alters their long, complicated friendship. A pivotal event, a shattering act of betrayal shifts the balance of power between husbands and wives, parents and children, sisters and brothers. And in the months that follow, each of them will look at their families, their lives \u2014 and one another \u2014 differently. And Cecile, Norma, and Amanda will never be the same.Filled with the powerful storytelling and emotional resonance that are Belva Plain's trademarks, Looking Back weaves magic as it captures the profound intimacy and drama in the lives of men and women.

And when the final curtain is at last raised on this paranormal drama -- the hunter finds himself the hunted.",

When Melanie Sartomsky, wily Floridian flight attendant, snares billionaire divorc\u00e9e Arthur \u201cthe coffin king\u201d Korn, she is catapulted into the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Park Avenue society, where hiring the wrong decorator is tantamount to social suicide, and where, if you\u2019re anyone, your personal assistant has a personal assistant. But Melanie quickly discovers that in the world of the rich and idle, malicious gossip is as de rigeur as owning twenty pairs of Manolo Blahniks. And despite her frenzied plunge into the charity circuit and the right dinner reservations, her neighbors are Givenchy-clad vultures who see her as nothing more than a reinvented trailer trollop. To make matters worse, when a snide society-rag journalist rakes her over the coals, Melanie\u2019s reputation is toast. Meanwhile, Melanie is not the only billionaire in the neighborhood coming unhinged. Kleptomania, adultery, plagiarism, and a grisly Harlem sex murder are just a few of the secrets swirling under the pedigreed patina of furs and emeralds on Park Avenue. Authors Jill Kargman and Carrie Karasyov know a thing or two about their subject matter. They met at the Upper East Side\u2019s chic Spence School and claim that The Right Address is inspired by \u201cthe insane socialites we\u2019ve eavesdropped on our entire lives.\u201d Meow. So kick off your Jimmy Choos, crack open the Veuve Clicquot, and get ready for a rollicking, unforgettable tour of the richer-and-bitchier-than-thou set.",

He is best known not just for being funny, but for advocating truth over sensitivity and taking on the political establishment.Maher first came to national attention as the host of the hit ABC-TV program Politically Incorrect, where he offered a combustible mixture of irreverence and acerbic humor that helped him to garner a loyal following, as well as a reputation for being a controversial bad boy. Bill Maher's popular new HBO television show, Real Time, has put Maher more front and center than ever before. Partic-ularly one regular segment on the show, entitled \"New Rules,\" has been a hit with his ever-growing legion of fans. It is the part of the show during which Maher takes serious aim, bringing all of his intelligence, incisiveness, wit, and his signature exasperation to bear on topics ranging from cell phones (\"I don't need my cell phone to take pictures or access the Internet. I just need it to make a phone call. From everywhere! Not just the places it likes!\") to fast food (\"No McDonald's in hospitals. I'm not kidding!) to the conservative agenda (\"Stop claiming it's an agenda. It's not an agenda. It's a random collection of laws that your corporate donors paid you to pass.\")His new book, the first since his bestselling When You Ride ALONE You Ride with bin Laden, brings these brilliantly conceived riffs and rants to the written page. Appropriately titled New Rules, the book will collect some of the best of the rules derived from previously written material and will also contain substantial new material, including some longer form \"editorials\"--of course with a twist and bite that only Bill Maher can deliver.",

Henry, ever resourceful, a pearl gray fedora parked on his head, has a sandwich board and a hidden stash of hooch for the speakeasies of the Lower East Side. When he starts hiring kids to carry boards for him, he catches the attention of the mobsters who run the distrist. It is time to leave, for another, newer America.In Chicago there is no past waiting to jump on Henry. Music is everywhere, in the streets, in nightclubs, on phonograph records: furious, wild, happy music played by a man with a trumpet and bleeding lips called Louis Armstrong. But Armstrong is a prisoner of his color, and the mob is in Chicago too: they own every stage - and they own the man up on the stage. Armstrong needs a man, a white man, and the man he chooses is Henry Smart.",

His canvas is huge: it is business, and all of life.A sailboat ride on Lake Superior becomes a talk on how to manage by using the \"enormous wind [that] has been blowing since the beginning of humankind. It is that force that insists we improve as a race....\"Time spent sitting on the ground becomes a call to managers to have \"their own sacred plot of dirt. One they could sit on regularly, getting grass stains on their shorts, stray ants on their backs, and a little bark from the tree in their hair. A spot where, if they sit for an hour or two, they can remember who they are, and see the world for what it is.\"Buying a boat that is two feet shorter than his previous boat becomes a dialogue on the need to pay only for what we really want, rather than what we think we want.Watching his son's hockey game becomes a chautauqua on the joyful challenges of playing the game of work, from scoring goals to being bounced on the ice by a worthy opponent.With gentle assurance and honest insight, Small Decencies reminds us that we can be true to our values both at home and at work, and that the more humanely we treat one another, the better we will be as people, and the better we will be in doing our life's work.",

Swaggering, strutting, sometimes sinister, always fascinating, Mick Jagger boasts a career spanning four decades - from the turbulent sixties and sybaritic seventies through the booming eighties to the cautious nineties.His is the story of a generation. With Elvis Presley and John Lennon gone, he is arguably the last of the rock titans. Yet Jagger, jealously guarding the secrets of his life, has always managed to remain the most enigmatic of icons.As Jagger celebrates his fiftieth birthday in 1993, best-selling author Christopher Andersen strips the mask from Jumpin' Jack Flash in a no-holds-barred biography as shocking and uncompromising as Jagger himself.The riveting portrait that emerges is based on years of research and countless interviews with friends, teachers, fellow musicians, family members, neighbors, industry insiders, and lovers. Among the many startling insights and revelations in Jagger Unauthorized:Jagger's bisexual history - and the full story of his bizarre relationships with David Bowie, Rudolf Nureyev, Andy Warhol, and one of today's biggest male rock superstars;Never-before-revealed details of his turbulent marriages to Bianca Jagger and Jerry Hall, his affairs with Marianne Faithfull, Carly Simon, and Linda Ronstadt, and his sexual escapades with numberless fans - including Madonna;The years awash in cocaine, hashish, LSD, and speed - the headline-making drug trials, and how long this harrowing substance abuse really went on;A rare behind-the-scenes glimpse of Jagger's business dealings, and why he is rightly considered a financial genius;And of course, all the scandal, drama, and genius that went into making the Rolling Stones the \"world's greatest rock and roll band\": the backstage maneuverings to oust Stones cofounder Brian Jones and Jones's mysterious early death, Jagger's strangely erotic love-hate affair with Keith Richards that continues today, the bloodbath at Altamont, the countless hits and record-smashing tours, the Steel Wheels triumph, and much more.Jagger Unauthorized is, like its subject, explosive and compelling - the definitive biography of a man whose very name defines an era.",

        "Description": "Why should employers pay American workers much more to work far fewer hours a year than the competition? They won\u2019t\u2014unless Americans know more and can do more than the workers with whom they compete. Thinking for a Living is the first book to address head-on the issue of the appalling mismatch between what our economy needs and what our educational institutions actually provide. A massive imbalance between the resources available for the education of our managerial, technical, and professional workers on the one hand, and our line workers on the other, threatens our economic survival, according to Marshall and Tucker. The book provides a blueprint for the radical reconstruction of our schools, following much the same principles that allowed some of America\u2019s leading industrial organizations to rescue themselves from the brink of ruin by greatly raising productivity without increasing costs. But education, the authors point out, is far more than schooling. All the major functions of our society must function as integrated learning systems. This book spells out how families, communities, and, most of all, businesses can contribute to the effectiveness of our most valuable resource: people. The American educational system is designed to meet the manpower needs of a bygone era. If America is to survive in the infinitely more demanding economic environment of the next century, we must maximize the skills of our work force. Our economic policies will fail\u2014and our standard of living will fall\u2014unless they are linked to an aggressive education policy that results in unprecedented levels of performance.",

        "Description": "A fifteen-year-old boy is walking through a swirling fog on his way to school when a voice calls out, \"Come here. We need to talk.\" Out of the mist emerges an old man with a white beard. He is a fantastic figure, as wizardly as Merlin, as wise as Socrates, as peaceful as Buddha. Whoever he is, the old man has appeared on that very day to change the boy's life.  \"You are old enough to learn about things,\" he says mysteriously. \"And who is going to teach you but me?\"  The old man gives the boy four days of \"soul training,\" a time of riddles, tricks, parables, and fantastic twists that bring out surprising answers to each of four burning questions about spirituality:  Do I have a soul? How do wishes come true? What is the supreme force in the universe? How can I change the world?  The boy was Deepak Chopra, who grew up to become an acclaimed writer and teacher about the same invisible things that the old man had taught him. Fire in the Heart is Dr. Chopra's first book for young adults. Its aim is to pass on this soul training to young readers.  \"The old man with the white beard showed me the spiritual side of life,\" writes the author, \"where real passion and excitement come from. So before you begin, take a deep breath. This story could turn out to be yours.\"  \"[Spirit is] everywhere, making sure that everything is connected. The light from a star billions of light years away is the same light that makes plants grow here on earth. The plants give food; the food has allowed you to develop in your mother's womb; and today you look at that star with the eyes that the stars gave you. There's the cosmic connection.\"  -- from Fire in the Heart",
