But the book may never be published in his native Japan: each translator who takes up the ninety-eighth story chooses death too -- including Kazami Kano's boyfriend, Shoji. Haunted by Shoji's death, Kazami is inexorably drawn to three young people whose lives are intimately bound to the late writer and his work. Over the course of an astonishing summer, she will discover the truth behind the ninety-eighth story -- and she will come to believe that \"everytking that had happened was shockingly beautiful enough to make you crazy.",

        "Title": "Bunts: Curt Flood Camden Yards Pete Rose and Other Reflections on Baseball",
        "Authors": "By Will, George F.",
        "Description": "At the beginning of the 1990s, a political columnist and Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator set out, in his words, to write an antiromantic book about a subject that had been romanticized in print for one hundred years. The subject was baseball, the columnist George Will, and the book Men at Work. His antiromantic love letter was warmly received by those who love baseball. Critics called it \"an excellent book about excellence\" (Barbara Grizzuti Harrison), \"a classic [that] may even stand up as the best baseball book of the 1990s\" (Jerome Holtzman), \"a hit -- a triple off the center field wall\" (Roger Angell), and by readers who kept it at the top of bestseller lists for more than five months.  He's back.  George Will returns to baseball with more than seventy finely honed pieces about the sometimes recondite, sometimes frustrating, always passionately felt National Pastime. Here are Will's eulogy for the late Curt Flood (\"Dred Scott in Spikes\"), Will on Ted Williams (\"When Ted Williams retired in 1960, a sportswriter said that Boston knew how Britain felt when it lost India. Indeed. Britain felt diminished, but also a bit relieved\"), and on his own baseball career (\"I was a very late draft choice of the Mittendorf Funeral Home Panthers. Our color was black\"). Here are subjects ranging from the author's 1977 purchase of a single share of stock in the Chicago Cubs, a purchase brokered by Warren Buffett (\"a St. Louis Cardinal fan, but not otherwise sinister\"), to the collision between Pete Rose and Bart Giamatti, to the building of Camden Yards in Baltimore, to the dismantling of the 1997 World Series Champion Florida Martins.  With new material, including an essay on the art of baseball broadcasting, featuring ESPN play-by-play man Jon Miller, and incorporating more than seventy photos, Bunts is certain to be for 1998 what Men at Work was for 1990 -- \"inquisitive and extraordinarily nimble-minded ... this season's baseball book of choice\" (The Wall Street Journal).",

        "Title": "The CLINTON ENIGMA : A FOUR AND A HALF MINUTE SPEECH REVEALS THIS PRESIDENT'S ENTIRE LIFE",
        "Authors": "By Maraniss, David",
        "Description": "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Maraniss, regarded by his peers as the nation's leading expert on Bill Clinton, sat in a darkened television studio in New York on the night of August 17 and watched the president deliver his curious apologia confessing that he had misled the nation about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. As Maraniss, the author of First in His Class, the highly acclaimed Clinton biography, listened to the president's words that night, it struck him that he had heard them all before, though never in one speech, and that in those four and a half minutes Clinton had revealed all the contradictory qualities of his tumultuous life and political career.  In this insightful new book, drawing from the biography and his writings for The Washington Post, Maraniss dissects the speech as a revelation of the president's entire life. Alternately reckless and cautious, righteous and repentant, evasive and forgetful, relying on family and friends to protect him, affirming his faith in God and then turning to polls to tell him what the public would tolerate, communicating with the public over the heads of pundits and professionals, transforming his personal trauma into a political cause by attacking his and his wife's enemies, asking us all to put his troubles behind us, Clinton combined all his weaknesses and strengths in that one brief address.  In the first section of The Clinton Enigma, Maraniss reflects as a biographer on his curious but revealing dealings with Clinton over the years. Then, after Clinton has spoken, Maraniss dissects the words and interprets the deeper meaning paragraph by paragraph, to show the roots and echoes from the president's past and to explain why Clinton acts and speaks as he does. With Bill Clinton, Maraniss writes, past is always prologue.",

        "Title": "Where I'm Bound: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Ballard, Allen B.",
        "Description": "Where I'm Bound, a stunning and engaging Civil War novel, is the first work of fiction to focus solely on the soldiers of an African-American regiment. Throughout the war, more than 180,000 African-American men fought for the Union Army. Many were escaped slaves, others were freed men; yet all voluntarily enlisted for one cause: freedom. For the first time in fiction, their experiences are successfully portrayed in a manner befitting the grandeur and scope of their contributions. Inspired by the true story of a black cavalry unit in Mississippi, renowned African-American historian Allen Ballard weaves factual events with the fictional account of an escaped slave, Joe Duckett, who flees to join the Northern Army.  When Duckett escapes his life of bondage to become a cavalry scout, he grows to be more than a free man -- he becomes a hero. Duckett and his hard-riding regiment roam the Mississippi Delta, freeing slaves and keeping vital waterways open for the Union. As the war approaches its final, tragic days, Duckett embarks on his most dangerous mission yet: to return to the plantation from which he escaped in order to reunite with his wife and daughter.  More than just an account of the Civil War, Where I'm Bound is an affecting portrayal of the psychological effects of war. Through the character Duckett, some of war's greatest tragedies are painfully evoked -- the agonizing separation from family, the horrendous mission of having to kill another man, and the cruelty and moral corruption that occur when men's passions are their greatest weapons against one another. This story of one man's ability to meet such overwhelming challenges brings to life the noble fight for freedom as displayed by African-American soldiers as well as the effects of that fight on an entire country and culture.  Dr. Ballard's first work of fiction is a striking blend of historical fact and dramatic storytelling brilliantly illustrating the accomplishments of African-American Civil War soldiers. Where I'm Bound is destined to become a classic novel of the Civil War.",

        "Authors": "By Flanagan, David",
        "Description": "The bestselling Java in a Nutshell has been updated to cover Java 1.1.   If you're a Java programmer who is migrating to 1.1, this second  edition contains everything you need to get up to speed on the new features of Java 1.1.  Or if you are just now jumping on the Java bandwagon, Java in a Nutshell still has all of the features that have  made it the Java book most often recommended on the Internet.  An  advanced introduction to Java for C and C++ programmers teaches you  everything you need to know about the language, while the complete  quick-reference contains descriptions of all of the classes in the  Java 1.1 API, with the exception of the Enterprise APIs.Java in a Nutshell also fully describes the syntax of the Java language,  making it the only quick reference that a Java programmer needs.The second edition of Java in a Nutshell covers Version 1.1 of the Java  Development Kit (JDK).  It includes all of the material from the first  edition, as well as the following updated information for Java 1.1:A detailed overview of all of the features in Java 1.1, both on a package-by-package basis and in terms of overall functionality.A comprehensive tutorial on \"inner classes\" that explains how to use all of the new types of inner classes: static member classes, member classes, local classes, and anonymous classes.Practical, real-world example programs that demonstrate the  features in Java 1.1, including object serialization, the new AWT event handling model, internationalization, and a sample Java Bean.A complete quick reference for all of the classes, methods, and variables in the core Java 1.1 API.  The quick-reference pages include indicators that make it easy to find the 1.1 material. In addition, cross-reference material is now provided directly on each reference page.With the 1.1 release, Java has grown too large to fit in a single book, even in quick-reference form.  Thus, we see the need to splitJava in a Nutshell into multiple volumes.  This volume, the \"original\" Java in a Nutshell, documents the most commonly used features of Java and is an indispensable reference for all Java programmers.  We may publish a separate volume that will cover the Java \"Enterprise APIs\", which include the database connectivity, remote method invocation, and security features, as well as other forthcoming components, such as CORBA IDL support and the electronic commerce framework.  And as other new Java APIs are developed and released, we may consider adding new volumes to the Java in a Nutshell series.",

In this complete revision of his 1962 book -- over half of which is entirely new material -- he describes in detail for the first time how acupuncture works from a scientific point of view, explaining the neurophysiological mechanism involved as well as the basic principles and laws according to the theories of traditional Chinese medicine. Written for both the layman and the medical profession, the book illustrates its points with case histories drawn from Dr. Mann's own patients in England.",

Reengineering has become a part of everyone&#39;s business vocabulary. It is undoubtedly the business concept of the nineties.  In The Reengineering Revolution, Michael Hammer and Steven Stanton build on this foundation to share with readers their experiences in successfully implementing reengineering in companies around the world. In an easy-reading, anecdotal style, the book offers behind-the-scenes stories of reengineering successes and failures; practical techniques for key aspects of reengineering, from breaking long standing assumptions to managing change; and insights into the new ways of thinking that reengineering requires.  Just as Reengineering the Corporation shot to the top of the bestseller charts, so has The Reengineering Revolution. It is the practical guide for which business people have been waiting to help them achieve the dramatic improvements -- in speed, productivity, quality, service and profits -- that reengineering promises.",

And as the car continues to climb up and up this treacherously steep embankment on the high moors of Northumberland, Lori is beginning to doubt the wisdom of her latest adventure: perhaps the mind-numbing effect of caring for her twin toddlers wasn't so bad after all?Lori is on her way to Wyrdhurst Hall, having jumped at the opportunity offered to her by Stan Finderman, her old boss, to evaluate a rare book collection. The collection is housed in the grim neo-Gothic castle owned by newlyweds Nicole and Jared Hollander. The hall, the books, and the journey to this remote and misty corner of Northumberland are full of surprises - some pleasant and some not so. Meeting Adam Chase, a charming, handsome stranger, is definitely a pleasant one - although Lori suspects he knows more than he's telling about the hall's mysterious secrets.Lori falls under Wyrdhurst's spell - and Adam's - when she unearths a cache of World War I letters that tell a tale of doomed love and hint at a treasure hidden in the hall. It will take all of Dimity's supernatural skills to help Lori solve the puzzle and restore peace to a family haunted by its tragic past.",

        "Description": "Research now confirms that trans fats\u2014linked to heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer\u2014are worse for our bodies than saturated fats such as butter and lard. That's why, in the summer of 2003, the FDA ruled that food manufacturers must list trans fat amounts on nutrition labels. Unfortunately, the new ruling won't be enforced until 2006.In THE TRANS FAT SOLUTION, Kim Severson, James Beard Award\u2013winning food reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, demystifies the science of trans fat (commonly known as partially hydrogenated shortening or oil) and offers simple formulas for detecting it in packaged foods. Working with Seattle-based chef and food consultant Cindy Burke, Severson offers more than 60 quick and delicious recipes for trans fat\u2013free versions of your favorite foods, including Maple Crunch Granola, Bistro French Fries, Chicken-Tarragon Potpies, and, yes, even substitutes for high-fat offenders like piecrusts, waffles, and cookies.So next time you're tempted to open a box of crackers, a bag of microwave popcorn, or a package of ramen noodles, open THE TRANS FAT SOLUTION instead. Your health depends on it.The National Academy of Sciences recently declared that no level of trans fat is safe. It can clog arteries and leads to heart attacks, strokes, and other diseases.Trans fats are found in more than 40 percent of the processed food on super-market shelves\u2014cookies, crackers, cakes, cereals, toaster waffles, biscuits, piecrusts, and even microwave popcorn! Reviews\u201cTHE TRANS FAT SOLUTION belongs on every kitchen shelf. The information is most valuable and the recipes are simple and ideal for the home cook.\u201d \u2014Marion Cunningham, author of The Fannie Farmer Cookbook\u201cGreat information for the health-conscious consumer. Even I learned something reading the book. \u201d \u2014Joanne Ikeda, codirector, Center for Weight and Health, University of California, Berkeley\u201cIf you're like most people, your pantry is chock-full of foods containing trans fats\u2014cereals, microwave popcorn, cookies, crackers, baking mixes. . . .  So how do you go about eliminating this deadly fat from your diet?  The Trans Fat Solution by Kim Severson is a good place to start.\u201d \u2014Spirit magazine",

Now, Delaware\u2019s new adventure leads the sleuthing psychologist on a harrowing exploration into the realm he knows best: the human psyche, in all its complexity, mystery, and terrifying propensity for darkness.\u201cBeen a while since I had me a nice little whodunit,\u201d homicide detective Milo Sturgis tells Alex Delaware. But there\u2019s definitely nothing nice about the brutal tableau behind the yellow crime-scene tape. On a lonely lover\u2019s lane in the hills of Los Angeles, a young couple lies murdered in a car. Each bears a single gunshot wound to the head. The female victim has also been impaled by a metal spike. And that savage stroke of psychopathic fury tells Milo this case will call for more than standard police procedure. As he explains to Delaware, \u201cNow we\u2019re veering into your territory.\u201dIt is dark territory, indeed. The dead woman remains unidentified and seemingly unknown to everyone. But her companion has a name: Gavin Quick\u2014and his troubled past eventually landed him on a therapist\u2019s couch. It\u2019s there, on familiar turf, that Delaware hopes to find vital clues. And that means going head-to-head with Dr. Mary Lou Koppel, a popular celebrity psychologist who fiercely guards the privacy of her clients . . . dead or alive. But when there\u2019s another gruesomely familiar murder, Delaware surmises that his investigation has struck a nerve. As he trolls the twisted wreckage of Quick\u2019s tormented last days, what he finds isn\u2019t madness, but the cold-blooded method behind it. And as he follows a chain of greed, corruption, and betrayal snaking hideously through the profession he thought he knew, he\u2019ll discover territory where even he never dreamed of treading.As provocative as it is suspenseful, Therapy is premier Kellerman that finds the award-winning author firing on all creative cylinders\u2014and carrying readers on an electrifying ride to a place only he can take them, for an experience they won\u2019t soon forget.",

Two days later, he witnesses a bloody explosion at a gala opening at a SoHo art gallery.Unrelated incidents? Not to Terry Orr. A single father to a remarkable twelve-year-old daughter, Terry is still devoted to his beautiful Italian wife, a painter of immense talent, whose life ended abruptly during a brutal event that took the life also of their infant son. Sparked to action by violence and deception, Terry understands he can confront his demons by learning the skills of the PI trade and finding the madman who forever changed his life. And, perhaps, by finally realizing what it means to be the father of a young, loving daughter.But the person who killed cabdriver Aubrey Brown isn't easy to find, particularly for a troubled, headstrong amateur. Chasing the murderer takes Terry out of his TriBeCa neighborhood into the upper reaches of Harlem and back to the meat-packing district, where child prostitutes ply their trade. And discovering who planted the bomb in SoHo provides a challenge of another kind when Terry returns to the art world he once shared with his wife.As he struggles to beat back his demons at an Upper East Side therapist's office, at the Tilt-a-Whirl bar in TriBeCa, and on the Greenwich Village basketball courts, Terry focuses so intensely on his world's injustices that he is oblivious to his most important responsibility: to care for his daughter, who yearns for a father free of torment and grief.",

        "Description": "From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of A Summons to Memphis, here is a haunting new collection of stories that examine lost love, retribution, second chances, human perversities ... and ghosts.Peter Taylor draws us again into a world that he has made distinctively his own in his fiction, the comfortable society of affluent Tennesseeans - men and women of good character, with a sense of family, of style, and an awareness of the past that has shaped them. Yet for all their rootedness, other forces - often alien - intervene to change the course of fate in these entrancing, often chilling tales.In the long title story, we see the widow of a Tennessee congressman, long established in Washington, D.C., making ruthless use of her unearthly powers to play matchmaker for her shy young nephew.In \"Demons,\" a young boy hears voices that others do not (and which foretell his cousin's ruin).\"The Witch of Owl Mountain Springs\" is an aged spinster who carries out her revenge on the man who betrayed her when she was young and beautiful.In \"An Overwhelming Question,\" a young engaged couple get too caught up in a game of cat and mouse over whether or not to remain chaste before their honeymoon.A reserved young man undergoes a mysterious change of personality after he accompanies the body of his uncle on a funeral train (a story that forms part of Peter Taylor's forthcoming novel about Cousin Aubrey).In another story, told as a one-act play, a brother and sister are visited by the ghost of their father - but it is a very different ghost each one sees. Who is the real one?These and other dark questions surface and alter our consciousness in this rare and marvelous collection by a master teller of tales.",
