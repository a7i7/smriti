She doesn't know if Ariel Gold - the name on a Los Angeles driver's license - is hers. All she knows in her panic is that she is badly cut and bruised; she is in a house that has been viciously ransacked; and, on a crumpled heap of clothes, there is a blood-caked shirt, and a gun. In these gripping, nightmare moments, Judy Mercer's FAST FORWARD propels us onto a surefire track of nonstop, page-turning suspense.Alone, completely disoriented, \"Ariel\" begins her search through a strange house and a stranger's life, trying to find out who may be trying to harm her, and whom she can trust. She discovers that Ariel Gold has a vintage home, a classic car, a pedigreed dog, and a successful career as a producer for a television newsmagazine. She remembers none of them. Concealing her amnesia, she starts to improvise her life - moment by unpredictable moment.Back at work, Ariel uses all her ingenuity to grapple with a job she knows nothing about, aware that the friends, colleagues, and strangers she encounters may be sources of danger. Gradually, she uncovers a turbulent, painful past, and a present linked to the worlds of high-fashion modeling, the New York theater - and to murder. Those who knew the old Ariel are intrigued by her new persona, by subtle changes in the way she looks and acts - and the mystery around her deepens. With only her own wits to rely on, Ariel plunges from hope to despair and back again, as much an enigma to herself as she is to others. But someone is secretly watching her every move. The life she has inherited is no safe place to be...and her stubborn quest is leading her right into the sights of a killer.",

This unique collection includes speeches, interviews, lesson plans, essays, and a series of previously unpublished notes on the nature of fiction, all of which offer an unparalleled look at the writing life.

        "Authors": "By Teresi, Dick and Lederman, Leon M.",
        "Description": "\"Two leading physicists discuss the importance of the Higgs Boson, the future of particle physics, and the mysteries of the universe yet to be unraveled.  On July 4, 2012, the long-sought Higgs Boson--aka \"the God Particle\"--was discovered at the world'slargest particle accelerator, the LHC, in Geneva, Switzerland. On March 14, 2013, physicists at CERN confirmed it. This elusive subatomic particle forms a field that permeates the entire universe, creating the masses of the elementary particles that are the basic building blocks of everything in the known world--from viruses to elephants, from atoms to quasars.  Starting where Nobel Laureate Leon Lederman's bestseller The God Particle left off, this incisive new book explains what's next. Lederman and Hill discuss key questions that will occupy physicists for years to come:  * Why were scientists convinced that something like the \"God Particle\" had to exist?  * What new particles, forces, and laws of physics lie beyond the \"God Particle\"?  * What powerful new accelerators are now needed for the US to recapture a leadership role in science and to reach \"beyond the God Particle,\" such as Fermilab's planned Project-X and the Muon Collider?  Using thoughtful, witty, everyday language, the authors show how all of these intriguing questions are leading scientists ever deeper into the fabric of nature. Readers of The God Particle will not want to miss this important sequel\"--",

A day later, Paul has vanished. The months pass, Paul\u00eds ashes are delivered by a Chinese official to the American consulate in Beijing and a memorial service is held in Washington. But Horace is not convinced that Paul is dead and, enlisting the support of six other retired colleagues\u2014a sort of all-star backfield of the old Outfit\u2014Horace gets the \"Old Boys\" back in the game to find Paul Christopher.They start with a photo found in Paul\u00eds study: a woman\u00eds hand holding a centuries\u00ed old scroll, once in the possession of the Nazis and now sought by the U.S. government and Muslim extremists alike. Harassed by American intelligence, hunted by terrorists, Horace Christopher and the Old Boys travel the globe, from Xinjiang to Brazil, from Rome to Tel Aviv, Budapest to Moscow, in search of Paul and the unspeakably dangerous truth.",

He was never \"the one,\" but you lowered your standards and dated him in the meantime. Why? For any number of reasons: you were lonely, you were horny, you thought dating him was better than being alone, all your friends are getting married -- you name it. And before you knew it, you got hung up on the jerk. Go figure.The world is full of sensational women, but in today's market there are too few good men to go around (or so it appears). Now Dr. Ian Kerner, clinical sexologist and author of the smash hit She Comes First, explores the battlefield of sex, hook ups, go-nowhere relationships, and the dismal dating treadmill, simultaneously arming women with a sharper set of insights and the tools for change. With humor and sincerity, Kerner shows women how to break the cycle of dating defeat and use the power of sex to find love, \"with a great guy who is into you.\" So raise your standards -- and reach for the love you deserve!",

Drawing on the latest research and interviews with experts in different fields, the book sheds new light on the journey that is adolescence, the crucial interaction between mother and daughter, and the ways in which our own parenting skills must evolve as our daughters move into a new stage of their life. A recognized authority in the field of women's health, Dr. Nancy Snyderman tackles some of the often-repeated myths that surround adolescence, along with practical wisdom and sound advice. Filled with stories drawn from the authors' own experience mothering adolescent girls and from the experiences of women around the country, Girl in the Mirror is a bold and reassuring vision.",

        "Description": "Is the English language in decline?  Many people seem to think so--but Philip Howard isn't one of them.  The Literary Editor of The Times of London, Howard takes a robust, commonsensical view of the changes that are happening in English.  His is not the Panglossian attitude that all is neccessarily for the best in the best of all possible languages, but he does feel that change is necessary--and healthy--in any living language.    Howard here examines the language in its various branches and categories, such as grammar and pronunciation, spelling and punctuation, dialect and slang.  He discusses the effect the new technologies, from cable TV to photocomposition, are having on the mother tongue, and he examines the new dialects that are coming into use.  He navigates the back streets of euphemism and the broad, boring boulevards of cliche.  He asks whether the language is actually changing as fast as we suppose, and, if so, why.    Howard argues that as far as we can, we should strive to direct and control the changes in English in ways that increase its power.  And where we can't help it, he says, we should lie back and enjoy its immense richness, which is unrivaled by any other language. Rather than have us wring our hands, Philip Howard entreats us, with his customary with and erudition, to use our tongues in concert with our brains.  About the Author:  Philip Howard is the author of New Words for Old, Weasel Words, Words Fail Me, and, most recently, A Word in Your Ear.",

Told from the points of view of Herbert and of his daughters, this family story explores what it means to be a self-made man to the exclusion of all others - and the relationship between twins, whether you know you are one or not.",

Lavishly illustrated withDilbert\u00a0 strips, these hilarious essays on incompetent bosses, management fads, bewildering technological changes and so much more, will make anyone who has ever worked in an office laugh out loud in recognition.The Dilbert Principle: The most ineffective workers will be systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage -- management.Since 1989, Scott Adams has been illustrating this principle each day, lampooning the corporate world throughDilbert, his enormously popular comic strip. In Dilbert, the potato-shaped, abuse-absorbing hero of the strip, Adams has given voice to the millions of Americans buffeted by the many adversities of the workplace.Now he takes the next step, attacking corporate culture head-on in this lighthearted series of essays. Packed with more than 100 hilarious cartoons, these 25 chapters explore the zeitgeist of ever-changing management trends, overbearing egos, management incompetence, bottomless bureaucracies, petrifying performance reviews, three-hour meetings, the confusion of the information superhighway and more. With sharp eyes, and an even sharper wit, Adams exposes -- and skewers -- the bizarre absurdities of everyday corporate life. Readers will be convinced that he must be spying on their bosses,The Dilbert Principle rings so true!",

        "Title": "Parents Who Think Too Much: Why We Do It, How to Stop It",
        "Authors": "By Cassidy, Anne",
        "Description": "With the baby boom generation came the genre of parenting books that told parents how to teach their kids everything from toilet training to developing self-esteem. Generally the message has been: go easy on your child, but hard on yourself. It is starting to become apparent, especially in the best of families, that giving your kids lots of choices, validating their feelings at great peril to your own and providing \"enough\" individual attention for each child is creating a generation of kids over whom we have no control.Cassidy argues that this comes from over-thinking our role as parents. We've pondered every step so much that the juice, the joy, and worst of all, our confidence is gone. The reasons are clear: We have fewer children later in life so we've had more time to ponder. We've grown up just as research on infant and child development has come of age, so there's no shortage of material to think about. As a generation we've prided ourselves on self-improvement and we bring the same zeal to child improvement. We're less likely to live close to our families, and so are more likely to seek out expert solutions.To counter this thinking, Cassidy will suggest keeping the big picture in mind--what kind of people do you really want your kids to be? Honest, kind, cooperative, empathetic? It may mean losing sight of whether enough play dates are scheduled for the week and if you've positively reinforced the latest creative endeavor, but it will bring back your instincts about what is important to your family as a whole, and to your kids to become decent people.",

        "Authors": "By Talbott, Strobe",
        "Description": "During the past ten years, few issues have mattered more to America's vital interests or to the shape of the twenty-first century than Russia's fate. To cheer the fall of a bankrupt totalitarian regime is one thing; to build on its ruins a stable democratic state is quite another. The challenge of helping to steer post-Soviet Russia - with its thousands of nuclear weapons and seething ethnic tensions - between the Scylla of a communist restoration and the Charybdis of anarchy fell to the former governor of a poor, landlocked Southern state who had won national election by focusing on domestic issues. No one could have predicted that by the end of Bill Clinton's second term he would meet with his Kremlin counterparts more often than had all of his predecessors from Harry Truman to George Bush combined, or that his presidency and his legacy would be so determined by his need to be his own Russia hand.The book is dominated by two gifted, charismatic and flawed men, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, who quickly formed one of the most intense and consequential bonds in the annals of statecraft. It also sheds new light on Vladimir Putin, as well as the altered landscape after September 11, 2001.",

        "Title": "Eagle Against the Sun: The American War With Japan",
        "Authors": "By Spector, Ronald H.",
        "Description": "Historian Ronald H. Spector, drawing on declassified intelligence files, an abundance of British and American archival material, Japanese scholarship and documents, and the research and memoirs of scholars, politicians, and the military men, presents a thrilling narrative of American war in the Pacific.Spector reassesses U.S. and Japanese strategy and offers some provocative interpretations. He shows that the dual advance across the Pacific by MacArthur and Nimitz was less a product of strategic calculation and more a pragmatic solution to bureaucratic, doctrinal, and public relations problems facing the Army and Navy. He also argues that Japan made its fatal error not in the Midway campaign but in abandoning its offensive strategy after that defeat and allowing itself to be drawn into a war of attrition.Combining impeccable research with electrifying detail, Spector vividly recreates the major battles, little-known campaigns, and unfamiliar events of this brutal 44-month struggle. He reveals that the U.S. had secret plans to wage unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan months before Pearl Harbor and demonstrates that MacArthur and his commanders ignored important intercepts of Japanese messages that would have saved thousands of lives in Papua and Leyte. He skillfully takes the reader from top-secret strategy meetings in Washington, London, and Tokyo to distant beaches and remote Asian jungles with battle-weary GIs. Throughout, Spector contends that American decisions in the Pacific War were shaped more often by the struggles between the British and the Americans, and between the Army and the Navy, than by strategic considerations. Revealing what really happened in the course of a conflict that ended with the most deadly air raid ever, this contribution to WWII history adds a new dimension to our understanding of the people and forces that determined its outcome.",
