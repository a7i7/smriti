Today he's going to propose to Adrian Jenkins, his girlfriend of three years.  But when he actually does, all hell breaks loose and he gets a lot more than he bargained for.  His mother returns from France, where she's been living as a jazz singer since leaving her family in Texas nearly twenty years ago.  His Holy Roller sister, Shreese, complains that Adrian is too \"worldly\" for him, even though she herself is falling for the shady, charismatic pastor of her church.  And his boys-who run the gamut from player to buffoon-react to the news of his engagement with grief and disbelief. And if that's not enough, he's got Adrian, who has more skeletons in her closet than a haunted house.  What's a brother to do? When All Hell Breaks Loose is a debut novel about black twenty-somethings that is fast and funny.  It's also a peek into the minds of young black men.  Camika Spencer won't just have you laughing-she'll have you looking in the mirror to see if she's talking about you.",

While the aspiring politician Callicles propounds the view that might is right, and the rhetorician Gorgias argues that oratory and the power to persuade represent 'the greatest good', Socrates insists on the duty of politicians to consider the welfare of their citizens - a duty he believed had been dishonoured in the Athens of his time. The dialogue offers insights into how classical Athens was governed, as well as creating a theoretical framework that has been highly influential on subsequent political debate.",

        "Description": "Although it is customary to credit Freud's self-analysis, it may be more accurate, Alexander Welsh argues, to say that psychoanalysis began when The Interpretation of Dreams was published in the last weeks of the nineteenth century. Only by going public with his theory--that dreams manifest hidden wishes--did Freud establish a position to defend and embark upon a career. That position and career have been among the most influential in this century. In August 1899, Freud wrote to Wilhelm Fliess of the dream book in terms reminiscent of Dante's Inferno. Beginning from a dark wood, this modern journey features \"a concealed pass though which I lead the reader--my specimen dream with its peculiarities, details, indiscretions, bad jokes--and then suddenly the high ground and the view and the question, Which way do you wish to go now?\" Physician that he is, Freud appoints himself guide rather than hero, yet the way \"you\" wish to go is very much his prescribed way. In Welsh's book, readers are invited on Freud's journey, to pause at each concealed pass in his seminal work and ask where the guide is taking them and why. Along the way, Welsh shows how Freud's arbitrary turnings are themselves wishful, intended to persuade by pleasing the reader and author alike; that his interest in secrets and his self-proclaimed modest ambition are products of their time; and that the book may best be read as a romance or serial comedy. \"Some of the humor throughout,\" Welsh notes, \"can only be understood as a particular kind of fine performance.\" Welsh offers the first critical overview of the argument in Freud's masterpiece and of the author who presents himself as guide.",

        "Authors": "By Bergen, Peter L.",
        "Description": "On September 11, 2001, the world in which we live was changed forever. The twin towers of the World Trade Center came crashing down, one side of the Pentagon burst into flame, and more than six thousand men, women, and children lost their lives in the most deadly terrorist attack on American soil. As shocking as it was, it had been long in the making: The assault was the most sophisticated and horrifying in a series of operations masterminded by Osama bin Laden and his Jihad group -- an organization that CNN's terrorism analyst Peter Bergen calls Holy War, Inc.  One of only a handful of Western journalists to have interviewed the world's most wanted man face to face, Peter Bergen has produced the definitive book on the Jihadist network that operates globally and in secrecy. In the course of four years of investigative reporting, he has interviewed scores of insiders -- from bin Laden associates and family members to Taliban leaders to CIA officials -- and traveled to Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom to learn the truth about bin Laden's al Queda organization and his mission.  Immense in scope and unnerving in its findings, Holy War, Inc. reveals:   How bin Laden lives, travels, and communicates with his \"cells.\" How his role in the crushing defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan made him a hero to Muslims all over the world -- and equipped him to endure a long and bloody siege. How the CIA ended up funding -- to the tune of three billion dollars -- radical, anti-American Afghan groups allied to bin Laden. How the attacks that foreshadowed the destruction of the World Trade Center -- among them the bombings of the American embassies in Africa and the warship USS Cole in Yemen -- were planned and executed. The dimensions of bin Laden's personal fortune, and why freezing his assets is both futile and nearly impossible. The ideology of bin Laden's number two, the man who has influenced him most profoundly in his holy war -- the Egyptian Ayman al Zawahiri. What we can expect from Islamist extremists in the future.   Above all, Peter Bergen helps us to see bin Laden's organization in a radically new light: as a veritable corporation that has exploited twenty-first-century communications and weapons technologies in the service of a medieval reading of the Koran and holy war. Holy War, Inc. is essential reading for anyone trying to understand tomorrow's terrorist threats and the militant Islamist movements that could determine the fate of governments -- and human lives -- the world over.  Both author and publisher will donate a portion of the proceeds from this book to United Way's September 11th Fund for the relief of victims of the World Trade Center attacks.",

        "Authors": "By McCain, John and Salter, Mark",
        "Description": "In 1999, John McCain wrote one of the most acclaimed and bestselling memoirs of the decade, Faith of My Fathers. That book ended in 1972, with McCain\u2019s release from imprisonment in Vietnam. This is the rest of his story, about his great American journey from the U.S. Navy to his electrifying run for the presidency, interwoven with heartfelt portraits of the mavericks who have inspired him through the years\u2014Ted Williams, Theodore Roosevelt, visionary aviation proponent Billy Mitchell, Marlon Brando in Viva Zapata!, and, most indelibly, Robert Jordan. It was Jordan, Hemingway\u2019s protagonist in For Whom the Bell Tolls, who showed McCain the ideals of heroism and sacrifice, stoicism and redemption, and why certain causes, despite the costs, are . . .Worth the Fighting ForAfter five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, naval aviator John McCain returned home a changed man. Regaining his health and flight-eligibility status, he resumed his military career, commanding carrier pilots and serving as the navy\u2019s liaison to what is sometimes ironically called the world\u2019s most exclusive club, the United States Senate. Accompanying Senators John Tower and Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson on international trips, McCain began his political education in the company of two masters, leaders whose standards he would strive to maintain upon his election to the U.S. Congress. There, he learned valuable lessons in cooperation from a good-humored congressman from the other party, Morris Udall. In 1986, McCain was elected to the U.S. Senate, inheriting the seat of another role model, Barry Goldwater.During his time in public office, McCain has seen acts of principle and acts of craven self-interest. He describes both ex-tremes in these pages, with his characteristic straight talk and humor. He writes honestly of the lowest point in his career, the Keating Five savings and loan debacle, as well as his triumphant moments\u2014his return to Vietnam and his efforts to normalize relations between the U.S. and Vietnamese governments; his fight for campaign finance reform; and his galvanizing bid for the presidency in 2000.Writes McCain: \u201cA rebel without a cause is just a punk. Whatever you\u2019re called\u2014rebel, unorthodox, nonconformist, radical\u2014it\u2019s all self-indulgence without a good cause to give your life meaning.\u201d This is the story of McCain\u2019s causes, the people who made him do it, and the meaning he found. Worth the Fighting For reminds us of what\u2019s best in America, and in ourselves.",

They send him to live in Brooklyn with their friend Loretta, even though Brick knows that their elderly neighbors need his help to pick what\u2019s left of the apples. The only good thing about Brooklyn is seeing the Dodgers play\u2013that, and his friendship with Mariel.

When he looked at his own industry, however, he saw that the media far too often ignored their primary mission: to provide objective, disinterested reporting. Again and again he saw that the news slanted to the left. For years, Goldberg appealed to reporters, producers, and network executives for more balanced reporting, but no one listened. The liberal bias continued.Now, breaking ranks and naming names, he reveals a corporate news culture in which the closed-mindedness is breathtaking and in which entertainment wins over hard news every time.",

        "Authors": "By Bender, Sue",
        "Description": "Twenty years ago, while walking through a men's clothing store in\" Sag Harbor, New York, Sue Bender found herself drawn to an array of old Amish quilts that served as a background to a display of tweeds. She was immediately struck by their deep, saturated colors, the geometric simplicity of their design, and their quiet power. \"They spoke directly to me,\" she writes. \"They knew something.They went straight to my heart.\" That was the beginning of her \"journey of the spirit.\"Plain and Simple, illustrated with the author's own drawings, is the gentle, eloquent story of that journey. Bender, a wife, a mother, and a dedicated artist from Berkeley, California, sought out Amish families that would allow her-one of the outsiders the Amish call the \"English\"-- to visit and share in their daily fives.In language as spare and vivid as Amish art, Bender recounts her venture into an entirely different world, the seemingly timeless world of the Amish, a landscape of immense inner quiet. With an inquiring eye, she describes the months she spent in Iowa and Ohio with two Amish families. She illuminates the everyday rhythms of their world and conveys the life of the people who taught her about simplicity, commitment, and the joy of doing what you do well.In nine chapters, as interrelated and well-crafted as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt, Bender speaks to the seeker in us all and reveals how she was drawn to -- and changed by -- the Amish values of austerity, humility, and the ordinary. \"How\" they live reflects what they believe\" she writes. \"Their life is their art!\"After living and working with these people whose values were so unlike her own, Bender was able to return home and rework her \"crazy quilt\" life into a new pattern. \"I thought I was going to learn more about their quilts,\" she writes, \"but the quilts were only guides, leading me to what I really needed to learn, to answer a question I hadn't yet formed: \"Is there another way to lead a good life?\"",

        "Description": "One of the classics of English children's literature, and one of the earliest books written specifically for boys, this novel's steady popularity has given it an influence well beyond the upper middle-class world that it describes. It tells a story central to an understanding of Victorian life, but its freshness helps to distinguish it from the narrow schoolboy adventures that it later inspired. The book includes an introduction and notes by Andrew Sanders.",

By Zola's death in 1902 it had come to symbolize the call for freedom from oppression so forcefully that the crowd which gathered at his State funeral chanted \"Germinal! Germinal!\"  While it is a dramatic novel of working life and everyday relationships, Germinal is also a complex novel of ideas, given fresh vigor and power in this new translation. It is also the thirteenth book in the Rougon-Macquart cycle, which celebrates its centenary in October 1993 with a new film version of Germinal starring Gerard Depardieu.",

This portion of the book includes 150 maps, lists of species of interest, a summary of each county's history, and site-by-site descriptions of parks, beaches, rivers, wetlands, coastal towns and cities, missions, museums, and other coastal resources; detailed information on the habitats, wildlife, and history of each site are included, as well as its address, and, where applicable, the phone number.Copiously illustrated, accessible, and above all, entertaining, this book is an indispensable reference guide for residents and vacationers as well as a fun book to browse in for anyone interested in California's coast.",

        "Authors": "By Caudill, Maureen",
        "Description": "From Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator, to C-3PO of the Star Wars trilogy, to the comic robot-butler in Woody Allen's Sleeper, the \"android\" has long been a familiar figure on the American imaginative landscape. But how far removed from reality are such fictitious creations? Will there ever be an intelligent robot in our future? Neural networks expert Maureen Caudill says yes. In fact, she argues that the development of intelligent androids is a mere twenty years away.    In Our Own Image reveals just how far we've come in developing an intelligent robot, describes what technical obstacles must still be cleared, and--perhaps most interesting of all--outlines the potentially massive social disruptions and tangled moral and legal dilemmas these \"human machines\" will cause. In a sweeping look at state-of-the-art breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer science, psychology, and neural networks, Caudill shows how these fields have advanced machine vision, language recognition, problem solving, memory, and other requisites of intelligent robots. She describes foot-long mechanical ants that can follow you around a room, robots that can crack eggs, shear sheep, play ping-pong, tighten wing-nuts, and other feats of dexterity. (One robot, WABOT-2, developed in Japan, can read simple sheet music and played the electric organ with the NHK Symphony Orchestra of Japan.) electric organ.) And she concludes that as our ability to make faster, smaller, cheaper computers blends with our ability to mimic the behavior of the human mind, the first truly intelligent machines come closer to fruition. But once an android has been perfected, Caudill warns, there will likely be some unexpected--and perhaps unpleasant--social changes. Androids may compete with human workers for jobs--and robots won't take vacations, won't have family problems, and might never leave the firm. Androids may also entangle our legal system in complex, difficult questions: Can an individual own an intelligent android? What rights should it have in society? Does ownership of an android imply the right to turn it off--the right to \"kill\" it? And does such ownership brand us as slaveholders?    The existence of intelligent androids will provoke these and other questions. Caudill concludes that we will soon be forced to come up with answers if we are to learn to share the world with another intelligent species--one of our own creation.",

To date, these books have sold two and a half million copies, and continue to hit bestseller lists every week.   The Education of the Heart \u00a0 gives readers access to the wellspring of wisdom that Moore drew on when creating these seminal works. Ideal for reading groups, the book includes a study guide that offers suggestions for discussion. Selected not only for their brilliance in describing the soul, but for the beauty and power of their language, the essays, poems, songs and passages included here make the book a truly rewarding reading experience. Arranged into chapters devoted to topics such as marriage and intimacy, common life, dwelling and home and life passages, these selections are taken from a rich variety of sources: from Greek tragedies and ancient magical texts; from the Renaissance philosophers such as Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola; and from modern archetypal psychologists such as C. G. Jung and James Hillman.  As Thomas Moore says in his introduction, \"Meditate on the book, read the passages aloud, write them down for future reference, tell them to friends, commit them to memory; These are all ways of educating the heart.\"",

        "Title": "Leaving Town Alive: Confessions of an Arts Warrior",
        "Authors": "By Frohnmayer, John",
        "Description": "Brimming with optimism, John Frohnmayer journeyed to Washington, D.C., in 1989 to serve a cause he believed in deeply: the arts in America. Appointed by President Bush to be chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, he was abruptly fired two and a half years later in a storm of front-page controversy.Leaving Town Alive is Frohnmayer's lively and startlingly candid account of his trial by fire in the brutal world of power politics. Taking over the NEA amid the uproar about Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photographs, Frohnmayer stood at the center of the emotional debate over public funding for the arts. On the left were staunch defenders of free speech and the artists whose confrontational works came under attack. On the right were Jesse Helms and the fundamentalist proponents of traditional values.At first Frohnmayer assumed that he could negotiate anything and that everyone had the best interests of the country at heart. He was wrong: the White House, for instance, just wanted the problem of \"offensive art\" to go away, while right-wing fund-raisers wanted to keep the issue alive as long as possible. In the end, Frohnmayer's harrowing education changed him. He entered the fray a First Amendment moderate; he emerged a free-speech radical.John Frohnmayer had an insider's view of Washington during the Bush years, and he writes with remarkable frankness about the bitter battles over the government's involvement in the arts. Passionate, witty, and wonderfully readable, Leaving Town Alive is, finally, an eloquent plea for the liberation of American culture from the narrow concerns of partisan politics.",

        "Title": "Silent Sons: A Book for and About Men",
        "Authors": "By Ackerman, Robert J.",
        "Description": "It could be you or someone you love. Strong, silent types are everywhere, and it is their telltale silence that has kept their problems hidden until now. A silent son can come from a family that coped with violence, alcoholism, child abuse, extreme rigidity, or divorce, but all silent sons have certain common characteristics:   They keep things that bother them to themselves.  They deny that unpleasant events occur.  They fear letting people know them.  They have difficulty interacting with their parents, spouses, or children.  They have a strong fear of criticism.  They are often angry.   In Silent Sons, Dr. Robert Ackerman, a silent son himself, examines the problems that commonly confront silent sons, keeping them from experiencing the full range of human emotions. In a compassionate and hopeful voice, the author defines the silent son and examines the impact of parents, particularly fathers, on these men and shows how their dysfunctional upbringing affects their present relationships, especially with women.  By putting aside anger, finding peace with one's self, and looking for support from other silent sons, Dr. Ackerman feels every man can realize his full potential and become a well balanced, healthy survivor.",

        "Authors": "By Evans, Walker and Rathbone, Belinda",
        "Description": "Walker Evan's photographs are American classics. His legendary images of southern sharecroppers in LET US NOW PRAISE FAMOUS MEN and his pictures documenting the Depression era make up a haunting protrayal of the American soul. Until now, though, the man behind those well-known images has remained elusive, by his own design. In this first full biography, a leading authority on Evans penetrates the anonymity of his legendary photographs to reveal A VERY RICH AND INCLUSIVE LIFE OF FOOLISHNESS, CRUELTY, AND SPLENDOR, SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE. A portrait of an artist who profoundly influenced the generation of photographers who followed him, WALKER EVANS also traces the artstically fecund times that nurtured him. His career provides a NEW AND PENETRATING ILLUMINATION, ST LOUIS POST-DISPATCH, of everything from the newly established Museum of Modern Art to President Roosevelt's troubled Farm Security Adminsistratiion. WALKER EVANS is a thoroughly engrossing biography of a unique American master.",

        "Title": "What Went Wrong?: Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response",
        "Authors": "By Lewis, Bernard",
        "Description": "For many centuries, the world of Islam was in the forefront of human achievement--the foremost military and economic power in the world, the leader in the arts and sciences of civilization. Christian Europe, a remote land beyond its northwestern frontier, was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed, as the previously despised West won victory after victory, first in the battlefield and the marketplace, then in almost every aspect of public and even private life.    In this intriguing volume, Bernard Lewis examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to understand why things had changed--how they had been overtaken, overshadowed, and to an increasing extent dominated by the West. Lewis provides a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil. He shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry and military tactics, commerce and industry, government and diplomacy, education and culture. Lewis highlights the striking differences between the Western and Middle Eastern cultures from the 18th to the 20th centuries through thought-provoking comparisons of such things as Christianity and Islam, music and the arts, the position of women, secularism and the civil society, the clock and the calendar.   Hailed in The New York Times Book Review as \"the doyen of Middle Eastern studies,\" Bernard Lewis is one of the West's foremost authorities on Islamic history and culture. In this striking volume, he offers an incisive look at the historical relationship between the Middle East and Europe.",
