At the heart of his story, Farrell narrates his public struggle to be a responsible citizen of the world. From his firsthand accounts of the ravages of war and oppression in Cambodia, El Salvador, Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda, and the Gaza Strip, to his tireless advocacy against capital punishment, to his deep commitment to environmental causes, Farrell portrays each of these experiences with passion, outrage, and stubborn optimism.",

        "Authors": "By McNamara, Robert S. and Vandemark, Brian",
        "Description": "Robert S. McNamara, the brilliant secretary of defense for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, helped lead America into Vietnam. McNamara believed that the fight against communism in Asia was worth the sacrifice of American lives, and yet he eventually came to believe that the war was, in fact, unwinnable. Outnumbered by those who wanted to continue fighting, he left the Johnson administration and his involvement in Vietnam behind. He refused any public comment on the war, and for almost three decades he has kept that silence - until now.Drawing on his personal experience and a wealth of documentation - much of it only recently declassified and some presented here for the first time ever - McNamara has crafted the classic insider account of Vietnam policy making. He reveals exactly how we stumbled into the war, and exactly why it quickly became so difficult to pull out. We meet John F. Kennedy, and McNamara discloses what he believes Kennedy would have done in Vietnam had he lived. We get to know Lyndon B. Johnson, and see exactly how the war tore him apart and damaged his entire presidency. We sit in on secret meetings, we read private cables, and we hear the voices and arguments of the men who battled over America's Vietnam policy. McNamara takes us into the Oval Office for late-night discussions with the president, into the halls of the Pentagon as military strategy is argued, and into the chambers of Congress as policy is debated. He also reveals his own inner torment as the war effort becomes increasingly frustrating, and then utterly disastrous. The result is a book that is not only history of the highest order, but a revealing portrait of the trials of leadership.",

        "Description": "Elizabeth D. Samet and her students learned to romanticize the army \u201cfrom the stories of their fathers and from the movies.\u201d For Samet, it was the old World War II movies she used to watch on TV, while her students grew up onBraveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Unlike their teacher, however, these students, cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, have decided to turn make-believe into real life.\u00a0West Point is a world away from Yale, where Samet attended graduate school and where nothing sufficiently prepared her for teaching literature to young men and women who were training to fight a war. Intimate and poignant,Soldier\u2019s Heart chronicles the various tensions inherent in that life as well as the ways in which war has transformed Samet\u2019s relationship to literature. Fighting in Iraq, Samet\u2019s former students share what books and movies mean to them\u2014the poetry of Wallace Stevens, the fiction of Virginia Woolf and J. M. Coetzee, the epics of Homer, or the films of James Cagney. Their letters in turn prompt Samet to wonder exactly what she owes to cadets in the classroom.\u00a0Samet arrived at West Point before September 11, 2001, and has seen the academy change dramatically. InSoldier\u2019s Heart, she reads this transformation through her own experiences and those of her students. Forcefully examining what it means to be a civilian teaching literature at a military academy, Samet also considers the role of women in the army, the dangerous tides of religious and political zeal roiling the country, the uses of the call to patriotism, and the cult of sacrifice she believes is currently paralyzing national debate. Ultimately, Samet offers an honest and original reflection on the relationship between art and life.",

        "Title": "My Freshman Year: What a Professor Learn By Becoming a Student",
        "Authors": "By Nathan, Rebekah",
        "Description": "After more than fifteen years of teaching, Rebekah Nathan, a professor of anthropology at a large state university, realized that she no longer understood the behavior and attitudes of her students. Fewer and fewer participated in class discussion, tackled the assigned reading, or came to discuss problems during office hours. And she realized from conversations with her colleagues that they, too, were perplexed: Why were students today so different and so hard to teach? Were they, in fact, more likely to cheat, ruder, and less motivated? Did they care at all about their education, besides their grades?Nathan decided to put her wealth of experience in overseas ethnographic fieldwork to use closer to home and apply to her own university. Accepted on the strength of her high school transcript, she took a sabbatical and enrolled as a freshman for the academic year. She immersed herself in student life, moving into the dorms and taking on a full course load. She ate in the student cafeteria, joined student clubs, and played regular pick-up games of volleyball and tag football (sports at which the athletic fifty-something-year-old could hold her own). Nathan had resolved that, if asked, she would not lie about her identity; she found that her classmates, if they were curious about why she was attending college at her age, never questioned her about her personal life.Based on her interviews and conversations with fellow classmates, her interactions with professors and with other university employees and offices, and her careful day-to-day observations, My Freshman Year provides a compelling account of college life that should be read by students, parents, professors, university administrators, and anyone else concerned about the state of higher education in America today. Placing her own experiences and those of her classmates into a broader context drawn from national surveys of college life, Nathan finds that today's students face new challenges to which academic institutions have not adapted. At the end of her freshman year, she has an affection and respect for students as a whole that she had previously reserved only for certain individuals. Being a student, she discovers, is hard work. But she also identifies fundamental misperceptions, misunderstandings, and mistakes on both sides of the educational divide that negatively affect the college experience.By focusing on the actual experiences of students, My Freshman Year offers a refreshing alternative to the frequently divisive debates surrounding the political, economic, and cultural significance of higher education\u2014as well as a novel perspective from which to look at the achievements and difficulties confronting America's colleges and universities in the twenty-first century.",

Just as she\u2019s claiming an especially gratifying victory in a rape case, she gets the call: the body of a young woman has been found in an abandoned building.  The brutality of the murder is disturbing enough, but when a second body, beaten and disposed of in exactly same manner, is found off the Belt Parkway, the city\u2019s top brass want the killer found fast, before the tabloids can start churning out ghoulish serial killer headlines.Between dodging the bullets of the gang members who are infuriated by Alex\u2019s most recent courtroom victory and keeping a rendezvous with a charming restaurateur, a serial killer on the loose is the last thing she needs on her plate right now. Then a third victim is found, and it becomes clear to Alex and her team that time is not on their side.Through Alex\u2019s peerless interrogation skills\u2014and one big break\u2014the search becomes focused on someone who has a twisted obsession with the military, and things grow increasingly dangerous when the chase leads to a chain of small, abandoned islands around New York harbor.Once again Linda Fairstein brilliantly orchestrates a page-turning mix of cutting-edge legal issues and forensics, New York City history, and spine-tingling suspense. And at the center of it all is Alex Cooper\u2014stunning, single-minded, accomplished, and not to be trifled with whether she\u2019s in or out of a courtroom.",

        "Authors": "By Wendel, Tim, Bostas, Bob (FRW), and Baldizon, Victor (PHT)",
        "Description": "For decades, Americans have been fascinated by the complexity and rich history of baseball. No other sport has captivated so many fans. The New Face of Baseball explores a different chapter in baseball's chronicles, one often ignored but remarkably influential. Into the tapestry of baseball history, Tim Wendel weaves the stories of its Latino athletes -- who they are and how they helped transform the sport into what it is today.Going as far back as the mid-nineteenth century, to the early days of Cuban baseball, Wendel traces the spread of American baseball fever in the Caribbean and Mexico, and discusses lesser-known historical standouts, including Adolfo Luque, the first Hispanic to play in the World Series (in 1923), and Martin Dihigo, a black Cuban whom many baseball insiders consider the greatest ballplayer of all time.Wendel masterfully describes the days when only light-skinned Latinos were allowed to participate in Major League competition, much like their inspirational African American counterparts, and the linguistic barrier Latinos were confronted with when playing on teams with \"English-only\" rules inside their dugouts.Featuring material on Roberto Clemente, Fernando Valenzuela, and Sammy Sosa, as well as interviews with Latino superstars past and present -- such as Alex Rodriguez, Ivan Rodriguez, Mariano Rivera, Alfonso Soriano, and the Hernandez brothers -- The New Face of Baseball helps fans of America's favorite pastime to understand the history of those who bring hope and honor every season to the teams they have given their lives to, and the Hispanic culture that, if allowed, can lie hidden and unnoticed under a team jersey.With a foreword by Bob Costas, the first-ever-published Latino All-Century Team featuring players selected by Omar Minaya, and photos taken by award-winning Sports Illustrated photographer Victor Baldizon, this important book is sure to make as much of a splash a the Latino players themselves -- the new faces of baseball.",

Dwight Gooden -- a.k.a. Doc or simply Dr. K -- had a fastball that hitters just could not beat.  But Gooden's fall was as quick and dramatic as his rise.  By 1994 he had twice been suspended from the league for drug abuse, plunging him into a vicious cycle that threatened his career and, ultimately, his life.Today, Dwight Gooden is back in the big leagues.  Heat captures Gooden's poignant road to recovery, and how it culminated in his second World Series ring with the New York Yankees in 1996, and offers a behind-the-scenes look at the Yankees club.  During his fourteen years in the big leagues, Dwight Gooden has seen plenty.

        "Description": "Nearly two decades ago Hank Hanegraaff\u2019s award-winning Christianity in Crisis alerted the world to the dangers of a cultic movement within Christianity that threatened to undermine the very foundation of biblical faith. But in the 21st century, there are new dangers\u2014new teachers who threaten to do more damage than the last.These are not obscure teachers that Hanegraaff unmasks. We know their names. We have seen their faces, sat in their churches, and heard them shamelessly preach and promote the false pretexts of a give-to-get gospel. They are virtual rock stars who command the attention of presidential candidates and media moguls. Through make-believe miracles, urban legends, counterfeit Christs, and twisted theological reasoning, they peddle an occult brand of metaphysics that continues to shipwreck the faith of millions around the globe:\u201cGod cannot do anything in this earthly realm unless we give Him permission.\u201d\u201cKeep saying it\u2014\u2018I have equality with God\u2019\u2014talk yourself into it.\u201d\u201cBeing poor is a sin.\u201d\u201cThe Jews were not rejecting Jesus as Messiah; it was Jesus who was refusing to be the Messiah to the Jews!\u201d\u201cYou create your own world the same way God creates His. He speaks, and things happen; you speak, and they happen.\u201dChristianity in Crisis: 21st Century exposes darkness to light, pointing us back to a Christianity centered in Christ.From the Preface:\u201cHaving lost the ability to think biblically, postmodern Christians are being transformed from cultural change agents and initiators into cultural conformists and imitators. Pop culture beckons, and postmodern Christians have taken the bait. As a result, the biblical model of faith has given way to an increasingly bizarre array of fads and formulas.\u201d",

        "Title": "A Saint on Death Row: The Story of Dominique Green",
        "Authors": "By Cahill, Thomas",
        "Description": "On October 26, 2004, Dominique Green, thirty, was executed by lethal injection in Huntsville, Texas. Arrested at the age of eighteen in the fatal shooting of a man during a robbery outside a Houston convenience store, Green may have taken part in the robbery but always insisted that he did not pull the trigger. The jury, which had no African Americans on it, sentenced him to death. Despite obvious errors in the legal procedures and the protests of the victim\u2019s family, he spent the last twelve years of his life on Death Row. When Cahill found himself in Texas in December 2003, he visited Dominique at the request of Judge Sheila Murphy, who was working on the appeal of the case. In Dominique, he encountered a level of goodness, peace, and enlightenment that few human beings ever attain. Cahill joined the fierce fight for Dominique\u2019s life, even enlisting Dominique\u2019s hero, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, to make an historic visit to Dominique and to plead publicly for mercy. Cahill was so profoundly moved by Dominique\u2019s extraordinary life that he was compelled to tell the tragic story of his unjust death at the hands of the state.A Saint on Death Row will introduce you to a young man whose history, innate goodness, and final days you will never forget. It also shines a necessary light on America\u2019s racist and deeply flawed legal system. A Saint on Death Row is an absorbing, sobering, and deeply spiritual story that illuminates the moral imperatives too often ignored in the headlong quest for justice.",

There are few places left in society that allow for real intergenerational connections to be made, yet these connections are vital for any church that seeks to reflect the fullness of the body of Christ.

There are few places left in society that allow for real intergenerational connections to be made, yet these connections are vital for any church that seeks to reflect the fullness of the body of Christ. Using the metaphor of a tribe to describe the close bonds that form when people of all ages decide to walk together on their spiritual journeys, Merritt casts a vision of the church that embraces the gifts of all members while reaching out to those who might otherwise feel unwelcome or unneeded. Mainline churches have much to offer young adults, as well as much to learn from them. By breaking down artificial age barriers and building up intentional relationships, congregations can provide a space for all people to connect with God, each other, and the world.",

        "Authors": "By Kelley, Sheila",
        "Description": "Hipper than Taebo, sexier than Pilates, The S Factor--stripping--is the hottest new fitness trend. Created by actress Sheila Kelley (LA Law, Sisters, and a host of film and Broadway roles), S-Factor classes are wildly popular and generating an avalanche of attention from Extra, Entertainment Tonight, The Los Angeles Times, Allure, Us magazine, Fox News, and CBS's 48 Hours, which proclaimed: \"Women don't even know they're working out until two months later when they say, 'I've never had a better body in my life. I'm strong, I'm limber, I feel great.'\" Sheila even convinced Barbara Walters to try a pole dance on The View.No wonder. Combining yoga, dance, and erotic movements, The S Factor is a program that tones muscle, firms the body, increases flexibility, promotes weight loss, and gives you a few new tricks for the bedroom. Illustrated in hundreds of photographs that show step by step how each move is done, the exercises are sensual yet demanding, requiring a balance of strength and finesse. There are slow, rounded warm-ups, the Spine Circles and Hip Circles. Strenuous motions, like the Rocking Cat-Cow. Peels and rolls, grinds, pounces, arches. And pole work, from the Firefly to Descending Angel.Something else happens, too: These exercises and routines boost self-esteem and give women a new way to think about their bodies. Stripping is a liberating act, out of which comes a new look, new body, new confidence, new you.",

Every time a golfer thinks of quitting, the game entices him back with a 250-yard drive down the middle, an unfathomable recovery shot to the green, or a birdie on the hardest hole, as if to say, \"You're almost there, just a little more work and you'll get it. Any day now you'll have the game figured out and when you do you'll be the envy of all.\" But it's not going to happen and everyone knows it, because no one gets any better at this game.  The perfect gift for the golfer who just can't get enough, How to Quit Golf offers the guidance, counseling and tough love necessary to abstain from the most addictive, demanding and maddening game known to man. And if quitting isn't an option, Craig Brass's \"12-Step Program\" makes it clear that laughing is.",

This book is for anyone concerned about such issues as:* Churches hosting politicians and insisting they give testaments of their faith* Science teachers questioning the theory of evolution in their public school classrooms* Public religious debates on private issues involving end-of-life decisions and reproductive choices* Federal funding for religious organizations, including those that discriminate openlyWith religion a constant presence in political discussions, First Freedom First offers practical and easy ways to remind our leaders and our community of the importance of keeping religion and politics separate, for the sake of both institutions.",

Piper found purpose in his pain, he found the message in the mess, and so can anyone else who embraces God's grace in the here and now-as well as the Hereafter.

There he witnessed first-hand the ongoing  genocide, and documented every day of his experience  using email, audio journals, notebook after  notebook and nearly 1,000 photographs. Gretchen  Steidle Wallace, his sister, who wrote this book with  Brian, corresponded with him throughout his time in  Darfur. Fired upon, taken hostage, a witness to villages  destroyed and people killed, frustrated by his mission's  limitations and the international community's reluctance  to intervene, Steidle resigned and has since become an  advocate for the world to step in and stop this genocide.  The Devil Came on Horseback depicts the tragic impact  of an Arab government bent on destroying its black  African citizens, the maddening complexity of international  inaction in response to blatant genocide, and the  awkward, yet heroic transformation of a formerMarine  turned humanitarian. It is a gripping and moving memoir  that bears witness to atrocities we have too long averted  our eyes from, and reveals that the actions of just one  committed person have the power to change the world.",

        "Description": "In Israel/Palestine, Reinhart traces the development of the Security Barrier and Israel\u2019s new doctrine of \"disengagement,\" launched in response to a looming Palestinian-majority population. Examining the official record of recent diplomacy, including United States\u2013brokered accords and talks at Camp David, Oslo, and Taba, Reinhart explores the fundamental power imbalances between the negotiating parties and identifies Israel\u2019s strategy of creating facts on the ground to define and complicate the terms of any future settlement. In this indispensable primer, Reinhart\u2019s searing insight illuminates the current conflict and suggests a path toward change.",

        "Description": "Rightly understood and rightly communicated, the Christian faith is one of great joy. It is an invitation to God\u2019s kingdom, where tears are replaced by laughter and longing hearts find their purpose and their home. This is the heart of the gospel: God\u2019s search to reclaim us and love us as his own. But have we truly grasped this? Those of us who have disdained Christianity as a religion of bigotry\u2014have we repudiated the genuine article or merely demonstrated our own prejudice and ignorance? Those of us who are Christians\u2014have we deeply apprehended the mission of Jesus, and do our ways and character faithfully reflect his beauty? From the nature of God, to the human condition, to the work of Jesus, to God\u2019s coming kingdom, and all that lies between, how well do we understand the foundational truths of Christianity and their implications? The Faith is a book for our troubled times and for decades to come, for Christians and non-Christians alike. It is the most important book Chuck Colson and Harold Fickett have ever written: a thought-provoking, soul-searching, and powerful manifesto of the great, historical central truths of Christianity that have sustained believers through the centuries. Brought to immediacy with vivid, true stories, here is what Christianity is really about and why it is a religion of hope, redemption, and beauty.",

Its greatest merit derives from the author's determination always to ask fundamental questions, his care to discriminate between surface phenomena and deeper causes, his skill in finding significant patterns in an apparently chaotic welter of events, his facility for perceptive and penetrating distinctions and generalizations.
