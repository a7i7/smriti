        "Description": "Every autumn, readers of short stories eagerly look forward to the chance to discover their favorite writers and new talents in The Best American Short Stories. Last year's collection marched on to bestseller lists across the country and met with acclaim from critics who declared it \"a brilliant work of art.\" Marking the eightieth anniversary of the series, the 1995 volume portrays the stunning range of American life in all its various colors, styles, regions, and concerns. This year's guest editor, Jane Smiley, selected stories without knowing their authors' identities. Drawn to tales with \"a sharp taste,\" she gathered a piquant sampling of new voices as well as rich works by such masters as Don DeLillo, Ellen Gilchrist, Thom Jones, Joy Williams, Stephen Dobyns, Kate Braverman, and Jamaica Kincaid. Smiley was attracted to \"an element of the exotic\" in the tapestry of ordinary lives, and the stories in this collection reveal the powerful dramas constantly unfolding beneath the surface",

        "Description": "Bob Wright opens this work by approvingly quoting an earlier NBC chairman's offer to put all \"of our facilities and personnel\" at the \"instant service\" of the President of the United States during an earlier war. That same sentiment sums up NBC's broadcasts during \"Operation Iraqi Freedom,\" as well as this work, a pictorial celebration of NBC and its involvement in the American invasion of Iraq. The experience of the \"embedded\" war is described in words and pictures from early preparations in Kuwait to the fall of Baghdad, complete with the requisite pictures of Iraqi children waving American flags and American soldiers receiving flowers from the gratefully \"liberated.\" The side of the war that many regular Iraqis and a significant number of U.S. soldiers saw (i.e. blood and non-super-mediated destruction) receives limited attention. The DVD contains \"highlights\" of the coverage in addition to postwar interviews and commentary. Much like NBC's war, it is narrated by anchor Tom Brokaw.

        "Description": "Soon after the fall of the Taliban, in 2001, Deborah Rodriguez went to Afghanistan as part of a group offering humanitarian aid to this war-torn nation. Surrounded by men and women whose skills\u2013as doctors, nurses, and therapists\u2013seemed eminently more practical than her own, Rodriguez, a hairdresser and mother of two from Michigan, despaired of being of any real use. Yet she soon found she had a gift for befriending Afghans, and once her profession became known she was eagerly sought out by Westerners desperate for a good haircut and by Afghan women, who have a long and proud tradition of running their own beauty salons. Thus an idea was born. With the help of corporate and international sponsors, the Kabul Beauty School welcomed its first class in 2003. Well meaning but sometimes brazen, Rodriguez stumbled through language barriers, overstepped cultural customs, and constantly juggled the challenges of a postwar nation even as she learned how to empower her students to become their families\u2019 breadwinners by learning the fundamentals of coloring techniques, haircutting, and makeup.Yet within the small haven of the beauty school, the line between teacher and student quickly blurred as these vibrant women shared with Rodriguez their stories and their hearts: the newlywed who faked her virginity on her wedding night, the twelve-year-old bride sold into marriage to pay her family\u2019s debts, the Taliban member\u2019s wife who pursued her training despite her husband\u2019s constant beatings. Through these and other stories, Rodriguez found the strength to leave her own unhealthy marriage and allow herself to love again, Afghan style.With warmth and humor, Rodriguez details the lushness of a seemingly desolate region and reveals the magnificence behind the burqa. Kabul Beauty School is a remarkable tale of an extraordinary community of women who come together and learn the arts of perms, friendship, and freedom.",

It is the story of an illness, a fight to live, and a race against death.\"From the day he was born, Nick Traina was his mother's joy. By nineteen, he was dead. This is Danielle Steel's powerful personal story of the son she lost and the lessons she learned during his courageous battle against darkness. Sharing tender, painful memories and Nick's remarkable journals, Steel brings us a haunting duet between a singular young man and the mother who loved him--and a harrowing portrait of a masked killer called manic depression, which afflicts between two and three million Americans.Nick rocketed through life like a shooting star. Signs of his illness were subtle, often paradoxical. He spoke in full sentences at age one. He was a brilliant, charming child who never slept. And at first, even his mother explained away his quicksilver moods. Nick always marched to a different drummer. His gift for writing was extraordinary, his musical talent promised a golden future. But by the time he entered junior high, Danielle Steel saw her beloved son hurtling toward disaster and tried desperately to get Nick the help he needed--the opening salvos of what would become a ferocious pitched battle for his life.Even as he struggled, Nick's charisma and accomplishments remained undimmed. He bared his soul in his journal with uncanny insight, in searing prose, poetry, and song. When he was finally diagnosed and treated, it bought time, but too little. In the end, perhaps nothing could have saved him from the insidious disease that had shadowed him from his earliest years.At once a loving legacy and an unsparing depiction of a devastating illness, Danielle Steel's tribute to her lost son is a gift of life, hope, healing, and understanding to us all.",

As in the past, this book will be extremely valuable to students and professionals at many different levels: undergraduates studying psychopharmacology or neurobiology, medical students, graduate students in pharmacology and neuroscience, neuroscientists and residents and practitioners in neurology and psychiatry.",

        "Authors": "By WEINBERG, Steven",
        "Description": "From one of the world's most distinguished scientists, here is the story of a great intellectual adventure of our time: the search for nature's final laws.The success of physics in this century has been stunning, transforming our views of space and time, of reality and knowing, changing the very language we use to describe nature. At the close of the century we stand in possession of a new view of the universe, one in which the old centrality of matter is gone, and nature's symmetries lie at the core of our understanding. The driving force behind these revolutions in thought has been the search for the ultimate laws of nature - for the final answer to our questions about why nature is the way it is.In Dreams of a Final Theory, Steven Weinberg imagines the shape of a final theory, and the effect its discovery will have on the human spirit. Along the way he gives a spirited defense of reductionism - the impulse to trace the explanations of natural phenomena to deeper and deeper levels - and examines the curious relevance of beauty in scientific theories. He gives us a compelling personal account of the search for the laws of nature as a part of the intellectual history of our times, and shares with us the glimpses that scientists have had from time to time that there is something behind the blackboard - a deeper truth foreshadowing a final theory.",

Raised in the segregated South and one of thirteen children, eight of whom were brought up together in a tiny two-bedroom house, Flake went on to become a member of the U.S. Congress, dean of a major university, and pastor of one of America&#39;s largest churches--a church that has become a nationally renowned model of community development.  Yet what is most inspiring about Reverend Flake is his enthusiasm to motivate people to pick themselves up by their bootstraps, rely on their boundless personal resources, and become doers!What is Bootstrapping? A process--to achieve success by making it against all odds. A mind-set--to take responsibility for your thoughts, feelings, words, actions, and life circumstances. A value system--to transform your relationship with yourself, your neighbors, and your environment. Bootstrapping is the strategy our ancestors used to raise families, work the land, start new businesses, run the government, build wealth, and care for the less fortunate. The Way of the Bootstrapper shows you how to use this creative and empowering approach to life to fulfill your passions, talents, and dreams.",

        "Description": "In the heat of midsummer, in 1960, nineteen-year-old Deborah and several other young women share a cab to a convent on the Iowa bluffs of the Mississippi River. The girls, passionate to become nuns, heedless of all they are leaving behind, smoke their last cigarettes along the way and enter their life as postulants. In the same precise and beautifully crafted prose that distinguished her successful novel The White (\u201ca brutal and beautiful novel\u201d\u2013The New York Times), Larsen\u2019s memoir lets us into the hushed life inside the convent. We learn about such practices as \u201ccustody of the eyes,\u201d the proper devotion to the rule of one\u2019s superiors, and the importance of avoiding \u201cparticular friendships.\u201d Her intimate episodic account captures the exquisite sense of peace\u2013even of Presence\u2013that dwelt among the women, as well as the strangeness of living under such strict rules. Gradually, she admits to a growing awareness that there is much life and beauty outside the motherhouse, which she is missing. The physical world\u2013the lush experience of the tulip she stared at in the garden as a girl, the snow she tunneled in, and even the mystery of sex\u2013begins to seem to her a significant alternative theater for a deep understanding and love of God. With The Tulip and the Pope, Larsen delivers a swift and moving exploration of Christian experience and young womanhood in a more innocent time, and a message of devotion that extends far beyond the high walls of the convent.",

        "Description": "Forced out of a self-imposed exile, one woman faces a lifetime\u2019s worth of secrets and betrayal\u2013all in the name of staying alive. Nicole Blake had planned to leave her criminal life in the past. She had done her time in a dank prison in Marseille and relinquished the world of forgery and counterfeiting for an unassuming career as a freelance consultant. Now her world is a small farm in the French Pyrenees, with daily fresh eggs and the companionship of her devoted dog.But when U.S. intelligence operative John Valsamis shows up at her door, Nicole is reminded that she\u2019ll always be an ex-con. Valsamis is after Nicole\u2019s former lover, Rahim Ali, and soon Nicole finds herself back in Lisbon, tracking down Rahim in all their old haunts. Except now Rahim isn\u2019t just a document forger\u2013he\u2019s a suspected terrorist. Unwittingly drawn into an international web of fundamentalism, crime, and corruption, Nicole discovers that its threads stretch from the cobbled streets of Lisbon to the once-beautiful city of her birth, Beirut, and to the top levels of the government that sent Valsamis to find her. And as with any good web, the harder Nicole fights to free herself, the tighter it closes around her. \u201cThought-provoking . . . The gritty atmosphere is perfectly drawn, and complex layers of lies and betrayal keep the reader happily guessing up to the end.\u201d\u2013Publishers Weekly\u201cChilling and utterly believable, An Accidental American hurls the reader into the dark and forbidding world of espionage. Not to be missed.\u201d\u2013Gayle Lynds, author of The Last Spymaster______________________________________________________________THE MORTALIS DOSSIER- ALEX CARR\u2019S NOTE ON THE BOMBING OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN BEIRUTOn April 18, 1983, at one o\u2019clock in the afternoon, a van carrying twothousand pounds of explosives blew up outside the American embassyin Beirut, killing sixty-three people. Among the victims wereseventeen Americans, eight of whom represented the Central IntelligenceAgency\u2019s entire Middle East contingent. In the years precedingthe bombing, an increasing number of attacks on Western andIsraeli interests had been carried out by Palestinian and Muslim extremists,but the Beirut bombing was widely seen as a watershedevent for American policies in the region. With the exception of theseizure of the American embassy in Tehran four years earlier, an actthat was carried out within the framework of Iran\u2019s Islamic revolution,the embassy bombing represented the first time America hadbeen so directly and bloodily targeted by Islamic terrorists for its militaryinvolvement in the Middle East.It\u2019s impossible to see why the United States was such an unwelcomeforce without an understanding of the history of Lebanon andthe surrounding region, and of American and Western involvementin the politics of the Middle East in general. Though Lebanon hasexisted in one form or another since the ninth century b.c., the moderncountry of Lebanon was not established until 1920, when it wasgranted to the French as part of a system of mandates established forthe administration of former Turkish and German territories followingWorld War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. In fact, almostall of what we think of as the modern Middle East was shapedby these mandates.America\u2019s first direct intervention in Lebanese politics came in1946. During World War II, Lebanon had been declared a free statein order to liberate it from Vichy control. But when, after the war,Lebanon eventually moved toward full independence, the Frenchbalked, and the United States, Britain, and several Arab governmentsstepped in to support Lebanese independence. It was at this timethat Lebanon\u2019s system of political power sharing was devised. Wellaware of the country\u2019s shaky precolonial past and determined to keepLebanon intact, the fledgling nationalist government agreed to splitpower along sectarian lines, based on the numbers of the 1932 census.It was a well-intentioned plan, but one that inadvertently set thestage for decades of strife and civil war.The power-sharing government\u2019s first major stumbling block camewith the partitioning of the British Mandate of Palestine in the wakeof World War II, and the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed. Theensuing influx of some 100,000 Palestinian refugees into Lebanonproved a strain on the carefully crafted power-sharing system. Tensionswere further exacerbated in 1956, when Egyptian presidentGamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, provoking theUnited States, along with Britain, France, and Israel, to respond withmilitary force. While Lebanese Muslims wanted the government toback the newly created United Arab Republic, Christians fought tokeep the nation allied with the West. In 1958, with the country teeteringon the brink of civil war, the United States sent marines intoLebanon to support the government of President Camille Chamoun,thus inextricably linking itself with Christian forces.It was an alliance that would be tested when, nearly two decadeslater, sectarian rivalries finally erupted into full-scale civil war. WhileLebanon had enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity, tensionsbetween the United States and the Soviet Union, and betweenthe United States and Iran, had escalated significantly, as had tensionsbetween the Israelis and the Palestinians. By the spring of1975\u2013when gunmen from the Christian Phalange militia attacked abus in the suburbs of Beirut and massacred twenty-seven Palestinianson board in what is widely agreed to have been the first act of thecivil war\u2013the forces at work in Lebanon were not merely internalones. The Cold War, as well as the larger Arab-Israeli conflict, wereboth being played out in Lebanon, and would be throughout thecourse of the war, as international players funneled weapons andmoney to the various Christian, Muslim, and Druze militias.The United States was a major player in the civil war from the beginning,providing mainly covert support for the Christian government,with whom it had traditionally been allied. But it wasn\u2019t until1982, after the Israeli siege of Beirut, the assassination of Phalangeleader Bachir Gemayel, and the horrific massacres at the Palestinianrefugee camps of Sabra and Shatila, that U.S. troops, along withother members of a multinational peacekeeping force, formally intervenedin the conflict. The United Nations\u2014backed coalition wasmeant as a neutral presence, but the complications of Cold War allegiancesand the United States\u2019 traditionally close ties to Israel andLebanon\u2019s Christian government meant that the Americans were inevitablyviewed by Muslim and Druze factions as anything but impartial.It was in this environment, less than six months after theAmericans arrived as peacekeepers, that the embassy bombing tookplace.There can be no doubt that the main goal of the bombing was tointimidate the United States into pulling its forces from Lebanon.But there were other, less obvious but no less significant reasons behindthe attack. Responsibility for the bombing, and the subsequentbombing of the marine barracks, was claimed by a radical wing of theIranian-backed Hezbollah. In the years leading up to these attacks,Iran had taken an increasingly aggressive role in its support ofLebanese Muslim militias, most of which were traditionally Shiite,transforming what had once been a mainly political fight into a religiousand moral one. Not only did Muslim radicals want Americantroops gone, but they wanted to rid the country of Western culturalinfluence\u2013which they saw as mainly American\u2013as well. In thebloody years to follow, the American University of Beirut, as well asAmerican and Western journalists, would be targets of a concertedcampaign of kidnapping and intimidation.Under any other circumstances, the Islamicizing of the conflictmight have been yet another disturbing development in an alreadywildly fractured situation. But in the hothouse of the Lebanese civilwar, Hezbollah\u2019s fierce brand of anti-Americanism became not just aShia or Iranian cause but a Palestinian and therefore pan-Arab causeas well. In the years since the embassy bombing, the cause has takenon many faces, including that of the vast al-Qaeda network, but theanger remains undiluted. Not only is anti-American thinking stillprevalent today in the Middle East, but it has become the unitingforce for radical Muslims the world over.Former high-ranking members of the Reagan administration haveconfirmed that how to respond to the embassy bombing and thebombing of the marine barracks was a subject of debate at the time.There was a clear split within the White House between those whobelieved that force was the best response and those who argued thatthe use of military power would only add to the problem by antagonizingAmerica\u2019s remaining friends in the Arab world. The lessons ofVietnam, along with the horrific loss of life in both attacks, no doubthelped cement the decision to follow a policy of disengagement. Inthe end, the choice was made to pull all American troops out ofLebanon.It\u2019s no coincidence that I chose to make the 1983 bombing of theAmerican embassy in Beirut central to the plot of An AccidentalAmerican. This is a novel about U.S. involvement in the politics ofthe Middle East, and the embassy bombing has shaped Americanpolicy in that region as few other events have. Disengagement is nolonger the United States\u2019 response of choice when dealing with Islamicextremism. In light of the September 11 attacks, it comes as nosurprise that American foreign policy leans heavily on the swift useof military might. But the effects of the decisions made in the wakeof the Beirut bombings are also at the root of this powerful policyshift. Those in Washington who argue in favor of unilateral militaryaction can point to the message that the earlier withdrawal sent:namely, that the United States could be intimidated by terrorists.Writing about events in which real people lost their lives is alwaysa delicate undertaking. Sixty-three people were killed in the embassybombing, and it is not my intention to dishonor them. While I do aimfor historical accuracy, my main focus as a writer is on my characters.Truthfulness for me means looking back on the events of historythrough the flawed lens of human perception. This means creatingcharacters who are as real as possible, and whose motives are oftenless than pure and always complicated. I strongly believe that I canbest respect the real inhabitants of history by struggling to portray myfictional inhabitants as honestly as possible.Most of my fictionalization of the embassy bombing in An AccidentalAmerican adheres closely to the facts. The van used to transportthe explosives to the embassy had, in fact, been stolen from theembassy pool the summer before the bombing. It is universally acknowledgedthat the Syrians, as well as the Iranians under the guiseof Hezbollah, were behind the attacks. Among the people killed thatday were the CIA\u2019s chief Middle East analyst, Robert C. Ames, andstation chief Kenneth Haas. Both Ames and Haas were brilliant menand rising stars, and the consequences of their deaths are still beingfelt within the intelligence community. But the idea that a rogue CIAofficial was actually behind the bombing is entirely fabricated, as areall the characters involved.In recent years, there seems to be a growing uncertainty concerningwhat, exactly, separates fiction from nonfiction. The meteoric riseof the memoir and other forms of \u201ccreative nonfiction\u201d has furtherblurred an already fuzzy line between minor embellishment and outrightfabrication\u2013while the popularity of a certain kind of fiction,which claims to illuminate long-concealed truths, has led readers toconfuse clever fabrication with fact. In the wake of this uncertaintyhas come outrage and even anger. I have to admit, I don\u2019t see what allthe fuss is about. Stories are meant to transport\u2013at its best, historicalfiction can even offer us a wise perspective on our own condition\u2013and if readers are denied the joy of suspending their disbelief,they might as well not read at all.This doesn\u2019t mean, however, that we should substitute thewatered-down truths of historical fiction for the real thing, or themusings of a fiction writer, whose ultimate loyalty lies with his or herstory, for the more measured presentations of historians and journalists,whose allegiances are with the truth. We live in a world in whichthe costs of ignorance are simply too high.",

We join him on covert trips to labor camps and to the hospitals where organs of executed prisoners sell for top dollar, witness the emotionally wrenching pilgrimages to the graves of persecuted friends and family, and, finally, brave the long months before his arrest when he feared the Chinese government might once and for all make a martyr of their number one troublemaker.",

        "Title": "Bad Press: The Worst Critical Reviews Ever!",
        "Authors": "By Ward, Laura",
        "Description": "Here's a ferociously funny glimpse into the history of literary, theater, art, and general entertainment criticism. Excerpts of reviews are taken from magazines, newspapers, and, in at least one case, from the lips of a powerful European emperor. A complimentary review of most books, music recordings, or plays will often inspire audiences to accept them, but the review is usually forgotten while the work of art goes on to become famous. Readers won't find such reviews in this book, because the emphasis here is on fun. For sheer glee there is nothing like seeing a really venomous critic sharpen his or her claws on somebody's masterpiece. Sometimes the critics are right, but just as often they take journalistic pratfalls. Like many other Hapsburg Emperors who ruled the vast AustroHungarian Empire from its Vienna capital, Joseph II was a generous patron of the arts. But when he dismissed a Mozart symphony as \"having too many notes,\" the rest of the music world could only smile. Henry James and Mark Twain were contemporary novelists, but neither writer understood or appreciated the other's genius. Twain once said of James: \"Once you put down one of his books, you simply can't pick it up again.\" More scathing was the famous New Yorker magazine critic Dorothy Parker, who said of one now-forgotten book: \"This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.\" Readers will chuckle as they read damning reviews of books, music, plays, television shows, movies, and even restaurants. It's pure entertainment, with just a drop or two of poison.",

Dirt poor, living in a trailer with her Aunt June and Uncle Roosevelt behind a gas station in a tumbleweedy Texas town, and pregnant with an illegitimate child, Billy knows that treasure could mean salvation. So she steals Dill\u2019s pickup truck and, with her aunt and uncle in tow, heads for Arizona with Dill in hot pursuit. While everyone agrees it\u2019s only polite to speak of getting mother\u2019s body and moving her to a proper resting place, it\u2019s well understood that digging up Willa Mae\u2019s diamonds and pearls will make the whole trip a lot more worthwhile.The enormously accomplished fiction debut from Suzan-Lori Parks, the 2002 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Getting Mother\u2019s Body takes its place in the company of the classic works of Zora Neale Hurston and Alice Walker. But when it comes to an ingenious, uproarious knack for depicting the trifling, hard-luck, down-and-out souls who need a little singing and laughing and lying and praying to get through the day, Suzan-Lori Parks shares the stage with no one.",

        "Description": "Two physicians unveil a revolutionary, accessible, science-based, patient-centered program for living an active, age-defying, disease-free life.  Healthcare is pulled and shaped by many forces, by drug and insurance companies looking for profits, by politicians in search of votes, and by stressed, overworked physicians who barely have time to talk to you before writing a prescription or packing you off to a specialist.  So is anyone interested in keeping you well?  Yes. Created by two physicians who both survived catastrophic illness, the Ultraprevention program will work for absolutely everyone -- old, young, healthy, sick, or somewhere in between. The promise of its practice is huge -- a health span that matches life span -- and you'll experience increased energy, weight loss, enhanced mood and memory, better digestion, deeper sleep, diminished stress, and more.  Ultraprevention is the new science of staying healthy, an innovative program that shatters the myths of today's \"fix-the-broken-parts\" medicine. These myths -- drugs cure disease, genes determine your fate, getting older means aging, fat is a four-letter word -- are actually believed by many doctors and are keeping you sick.  Ardent general practitioners, Drs. Hyman and Liponis reject the current healthcare system of specialists paid to find something wrong, specialists who don't consider how their \"cure\" for one ailment affects the entire body.  Working outside the managed care model at Canyon Ranch in the Berkshires, Hyman and Liponis break free of the vicious quick-fix prescription cycle and formulate a program that identifies and eliminates the cause of disease instead of just masking symptoms.  Isolating the source of more than 90 percent of today's most common diseases, from cancer and heart disease to diabetes, stroke, and Alzheimer's, they enumerate the Five Forces of Illness -- Sludge (malnutrition), Burnout (impaired metabolism), Heat (inflammation), Waste (impaired detoxification), and Rust (oxidative stress). Through the practice of the six-week Ultraprevention program, you'll learn three simple steps -- each only two weeks long -- that stop these forces and create a lifetime of good health by removing allergens, infections, and toxins from the body and environment; repairing the body through personalizing nutrition, boosting the immune system, and balancing hormones; and recharging with stress management, sleep restoration, and gentle movement.  So stop falling for the myths that make you sick and start Ultraprevention, the powerful plan to get older without aging, to maintain health for all of life.",
