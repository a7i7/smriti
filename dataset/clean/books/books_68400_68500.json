Jason Anthony describes the challenges of everyday life in Vostok, the coldest place on earth, where temperatures dip as low as minus-129 degrees and where, in midsummer, minus-20 degrees is considered a heat wave.David Halberstam, in one of his last published essays, recalls how an inauspicious Saigon restaurant changed the way he and other reporters in Vietnam saw the world. Ian Frazier analyzes why we get sick when traveling in out-of-the-way places. And Kevin Fedarko embarks on a drug-fueled journey in Djibouti, chewing psychotropic foliage in \u201cthe worst place on earth.\u201dCloser to home, Steve Friedman profiles a 410-pound man who set out to walk cross-country to lose weight and find happiness.

The new technology of the positronic pathway is a quantum leap in the field of artificial intelligence, but it's hardly an exact science. Aberrations occur. Aberrations like Andrew, a most extraordinary robot who, it seems, is capable of creating, learning, adapting, and even feeling. Andrew is the first robot of his kind, and also the last, for when U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc., learns of his talents, they terminate this entire line, terrified by its implications.But Andrew's owners, the Martins, refuse to give him up. They love their robot; he is a cherished member of the family, and a valuable one - sales of the furniture he creates are phenomenal. Andrew is fond of the Martins too, even beyond the minimum standards ensured by the Three Laws of Robotics that are hardwired into his circuits. He has it easy as robots go, but something gnaws at him, something that moves him to risk everything he has in an impossible struggle for his freedom. With quiet dignity, Andrew faced down the all-too-familiar forces of bigotry and hatred in a daring bid to obtain the only thing that really matters to him ... his humanity.Written with incomparable strength, wit, and beauty, The Positronic Man is a brilliant novel of science fiction, and a fable for our time.",

Is it even possible to imagine?New York Times bestselling author Luanne Rice explores the complex emotional equations of love and loyalty that hold together three pairs of remarkable sisters. Here in the halls of Newport Academy, a unique private school that has attracted generations of rebels, outcasts, and visionaries, an unforgettable lesson in the eternal truths of sisterhood is about to begin\u2026.After years away, Maura Shaw has returned to Newport, Rhode Island, to teach English at the academy. Behind her lies her life as the perfect Midwestern wife and mother, a life that seemed on the surface to be all she had ever wished for. That illusion vanished in a storm off Mackinac Island in the wake of an accident that engulfed Maura\u2019s husband and her older daughter, Carrie. Now, with her son and younger daughter, she hopes to find a new beginning. Newport has never failed to infuse Maura with a sense of mystery and hope. But for fourteen-year-old Beck, the move is a painful upheaval from everything she has ever loved\u2014especially her sister, Carrie. Ever since her sister disappeared, Beck has retreated into the world of mathematics, where principles are permanent, unlike so many other things in life. Without Carrie, Beck has lost half of herself\u2014the half that would have fit in at the elite private school she and her brother, Travis, will now attend. The half that made things right. Still, Beck clings to the hope that her sister will return to them. Beck isn\u2019t alone in her struggle to adjust. At sixteen, Travis is juggling a long-distance first love and an attraction to an expensive-looking girl with a wicked sparkle in her eye. And for Maura, ghosts linger here\u2014an unresolved breach with her own beloved sister and a long-ago secret that may now have the power to set her free\u2026. Set against the breathtaking beauty of the New England coast at its most dramatic, populated by a cast of indelible characters, The Geometry of Sisters is Luanne Rice at her most compelling, a dazzling world to which readers will want to return again and again.",

Ranging across countries and cultures, the selection includes a number of new stories from the Pacific Rim.Well-known writers\u2014William Maxwell, Margaret Atwood, Don DeLillo, Mark Richard\u2014join lesser-known writers\u2014Molly Giles, Andrew Lam, Judy Troy\u2014who will be (or should be) better known.

        "Description": "This seminal work on modern terrorism is the one book to read in order to truly understand the reasons why radical Muslims such as Osama bin Laden and his followers have declared war on America and the West. In order to win the war against terrorism, argues Michael Scheuer, former head of the CIA\u2019s Bin Laden Unit, we must first stop dismissing militant Muslims as \"extremists\" or \"religious fanatics.\" Formulating a successful military strategy requires that we see the enemy as they perceive themselvehighly trained and motivated soldiers who believe their cause is righteous.This revised paperback edition provides a more extensive study of Osama bin Laden and the sources of his thought. Scheuer has added a good deal of bin Laden\u2019s words, focusing on those issues that have been most misunderstood or ignored and therefore are most in need of exposition. These include bin Laden\u2019s personality; his early years as a nonviolent Saudi dissident and reformer; the causes motivating al Qaeda and its allies, especially their perception that U.S. foreign policy threatens Islam\u2019s survival; bin Laden\u2019s long history of interest in and support for the Palestinian cause against Israel; his evolutionary growth as an Islamic hero and leader between 1996 and 2001; and the profound impact the Afghan-Soviet War had and continues to have on bin Laden, al Qaeda, and worldwide Sunni Islamic militancy. Only by understanding these words can the West appreciate the threat it faces and formulate a strategy to defeat it.",

He is a courageous eater, save brussels sprouts. His knowledge of wine is vague and best defined as Napa, good; Australian, better; French, better still. Kir royale is his drink of occasion. For an Englishman he makes a poor cup of tea. He believes women are quantifiably wiser than men, and would never give Zipper the slightest reason to mistrust him or question his love. Zipper simply describes Ambrose as the only man she has ever loved. Without adjustment.Then, just as he is turning fifty, Ambrose is told by his doctor that he has one month to live. Reeling from the news, he and Zipper embark on a whirlwind expedition to the places he has most loved or has always longed to visit, from A to Z, Amsterdam to Zanzibar. As they travel to Italian piazzas, Turkish baths, and other romantic destinations, all beautifully evoked by the author, Zipper struggles to deal with the grand unfairness of their circumstances as she buoys Ambrose with her gentle affection and humor. Meanwhile, Ambrose reflects on his life, one well lived, and comes to understand that death, like life, will be made bearable by the strength and grace of their devotion.Richardson\u2019s lovely prose comes alive with an honesty and intensity that will leave you breathless and inspired by the simple beauty and power of love.The End of the Alphabet is a timeless, resonant exploration of the nature of love, loss, and life.",

He uncovers a story about Saudi Arabia\u2019s troubled oil industry, not to mention its political and societal instability, which differs sharply from the globally accepted Saudi version. It\u2019s a story that is provocative and disturbing, based on undeniable facts, but until now never told in its entirety. Twilight in the Desert answers all readers\u2019 questions about Saudi oil and production industries with keen examination instead of unsubstantiated posturing, and takes its place as one of the most important books of this still-young century.",

        "Description": "Our Worst Nightmare\u2014and How to Avoid ItIt\u2019s the ultimate nightmare scenario for conservatives: to awaken on the morning of November 5, 2008, to the news that the last swing state has been colored bright blue and Hillary Rodham Clinton is the President-elect of the United States. Could it really happen?Frighteningly, yes. In fact, as bestselling author and leading conservative commentator John Podhoretz reveals, this is not just a scary \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario; it will happen . . . unless conservatives take immediate action. Sounding the alarm bell with wit and verve, Can She Be Stopped? shows that Hillary\u2019s plan to capture the White House is much further along than her enemies fear. Podhoretz uncovers the host of reasons why\u2014many of them counterintuitive. He also destroys the comfortable myths about Clinton that conservatives cling to: She\u2019s saddled with too many \u201chigh negatives.\u201d She\u2019s too liberal to get elected. \u201cClinton fatigue\u201d will keep her out of the Oval Office. You\u2019ve heard them all, and they\u2019re wrong on every count. After shaking Republicans out of their complacency, Podhoretz lays out the precise strategy  conservatives must deploy to stop Hillary dead in her tracks. His groundbreaking ten-point plan of action reveals:\u2022  How to expose the real, ultraliberal Hillary\u2022  How to \"smoke her out\" and prevent her from hiding on key issues \u2022  How to make her denounce popular Republican programs\u2014and defend unpopular liberal ideas\u2022  How to use her Senate seat as a weapon against her\u2022  How to overcome the Republican Party\u2019s own problems\u2022  Whom the Republicans should nominate (and the choice may surprise you)Conservatives can\u2019t avoid the Hillary problem any longer, or else the nation will be forced to endure another Clinton in the White House. Fortunately, John Podhoretz is here with the detailed blueprint that will spare the country from that disastrous turn of events, in a book as puckishly lively as it is sobering. Can she be stopped? Yes\u2014but only if we get to work . . . now.",

        "Description": "The evidence is irrefutable: global warming is real. While the debate continues about just how much damage spiking temperatures will wreak, we know the threat to our homes, health, and even way of life is dire. So why isn\u2019             t America doing anything? Where is the national campaign to stop this catastrophe?\u00a0It may lie between the covers of this book. Ignition brings together some of the world\u2019             s finest thinkers and advocates to jump start the ultimate green revolution. Including celebrated writers like Bill McKibben and renowned scholars like Gus Speth, as well as young activists, the authors draw on direct experience in grassroots organization, education, law, and social leadership. Their approaches are various, from building coalitions to win political battles to rallying shareholders to change corporate behavior. But they share a belief that private fears about deadly heat waves and disastrous hurricanes can translate into powerful public action.\u00a0For anyone who feels compelled to do more than change their light bulbs or occasionally carpool, Ignition is an essential guide. Combining incisive essays with success stories and web resources, the book helps readers answer the most important question we all face: \u201c             What can I do?\u201d",

        "Authors": "By Zinn, Howard (FRW) and Chang, Nancy",
        "Description": "In her groundbreaking new book, Silencing Political Dissent, constitutional expert Nancy Chang examines how the Bush administration's fight against terrorism is resulting in a disturbing erosion of First Amendment rights and increase of executive power.Chang's compelling analysis begins with a historical review of political repression and intolerance of dissent in America. From the Sedition Act of 1798, through the Smith Act of the 1940s and the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II, to the FBI's infamous COINTELPRO program of the 1960s, Chang recalls how during times of crisis and war, the U.S. government has unjustly detained individuals, invaded personal privacy, and hampered the free speech of Americans.Chang's expertise as a senior constitutional attorney shines through in the power and clarity of her argument. Meticulously researched and footnoted, Chang's book forces us to challenge the government when it is unpopular to do so, and to consider that perhaps \"our future safety lies in the expansion, rather the contraction, of the democratic values set forth in the Constitution.\"",
