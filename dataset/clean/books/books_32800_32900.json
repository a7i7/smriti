        "Description": "It Happened one night, suddenly, without warning: 90% of the human race disappeared without a trace. Vanished, never to be seen again. There were no portents, no notes, no bodies, no clue as to where they went or whether they would ever come back again. People woke to find their lovers no longer beside them. Children woke to find their parents missing, parents woke to empty cribs. Neighbors found empty houses, empty apartment buildings.Civilization collapsed.After a few months of violence spawned by fear and rage, a measure of peace was restored in the Bay Area. Enclaves formed and established defense pacts against the wandering bands of fanatics. They set about surviving, renewing contact with the rest of the world, establishing trading ties with each other, and trying to discover what had caused the Vanishing.Now, thirty years after the Disappearance, Dr. Easterman is coming across the continent from the Carnegie Institute to work with the Hackers Center in Silicon Valley, continuing a promising line of research on what caused the cataclysmic event. At the House, where a community of survivors has made a good life while continuing to build the Winchester Mansion, a young woman named Renzie is in the middle of the political struggles between various groups in the Valley.And up in the Oakland Hills a huge band of Heaven Bounders is gathering. The 'Bounders believe that the Vanishing was Judgement Day, and the Vanished have ascended to heaven. They believe that the only thing holding back their own salvation is the disbelief of others - disbelief that is manifested in building houses and growing food. If those others were dead, the Heaven Bounders believe, then Judgement would be fulfilled, and they would join their loved ones in Heaven.",

We are     high school graduates. We have bachelor degrees, masters and Ph.D. degrees.     We work well below our level of capability. We work at the top level of corporations     and government.  We are women who have experienced abortion.  We have a secret we cannot share. If people knew the truth about us they would     not like us, love us, or associate with us. We have committed a sin so horrendous     we believe it is unforgivable.  The unforgivable sin. The sin we carry inside our hearts. The sin we believe     stamps a scarlet letter A on our forehead and soul. . . .  Society is not going to punish us. We punish ourselves with self-destructive     habits: drugs, alcohol, eating disorders, sexual dysfunctions, suicide attempts     or completions, abusive relationships.  Years later something snaps and we can no longer bear the burden of our sin.     We confess. Perhaps tentatively, carefully, cautiously, discreetly, prudently     to a friend, a loved one, a boyfriend or a husband. The pain, the pain . . .      In Her Choice to Heal, you will find women who have lived with that pain and     found help, healing, and hope. They have learned they can recover from their     abortions and even find peace.  Perhaps you have experienced abortion, perhaps you want to help a friend or     loved one heal from the pain of abortion, or perhaps you want to better understand     this issue. I encourage you to read Her Choice to Heal and recognize there is     hope in the recovery process when we understand and recognize the loss of our     child, perhaps name that child and mourn, grieve that loss, and accept God?s     forgiveness. Then we are free to forgive ourselves and go on to the hope Christ     offered on the cross and still offers today.  My friends, we have all been touched by abortion in some way. As you read,     ask the Lord how He wants to use this book in your life.       Carol Everett    President    Life Network",

By sensitizing us to subtleties of speech we may never have considered before, he shows us how to turn every exchange into an opportunity.Remarkable for its clarity and practicality, Words That Hurt, Words That Heal illuminates the powerful effects we create by what we say and how we say it.",

        "Authors": "By Mapes, Mary",
        "Description": "It was a great story. A true story. The kind of story any news producer would love to report, nail down and get on the air. And that\u2019s just what Mary Mapes and her producing and reporting team did in September, 2004, when Dan Rather anchored their report on President George W. Bush\u2019s dereliction of his National Guard duty for CBS News. The firestorm that followed their broadcast trashed Mapes\u2019 well-respected career, caused Rather to resign from his anchor chair a year early, and led to an unprecedented \u201cinternal inquiry\u201d into the story\u2014chaired by former Reagan Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.TRUTH AND DUTY is Mapes\u2019 account of the often-surreal, always-harrowing fallout she experienced for raising questions about a powerful sitting president. It goes back to examine Bush\u2019s political roots as governor of Texas and answers questions about the solidity of the documents at the heart of the National Guard story as well as where they came from. Her book takes readers not just into the newsroom where coverage decisions are made, but out into the field where the real reporting is done. TRUTH AND DUTY is peopled with a colorful and vigorous cast of characters\u2014from Karl Rove to Sumner Redstone, Bill Burkett to Dan Rather\u2014and moves from small-town rural Texas to the deserts of Afghanistan, from hurricane season in Florida to CBS corporate headquarters Black Rock in New York City.TRUTH AND DUTY is a riveting account of how the public\u2019s right to know\u2014or even to ask questions\u2014is being attacked by an alliance of politicians, news organizations, bloggers and corporate America. It connects the dots between the emergence of a kind of digital McCarthyism, a corporation under fire from the federal government, and the decision about what kinds of stories a news network can cover (human interest: yes; political intrigue: no). An answer to Bernard Goldberg and the thunder from the right, TRUTH AND DUTY is always fast, sometimes furious, and often unexpectedly funny about the collapse of one of America\u2019s great institutions.",

A large body of increasingly compelling scientific evidence is telling us that many things we do -- from the kinds of cars we drive to how we heat our homes -- are directly affecting our global climate in unprecedented and alarming ways. But what can any one person do about this vast, global problem? Help fix it!

A how-to home improvement guide for the planet, the book: describes the problem of global warming today as well as its likely effects in the future considers the sources of energy available to us, and explains why one of them is the Earth's best hope offers dozens of ways to painlessly reduce your own energy use provides action steps to affect the world's energy use and help change policy tells where to go for further help and more information The first Earth Day in 1970 helped launch the modern environmental movement. Rather than waiting for elected officials to take action to address environmental abuses, environmental maverick Denis Hayes and his compatriots took the lead in bringing the subject to the forefront of American consciousness. Through three decades, the idea of Earth Day has flourished, and now more than ever, individuals need to take matters into their own hands and create change from the ground up and from the whole earth down. As citizens and consumers, we hold a vast capacity for improving our environment and leaving a bright legacy for our children.

Lennox, a travel writer and adventurer, has become fascinated by the secretive golden-skinned natives of Medina, called Fireflies by the Human Republic. But on his first visit he was caught by the Fireflies' high priest while attempting to spy on a sacred ritual in a village forbidden to all foreigners. He was tortured and nearly killed before being left as a warning to other curious Men.Now Lennox is determined to find out what it is that the aliens want so much to hide. He will return to Medina, and this time he will attempt to discover their secrets from inside their culture, instead of outside. Lennox employs the latest medical breakthroughs to alter his body to resemble a Firefly. He immerses himself in the dialect of a city of Medina distant from the sacred village. He studies what is known of the Fireflies' culture and history, though that knowledge is dangerously limited.And then he arranges to be dropped back on Medina, in the wasteland between cities, to make his slow way toward the sacred village. If he survives the journey, he thinks he will have learned enough to safely pass the gates of the temple precincts.",

We can take charge of change instead of fearing it, says Candice Carpenter, by living serially, chapter by chapter, focusing our efforts\u00ad\u00adand reaping our rewards\u00ad\u00adone chapter at a time. Both a bold new metaphor and a practical plan for success, Chapters has profound implications for career and business decision-making and for marking the milestones in our personal lives. It reveals an entirely new way to think about change and a refreshingly innovative\u00ad\u00adand workable\u00ad\u00adframework for managing it. We can, for example, use one chapter in our lives to acquire status and responsibility, another to acquire wealth, another to focus on our children, and others to learn new skills, serve our communities, and make our mark on the world. With each new chapter, we can cultivate the wavelike quality of internal fluidity needed for every personal reinvention, and we can reach that heightened level of exhilaration and achievement Carpenter calls the \"Zone.\" An accomplished change master herself, Carpenter draws upon her own remarkable experiences and the lives of dozens of other people interviewed for this book. Chapters propels us ahead of the change curve toward sustained professional and personal success, satisfaction in our accomplishments, and balance over a lifetime. In Chapters readers learn how to:  Embrace change rather than fear it  Know when it's time to start a new life chapter  Plan ahead for major changes Handle false starts and failure  Master change and achieve true professional and personal success",

A constant reader and a straight-A student, nevertheless Dickerson's lack of confidence kept her from accepting the many colleges offers she received. Instead she enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, quickly rising through the ranks. In spite of her success, she recognized within herself deep-seated conflict at being a working class black woman living in a white man's world. Her path to self-acceptance is at the heart of this refreshing narrative.",

That search takes him to the immigrant and literary bohemias of 1950s London, to a facile and unsatisfying career as a writer, and at last to a decaying Portugese colony in East Africa, where he finds a happiness he will then be compelled to betray.

        "Authors": "By Badillo, Herman",
        "Description": "Why aren\u2019t Hispanics succeeding like Asians, Jews, and other immigrant groups in America? Herman Badillo's answer is as politically incorrect as the question: Hispanics simply don\u2019t put the same emphasis on education as other immigrant groups.   As the nation\u2019s first Puerto Rican?born U.S. congressman, the trailblazing Badillo once supported bilingual education and other government programs he thought would help the Hispanic community. But he came to see that the real path to prosperity, political unity, and the American mainstream is self-reliance, not big government. Now Badillo is a champion of one standard of achievement for all races and ethnicities.   In this surprising and controversial manifesto, you will learn:         Why Hispanic culture\u2019s trouble with education, democracy, and economics stems from Mother Spain and the ?five-hundred year siesta\u201d she induced in Latin America.        Why the Congressman who drafted the first Spanish-English bilingual education legislation now believes that bilingual education hurts students more than it helps.        Why ?social promotion\u201d ? putting minority students\u2019 self-esteem ahead of their academic performance and then admitting them to college unprepared ? continues to this day, despite the system\u2019s documented failures and injustices.        How self-identifying as ?Hispanic\u201d or ?white\u201d or ?black\u201d undermines achievement, and what lessons we can learn from Latin American countries, where one\u2019s race is irrelevant.  With Central and Latin America exporting a large portion of their poor, Hispanics are on the way to becoming a majority in the United States... but one with all the problems of a minority culture. Badillo\u2019s solution to this problem relies on traditional values: hard work, education, and achievement. His lessons are important not only for Hispanics but for every American.",

        "Description": "A panorama of war and love in which freedom of conscience is an idea worth dying for. Roger Williams, through whose eyes this great novel is told, was the most compelling figure in colonial America. Plucked from obscurity to clerk for the celebrated English jurist Sir Edward Coke, Williams had a ringside seat on the brutal politics of Jacobean London. He was witness to the pomp of the Star Chamber, to the burning of a dissenter, to the humiliation of his master by King James and his favorite, the dangerously beautiful Buckingham. Haunted by ambition and by love for a woman above his station, he fled to New England, where repression and conformity wore different clothes. Mary Lee Settle's arresting novel layers the approaching civil war in England with the emergence of a new order in Rhode Island, the first colony anywhere grounded on freedom of conscience. Banished by his fellow colonists in the dead of winter, Williams endured years of exile among the Narragansett Indians, and narrates this tumultuous tale in the peaceful last years of his life. To him we owe the gift of our political freedom, and to Mary Lee Settle, our most distinguished historical novelist, the gift of this book.",

The paintings are more expressive than photographs because they compress many experiences into a single view. Charts and maps clarify particular scenes, and first-hand testimonies of the men and women who participated in the battles add an extra dimension. The many oversize reproductions highlight some of the most moving paintings and illustrations ever created in the field of combat art, most made available to the public for the first time.

        "Title": "Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust",
        "Authors": "By Goldhagen, Daniel Jonah",
        "Description": "Daniel Jonah Goldhagen has revisited a question that history has come to treat as settled, and his researchers have led him to the inescapable conclusion that none of the established answers holds true. That question is: \"How could the Holocaust happen?\" His own response is a new exploration of those who carried out the Holocaust and of German society and its ingrained anti-semitism - and it demands a fundamental revision of our thinking about the years 1933-1945.Drawing principally on materials either unexplored or neglected by previous scholars, Goldhagen marshals new, disquieting, primary evidence - including extensive testimony from the actual perpetrators themselves - to show that many beliefs about the killers are fallacies: They were not primarily SS men or Nazi Party members, but perfectly ordinary Germans from all walks of life, men (and women) who brutalized and murdered Jews both willingly and zealously. And they did so, moreover, not because they were coerced (for, as he shows irrefutably, so many were informed by their own commanders that they could refuse to kill without fear of retribution)...not because they slavishly followed orders (a view seemingly supported by Stanley Milgram's famous Yale \"obedience experiment\")...not because of any tremendous social, psychological, or peer pressure to conform to the behaviour of their comrades (for no such evidence exists)...and not for any reasons associated with Hannah Arendt's disputed notion of the \"banality of evil.\" They acted as they did because of a widespread, profound, unquestioned, and virulent antisemitism that led them to regard the Jews as a demonic enemy whose extermination was not only necessary but also just. Again and again, it is the killers' own words that give us a portrait, both shocking and immediate, of their world: the organization of their daily lives, how they did what they did, their reactions to it, even their recreations in the killings fields, which included everything from sports and entertainment to the hobby of taking snapshots of their deeds and victims - to be freely exchanged and collected among themselves - leaving a devastating record of self-indictment that the author reproduces here.All of Goldhagen's documentary evidence is set within a fresh analysis of the phenomenon of German antisemitism itself, which revises many conventional views. He shows that it was already deep-rooted and pervasive in German society before Hitler came to power, and that there was a widely shared view that the Jews ought to be eliminated in some way from German society. When Hitler, ultimately, chose mass extermination as the only \"final solution,\" he was thus easily able to enlist vast numbers of Germans to carry it out.",

That is until he saw the body of his sister Annie, brutally used by a monster in human form, then carelessly discarded. He'd never seen such grief ravage the face of his friend and brother-in-law Ray Cruz, a good cop on the Newport Beach Police Department.

        "Title": "The Best Life Diet",
        "Authors": "By Greene, Bob",
        "Description": "From the bestselling author of Get With the Program! and Bob Greene's Total Body Makeover comes The Best Life Diet, a lifetime plan for losing weight and keeping it off. Bob Greene helped Oprah achieve her dramatic weight loss, and he can help you too. You'll eat the same delicious food that Oprah enjoys, and, just like Oprah, you'll have Bob to encourage you at every step. Unlike a celebrity, however, you don't need to hire a staff of experts to aid and advise you, because Bob's plan, easily tailored to an array of tastes, lifestyles, and activity levels, acts as your personal trainer and private nutritionist. Just open the book and let Bob help you get started down the path toward your best possible life.   What sets Bob apart from all the other experts who claim to have plans that work is that he admits that weight loss is difficult: seventeen years of watching people struggle to lose weight on a seemingly endless string of trendy crash diets, only to backslide and regain the pounds they've shed, have taught him that dropping pounds is not simply a numbers game. By acknowledging that it is not simple laziness but a complicated web of social rituals, cultural expectations, and habits that drives people to gain weight, Greene is able to attack the problem of weight loss realistically and offer not a short-lived, quick-fix formula, but a long-term program that accounts for the challenges and constraints of the real world.   Divided into three phases, The Best Life Diet gives you the tools you need to change your life. In each phase, you'll be asked to reexamine the decisions you make on a daily basis and gradually alter your habits to achieve lasting results. The book also includes easy-to-follow meal plans that make it simple to meet your daily energy and nutrient requirements, whether you are on the run and breakfast means a quick smoothie or you have time to shop for fresh produce and make something special.   You'll watch the weight disappear as you learn to prepare festive and flavorful dishes like Fire-Roasted Tomato-Shrimp Veracruz, Chicken Sausage Jambalaya, or Flank Steak with Chimichurri Topping and indulge in desserts like Roasted Peaches with Ricotta and Almonds or Apple Rhubarb Walnut Crisp. And for each delicious recipe, there is a detailed nutritional analysis, so you know exactly what you are eating and how it fits into your personal eating plan.   Most important, Bob's plan doesn't end once you've lost the weight. Instead, it gives you the tools you need to make living your best life second nature, because for Greene, a diet is not something you go \"on\" or \"off\" but a set of guidelines that will help you claim the life you deserve.",

Katie seems to have the ideal life: a great husband, a precocious and winning ten-year-old son, and a dream job -- writer for the long-running TV series Spy Guys. But all is not as splendid as it should be because writing about the espionage business isn't nearly as satisfying as working in it.Fifteen years earlier, Katie was in the CIA. She loved her job (to say nothing of her boss, the mysterious Benton Mattingly). Yet just as she was sensing she was in line for a promotion, she was fired -- escorted off the premises by two extremely hulking security types. Why? No one would tell her: when you're expelled from the Agency, warm friends immediately become icy ex-colleagues who won't risk their security clearances by talking to you.Until that day, Katie was where she wanted to be. Coming from a family of Manhattan superachievers, she too had a job she not only adored but a job that made her, in the family tradition, a Someone. Fifteen years later, Katie is still stuck on her firing. Was she set up? Or did she make some terrible mistake that cost lives? She believes that if she could discover why they threw her out, she might be at peace.On the day she's rushing to get her son off to summer camp, Katie gets a surprise call from former Agency colleague Lisa Golding. \"A matter of national importance,\" says Lisa, who promises to reveal the truth about the firing -- if Katie will help her. Lisa was never very good at truth-telling, though she swears she's changed her ways. Katie agrees to speak with her, but before she can, Lisa vanishes.Maturity and common sense should keep Katie in the bright, normal world of her present life, away from the dark intrigues of the past. But she needs to know. As she takes just a few steps to find out, one ex-spy who might have the answers dies under suspicious circumstances. Another former agent is murdered. Could it be there's a list? If so, is Katie now on it? And who will be the next to go?",
