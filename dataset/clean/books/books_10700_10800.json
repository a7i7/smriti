        "Description": "From the creators of WhiteHouse.org comes the guide to success, profit, and eternal salvation in Bush's Executive Branch  WhiteHouse.org, the Internet's most popular political parody, busts the Executive Mansion's elegant doors wide open to take you on a hilariously eye-popping, completely top secret tour through the most guarded-and ridiculous-people, places, prophesies, and policies of the otherwise \"on message\" world of the George W. Bush Administration. The White House Inc. Employee Handbook reveals the secret life of the White House staffer-from his introduction to senior management (Dick Cheney, commander of the Commander-in-Chief; Donald Rumsfeld, secretary of the smackdown; etc...) to the official Bush policy on hot-button issues (ex: homelessness: eliminate the glut of shelters so these people can finally live up to their name).  Equal parts shrewd business lampoon and political send-up, this is wickedly astute satire at its finest-funny and gutsy, with a frightening, yet familiar ring of that oft-forgotten thing called truth. Welcome to The White House Inc., patriotic worker bee-you picked the winning team!",

A Celtic monk's warning only heightens the peril. Is it money, power, passion, or something deeper that compels Taylor to risk everything? From Scotland's holy islands to the rugged Basque coast of Spain, from boardrooms and luxury yachts to the dungeons of America's oldest surviving fortress, the hunt is on.

A tale of redemption, in which storytelling itself is the source of salvation, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Rarely has a book so swiftly found its place on the literary landscape.And now we have \u2019Tis, the story of Frank\u2019s American journey from impoverished immigrant to brilliant teacher and raconteur. Frank lands in New York at age nineteen, in the company of a priest he meets on the boat. He gets a job at the Biltmore Hotel, where he immediately encounters the vivid hierarchies of this \u201cclassless country,\u201d and then is drafted into the army and is sent to Germany to train dogs and type reports. It is Frank\u2019s incomparable voice\u2014his uncanny humor and his astonishing ear for dialogue\u2014that renders these experiences spellbinding. When Frank returns to America in 1953, he works on the docks, always resisting what everyone tells him, that men and women who have dreamed and toiled for years to get to America should \u201cstick to their own kind\u201d once they arrive. Somehow, Frank knows that he should be getting an education, and though he left school at fourteen, he talks his way into New York University. There, he falls in love with the quintessential Yankee, long-legged and blonde, and tries to live his dream. But it is not until he starts to teach\u2014and to write\u2014that Frank finds his place in the world. The same vulnerable but invincible spirit that captured the hearts of readers in Angela\u2019s Ashes comes of age. As Malcolm Jones said in his Newsweek review of Angela\u2019s Ashes, \u201cIt is only the best storyteller who can so beguile his readers that he leaves them wanting more when he is done...and McCourt proves himself one of the very best.\u201d Frank McCourt's \u2019Tis is one of the most eagerly awaited books of our time, and it is a masterpiece.",

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\u201d So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank\u2019s mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank\u2019s father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy\u2014exasperating, irresponsible, and beguiling\u2014does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father\u2019s tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank\u2019s survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig\u2019s head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors\u2014yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance, and remarkable forgiveness. Angela\u2019s Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt\u2019s astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.",

        "Description": "After almost three years of intensive research, two superb journalists shed much light on the explosive issues that arose during the confirmation hearings: Did Thomas indeed harass Hill? How did Hill's allegations leak to the press? Why was the Senate Judiciary Committee unable to solve the mysteries surrounding the case?But as Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson show, the story of Thomas's ascension to the Court goes far beyond what emerged during the hearings. Over the course of their investigation, the authors conducted hundreds of interviews - including the first on-the-record interview with Anita Hill about her role in the controversy - and uncovered many documents that were never shared with the public. For the first time, we learn about Thomas's ten-year campaign for the high court and the doubts about him that haunted the White House from the start. We see the profound cynicism behind the administration's campaign for Thomas: its canny manipulation of the weak and scandal-ridden Senate, its quiet collaboration with the religious right, its calculated creation of \"grassroots\" black support. In the end, we learn the truth about who Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill really are and how both were treated unfairly by Washington's establishment.",

        "Title": "ACTIVE FAITH: How Christians are Changing the Face of American Politics",
        "Authors": "By Reed, Ralph",
        "Description": "Ralph Reed, Executive Director of the Christian Coalition, is responsible for wedding high technology with cutting-edge political organization to engineer the most efficient and effective projection of religion into the nation's political life in modern times. In Active Faith, Reed articulates a new \"theology\" of political activism for devout Christians and calls upon all Americans, both religious and secular, to heal our ailing body politic.With a historian's practiced eye, Reed recounts the long tale of religious involvement in American life, showing that despite the popular belief, devout Christians and religious rhetoric have been the driving force behind nearly every major social reform movement in America, whether of the right or of the left. From abolition to the New Deal, from the labor movement to civil rights, Christian believers have been instrumental to the expansion of social justice in the United States. Reed paints compelling portraits of the most famous religious reformers of the past, including William Jennings Bryan, Walter Rauschenbusch, and Martin Luther King, Jr., men whose ideas and ideals exerted a broad positive influence on the secular politics of their day.By contrast, the involvement of Christian conservatives in politics today prompts puzzlement, anger, and condescension from the media and establishment politicians. Reed explains why this is so, blaming a knee-jerk secularism that has infected many of our institutions and that makes American elites suspect any public pronouncements of religious faith, Christian or otherwise.Reed gives a detailed account of how the Christian Coalition overcame media hostility, cultural stereotypes, and the missteps of the old religious right to become a respected and permanent fixture in American politics. Today, by uniting with Catholics and observant Jews, as well as reaching out to African-Americans, it stands poised to capture majority status on hundreds of local school boards, in city councils, in state legislatures, and in the U.S. Congress itself.",

He was born in Harlem to immigrant parents from Jamaica. He knew the rough life of the streets. He overcame a barely average start at school. Then he joined the Army. The rest is history--Vietnam, the Pentagon, Panama, Desert Storm--but a history that until now has been known only on the surface. Here, for the first time, Colin Powell himself tells us how it happened, in a memoir distinguished by a heartfelt love of country and family, warm good humor, and a soldier's directness. MY AMERICAN JOURNEY is the powerful story of a life well lived and well told. It is also a view from the mountaintop of the political landscape of America. At a time when Americans feel disenchanted with their leaders, General Powell's passionate views on family, personal responsibility, and, in his own words, \"the greatness of America and the opportunities it offers\" inspire hope and present a blueprint for the future.

        "Title": "Behind Palace Doors",
        "Authors": "By Dempster, Nigel and Evans, Peter",
        "Description": "For three decades, Nigel Dempster, London's top gossip columnist, has chronicled Britain's royal family and been the confidant of several of its members. While others have speculated about the royals' loves and liaisons, their marriages, divorces, and remarriages, Dempster has heard the truth from some of the most highly placed sources in Britain. In Behind Palace Doors, he and investigative journalist Peter Evans present a through-the-keyhole story of the marital woes of the Windsors and their most celebrated members, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.Behind Palace Doors is an astonishing anatomy of what went wrong and where it will end. The union of Charles and Diana, the authors reveal, was doomed from the start. Soon after the engagement, Charles told his parents he had made a \"bloody awful\" mistake, and begged to be released, but to no avail. As the marriage faltered, he returned to an old love, Camilla Parker Bowles, whose own husband was philandering. Caught in this sorrowful triangle, Diana changed from naive young girl to angry, vengeful wife. But the major reason the marriage fell apart, we learn, was not Camilla, or even Diana's own relationships with other men, but Diana's destructive tantrums and deep hereditary depressions. In less than two years' time, Dempster has learned, she will liberate herself from the Prince of Wales and his family.As for Charles's brother Andrew, his marriage to Sarah Ferguson fared no better. Five months pregnant with their second child, she began a close friendship with Texan Steve Wyatt, and later she kept steady company with her \"financial advisor\" John Bryan. The authors provide the reasons for Sarah's reckless behavior and explain why Andrew remained tolerant for so long.In this intimate, anecdotal book, Dempster and Evans take the reader inside the private family meeting called to handle the crisis surrounding the \"Camillagate\" tapes. The authors present the reactions - including actual comments - of the Queen and Prince Philip, the manipulations of the Queen Mother, and the acid recriminations of Princess Anne. They also divulge the wrenching trauma of the Parker Bowles family and describe an extraordinary scene in which Camilla's father dresses down the Prince of Wales.Revealing, at times even shocking, Behind Palace Doors is nonetheless surprisingly sympathetic. The authors portray the British royals as spoiled, selfish, frequently wanton, yet in the end, supremely human.",

She will make his dream come true.The Understory is a magical, moving, funny, and poignant story of failure and success; of falling apart and rebuilding; and of coincidences that never really are. Part comedy, part drama, and part fairy tale, Elizabeth Leiknes\u2019s second novel is a wonder you won't soon forget.",

        "Authors": "By Beer, Edith Hahn",
        "Description": "Edith Hahn was an outspoken young woman in Vienna when the Gestapo forced her into a ghetto and then into a labor camp. When she returned home months later, she knew she would become a hunted woman and went underground. With the help of a Christian friend, she emerged in Munich as Grete Denner. There she met Werner Vetter, a Nazi Party member who fell in love with her. Despite Edith's protests and even her eventual confession that she was Jewish, he married her and kept her identity a secret.In wrenching detail, Edith recalls a life of constant, almost paralyzing fear. She tells of German officials who casually questioned the lineage of her parents; of how, when giving birth to her daughter, she refused all painkillers, afraid that in an altered state of mind she might reveal something of her past; and of how, after her husband was captured by the Soviet army, she was bombed out of her house and had to hide while drunken Russian soldiers raped women on the street.Yet despite the risk it posed to her life, Edith created a remarkable record of survival. She saved every document and set of papers issued to her, as well as photographs she managed to take inside labor camps. Now part of the permanent collection at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., these hundreds of documents, several of which are included in this volume, form the fabric of a gripping new chapter in the history of the Holocaust -- complex, troubling, and ultimately triumphant.",

        "Description": "I am grateful beyond words for the example of the lanterns shared in this memoir whose lives I hope will illuminate my children's, your children's, and the paths of countless others coming behind.--Marian Wright Edelman, from the PrefaceMarian Wright Edelman, \"the most influential children's advocate in the country\" (The Washington Post), shares stories from her life at the center of this century's most dramatic civil rights struggles. She pays tribute to the extraordinary personal mentors who helped light her way: Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Fannie Lou Hamer, William Sloane Coffin, Ella Baker, Mae Bertha Carter, and many others.She celebrates the lives of the great Black women of Bennettsville, South Carolina-Miz Tee, Miz Lucy, Miz Kate-who along with her parents formed a formidable and loving network of community support for the young Marian Wright as a Black girl growing up in the segregated South. We follow the author to Spelman College in the late 1950s, when the school was a hotbed of civil rights activism, and where, through excerpts from her honest and passionate college journal, we witness a national leader in the making and meet the people who inspired and empowered her, including Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, Howard Zinn, and Charles E. Merrill, Jr.Lanterns takes us to Mississippi in the 1960s, where Edelman was the first and only Black woman lawyer. Her account of those years is a riveting first-hand addition to the literature of civil rights: \"The only person I recognized in the menacing crowd as I walked towards the front courthouse steps was [a] veteran New York Times reporter. He neither acknowledged me nor met my eyes. I knew then what it was like to be a poor Black person in Mississippi: alone.\" And we follow Edelman as she leads Bobby Kennedy on his fateful trip to see Mississippi poverty and hunger for himself, a powerful personal experience for the young RFK that helped awaken a nation's conscience to child hunger and poverty. Lanterns is illustrated with thirty of the author's personal photographs and includes \"A Parent's Pledge\" and \"Twenty-five More Lessons for Life,\" an inspiration to all of us-parents, grandparents, teachers, religious and civic leaders-to guide, protect, and love our children every day so that they will become, in Marian Wright Edelman's moving vision, the healing agents for national transformation.",

        "Description": "The extraordinary life of Jackie Robinson is illuminated as never before in this full-scale biography by Arnold Rampersad, who was chosen by Jack's widow, Rachel, to tell her husband's story, and was given unprecedented access to his private papers. We are brought closer than we have ever been to the great ballplayer, a man of courage and quality who became a pivotal figure in the areas of race and civil rights.Born in the rural South, the son of a sharecropper, Robinson was reared in southern California. We see him blossom there as a student-athlete as he struggled against poverty and racism to uphold the beliefs instilled in him by his mother--faith in family, education, America, and God. We follow Robinson through World War II, when, in the first wave of racial integration in the armed forces, he was commissioned as an officer, then court-martialed after refusing to move to the back of a bus. After he plays in the Negro National League, we watch the opening of an all-American drama as, late in 1945, Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers recognized Jack as the right player to break baseball's color barrier--and the game was forever changed.Jack's never-before-published letters open up his relationship with his family, especially his wife, Rachel, whom he married just as his perilous venture of integrating baseball began. Her memories are a major resource of the narrative as we learn about the severe harassment Robinson endured from teammates and opponents alike; about death threats and exclusion; about joy and remarkable success. We watch his courageous response to abuse, first as a stoic endurer, then as a fighter who epitomized courage and defiance.We see his growing friendship with white players like Pee Wee Reese and the black teammates who followed in his footsteps, and his embrace by Brooklyn's fans. We follow his blazing career: 1947, Rookie of the Year; 1949, Most Valuable Player; six pennants in ten seasons, and 1962, induction into the Hall of Fame. But sports were merely one aspect of his life. We see his business ventures, his leading role in the community, his early support of Martin Luther King Jr., his commitment to the civil rights movement at a crucial stage in its evolution; his controversial associations with Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Humphrey, Goldwater, Nelson Rockefeller, and Malcolm X.Rampersad's magnificent biography leaves us with an indelible image of a principled man who was passionate in his loyalties and opinions: a baseball player who could focus a crowd's attention as no one before or since; an activist at the crossroads of his people's struggle; a dedicated family man whose last years were plagued by illness and tragedy, and who died prematurely at fifty-two. He was a pathfinder, an American hero, and he now has the biography he deserves.",

She also throws in a completely candid account of her love life, just in case some of it is tax deductible. What begins as a private account of expenses rapidly becomes, through Katya's chronic delusions of grandeur, a matter of public record: first as a tawdry gossip column, then as a salacious book, and finally as a Hollywood B-movie.Bitingly written with wit and style reminiscent of Candace Bushnell, Ad\u00e8le Lang's novel is a cutting, bitchy, hilarious take on the young-single-British-woman genre.",

Then factor in time to yourself, time with your friends, romance with your partner, personal goals or interests?how will you ever juggle all this? The key is to approach the family not as a set of separate individuals pulling in twelve different directions, but as members within a group who all really do want to arrive together at the same destination.The Eliums teach us how to distinguish between the service-oriented environment of work, where energy is focused on a single goal or outcome, and the care-oriented environment of family, where there are multiple issues that need attention. When faced with conflict you will learn to ask, \"What does this group of people need, including me?\"?a questioning process known as FamilyMind.",

        "Description": "The story opens in contemporary Miami, where a young Cuban woman has for years been searching in vain for details of her birth mother. All she knows of her past is that her grandfather had fled the turbulent Havana of the 1960s for Miami with her in tow, and that pinned to her sweater - possibly by her mother - were a few treasured lines of a Pablo Neruda poem. These facts remain her only tenuous links to her history, until a mysterious parcel arrives in the mail. Inside the soft, worn box are layers of writings and photographs. Fitting these pieces together with insights she gleans from several trips back to Havana, the daughter reconstructs the life of her mother, her youthful affair with the enigmatic Che, and the child she bore by the handsome rebel.",

        "Title": "The Setting of the Pearl: Vienna under Hitler",
        "Authors": "By Weyr, Thomas",
        "Description": "When Adolf Hitler seized Vienna in the Anschluss of 1938, he called the city \"a pearl to which he would give a proper setting.\" But the setting he left behind seven years later was one of ruin and destruction--a physical, spiritual, and intellectual wasteland.     Here is a grippingly narrated and heartbreaking account of the debasement of one of Europe's great cities. Thomas Weyr shows how Hitler turned Vienna from a vibrant metropolis that was the cradle of modernism into a drab provincial town. In this riveting narrative, we meet Austrian traitors like Arthur Seyss-Inquart and mass murderers like Odilo Globocnik; proconsuls like Joseph Buerckel, who hacked Austria into seven pieces, and Baldur von Schirach, who dreamed of making Vienna into a Nazi capital on the Danube--and failed miserably. More painfully, Weyr chronicles the swift destruction of a rich Jewish culture and the removal of the city's 200,000 Jews through murder, exile, and deportation. Vienna never regained the global role the city had once played. Today, Weyr concludes, only the monuments remain--beautiful but lifeless.     This is not only the story of Nazi leaders but of how the Viennese themselves lived and died: those who embraced Hitler, those who resisted, and the many who merely, in the local phrase, \"ran after the rabbit.\" The author draws on his own experiences as a child in Vienna under Nazi rule in 1938, and those of his parents and friends, plus extensive documentary research, to craft a vivid historical narrative that chillingly captures how a once-great city lost its soul under Hitler.",

        "Description": "Angus Wilson (1913-1991) led one of the most remarkable and, until now, uncharted lives in the annals of twentieth-century literature. Here in this long-awaited biography, acclaimed novelist Margaret Drabble portrays Angus Wilson as one of the most brilliant writers of his time, on a par with such literary greats as Graham Greene, Kingsley Amis, and John Osborne. In this first full biography, Drabble traces Wilson's meteoric career as novelist, critic, lecturer, and man of letters.At first an assistant cataloguer at the British Museum, Wilson burst onto the literary scene like a blazing comet in 1949 with a collection of short stories called The Wrong Set. This stunning debut was followed by such memorable books as Hemlock and After, The Middle Age of Mrs. Eliot, The Old Men at the Zoo, and his most enduring and famous novel, Anglo-Saxon Attitudes.At once painfully insecure and highly narcissistic, Wilson both captivated and repelled many of the great literary figures of twentieth-century England, inspiring Rebecca West to exclaim nastily that Wilson reminded her of Jane Eyre. Yet Angus Wilson also served as a great influence for many of today's writers including Martin Amis, Jonathan Raban, V S. Pritchett, and Margaret Drabble herself. His satiric, often grotesque, but in the end sympathetic portrayal of his female characters also endeared him to millions of female readers.What makes Wilson particularly extraordinary to a new generation of readers is his decision to live life, even as early as the 1940s, as an open homosexual through his lifelong relationship with Tony Garrett and his public opposition to discriminatory homosexual laws. Above all, Angus Wilson is the portrait of an artist of enormous courage, a man who confronted challenge to the end.",
