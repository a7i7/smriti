        "Description": "There's been a murder in Finchl\" the vicar's wife tells Lori Shepherd upon Lori's return from her trip to America. This is not the kind of greeting she had expected to receive bock at her usually idyllic English cottage. Lori simply can't believe it. There hadn't been a murder in Finch since 1872, when one shepherd bashed another with the hook of his crook. When Lori discovers the victim was Prunella \"Pruneface\" Hooper, however, she is less surprised: the newly arrived Pruneface had quickly become privy to everyone's secrets - and used her secret knowledge to plant rumors, nurture backbiting, resurrect feuds, and season it all with downright lies. Almost everyone had a reason to want her dead.Despite her hectic home schedule with her three-year-old twins, Lori agrees to investigate because the police have come up short. It seems nobody in the close-knit town wants to talk. But Lori is bound and determined she'll get tongues wagging and solve the case. She knows she needs the help of Aunt Dimity, but she hadn't expected help from the vicar's nephew, Nicholas Fox. Why is a self-defense instructor from London so interested in solving this case? And, most important, why does he have to be so darn handsome?Lori tries to put personal feelings aside as the newly formed team of Lori, Nicholas, and Aunt Dimity forges ahead - but narrowing the list of suspects remains a major challenge. Fortunately, Aunt Dimity's supernatural skills - and her insight into uncovering the true goodness of human nature - lead Lori down a path not only to unraveling the mystery, but also to uncovering a lot of good among the bad.",

        "Authors": "By Greer, Germaine",
        "Description": "When Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch was first published in 1970, it created a shock wave of recognition in women that was felt around the world. It went on to become an international best-seller - translated into more than twelve languages - and a landmark in the history of the women's movement. Positing that sexual liberation is the key to women's liberation, Greer looks at the inherent and unalterable biological differences between men and women as well as at the profound psychological differences that result from social conditioning. Drawing on history, literature, biology, and popular culture, Greer's searing examination of women's oppression is a passionately argued social commentary that is both an important historical record of where we've been and a shockingly relevant treatise on what still remains to be achieved. As Jennifer Baumgardner points out in her introduction, The Female Eunuch is essential to our understanding of feminism, for it reveals the origins of many of the attitudes and rights young women take for granted just one generation after their revolutionary introduction.",

Despite the solitude of his past life, Bartholomew, once a deadly sniper, now lives among all manner of slum dwellers, thieves, and murderers. As he prowls the city, he becomes involved with Jessie, a Creole prostitute who engages him in a venture that has its origins in the complexities and despair of the Civil War. And he befriends a deputy inspector of customs named Herman Melville - who, largely forgotten as a writer, is condemned to live in the wake of his vanished literary success and in the turmoil of his fractured family.",

        "Title": "Facing Up: How to Rescue the Economy from Crushing Debt and Restore the American Dream",
        "Authors": "By Peterson, Peter G.",
        "Description": "Facing Up is like a powerful dose of truth serum injected into the body politic of America's debate over budgets and deficits, investment and productivity - and, ultimately, the future of the American Dream.In these pages, Peter G. Peterson, former United States Secretary of Commerce and one of Wall Street's preeminent investment bankers, dares to speak the \"unspeakable\" - truths that most of Washington's establishment, Democrats and Republicans alike, find too politically dangerous to acknowledge to the public.Among the sobering facts presented in Peterson's compelling argument are: Despite the talk of deficit reduction in Washington, the Clinton administration's own budget forecasts show that another trillion dollars will be added in the next four years to the already bloated national debt; onerous as today's deficits are, they are early warning signs of the more nightmarish reality to come if we don't get the exploding costs of Medicare, Social Security and other \"entitlement\" programs under control; although most people think \"welfare\" goes to the poor, the vast majority of U.S. entitlement spending is diffused without any regard to financial need. Only one-sixth of all entitlement dollars serves to raise Americans out of poverty; today's leadership generation - accustomed to avoiding hard choices and to financing today's lavish consumption with debt - is the first to turn its back on the young, the future, and the promise of increased opportunity for all; without rigorous cost-controlling reforms, health care will continue to be the \"Pac-Man\" of GNP eating up ever-larger resources as baby boomers age and more people live into their eighties and nineties.The Reaganomic approach to deficit reduction was doomed because of its reliance on curtailing benefits to the poor. The Clinton approach is flawed because of its reliance on soaking the rich. Pointing out the most politically explosive truth of our day, Peterson shows that balancing the budget requires a measure of sacrifice from the broad American middle class as well as the truly wealthy.In its concluding chapter, Facing Up offers the fairest, most detailed, most compassionate, and most workable program ever presented for zeroing out the budget deficit and turning it to surplus by the year 2000. Using an \"affluence test\" for entitlement programs that would end welfare for the well-off, and showing how to make the needed choices and trade-offs, Peterson's plan is certain to be widely debated. It is the new benchmark by which to judge the sincerity of our political leaders and their commitment to balancing the budget and \"doing the right thing\" for America's children and our national future.",

Lamb in Love is set in a rural English village the year of the Apollo moon landing and tells of two people surprised, halfway through their lives by...what? passion? desire? love? They haven't the experience to quite identify it. Norris and Vida have known each other forever. Neither has had any idea how to go about falling in love. Vida Stephen has been nanny for twenty years to the mentally handicapped son of a rich American widower. Every day for most of her life, she nods to Norris Lamb, the postmaster, when calling for her mail. Sometimes Norris offers pretty stamps to the boy. A fussy, stamp-collecting bachelor and church organist, Norris has fallen suddenly, amazingly, and secretly in love with Vida. Witness to Norris and Vida's halting, at times embarrassing courtship is Vida's charge, Manford - mute and clumsy and yet possessed of an odd and gentle intelligence. It is through Manford, even thanks to him, that Norris and Vida finally come to recognize each other and themselves. Carrie Brown has an affinity for the way love transforms the most ordinary and imperfect people. In Lamb in Love, she celebrates a man and a woman who discover in themselves a bravery that allows them to become the heroes of their own story.",

        "Authors": "By Wesley, Valerie Wilson",
        "Description": "A trio of great single women is being driven to distraction; they have one thing in common -- Randall Hollis, a successful art dealer at the top of his game. Randall is rich, handsome, and charming -- the true-to-life dream lover of these smart, independent women who all find themselves passionately involved with him during the same seven-month period. There's Medora Jackson, an artist who has loved Randall since college and is now desperately trying to cut him loose. But turning Randall Hollis out of her life will end up being far more difficult than she thinks. There's Ana Reese-Mitchell, a wealthy widow and art collector who is haunted by the death of her best friend and the specter of her cruel late husband. She hopes Randall Hollis will be her second chance at love. And there's ambitious Taylor Benedict, a graduate student in art history who is coming to terms with her parents' divorce and problems from her childhood that she can't chase away. She's sure that Randall Hollis will be the first rung on her ladder to success. Randall Hollis is a man for all seasons, representing a different fantasy for each of the women who love him. As the novel unfolds, each woman will discover more about herself than she bargained for. And each, along with the errant Randall himself, will finally know the true meaning of love and the peace that comes with forgiveness.",

        "Title": "Behind the Oval Office: Winning the Presidency in the Nineties",
        "Authors": "By Morris, Dick",
        "Description": "Dick Morris has written the ultimate inside story about the dramatic reelection of President Clinton, one that is certain to stir controversy about the way politics really works in America today. No one before has so vividly described what policy advisers, pollsters, and advertisers do behind the scenes in the Oval Office. And no one has so acutely identified the new political forces that are dominating America today.Dick Morris was, as Time magazine put it, the most influential private citizen in America. He was President Clinton's secret election strategist, invited to advise the demoralized president in the wake of the midterm debacle of 1994 that gave Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole control of Congress and, it seemed, a certain Republican victory in the 1996 presidential campaign. It did not turn out that way. Clinton made the biggest comeback in the history of modern politics, and he did it largely because of his partnership with Dick Morris, the man whose remarkable political insights helped Clinton become governor of Arkansas in 1978 and rescued him from defeat in 1982. They had a rapport that Clinton himself has called \"probably unique in American history.\"The assignment after the 1994 Republican congressional victory began in utmost secrecy. Morris, who had to cross the road from being adviser to Republicans such as William Weld, Dan Coats, and Trent Lott, was for months known only as Charlie, an unknown source calling Clinton's private White House telephone number. None of Clinton's Cabinet or inner circle knew anything about this, and they could not understand why Clinton began speaking in a new voice. When Clinton decided he needed Morris in the White House working with others, Morris became an object of intense scrutiny, speculation, and envy. He was Washington's great mystery man. He refused on-the-record press interviews. He was controversial. But he succeeded brilliantly. He laid the foundation for Clinton's return to the White House for a second term. He decided to write a book about it all--about his view of Clinton, his own role, and his perception of a change in the mood of the voters. In August, the president asked Morris to wait until after the election to write this book and to make it \"right for Bill Clinton and right for Dick Morris.\"And then Morris blew it.On a day to savor his triumph, on the day when a resurgent Clinton addressed the Democratic Convention, Morris was on the way out in disgrace: revealed as having had a relationship with a prostitute who claimed he talked freely of his work for the president.In Behind the Oval Office, Dick Morris makes no excuses for his personal conduct. He is candid about it--painfully so--contemplating the wreckage of his career and the damage to his marriage. But with his book he achieves something significant on three levels. Shedding light on the unseen forces that drive politics today, he reveals just how the Republicans were routed by a combination of a Democratic shift to the center and an unprecedented and secret selling strategy. We have a box-seat view of the struggles in the White House for the soul of the Democratic party. We are taken deep into the hidden relationship between President Clinton and Republican Senate leader Trent Lott. The author explains how the deals they cut formulated the laws they passed--laws that doomed Dole's bid for the presidency.And then there is William Jefferson Clinton. Morris gives us a three-dimensional portrait of the man and the politician. He draws on their twenty-year relationship to explain Clinton to us so vividly, with such new perspective, that we meet him as if for the first time. Morris lets us finally understand Bill Clinton and gives us vital clues about what he will do for the next four years. And we see Hillary Rodham Clinton at work and at home, facing up to political storms and adding her voice to the disputations about which way the Democrats should go.Finally, Morris, the master of polling, gives us a surprising perspective on the values and desires of America, the key that enabled Clinton to respond and unlock the door to a second term in the White House, the first Democratic president to achieve that in fifty years.This is an extraordinary book with a compelling narrative and incisive analysis by a political operator of unparalleled experience. It is filled with insights, touched with pathos. It is must reading for everyone who cares about the future of American democracy.",

        "Description": "August in L.A. is a miserable month no matter what year it is, but August 1947 was shaping up to be a singularly awful one. The House Un-American Activities Committee had come to town and was making everyone in Hollywood, the Technicolor heart of L.A., nervous. And all the moguls in town were twitching because Warner Bros. had decided to take its greatest wartime romance, Passage to Lisbon, and pull a sequel, Love Me Again, out of it. Why were they twitching? Because this meant that the boys at Warner had a surefire hit on their hands.Warner wasn't so sure about that. They had received an anonymous note telling them that their screenwriter was a Red and with HUAC in town that meant trouble. So Warner did what any studio would do - they called in the Hollywood Security Agency to find out the real story and hush it up. Whatever it was.The Hollywood Security Agency specialized in the discreet laundering of the studios' dirty linen, and nobody at the agency was better at that than Scott Elliott, their newest operative and a one-time Paramount contract player. Elliott had returned from the war to find that nobody needed his services as an actor and had drifted into security work as a way of staying in touch with the movie business he loved.But the long odds against saving Love Me Again get longer when the screenwriter turns up dead. To find his killer, Elliott must untangle lives twisted by Hollywood and the war with only a bloodstained copy of the script as his guide. What he discovers is a trail of misplaced loyalties and secret dreams that reveals both the murderer and the mystery of his own future.",

It is a theory that offers a liberating vision of childhood troubles and an exciting approach to themes such as fate and fatalism, character and desire, family influence and freedom, and, most of all, calling - that invisible mystery at the center of every life that speaks to the fundamental question \"What is it, in my heart, that I must do, be, and have?

A former speechwriter for the Reagan White House, Charen describes how the left has continually attempted to rewrite history, all the while refusing to learn from it. She fearlessly calls out the prominent liberal media figures, professors, and opinion makers who flocked to Castro\u2019s Cuba and called it paradise, visited the Soviet Union and proclaimed its glorious future, and who, only a generation ago, proclaimed communism to be a \"force of good\" in the world. She won't let them get away with their snide disdain for America when the lessons of the past should have humbled them long ago. From D.C. elites Madeleine Albreight, Bill Clinton, John Kerry, and Ted Kennedy, to Hollywood celebs like Woody Allen and Jane Fonda, to academic snobs like Noam Chomsky and Susan Sontag, Charen\u2019s devastating critique of the left's philosophical incompetence is a must-read for Americans on both sides of the aisle.",

That life suddenly shatters with the appearance, after almost eighteen years, of Veronica (Ronnee), her biracial daughter born in Mississippi in the sixties when Miriam was a civil rights activist. Hot tempered, sensitive, manipulative and deeply hurt at her mother's disappearance from her life, Ronnee has been raised by her father, a formerly brilliant college professor who forbade her to see her white mother. Half a Heart charts the emotionally fraught terrain of the mother and daughter's reunion and Ronnee's divided sense of self and loyalty. With which family, and which race, does she identify? How does all this affect her relationships with her newly discovered half-sister, her white boyfriend, and the father she is rebelling against? Half a Heart is a searingly honest novel of public and private ideals betrayed and hopes reignited by one of our foremost novelists.",

It was a time when players played for the love of the game, a time when dynasties were born and baseball became the national pastime. And what a pastime it was.With Yogi Berra at their heart, Casey Stengel&#39;s Yankees took on their heralded archrivals: the Cleveland Indians, the New York Giants, the Brooklyn Dodgers, and, of course, the Boston Red Sox. And with those teams was Yogi&#39;s constellation of contemporaries, a who&#39;s who of the Hall of Fame: Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Sandy Koufax, Willie Mays, Duke Snider, Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson, Phil Rizzuto, and many others.Each season brought its own drama, and it&#39;s all brought to life by the man who witnessed it.

        "Title": "Hating America: The New World Sport",
        "Authors": "By Gibson, John C.",
        "Description": "John Gibson is one of the Fox News Channel's most outspoken personalities. Now, as the aftershocks of the war in Iraq reverberate around the world, Gibson exposes the outrageous tenor of anti-American sentiment filling newsprint and airwaves beyond our borders and how disagreements over policy have mushroomed into poisonous hatred.\"I loathe America . . . and what it has done to Iraq and the rest of the helpless world.\"\u2014Margaret Drabble, British novelist From the \"Arab street\" to the halls of even the most historically friendly foreign governments, extreme anti-Americanism has grown disturbingly pervasive throughout the world since the shell-shocking moment of 9/11. Over the year that followed, Gibson writes, \"I began to watch the overseas press with a morbid fascination punctuated by bursts of outrage. The things that were being said about America and Americans were marked by an off-the-charts level of venom, a scandalous parade of mistaken assumptions, an endless font of suspicion, mistrust, and the promulgation of outright, willful lies. The viciousness of commentary on America was breathtaking.\" \"Damn Americans. Hate those bastards.\" --Carolyn Parrish, Canadian parliament member And, as Gibson traces, the hate speech has gone well beyond the usual suspects in the Middle East, infecting our erstwhile allies in Europe, Asia, and even Canada. British Prime Minister Tony Blair complained that \"some of the rhetoric I hear used about America is more savage than some of the rhetoric I hear about Saddam and the Iraqi regime.\" Presumptuous Belgian officials attempted to bring American officials up on war-crimes charges. And special hatred was reserved for President George W. Bush, whom one Australian newspaper dismissed as \"the village idiot.\"  As America defends its security in the ongoing war on terror, Gibson argues, we must be prepared to face this growing tide of resentment abroad, which will only result in serious consequences for the haters themselves. For the anti-Americans, he argues, would \"like us to forget that those who hate us may eventually try to kill us -- because they now know that we will never allow that to happen without exacting a price on those who would attempt it.\"",

        "Title": "The Teen Weight-Loss Solution: The Safe and Effective Path to Health and Self-Confidence",
        "Authors": "By Schwartz, Erika",
        "Description": "Dr. Erika Schwartz provides parents with insight into the hormonal challenges that fuel teens' battles with weight and outlines her plan for protection from the perilous side effects of obesity in The Teen Weight-Loss Solution. This inspirational and scientifically sound book reveals how teens can lose weight by understanding their changing bodies and addressing their health needs from the inside out. The Teen Weight-Loss Solution offers the stories of real teens coping with the heartbreaking physical and emotional consequences of obesity. Dr. Schwartz reveals that the trigger for budding weight problems in teens can often be traced to the beginning of puberty, when their bodies are overloaded with hormones that impact mood, energy, motivation, and weight gain. Teens feel condemned to exist in their fuller figures and cannot understand the hormonal correlation between their emotional havoc and their expanding bodies. Dr. Schwartz's weight-loss solution teaches parents that they must look beyond the notion of managing their teen's weight problem with an old-fashioned forced diet and address not only body weight, but the whole individual. Parents must make the hormonal connection to obesity for their teen and help their doctor devise a plan that will help their child manage his or her health by monitoring diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices. Dr. Schwartz also reveals a revolutionary step-by-step, dose-by-dose plan for how natural hormones and supplements can be used to help achieve optimal balance of a teen's raging hormones for improved mood, energy level, and weight loss. The Teen Weight-Loss Solution offers new hope and a tried-and-proven plan that parents can implement today to start teens on the path to both a brighter future and a lifetime of health and self-confidence.",

        "Title": "Because He Could",
        "Authors": "By Morris, Dick and McGann, Eileen",
        "Description": "Who is Bill Clinton?A man whose presidency was disgraced by impeachment -- yet who remains one of the most popular presidents of our time.A man whose autobiography, My Life, was panned by critics as a self-indulgent daily diary -- but rode the bestseller lists for months.A man whose policies changed America at the close of the twentieth century -- yet whose weakness left us vulnerable to terror at the dawn of the twenty-first.No one better understands the inner Bill Clinton, that creature of endless and vexing contradiction, than Dick Morris. From the Arkansas governor's races through the planning of the triumphant 1996 reelection, Morris was Clinton's most valued political adviser. Now, in the wake of Clinton's million-selling memoir My Life, Morris and his wife, Eileen McGann, set the record straight with Because He Could, a frank and perceptive deconstruction of the story Clinton tells -- and the many more revealing stories he leaves untold.With the same keen insight they brought to Hillary Clinton's life in their recent bestseller Rewriting History, Morris and McGann uncover the hidden sides of the complicated and sometimes dysfunctional former president. Whereas Hillary is anxious to mask who she really is, they show, Bill Clinton inadvertently reveals himself at every turn -- as both brilliant and undisciplined, charming yet often filled with rage, willing to take wild risks in his personal life but deeply reluctant to use the military to protect our national security. The Bill Clinton who emerges is familiar -- reflexively blaming every problem on right-wing persecutors or na\u00efve advisers -- but also surprising: passive, reactive, working desperately to solve a laundry list of social problems yet never truly grasping the real thrust of his own presidency. And while he courted danger in his personal life, the authors argue that Clinton's downfall has far less to do with his private demons than with his fear of the one person who controlled his future: his own first lady.Sharp and stylishly written, full of revealing insider anecdotes, Because He Could is a fresh and probing portrait of one of the most fascinating, and polarizing, figures of our time.",

        "Description": "It is mid-October, 1997, harvest time in the Columbia Basin of central Washington state, a rich apple- and pear-growing region. Ben Givens, recently widowed, is a retired heart surgeon, once admired for his steadiness of hand, his precision, his endurance. He has terminal colon cancer. While Ben does not readily accept defeat, he is determined to avoid suffering rather than engage it. And so, accompanied by his two hunting dogs, he sets out through the mythic American West-sage deserts, yawning canyons, dusty ranches, vast orchards-on his last hunt. The main issues for Ben as a doctor had been tactical and so it would be with his death. But he hadn't considered the persuasiveness of memory-the promise he made to his wife Rachel, the love of his life, during World War II. Or life's mystery. On his journey he meets a young couple who are \"forever,\" a drifter offering left-handed advice that might lessen the pain, a veterinarian with a touch only a heart surgeon would recognize, a rancher bent on destruction, a migrant worker who tests Ben's ability to understand. And just when he thinks there is no turning back, nothing to lose that wasn't lost, his power of intervention is called upon and his very identity tested. Full of humanity, passion, and moral honesty, East of the Mountains is a bold and beautiful novel of personal discovery.",

Four-star generals who lead the military during wartime reign like proconsuls abroad in peacetime. Secretive Green Berets trained to hunt down terrorists are assigned to seduce ruthless authoritarian regimes. Pimply young soldiers taught to seize airstrips instead play mayor, detective, and social worker in a gung-ho but ill-fated attempt to rebuild a nation after the fighting stops. The Mission is a boots-on-the-ground account of America's growing dependence on our military to manage world affairs, describing a clash of culture and purpose through the eyes of soldiers and officers themselves. With unparalleled access to all levels of the military, Dana Priest traveled to eighteen countriesincluding Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Colombia, Kosovo, Indonesia, and Nigeriatalking to generals, admirals, Special Forces A-teams, and infantry troops. Blending Ernie Pyle's worm's-eye view with David Halberstam's altitude, this book documents a historic and thought-provoking trend, one made even more significant in the aftermath of September 11 as the country turns to its warriors to solve the complex international challenges ahead. 16 pages of b/w photographs.",

In Skyhook, Nance crafts another winner. The \"boomerang box,\" a high-tech computer program designed to save a plane experiencing flight trouble, is Dr. Ben Coles's baby. After a test run over the Gulf of Alaska goes awry, he suspects someone has sabotaged the plane's computer systems. And mysteriously, and almost simultaneously, April Rosen is horrified to learn that her father's plane has narrowly escaped a midair collision over the same patch of sea.  While Dr. Coles considers the uncomfortable notion that someone within his own company might wish him harm, Rosen begins her search for the cause of her father's hair-raising \"near miss.\" But what both don't know is this: their fears have a common source. They are being watched by people in the Pentagon, who believe that the two might stumble upon the secret that will destroy them all before Skyhook has a chance to succeed.  What is Skyhook's real purpose? Is it commercial or military? And will its early implementation compromise the safety of fliers everywhere?
