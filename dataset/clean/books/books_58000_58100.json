Drawing on the best biblical and historical scholarship, respected New Testament scholar Luke Timothy Johnson demonstrates that the \"real Jesus\" is the one experienced in the present through faith rather than the one found in speculative historical reconstructions. A new preface by the author presents his point of view on the most recent rounds of this lively debate.",

        "Description": "In the words of the commission\u2019s co-chairmen, this is the compelling inside story of how the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States\u2014more commonly known as the 9/11 Commission\u2014managed to succeed against all odds in producing a report that made clear what went wrong and why.The mandate of the 9/11 Commission was daunting and all-encompassing. In its investigation of the events leading up to and including September 11, 2001, the commission had to examine U.S. diplomacy, military policy, intelligence agencies, law enforcement, border and aviation security, and congressional oversight, as well as the immediate response to the terrorist attacks, while also investigating the lethal enemy al Qaeda. The creation of the 9/11 Commission was blocked for months by the Bush administration, and after its inception in December 2002 the commission spent months mired in a series of controversies\u2014the resignation of its first chairman, Henry Kissinger, and vice-chairman, George Mitchell; an inadequate budget; an extraordinarily polarized atmosphere leading up to the 2004 presidential election; the conflicting demands of various interest groups; the distrust of the victims\u2019 families; difficulties in obtaining access to highly classified documents and to al Qaeda detainees; and a media eager to record stumbles and gaffes. The obstacles were great, and the expectations for a blue-ribbon panel are never high\u2014yet somehow the 9/11 Commission overcame everything that might have thwarted it and succeeded beyond anyone\u2019s greatest expectation, holding a series of hearings that riveted the nation, producing a unanimous and widely heralded report that became a national best seller, and issuing recommendations that led to the most significant reform of America\u2019s national security agencies in decades. The 9/11 Commission report slaked the national thirst for accountability. Here for the first time is the story of how the commission came together to produce its landmark document.",

        "Description": "\"With uncommon sensitivity and intelligence... [this] book offers parents a window into their kids' often tumultuous relationships with classmates.\" - TimeFriends broaden our children\u2019s horizons, share their joys and secrets, and accompany   them on their journeys into ever wider worlds. But friends can also gossip and betray,   tease and exclude. Children can cause untold suffering, not only for their peers   but for parents as well. In this wise and insightful book, psychologist Michael Thompson,   Ph.D., and children\u2019s book author Catherine O\u2019Neill Grace, illuminate the crucial   and often hidden role that friendship plays in the lives of children from birth through   adolescence. Drawing on fascinating new research as well as their own extensive   experience in schools, Thompson and Grace demonstrate that children\u2019s friendships   begin early\u2013in infancy\u2013and run exceptionally deep in intensity and loyalty. As children   grow, their friendships become more complex and  layered but also more emotionally   fraught, marked by both extraordinary intimacy and bewildering cruelty. As parents,   we watch, and often live through vicariously, the tumult that our children experience   as they encounter the \u201ccool\u201d crowd, shifting alliances, bullies, and disloyal best   friends. Best Friends, Worst Enemies brings to life the drama of childhood relationships,   guiding parents to a deeper understanding of the motives and meanings of social behavior.   Here you will find penetrating discussions of the difference between friendship and   popularity, how boys and girls deal in unique ways with intimacy and commitment,   whether all kids need a best friend, why cliques form and what you can do about them. Filled with anecdotes that ring amazingly true to life, Best Friends, Worst Enemies probes the magic and the heartbreak that all children experience with their friends.   Parents, teachers, counselors\u2013indeed anyone who cares about children\u2013will find this   an eye-opening and wonderfully affirming book.\"Relevant and compelling... Parents will be wiser for reading.\" - The Boston Globe\"The stories in this book come from many perspectives - those of therapists, educators, and parents. The wise, kind authors give us a fresh and cogent analysis of this critically important issue.\" - Mary Pipher, Ph.D., author of Reviving Ophelia",

        "Description": "A finalist for the 2000 National Book Award in non-fiction. What Guns, Germs, and Steel did for colonial history, this book will do for present-day anthropology. Darkness in El Dorado is an explosive account of how ruthless journalists, self-serving anthropologists, and obsessed scientists placed one of the Amazon basin's oldest tribes on the cusp of extinction. First coming to prominence in the 1960s, the \"savage\" Yanomami Indians were the subject of anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon's multi-million-copy bestseller Yanomamo: The Fierce People and many award-winning films. These exemplars of human ferocity, however, did not arrive at such dispositions naturally. Patrick Tierney describes how the Yanomami's internecine warfare was triggered by repeated visits of leading anthropologists from around the world as well as by the Atomic Energy Commission, which wished to use Yanomami blood in radiation studies in the mid-1960s. This is an epic, compelling work, sure to shake the very foundations of American anthropology.",

        "Title": "Marching Toward Hell: America and Islam After Iraq",
        "Authors": "By Scheuer, Michael",
        "Description": "When Michael Scheuer first questioned the goals of the Iraq War in his 2004 bestseller Imperial Hubris, policymakers and ordinary citizens alike stood up and took notice. Now, Scheuer offers a scathing and frightening look at how the Iraq War has been a huge setback to America's War on Terror, making our enemy stronger and altering the geopolitical landscape in ways that are profoundly harmful to U.S. interests and security concerns. Marching Toward Hell is not just another attack on the Bush administration. Rather, it sounds a critical alarm that must be heard in order to preserve the nation's security. Scheuer outlines the ways that America's foreign policy since the end of the Cold War has undermined the very goals for which we are fighting and played right into bin Laden's hands. The ongoing instability in Iraq, for example, has provided al Qaeda and its allies with the one thing they want most: a safe haven from which to launch operations across borders into countries that were previously difficult for them to reach. With U.S. forces and resources spread thinner every day, the war has depleted our strength and brought al Qaeda a kind of success that it could not have achieved on its own. A twenty-plus-year CIA veteran, Scheuer headed the agency's Osama bin Laden unit, managed its covert-action operations, and authored its rendition program. Scheuer spent his career developing strategies to keep America safe, by any means deemed necessary by the presidents he served. It was his job to take available intelligence and devise plans to protect Americans, without considering bias, position, or even existing alliances. In Marching Toward Hell, Scheuer takes on the questions of \"What went wrong?\" and \"How can we fix this?\" and proposes a plan to cauterize the damage that has already been done and get American strategy back on track. He lists a number of painful recommendations for how we must shift our ideological, military, and political views in order to survive, even if that means disagreeing with Israeli policy or launching more brutal campaigns against terrorists. America holds its destiny in its hands, Scheuer says, yet not nearly enough has been done to defend America and destroy its Islamist enemies. This is an eye-opening, alarming, contentious, and ultimately fascinating examination of how far off track the War on Terror has gone, and a critical read in understanding what we must do to save it.",

In fact, the real-life stories in this book show that medical mistakes are increasing in frequency&#151;and worse, that the system is designed more to cover up these errors than prevent them.",

One stands in a spolight at the Winter Antiques Show: a pine blanket chest made for a farmer in the 1750s and still wearing its original coat of robin's egg blue paint. The asking price is $250,000. A few blocks away, on display at Sotheby's, is a rare Chippendale card table, created in Philadelphia in 1759. The auction house is hoping that bidding for the piece will reach one million dollars. Also on display at Sotheby's is an inlaid sofa table from the Federal period, valued at $100,000, one of the prized possessions of a collector forced by circumstance to sell his cherished objects.How these three pieces came to be at the apex of the American antiques market is the story of the evolution of the world of antiques: a world of bold enterprise, canny deal making, consuming aesthetic vision, and obsessive pursuit - all fueled by a passionate attraction to objects.",

It can't miss. Trust me.\"Now comes a smart, savvy, irreverent book that takes deadly aim at these and other financial prophets. As refreshing as it is informative, this no-nonsense, commonsense guide shows you how Wall Street and the markets really work, and how to decipher the often confusing or misleading predictions of \"experts.\" Written by a wise, witty, seasoned Wall Street observer and featuring a wealth of devastatingly clever and satiric cartoons by renowned New Yorker cartoonist Henry Martin, \"It's a Sure Thing\" puts you, the investor, squarely inside the Wall Street \"loop.\" Not only will you be entertained and amused - you'll also be taught the sophisticated, wary, and profitable approaches to playing the markets that you need to be a successful investor today. Among the subjects explored: how to choose a trustworthy broker ... and when even trustworthy brokers cannot be trusted; why stock market averages can be misleading, and what you should really look for in analyzing market performance; how to tell if your money is really working; why you should beware of companies that overpromote; how to balance investment risks against investment opportunity and figure out how much risk is too much for you; why investment charts have a way of appearing most convincing just as they are about to change direction; how to quickly spot misleading Wall Street euphemisms and sweeping Wall Street generalities, and avoid being taken in by either; how to stop focusing on stock market minutiae and concentrate on the \"big picture\"; plus advice on the ins and outs of portfolio turnover and diversification ... the \"fine print\" in annual reports ... stock splits ... mergers and acquisitions ... the laws of supply and demand ... and much more.Featuring the perfect blend of wit and wisdom as well as a 10-page stock selection guide, \"It's a Sure Thing\" sounds a welcome call for a much-needed return to plain common sense in equity investing.",

        "Description": "In the aftermath of civil war, the world of the atevi is still perilously unstable. Tabini-aiji, powerful ruler of the Western Association, along with his son and heir, and his human paidhi, Bren Cameron, have returned to the Bu-javid, their seat of power. The usurper, Murini, has escaped to the lands of his supporters, but the danger these rebels pose is far from over. The world of the atevi has fragmented into two antagonistic political camps: the forward-thinking, pro-space, open-to-change Western Association, headed by Tabini, and the forces of traditional East: anti-space, opposed to change, distrustful of humans. Ilisidi, Tabini's grandmother, the aiji-dowager, has returned to her ancient castle in the East, for though she supports the rule of her grandson, she also has powerful ties in the lands of the rebels, and seeks to muster whatever support she can from among those enemy strongholds.In the heavily armed and tightly guarded Bu-javid, eight-year-old Cajeiri is horribly bored. The last two years of his life have been more fascinating than most children could imagine. Two years on an interstellar starship, surrounded by human children, a completely different environment, different culture, different mindset, new and different concepts and experiences, have left him craving excitement and the company of his peers - both human and atevi. Even Bren is too busy to spend much time with him. At loose ends and feeling deserted, Cajeiri resorts to playing pranks and causing mischief - two thing for which the already tense leaders at the Bu-javid have little patience.But unbeknownst to this dissatisfied youngster he has become a target for forces bent on destroying his father's rule and everything it stands for. There are those who are committed to ensuring that Cajeiri never lives to inherit the power his father now wields. Though still a child, Cajeiri embodies a unique threat to the venerable, tradition-defined lifestyle of his people. For this innocent young boy is the first atevi youth to have lived in a human environment, surrounded by human children. And after hundreds of years of fragile, tenuous atevi-human coexistence, Cajeiri may very well be the first atevi to ever truly understand the so similar yet so dangerously different aliens who share his home planet and threaten the hidebound customs of his race.",

        "Description": "\u201cAs a little boy, I had a dream that my father had taken me to the woods where there was a dead body. He buried it and told me I must never tell. It was the only thing we\u2019d ever done together as father and son, and I promised not to tell. But unlike most dreams, the memory of this one never left me. And sometimes\u2026I wasn\u2019t altogether sure about one thing: was it just a dream?\u201dWhen Augusten Burroughs was small, his father was a shadowy presence in his life: a form on the stairs, a cough from the basement, a silent figure smoking a cigarette in the dark. As Augusten grew older, something sinister within his father began to unfurl.  Something dark and secretive that could not be named.  Betrayal after shocking betrayal ensued, and Augusten\u2019s childhood was over. The kind of father he wanted didn\u2019t exist for him. This father was distant, aloof, uninterested\u2026And then the \u201cgames\u201d began. With A Wolf at the Table, Augusten Burroughs makes a quantum leap into untapped emotional terrain: the radical pendulum swing between love and hate, the unspeakably terrifying relationship between father and son. Told with scorching honesty and penetrating insight, it is a story for anyone who has ever longed for unconditional love from a parent. Though harrowing and brutal, A Wolf at the Table will ultimately leave you buoyed with the profound joy of simply being alive. It\u2019s a memoir of stunning psychological cruelty and the redemptive power of hope.",

In New York Times bestsellers such as Dance with Me, Beach Girls, and The Secret Hour, she vividly captures the dramas that make all the difference in love and families. Now, revisiting the remarkable characters introduced in her bestselling Summer\u2019s Child, she brings full circle one of her most compelling explorations of the human heart\u2026all the many ways it can be broken\u2026and the magic that can make it whole again.Their lives were a tapestry woven together by love and loss, tragedy and hope. On the windswept coast of Nova Scotia, Lily and her eight-year-old daughter, Rose, are struggling to embrace a new life even as Lily tries to let go of painful memories of the past. Among the lives that will touch theirs are those of Liam Neill, a dedicated teacher living in self-imposed isolation; Maeve Jameson, mourning the loss of a granddaughter she devoted her life to protecting; and Mark Murphy, a dogged police detective obsessed with a woman who vanished years ago\u2013who may or may not have found what he seeks in a tiny, out-of-the-way maritime village.During this eventful summer of roses, the paths\u2013and fates\u2013of these unforgettable characters will intersect in ways that none of them could ever expect\u2013and shape a future none of them could possibly foresee. For each of them it will be a time of renewal and transformation that will circle inevitably to a past left behind, a mystery unsolved, and a love reclaimed. Summer of Roses is vintage Luanne Rice\u2013a novel that celebrates the ties of family, the passion of lovers, and the deep, unbreakable bonds that hold us together through all the seasons of our lives.",

Anthony Robinson here makes a significant -- and in many ways unique -- contribution to this discussion by bringing his personal insights as a pastor to bear on the issue of renewing congregational life.Writing from twenty-five years of experience in four congregations of differing size, location, and ethnic makeup, Robinson prescribes concrete changes in the practice of ministry that have been tried, tested, and lived out to great success. At the heart of his framework for church renewal is what he calls \"cultural change.\" According to Robinson, technical or programmatic change is not sufficient to address the needs of the day. He argues for changing the veryculture of mainline congregations, which involves recognizing and fostering their particular gifts and genius rather than trying to remake them into something they are not. His fruitful strategies for renewal touch every aspect of congregational life, from personal spiritual formation to church leadership.",

        "Description": "The Brookings Institution has long produced an analysis of America's defense budgets and policies. The war on terror and the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have forced upon this country soaring defense budgets and unprecedented challenges in policymaking. In the newest installment in this tradition, leading foreign policy expert Michael O'Hanlon offers policy recommendations for strengthening the ability of America's military to respond to international crises in a tumultuous world.  The United States can, for the foreseeable future, be confident that its armed forces will remain engaged in Iraq, as well as in Afghanistan and other theaters in the war on terror. It will also need to remain involved in deterrence missions in the western Pacific, most notably in Korea and the Taiwan Strait. It will wish to remain engaged in European security, since the capabilities and cohesion of the NATO alliance have important implications for the United States globally.  O'Hanlon reviews these priorities, asking tough questions and developing frameworks for answering them:  &#149; What military will the United States need in the future?  &#149; How much will it cost?  &#149; How can the U.S. increase the size of its ground forces without increasing the size of the defense budget?  &#149; In an era of apocalyptic terror threats, and at a time of $400 billion defense budgets and $400 billion federal budget deficits, how can this country protect its citizens while maintaining fiscal responsibility?",

Young women live by feminism's goals, yet feminism itself is undeniably at a crossroads; \"girl power\" feminists appear to be obsessed with personal empowerment at the expense of politics while political institutions such as Ms. and NOW are so battle weary they've lost their ability to speak to a new generation. In Manifesta, Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards show the snags in each feminist hub--from the dissolution of riot grrrls into the likes of the Spice Girls, to older women's hawking of young girls' imperiled self-esteem, to the hyped hatred of feminist thorns like Katie Roiphe and Naomi Wolf--and prove that these snags have not, in fact, torn feminism asunder. In an intelligent and incendiary argument, Baumgardner and Richards address issues instead of feelings and the political as well as the personal. They describe the seven deadly sins the media commits against feminism, provide keys to accessible and urgent activism, discuss why the ERA is still a relevant and crucial political goal, and spell out what a world with equality would look like. They apply Third Wave confidence to Second Wave consciousness, all the while maintaining that the answer to feminism's problems is still feminism.",

        "Description": "A classic work on gender culture exploring how the women\u2019s movement has evolved to Girls Gone Wild in a new, self-imposed chauvinism. In the tradition of Susan Faludi\u2019s Backlash and Naomi Wolf\u2019s The Beauty Myth, New York Magazine writer Ariel Levy studies the effects of modern feminism on women today.Meet the Female Chauvinist Pig\u2014the new brand of \u201cempowered woman\u201d who wears the Playboy bunny as a talisman, bares all for Girls Gone Wild, pursues casual sex as if it were a sport, and embraces \u201craunch culture\u201d wherever she finds it. If male chauvinist pigs of years past thought of women as pieces of meat, Female Chauvinist Pigs of today are doing them one better, making sex objects of other women\u2014and of themselves. They think they\u2019re being brave, they think they\u2019re being funny, but in Female Chauvinist Pigs, Ariel Levy asks if the joke is on them.  In her quest to uncover why this is happening, Levy interviews college women who flash for the cameras on spring break and teens raised on Paris Hilton and breast implants. She examines a culture in which every music video seems to feature a stripper on a pole, the memoirs of porn stars are climbing the bestseller lists, Olympic athletes parade their Brazilian bikini waxes in the pages of Playboy, and thongs are marketed to prepubescent girls. Levy meets the high-powered women who create raunch culture\u2014the new oinking women warriors of the corporate and entertainment worlds who eagerly defend their efforts to be \u201cone of the guys.\u201d And she traces the history of this trend back to conflicts between the women\u2019s movement and the sexual revolution long left unresolved.  Levy pulls apart the myth of the Female Chauvinist Pig and argues that what has come to pass for liberating rebellion is actually a kind of limiting conformity. Irresistibly witty and wickedly intelligent, Female Chauvinist Pigs makes the case that the rise of raunch does not represent how far women have come, it only proves how far they have left to go.",
