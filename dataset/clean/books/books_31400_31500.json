        "Description": "A Tribute to Those Who Love, Nurture, and InspireTo most of us, our grandma and grandpa are special people who have nurtured us from childhood into adulthood.  A warm hug, freely given cookies and candy, a chance to stay up past bedtime are special memories that only our grandparents have given us.Today's grandparents are just as likely to serve chicken nuggets as chicken soup and teach a computer game instead of a card game. Still, grandparents are always different from parents, allowed to spoil a child with the special love they give.Grandparents Are Special is a loving tribute to those who seem to nurture with great patience, a celebration of the unique role grandparents play in our lives.  Filled with anecdotes, poems, and quotes, this book is a perfect gift to those very special people.",

        "Authors": "By Ridley, Matt",
        "Description": "Following his highly praised and bestselling book Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters, Matt Ridley has written a brilliant and profound book about the roots of human behavior. Nature via Nurture explores the complex and endlessly intriguing question of what makes us who we are.   In February 2001 it was announced that the human genome contains not 100,000 genes, as originally postulated, but only 30,000. This startling revision led some scientists to conclude that there are simply not enough human genes to account for all the different ways people behave: we must be made by nurture, not nature. Yet again biology was to be stretched on the Procrustean bed of the nature-nurture debate. Matt Ridley argues that the emerging truth is far more interesting than this myth. Nurture depends on genes, too, and genes need nurture. Genes not only predetermine the broad structure of the brain, they also absorb formative experiences, react to social cues, and even run memory. They are consequences as well as causes of the will.   Published fifty years after the discovery of the double helix of DNA, Nature via Nurture chronicles a revolution in our understanding of genes. Ridley recounts the hundred years' war between the partisans of nature and nurture to explain how this paradoxical creature, the human being, can be simultaneously free-willed and motivated by instinct and culture. Nature via Nurture is an enthralling,up-to-the-minute account of how genes build brains to absorb experience.",

What We Saw follows a day that started out like any other but ended in silence and sorrow -- from the first interviews by phone with eyewitnesses to a plane crashing into Tower 1 of the World Trade Center to the Towers of Light tribute, six months later.  As the world came to a halt that September morning, Dan Rather and his colleagues at CBS News worked tirelessly to provide detailed, accurate coverage of that day and the days that followed. Not only are the events that shook America's biggest city and its capital closely documented, but the tragedies that occurred elsewhere are also examined, from the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to the repercussions felt in a small New Jersey commuter town. Among the contributors are Jules Naudet, a French filmmaker who was working on a documentary about New York City firefighters when his subjects were called into service that September morning; Newsweek's Anna Quindlen, whose thoughts turn to a young family likely headed on vacation aboard United Airlines Flight 175, The New Republic's David Grann, who captures the feeling of hopelessness felt by the families searching for missing loved ones; and CBS's Ed Bradley, who describes the volunteers who flocked to Manhattan with an overwhelming desire to help.  Each moment of September 11 and its aftermath is portrayed with candor and honesty by the CBS News correspondents, photographers, camera operators, and journalists who were there. What We Saw is an invaluable documentary of a day that changed our world forever.",

        "Title": "Christianity On Trial: Arguments Against Anti-Religious Bigotry",
        "Authors": "By Carroll, Vincent and Shiflett, Dave",
        "Description": "In \"Christianity on Trial,\" Vincent Carroll and David Shiflett do not shrink from confronting the tragedies that have been perpetrated throughout the ages in the name of Christianity. But they argue that the current indulgence of anti-Christian rhetoric in our culture not only involves bad taste, but tunnel vision and willful historical illiteracy as well. Carroll and Shiflett dispassionately consider the indictment of Christianity--specifically that it has justified racism and misogyny, encouraged ignorance, and promoted the despoliation of the environment and even justified genocide. Then, in a narrative whose intellectual elegance and verve calls up comparisons to \"How the Irish Saved Civilization,\" they answer these charges, showing how in fact the Christian tradition has not only injected morality into our political order, but softened brutal practices and confining superstitions, created the foundation for intellectual inquiry, and created the compassionate! impulse. \"Christianity on Trial\" challenges readers of all beliefs--even those with a belief in disbelief itself--to question the anti-religious bigotry that thrives in our intellectual world and to reevaluate the role of Christianity not only as a source of consolation but of enlightenment and human liberation as well.",

        "Description": "The resurgence of ethnic consciousness over the past decade has had a profound effect on many Jewish artists, writers, performers, and the Jewish community at large. Surprisingly, however, Jewish identity remains one of the least explored terrains in contemporary discussions of multiculturalism and identity-based art.\u00a0Too Jewish?\u00a0 takes a fresh, often confrontational and sometimes humorous, approach to newly considered representations of Jewish identity. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This book, accompanied by a major exhibition at The Jewish Museum, New York, places the Jewish identity subjects in the recent art of such artists as Deborah Kass, Rona Pondick, Archie Rand, Elaine Reichek, Art Spiegelman, Hannah Wilke, and others within a larger continuum of influences ranging from nineteenth-century art history to twentieth-century media and pop culture. Essays by major writers explore the historic and scientific roots of the construction of the Jew's \"otherness,\u201d assimilation strategies, and stereotypes inherent in past and present definitions of Jewish masculinity and femininity. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The contributors include cultural critic\u00a0Maurice Berger,\u00a0sociologist\u00a0Sander L.

Now the revision to the compact, perennial bestseller includes a provocative new concluding chapter depicting God asking a believer questions about his stewardship over material resources. Jesus spent more time talking about money and possessions than about heaven and hell combined. But too often we\u2019ve overlooked or misunderstood his most profound teaching on this topic, from his words in Matthew 6. Jesus offers us life-changing investment advice. He actually wants us to store up treasures for ourselves\u2014just not here on earth. Instead, he urges us to store our treasure in heaven, where they will await us, and last forever. We can\u2019t take it with us\u2014but we can send it on ahead!Readers are moved from the realms of thoughtful Bible exposition into the highly personal arena of everyday life. Because when Jesus told His followers to \u201clay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,\u201d He intended that they discover an astounding secret: how joyful giving brings God maximum glory and His children maximum pleasure. In\u00a0The Treasure Principle,\u00a0you\u2019ll unearth a radical teaching of Jesus\u2014a secret wrapped up in giving. Once you discover this secret, life will never look the same. And you won\u2019t want it to be.\u00a0\u201cSupercharged with stunning, divine truth!

Each of the more than 500 true stories of unsurpassed stupidity falls within an appropriately defined category, such as \"Dumb Happens,\" \"How the Dumb Live,\" \"Mensa Rejects,\" and \"Dumb with Attitude.\" You will marvel at such epic acts of dopiness as the farm worker whose toothache drove him to fire a pistol into his mouth; the prison inmates who drove nails into their heads to avoid hard labor; the police officer who was suspended for crossing his sevens; the man in China who kept a 66-mm antitank rocket on his TV as a \"knick-knack\"; the psychiatrist whose patients drove him nuts; and the young Illinois woman who got lost while job hunting - and ended up in Maine.",

        "Description": "There\u2019s little question that he actually lived. But miracles? Rising from the dead? Some of the stories you hear about him sound like just that--stories. A reasonable person would never believe them, let alone the claim that he\u2019s the only way to God! But a reasonable person would also make sure that he or she understood the facts before jumping to conclusions. That\u2019s why Lee Strobel--an award-winning legal journalist with a knack for asking tough questions--decided to investigate Jesus for himself. An atheist, Strobel felt certain his findings would bring Christianity\u2019s claims about Jesus tumbling down like a house of cards. He was in for the surprise of his life. Join him as he retraces his journey from skepticism to faith. You\u2019ll consult expert testimony as you sift through the truths that history, science, psychiatry, literature, and religion reveal. Like Strobel, you\u2019ll be amazed at the evidence--how much there is, how strong it is, and what it says. The facts are in. What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ?",

Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of Salon.com's popular column, \"Ask the Pilot,\" unravels the secrets and tells you all there is to know about the strange and fascinating world of commercial flight.

Seldom out of the newspapers, always in the news, the Princess used her sudden celebrity to fight for the causes she believed in - for the better understanding of Aids patients; against the use of landmines, where the devastation they wreak can be felt decades after they are put in place; for the care of terminally ill children, most particularly at the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital; these and hundreds of other causes benefited from her care and love.Now, as a nation and the world pay their final respects with an intensity of feeling rarely experienced, Diana, Princess of Wales: A Tribute documents in an intimate portrait the making of a legend.",

Morality plays provided moral instruction, their principal characters vivid personifications of virtue and vice.

        "Title": "Why Freedom Matters: Celebrating the Declaration of Independence in Two Centuries of Prose, Poetry and Song",
        "Authors": "By Katz, Daniel R. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Freedom. It's an idea worth pledging a life for, in the words of Thomas Jefferson. A gift outright to the poet Robert Frost. A difficult responsibility, writes Frederick Douglass. Defiant and enduring, for Maya Angelou. Quarrelsome, to Kurt Vonnegut. Open-armed and welcoming-Emma Lazarus.Why Freedom Matters celebrates freedom in over 100 speeches, letters, essays, poems, and songs, all infused with the spirit of democracy. Here are the voices of presidents and slaves, founding fathers and hip-hop artists, suffragettes, civil rights workers, preachers, labor leaders, and baseball players. Inspired by the Declaration of Independence, the book is published in conjunction with The Declaration of Independence Road Trip, a 31/2-year cross-country educational tour of an extremely rare, original hand-printed copy of the Declaration, bought at auction by Norman Lear. The DOI Road Trip's mission is to energize Americans by bringing our founding document to towns small and large across the country; in 2003, for example, the Declaration and its accompanying exhibit will visit 27 cities from Birmingham to Billings, New Orleans to New York. Like the document itself, this compelling anthology reveals America's soul as it wrestles with questions of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and strives to fulfill the ideals of Thomas Jefferson's words.",

But his all-consuming quest for more ultimately led to a divorce, estrangement from his children, and a crisis of faith in himself and the value of his life. Then-in a bitter twist of fate-he lost the business that he'd worked so relentlessly to build.  Today, John has committed himself to the pursuit of success with significance. In changing the priorities of his own life, he developed and codified the Daily Six-six principles that provide a bridge between career success and personal well-being, and that have become the cornerstone of his corporate and personal consulting work. Now, he shares his 6-part program for individuals looking to jump-start positive change and to find balance between their personal and professional lives.",

Is she an impostor in her own life? she asks herself. Is it indeed her own life? Or is it someone else\u2019s?On the surface, Beck, as she is known to the Davitch clan, is outgoing, joyous, a natural celebrator. Giving parties is, after all, her vocation\u2014something she slipped into even before finishing college, when Joe Davitch spotted her at an engagement party in his family\u2019s crumbling nineteenth-century Baltimore row house, where giving parties was the family business. What caught his fancy was that she seemed to be having such a wonderful time. Soon this large-spirited older man, a divorc\u00e9 with three little girls, swept her into his orbit, and before she knew it she was embracing his extended family plus a child of their own, and hosting endless parties in the ornate, high-ceilinged rooms of The Open Arms. Now, some thirty years later, after presiding over a disastrous family picnic, Rebecca is caught un-awares by the question of who she really is. How she answers it\u2014how she tries to recover her girlhood self, that dignified grownup she had once been\u2014is the story told in this beguiling, funny, and deeply moving novel.As always with Anne Tyler\u2019s novels, once we enter her world it is hard to leave. But in Back When We Were Grownups she so sharpens our perceptions and awakens so many untapped feelings that we come away not only refreshed and delighted, but also infinitely wiser.",

        "Title": "Beyond Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness",
        "Authors": "By Kass, Leon R. (FRW)",
        "Description": "A groundbreaking new exploration of the promises and perils of biotechnology -- and the future of American society.Biotechnology offers exciting prospects for healing the sick and relieving suffering. But because our growing powers also enable alterations in the workings of the body and mind, they are becoming attractive to healthy people who would just like to look younger, perform better, feel happier, or become more \"perfect.\"This landmark book -- the product of more than sixteen months of research and reflection by the members of the President's Council on Bioethics -- explores the profound ethical and social consequences of today's biotechnical revolution. Almost every week brings news of novel methods for screening genes and testing embryos, choosing the sex and modifying the behavior of children, enhancing athletic performance, slowing aging, blunting painful memories, brightening mood, and altering basic temperaments. But we must not neglect the fundamental question: Should we be turning to biotechnology to fulfill our deepest human desires?We want better children -- but not by turning procreation into manufacture or by altering their brains to gain them an edge over their peers. We want to perform better in the activities of life -- but not by becoming mere creatures of chemistry. We want longer lives -- but not at the cost of becoming so obsessed with our own longevity that we care little about future generations. We want to be happy -- but not by taking a drug that gives us happy feelings without the genuine loves, attachments, and achievements that are essential to true human flourishing. As we enjoy the benefits of biotechnology, members of the council contend, we need to hold fast to an account of the human being seen not in material or mechanistic or medical terms but in psychic, moral, and spiritual ones. By grasping the limits of our new powers, we can savor the fruits of the age of biotechnology without succumbing to its most dangerous temptations.Beyond Therapy takes these issues out of the narrow circle of bioethics professionals and into the larger public arena, where matters of this importance rightly belong.",
