        "Description": "Sylvia Ann Hewlett, noted feminist scholar and child advocate, and Cornel West, Harvard philosopher and well-known human rights leader, join in a rare partnership to explore one of the most painful problem of our times. Why are hundreds of thousands of American children \"dangling and dangerous\" and millions more failing to thrive? At the heart of our children's agony is a frightening erosion of the parenting role - not because parents are less devoted than they used to be but because the whole world is stacked against them. Big business, government, and the wider culture are waging a silent war against parents, undermining the work they do. Adults raising children have been harmed by managerial greed, pounded by tax and housing policy, and invaded and degraded by the entertainment industry. In The War Against Parents, Hewlett and West present a blueprint for parent empowerment, which they call a G.I. Bill for the Twenty-first Century. United behind an agenda that spans the divides of race, gender, and class. The War Against Parents is both a visionary and an intimate book. Hewlett and West explore their childhoods -- strangely similar stories of growing up in family-centered blue-collar communities in Wales and California -- and with striking candor tell of their struggles to be a good mother and a good father in our parent-hurting society. Lending moral heft to the work parents do, Hewlett and West provide comfort and hope. There is not a parent among us who is not hungry for such healing.",

Both their careers and their courage helped prepare McCain for the biggest challenge of his life when, as a naval aviator, he was shot down over Hanoi in 1967 and seriously injured. When his captors realized McCain's impressive military legacy, they offered him early release. In what has now become a legendary act of heroism, McCain refused the offer and was subsequently tortured, held in solitary confinement, and imprisoned for more than five years.Faith of My Fathers is about what McCain learned from his father and grandfather, and how their example enabled him to survive. Told with humility, grace, and humor, it is a story of three imperfect men who faced adversity and emerged with their honor intact. It is a story to inspire and instruct, one that shows what fathers give to their sons, and what, ultimately, endures.",

But soon cracks begin to appear in the foundation of Deena and Daniel's marriage, and the values that Deena grew up with are thrown into question, along with the very notion of \"home.\"Giving Up America charts the conflict between the religious and the secular, between Hasidic and Orthodox practices, between being single and being married. It painfully juxtaposes the inner desires, expectations, and imaginings of its characters with the workaday realities and choices we all face.",

Welcome to  Blackwood Farm: soaring white columns, spacious drawing rooms, bright, sun-drenched  gardens, and a dark strip of the dense Sugar Devil Swamp. This is the world of Quinn  Blackwood, a brilliant young man haunted since birth by a mysterious doppelg\u00e4nger,  \u201cGoblin,\u201d a spirit from a dream world that Quinn can\u2019t escape and that prevents him  from belonging anywhere.

As the novel moves backwards and forwards in  time, from Quinn\u2019s boyhood on Blackwood Farm to present day New Orleans, from ancient  Athens to 19th-century Naples, Quinn seeks out the legendary Vampire Lestat in the  hope of freeing himself from the spectre that draws him inexorably back to Sugar  Devil Swamp and the explosive secrets it holds.

Jance returns with a powerful tale that explores the darkest corners of human nature, revealing the grievous injuries inflicted behind locked doors, the unseen wounds that bleed and destroy and never heal ...The heat is a killer in Cochise County, Arizona, with temperatures over 100 degrees. In the suffocating stillness of an airless trailer, a woman is lying dead, a bullet hole in her chest. Why someone would murder a harmless loner with a soft spot for stray dogs is only one of the questions  nagging at the local police; another is why the killer used an eighty-five-year-old bullet, fired from the same weapon that slaughtered two other women who were discovered bound, naked, and gruesomely posed on the remote edge of a rancher's land.The slayings are as oppressive as the blistering heat for Sheriff Joanna Brady, who must shoulder the added double burden of a brutal reelection campaign and major developments on the home front. With suddenly more on her plate than many big-city law officers have to contend with, Joanna must put marital distractions and an opponent's dirty tricks in the background and deal with the terrifying reality that now threatens everyone in her jurisdiction: a serial killer in their midst.A twisted and lethal drama is unfolding in this small corner of the southwestern desert as fear, hatred, and the evil at the core of one family's history come to a rapid boil beneath a merciless Arizona sun. Pressure mounts for Sheriff Brady personally and professionally while she pursues a sadistic murderer into the shadows of the past to get to the roots of a monstrous obsession ... and expose the permanent wounds of a crime far worse than homicide.",

They are Andrew and Janice Frost, forever giving parties; rich and successful Darcy Clegg and Hannah, his sexy young wife; Vicky and Gordon Ransome, expecting their third child; libidinous Jimmy Rose and Star, his enigmatic wife; and Michael Wickham, married to Marcelle, a woman as complex as her famous five-course meals.To Nina, they represent everything that she has lost: love, safety, children, companionship. But then she is drawn to one of the men, and their passionate affair ignites a series of infidelities that reveals the cracks beneath the apparently smooth surfaces of these marriages. Over the course of a year, each pair is forced to renegotiate the terms of their relationship. No one emerges unscathed or unchanged. Nina herself is in for a shock: The marriage that she mourns, that she saw as perfect, was flawed.Author Rosie Thomas's unerring eye shines a powerful spotlight on both the mundane and extraordinary moments that make up domestic life. Though the vulnerability of relationships is exposed, so, too, are the strengths of the marriage bonds, and of the bonds of friendship among women. Other People's Marriages is a powerful portrait of the vagaries of attraction, friendship, and love.",

Lovers. They are all players in a high-stakes game of power and politics only one can win. It is a race that will sweep from Texas to Massachusetts to Washington, D.C., where Ben Knight's boyhood friend - now is most formidable enemy - plots his downfall.

        "Description": "One of the most exciting best-sellers in recent memory was Ralph Emery's Memories, the autobiography of the popular host of TNN's Nashville Now. Across the country, fans made the book a phenomenal success, keeping it high on the New York Times best-seller list for six months.The reason was simple: people love Ralph Emery and his wonderful recollections about the world of country music. And now Emery, who over the course of forty years in broadcasting has come to know and launch a thousand country stars, among them Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and Barbara Mandrell, picks up where Memories left off.Emery himself says his first book drew on less than one percent of his memories of his years on television. With More Memories, he takes readers backstage and into the limelight with tales about dozens of top stars, including Willie Nelson, Jimmy Dean, Reba McEntire, Roger Miller, Porter Wagoner, Glen Campbell, George Jones, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Garth Brooks, and many, many more. Readers will travel the same roads these stars have traveled: roads of happiness, despair, excess, recovery, estrangement, and reconciliation. Their stories are at once harrowing, funny, inspiring, and heartwarming.Within these pages, Emery uncovers new facts - and mysteries - surrounding the death of Patsy Cline; reveals how the Grammy Awards Show ended up in Nashville one year, and why it may never return there again; explains why a square-dance call during a Bob Wills show in Texas mortified the local gentry; and relates the visit of Roy Acuff's ghost to the TNN offices. And those are just a few of the memories Emery shares.Illustrated with many never-before-seen photographs, More Memories offers a wealth of enjoyment for readers and fans everywhere.",

But as this story developed, a message began to emerge that I had not foreseen, a message about the distorted mirror in which we view ourselves, binding ourselves with shackles of self-doubt and fear.  The Looking Glass is aptly named, for it is about seeing the reality of ourselves: to see a true reflection of who we are.  It is the story of Hunter Bell, a Presbyterian minister turned gambler, and the founder of a gold camp named Bethel. (Which you may remember was Esther's hometown in The Locket.) He is running from the bitter memories of his past, his ministry, and ultimately, from his God.  Venturing into a blizzard to chase away wolves drawn close to his cabin by hunger, Hunter finds a beautiful young woman in the snow, wounded by the wolves and half dead with the cold. Her name is Quaye McGandley, and she is an Irish woman sold into marital slavery to a brutal husband who then brought her to America against her will. As Hunter nurses her back to health, he finds that his tender ministrations to Quaye have opened his heart to his greatest fear -- that he might love again.  It is my hope that you, and those with whom you share my book, might through its message better see the divinity within yourself and the reality of who you are: worthy of love, gentleness, and grace.

Their goal was to explore the role of the CEO - to discover how the men and women at the pinnacle of some of the world's most prominent companies fulfill their role as leaders. They came away not with abstract theories about management but with real stories about how CEOs actually spend their days, whom they see, where they go, which decisions they make, which they don't, and why. In the process, the authors uncovered new and provocative evidence that there exist five distinct styles of leadership. In Maximum Leadership they illustrate those styles - or \"approaches,\" as they call themwith vivid examples and the candid voices of CEOs at companies such as Coca-Cola, Gillette, Nintendo, Hewlett-Packard, Goldman Sachs, and Nestle.",

Based on exciting new scientific findings from leading institutions, Stop Aging Now! reveals the stunning truth: Much of what we call aging is not inevitable, but is needless and can be prevented and reversed to a startling degree by supplements and foods. Indeed, aging is often due to unsuspected deficiencies that can be readily corrected, and even people in their sixties, seventies and eighties can turn back the clock and recover their youth. Leading scientists have found that: Vitamins can prevent and reverse memory loss and other signs of aging. Vitamins and minerals can rejuvenate immune functions, restoring youthful resistance to infections and cancer. Antioxidants in foods and supplements can help prevent clogged arteries, heart attacks and general bodily deterioration. Many unfamiliar but readily available food chemicals can prolong life and preserve your vitality.",

        "Title": "Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life with Alzheimer's",
        "Authors": "By Debaggio, Thomas",
        "Description": "When Tom DeBaggio turned fifty-seven in 1999, he thought he was about to embark on the relaxing golden years of retirement -- time to spend with his family, his friends, the herb garden he had spent decades cultivating and from which he made a living. Then, one winter day, he mentioned to his doctor during a routine exam that he had been stumbling into forgetfulness, making his work difficult. After that fateful visit, and a subsequent battery of tests over several months, DeBaggio joined the legion of twelve million others afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. But under such a curse, DeBaggio was also given one of the greatest gifts: the ability to chart the ups and downs of his own failing mind. Losing My Mind is an extraordinary first-person account of early onset Alzheimer's -- the form of the disease that ravages younger, more alert minds. DeBaggio started writing on the first day of his diagnosis and has continued despite his slipping grasp on one of life's greatest treasures, memory.  In an inspiring and detailed account, DeBaggio paints a vivid picture of the splendor of memory and the pain that comes from its loss. Whether describing the happy days of a youth spent in a much more innocent time or evaluating how his disease has affected those around him, DeBaggio poignantly depicts one of the most important parts of our lives -- remembrance -- and how we often take it for granted. But to DeBaggio, memory is more than just an account of a time long past, it is one's ability to function, to think, and ultimately, to survive. As his life becomes reduced to moments of clarity, the true power of thought and his ability to connect to the world shine through, and in DeBaggio's case, it is as much in the lack of functioning as it is in the ability to function that one finds love, hope and the relaxing golden years of peace.  At once an autobiography, a medical history and a testament to the beauty of memory, Losing My Mind is more than just a story of Alzheimer's, it is the captivating tale of one man's battle to stay connected with the world and his own life.",

Passing through his lobby at all hours of the night and day is an exotic cross-section of the world's population: an Egyptian-born plastic surgeon who lives on the fifth floor and specializes in gender reassignment; a fighter pilot, on the eighth floor, who flew for Nazi Germany during World War II; an Iraqi spice merchant and the world-famous crazy-patch quilter with whom he's having an affair; the adulterer's son, dreaming of becoming an undertaker; and the widow whose apartment is a jungle Eden filled with a menagerie of specimens -- finches, canaries, a defanged cobra, a monkey named Joe -- that had been the subject of her dead husband's research.Farro Fescu knows them all, knows all their secrets. He knows what happened to Yesenia Rivera, the nineteen-year-old staff housekeeper from Queens, when she took a fateful ride one evening on the Staten Island Ferry. He alone knows the truth behind the mysterious mishap that befell the fashion designer Ira Klempp, a resident of the twelfth floor. And he knows -- and would like to know much more -- about the alluring Mar\u00eda Gracia Mo\u00f1o, sometime lover of Harry Falcon, the brilliant captain of industry who lives in the penthouse and is dying of cancer.He is keenly attuned to the building and the people in it, yet he does not know what is in his own heart -- why, after a long, hard life, he is still alive, and still alone. Nor does he know what he will be capable of in the face of sudden, overwhelming tragedy.As the narrative eye of Between Two Rivers floats from one apartment to another, revealing the characters' private histories and tracing the dramatic intersections of their daily lives, a lush tapestry of experience emerges. The story, in beautifully textured prose, is laced with wit and humor, subtle ironies and haunting echoes, and everywhere a profound sense of the resilience of the human spirit.",

        "Description": "It is a symbol of unity and a subject of controversy. It can be found in the depths of the Earth's oceans and on the rocky surface of the moon. It is our flag -- the Stars and Stripes -- a swath of red, white, and blue that represents America's past and its present . . . and inspires its future. In this moving and informative volume, Richard H. Schneider, the author of the acclaimed Taps: Notes from a Nation's Heart and Freedom's Holy Light: The Statue of Liberty, delivers an intriguing history and a powerful tribute to our flag.   Stars & Stripes Forever unfurls the colorful story of this enduring emblem of our national identity, culture, and spirit, from its humble origins more than two hundred years ago to its significance in the twenty-first century. Combining history and legend, fact and lore, Schneider relates how the flag has evolved -- through war and peace, through changing times and honored traditions -- and sets the record straight on many widely held misconceptions.   There are many entertaining and enlightening stories, including that of the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key's \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"; the flag that was stained by Lincoln's blood at Ford's Theater in 1888; and the flag raised at Ground Zero amid the wreckage of the World Trade Center. In addition to historical facts and little-known lore, he offers heartfelt recollections from celebrities and ordinary citizens alike whose lives have been indelibly touched by Old Glory.   Sure to speak to the patriot in us all, Stars & Stripes Forever tells a story that is as remarkable and diverse as America itself.",

Regardless of the time and place these women were born each excelled in her respective field, making it easier for the next generation. This is what makes them heroines.In American Heroines, Kay Bailey Hutchison presents female pioneers in fields as varied as government, business, education and healthcare, who overcame the resistance and prejudice of their times and accomplished things that no woman\u2014and sometimes no man -- had done before. Hutchison, a pioneer in her own right, became the first woman elected to the United States Senate from the State of Texas. Interspersed with the stories of America's historic female leaders are stories of today\u2019s women whose successes are clearly linked to those predecessors. Would Sally Ride have been given the chance to orbit the earth had Amelia Earhart not flown solo across the Atlantic Ocean fifty years before? Had Clara Barton not nursed wounded soldiers on Civil War battlefields, aid may not have reached the millions it did while the Red Cross was in the hands of women like Elizabeth Dole and Bernadine Healy. Had Oveta Culp Hobby not been appointed the first Secretary of the Department of Health and Education by President Eisenhower, the country may have been deprived of such leaders as Secretary of State Madeline Albright and National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice.As a young girl, Senator Hutchison dreamed of an America where the qualifier \"the first woman\" had become obsolete. The profiles contained in American Heroines, illustrate how her dream is coming true, one courageous step at a time.",
