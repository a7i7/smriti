        "Description": "My lady, Fiammetta Bianchini, was plucking her eyebrows and biting color into her lips when the unthinkable happened and the Holy Roman Emperor\u2019s army blew a hole in the wall of God\u2019s eternal city, letting in a flood of half-starved, half-crazed troops bent on pillage and punishment.Thus begins In the Company of the Courtesan, Sarah Dunant\u2019s epic novel of life in Renaissance Italy. Escaping the sack of Rome in 1527, with their stomachs churning on the jewels they have swallowed, the courtesan Fiammetta and her dwarf companion, Bucino, head for Venice, the shimmering city born out of water to become a miracle of east-west trade: rich and rancid, pious and profitable, beautiful and squalid. With a mix of courage and cunning they infiltrate Venetian society. Together they make the perfect partnership: the sharp-tongued, sharp-witted dwarf, and his vibrant mistress, trained from birth to charm, entertain, and satisfy men who have the money to support her. Yet as their fortunes rise, this perfect partnership comes under threat, from the searing passion of a lover who wants more than his allotted nights to the attentions of an admiring Turk in search of human novelties for his sultan\u2019s court. But Fiammetta and Bucino\u2019s greatest challenge comes from a young crippled woman, a blind healer who insinuates herself into their lives and hearts with devastating consequences for them all.A story of desire and deception, sin and religion, loyalty and friendship, In the Company of the Courtesan paints a portrait of one of the world\u2019s greatest cities at its most potent moment in history: It is a picture that remains vivid long after the final page.",

Schlesinger, Jr., continues in his many books and articles to show Americans who we are as a nation, to explain our past, and to illuminate possibilities for the future. But here, in the first volume of his long-awaited memoirs, he turns his acute historian's eye on his own past. In the elegant and witty language of one of our most readable writers, Schlesinger artfully reconstructs a twentieth-century life.Schlesinger's personal story is ultimately the captivating history of America coming into its own as a world power. It includes a fondly remembered childhood in the Midwest; life in America of the twenties; student days at Harvard, lived in the shadow of a distinguished father; Cambridge University in England in the twilight year between the Munich Pact and the start of World War II; the bitter debate in the United States in the months before Pearl Harbor; a stint overseas with the Office of Strategic Services; the fate of postwar liberalism, under attack from right and left; the origins of The Vital Center. Here is a dramatic evocation of the struggles, the questions, the paradoxes, and the triumphs that shaped our era.Interweaving personal and national stories, Schlesinger conjures up the colorful details of everyday life, offering readers a rare and revealing window on both the private world of a notable American writer and the innocent beginnings of the American century. A LIFE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: INNOCENT BEGINNINGS, 1917 -- 1950 is destined to become a classic.",

        "Authors": "By Schmidt, Leigh Eric",
        "Description": "Yoga classes and Zen meditation, New Age seminars and holistic workshops, the Oprah Winfrey Show, and books by Deepak Chopra -- all are part of the religious experimentation that has surprisingly deep roots in American history. In fact, they represent only the most recent flowerings of a unique form of spirituality. By tracing our spiritual heritage along its many colorful highways and eccentric byways, Restless Souls profiles a rich spirituality that is distinctively American. Since the 1960s, our expanded and enhanced spiritual explorations have changed us from a nation of church goers into a culture of seekers. But the American fascination with mystical experience and churchless spirituality goes back much further than the psychedelic era. In Restless Souls, historian Leigh Schmidt deftly traces this American romance with the interior life from the likes of transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson to television host Oprah Winfrey, from poet Walt Whitman to Senator Barak Obama, from questing psychologist William James to Zen basketball coach Phil Jackson. We're taken from pioneer Johnny Appleseed to translator of Sufi poetry Coleman Barks, from theosophist Madame Blavatsky to meditation guru Ram Dass, and then to many more. This book places the most recent spiritual upsurge in the context of a broader cultural and intellectual history. In contrast to prevailing fears about the conservative influence of religion in America, Restless Souls depicts a vibrantly open American spirituality and serves as a timely reminder of the ample religious resources of the liberal tradition.",

        "Title": "You Must Be Dreaming",
        "Authors": "By Noel, Barbara",
        "Description": "When Barbara Noel first went to Dr. Jules Masserman, he predicted she'd be cured of her performance anxiety within two years. But after six months, he injected her with a barbiturate to help her \"overcome her resistance to the truth\" of what was bothering her. He gave her that drug for the next eighteen years - until the harrowing day she awakened from a drugged sleep to find herself being raped by the man she trusted most.This spellbinding, chilling story tells how a bright, articulate woman spent years under the sway of the cunning psychiatrist who used her for his sexual purposes. Step by riveting step, in a series of revelations about the secret lives of both doctor and patient, Barbara Noel relives her battle to understand herself and to bring Dr. Jules Masserman to justice for his sexual and ethical betrayals.It wasn't an easy battle. Jules Masserman was considered \"Psychiatry's Ambassador to the World.\" As past president of the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, as well as chairman of psychiatry at Northwestern University Medical School, he seemed invincible.But Barbara Noel wasn't alone. Jules Masserman had other accusers. Many of them. Nevertheless, Dr. Masserman still categorically denies any wrongdoing and has never been charged with a criminal offense or lost a civil suit, although his insurance company has settled out of court with several of his accusers. An exclusive interview with him is included in the Afterword of this book.From its shocking beginning to its haunting conclusion, You Must Be Dreaming is a suspenseful journey into the psyche of a young woman who fell victim to the hidden, twisted heart of a brilliant and charming man. It is also an important and critical expose of one of medicine's darkest secrets - the rogue doctor who holds raw power over patients he considers little more than human guinea pigs.",

But when Dan Dye reached her, she struggled to her feet like a clumsy foal, raised her forehead to his, and announced, as clearly as if she had actually spoken the words, You know I'm the one. Now get me outta here! By turns funny, moving, tender, and inspiring, Gracie's tale is a treat for every dog lover. There is Gracie's first morning, racing around Dan in the snowy yard. Gracie's first determination to prove to her step-sisters, Dottie the Dalmation and Sarah the Black Lab, that she's one of the girls. Gracie's defiant romance with a pint-size charmer named Byron, a Boston Terrier from the wrong side of the fence. Then born of necessity, the eureka moment: When Gracie's delicate constitution starts turning into anorexia, Dan teaches himself how to cook, and in three days is baking her the cookies that will spur her appetite, launch Three Dog Bakery, and transform their lives forever. Courage. Compassion. Kindness. Soul. Tenacity. And joy, above all, joy. These qualities Gracie possessed in abundance, and shared with everyone, human or canine, who had the good fortune to cross her path.",

        "Description": "A tale of friendship and betrayal, pragmatism and idealism, infighting and spin, the novel opens on the eve of a crucial vote on an ultra-conservative Supreme Court nominee. Senator Ellen Fischer is handed explosive documents that will surely derail the nomination she opposes - if she takes them to the floor of the Senate the next day. Her key staff members are divided: one urges her to go public, since no nomination could withstand such revelations. Another is more cautious - there are other battles to be fought, and this information cannot be verified before the vote takes place. Making matters more complex, the source of the information is Greg Hunter, a journalist with right-wing credentials. Greg is also Ellen's former lover - and the best friend of her beloved husband, Josh, whose own political career was fatally, and suspiciously, cut short.Ellen faces an ethical and practical dilemma: Say nothing, and a dangerous judge will take a seat on the highest court in the land. Speak up, and Senator Fischer's own career may be irreparably jeopardized. In coming to her decision, Ellen is forced to confront truths not just about her present and her future, but also about the mysteries of her past.From student activism on the streets of Berkeley to intrigue deep in the hideaways under the Capitol, A Time to Run is the story of one woman's unexpected rise to political prominence and the difficult choices that come with it. Barbara Boxer, writing with Mary-Rose Hayes, reveals the inner workings of the corridors of power and creates a memorable portrait of what makes people - and our government - tick.",

In a sweeping panorama of Vienna, Imperial Russia, Napoleon\u2019s France, Bismarck\u2019s Prussia, and Cavour\u2019s Italy, Crankshaw examines the ambitions and disillusionment that broke the Empire and forged the destiny of the twentieth century. \u00a0 \"A good book...a superb narrative...trenchant and witty.\" --\u00a0The New York Times \u00a0 \"Sympathetic...scholarly...humane.\" --\u00a0Sunday Times",

Sorely wounded and fatally disillusioned in the fighting at Petersburg, Inman, a Confederate soldier, decides to walk back to his home in the Blue Ridge Mountains and to Ada, the woman he loved there years before.  His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign.  At the same time, Ada is trying to revive her father's derelict farm and learn to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away.  As it interweaves their stories, Cold Mountain asserts itself as an authentic American Odyssey--hugely powerful, majestically lovely, and keenly moving.",

Eisenhower prepared a somber broadcast announcing that the enterprise had failed.    The specter of failure was always present. After a failed landing the Nazi regime would have regained the ascendant. New, terrifying bombs and rockets were ready to be launched. Long-distance submarines were in the final stage of development. The last million Jews of Europe were listed for deportation and death.    Failure at Normandy could have given Hitler the chance of continuing to rule western Europe, particularly if the United States, bloodied and defeated in Normandy, had decided-after two and a half years of focusing on Europe-to turn all its energies to the ever-growing demands of the Pacific, leaving Europe to its own devices. Had that happened, I doubt if I would have been alive to write this book, or free to express my opinions without fear of arrest.\"  --Martin Gilbert",

This is the central idea of The Essential America by George McGovern, America's best-known (and most consistent) liberal.Referring us to our moral and spiritual foundations, McGovern not only presents a resounding defense of liberalism as \"the most practical and hopeful compass to guide the American ship of state\" but offers specific proposals for keeping the tradition vibrant. The Essential America proposes programs for feeding the world's malnourished children. Rather than sending our armies abroad, McGovern spells out policies that confront the causes of terrorism. He proposes cutting our military budget (echoing Dwight D. Eisenhower's powerful warning about the military-industrial complex). He condemns preemptive war, criticizes tax cuts for the rich, and warns against government for the powerful minority. Americans have traditionally stood for progress, generosity, tolerance, and protection of the needy, McGovern states -- as well as for multi- lateralism in foreign policy and \"a decent respect for the opinions of mankind.\" He reminds us that while creative tension between liberalism and conservatism is the genius of American politics, it is the liberals who have been responsible for every forward step in our national history. They built \"the Essential America.\"",

When he is four years old, Jack travels with his mother Alice, a tattoo artist, to several North Sea ports in search of his father, William Burns. From Copenhagen to Amsterdam, William, a brilliant church organist and profligate womanizer, is always a step ahead \u2013 has always just departed in a wave of scandal, with a new tattoo somewhere on his body from a local master or \u201cscratcher.\u201dAlice and Jack abandon their quest, and Jack is educated at schools in Canada and New England \u2013 including, tellingly, a girls\u2019 school in Toronto. His real education consists of his relationships with older women \u2013 from Emma Oastler, who initiates him into erotic life, to the girls of St. Hilda\u2019s, with whom he first appears on stage, to the abusive Mrs. Machado, whom he first meets when sent to learn wrestling at a local gym. Too much happens in this expansive, eventful novel to possibly summarize it all. Emma and Jack move to Los Angeles, where Emma becomes a successful novelist and Jack a promising actor. A host of eccentric minor characters memorably come and go, including Jack\u2019s hilariously confused teacher the Wurtz; Michelle Maher, the girlfriend he will never forget; and a precocious child Jack finds in the back of an Audi in a restaurant parking lot. We learn about tattoo addiction and movie cross-dressing, \u201csleeping in the needles\u201d and the cure for cauliflower ears. And John Irving renders his protagonist\u2019s unusual rise through Hollywood with the same vivid detail and range of emotions he gives to the organ music Jack hears as a child in European churches. This is an absorbing and moving book about obsession and loss, truth and storytelling, the signs we carry on us and inside us, the traces we can\u2019t get rid of. Jack has always lived in the shadow of his absent father. But as he grows older \u2013 and when his mother dies \u2013 he starts to doubt the portrait of his father\u2019s character she painted for him when he was a child. This is the cue for a second journey around Europe in search of his father, from Edinburgh to Switzerland, towards a conclusion of great emotional force.A melancholy tale of deception, Until I Find You is also a swaggering comic novel, a giant tapestry of life\u2019s hopes. It is a masterpiece to compare with John Irving\u2019s great novels, and restates the author\u2019s claim to be considered the most glorious, comic, moving novelist at work today.",

No more than two months elapse before authorities send her off to a leprosarium on the island of Nagashima, and although it is only seven miles from her home, it is a world away from all that is familiar to her. At once, she is instructed to forget her past, to strike her name from the koseki, the family register, and ordered to choose a new name.As \"Miss Fuji\" looks around her, she sees her own future in the debilitated bodies and the lives of more than two thousand other patients. But her \"future\" never comes; her own case of leprosy remains a mild one owing to the discovery of a medicine that impedes the disease's progression in its victims. Yet she is not permitted to leave Nagashima, and over time, she wonders whether she could even survive back on the mainland. In the end, it is her constant connection to the sea and her moving encounters with those around her - a writer, a Korean storyteller, a gardener, a tanka poet, an urn painter - that give her insight into her own true nature and the deep wellspring of courage she needs to reclaim her freedom.",

        "Description": "Best known for his roles in films as varied as Lawrence of Arabia and Star Wars, Guinness is one of the most distinguishedand beloved - movie actors of his generation. His charmingly sincere diary entries offer a glimpse of the private side of his often very public life.What makes Guinness a fine and versatile actor is precisely what also makes him a good diarist: an ironically observant eye. In his diary, which covers the eighteen months from January 1995 to June 1996, he reveals the inner life of a hugely successful actor while remaining completely accessible. This work is, at the same time, a poignant account of a man coming to terms with being eighty-two and its accompanying infirmities and a delightfully humorous record of his extemporaneous opinions and careful reflections. Certain interests and preoccupations recur: theater and films, of course, but also books and paintings; the church, sometimes held up for amused observation, more often the focus of a personal faith; food and drink, whether fish 'n' chips with a group of fellow actors or a solitary entrecote at the Connaught; and the delights of being at home with his wife in the Hampshire countryside.Though Guinness shows a keen interest in contemporary events and culture (such as taking a perhaps surprising pleasure in the Wallace and Gromit cartoons), he also brings to the diary some fascinating anecdotes from his long and distinguished acting career and new tales of his current friendships.",

        "Description": "Moli\u00e8re (1622-73) combined all the traditional elements of comedy\u2014wit, slapstick, spectacle and satire\u2014with a deep understanding of character to create richly sophisticated dramas which have always delighted audiences. Most are built around dangerously deluded and obsessive heroes such as The Would-Be Gentleman and The Misanthrope who threaten to blight the lives of those around them. Such Foolish Affected Ladies and Those Learned Ladies (both newly translated for this edition) expose the extravagant, fashionable fads and snobbery of the Parisian smart set, while the story of the falsely devout Tartuffe and his devoted disciple Orgon attracted huge controversy for its attack on religious hypocrisy. Finally, The Doctor Despite Himself forms a hilarious chapter in Moli\u00e8re's long-standing vendetta against the medical profession.\u00a0Like Shakespeare, Moli\u00e8re was a true man of the theatre whose comedies blend sharp insight into human nature with an unerring sense of what would work on stage and make people laugh. All his greatest achievements are included here and in the accompanying Penguin Classics volume, The Miser and Other Plays.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.
