        "Authors": "By Pearse, Meic",
        "Description": "\"Why do they hate us so much?\"Many in the U.S. are baffled at the hatred and anti-Western sentiment they see on the international news. Why are people around the world so resentful of Western cultural values and ideals? Historian Meic Pearse unpacks the deep divides between the West and the rest of the world. He shows how many of the underlying assumptions of Western civilization directly oppose and contradict the cultural and religious values of significant people groups. Those in the Third World, Pearse says, \"have the sensation that everything they hold dear and sacred is being rolled over by an economic and cultural juggernaut that doesn?t even know it?s doing it . . . and wouldn?t understand why what it?s destroying is important or of value.\"Pearse's keen analysis offers insight into perspectives not often understood in the West, and provides a starting point for intercultural dialogue and rapprochement.",

Called output-based aid, the approach delegates service delivery to the non-profit or for profit private sector under contracts that tie payments to the outputs or results actually delivered to target beneficiaries. The book gathers cases of innovative, output-based approaches from across the infrastructure and social sectors, and also provides a checklist for designing and implementing output-based schemes.",

But once she joins the school play and becomes more involved in the news-paper, she's busier than she's ever been before -- too busy to pine for Patrick and too busy, or so Pamela and Eliza-beth think, for them. As Alice spends more time with activities that don't include Pamela and Elizabeth, they grow increasingly resentful. And Alice grows increasingly confused by their behavior.  But they aren't the only people confusing Alice. Her new friend, Faith, is seemingly incapable of ending a relationship with her abusive boyfriend. And Alice has been receiving oh-so-intriguing E-mails from an admirer...who won't sign his name. As she tries to decide whether or not to meet her mystery fan, she also watches nervously as her brother Lester's crush on his graduate school professor begins to border on obsession.  As Alice completes her first year of high school, she learns that there IS life after Patrick, and that obsessions and jealousy can affect anyone. Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has done it again with this fourteenth book in the beloved Alice series.",

        "Description": "This book is a clear, well-written manual on the craft of veneering that shows you how to turn out your own hardwood veneers beautifuly and economically, With a veneer press that you have made yourself, you can produce beautiful veneer panels that will be durable and unique. Apply them to the furniture you want to finish, and you will have veneered furniture that will look better and last longer than furniture made from \"honest lumber.\"When Paul Villiard found a way to make his own veneering equipment he opened up the craft to a wide audience. With this book you can now make your own veneer press and edger at a fraction of the cost of commercial models. Mr. Villiard also shows you all the techniques of veneering: how to match veneers; how to glue, clamp, tape, and edge veneered panels; how to veneer curved panels; and how to inlay, finish, and repair veneers. To anyone who wants to fix up old veneered furniture, the chapter on repairing veneers is itself worth the price of the book; it shows you how to repair chips, blisters, and stains, even replace pieces that have fallen off, with simple tools.The author also covers cores and core stocks, and 136 commonly available veneers in terms of each one's source, color, availability, and price range. Sixty-five photographs and drawings amplify the text, and sixteen different veneered woods are shown in full color on the covers.Veneering is an ancient and honorable craft, and when you select the wood yourself and do your own construction, you can be sure that the veneers you make will retain their beauty for years, even for generations. This excellent, comprehensive book will give you all the expert instruction you need.",

        "Description": "Young, ambitious, and a little green, Jim Stringer moves from the country to the garish, seedy, and dangerous side of 1903 London, determined to become a railway man. A chance meeting has gotten him his foot in the door of the South East Railway, run out of Waterloo Station. Jim finds his duties are confined to a mysterious graveyard line, the so-called Necropolis Railway, which takes dead bodies from central London to the gigantic new cemeteries being built--dug--in the city's outskirts. For some reason, the men he works alongside have formed an instant loathing for him. And his predecessor has disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Forced to live by his wits and to arrive at his own deductions, Jim tries to work out what is going on before he too gets a one-way ticket on board the Necropolis Railway. This novel launches a series featuring Jim Stringer, who, with the help of his landlady--soon his wife and easily his match in wit--tackles some of the darker mysteries that have ridden the rails of England in the Edwardian Age, the period of Kipling, Peter Pan, and H.G. Wells. It will be followed by BLACKPOOL FLYER and THE LOST LUGGAGE PORTER.",

Morgan Chase, a thirty-four-year-old contracts lawyer, is pushed to her romantic wit's end when she discovers that her boyfriend of nine months, investment banker Marcus Alexander, has been diversifying his \"portfolio\" with another woman. After a few hours of venting with her girlfriends, and more than a few drinks, Morgan decides that the only way you can guarantee that a man will act right after you've been intimate is if you make him sign a contract before you've been intimate.    That very same night, Morgan heads back to the office to create the first-ever relationship contract -- a legal document full of conditions, consideration, and most important, consequences.    Sparks fly, tempers flare, and emotions hit the fan when the man Morgan finally convinces to sign her contract is caught red-handed with another woman. What follows is an ingeniously plotted and thoroughly entertaining fusion of comedy, romance, and courtroom mayhem.    What happens when love itself is put on trial?

Like Thomas Pynchon, Robert Coover, Mark Richard, Lewis Nordan, Wuori doesn't care to mollycoddle the reader. He's here, in this daring debut collection, to reflect what's on his mind: America's fascination with violence, with sex, with racism, with joyful immortality. Set in the northernmost corner of Maine, in a town \"usually omitted from cheap maps,\" Nude in Tub is about a young couple who make love on La-Z-Boys in the middle of a highway, about an old woman who finds a pine tree growing from her leg, about newlyweds who paint their whole house black and themselves white, and about several more stripped-down others, including, of course, a nude in tub. Descendants of Sherwood Anderson's Winesburgers, Wuori's Quillifarkeagans are Americans at the millenium, good citizens whose reality has been tweaked, twitted, quirked, smirked and found to be grimly goofy. These people - each of them caught in their own startling moment of nakedness - all live by the same credo: If you're in trouble, we'll help. But we'll still laugh like hell.",

        "Description": "After a year as exchange professor at a Tokyo university, William Bevis spent part of the next year traveling in Sarawak, a Malaysian state located on the northern part of the island of Borneo. About the size of New York, it has a population of 1.7 million people living, outside of a few towns, in a world of jungle and brown rivers. There the rainforest is being cut rapidly, local corruption and greed siphon off most of the profit, native rights and land uses are being obliterated, and much of the fine timber is shipped to Japan to become plywood forms for concrete that are thrown away after two uses.This book is a travel narrative and also a serious environmental study of exploitation of third-world resources. During his stay in Sarawak, the author lived with both native activists and timber camp managers, seeking to understand the motives and actions of Japanese companies, Chinese entrepreneurs, and the native population most affected by the timber trade.Interspersed with chapters narrating the author\u2019s journey are chapters dealing with the history, economy, and political life of the region. Fascinating profiles of major figures who have influenced the course of events include James Wong, Minister of Environment for Sarawak and owner of one of the largest timber concessions, and Bruno Manser, a Swiss adventurer who was adopted by the nomadic Penan tribe and hunted by the police for organizing opposition to the timber trade.Borneo Log is not simply a book about environmental politics in a far-away place. The power of the book lies in the author\u2019s extraordinary ability to bring home the related global disasters of the destruction of the world\u2019s rainforests and its indigenous peoples. This is a personal and passionate account of how ordinary men and women are fighting to defend a way of life that is rapidly disappearing along with their country\u2019s resources, and how the problems of their lives echo in our own.",

Chef Ellie \"Lemon\" Manelli's hip East Village bistro is suddenly all the rage; Lemon and her staff of wildly talented friends plucked from New York City's finest eateries can barely keep pace. Good thing she has her loyal, doting, bankrolling Georgia peach of a boyfriend, Eddie, to lean on -- not to mention a gaggle of loving relations over the river in Brooklyn. In fact, Lemon's life is turning out exactly as she planned -- except for the fact that she's late. As in late. Nobody said anything about, you know, labor.  Having a baby right now would jeopardize everything Lemon has worked so hard to accomplish, so the pregnancy test results leave her feeling a little sour. Eddie, bless his heart, wants to just go ahead and get married, but Lemon's not sure the timing's right. She's about to learn a lesson or two about love and loss, though. And in the end she'll discover that there's a reason things work out the way they do -- and that when life gives you lemons, you can make lemonade, or lemon tarts, or lemon meringue pie. Or, you can just be a plain ole Lemon, if that's what you were meant to be.",

He seeks to debunk European \"prejudices about and stereotypes of the American economy\" and presents statistics to back up his case.

The strange color of the ocean water reminds Stephen of Homer's famous description, but it also portends a spectacular submarine volcanic eruption that will create a new island overnight and leave an indelible impression on the reader's imagination.Their ship, the Surprise, is now also a privateer, the better to escape diplomatic complications from Stephen's mission, which is to ignite the revolutionary tinder of South America. Jack will survive a desperate open-boat journey and come face to face with his illegitimate black son; Stephen, caught up in the aftermath of his failed coup, will flee for his life into the high, frozen wastes of the Andes; and Patrick O'Brian's brilliantly detailed narrative will reunite them at last in a breathtaking chase through storm seas and icebergs south of Cape Horn, where the hunters suddenly become the hunted.This is storytelling without models or equals in recent literature; critics have noted in O'Brian's great Aubrey/Maturin epic, now sixteen volumes in length, haunting echoes of such writers as Joseph Conrad, Herman Melville, and Jane Austen. Some readers will respond to the undeniable excitement of the chases, storms, and battles, others to the precision of language, or the humor, or the wealth of erudition in Maturin's researches and conversations. But the truest mark of O'Brian's stature as a novelist may be the great number of readers who find fresh delights and deeper resonances in rereading his novels.",

But after his return to Washington, he receives dismaying news. It is inevitable that the great Soviet spy and the renowned American agent will meet again-this time with deadly consequences.",

Stark begins his political career as an idealistic man of the people but soon becomes corrupted by success and caught between dreams of service and an insatiable lust for power.  As relevant today as it was more than fifty years ago, All the King's Men is one of the classics of American literature.",

Paris is divorced, mother to a nearly seventeen-year-old son and the one who always comes to everybody's rescue&#151;although she doesn't have a clue as to how to save herself. Lewis is the scapegoat, and his troubles keep landing him in jail, which only seems to confirm what his family thinks he is. Out in Chicago, Charlotte knows she's gotten the short end of the stick for years, has \"nothing in common except blood\" with her parents and siblings and would just as soon divorce them all. Janelle, the baby of the family, is not only on the defensive about the course of her own life but she's facing a new crisis, a fast-brewing storm with her teenage daughter that threatens more than she's willing to admit. And don't even ask Viola about Cecil: \"He's a bad habit I've had for thirty-eight years which would make him my husband.\" But Cecil has some ideas for taking his hardworking life into his own hands, regardless of what his wife and kids think about it.With her hallmark exuberance and a cast of characters so sassy, resilient, and full of life that they breathe, dream, and shout right off the page, Terry McMillan has given us a tour-de-force novel of family, healing and redemption. A Day Late and a Dollar Short takes us deep into the hearts, minds, and souls of America&#151;and gives us six more friends we never want to leave.",
