Author Robbie Allen, a Senior Systems Architect at Cisco Systems and co-author of our Active Directory tutorial, based this collection of troubleshooting recipes on his own experience, along with input from Windows administrators throughout the industry. Each recipe includes a discussion to explain how and why the solution works, so you can adapt the problem-solving techniques to similar situations.If your company is considering an upgrade from Windows NT or 2000 to Windows Server 2003, the Active Directory Cookbook for Windows Server 2003 & Windows 2000 will help reduce the time and trouble it takes to configure and deploy Active Directory for your network.This Cookbook is also a perfect companion to Active Directory, the tutorial that experts hail as the best source for understanding Microsoft's network directory service.

        "Authors": "By Johnston, David and Master, Kim",
        "Description": "An encyclopedic how-to of all you need to make your home green  Whether because of changing lifestyles or simply because houses are becoming outdated, millions of North Americans are renovating their homes every year, spending more money annually on renovation than on new home construction. But renovations can be fraught with unintended consequences like indoor air pollution. How do you remodel in a healthy, environmentally friendly way?  Green Remodeling is a comprehensive guide. It first points out the advantages of remodeling. Buildings are responsible for 40% of worldwide energy flow and material use; so how you remodel can make a difference. Upgrading furnaces, cabinets and toilets means less fossil fuel pollution, reduced resource depletion, and fewer health risks. Green remodeling is more energy-efficient, more resource-conserving, healthier for occupants and more affordable to create, operate and maintain.  The book then discusses simple green renovation solutions for homeowners, focusing on key aspects of the building including foundations, framing, plumbing, windows, heating and finishes. Room by room, it outlines the intricate connections that make the house work as a system. For example, how new windows may affect the structure and mechanical systems of the rooms below, the health of the family, and the future of old-growth forests. Then, in an easy-to-read format complete with checklists, personal stories, expert insights and an extensive resource list, it covers easy ways to save energy, conserve natural resources, and protect the health of loved ones. Addressing all climates, this is a perfect resource for conventional homeowners, as well as architects and remodeling contractors.",

Based on her extensive clinical experience with adults abused as children, she has developed a unique, much-needed program specifically for couples. It provides guidance in:Anger management.Safe and successful ways to express feelings.The dangerous trigger words: what are they; what they do.Touching or being touched: no more fear; no more guilt.Good sex: Loving, fulfilling intimacy.Decision-making and power: equal partners at last.Ending the silence: communication that worked.Commitment: being able to count on tomorrow... and more.",

This time a controversial miracle in Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge Mountains sparks religious fervor\u2013and a suspicious death. Now the indefatigable felines Mrs. Murphy and Pewter, along with the dogged corgi Tee Tucker, must trust their animal instincts to sniff out the worst of human nature....With the holidays approaching, Mary Minor \u201cHarry\u201d Haristeen and her best friend, Susan Tucker, take a much-needed time-out at the mountain monastery of Mount Carmel. There, under the benevolent gaze of the statue of the Virgin Mary, their worldly worries are soon overshadowed. For in front of their very eyes the statue begins to cry tears of blood. Legend has it that Mary\u2019s crimson tears are harbingers of crises. And though skeptical, the ever-practical Harry can already see one on the horizon. If leaked, news of the so-called miracle could turn the monastery and the town of Crozet into a circus. What Harry doesn\u2019t foresee is murder.\u2026When Susan\u2019s great-uncle Thomas, a resident monk, is found frozen to death at the base of the statue, foul play is ruled out\u2013at first. But at Harry\u2019s urging, the body is exhumed for an autopsy. There\u2019s just one problem: the coffin is empty. That\u2019s when Mrs. Murphy, Pewter, and Tucker get involved. Then there\u2019s the shocking revelation of a mystery that has perplexed the citizens of Crozet for ages.With Christmas around the corner and the monastery overrun by the faithful, all Harry\u2019s meddling menagerie can do is stay on her trail as she jumps knee-deep into an unofficial investigation\u2013one that becomes more dangerous when another Crozet citizen meets an untimely demise.

        "Title": "The Search for Al Qaeda: Its Leadership, Ideology, and Future",
        "Authors": "By Riedel, Bruce",
        "Description": "Al Qaeda is the most dangerous terrorist movement in history. Yet most people in the Americas and Europe know very little about it, or their view is clouded by misperceptions and half truths. If the first rule of war is to ?know your enemy,' then we have a long way to go. This important book fills this gap with a comprehensive analysis of al Qaeda?the origins, leadership, ideology, and strategy of the terrorist network that brought down the Twin Towers and continues to threaten us today.  Bruce Riedel is an expert on the Middle East and South Asia, with thirty years of intelligence and policymaking experience. He was actually in the White House Situation Room during the 9/11 attacks, serving as special assistant to the president and National Security Council senior director for Near East Affairs. He draws on this insider experience in profiling the four most important figures in the al Qaeda movement: Osama bin Laden, its creator and charismatic leader; ideologue Ayman Zawahiri, its Egyptian coleader and principal spokesman; Abu Musaib al Zarqawi, leader of al Qaeda in Iraq until his death in 2006; and Mullah Omar, its Taliban host. These profiles provide the base from which Riedel delivers a much clearer understanding of al Qaeda and what must be done to counter it.  The Search for al Qaeda reviews how al Qaeda was created and developed, presenting authoritative and chilling background on ?The Manhattan Raid,' but Riedel focuses more closely on what has happened to it since that awful day. He outlines al Qaeda's ultimate goals, which are to drive America out of the Muslim world, to destroy Israel, and to create a jihadist caliphate larger than the Ottoman Empire at its height. The profiles and subsequent analysis reveal the network's multipronged strategy for accomplishing those goals:  ? Draw America into ?bleeding wars' like the one that drove the Soviets from Afghanistan.  ? Build a safe haven for al Qaeda in Pakistan.  ? Develop other ?franchises' in the Islamic world that can overthrow pro-American regimes.  ? Conduct more Western attacks along the lines of 9/11 or the transit bombings in Madrid and London.  The book concludes with a strategy for dealing with?and defeating?this most dangerous menace.",
