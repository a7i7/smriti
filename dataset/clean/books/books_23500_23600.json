        "Description": "Northeast Asia's stunningly successful political economy threatens to become a military danger zone - with global implications. In Pacific Defense, Kent E. Calder, director of the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, shows how a combination of high-speed economic growth, impending energy shortages, and political insecurity could well provoke an accelerating arms buildup and deepening geopolitical rivalries. Here he explains the urgent need for a strategic, far-sighted American role in defusing these dangerous possibilities.Calder analyzes the risks to regional stability of Asia's continuing struggle for offshore oil, and the subtle dangers that regional energy dependence on the Middle East may bring. He also points to the possible links between efforts to acquire civilian nuclear power and the potential for nuclear armament.Political uncertainty casts deep shadows over Asia's key nations, as experienced leaders pass from the scene and popular frustrations mount, from the large cities of China to the crucial U.S.-Japan island military bastion of Okinawa. Calder provides a dynamic overview of where each country is headed politically and describes the role that the United States can play in these developments, from improving security relations with Japan to studying alternate sources of energy for China to resolving nuclear arms issues in North Korea.",

        "Description": "Now Rita Mae Brown, author of the bestselling classic Rubyfruit Jungle, returns with her most wonderfully irreverent and thoroughly entertaining novel yet. What happens when a wildly successful Southern belle inadvertently tells the truth about her life to her family, her friends, her lover, and herself?At thirty-five, Mary Frazier Armstrong, called \"Frazier\" by friends and enemies alike, is a sophisticated green-eyed blonde with a thriving art gallery, a healthy bank balance, and an enviable social position. In fact, she has everything to live for, but she's lying in a hospital bed with a morphine drip in her arm and a life expectancy measured in hours. \"Don't die a stranger\" Mandy Eisenhart, her assistant at the gallery, says on her last hospital visit. \"Tell the people you love who you are, or write them.\" And so, as her last act here on earth, Frazier writes letters to her closest family and friends, telling them exactly what she thinks of them and, since she will be dead by the time they receive the letters, the truth about herself: She's gay.The letters are sent. Then the manure hits the fan in Charlottesville, Virginia ... because Frazier Armstrong wakes up the next morning to hear her doctor explaining that it's all been a mistake. Frazier can look forward to a long, happy life. But if this formerly dutiful daughter isn't dying, she certainly seems to be facing a descent into hell: Her mother, Libby, committee woman extraordinaire,is throwing a hissy fit; her best friend, the gay hunk Billy Cicero, is cutting her dead; her former lover, Ann, is having hysterics now that \"everyone is going to know\"; and her gorgeous, charming brother Carter whose two favorite activities are getting drunk and getting laid, is gleefully spreading the word that his can-do-no-wrong sister is a dyke.Yet Frazier soon realizes she's spent her whole life steeling herself against people, and hiding - and not just because she is gay. After three decades of having \"a near-life experience,\" she is determined to make a new beginning - as a brash, brazen, and totally irresistible woman who will raise the act of coming out of the closet into an art form.Rita Mae Brown once told an interviewer \"Next time anyone calls me a lesbian writer I'm going to knock their teeth in. I'm a writer and I'm a woman and I'm from the South and I'm alive, and that is that.\" Frazier Armstrong couldn't have put it better.",

        "Description": "No one portrays crime and cops with the outrageous humor and vibrant color of Joseph Wambaugh. Now, in a timely new novel, the bestselling author sends an unforgettable trio on a mission to make sense of a seemingly irrational conspiracy involving deadly toxic waste and a theft of U.S. Navy goods.A master of the skewering one-liner, and at that awkward age between mid-life crisis and catastrophe, San Diego police detective Finbar Brendan Finnegan is also an aspiring actor whose agent can't even get him an audition for a cheesy TV series. And the thrice-divorced, cynical police veteran thinks he's seen it all until he faces a killer more deadly than any psychopath: a fifty-five-gallon drum of deadly chemicals.That's what two disgruntled truckers are hauling for a toxic waste disposal company owned by yacht club playboy Jules Temple, an amoral practitioner of extortion, forgery, and much more. With their boss's entrepreneurial spirit, the two haulers decide to steal two thousand pairs of shoes from the U.S. Navy to sell on the Mexican black market, but once they cross south of the border their impulsive scheme goes haywire and results in horror and death.Sorting out various suspects, as well as EPA documents required for toxic chemical shipments, Fin joins forces with a pair of extraordinary female investigators. Nell Salter, an environmental crimes cop from the District Attorney's Office, is a fortyish beauty whose nose was broken by the only man she ever married, a mistake she'll not make again, or so she vows to even more unlucky-in-love Fin Finnegan, who hasn't married anybody since he's \"matured.\" Then there's U.S. Navy investigator Bobbie Ann Doggett of Kenosha, Wisconsin, nicknamed \"Bad Dog\" by her navy colleagues. This Bad Dog is a vivacious twenty-eight-year-old who falls in puppy love with Detective Fin Finnegan, that older gentleman of the Clinton-Gore generation. Finnegan is equally smitten by the young sailor, Much to the disgust of Nell Salter, who calls him a \"Peter Pan policeman.\"Sparks, fur and insults fly when this unique trio of investigators sets out to make sense of twisted schemes and murderous intentions involving environmental crime and U.S. Navy property, while disturbing personal feelings keep getting in the way. From millionaires' yachts in San Diego harbor to biker bars teeming with violence; from the machinations of evil and greed in the toxic waste business to the exotic killing streets of Tijuana, Finnegans' Week uncoils in an electrifying and unexpected finale. This is Joseph Wambaugh at his rousing best!",

You're Not What I Expected shows couples that dialogue is at the heart of friendship and trust.",

I think these sorts of slang terms create further isolation in a teen, and that's not what you want to do to a teen who already feels alone\" \u2014Alexander, 18, from a small town in the South\"A guy is supposed to be strong, tall, and fast and have the qualities of an ideal athlete. At the same time he's supposed to be smart. He's expected to be nearly perfect.\" \u2014Chandler, 14, from a suburb in the Northwest\"What I hate about this school is that I am being picked on in the halls and just about everywhere else.\" \u2014Cody, 14, from a suburb in New EnglandIn Real Boys, Dr. William Pollack explored the issues that most boys in our nation face today. In this fascinating follow-up bestseller, Pollack goes right to the source: boys ages 10 to 20-evoking the secret struggles and passions of America's adolescent males in their own words. Their voices are searingly honest and eager to be heard, revealing how society's outdated expectations force them to mask their feelings of isolation, depression, longing, love, and hope. We hear from boys and young men in big cities and small towns-including survivors of the Columbine High School massacre-who share compelling, extrordinarily candid stories about bullying, drugs, sports, school, parents, sex, love, and much more. Pollack also offers ways to start a dialog and illustrates through templates what to do in many situations. This is an eye-opening book for teenage boys and girls, but-with its insights and strategies for dealing with their issues-especially invaluable for all the people in their lives.",

Humming can make you a better tennis player? Or completely giving up is the way to succeed?In The Breakout Principle, the bestselling author of The Relaxation Response delivers the ultimate self-help principle -- simple instructions to activate a powerful biological trigger that converts conflict and confusion into clarity and extraordinary performance, a state athletes refer to as \"the zone.\"More than three decades ago, Dr. Herbert Benson of the Harvard Medical School began research into why some people are devastated by stress while others thrive, turning it into brilliant achievement. Now The Breakout Principle reports the discovery of an easy-to-access inner switch that increases mental function, enhances creativity and productivity, maximizes athletic performance, and enriches spiritual life. The same internal mechanism that improves a tennis serve or golf putt strengthens your speaking skills, makes you a better negotiator, and fosters inner peace and belief.Dr. Benson and coauthor William Proctor explain the cutting-edge science behind the phenomenon in accessible language, clearly describe the four distinct phases of the Breakout, and provide simple, step-by-step instructions on how to activate the Breakout \"trigger.\" Compelling case histories and information on how to incorporate Breakouts into daily life are woven throughout the book.Dr. Benson's previous discoveries have helped millions reduce the harmful effects of stress.

Now grown, yet shaped by their years in the schoolhouse, they lead different lives. The Copper Beech is about eight of these dreamers.From Ryan's Hotel to Barna Woods, where the gypsies came each year, from Nellie Dunne's sweet shop to Father Gunn's church, the tenor of life in this small Irish village is outwardly placid and uneventful. Some, like Nessa Ryan, in search of passion, would say deadly dull. But behind the calm exterior, serenity fades into unexpected drama: Maddy Ross has a secret love; Eddie Barton, a surprising friendship; and the Darcys, the glamorous newcomers, find a curious partner in poor Maura Brennan.In Shancarrig, where the river runs around the great rock for which the town is named, human life flows in all its variety. Lives intertwine just as names crisscross on the trunk of the copper beech. At the cottages where the Dunnes live in poverty; the grand house of Leo Murphy; the Kellys', near the school; Dr. Jims's, on The Terrace - nothing is as it seems. With humor, warmth, and a ruthless eye for the ironies of self-delusion, Maeve Binchy uncovers the secrets hidden in each person's heart, showing us that extraordinary stories can be found anywhere, if only one knows where to look.",

The frantic phone call sends him and his wife, Rina, on a plane east to the home of Decker's half brother, a rabbi whose brother-in-law's naked body was found in a sleazy Manhattan hotel room. Even more disturbing: the dead man's fifteen-year-old niece - and possibly the last person to see him alive - has disappeared, leaving her family crazed with worry about her safety.The shocking crime propels Decker onto the streets of a city he hasn't walked in ten years, into an alien environment where his resources quickly run dry and the desperate hours pass without results. With little recourse, Decker is forced into New York's underbelly, seeking help from amoral souls who consider life as expendable as pocket change.Obsessed with his mission to find the girl, Decker follows a labyrinthine trail of cover-ups and lies, of vile deeds and sinister secrets that pit brother against brother. Soon he's questioning the very essence of his faith, battling an unregenerate evil that threatens everything he holds dear - including Rina.",

        "Description": "This splendidly illustrated volume evokes the world of pre-revolutionary Russia on every page and tells the story of the last Romanovs as never before. Peter Kurth, author of Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson, recreates the private life of the imperial family with great clarity and new insights. He begins the story in 1913, a year of celebrations marking 300 years of Romanov rule, but also the last year before the onset of the Great War, which would bring a shattering end to the dynasty. From there he returns to the childhoods of Nicholas and Alexandra and follows them through their courtship, marriage and coronation to the Siberian cellar where their lives ended.The narrative is effectively complemented by archival images from the imperial family's personal albums and private collections, many of them never before published, matched with present-day color photographs of the palaces and places the Romanovs knew. A special visual section, The Imperial Year, documents the family in their palace outside St. Petersburg, at their seaside retreat in the Crimea, on board the royal yacht in the Gulf of Finland and visiting their hunting lodge at Spala, deep in the forests of Poland.Photographer Peter Christopher also followed the path of the imperial family, and his color photographs range from the splendors of Tsarskoe Selo to the remains of \"The House of Special Purpose\" in Ekaterinburg. The many questions still surrounding the murders that took place in that house are examined by Peter Kurth, and in the book's final chapter he details the recent discovery of the Romanov bones and the DNA tests used to determine their authenticity. The fascinating saga of Anna Anderson, the woman who claimed to be Anastasia, the tsar's youngest daughter, is also included along with a candid picture of the Russian aristocracy in exile.",

Set in New York and in Minneapolis-St. Paul, it is the story of Lacey Farrell, a young rising star on Manhattan's high-powered and competitive real estate scene.In the course of selling a luxurious skyline coop, Lacey becomes the witness to a murder and hears the dying words of the victim, a woman who is convinced that her attacker was after a journal kept by her daughter up until the day she died in what everyone but her grieving mother believes to have been a tragic accident. Lacey gives the journal to the police, but not before she makes a copy for herself -- an impetuous act that later proves to be almost fatal.Obliged to give up her family, her job, her very identity, Lacey is placed in the witness protection program and sent to live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where she must assume a new life, at least until the killer can be brought to trial. Once there, she meets and quickly finds herself attracted to Tom Lynch, a young radio talk-show host. He likewise is drawn to her -- but Lacey becomes so upset and confused by the life of lies she is forced to live that she tries to break off their burgeoning relationship. How can she commit to him when she can't even tell him her true name?Then one day she discovers that the killer has traced her to Minneapolis and will soon place not only her but everyone around her in dire jeopardy. Realizing that she is no longer safe, she decides to go back to New York, determined to confront the threat to her life head on.Armed with nothing more than her own courage and the ambiguous and mystifying clues found in the journal, Lacey is caught in a fast-paced race against time as she tries to uncover who was behind the deaths of the two women before she, too, is killed -- not realizing that the journal itself is the reason for the murders....Chilling, spine-tingling suspense is the hallmark of Mary Higgins Clark's novels. In Pretend You Don't See Her, she surpasses herself.",

And he is on an urgent, secret search through the five boroughs of New York.

An inspired innocent, Oskar is alternately endearing, exasperating, and hilarious as he careens from Central Park to Coney Island to Harlem on his search.

As Oskar roams New York, he encounters a motley assortment of humanity who are all survivors in their own way. He befriends a 103-year-old war reporter, a tour guide who never leaves the Empire State Building, and lovers enraptured or scorned.

Now, in The Godfather Returns, acclaimed novelist Mark Winegardner continues the story\u2013the years not covered in Puzo\u2019s bestselling book or in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s classic films. It is 1955. Michael Corleone has won a bloody victory in the war among New York\u2019s crime families. Now he wants to consolidate his power, save his marriage, and take his family into legitimate businesses. To do so, he must confront his most dangerous adversary yet, Nick Geraci, a former boxer who worked his way through law school as a Corleone street enforcer, and who is every bit as deadly and cunning as Michael. Their personal cold war will run from 1955 to 1962, exerting immense influence on the lives of America\u2019s most powerful criminals and their loved ones, including Tom Hagen, the Corleone Family\u2019s lawyer and consigliere, who embarks on a political career in Nevada while trying to protect his brother;Francesca Corleone, daughter of Michael\u2019s late brother Sonny, who is suddenly learning her family\u2019s true history and faces a difficult choice;Don Louie Russo, head of the Chicago mob, who plays dumb but has wily ambitions for muscling in on the Corleones\u2019 territory;Peter Clemenza, the stalwart Corleone underboss, who knows more Family secrets than almost anyone;Ambassador M. Corbett Shea, a former Prohibition-era bootlegger and business ally of the Corleones\u2019, who wants to get his son elected to the presidency\u2013and needs some help from his old friends;Johnny Fontane, the world\u2019s greatest saloon singer, who ascends to new heights as a recording artist, cozying up to Washington\u2019s power elite and maintaining a precarious relationship with notorious underworld figures;Kay Adams Corleone, who finally discovers the truth about her husband, Michael\u2013and must decide what it means for their marriage and their children andFredo Corleone, whose death has never been fully explained until now, and whose betrayal of the Family was part of a larger and more sinister chain of events.Sweeping from New York and Washington to Las Vegas and Cuba, The Godfather Returns is the spellbinding story of America\u2019s criminal underworld at mid-century and its intersection with the political, legal, and entertainment empires. Mark Winegardner brings an original voice and vision to Mario Puzo\u2019s mythic characters while creating several equally unforgettable characters of his own. The Godfather Returns stands on its own as a triumph\u2013in a tale about what we love, yearn for, and sometimes have reason to fear . . . family.",

With aged paper and a leathery stamped case, this delightfully shocking collection harkens back to a time when travelers risked roasting or worse and bad manners could yield frightful consequences.

        "Description": "From one of our most perceptive commentators and winner of the National Book Award, a comprehensive look at the new world of globalization, the international system that, more than anything else, is shaping world affairs today.As the Foreign Affairs columnist for The New York Times, Thomas L. Friedman has traveled the globe, interviewing people from all walks of contemporary life: Brazilian peasants in the Amazon rain forest, new entrepreneurs in Indonesia, Islamic students in Teheran, and the financial wizards on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley.Now Friedman has drawn on his years on the road to produce an engrossing and original look at globalization. Globalization, he argues, is not just a phenomenon and not just a passing trend. It is the international system that replaced the Cold War system; the new, well-greased, interconnected system: Globalization is the integration of capital, technology, and information across national borders, in a way that is creating a single global market and, to some degreee, a global village. Simply put, one can't possibly understand the morning news or one's own investments without some grasp of the system. Just one example: During the Cold War, we reached for the hot line between the White House and the Kremlin--a symbol that we were all divided but at least the two superpowers were in charge. In the era of globalization, we reach for the Internet--a symbol that we are all connected but nobody is totally in charge.With vivid stories and a set of original terms and concepts, Friedman offers readers remarkable access to his unique understanding of this new world order, and shows us how to see this new system. He dramatizes the conflict of \"the Lexus and the olive tree\"--the tension between the globalization system and ancient forces of culture, geography, tradition, and community. He also details the powerful backlash that globalization produces among those who feel brutalized by it, and he spells out what we all need to do to keep the system in balance. Finding the proper balance between the Lexus and the olive tree is the great drama of he globalization era, and the ultimate theme of Friedman's challenging, provocative book--essential reading for all who care about how the world really works.",

An antic blend of homespun and intellectual humor,Bachelor Brothers' Bed & Breakfast is a place readers will want to return to again and again.Bachelor Brothers' Bed & Breakfast, originally published by Douglas & McIntyre, won Canada's prestigious Stephen Lecock Award for Humour in 1994, and was published in hardcover by A Wyatt Book for St. Martin's Press in 1996.

It shares with readers a timeless string of wisdom, warmth and wit from celebrities, political and business leaders, authors, children and others eager to reminisce about the profound effect their grandmothers had on their lives.   With an introduction by Demi Moore, Pearls of Wisdom from Grandma\u00a0 is full of interesting personal stories and quotes from a multicultural swath of American society, from people like George and Barbara Bush, Alice Hoffman, Margaret Atwood, Edwidge Dandicott and Toni Braxton. The grandmother of noted fashion designer Vera Wang once told her: \"Always eat before going out, because it's very unfeminine to eat like a horse.\" Writer Dawna Markova tells us how her grandmother taught her to look at a boy who was missing his legs and see the love and riches he possessed, more so than the elegant man in a fur coat standing next to him. \"Feel what it is like to be him,\" her grandmother said. \"Feel his heart. Now look at him again. Look at that heart. It's pure gold and wide as the sky. He's a rich old soul whose path is to teach all of us about joy.\"   Together, these voices of love paint a heartfelt portrait of everything a grandmother can be: a healer, a guide and inspiration.",

        "Title": "Kitchen Privileges: A Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Clark, Mary Higgins",
        "Description": "In her long-awaited memoir, Mary Higgins Clark, America's beloved and bestselling Queen of Suspense, recounts the early experiences that shaped her as a person and influenced her as a writer.  Even as a young girl, growing up in the Bronx, Mary Higgins Clark knew she wanted to be a writer. The gift of storytelling was a part of her Irish ancestry, so it followed naturally that she would later use her sharp eye, keen intelligence, and inquisitive nature to create stories about the people and things she observed.  Along with all Americans, those who lived in New York City's borough of the Bronx suffered during the Depression. So it followed that when Mary's father died, her mother, deciding to open the family home to boarders, placed a discreet sign next to the front door that read, FURNISHED ROOMS. KITCHEN PRIVILEGES. Very shortly the first in a succession of tenants arrived: a couple dodging bankruptcy who moved in with their wild-eyed boxer; a teacher who wept endlessly over her lost love; a deadbeat who tripped over a lamp while trying to sneak out in the middle of the night...  The family's struggle to make ends meet; her days as a scholarship student in an exclusive girls' academy; her after-school employment as a hotel switchboard operator (happily listening in on the guests' conversations); the death of her beloved older brother in World War II; her brief career as a flight attendant for Pan Am (a job taken after a friend who flew with the airline said ever so casually, \"God, it was beastly hot in Calcutta\"); her marriage to Warren Clark, on whom she'd had a crush for many years; sitting at the kitchen table, writing stories, and finally selling the first one for one hundred dollars (after six years and some forty rejections!) -- all these experiences figure into Kitchen Privileges, as does her husband's untimely death, which left her a widowed mother of five young children.  Determined to care for her family and to make a career for herself, she went to work writing scripts for a radio show, but in her spare time she began writing novels. Her first, a biographical novel about the life of George Washington titled Aspire to the Heavens, found a publisher but disappeared without a trace when the publisher folded. (Recently it was rediscovered by a descendant of the Washington family and was reissued under the title Mount Vernon Love Story.) The experience, however, gave her the background and the preparation for writing Where Are the Children? which went on to become an international bestseller. That novel launched her career and was the first of twenty-seven (and still counting!) bestselling books of suspense.  As Mary Higgins Clark has said when asked if she might consider giving up writing for a life of leisure, \"Never! To be happy for a year, win the lottery. To be happy for life, love what you do.\" In Kitchen Privileges, she reflects on the joy that her life as a writer has brought her, and shares with readers the love that she has found.",

And big trouble it is, not just for his friend but for Billy Bob himself -- in the form of Wyatt Dixon, a recent prison parolee sworn to kill Billy Bob as revenge for both his imprisonment and his sister's death, both of which he blames on the former Texas lawman. As the mysteries multiply and the body count mounts, the reader is drawn deeper into the tortured mind of Billy Bob Holland, a complex hero tormented by the mistakes of his past and driven to make things -- all things -- right. But beneath the guise of justice for the weak and downtrodden lies a tendency for violence that at times becomes more terrifying than the danger he is trying to eradicate.  As USA Today noted in discussing the parallels between Billy Bob Holland and Burke's other popular series hero, David Robicheaux, \"Robicheaux and Holland are two of a kind, white-hat heroes whose essential goodness doesn't keep them from fighting back. The two series describe different landscapes, but one theme remains constant: the inner conflict when upright men are provoked into violence in defense of hearth, home, women, and children. There are plenty of parallels. Billy Bob is an ex-Texas Ranger; Dave is an ex-New Orleans cop. Dave battles alcoholism and the ghosts of Vietnam; Billy Bob actually sees ghosts, including the Ranger he accidentally gunned down....But most of all, both protagonists hold a vision of a pure and simple life.\"  In Bitterroot, with its rugged and vivid setting, its intricate plot, and a set of remarkable, unforgettable characters, and crafted with the lyrical prose and the elegiac tone that have inspired many critics to compare him to William Faulkner, James Lee Burke has written a thriller destined to surpass the success of his previous novels.",
