        "Authors": "By Jonas, Susan and Nissenson, Marilyn",
        "Description": "Mention the word pig and people smile. They picture pink skin, a corkscrew tall, and the adorable snout of a piglet. They think of Miss Piggy, Wilbur, and Porky Pig. Pigs have inspired writers from Ovid to Mother Goose and artists from ancient Herculaneum to contemporary Hollywood. Still, people can't decide what to make of pigs. Pigs are so compelling, so mysterious, so contradictory - finicky yet fat, massive yet dainty, stolid yet smart. Humans, uneasy about their role in the life and death of pigs, make images of them that reveal complex feelings of attraction, revulsion, sentimentality, and guilt.In The Ubiquitous Pig, authors Marilyn Nissenson and Susan Jonas take an affectionate look at the many-sided relationship between humans and pigs and the art people have made to reflect that bond. Presented in 165 illustrations, 90 of them in color, are some of the most beguiling, dignified, haunting, cuddly, and ferocious images of pigs from antiquity to the present, along with excerpts from writings about them. Sprinkled throughout are sidebars, aphorisms, and little-known facts about these fascinating but often misunderstood creatures.The relationship between people and pigs has been noted by medical researchers, political cartoonists, and literary figures, including G. K. Chesterton, Thomas Hardy, George Orwell, Charles Lamb, Beatrix Potter, Lewis Carroll, Dylan Thomas, E. B. White, and Harry Truman, who said, \"No man should be allowed to be president who does not understand hogs.\" Representations of pigs are among the earliest works of art, and they have remained a compelling subject for artists as diverse as Hieronymous Bosch, Faberge, Eadweard Muybridge, Winslow Homer, Currier and Ives, Alexander Calder, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Charles Addams, Maurice Sendak, and William Steig.The authors provide a lively introduction, filled with anecdotes and history. A brief bibliography for the hard-core pig fan and an index round out this charming volume.",

        "Authors": "By Sutton, Nina and Sharp, David (TRN)",
        "Description": "Who was Bruno Bettelheim? The brilliant discoverer of a unique method of treating psychotic children, justly acclaimed the world over? Or the brutal and despotic bully who was denounced after his death by former students and patients?In her quest to understand this puzzling and powerful man, Nina Sutton spent five years tracing Bettelheim's footsteps from Vienna to Los Angeles, via Chicago, Basel, and Jerusalem. She interviewed students and colleagues, friends and enemies, and uncovered rare documents, including Bettelheim's letters from Buchenwald and Dachau.As the internationally famous director of the Orthogenic School in Chicago and the author of a dozen bestsellers on Nazism, child rearing, emotional disturbances, and fairy tales, Bettelheim was always surrounded by controversy. He was a Jew who rejected the inevitability of the Holocaust, a psychoanalyst who challenged the very notion of \"insanity,\" and a man who liked to shroud his life in mystery and sometimes outright lies.Most significantly, he was a therapist driven by an almost magical idea: that from an absolute evil, Nazism, could be drawn the salvation of deeply disturbed children. Sutton shows how Bettelheim discovered his life force in the concentration camp and then tried to use his own aggression as a lighting rod for the self-destructive anger and violence seething within the children in his care. Probing deep into his past and into the scandal that broke out after his suicide, she reveals how care and brutality, commitment to truth and a passion for fairy tales, could coexist in this exceptional man.",

During this time, many companies have learned that personalizing the customer experience is good for business. In Mass Career Customization, the authors argue convincingly to extend this popular and profitable concept to the workplace.This book is centered on the powerful insight that career options in today\u2019s economy need to accommodate the rising and falling phases of employee engagement as it changes over time. The remarkable process unveiled in this book offers choices involving four important dimensions of career progression: role; pace; location and schedule; and workload.As the working population shrinks, maintaining industry advantage will depend largely on keeping employees engaged and connected. Mass career customization provides a framework for organizational adaptability that will do just that.",

        "Authors": "By Bonner, Nigel",
        "Description": "This latest title in the \"Of the World\" series - the seventeenth - covers that fascinating group of animals whose evolution into their present forms and life-styles seems almost contradictory. While seals, sea lions and walruses are indeed mammals, their habitat is very much an aquatic one, their limbs now fully adapted for swimming rather than land locomotion.The various families of the order Pinnipedia - fur seals, sea lions, walruses and the phocid seals - are described and illustrated. Evolution, classification, distribution, life-cycles, zoology and their current status and future are all fully discussed. In addition, the complex question of their relationship with humans is examined. As with other marine-dwelling mammals, the issues are controversial. In examining topics such as conflicts between seals and fishing and culling and the fur trade, expert author Nigel Bonner adopts a professional and unemotional approach, based on first-hand knowledge and much experience.Their aquatic life and the remoteness of their habitats make the seals and their kin hard to study. Yet encounters with these species have produced in many people a particularly strong response, sometimes becoming sentimental. This book sensibly places them in context through a clear understanding of their natural history and their interactions with humans. The text is enhanced throughout by some 100 color photographs, detailed diagrams and maps.",

        "Title": "The Threat Closer to Home: Hugo Chavez and the War Against America",
        "Authors": "By Schoen, Douglas and Rowan, Michael",
        "Description": "A chilling account of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's shadow war on the United States    The American government has shrugged off South American politics for nearly forty years. In the meantime, our neighbor to the south has grown into an unprecedented threat. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the current president of Venezuela and a self-proclaimed enemy of the United States, commands what even Osama bin Laden only dreams of -- but few Americans see him as a true danger to this country. This book argues that we should.   Ch\u00e1vez has the means and the motivation to harm the United States in a way that few other countries can, and he has declared an \"asymmetric war\" against America. He runs a sovereign nation that is the fourth largest supplier of oil to the United States. He enjoys annual windfall oil profits that equal the net worth of Bill Gates. He has more modern weapons than anyone in Latin America. He has strategic alliances with Iran, North Korea, and other enemies of America, yet he has duped many Americans -- from influential political and cultural leaders to ordinary citizens who benefit from his oil largess through his state-owned oil company -- into believing that he is a friend.   Drawing on two decades of experience working at the highest level of Venezuelan and American politics, Schoen and Rowan go behind the scenes to examine Ch\u00e1vez's efforts to subvert both the American economy and his own country's stability. Not only did he help drive the price of oil from ten dollars a barrel to more than a hundred dollars a barrel, he's sponsored and become increasingly involved in civilian massacres, drug running, money laundering, nuclear weapons proliferation, and terrorist training.   Schoen and Rowan have both the insight and the access to make a case not yet made in the American media. Over the course of the past decade while living and working in Venezuela as writers and political consultants, they've investigated Ch\u2021vez's past, explored his family connections, and gone up against him in a series of elections. Their startling revelations about Ch\u2021vez's rise to power and his reach into American politics make this the kind of urgent, newsbreaking narrative that will spark vital debate in the corridors of power.",

        "Description": "AIDS is the most devastating communicable disease in history, and structures of poverty and injustice are magnifying the crisis in underresourced countries.More than 36 million people are infected with HIV/AIDS\u2014the vast majority of them in the poor world, or in poor and marginalized communities within wealthy countries. And since AIDS was first recognized in the early 1980s, 13 million children have been orphaned and 22 million people have died from the disease.Irwin and Millen, co-authors of the critically praised Dying for Growth: Global Inequality and the Health of the Poor, demonstrate that it is morally imperative and practically feasible to control the spread of AIDS by overturning common myths about treatment and prevention.For example, it is often argued that ordinary citizens in rich countries can do little to fight AIDS in poor counties. But Irwin and Millen show how individual activists, students, health providers, and members of international health organizations have helped to play pivotal roles in lowering drug prices and securing increased funding for vaccine development. Activism and education by groups like ACT UP, Student Global AIDS Campaign, and various religious organizations is forcing national and international leaders to take greater responsibility for the global AIDS crisis.Features a comprehensive resource guide. Illustrated with photographs. Alexander Irwin is an assistant professor of religious studies at Amherst College. Joyce Millen is Director of Research for the Institute for Health and Social Justice. Irwin and Millen are co-authors of Dying for Growth: Global Inequality and the Health of the Poor. James Orbinski, president of Doctors Without Borders, called Dying for Growth \"deeply intelligent, thoroughly researched\u2014a must-read for all citizens and activists committed to meaningful change.\"",

Together with Utah Congressman Wayne Owens, Abraham made more than sixty trips to the Middle East between 1988 to 2002, meeting with Arab leaders Hosni Mubarak, Hafez Assad, Crown Prince Abdullah, and Yasser Arafat, and Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Shamir, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, Ehud Barak, and Ariel Sharon.Using his business experience with difficult negotiations, Abraham took an active behind-the-scenes role, setting up critical one-on-one meetings between key figures. He urged these leaders to articulate not what they wanted, but what they needed, to make peace, fostering significant advances in the peace process. Since Owens' untimely death in 2002, Abraham has continued to arrange peacemaking meetings on his own.Drawing from meeting transcripts, diary entries, and extensive handwritten notes, Abraham writes in the first person about these extraordinary, often private meetings, giving us rare \"you are there\" insight into historically significant events. In his pragmatic and hopeful book, he writes, \"I am a great optimist, particularly about a region of the world that usually brings out people's most pessimistic inclinationsIsrael and its neighbors.\" Foreword by President Bill Clinton. 16 page color photo insert, maps, chronology, index.",

When Devyani was eleven, her parents divorced, and the courts required her to choose which parent to live with. She chose to live with her father in Toronto and then spent the next eight years navigating between two religions (Hinduism and Judaism), two cultures (Indian and Canadian), two traditions and two people\u2014belonging to both and to neither at once.In late 1999, at the age of nineteen, Devyani was invited by her mother to join her in the holy city of Benares, India, to work on Water, the final installment in Mehta's acclaimed Elements trilogy (which started with Fire and Earth). After only a week of shooting, Water became the target of a series of politically motivated attacks. The movie was shut down. Devyani went off to Oxford and, then, three years later rejoined her mother when production resumed in Sri Lanka. What began as a journey to heal deep wounds from the past turned into a five-year odyssey to complete the film.Transformative and inspiring, Shooting Water chronicles Saltzman's life-changing experience in India, the struggle to produce a film, and, through that struggle, the emergence of a deeper love between mother and daughter. 16 b/w photographs.",

A routine arson investigation promises to get him back on his (clawed) feet, until the case sends him to New York, the scene of his partner\u2019s suspicious death by runaway taxi. Witty, fast-paced detective work makes for a good mystery, but the story\u2019s sly, seamlessly conceived dinosaur underworld contains all the elements of a cult classic. Grade: A.\u201d \u2013Entertainment Weekly \u201cDebut novelist Eric Garcia pulls off this parallel dino world to a T (rex). [His] descriptions are delicious\u2026inventive and imaginative. He cleverly avoids what could have been a one-joke book with charm, sly humor and a terrific narrative pace.\u201d \u2013USA Today\u201cWhat would the world be like if the dinosaurs hadn\u2019t gone extinct? As this very funny book shows, for one thing, L.A. would be even weirder than it is now.\u201d \u2013Dave Barry\u201cFirst-time novelist Eric Garcia pulls it off, keeping the laughs frequent and the plot intriguing. After a few chapters, it seems downright logical to believe we\u2019re surrounded by a cast out of Jurassic Park. Apart from showing off a splendidly warped imagination, Garcia provides a solid mystery.\u201d \u2013People \u201cGarcia has come up with an imaginative twist to the detective fiction genre.\u201d \u2013Daily Variety \u201cAudacious and imaginative. You might not believe any of this 30 seconds after you close the covers, but while it\u2019s going on you\u2019re going to be dazzled by Garcia\u2019s energy and chutzpah.\u201d \u2013Publishers Weekly\u201cGarcia plays it almost completely straight, respecting all noir traditions, and comes up with lovely touches.\u201d \u2013Chicago Tribune\u201cA \u2018noir-asaurus\u2019 of a novel, bellowing for attention, the first and only of its breed in the dinosaur detective genre. Garcia has written something so strange, so bizarre, that he\u2019s to be admired just for the attempt. And he not only pulls it off, he also actually makes you wonder why someone hasn\u2019t thought of it before. Garcia\u2019s tough guy deadpan is perfect for navigating his outrageous lost world, and the easy, familiar tone is probably what makes the premise so simple to swallow. Garcia talks the talk, and more importantly, he smirks in all the right places.\u201d \u2013The Miami Herald \u201cVincent Rubio, the protagonist of this first-person\u2014er, first-dino narrative is so likeable, the story handled with such deftness, that it actually, incredibly works. Spider Robinson meets Sam Spade. The writing is sardonic and strong in the hard-boiled tradition, and laced with jokes about the history humans think they know: Oliver Cromwell was a Brontosaur, and \u2018Capone and Eliot Ness were just two Diplodoci with a grudge to settle.\u2019\u201d \u2013The Richmond Times Dispatch\u201cAnonymous Rex leaps out of its gumshoe formula fast enough to break the genre barrier.

        "Description": "Based on eyewitness accounts and original interviews, this bold new work provides a vivid portrayal of the evolving political and cultural role played by Islamic fundamentalist movements. Drawing on his firsthand experiences, Mark Huband moves deep inside the contemporary Islamic movements of countries as diverse as Morocco and Afghanistan.Huband reveals how Western powers have contributed to the rise of Islamic movements by their earlier support of the Afghan Islamic resistance and gives detailed accounts of his discussions with militant groups, Muslim scholars, and political opponents of the Islamic movements.Enriching these discussions, the author contextualizes the movements by exploring their historical and intellectual framework. The book uniquely illustrates the variety found within the movements, as well as the range of relationships the Islamic movements have to the various countries in which they are active.Warriors of the Prophet details the current crisis in Algeria; the disappointments of Arab nationalism and socialist experiments in Egypt; the social breakdown of Somalia in relation to the ideal of an Islamic way of life; the disaffected youth in the Islamic movements of Morocco, Egypt, and elsewhere; and the Islamic experiment and its relationship with the non-Islamic world as revealed in Sudan&#39;s experience since 1989. Through these insightful accounts, Huband gives us a penetrating exploration of one of the major issues of the late twentieth century.",

        "Description": "Emphasizing flexible, counterintuitive decision making, Flip calls for a new way of doing business in an economy where conventional wisdom won't get you anywhere\"Business today requires new perspectives\"\u2014this is how Peter Sheahan, one of the youngest and fastest-rising stars on the international consulting and speaking circuit, begins this essential guidebook for succeeding in the twenty-first century. Sheahan reveals how the world's most effective organizations and individuals distinguish themselves from the competition, instead of running with the pack. In Flip he uncovers what the superstars of modern business have in common: an ability to \"flip\"\u2014to think counterintuitively and then act boldly, with no regard for \"business as usual\" conventions. Sheahan explores six major flips: Action Creates Clarity\u2014to move forward you must act in spite of ambiguity. Your action will create the clarity you're looking for.To keep pace with rising expectations, you can't just be fast, good, or cheap. Instead you must recognize that Fast, Good, Cheap: Pick Three\u2013Then Add Something Extra has become the new standard in every industry.To develop competitive advantage, you must Absolutely, Positively Sweat the Small Stuff.To satisfy customers' needs for engagement and contact\u2014spiritual, emotional, physical\u2014remember that it's not just business, Business Is Personal.To win mass-market success, Find It on the Fringe. The way to separate yourself from the competitive herd is to be courageous and create new market space.To Get Control, Give It Up. You cannot command and control customers or the talented staff needed to reach them. Instead you must empower others to create, dream, and believe for you.Sheahan teaches today's decision makers how to embrace change and successfully operate in an economy that runs on new ideas. Those who take on these lessons will be in position to join other \"flipstars\" such as Richard Branson, Google, Toyota, Rupert Murdoch, and Apple. Stick to what you learned in business school at your peril. . . . The small-world economy calls for a new way of doing business. It calls for Flip.",

She had come west to escape the swirling gossip about her broken engagement.  She had come to escape the humiliation of being jilted.  She had come here to find a welcome new life, but her cousin's chilly reception tells her she has made a terrible mistake.  Here in Riverbend, two thousand miles from Kentucky, in a town barely more than a mining camp, Holly faces the fact that she is unwanted and unwelcome.  Knowing this unhappy truth, Holly reaches another conclusion.

        "Description": "During the 1930s, the Federal Writers\u2019 Project undertook the task of locating former slaves and recording their oral histories. The more than ten thousand pages of interviews with over two thousand former slaves were filed in the Library of Congress, where they were known to scholars and historians but few others. From this storehouse of information, Belinda Hurmence has chosen twenty-seven narratives from the twelve hundred typewritten pages of interviews with 284 former South Carolina slaves. The result is a moving, eloquent, and often surprising firsthand account of the last years of slavery and first years of freedom. The former slaves describe the clothes they wore, the food they ate, the houses they lived in, the work they did, and the treatment they received. They give their impressions of Yankee soldiers, the Klan, their masters, and their newfound freedom.Belinda Hurmence was born in Oklahoma, raised in Texas, and educated at the University of Texas and Columbia University. She has written several novels for young people, including Tough Tiffany (an ALA Notable Book), A Girl Called Boy (winner of the Parents' Choice Award), and The Nightwalker. She has also edited My Folks Don't Want Me to Talk About Slavery and We Lived in a Little Cabin in the Yard, companion volumes to this book. She now lives in Raleigh, NC.",

        "Description": "In this unforgettable novel of Queen Victoria, Jean Plaidy re-creates a remarkable   life filled with romance, triumph, and tragedy. At birth, Princess Victoria was   fourth in line for the throne of England, the often-overlooked daughter of a prince   who died shortly after her birth. She and her mother lived in genteel poverty for   most of her childhood, exiled from court because of her mother\u2019s dislike of her uncles,   George IV and William IV. A strong, willful child, Victoria was determined not to   be stifled by her powerful uncles or her unpopular, controlling mother. Then one   morning, at the age of eighteen, Princess Victoria awoke to the news of her uncle   William\u2019s death. The almost-forgotten princess was now Queen of England. Even better,   she was finally free of her mother\u2019s iron hand and her uncles\u2019 manipulations. Her   first act as queen was to demand that she be given a room\u2014and a bed\u2014of her own. Victoria\u2019s marriage to her German cousin, Prince Albert, was a blissfully happy one   that produced nine children. Albert was her constant companion and one of her most   trusted advisors. Victoria\u2019s grief after Prince Albert\u2019s untimely death was so shattering   that for the rest of her life\u2014nearly forty years\u2014she dressed only in black. She survived   several assassination attempts, and during her reign England\u2019s empire expanded around   the globe until it touched every continent in the world. Derided as a mere \u201cgirl   queen\u201d at her coronation, by the end of her sixty-four-year reign, Victoria embodied   the glory of the British Empire. In this novel, written as a \u201cmemoir\u201d by Victoria   herself, she emerges as truthful, sentimental, and essentially human\u2014both a lovable   woman and a great queen.",
