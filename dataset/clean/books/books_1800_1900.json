        "Title": "Mom, Can I Move Back In With You?: A Survival Guide for Parents of Twentysomethings",
        "Authors": "By Shaffer, Susan Morris and Gordon, Linda Perlman",
        "Description": "A guide for the parents of the dazed and confused generation identified in the runaway bestseller Quarterlife Crisis.  Today's twenty-somethings are facing an unprecedented cultural shift in which they're feeling lost, uncertain about the future, and/or in crisis. What used to be the traditional markers of adulthood, from getting married and starting a family to earning a living, are increasingly being delayed-and it's causing as much confusion for parents as for their adult children. Quarterlife Crisis identified the difficulties twentysomethings are facing. But what about their parents? Guiding your twenty-something kid requires a whole new set of parenting skills. Here, finally, is a book to help parents navigate this tumultuous period in their adult children's lives.  Is it OK to let your kid move back in with you because he can't seem to commit to any one career-and therefore has no paycheck coming in? What do you do when your child calls you and says that her rent is due and she needs some quick cash? Just how involved should parents be in their adult children's lives? And what do twenty-somethings actually want and need from their parents? While parents are facing an urgent need for answers, few experts are talking about the subject, and there is little conventional wisdom to draw from. In this invaluable book, Gordon and Shaffer identify the complex issues these parents are facing and offer wise and effective strategies for successfully parenting a twenty-something \"kid.\"",

Siegel embraces a philosophy that is at the forefront of a society grappling with medical ethics and spiritual issues. His books  Love, Medicine, and Miracles (1986),  Peace, Love and Healing (1989), and  How to Live Between Office Visits (1993) have broken new ground in the field of healing. Over a span of twenty years, other physicians have become increasingly receptive to his message. Bernie's efforts have now turned toward humanizing medical care and medical education, and he continues to travel extensively with his wife, Bobbie, to speak at and run workshops, sharing his techniques and experiences. Bernie and Bobbie have five children and six grandchildren (so far).        \"This book is a continuation of the work I began when I became Bernie. It is a collection of stories about how to deal with life's difficulties. Most of the people in these stories have not had the great wake-up call; that is, they are mot facing life-threatening illnesses. So in a sense, this book is preventive medicine. It is a prescription for living that gives you effective and healthy ways of dealing with the adversity that occurs in everyone's life. I want to help you learn to accept your morality before something catastrophic brings you face-to-face with the end of your life.\"  -- From the Introduction",

        "Authors": "By Ireland, Owen S.",
        "Description": "In September 1787 the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new Federal Constitution to replace the beleaguered Articles of Confederation. Each state then had to call a convention of its own to vote on ratification. Pennsylvania, like many states, was deeply divided over the new constitution. For six months Federalists and Antifederalists fought a bitter and, on occasion, violent political battle, with the Federalists ultimately prevailing.In this detailed study of Pennsylvania, the first in fifty years, Owen S. Ireland argues that the overwhelming majority of voters in Pennsylvania favored ratification. While many modern views of the ratification conflict in America explain the Federalist success as a victory of the \"patrician\" minority over the \"plebeian\" majority, Ireland finds that political divisions were based less on class, sectional, and occupational differences than on partisan attachments rooted in religious and ethnic conflicts. The state Constitutionalist party, dominated by Presbyterians, opposed ratification, while the Anglican-led Republicans supported it. Voters from Scots-Irish and German Reformed backgrounds joined the Antifederalists, and those from virtually every other ethnic and religious group supported the Federalists.Ireland has long concentrated his scholarly work on assembling and analyzing quantitative data on politics and politicians in late eighteenth-century Pennsylvania. Here he uses the results of this research as the foundation on which to build a narrative of one of the most dramatic and significant events of the Revolutionary era.",

        "Description": "Are you ready to end the whining wars in your house?  It starts with a whimper, an insistent demand, or a certain tone of voice that every parent recognizes with dread -- your child is starting to whine, and if you don't respond properly you'll have a full-blown tantrum or argument on your hands. Kids of all ages know that whining works when they want that extra hour of TV, the unplanned toy purchase, or a later curfew. But stopping such behavior without giving in to a child's demands isn't easy, and if left unchecked, whining can lead to constant disruptions at home, in school, or anywhere else your child chooses. Now the same authors who solved a common parenting problem in the national bestseller Backtalk present three proven methods for putting an end to whining, as well as information on  * The best ways to react when your child whines in a public place * Why negotiating and giving in never work -- and what you should do instead * What kids are really trying to tell you when they whine * Why whining can lead to poor self-esteem and unsatisfying social relationships -- which can follow your child into adulthood -- and what you can do about it now * How to clearly, respectfully indicate to your child what's important to you and why whining will no longer work as a means of communication  Filled with numerous real-life examples, encouraging advice, and simple steps you can start using immediately, this invaluable guide will help you end the cycle of giving in to whining only to have your child do it again, and instead replaces misbehavior with effective, meaningful, and loving parent-child communication.",

Mitchell also follows the major players in Charismatic's life, including the family who bred him, the trainer, the owners, and the famed jockey Chris Antley, whose own story is more tragic than that of his horse. Through these interlocking stories a sense of familiarity with the key players in the industry evolves, as well as a greater understanding of the heart and soul of a sport that has fascinated human beings for centuries.",

        "Title": "Artful Work: Awakening Joy, Meaning, and Commitment in the Workplace",
        "Authors": "By Richards, Dick",
        "Description": "Work and art are not, as we have come to believe, mutually exclusive. The industrial revolution, it can be said, drove art out of work. Our new-found ability for mass production robbed workers of their art, forcing them to find \"jobs.\" Work quickly came to be viewed as something we do to survive and art merely something to hang on our walls. The reward for work became extrinsic rather than intrinsic. Instead of pursuing joy within work, we began to pursue it in leisure and in the external rewards of employment. In Artful Work, Dick Richards reminds us that all work can be artful, and that artfulness is the key to passion and commitment. He applies the assumptions of artists about work and life to the challenges facing people and organizations in today&apos;s rapidly changing world. This book provides a new perspective on those challenges that is both practical and visionary, singing a provocative new tune for those journeying to make work more meaningful and joyful, and organizations more committed to their purposes. Readers will learn to take an inspired approach to their work, renewing their experience of it as a creative, participative, and purposeful endeavor. There are seven basic assumptions of the concept of Artful Work: o All Work Can Be Artful o The Reward for Artful Work Is In the Doing o The Ambition of Artful Work Is Joy o All Work Is Spiritual Work o Artistry Demands That the Artist Own the Work Process o Artful Work Requires Consistent and Conscious Use of the Self o As the Artist Makes the Work, the Work Makes the Artist Artful Work sets forth an entirely new way of thinking about all of the work we do, and the organizations that contain our work. It offers a compelling guide to honoring artistry in our work, organizations, and leadership roles, and creating workplaces that truly honor our passion. It speaks to the courageous and hopeful among us who seek to make our work and workplaces more joyful and productive.",

        "Title": "Women Photographers at National Geographic (Direct Mail Edition)",
        "Authors": "By Newman, Cathy",
        "Description": "Photojournalism is a demanding art, even more so for female photographers than for their male colleagues: Along with the perils, and discomforts shared by every professional traveler, women all too often face other obstacles unique to their gender. But as this gloriously colorful celebration proves, the women of National Geographic have excelled behind the camera for almost a century, come hell or high water, documenting the world in arresting images that linger long in the viewer's eye.  From Eliza Scidmore, whose 1914 hand-tinted portrait immortalizes a Japanese child framed by chrysanthemums on page 18, to such famous names as Margaret Bourke-White and Dickey Chapelle, to the most gifted eyes of today, Women Photographers at National Geographic is a gallery of some 40 extraordinary visual talents and their finest work. Cathy Newman's informative text chronicles the adventures, achievements, and observations of four generations of remarkable, resourceful women: Annie Griffiths Belt, who passed herself off as a boy to capture a ceremony closed to women in Israel; Bourke-White, a figure of such romance and \u00e9lan that she inspired the television movie Double Exposure; plucky Dorothy Hosmer, whose pictures documented her 1937 bicycle tour of Romania -- and almost went unpublished because a prim male editor found the very idea unladylike.  But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is of course the photography, both in rich color and evocatively nuanced black and white: Landscapes like Edith Watson's view of Cape Breton island early in the century...portraits like Jodi Cobb's Saudi beauty, veiled but for flashing sloe eyes...scenes of lethal beauty like Dickey Chapelle's fiery Vietnamese nightmare, published only after she was killed in the field...and over 140 more, from a majestic quintet of elephants to a long-ago schoolroom of solemn, shaven-headed Russian village boys. Interspersed among the chapters are showcase portfolios of five superb contemporary women photographers, whose personal essays explore their visions and hallmark themes: \"Women on Women\" by Jodi Cobb, Maria Stenzel's \"Art of Adventure,\" Annie Griffiths Belt on \"Intimacy,\" Karen Kasmauski's gallery of \"The Human Condition,\" and Sisse Brimberg's reflections on how one links the gap \"Across Cultures.\"  As Tipper Gore aptly observes in her Foreword, \"This book marks an important milestone for photography in America. I can think of no better way to begin the millennium.\" Open this splendid volume to any page and you'll find the stunning proof in image after image you'll never forget.",

        "Description": "Tom Peters--brilliant, original, and perhaps the most inspiring and listened-to business thinker of our time--has a lot on his mind these days. And he wants to share it in The Circle of Innovation. The world of business is in a permanent state of flux, he argues, a state of chaos in which constant innovation is the only survival strategy--for the individual and for the organization. And he presents here a lifesaving handbook--both provocative and practical--designed to turn any organization into a perpetual innovation machine.In 400 seminars in 47 states and 22 countries in the last five years, Peters has reexamined, refined, and reinvented his views on innovation. Now he brings those seminars--and his passion--to the reader in a landmark book. It is meant, he writes, to both \"terrify\" and \"enlighten.\" These are \"times of matchless peril for those who fail to grasp the nettle...and times of matchless opportunity for those who do.\"To keep us alert, limber, and ready for action, he provokes and cajoles in chapter after chapter. Among his institutions and revelations:We Are All Michelangelos. He shows how to transform every \"jobholder\" into a full-fledged businessperson.All Value Comes from the Professional Services. How to convert sluggish staff units into Vital Centers of Intellectual Capital Accumulation.The System is the Solution. How to build great systems--which go far beyond nuts and bolts.Create Waves of Lust. Quality is not the automatic advantage it recently was. There is a pressing need to reverse the rising tide of product and service \"commoditization.\"Tommy Hilfiger Knows. In a crowded marketplace, branding is far more important than ever before.It's a Woman's World. How to capitalize on the fact that women purchase/are purchasing agents for well over half of U.S. commercial and consumer goods.Little Things Are the Only Things. As the Blight of Sameness encroaches on market after market, design is often the best tool in services or manufacturing for sustainable differentiation.We're Here to Live Life Out Loud. Why transformational leaders of the future must have laser-like focus, tell the truth, and live on the lunatic fringe.The hallmarks of Tom Peters legend are an insatiable curiosity, an agile intellect, a pragmatic perspective, and an uncanny ability to gauge the global zeitgeist. These qualities are all brought to bear as Peters sets out to engage, enrage, and ultimately empower his readers, amid forces that are reshaping not only business but every aspect of human experience.",

        "Title": "Between Inner Space and Outer Space: Essays on Science, Art, and Philosophy",
        "Authors": "By Barrow, John D.",
        "Description": "The origins of life on earth, the workings of the human mind, the mysteries of the Universe itself--profound questions such as these were once the province of philosophy and theology alone. Today they have become the staple--and indeed the hallmark--of the finest writing about science. And few science writers have tackled the big questions as persistently and as insightfully as astronomer John Barrow.        Now, in Between Inner Space and Outer Space, Barrow brings together dozens of essays that offer a sweeping account of his explorations along the boundary lines of science, philosophy, and religion.  Here is an invigorating tour of topics such as cosmology, evolution, Grand Unified Theories, complexity and chaos, the nature of time, super string theory, quantum mechanics, particle physics, Big Bang theory, and much more.  Barrow's range is remarkable. He examines, for instance, what science can tell us about our love of music or why certain paintings appeal to us. He recounts the dramatic discoveries made by the satellite COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) and reveals what these findings tell us about the origins of the Cosmos. He discusses the debate over the nature of the universe waged by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose. And he offers a thoughtful review of E.O. Wilson's Consilience, seconding Wilson's criticism of social scientists who remain quite ignorant of the key insights made by the life sciences.          Leavened with a sprightly sense of humor, Between Inner Space and Outer Space illuminates modern science as it provides much food for thought about life's ultimate questions.",

For this becoming-wise younger woman, this lovely journal offers words of wisdom from women who have already experienced many of life's challenges and can now reflect upon their meaning for women of all generations. Wise Women Speak is a beautifully illustrated collection of women's wisdom meant to challenge and reassure an emerging woman and give her room to reflect her own wise words.

If you believe that the outcome of these struggles affects the course of your life, and the lives around you, then this book is for you.If you believe that there are times and places when the choice an individual makes to speak or be silent, to eat or fast, to remain seated or to stand up in a crowd, to stare and remember or to walk on by and forget, can be as powerful as a president\u2019s command, a congressional appropriation, or a military incursion, then this book is for you.This book is for you if your profession is rewarding financially but not spiritually, or if you\u2019re ever worried that your career and conscience conflict.This book is for you if you are a parent whose love of your children never wavers with the anxiety they cause you but sometimes leaves you wondering whether they will grow up to do the right thing even if no one is watching.This book is for you if you question whether the countless small decisions you make each day add up to a larger judgment about your life\u2019s meaning.Finally, this book is for you if you believe that quiet, often solitary acts of conscience have echoes louder than the original sound; that individual acts have the potential to trigger large public consequences and continue to inspire others from generation to generation; that such acts bring rewards to the individual, that unforeseen benefits accrue, that one gains more than was sacrificed, and that there is a transformative power and richness to a life so lived.",

Poor, lonely, supported by a taxi-driver mother whose eccentricities spin more and more out of control, he faces the terrible task of growing up on the margins of life, destined to be a spectator of that great world always hurrying out of reach. But there is an out-of-tune piano in the small apartment, and in unlocking the secrets of its keys, as if by magic, Claude discovers himself. He is a musical prodigy.Body & Soul is the story of a young man whose life is transformed by a gift. The gift is not without price - the work is relentless, the teachers exacting - but the reward is a journey that takes him to the drawing rooms of the rich and powerful, private schools, a gilt-edged marriage, and Carnegie Hall. Claude moves through this life as if he were playing a difficult composition, swept up in its drama and tension, surprised by its grace notes. Music, here, becomes a character in its own right, equaled in strength only by the music of Frank Conroy's own unmistakable and true voice.Bristling with character and invention, Body & Soul is Dickensian in its range and richness. This is a novel with all the emotional appeal and moral gravity of a classic bildungsroman, but with a tone as contemporary as a jazz riff - an unforgettable achievement by one of the great writers of our time.",

        "Authors": "By Obermayer, Herman J.",
        "Description": "Only a small percentage of the sixteen million servicemen called up during World War II saw front-line service. For the others, war involved training, reinforcement depots, tedious assignments, and lots of waiting. Herman J. Obermayer was one of those who earned a combat star without ever coming close enough to a battlefront to hear or see booming guns. Nonetheless, his letters then, and his reflection on them now, reveal important aspects of the war and the wartime world. From school, from basic training, and later from Europe, Obermayer wrote home with vivid descriptions of life in the Army. Reflective and observant, he recorded his views of both French and German reactions to the American occupation force, race relations among enlisted men, and the problems of supplying the troops as they crossed Europe after the Normandy invasion. One of the few people alive today to have seen Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess, and other leaders of Third Reich, Obermayer wrote compellingly about the Nazis on trial at Nuremberg, describing Goering\u2019s leadership qualities when stripped of the symbols of rank. A Jew himself, Obermayer explained his reactions at the trials when he witnessed the first documentary confirmation that six million Jews had been killed in the Holocaust. He knew and wrote about the official U.S. Army hangman at Nuremberg. Readers will find in Obermayer\u2019s letters and connective commentary a welcome tendency to look for what went on beneath the surface, a challenging view of how his experiences cast light on today\u2019s politics and issues, and an engrossingly human story of war behind the lines.",

        "Description": "The classic motivational parable (over 500,000 copies sold worldwide) that shows you how to make your own opportunities in life, updated for the modern reader by bestselling business author Alan Axelrod Ever since its first printing by William Randolph Hearst in 1921, The Go-Getter has inspired employees and entrepreneurs to take initiative, increase their productivity, and excel against the odds. Now, more than half a million copies later, Alan Axelrod, bestselling author of Patton on Leadership and Elizabeth I, CEO, updates the tale to address today's most pressing work issues.In The Go-Getter, Bill Peck, a war veteran, persuades Cappy Ricks, the influential founder of the Rick's Logging & Lumbering Company, to let him prove himself by selling skunk wood in odd lengths-a job that everyone knows can only lead to failure. When Peck goes on to beat his quota, Rick hands Peck the ultimate opportunity and the ultimate test: the quest for an elusive blue vase. Drawing on such classic values as honesty, determination, passion, and responsibility, Peck overcomes nearly insurmountable obstacles to find the vase and launch hia career as a successful manager.In a time when jobs are tight and managers are too busy for mentoring, how can you maintain positive energy, take control of your career, and prepare yourself to ace the tests that come your way? By applying the timeless lessons in this compulsively readable parable, employees at all levels can learn to rekindle the go-getter in themselves.",

Are you sick and tired of the tax-cutting, environment-desecrating, secret-keeping, influence-peddling, war-mongering, free speech-hating hypocrites who occupy America's halls of power? If so, you have company -- James Carville.Like James Carville, America has been bruised and battered by the Republicans who are running our country and running it into the ground. The Bush administration has squandered a five-trillion-dollar surplus and created a five-trillion-dollar projected deficit. Their tax cut for the rich was supposed to create jobs -- but instead America has lost more than three million of them. This administration was supposed to bring honor and dignity to the White House but instead brought lies, leaks, secrecy, and fear. They promised to make the country stronger and safer but instead they've left us overstretched, isolated, and insecure.And Carville has had enough.In Had Enough? the legendary political adviser comes out of his corner swinging, taking on the Bush White House and the Republican leaders in Congress on every front -- from the economy to education to foreign affairs. But he doesn't just attack; he lays out constructive \"had enough\" solutions for healing the damage done by the Republicans and helping disheartened Democrats get back on their feet. In addition, he offers \"Ten Rules for Progressives to Live By\" and a new War Room mantra for a new era.Had Enough? is a rousing handbook for taking back the country, for fighting back the right wing, and for returning the power to the people.",

        "Description": "An all-American collection of essays on the pivotal moments in our nation's history by award-winning historians, the third in the bestselling series.  The \"what if\" concept is one of the most original and engaging on the current history bookshelf. The essays are chock-full of provocative ideas; they are as accessible to the general reader as they are to the scholar; and they are the perfect gift for the dedicated history buff on anyone's list.  In this new collection of never-before-published essays, our brightest historians speculate about some of America's more intriguing crossroads. Some irresistible highlights include: Caleb Carr (The Alienist) on America had there been no Revolution; Tom Wicker on the first time a vice president, John Tyler, succeeded a deceased president and its surprising ramifications; Jay Winik (April 1865) on the havoc that might have resulted if Booth had succeeded in his plan to assassinate Johnson and Seward as well as Lincoln; Antony Beevor (The Fall of Berlin 1945) on the possibility of Eisenhower's capture of Berlin before the Soviets' arrival there in 1945; and Robert Dallek (the upcoming An Unfinished Life about John F. Kennedy) on one of the most agonizing American \"what if\"s of all: what might have happened if JFK hadn't been assassinated.",

As our first technology for contemplation of the self, the mirror is arguably as important an invention as the wheel. Mirror Mirror is the fascinating story of the mirror's invention, refinement, and use in an astonishing range of human activities--from the fantastic mirrored rooms that wealthy Romans created for their orgies to the mirror's key role in the use and understanding of light. Pendergrast spins tales of the 2,500year mystery of whether Archimedes and his \"burning mirror\" really set faraway Roman ships on fire; the medieval Venetian glassmakers, who perfected the technique of making large, flat mirrors from clear glass and for whom any attempt to leave their cloistered island was punishable by death; Isaac Newton, whose experiments with sunlight on mirrors once left him blinded for three days; the artist David Hockney, who holds controversial ideas about Renaissance artists and their use of optical devices; and George Ellery Hale, the manic-depressive astronomer and telescope enthusiast who inspired (and gave his name to) the twentieth century's largest ground-based telescope. Like mirrors themselves, Mirror Mirror is a book of endless wonder and fascination.",
