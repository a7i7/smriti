Drawing on the most recent data from the U.S. Census, this groundbreaking work offers a detailed geographic and demographic portrait of gay and lesbian families in all 50 states plus the top 25 U.S. metropolitan areas. These results, presented in more than 250 full-color maps and charts, will both confirm and challenge anecdotal information about the spatial distribution and demographic characteristics of this community. It is probably no surprise that San Francisco, Key West, and western Massachusetts all host large gay and lesbian populations, but it might surprise some that Houston, Texas, contains one of the ten \"gayest\" neighborhoods in the country, or that Alaska and New Mexico have high concentrations of gay and lesbian couples in their senior populations. The Atlas is a unique and important resource for the political and public policy communities, public health officials, social scientists, and anyone interested in gay and lesbian issues",

Death of a Pooh-BahA long-lost aunt's invitation brings Phoebe to Northampton, Massachusetts, and a post as stage manager of a lively community production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado. But beneath the operetta's sweet harmonies and rollicking whimsy, she observes more than one sour note. Many in the cast have a grudge against Dr. E. Foster Ballard, whose pompous self-absorption makes him perfect for his role as Lord Pooh-Bah. But who hates him enough to stab him in the back with his own prized Japanese dagger? Could it be the feminist militants who've been protesting The Mikado's misogynist lyrics? His catty ex? Or one of the Three Little Maids who've had enough of his wandering hands? And what dark history did Phoebe's own aunt have with Ballard? Soon another corpse suggests E. Foster's killer has got a little list...and Phoebe's inquiries may just have put her at the top of it.",

        "Description": "Baltimore 1966. Suffering through a summer of heated racial animosity, baseball fans look hungrily to the Orioles to bring new respect to their once-great city. Their young team of no-name kids and promising prospects appears to have been strengthened by the recent addition of veteran slugger Frank Robinson - but the former National League MVP is bad news (it is rumored), washed up and unreliable. To lay these rumors to rest, Robby must play harder than he's ever played before. In his first year in the league, against unfamiliar pitchers in new ballparks, he resoundingly proves his worth - to his city, his team, and himself - by delivering a Triple Crown performance. Aided by a hilarious and memorable cast of characters - the gentlemanly southerner Brooks Robinson and the wickedly inventive prankster Moe Drabowsky, a pitching staff of unknown kids like Jim Palmer and Dave McNally, and a gargantuan yet nimble fielder called \"Boog\" - Frank Robinson delivers his new team to its first World Series. But before they take it all, the Orioles must unseat the reigning champion Los Angeles Dodgers.With America's cities in mounting turmoil, Los Angeles seems like another world altogether, a sunny land of surfers and movie stars. Comfortably dwelling in this higher plane is pitching ace Sandy Koufax, arguably the greatest lefthander in baseball history, behind whom the Dodgers have won two of the previous three World Series, replacing the Yankees as the sport's dominant team. Though battling agonizing arthritis throughout the season, the godlike Koufax has nonetheless persevered to win twenty-seven games in 1966, a personal best. Few outside Baltimore give the Orioles more than a fighting chance against such series veterans as Koufax, Don Drysdale, Maury Wills, Tommy Davis, and the rest. Experts are betting that the Dodgers can sweep it in four.What transpires instead astonishes the nation, as the greatest pitching performance in World Series history is capped by a redemption beyond imagining.",
