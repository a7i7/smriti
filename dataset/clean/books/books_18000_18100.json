        "Description": "Call me naive, but when I was a girl - watching James Bond movies and devouring Harriet the Spy - all I wanted was to grow up to be a spy. Unlike most kids, I didn't lose my secret-agent aspirations when I became an adult. So as a bright-eyed, idealistic college grad, I sent my resume to the CIA. My dad - who I secretly suspected was a spy himself - told me I wasn't their type. That only made me more determined.Getting into the CIA was a story in itself. I peed in more cups than you could imagine, and was nearly condemned as a sexual deviant by the staff psychologist. I passed a lie-detector test in which a previous applicant allegedly admitted that he'd dismembered his wife and buried her in the basement. Meanwhile, my roommates were getting freaked out by government background investigators lurking around, asking questions about my past.Finally I made it: I was in training to be a CIA case officer. A spy. They taught me to crash cars into barriers at sixty miles per hour. Jump out of airplanes with cargo attached to my body. Survive interrogation, travel in alias, lose a tail.One thing they didn't teach us was how to date a guy while lying to him about what you do for a living, where you live, and your entire identity. That I had to figure out for myself.But I passed it all (except the dating part) with flying colors, much to my father's amazement. Then I was posted overseas. And that's when the real fun began...and when I began to truly understand that being a spy was nothing at all like I'd expected.",

I. Warshawski, who's been called \"the most engaging woman in detective fiction since Dorothy Sayers's Harriet Vane\" (Newsweek), \"the detective mystery fans have been waiting for\" (Time), and \"a gumshoe for modern times\" (People).",

For Adam, living near Honolulu, this Sunday morning is one he has been looking forward to -- fishing with friends, away from the ever-watchful eyes of his father, a navy lieutenant. Then, right before his eyes, Adam watches Japanese planes fly overhead and attack the U.S. Navy. All he can think is that it's just like in the movies. But as he sees his father's ship, the Arizona, sink beneath the water, he realizes this isn't make-believe. It's real.  Over the next few days, Adam searches for answers -- about his friends, the war, and especially, his father. But Adam soon learns sometimes there are no answers.",

Paula and Al have grown up in affluence: Al as the son of the town's most successful citizen, its mayor and newspaper owner; Paula as the pampered daughter of an entrepreneurial mother in St. Louis, part of a set of well-to-do black families whose children go to the best schools, attend dancing classes together, and socialize with one another. When we meet them, Al is reluctantly running for mayor, the twins are feuding, and Paula is hanging on.Then Paula's cantankerous mother-in-law, Miss Xenobia Kezee, sick and old, arrives from St. Paul, where she has lived since the death of her beloved second husband. Miss Kezee is independent. She is blunt, tough, and opinionated. She wants to go home, away from memories of her first husband, Al's father, and she openly resents Paula's well-intended caregiving.As Paula struggles to move from antagonism to common ground with Miss Kezee, she faces the substantial issues in her life: her own mother's lonely death, which still haunts her; and her husband's minimal engagement with the emotional life of his family. In Somebody Else's Mama, David Haynes beautifully unfolds a story of the yearning for a significant family life.",

        "Description": "The assault and capture of Iraq \u2014 and the resistance it has provoked \u2014 will shape the politics of the twenty-first century. In this passionate and provocative book, Tariq Ali provides a history of Iraqi resistance against empires old and new, and argues against the view that sees imperialist occupation as the only viable solution to bring about regime-change in corrupt and dictatorial states. Like the author\u2019s previous work, The Clash of Fundamentalisms, this book presents a magnificent cultural history.Detailing the longstanding imperial ambitions of key figures in the Bush administration and how war profiteers close to Bush are cashing in, Bush in Babylon is unique in moving beyond the corporate looting by the US military government to offer the reader an expert and in-depth analysis of the extent of resistance to the US occupation in Iraq.On 15 February 2003, eight million people marched on the streets of five continents against a war that had not yet begun. A historically unprecedented number of people rejected official justifications for war that the secular Ba'ath Party of Iraq was connected to al-Qaeda or that \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d existed in the region, outside of Israel.More people than ever are convinced that the greatest threat to peace comes from the center of the American empire and its satrapies, with Blair and Sharon as lieutenants to the Commander-in-Chief. Examining how countries from Japan to France eventually rushed to support US aims, as well as the futile UN resistance, Tariq Ali proposes a re-founding of Mark Twain's mammoth American Anti-Imperialist League (which included William James, W.E.B. DuBois, William Dean Howells, and John Dewey) to carry forward the antiwar movement. Meanwhile, as Iraqis show unexpected hostility and independence, rather than gratitude, for \u201cliberation,\u201d Ali is unique is uncovering the depth of the resistance now occurring inside occupied Iraq.",

Daniel Leary has earned promotion, but the needs of the Republic and the RCN require that he serve under an officer whose paranoia has already led him to execute crewmen out of hand. Signals Officer Adele Mundy has repeatedly proved her skills and loyalty as Cinnabar's most accomplished intelligence agent, but now elements within the Republic want to draw her into a conspiracy like the one that led to her parent's massacre. Leary and Mundy battle their way from riot-torn streets to spies in an outlying base and an anarchic planet where violence is the only law, but if they succeed at every stage, one test still remains: a space battle against an overwhelming Alliance force.

One side escalates and the other follows suit. As the spiral grows it is undermining the soul of democracy. But here's the good news: the majority of Americans want a new system of campaign finance. Every time voters have had a chance to choose a different way, they have spoken loud and clear. Clean money initiatives are proving the citizens' response to the corruption that has turned our elections into auctions. This book is the blueprint to returning democracy to politics.\" \u2014Bill Moyers As we approach our next presidential election, few issues loom larger than campaign finance reform. While the Senate has agreed to vote on a sweeping bill for reform at the federal level, state voters have passed, or are about to vote on, ballots that limit the amount of private money flooding into campaign war chests. Money and Politics argues that only the full public funding of elections, as enacted with the adoption in Maine of the Clean Elections Act, can solve our campaign financing crisis. Their evaluation of its pros and cons is particularly timely as parts of the Maine option are being considered in competing congressional reform bills. Many of the contributors to this volume have worked closely on campaign finance reform, including Senator Russell Feingold, coauthor of the landmark McCain-Feingold Act.Persuasive, accessible, and controversial, this book makes an important contribution to our debate about the most democratic way to elect the politicians who represent us.NEW DEMOCRACY FORUM A series of short paperback originals exploring creative solutions to our most urgent national concerns. The series editors (for Boston Review), Joshua Cohen and Joel Rogers, aim to foster politically engaged, intellectually honest, and morally serious debate about fundamental issues\u2014both on and off the agenda of conventional politics.",

Suddenly his life was thrown into chaos when the company that controlled his patent was sold out from under him, and instead of imminent wealth, Cory was facing immediate poverty. Then along came Alan Stark, who wanted to recruit Cory for a special research project on virtual reality.Stark was reviving the secret NSA work of the legendary Matthew Brand, who had disappeared under mysterious circumstances years before. Cory had always idolized Brand, so he was initially thrilled to be involved. But he quickly discovered that there was nothing virtual about the realities he was working on. Instead, he found that Stark was on the verge of controlling the very fabric of reality itself.Cory was unsure of Stark\u2019s ultimate goal, until he began to recall pieces of another life and found himself in the middle of a battle between two groups of people who could use \u201crabbit holes\u201d in space and time to jump between different realities, personalities, and lives.

        "Description": "There may be no more fascinating historical period than the  late fourteenth century in Europe. The Hundred Years' War ravaged  the continent, yet gallantry, chivalry, and literary brilliance  flourished in the courts of England and elsewhere. Chaucer wrote  brilliant satire, lords and ladies invented courtly rituals of  love and romance, yet the vast bulk of Europe's population  struggled with plague, economic uncertainty, and violence. It was  a world in transition, soon to be replaced by the Renaissance and  the Age of Exploration -- and John of Gaunt was its central  figure. Norman F. Cantor, the best known and most popular  historian of the Middle Ages, brings Gaunt to life brilliantly in  his newest work, The Last Knight.   John of Gaunt was the richest man in Europe, apart from its  monarchs, and he epitomized and surpassed the ideals of the late  Middle Ages. From chivalry -- he was taught at a young age to  fight on horseback like the knights of old -- to courtly love --  his three marriages included two romantic love-matches -- he was  an ideal leader. He created lavish courts, sponsoring Chaucer and  proto-Protestant religious thinkers, and he survived the dramatic  Peasants' Revolt, during which his sumptuous London residence was  burned to the ground. As the head of the Lancastrian Branch of  the Plantagenet family, he was the unknowing father of the War of  the Roses, for his son Henry Bolingbroke usurped the crown from  Gaunt's nephew, Richard II, after Gaunt had died. He passed away  just as one great era gave way to the next: His grandson Henry  the Navigator launched the Age of Exploration. Gaunt's adventures  represent the culture and mores of the Middle Ages as few others'  do, and his death is portrayed by Cantor as the end of that  fascinating period.",

Now, four years later, twenty-nine-year-old Julie is far too young to have given up on love. She may be ready to risk caring for someone again. But who?Should it be Richard Franklin, the sophisticated, handsome engineer who treats her like a queen? Or Mike Harris, the down-to-earth nice guy who was her husband's best friend? Choosing one of them should bring her more happiness than she's had in years.

        "Authors": "By Jacoby, Russell",
        "Description": "This provocative book chronicles the disappearance of the \"public intellectual\" in America. For over thirty years, the cultural landscape has been dominated by the generation of Irving Howe, Daniel Bell, and John Kenneth Galbraith; no younger group has arisen to succeed them. Unlike earlier intellectuals who lived in urban bohemias and wrote for the educated public, today's thinkers have flocked to the universities, where the politics of tenure loom larger than the politics of culture. In an incisive and passionate polemic, Russell Jacoby examines how gentrification, suburbanization, and academic careerism have sapped the vitality of American intellectual life.",

Tantrums  Listen. Acknowledge the source of frustration.  Whisper in your child's ear. The screaming may stop or turn into a giggle. Disappear into another room. You'll feel better and the tantrum will lose steam.   Hair Care  Sit your child in a high chair to prevent \"wandering.\" Spread a newspaper underneath.  Remove gum from hair with peanut butter. Work it into the hair and then comb out both gum and peanut butter.",

        "Title": "The Witch Doctors",
        "Authors": "By Micklethwait, John and Wooldridge, Adrian",
        "Description": "Management gurus - high-powered consulting firms, business school professors, motivational speakers who never graduated from high school - are latterday witch doctors, each promising the cure for what ails corporate America. These men and women are the sales reps for an industry that exists exclusively to peddle freshly laid management advice to petrified executives. According to one recent study, 72 percent of managers believe that the right management tools can help ensure business success, even though 70 percent also say most of the tools promise more than they deliver. Often, the results are thousands of people losing their jobs or having their work lives irrevocably altered. But thousands of companies continue to grasp at the newest concept du jour - until the next sure thing comes along.The irony is that some of the gurus' ideas and prescriptions really can rescue or renovate your company. But until you have read The Witch Doctors, your chances of figuring out which ideas belong in your hot file and which in your circular file are slim indeed.Micklethwait and Wooldridge have organized The Witch Doctors around the management problems that plague today's corporations. They examine the promise and the problems of reengineering, and analyze what - and who - is driving the current boom in the management industry. The authors profile Peter Drucker and Tom Peters, helping you decide what the uber-gurus can teach you and what they can't. They proceed to look deeply into the social and corporate implications of every major conundrum managers and workers face today. Through unbiased, often contrarian investigations of knowledge, learning, and innovation, strategy and vision, the future of the workplace, shareholder versus stakeholder capitalism, globalization, and Japanese management, Micklethwait and Wooldridge tell you what works, what fails, and what the future may hold for those who act and those who wait. Two groundbreaking chapters examine the inroads management theory is making in the public sector, and the unexpected paths Asian managers are blazing through the world economy.",

        "Title": "The Millionaire Mind",
        "Authors": "By Stanley, Thomas J.",
        "Description": "In his first best-seller, Dr. Thomas J. Stanley shattered one of contemporary America's most firmly held myths: That wealthy individuals belong to an elite group of the highly educated and exceedingly lucky who often inherit their money and spend it on lavish purchases and pampered lifestyles. In fact, a significant number of America's wealthy are far more likely to work hard, save diligently, and live well below their means. As the title of  Stanley's 1996 best-selling book stated, they are The Millionaire Next Door. Now, Dr. Stanley takes us even further with a new, ground-breaking study of America's wealthy. In THE MILLIONAIRE MIND he targets a different segment of the population and those who have accumulated substantial wealth and live in ways that openly demonstrate their affluence. Exploring the ideas, beliefs and behaviors that enabled these millionaires to build and maintain their fortunes, Dr. Stanley provides a fascinating look at who America's financial elite are and how they got there. What were their school days like? How did they respond to negative criticism? What are the characteristics of the millionaire's spouse? Is religion an important part of their lives? The author uncovers the surprising answers to these and similar questions, showing readers through concrete examples just what it is that makes the wealthy prosper when others would turn away dejected or beaten. The Millionaire Mind promises to be as transformational as Dr. Stanley's previous best- seller. This book answers universal questions with solid statistical evidence in an approachable, and anecdotal style. The number of copies sold of this soon-to-be-classic will surely be in\u00e6the millions.",
