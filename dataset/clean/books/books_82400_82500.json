        "Authors": "By Ragen, Naomi",
        "Description": "Sotah is the story of beautiful, fragile Dina Reich, a young woman in Jerusalem's ultrareligious haredi enclave who is accused of the community's most unforgivable sin: adultery. The hallmark of the haredim is their adherence to the letter of Jewish law, and they are thus cocooned in tradition and observance. But the law is a double-edged sword that also subjects Dina to a modern version of the biblically ordained public ordeal that will either vindicate or destroy her completely.Although Dina was brought up to be an obedient daughter and dutiful wife, she has yearnings - for knowledge, for romance, for excitement - that she knows her life will never satisfy. In her willing but arranged marriage, Dina finds these deeply repressed passions increasingly difficult to ignore. Even her loving and generous husband cannot completely satisfy her, and, eventually, her frustration finds a dangerous outlet in a sudden and intense obsession with a married man. But when the flirtation is exposed by the community's self-appointed vigilantes, Dina is separated from her husband and child and forced to leave the country. In New York City, the freedom and the shallowness of modern American life appall Dina, but they also inspire her to fashion her own tradition, one that will enable her to confront her accusers and reclaim her life.",

Many have identified with the main character's Great Sadness, the terrible burden of grief that often accompanies and follows a deep loss, for the Great Sadness is part of the human condition. And it compels us to ask, Where is God? Who is God?Roger Olson, who has faced his own Great Sadness, finds a good deal of comfort in this much beloved, story as have so many others. Some may ask, however, Is God really like that? Is that really how God responds to evil? Can God be trusted?Olson also views The Shack with a theologian's eye and finds much sound truth. He delves into many of the significant issues raised by the book such as forgiving those who have done us great evil, how God acts in the world, how God is three persons in one and what difference this makes to us. While he offers his own criticisms of the book, he largely finds the truth about God in The Shack.",

Smith seamlessly combines a memoir whose intimacy matches that of Angela's Ashes with the tale of a community plagued by a malevolent predator that holds the emotional and cultural resonance of The Lovely Bones.Smith's Hartford neighborhood is small-town America, where everyone\u2019s door is unlocked and the school, church, library, drugstore, 5 & 10, grocery, and tavern are all within walking distance. Her family is peopled with memorable characters\u2014her possibly psychic mother who's always on the verge of a nervous breakdown, her adoring father who makes sure she has something to eat in the morning beyond her usual gulp of Hershey\u2019s syrup, her grandfather who teaches her to bash in the heads of the eels they catch on Long Island Sound, Uncle Guido who makes the annual bagna cauda, and the numerous aunts and cousins who parade through her life with love and food and endless stories of the old days. And then there\u2019s her brother, Tyler. Smith's household was \u201cdifferent.\u201d Little Mary-Ann couldn't have friends over because her older brother, Tyler, an autistic before anyone knew what that meant, was unable to bear noise of any kind. To him, the sound of crying, laughing, phones ringing, or toilets flushing was \u201ca cloud of barbed needles\u201d flying into his face. Subject to such an assault, he would substitute that pain with another: he'd try to chew his arm off. Tyler was Mary-Ann's real-life Boo Radley, albeit one whose bookshelves sagged under the weight of the World War II books he collected and read obsessively. Hanging over this rough-and-tumble American childhood is the sinister shadow of an approaching serial killer. The menacing Bob Malm lurks throughout this joyous and chaotic family portrait, and the havoc he unleashes when the paths of innocence and evil cross one early December evening in 1953 forever alters the landscape of Smith's childhood. Girls of Tender Age is one of those books that will forever change its readers because of its beauty and power and remarkable wit.",

Now, with coauthor and wife Helen LaKelly Hunt, he brings us to a new understanding about one of the most complicated issues facing couples today:  Receiving Love  Many men and women know how to give love, but many more undermine their relationships by never having learned how to accept it. We don't always realize the ways in which we reject appreciation and affection, help and guidance from our romantic partners. And, according to Hendrix and Hunt, until we are able to understand the meaning behind our behavior, our relationships stand to suffer. Ask yourself:  Are you reluctant to tell your partner what you really want or need?  When you do get what you've asked for, do you still feel dissatisfied?  Is it difficult for you to accept kind gestures, gifts, or compliments from your partner?  If you answered yes to any of the above, this book is for you. With Receiving Love, you can learn how to break the shackles of self-rejection -- which likely began in childhood, when our caretakers unintentionally failed to nurture us -- and embrace real intimacy. Drawing on their renowned expertise, the wide clinical experience of Imago therapists, and their own personal experience as a married couple, the authors offer detailed, sensitive advice on how to turn a relationship between two well-meaning yet misunderstood individuals into a true, everlasting partnership.",

        "Description": "In The Congress Dictionary, renowned word maven Paul Dickson and veteran congressional reporter Paul Clancy serve up a generous portion of the \"rich stew of history\" that is, according to former House speaker Tip O'Neill, the vocabulary of Congress.Encyclopedic reference, political junkie's handbook, browser's delight, The Congress Dictionary tackles the language of Capitol Hill on its own terms, by turns ribald and witty, subtle and clear. With definitions of more than 3,000 terms, phrases, names, and symbols, the Dictionary is an indispensable resource for reporters, researchers, students of government, and just about anyone interested in the ways and language of American government and the high-stakes game of national politics.Including terms such as wonk, tree-huggers, guardians of gridlock, death-squad Democrat, supply-side economics, College of Cardinals, and Beltway bandit, the entries encompass the provocative and the sublime, stodgy legalese and racy cloakroom banter. Ranging from the beginnings of the Republic to the Clinton administration, each entry imparts valuable information while telling its own unique and fascinating story.Exhaustive etymologies - three pages devoted to \"caucus\" alone - include narrative historical accounts and amusing anecdotes that reveal as much about the history and evolution of American politics as about the words themselves.Throughout, the text is lavishly supplemented with marginalia containing intriguing facts - for instance, congressional pay scales from 1789 to the present - colorful quips, and more than 100 illustrations, including vintage political cartoons, archive photos, and historical artifacts - everything from a facsimile ticket to the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson, to a news photo of President Clinton making his first pilgrimage to Capitol Hill.In addition to defining the words, names, and phrases used in the day-to-day workings of our government's liveliest branch, Dickson and Clancy explain the most arcane and complex legislative procedures in plain English.An A-to-Z treasure trove of information, a researcher's dream, and a pundit's delight, The Congress Dictionary is the definitive reference work for political insiders and outsiders, those who want to know and those who need to know what is going on at the center of American government and politics.",

        "Description": "\"We may take Full of Grace as a personal guidebook. Using a conversational tone, Judith Dupre brings together art, quotations, religious history, and secular references to show how the courage and beauty of the mother of Jesus may be found within us all.\"---Ana Castillo, American Book Award-winning author of So Far from God\"Given all that the Virgin Mary has meant to people over the centuries, trying to imagine her is as impossible an undertaking as trying to imagine Woman herself. Yet thousands of artists have managed to do so with brilliant specificity. Judith Dupre has gathered together some of their art, along with specific imaginings of her own, in a beautiful and provocative introduction to one of the most resonant figures in religious history.\"---Judith Shulevitz, author of The Sabbath WorldTwo thousand years ago, a girl from Nazareth was transformed by a simple \"yes\" into the Mother of God---the subject of sublime devotion, divisive controversy, and extravagant speculation. A mother and a virgin, a saint and a peasant, a woman both tragic and triumphant, Mary has held sway over the human imagination for centuries. Yet she has never felt as relevant to our everyday lives as she does today.In Full of Grace, Judith Dupre, the bestselling author of Churches, offers an intimate exploration of this beloved figure, now and through the ages. In a series of poignant stories and essays, Dupre examines Mary's artistic, cultural, and historical influence, and at the same time shows how Mary's human journey of love, compassion, grief, and humble strength inextricably connects her to our modern lives.Accompanied by a breathtaking visual feast ranging from classic Renaissance portraits to unexpected contemporary images, Dupre's text offers insights into the Virgin Mary as a mother and as a religious icon. Visits to the great shrines of Marian pilgrimage---Lourdes, Medjugorje, Fatima, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe---underscore the author's journey to find Mary's meaning in her own life. In an essay about Mary in the Qur'an, we see how Mary, far from being an exculsively Catholic figure, emerges as one of the central women in Islam. Another piece details the author's travels in the Holy Land, a landscape wracked by religious strife but still overflowing with the spirit of generosity that Mary embodies. From Sudanese refugee camps to the painful reminders of Auschwitz, from the struggle of divorce to the challenges of raising a child with autism, we see how Mary's tenderness, bravery, and grace infuse the story of every mother, young and old. For men and women seeking to better understand their own life journey, this book looks at the many miracles, large and small, along the way.",

        "Authors": "By Nathan, Joan",
        "Description": "What is Jewish cooking in France?That is the question that has haunted Joan Nathan over the years and driven her to unearth the secrets of this hidden cuisine. Now she gives us the fruits of her quest in this extraordinary book, a treasure trove of delectable kosher recipes and the often moving stories behind them, interlaced with the tumultuous two-thousand-year history of the Jewish presence in France.In her search, Nathan takes us into kitchens in Paris, Alsace, and the Loire Valley; she visits the bustling Belleville market in Little Tunis in Paris; she breaks bread around the observation of the Sabbath and the celebration of special holidays. All across France she finds that Jewish cooking is more alive than ever. Traditional dishes are honored, yet many have acquired a French finesse and reflect regional differences. The influx of Jewish immigrants from North Africa following Algerian independence has brought exciting new flavors and techniques that have infiltrated contemporary French cooking, and the Sephardic influence is more pronounced throughout France today.Now, with Joan Nathan guiding us, carefully translating her discoveries to our own home kitchens, we can enjoy:\u2022 appetizers such as the rich subtle delight of a Terrine de Poireaux from Alsace or a brik, that flaky little pastry from North Africa, folded over a filling of tuna and cilantro;\u2022 soups such as cold sorrel or Moroccan Proven\u00e7al Fish Soup with garlicky Rouille; \u2022 salads include a Mediterranean Artichoke and Orange Salad with Saffron Mint and a Tunisian Winter Squash Salad with Coriander and Harissa;\u2022 a variety of breads, quiches, and kugels\u2014try a Brioche for Rosh Hashanah, a baconless quiche Lorraine, or a Sabbath kugel based on a centuries-old recipe;\u2022 main courses of Choucroute de Poisson; a tagine with chicken and quince; Brisket with Ginger, Orange Peel, and Tomato; Southwestern Cassoulet with Duck and Lamb; Tongue with Capers and Cornichons; and Almondeguilles (Algerian meatballs);\u2022 an inviting array of grains, pulses, couscous, rice, and unusual vegetable dishes, from an eggplant gratin to a m\u00e9lange of Chestnuts, Onions, and Prunes;\u2022 for a grand finale, there are Parisian flans and tarts, a Frozen Souffl\u00e9 Rothschild, and a Hanukkah Apple Cake, as well as many other irresistible pastries and cookies.These are but some of the treasures that Joan Nathan gives us in this unique collection of recipes and their stories. In weaving them together, she has created a book that is a testament to the Jewish people, who, despite waves of persecution, are an integral part of France today, contributing to the glory of its cuisine.",

He doesn\u2019t understand how the police and prosecutors got the wrong man, and he certainly doesn\u2019t care. He just can\u2019t believe his good luck. Time passes and he realizes that the mistake will not be corrected: the authorities believe in their case and are determined to get a conviction. He may even watch the trial of the person wrongly accused of his crime. He is relieved when the verdict is guilty. He laughs when the police and prosecutors congratulate themselves. He is content to allow an innocent person to go to prison, to serve hard time, even to be executed.  Travis Boyette is such a man. In 1998, in the small East Texas city of Sloan, he abducted, raped, and strangled a popular high school cheerleader. He buried her body so that it would never be found, then watched in amazement as police and prosecutors arrested and convicted Dont\u00e9 Drumm, a local football star, and marched him off to death row. Now nine years have passed. Travis has just been paroled in Kansas for a different crime; Dont\u00e9 is four days away from his execution. Travis suffers from an inoperable brain tumor. For the first time in his miserable life, he decides to do what\u2019s right and confess. But how can a guilty man convince lawyers, judges, and politicians that they\u2019re about to execute an innocent man?",

        "Description": "In a reinterpretation of the postwar years, historian Robert Dallek examines what drove the leaders of the most powerful nations around the globe--Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Mao, de Gaulle, and Truman--to rely on traditional power politics despite thecatastrophic violence their nations had endured. The decisions of these men, for better and often for worse, had profound consequences for decades to come, influencing relations and conflicts with China, Korea, the Middle East, and around the globe. Thisbook is a penetrating look at the misjudgments that caused enormous strife and suffering during this critical period, from the closing months of World War II through the early years of the Cold War. The men who led the world at this time executed astonishingly unwise actions that propelled the nuclear arms race and extended the Cold War. Dallek has written a cautionary tale that considers what might have been done differently.--From publisher description.",

His problems begin when he falls hook, line, and sinker for a fake story from an unreliable source and repeats it on a radio program. As a result of his flip comments, Gus becomes embroiled in a nasty slander suit brought by Kyle Cramden, the powerful congressman he accuses of being involved in the mysterious disappearance of a young woman, and he fears it could mean the end of him.The stress of the lawsuit makes it difficult for Gus to focus on the novel he has been contracted to write, which is based on the suspicious death of billionaire Konstantin Zacharias. It is a story that hasdominated the party conversations of Manhattan's chattering classes for more than two years. The convicted murderer is behind bars, but Gus is not convinced that justice was served. There are too many unanswered questions, such as why a paranoid man who was usually accompanied by bodyguards was without protection the very night he perished in a tragic fire.Konstantin's hot-tempered widow, Perla, is obsessed with climbing the social ladder and, as a result, she will do anything to suppress this potentially damaging story. Gus is convinced she is the only thing standing between him and the truth. Dominick Dunne revives the world he first introduced in his mega-bestselling novel People Like Us, and he brings readers up to date on favorite characters such asRuby and Elias Renthal, Lil Altemus, and, of course, the beloved Gus Bailey. Once again, he invites us to pull up a seat at the most important tables at Swifty's, get past the doormen at esteemed social clubs like The Butterfield, and venture into the innermost chambers of the Upper East Side's most sumptuous mansions.Too Much Money is a satisfying, mischievous, and compulsively readable tale by the most brilliant society chronicler of our time?the man who knew all the secrets and wasn't afraid to share them.",

A beautiful but guarded woman who feels more at ease wading through the marshes than lounging on the porches of the fashionable resort her sister and brother-in-law own, Elsie was never one to do as she was told. She is wary of the discomfort her presence poses among some members of her gossipy, insular community, yet it is Rose, the unofficially adopted daughter and little sister of half the town, who magnetically steers everyone in her orbit toward unexpected\u2014and unbreakable\u2014relationships. As we see Rose grow from a child to a plucky adolescent with a flair for theatrics both onstage and at home during verbal boxing matches with her mother, to a poised and prepossessing teenager, she becomes the unwitting emotional tether between Elsie and everyone else. \u201cFace it, Mom,\u201d Rose says, \u201cwe live in a tiny ecosystem.\u201d And indeed, like the rugged, untouched marshes that surround these characters, theirs is an ecosystem that has come by its beauty honestly, through rhythms and moods that have shaped and reshaped their lives.With an uncanny ability to plunge confidently and unwaveringly into the thoughts and desires of women\u2014mothers, daughters, wives, lovers\u2014John Casey astonishes us again with the power of a family saga.",
