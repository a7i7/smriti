Drawing on lessons learned from working with more than 15,000 small, medium-sized, and very large organisations, Gerber has discovered the truth behind why management doesn\u2032t work and what to do about it. Unearthing the arbitrary origins of commonly held doctrines such as the omniscience of leader (Emperor) and the most widely embraced myth of all\u64e8e E-Myth Manager offers a fresh, provocative alternative to management as we know it. It explores why every manager must take charge of his own life, reconcile his own personal vision with that of the organisation, and develop an entrepreneurial mind-set to achieve true success.",

It tells boys and girls about the great American document itself--explaining exactly what the Constitution does, as well as how it affects and protects people today. Kids discover how the Constitution provides for the federal government's three branches--legislative, executive, and judicial. Then they see how it gives all citizens many rights, including the right to vote, to enjoy freedom of speech and the press, to worship--or not worship--according to one's religious beliefs, to disagree openly with government policy, and to defend oneself in courts of law when accused of crimes or civil wrongs. Kids also see how, according to the Constitution, many rights are kept beyond control of the federal government, and are reserved for the separate states, communities, and individuals. This book's language is clear and simple. It cites many examples that relate directly to each student's own experiences.",

Greeley takes them once again to Ireland for another thrill-packed adventure.Back on the Emerald Isle, Nuala and Dermot soon get the feeling that someone is out to get them. They find themselves dodging multiple explosions, and someone starts shooting at Nuala while she is water-skiing in the cold Atlantic. Meanwhile, the handsome parish priest, Father Jack, has given Dermot the diary of a young Chicago newspaperman. Written in the year 1882, the diary tells in horrendous detail an intriguing story of a mass murder and a trumped-up trial in which one of Ireland's greatest heroes was accused of the murders without a shred of evidence. These two stories, ancient and modern, soon get mixed up, and they make for an utterly fascinating tale of murder, betrayal, and redemption with Nuala and her magical powers at the center of it all. Andrew Greeley not only tells us a riveting tale of adventure and derring-do, he gives us a picture of modern-day prosperous Ireland and the engaging and, of course, sometimes villainous people who live there.",

        "Description": "Grant Comes East, the second book in the bestselling series by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen, continues the story of a Confederate victory at Gettysburg. The first book examined the great \"what if\" of American history: Could Lee have won the Battle of Gettysburg? A Confederate victory, however, would not necessarily mean that the Southern cause has gained its final triumph and a lasting peace. It is from this departure point that the story continues in Grant Comes East, as General Robert E. Lee marches on Washington, DC, and launches an assault against one of the largest fortifications in the world.Across 140 years, nearly all historians have agreed that after the defeat of the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, the taking of Washington, DC, would end the war. But was it possible?Lee knows that a frontal assault against such fortifications could devastate his army, but it is a price he fears must be paid for final victory. Beyond a military victory in the field, Lee must also overcome the defiant stand of President Abraham Lincoln, who vows that regardless of the defeat at Gettysburg, his solemn pledge to preserve the Union will be honored. Lincoln will mobilize the garrison of Washington to hold on no matter what the costs.At the same time, Lincoln has appointed General Ulysses S. Grant as commander of all Union forces. Grant, fresh from his triumph at Vicksburg, races east, bringing with him his hardened veterans from Mississippi to confront Lee.What ensues across the next six weeks is a titanic struggle as the surviving Union forces inside the fortifications of Washington fight to hang on, while Grant prepares his counterblow. The defeated Army of the Potomac, staggered by the debacle dealt at Gettysburg, is not yet completely out of the fight, and is slowly reorganizing. Its rogue commander, General Dan Sickles, is thirsting for revenge against Lee, the restoration of the honor of his army, and the fulfillment of his own ambitions, which reach all the way to the White House. All these factors will come together in a climatic struggle spanning the ground from Washington, through Baltimore, to the banks of the Susquehanna River.Once again, Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen create a brilliant story of how the Civil War could have unfolded. In Grant Comes East, they use their years of research and expertise to take readers on an incredible journey.",

        "Title": "In Dark Water (Ballantine Reader's Circle)",
        "Authors": "By Blakeslee, Mermer",
        "Description": "1. The author has stated that ultimately Eudora's story is one of initiation, not victimhood. In what ways do you think Eudora was 'initiated'? As human beings, do you think that extreme, often painful, experiences are necessary for putting us in touch with the deeper, more remote places of our psyche? 2 'He, he doesn't ever yell at me. He just takes care of me. He never talks or asks me things like she used to, but he takes care of me,' Eudora says about her father after she returns from hiding in the woods. How do you interpret this comment? Is this a statement of acceptance or discontent regarding her father's parenting? 3. Why do you think the author included the scene where Eudora and Pepper are caught naked by Pepper's father? In what ways does this scene contribute to the novel? Do we learn more about certain characters through this disturbing situation? 4. When Popsy gives Eudora a cap to wear to school, he says to her, 'Now when you wear this cap, boy, you keep a mind where this bill's headin', hear?' From that time on, Eudora keeps careful track of every direction she takes. What do you think Popsy was trying to say to Eudora? What effect did her constant mental 'logging' of her whereabouts have on her? 5. Why do you think Eudora related so well to Popsy? Do you think Popsy was, in some aspect, a reflection of Eudora? 6. Why do you think Eudora became such a vehement target for Florence's rage after the death of her son? Were you ultimately able to forgive Florence for her abusive treatment of Eudora? Do you believe that Florence was redeemed in the end? Why or why not? 7. Following the gynecological exam at her boarding school, Eudora mentally collapses, going into a near catatonic state. Since Eudora's emotional life is so intricately tied to her physicality, do you think it was this frightening physical intrusion that finally put her over the edge? Or do you think that the breakdown was inevitable and not necessarily provoked by this event? Has an intense physical experience ever led you to an emotional awakening or collapse? 8. When Eudora leaves for boarding school, she takes Beulah's unwashed coffee cup along with her. What symbolic significance does this cup contain? 9. Which character did you most closely identify with? Why? Were there any characters that you had difficulty empathizing with? If so, why? 10. The author has said that it was a great challenge to present Eudora's voice in a way that made room for her child-like immediacy without alienating the reader's desire and ability to see beyond her, 'to guess at a larger truth than Dorrie's telling.' As an adult, what was it like to hear the bulk of a story through the voice of an eleven-year-old child? How did this shape your reading experience? 11. Author Sandra Scofield says that in this novel 'there is a great deal of pain, but there are no villains.' Do you agree with this? Why or why not? 1 2. Eudora is unable to control the smile that emerges during emotionally charged situations. What does the smile convey to you? How do Beulah and Florence interpret the smile? Is either more accurate than the other? What do you think the smile means to Eudora? 1 3. Do you feel that Mary's decision to let Eudora witness the shooting of her horse was appropriate, or was this too violent a scene for a child's eyes? Why or why not? Have you ever had a child express her curiosity about death to you? If so, how did you handle the situation? 1 4. Regarding Florence's mental deterioration, do you think that she was, to some degree, a victim of an inadequate mental health system? Do you think that the author implies this in any way? How might her condition have been handled differently today? 1 5. Why do you think Four Eyes' snakes held such intrigue for Eudora? Why do you think it was so important to her to touch the snake's yellow ring? 1 6. Eudora had a vivid dream one night in her boarding school about a horse being lifted out of the water by a rope: 'They were going to take him out of the water, lift him up. They were going to save him. I knew that if they lifted him into the air going seven thousand miles an hour, all his bones would snap. I knew and they didn't. I needed to tell them right away.' What was the significance of this dream? Who--or what--do you think the horse represented to Eudora? 1 7. Why do you think Eudora thrives so wonderfully at the Tappens? Aside from their love for her, are there other aspects of her life on the farm that beckon her frightened soul out of hiding? 1 8. In your opinion, what is the driving theme of this novel?",

Believing that America should remain a strong world leader, Clarke and Clad convincingly argue for restraint in foreign policy decisions. Ever since George Bush proclaimed his vision of a \"new world order,\" most foreign policy thinking has worked on the premise that we have moved into a new era for which we must invent new rationales and agendas for action. Against this, the authors argue that, in Warren Harding's words, America's need today is not for \"heroics, but healing; not nostrums but normalcy.\"",

        "Description": "In the wake of Sassy and as an alternative to the more staid reporting ofMs., Bitch was launched in the mid-nineties as a Xerox-and-staple zine covering the landscape of popular culture from a feminist perspective. Both unabashed in its love for the guilty pleasures of consumer culture and deeply thoughtful about the way the pop landscape reflects and impacts women's lives, Bitch grew to be a popular, full-scale magazine with a readership that stretched worldwide. Today it stands as a touchstone of hip, young feminist thought, looking with both wit and irreverence at the way pop culture informs feminism--and vice versa--and encouraging readers to think critically about the messages lurking behind our favorite television shows, movies, music, books, blogs, and the like.BITCHFest offers an assortment of the most provocative essays, reporting, rants, and raves from the magazine's first ten years, along with new pieces written especially for the collection. Smart, nuanced, cranky, outrageous, and clear-eyed, the anthology covers everything from a 1996 celebration of pre-scandal Martha Stewart to a more recent critical look at the \"gayby boom\"; from a time line of black women on sitcoms to an analysis of fat suits as the new blackface; from an attempt to fashion a feminist vulgarity to a reclamation of female virginity. It's a recent history of feminist pop-culture critique and an arrow toward feminism's future.",

Now he delivers the page-turner of the season, an unforgettable journey to the heart of darkness and to the pinnacle of grace, at once chilling and wickedly funny, a brilliantly observed chronicle of good and evil in our time, of illusion and everlasting truth. He\u2019s Hollywood\u2019s most dazzling star, whose flawless countenance inspires the worship of  millions and fires the hatred of one twisted soul.

Here a magnificent mansion is presided over by a Scottish force of nature known as Mrs. McBee, before whom all men tremble. A mad French chef concocts feasts for the mighty and the malicious.

But there\u2019s definitely nothing nice about the brutal tableau behind the yellow crime-scene tape. On a lonely lover\u2019s lane in the hills of Los Angeles, a young couple lies murdered in a car. Each bears a single gunshot wound to the head. The female victim has also been impaled by a metal spike. And that savage stroke of psychopathic fury tells Milo this case will call for more than standard police procedure. As he explains to Delaware, \u201cNow we\u2019re veering into your territory.\u201dIt is dark territory, indeed. The dead woman remains unidentified and seemingly unknown to everyone. But her companion has a name: Gavin Quick\u2014and his troubled past eventually landed him on a therapist\u2019s couch. It\u2019s there, on familiar turf, that Delaware hopes to find vital clues. And that means going head-to-head with Dr. Mary Lou Koppel, a popular celebrity psychologist who fiercely guards the privacy of her clients . . . dead or alive. But when there\u2019s another gruesomely familiar murder, Delaware surmises that his investigation has struck a nerve. As he trolls the twisted wreckage of Quick\u2019s tormented last days, what he finds isn\u2019t madness, but the cold-blooded method behind it. And as he follows a chain of greed, corruption, and betrayal snaking hideously through the profession he thought he knew, he\u2019ll discover territory where even he never dreamed of treading.As provocative as it is suspenseful, Therapy is premier Kellerman that finds the award-winning author firing on all creative cylinders\u2014and carrying readers on an electrifying ride to a place only he can take them, for an experience they won\u2019t soon forget.",
