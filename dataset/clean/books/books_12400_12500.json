Here they come face to face with the aging southern preacher whose life has been saved by the gift of their daughter's heart. The wholly different ways this thoughtful scientific couple respond to this macabre encounter - Nan, in denial, retreating to the safety of the past; Douglas, in the here and now, emotionally distraught at the idea that part of his daughter lives on in this frail man - force Nan to recognize the perilous gulf between them.Seeking escape, Nan flees to the shell-strewn beaches of Sanibel Island, while Douglas waits out a bitter New York winter seeking the warmth of someone new. But it takes another life-threatening event to allow them to step out of their own footprints and let the healing - both for them and for their surviving son - begin.",

Through the tireless work and unbounded optimism of a few wealthy dreamers and a few million immigrant workers, this rocky, swampy islet at the mouth of the Hudson River was transformed into today's axis of world capitalism\u2014a dazzling metropolis of soaring skyscrapers and great city parks, magnificent museums and professional sports teams, epicurean restaurants and intricate subway systems.Eminent photographer Carol M. Highsmith has captured the essence of Manhattan in a stunning new collection of over one hundred city portraits, ranging from breathtaking panoramas of the celebrated skyline to close-ups of architectural details.  Her camera sweeps across the city, pausing at the magnificent stainless-steel Art Deco Chrysler Building, the twin towers of the World Trade Center, Rockefeller Center, and other architectural landmarks, then traversing Manhattan's eclectic neighborhoods to discover the heartbeat of this urban wonderland. Ted Landphair's compelling account of the history of Manhattan, illustrated throughout with historical photographs, provides the perfect complement to Highsmith's contemporary photography.  The crisp, lively introduction and captions reveal little-known facts and anecdotes about the city.Manhattan: A Photographic Tour  captures the island of Manhattan in all its cocky vigor, beauty, and trendsetting sophistication.  It is the perfect souvenir of a memorable visit, and the ideal gift for anyone who savors unforgettable architecture, unsurpassed culture, and fascinating diversity.",

Kreizler and his friends - high-living crime reporter John Schuyler Moore; indomitable, derringer-toting Sara Howard; the brilliant (and bickering) detective brothers Marcus and Lucius Isaacson; powerful and compassionate Cyrus Montrose; and Stevie Taggert, the boy Kreizler saved from a life of street crime - have returned to their former pursuits and tried to forget the horror of the Beecham case. But when the distraught wife of a Spanish diplomat begs Sara's aid, the team reunites to help find her kidnapped infant daughter. It is a case fraught with danger, since Spain and the United States are on the verge of war. Their investigation leads the team to a shocking suspect: a woman who appears to the world to be a heroic nurse and a loving mother, but who may in reality be a ruthless murderer of children.",

        "Description": "What America looks like to the rest of the worldAmericans rarely used to think about the outside world. As the mightiest nation in history, the United States could do as it pleased. Now Americans have learned the hard way that what outsiders think matters. When terror struck last September 11, author Mark Hertsgaard was completing a trip around the world, gathering perceptions about America from people in fifteen countries. Whether sophisticated business leaders, starry-eyed teenagers, or Islamic fundamentalists, his subjects felt both admiring and uneasy about the United States, enchanted yet bewildered, appalled yet envious.This complex catalogue of impressions--good, bad, but never indifferent--is the departure point for a short, pointed essay in the tradition of Common Sense and The Fate of the Earth. How can the world's most open society be so proud of its founding ideals yet so inconsistent in applying them? So loved for its pop culture but so resented for its high-handedness? Exploring such paradoxes, Hertsgaard exposes uplifting and uncomfortable truths that force natives and outsiders alike to see America with fresh eyes.\"Like it or not, America is the future,\" a European tells Hertsgaard. In a world growing more American by the day, The Eagle's Shadow is a major statement about and to the place everyone discusses but few understand.",

        "Description": "The basis for the movie of the same name, an astonishing tale of one lock of hair and its amazing travels--from nineteenth-century Vienna to twenty-first-century America.When Ludwig van Beethoven lay dying in 1827, a young musician named Ferdinand Hiller came to pay his respects to the great composer, snipping a lock of Beethoven's hair as a keepsake--as was custom at the time--in the process. For a century, the lock of hair was a treasured Hiller family relic, until it somehow found its way to the town of Gilleleje, in Nazi-occupied Denmark. There, it was given to a local doctor, Kay Fremming, who was deeply involved in the effort to help save hundreds of hunted and frightened Jews.After Fremming's death, his daughter assumed ownership of the lock, and eventually consigned it for sale at Sotheby's, where two American Beethoven enthusiasts, Ira Brilliant and Che Guevara, purchased it in 1994. Subsequently, they and others instituted a series of complex forensic tests in the hope of finding the probable causes of the composer's chronically bad health, his deafness, and the final demise that Ferdinand Hiller had witnessed all those years ago. The results, revealed for the first time here, are the most compelling explanation yet offered for why one of the foremost musicians the world has ever known was forced to spend much of his life in silence.In Beethoven's Hair, Russell Martin has created a rich historical treasure hunt, a tale of false leads, amazing breakthroughs, and incredible revelations. This unique and fascinating book is a moving testament to the power of music, the lure of relics, the heroism of the Resistance movement, and the brilliance of molecular science.",

Bush, a self-proclaimed straight-talking Texan, has been roundly lampooned for his weak grasp of the English language: \"subliminable,\" \"resignate,\" and transformationed\" being only a few of his malapropisms. As ridiculous as Bush sometimes sounds, we shouldn't underestimate him or the right-wingers who put him in power, because they never say what they mean or mean what they say.Over the past few decades, the radical right has engaged in a well-funded, self-conscious program of Orwellian doublespeak, transforming American political discourse to suit their political ends. \"Private accounts\" became \"personal accounts.\" \"Massachusetts liberal\" was used to slur John Kerry's record. And their \"compassionate conservative\" tax cuts were neither conservative nor compassionate, unless you happen to be a Republican fat cat.Sick and tired of their sinister deceptions, celebrated Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel set out to explode their verbal gymnastics by asking her readers to suggest satirical definitions of Republican jargon. The result was a grassroots groundswell of hilarious submissions from Americans who are mad as hell and aren't going to take it any more.

Melissa Boyle Mahle, a sixteen-year covert operative for the CIA in the Middle East, was the Agency\u2019s top-ranked female Arabist before she left in 2002. In Denial and Deception, Mahle not only describes the Agency\u2019s successes and failures, but details her life as a woman in one of the last professions that remain almost exclusively male-directed and dominated.The author has a unique vantage point from which to view the political and operational culture of the CIA in the post-Cold War climate, and reveals how it failed to anticipate the 9/11 attacks. From Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush, she provides a vivid narrative of how the agency became a rudderless organization, lost in the post-Cold War world. Afraid to take risks that might offend Congress and European allies after overstepping its legal bounds in the Iran-Contra era, gutted of the clandestine operators who knew how to run secret wars, demoralized by criticism and poor performance, the CIA simply became unable and unwilling \"to get down and dirty to do the hard part to fight a real war on terrorism.\"",

In \"The Time I Heard the Private Donald J.

In \"Manners of Dying,\" variations of a warden's letter to the mother of a son he has just executed reveal how each life is contained in its end. The final story, \"The Mirror Machine\", is about a young man who discovers an antique mirror-making machine in his grandmother's attic. The man's fascination with the object is juxtaposed with the longwinded reminiscences it evokes from his grandmother.Written earlier in Martel's career, these tales are as moving as they are thought-provoking, as inventive in form as they are timeless in content. They display that startling mix of dazzle and depth that have made Yann Martel an international phenomenon.",

Under his deft guidance, we can begin to grasp the fundamental riddle of today's quantum mechanics: how a single photon can be seen going in two directions at once. Along the way, Gribbin reveals some fascinating discoveries: how quantum particles could one day be used in a Star Trek-type teleportation system, and how quantum cryptographers have developed ways of making unbreakable codes using quantum effects. Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality illuminates the world's most intriguing and enigmatic scientific phenomenon - and shows how the \"impossible dreams\" of such legendary scientists as Bohr, Feynman, and Einstein may soon become reality.",

Each of us will face some loss, sorrow and disappointment in our lives, and The Courage to Grieve provides the specific help we need to enable us to face our grief fully and to recover and grow from the experience. Although the book emphasizes the response to the death of a loved one, The Courage to Grieve can help with every kind of loss and grief.Judy Tatelbaum gives us a fresh look at understanding grief, showing us that grief is a natural, inevitable human experience, including all the unexpected, intense and uncomfortable emotions like sorrow, guilt, loneliness, resentment, confusion, or even the temporary loss of the will to live. The emphasis is to clarify and offer help, and the tone is spiritual, optimistic, creative and easy to understand. Judy Tatelbaum provides excellent advice on how to help oneself and others get through the immediate experience of death and the grief that follows, as well as how to understand the special grief of children. Particularly useful are the techniques for completing or \"finishing\" grief--counteracting the popular misconception that grief never ends. The Courage to Grieve shows us how to live life with the ultimate courage: not fearing death. This book is about so much more than death and grieving it is about life and joy and growth.",

        "Title": "Piltdown: A Scientific Forgery",
        "Authors": "By Spencer, Frank",
        "Description": "On the night of December 18, 1912, a packed meeting of the Geological Society of London listened to Charles Dawson, a rural lawyer and an amateur geologist, make an exciting announcement: he had found evolution's missing link in an old gravel pit near Piltdown Common.  Together with Arthur Smith Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the British Museum and a noted authority on prehistoric archaeology, Dawson had discovered the shattered remnants of a thick, human-like skull together with a simian jaw--the fossils of a strange creature halfway between apes and human beings.  Though debates raged over reconstructing Piltdown Man from these remains, few doubted their authenticity--and it was not until forty years later that further tests proved they were an elaborate fake.     Written by anthropologist Frank Spencer, Piltdown tells the story of this incredible hoax, the greatest forgery in the history of modern science.  Spencer begins by taking us back to the debates in Edwardian Britain over the antiquity of Homo sapiens and the public excitement over the search for the missing link between apes and human beings.  He recounts Dawson's initial \"discovery\" of the shattered skull, the further dramatic finds made with Woodward in the midst of the furious scientific debate over Piltdown Man, and the great public argument between Woodward and Arthur Keith over the reconstruction of the head (Keith, an anatomist and Conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, won fame by promoting his own theory of a very human-like version of the Piltdown skull). Spencer also traces the increasing confusion and doubt over Piltdown Man as later archaeological discoveries were made in Africa and China: the Piltdown Man didn't seem to fit the emerging picture of human evolution, and an ever-larger number of scientists claimed that the jaw did not belong with the skull.  Finally, he captures the dramatic uncovering of the hoax, closely following anthropologist Joseph Weiner's fascinating investigation in 1953.  Weiner--troubled by the inconsistencies of Piltdown Man--revealed that the remains consisted of a modern human skull and the jaw of an orangutan, treated with chemicals to simulate great age and planted at the Piltdown site.     Yet the question of who perpetrated the forgery has remained to the present day. Certainly Dawson, a rural solicitor who craved a great scientific reputation, was intimately involved.  But who provided the tremendous expertise behind the hoax, and why would such a learned authority risk his career on a highly public fake?  Was it Woodward, the great archaeologist most closely associated with the find?  Keith, the prominent anatomist?  Or was it Teilhard de Chardin, the French priest who found a critical tooth at the site?  Spencer draws on original documents from the archives of the British Museum and other sources to identify the missing conspirator, in a startling and convincing revelation.  Compelling and authoritative, Piltdown offers a gripping account of this great hoax and the final word on one of the deepest mysteries of modern science.",

Player salaries are out of sight. Television revenues are about to plummet. Several clubs are up for sale. Others claim they have great difficulty in making their team payroll. Newspaper columnists everywhere complain that the games run too long and that the World Series games start too late for the next generation of baseball fans to watch them.Baseball insiders argue that the talent pool at the major league level is extremely thin - and now, two new expansion teams come into existence in the spring of 1993. Poll after poll shows that not only has the National Football League long passed baseball as America's favorite, but that the National Basketball Association has already bypassed major league baseball as well. And of course, since the owners forced Fay Vincent to quit, there hasn't been a commissioner to grapple with all these knotty problems.And so the sport of baseball rumbles on, without any real direction nor any long-range plan to deal with its pressing concerns. Indeed, the future of what was once a leisurely pastime hangs in the balance.Like an old ball that has been smacked around once too often, major league baseball is quickly coming apart at the seams.",

Every girl\u2019s dream, right? But then Tim declared that the wedding was off\u2013leaving Liv shell-shocked. Luckily, she\u2019s got her best friend\u2019s fab Australian beach house in which to recuperate. The restorative powers of the Sydney sun, sand, and sea soon have Liv feeling wonderfully careless, wanton, and reckless. Things really couldn\u2019t get any more anti-accountant when she runs into old flame Ben Parker. It\u2019s been years since they fooled around on their summer vacation, but Liv never forgot that genetically-blessed face. Raring to help her land beautiful Ben, Liv\u2019s friends teach her the Rules of Dog Handling: Treat a man like a dog, and he\u2019ll be eating out of your hand. But surely this can\u2019t actually work? Liv is about to find out that it can\u2013but she\u2019s hardly prepared for the unexpected results.",

        "Title": "The Young Musician's Survival Guide: Tips from Teens & Pros",
        "Authors": "By Nathan, Amy",
        "Description": "Learning to play a musical instrument can be fun, but also quite a burden at times. Young people not only have to find time to practice in the midst of their super-busy schedules. They also have to deal with such tricky problems as taming performance jitters, handling pesky peers, mastering challenging pieces, preparing for rigorous competitions, and dealing with demanding conductors. This lively, highly accessible book will help young people with some of the difficulties involved in learning a new instrument. It is filled with practical tips from more experienced teens and from well-known professional musicians. Numerous studies have demonstrated that children relate much better to advice from an age group closer to their own. That is why 150 teens from renowned musical programs, such as the Juilliard School's Pre-College Program and Boston University's Tanglewood Institute--offer pointers on coping with the various problems they encountered at an earlier age. Both youngsters and adults will also benefit from the practical advice given by nineteen professional musicians, including Wynton Marsalis, Paula Robison, James Galway, Andre Watts, Joshua Bell, and Evelyn Glennie. They tell us how they tackled these same problems when they were kids, and how they handle them today. An extensive resource guide at the end of the book, complete with web address listings, both directs readers to sources of additional help and helps them in their exploration of the world of music. If you are the parent of a child with musical ability, or if your son or daughter is trying to master a musical instrument, this book is the kind of gift that will save a lot of headaches for both you and your youngsters.",

        "Authors": "By Elgin, Duane",
        "Description": "When Voluntary Simplicity was first published in 1981, it quickly became recognized as a powerful and visionary work in the emerging dialogue over sustainable ways of living.  Now, more than ten years later and with many of the planet's environmental stresses having become more urgent than ever, Duane Elgin has revised and updated his revolutionary book.Voluntary Simplicity is not a book about living in poverty; it is a book about living with balance.  It illuminates the pattern of changes that an increasing number of Americans are making in their everyday lives -- adjustments in day-to-day living that are an active, positive response to the complex dilemmas of our time.  By embracing, either partially or totally, the tenets of voluntary simplicity -- frugal consumption, ecological awareness, and personal growth -- people can change their lives.  And in the process, they have the power to change the world. First published in 1981, Voluntary Simplicity was instantly recognized as a visionary work.  The New York Times called it \"seminal\"; the Wall Street Journal noted that it was \"considered the movement's Bible.\" Revised in 1993 to address the trend toward downshifting, this pertinent book helps us to adjust our thoughts, habits, and goals and embrace the key elements of simplicity: frugal consumption, ecological awareness and personal growth.",

        "Title": "The Defeat of Imperial Germany, 1917-1918 (Major Battles and Campaigns)",
        "Authors": "By Paschall, Rod",
        "Description": "The Defeat of Imperial Germany, 1917-1918 by Rod Paschall is the first volume in the Major Battles and Campaigns series under the general editorship of John S. D. Eisenhower. Designed for the \"armchair strategist,\" this book offers striking proof of the inaccuracy of the conventional depiction of the trench warfare of the First World War, in which commanding generals are seen as mediocre and unimaginative, having stubbornly sent hundreds of thousands of troops over the top to be mowed down by the lethal weaponry of modern war. Paschall builds a compelling case that the generals on both sides invented ingenious new strategies that simply failed in the context of a war of attrition. In a series of vivid analyses of successive offenses, Paschall describes the generals' plans, how their plans were aimed at dislodging the entrenched enemy and restoring maneuver and breakthrough on the Western Front, and what happened when the massed soldiery under their command sought to carry out their orders. Though these strategies and tactics largely failed at the time, they would prove successful when implemented twenty years later during World War II. Dozens of photographs, many never before published, as well as theater and battlefield maps help make The Defeat of Imperial Germany, 1917-1918 an outstanding and original contribution to the body of knowledge of the Great War.",

From era-defining scandals such as Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Enron to coldhearted policies on health care, welfare, and race, to their outrageous theft of the 2000 election and tearing down of the liberal democratic ideals for which the Founding Fathers fought, to the isolationist arrogance of George W. Bush, this book has it all. Divided into such easy-reference sections as Greed, Corruption, Malicious Stupidity, and Big Lies, this collection includes appropriate excerpts from the likes of Eric Schlosser, Michael Moore, Joan Didion, Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose, and David Brock, as well as Ralph Nader, Paul Krugman, Hunter S.
