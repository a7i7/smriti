The Vaeths give up the comforts of suburban retirement and criss-cross the United States with their baby granddaughter, Rita, in tow. They start a new life along America's backroads, at once assuaging their own grief, as well as trying to protect Rita from knowing the truth about her father. But no matter how far they travel, his presence is never that far behind. Through the peaks and valleys of the American landscape, this family must come to terms with itself, and its own redemption.

Evoking a child\u2019s struggle to triumph over fear and despair, it explores the complex issues of race and class in the \"fading light\" of Baltimore. This debut novel will strike as powerful a chord with young readers as it has with adults. The protagonist, eleven-year-old Sam Webber, has been called \"Little Sam\" his whole life. But now Big Sam has disappeared, perhaps for good. Without his dad, Little Sam is just plain \"Samuel\"\u2014and lonely. When he and his mom have to move from their comfortable Baltimore home to a rough inner-city neighborhood, he has plenty to be afraid of: the depression that seems to be engulfing his mother, the taunts of a middle-school bully, his own grief, and bouts of nausea and hyperventilation. But when Greely, the janitor at his school, strikes up an unlikely friendship, Sam begins to see his life\u2014like the varied row houses of his new neighborhood\u2014in a gentler light. Will a surer, stronger Sam Webber emerge from the shadows?",

In Hotel of the Saints, Hegi enters the perspectives of lovers and loners, eccentrics and artists, children and parents: a musician tries to protect her daughter from loving a blind man; a seminary student yearns for the certainty of faith that belonged to him as a boy; a woman transcends her embarrassment for her first love, who has tripled in size.  Ursula Hegi's bicultural background enriches these eleven luminous stories that are set in Europe, Mexico, and the United States. Her characters take risks in searching out the unique places where faith thrives for each of them -- a rundown hotel, the currents of Cabo San Lucas, the embrace of an ex-convict. And once again, she surrounds them with her elegant language and exquisite images.",

        "Description": "Upon the recent publication of Fasting, Feasting, critics raved about Anita Desai: \"Desai is more than smart; she's an undeniable genius\" (Washington Post Book World). The Wall Street Journal called Fasting, Feasting \"poignant, penetrating . . . a splendid novel, \" while the Boston Globe celebrated Desai's \"beautiful literary universe.\" Now, in this richly diverse collection, Desai trains her luminous spotlight on private universes, stretching from India to New England, from Cornwall to Mexico. Skillfully navigating the fault lines between social obligation and personal loyalties, the men and women in these nine tales set out on journeys that suddenly go beyond the pale -- or surprisingly lead them back to where they started from. In the mischievous title story, a beloved dog brings nothing but disaster to his obsessed master; in other tales, old friendships and family ties stir up buried feelings, demanding either renewed commitment or escape. And in the final exquisite story, a young woman discovers a new kind of freedom in Delhi's rooftop community.     With her trademark \"perceptiveness, delicacy of language, and sharp wit\" (Salman Rushdie) in full evidence here, Anita Desai once again gloriously confirms that she is \"India's finest writer in English\" (Independent).",

        "Description": "This perceptive volume gives a detailed account of Chinese children at home and at school. Recently, thirteen American experts in child development visited China under the sponsorship of the Committee on Scholarly Communication with the People\u2019s Republic of China (supported by the National Academy of Sciences, the Social Science Research Council, and the American Council of Learned Societies). They observed and interviewed children, teachers, educational administrators, and parents in twenty-eight schools throughout China. William Kessen, chairman of the delegation, has organized the notes and reports into one cohesive account. This comprehensive volume establishes a foundation on which future research about children in contemporary China can be built. The book traces the development of children in the family, in nurseries, in kindergartens, in primary schools, and in middle schools. The authors report their observations on formal curriculum, social and personality development, teaching practices, and on patterns of the child\u2019s interactions with peers and adults. The mosaic that emerges from this book is filled with the kind of detail that only people who are trained in observing children can offer. The contributors are successful in understanding and communicating what it must be like to be a child growing up in the People\u2019s Republic of China.",

When a crime occurs or an injustice is done, what needs to happen? What does justice require?Howard Zehr, known worldwide for his pioneering work in transforming our understandings of justice, here proposes workable Principles and Practices for making restorative justice both possible and useful. First he explores how restorative justice is different from criminal justice. Then, before letting those appealing observations drift out of reach, into theoretical space, Zehr presents Restorative Justice Practices.Zehr undertakes a massive and complex subject and puts it in graspable form, without reducing or trivializing it. This is a handbook, a vehicle for moving our society toward healing and wholeness. This is a sourcebook, a starting point for handling brokenness with hard work and hope. This resource is also suitable for academic classes and workshops, for conferences and trainings.By the author of Changing Lenses; Transcending: Reflections of Crime Victims; and Doing Life: Reflections of Men and Women Serving Life Sentences.",

She rescues him and nurses him back to health-and falls in love.

As Benjamin and his twin sister try to evade the police, they find themselves recalling their dead parentsthe father who lost a leg in Vietnam, the mother who created children's booksand their stories about trust, loss, and betrayal.What is true, what is fake, what does it mean? Eighty years before the theft, these questions haunted Chagall and the enigmatic Yiddish fabulist Der Nister (\"The Hidden One\"), teachers at a school for Jewish orphans. Both the painting and the questions will travel through time to shape the Ziskinds' futures.With astonishing grace and simplicity, Dara Horn interweaves a real art heist, history, biography, theology, and Yiddish literature. Richly satisfying, utterly unique, her novel opens the door to \"the world to come\"not life after death, but the world we create through our actions right now.",

        "Description": "Since its earliest days, The New Yorker has been a tastemaker\u2013literally. As the home of A. J. Liebling, Joseph Wechsberg, and M.F.K. Fisher, who practically invented American food writing, the magazine established a tradition that is carried forward today by irrepressible literary gastronomes, including Calvin Trillin, Bill Buford, Adam Gopnik, Jane Kramer, and Anthony Bourdain. Now, in this indispensable collection, The New Yorker dishes up a feast of delicious writing on food and drink, seasoned with a generous dash of cartoons. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for snacking on humor pieces and cartoons or for savoring classic profiles of great chefs and great eaters, these offerings, from every age of The New Yorker\u2019s fabled eighty-year history, are sure to satisfy every taste. There are memoirs, short stories, tell-alls, and poems\u2013ranging in tone from sweet to sour and in subject from soup to nuts.M.F.K. Fisher pays homage to \u201ccookery witches,\u201d those mysterious cooks who possess \u201can uncanny power over food,\u201d while John McPhee valiantly trails an inveterate forager and is rewarded with stewed persimmons and white-pine-needle tea. There is Roald Dahl\u2019s famous story \u201cTaste,\u201d in which a wine snob\u2019s palate comes in for some unwelcome scrutiny, and Julian Barnes\u2019s ingenious tale of a lifelong gourmand who goes on a very peculiar diet for still more peculiar reasons. Adam Gopnik asks if French cuisine is done for, and Calvin Trillin investigates whether people can actually taste the difference between red wine and white. We journey with Susan Orlean as she distills the essence of Cuba in the story of a single restaurant, and with Judith Thurman as she investigates the arcane practices of Japan\u2019s tofu masters.

        "Title": "Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food",
        "Authors": "By Seinfeld, Jessica",
        "Description": "It has become common knowledge that childhood obesity rates are increasing every year. But the rates continue to rise. And between busy work schedules and the inconvenient truth that kids simply refuse to eat vegetables and other healthy foods, how can average parents ensure their kids are getting the proper nutrition and avoiding bad eating habits? As a mother of three, Jessica Seinfeld can speak for all parents who struggle to feed their kids right and deal nightly with dinnertime fiascos. As she wages a personal war against sugars, packaged foods, and other nutritional saboteurs, she offers appetizing alternatives for parents who find themselves succumbing to the fastest and easiest (and least healthy) choices available to them. Her modus operandi? Her book is filled with traditional recipes that kids love, except they're stealthily packed with veggies hidden in them so kids don't even know! With the help of a nutritionist and a professional chef, Seinfeld has developed a month's worth of meals for kids of all ages that includes, for example, pureed cauliflower in mac and cheese, and kale in spaghetti and meatballs. She also provides revealing and humorous personal anecdotes, tear\u2013out shopping guides to help parents zoom through the supermarket, and tips on how to deal with the kid that \"must have\" the latest sugar bomb cereal. But this book also contains much more than recipes and tips. By solving problems on a practical level for parents, Seinfeld addresses the big picture issues that surround childhood obesity and its long\u2013term (and ruinous) effects on the body. With the help of a prominent nutritionist, her book provides parents with an arsenal of information related to kids' nutrition so parents understand why it's important to throw in a little avocado puree into their quesadillas. She discusses the critical importance of portion size, and the specific elements kids simply must have (as opposed to adults) in order to flourish now and in the future: protein, calcium, vitamins, and Omega 3 and 6 fats. Jessica Seinfeld's book is practical, easy\u2013to\u2013read, and a godsend for any parent that wants their kids to be healthy for a long time to come.",

        "Title": "Xeriscape Gardening: Water Conservation for the American Landscape",
        "Authors": "By Ellefson, Connie Lockhart, Stephens, Thomas L., and Welsh, Douglas F.",
        "Description": "Have you experienced repeated droughts, and either bans on, or stringent scheduling of, landscape watering? Have your water bills gone through the roof during summertime watering? Are you battling a constantly browning lawn? Do you want to have a beautiful, quality landscape?If any of this rings true, then Xeriscape Gardening will be your gardening bible. Endorsed by the National Xeriscape Council, this comprehensive primer thoroughly explains the concept of Xeriscape gardening, or quality water-efficient landscaping. It dispels the common \"zero-scape\" image of Xeriscape gardens, namely seas of gravel surrounding a few cacti, and the belief that water-thriftiness in the garden is an issue only in California and the Southwest. The goal of Xeriscape gardening is a landscape indistinguishable in its beauty from one that is water-greedy.The first part of the book is devoted to the seven Xeriscape principles: planning and design, soil analysis and improvement, practical turf areas, appropriate plant selection (both native and non-native), efficient irrigation, mulching, and maintenance. This part - covering a wide range of topics, from planning wildflower and prairie gardens to methods of harvesting water from nature - gives you the tools you need to either plan a Xeriscape garden from scratch or modify an existing landscape. There are valuable tips throughout from Xeriscape gardeners across the country, and useful lists of such things as vegetables and herbs.The second part of the book consists of extensive region-specific plant lists, divided into Natural Rainfall, Occasional Watering, and Regular Watering categories, invaluable when making plant selections for your Xeriscape garden. In addition, the appendixes include literally hundreds of plants that will make their home almost anywhere in the country, again listed according to water needs. There are also lists of plants for dry shade and the seashore.Xeriscape Gardening is a one-of-a-kind reference on a topic no gardener can afford to ignore.",
