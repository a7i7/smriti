        "Title": "Men of the Bible: A One Year Devotional Study of Men in Scripture",
        "Authors": "By Spangler, Ann and Wolgemuth, Robert D.",
        "Description": "Men of the Bible takes a close-up look at fifty-two men in Scripture\u2014complex flesh-and-blood characters whose strengths and weaknesses often seem strangely similar to our own. Heroes and villains, sinners and prophets, commoners and kings . . . their dramatic life stories provide us with fresh perspective on the unfolding story of redemption.Though our culture differs vastly from theirs, the fundamental issues we face in relation to God and the world remain the same. We still reach for great dreams and selfish ambitions. We wrestle with fear and indecision, struggle with sexual temptation, and experience the ache of loneliness and the devastation of betrayal. And, like many of these men, we long to walk more closely with the God who calls us into an intimate relationship with himself and who enables us to fulfill his purpose for our lives. Men of the Bible offers men and women today a unique devotional experience that combines five elements. Each week becomes a personal retreat focused on the life of a particular man:Monday: His Story\u2014a narrative retelling of the biblical storyTuesday: A Look at the Man\u2014focusing on the heart of the man and how his story connects with your own lifeWednesday: His Legacy in Scripture\u2014a Bible study on principles revealed through the life of the manThursday: His Legacy of Promise\u2014Bible promises that apply to his life and yoursFriday: His Legacy of Prayer\u2014praying in light of his storyDesigned for personal prayer and study or for use in small groups, Men of the Bible will help you make Bible reading a daily habit. Whether you dip into portions or read every page, this book will help you grow in character, wisdom, and obedience as a person after God\u2019s own heart.",

        "Title": "Fundamentals of Mathematics, Vol. 1: Foundations of Mathematics: The Real Number System and Algebra",
        "Authors": "By Behnke, H. (EDT), Bachmann, F. (EDT), Fladt, K. (EDT), and Suss, W. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Fundamentals of Mathematics represents a new kind of mathematical publication. While excellent technical treatises have been written about specialized fields, they provide little help for the nonspecialist; and other books, some of them semipopular in nature, give an overview of mathematics while omitting some necessary details. Fundamentals of Mathematics strikes a unique balance, presenting an irreproachable treatment of specialized fields and at the same time providing a very clear view of their interrelations, a feature of great value to students, instructors, and those who use mathematics in applied and scientific endeavors. Moreover, as noted in a review of the German edition in Mathematical Reviews, the work is \"designed to acquaint [the student] with modern viewpoints and developments. The articles are well illustrated and supplied with references to the literature, both current and 'classical.'\"The outstanding pedagogical quality of this work was made possible only by the unique method by which it was written. There are, in general, two authors for each chapter: one a university researcher, the other a teacher of long experience in the German educational system. (In a few cases, more than two authors have collaborated.) And the whole book has been coordinated in repeated conferences, involving altogether about 150 authors and coordinators.Volume I opens with a section on mathematical foundations. It covers such topics as axiomatization, the concept of an algorithm, proofs, the theory of sets, the theory of relations, Boolean algebra, and antinomies. The closing section, on the real number system and algebra, takes up natural numbers, groups, linear algebra, polynomials, rings and ideals, the theory of numbers, algebraic extensions of a fields, complex numbers and quaternions, lattices, the theory of structure, and Zorn's lemma.Volume II begins with eight chapters on the foundations of geometry, followed by eight others on its analytic treatment. The latter include discussions of affine and Euclidean geometry, algebraic geometry, the Erlanger Program and higher geometry, group theory approaches, differential geometry, convex figures, and aspects of topology.Volume III, on analysis, covers convergence, functions, integral and measure, fundamental concepts of probability theory, alternating differential forms, complex numbers and variables, points at infinity, ordinary and partial differential equations, difference equations and definite integrals, functional analysis, real functions, and analytic number theory. An important concluding chapter examines \"The Changing Structure of Modern Mathematics.\"",

        "Description": "Marcel Desaulniers, the prize-winning, bestselling author of such classics as Death by Chocolate, The Burger Meisters, and Desserts To Die For, continues down the decadent road he has paved with sweets, turning his attention to one of America's favorite temptations: cookies.  With his customary wit and clarity of style, Desaulniers has taken cookies to new heights in this stunning collection of seventy-five easy-to-follow recipes, each of which is captured in full-color splendor. Pared-down preparations, concise instructions, and satisfying results make the chocolate indulgences offered in this book the perfect antidote for anyone who has ever considered baking \"work.\"  No one will be able to withstand the temptation of these chocolate cookie combinations, from the simple and delightful Chocolate Peanut Butter Bengal Cookies or Chocolate Raspberry \"Cookiecupcakes,\" to the intricate and impressive Golden Spider Webs with Wicked Ganache and Raspberry Rapture and Chocolate Balloon Cups with Oven-Roasted Pears. Desaulniers also lets us in on some old family recipes; Hessie Rae's Chocolate Pecan Tart Cookies and Mrs. D's Chocolate Chip Cookies make you wonder what other undivulged secrets he's been saving.  As Desaulniers writes in his introduction, \"Rather than showcasing towering confections like those in Death by Chocolate and Desserts To Die For, this is a collection of chocolate cookies, bars, brownies, nougat, brittle, praline, ice-cream sandwiches, candies, and biscuits that you can hold in your hand and pop in your mouth. O.K., so I went overboard and pulled out the plate in the chapter 'More Than a Mouthful.' But as Mae West said, 'Too much of a good thing is wonderful.'\"",

        "Description": "Ten of today's top consultants explain why and how they left the 9-to-5 grind behind, built new careers, and became the best in their field! Become a Top Consultant How the Experts Do it What does it take to build a successful consulting practice? Ron Tepper asked ten consultants in a diverse range of fields and found the formula to be a winning blend of skills, specialized knowledge, strategy, and technique. Now, Tepper shows you how to build a consulting practice of your own simply by following the examples of these ten experts in engineering, data processing, government, accounting, management, sales, real estate, and law. Become A Top Consultant takes you step by step through writing and submitting superior proposals, marketing your consulting services, setting fees, billing, getting help, even moonlighting. You'll learn the basic concepts, practices, specialized skills and consulting requirements for each different field. Best of all, you'll identify easily with the consultants--you'll meet an accountant and a sales trainer, a civil engineer, a football player-turned-headhunter/personnel accountant, an investment advisor who never finished college, and a former real estate salesman who's now a phenomenally successful attorney. They're all top consultants, from all walks of life--the best in the business. And they all started out where you are today. Become A Top Consultant--it's like having a live panel of consulting experts at your service, eager to help you launch your consulting career.",

        "Title": "The New World of Welfare",
        "Authors": "By Haskins, Ron (EDT) and Blank, Rebecca M. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Congress must reauthorize the sweeping 1996 welfare reform legislation by October 1, 2002. A number of issues that were prominent in the 1995-96 battle over welfare reform are likely to resurface in the debate over reauthorization. Among those issues are the five-year time limit, provisions to reduce out-of-wedlock births, the adequacy of child care funding, problems with Medicaid and food stamp receipt by working families, and work requirements. Funding levels are also certain to be controversial. Fiscal conservatives will try to lower grant spending levels, while states will seek to maintain them and gain additional discretion in the use of funds. Finally, a movement to encourage states to promote marriage among low-income families is already taking shape.The need for reauthorization presents an opportunity to assess what welfare reform has accomplished and what remains to be done.  The New World of Welfare is an attempt to frame the policy debate for reauthorization, and to inform the policy discussion among the states and at the federal level, especially by drawing lessons from research on the effects of welfare reform. In the book, a diverse set of welfare experts&#151;liberal and conservative, academic and nonacademic&#151;engage in rigorous debate on topics ranging from work experience programs, to job availability, to child well-being, to family formation. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on welfare reform, the contributors cover subjects including work and wages, effects of reform on family income and poverty, the politics of conservative welfare reform, sanctions and time limits, financial work incentives for low-wage earners, the use of medicaid and food stamps, welfare-to-work, child support, child care, and welfare reform and immigration.Preparation of the volume was supported by funds from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation.",

        "Description": "\"An important and scholarly work; bringing together much information available heretofore only in scattered sources \u2026 easily readable.\" \u2014 Gerald I. Alexander, F.R.G.S. Cartographer, Map Division, New York Public LibraryEarly map making was characterized by secrecy. Maps were precious documents, drawn by astrologers and travelers, worn out through use or purposely destroyed. Just as men first mapped the earth indirectly, via the sun and stars, so must the history of maps be approached circuitously, through chronicles, astronomy, Strabo and Ptolemy, seamanship, commerce, politics. From the first determination of latitude 2000 years ago through the dramatic unraveling of longitude 1700 years later, the story of maps plots the course of civilization. This book charts the course with a breadth and depth still unsurpassed in a scholarly survey.Lloyd A. Brown's cartographic erudition came through his years as librarian of the Peabody Institute, Baltimore, and as curator of maps at the Clements Library, University of Michigan, where he devised a system for classifying and cataloging some 25,000 old maps. He researched The Story of Maps over four years, seeking out as many pertinent sources as possible for a definitive history and summation of map lore.The Story of Maps follows the peaks and declines of western societies, with marine and topographic knowledge flourishing secretly with the sea powers of Minoan Crete and the Phoenicians, surfacing again with Hipparchus, Eratosthenes, Strabo, and Ptolemy, then waning until the Crusades brought travel and trade back to prominence. The Genoese, Venetians, Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, and English all had their years of hegemony, great navigators and charts, aided by the mapping ideas of Mercator and Edward Wright. The most brilliant minds of the era, including Galileo and Newton, attempted to solve the problem of longitude at sea; the solution came from a Yorkshire clockmaker named John Harrison, who won a 20,000 pound prize for his pains.The Story of Maps celebrates cartography from Strabo to World War II. Eighty-six remarkable illustrations, including early maps, prints and portraits, many unique and seen only in museums, supplement the texts. The exhaustive bibliography matches the text in span and usefulness for those who will undoubtedly be stimulated by this book to read more regarding maps.",

        "Description": "\"One word comes to mind: `indispensable.' To understand the mess we're getting into in Pakistan's lawless tribal areas, there's no better book out there.\"---Robert Baer, former CIA agent and author of See No Evil\"Imtiaz Gul takes the reader into the lion's den---into Pakistan's tribal areas, the meanest, toughest region of the planet. He has a journalist's sharp eye for the personalities and conspiracy theories that are woven through this area. This is the best guide yet to understanding the fascinating, frightening place where Al Qaeda lives today.\"---David Ignatius, author of Body of Lies\"Veteran Pakistani reporter Imtiaz Gul brings his deep knowledge and reporting to bear on one of the world's most opaque and underreported places, Pakistan's tribal areas, the headquarters of Al Qaeda and key elements of the Taliban. Gul delivers a balanced account of the evolving relations that the Pakistani military, government, and public have had with Pakistan's own militant groups. This book could not be more well timed as President Obama faces the most important foreign policy challenge of his presidency from the violent extremists who call this place their home.\"---Peter Bergen, author of Holy war, Inc. and The Osama bin Laden I Know\"Imtiaz Gul has provided an invaluable service, drawing together reporting and research on Pakistan's tribal areas and adding his own firsthand experience. A timely and important work.\"---Jason Burke, author of Al-Qaeda and On the Road to KandabarEight years ago we chased the Taliban from Kabul and forced Al Qaeda to find a new home. One by one the militants crossed the border into Pakistan and settled in its tribal areas, terrorizing or bribing their way to power. This place---Pakistan's lawless frontier---is now the epicenter of global terrorism. It is, in President Obama's words, \"the most dangerous place,\" a hornet's nest of violent extremists, many of whom have turned against their own state.Hugely authoritative and astonishing in its revelations, The Most Dangerous Place tells the gripping story of how Pakistan was set on fire, with suicide bombers, unknown before 2002, now striking at least once a week. It confirms what everyone knows though few will admit: there will be no peace in Afghanistan until the Pakistani Taliban is brought under control. Can it be done? Who are these people and what are their links to Al Qaeda and the ISI, Pakistan's all-powerful intelligence agency?For twenty-five years, Imtiaz Gul has been fearlessly reporting on these groups for local and international media. He knows the key players and has unparalleled access to military and intelligence sources. Based on exclusive interviews with high-ranking intelligence, government, and military officers and extensive firsthand reporting in villages where no American journalist would be safe, The Most Dangerous Place is a gripping and explosive expose of a region that we all fear and need urgently to understand",
