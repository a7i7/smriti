Fraught with opportunities to make mistakes, occasions to feel guilty, and the drive to \"do it yourself.\" The pressure to be self-sufficient is high, but it isn't the life God offers.The way of the world will direct you to try harder and work smarter so that you can take care of yourself and even make yourself successful. But the way of the cross will point toward the place where you stop striving ... stop pushing ... stop every self-initiated effort -- so that you can fall into the boundless, liberating, refreshing grace of God!Just imagine being love-driven instead of self-propelled. Imagine abandoning your life to Jesus instead of trying to save yourself. Can you imagine exchanging your fears for that peace that passes understanding? Being relaxed and free instead of stressed-out and anxious? If you can imagine enjoying God instead of trying to repay him, then you can imagine grace.So go ahead! Jump off the cliff of self-sufficiency. Leap out of legalism. Walk off the pier of guilt and condemnation. That's the only way you'll land in the strong arms of the Father who loves you ... the Father who catches you -- every time -- in the grip of his grace.",

As her best friend, Friar Tuck waited daily for Helen to come home from school and play. He guarded her through the long, scary hours of the dark night. Twice he even saved her life.Now it's Helen's turn. No one can say exactly when Tuck began to go blind. Probably the light began to fail for him long before the alarming day when he raced after some cats and crashed through the screen door, apparently never seeing it. But from that day on, Tuck's trouble--and how to cope with it--becomes the focus of Helen's life. Together they fight the chain that holds him and threatens to break his spirit, until Helen comes up with a solution so new, so daring, there's no way it can fail.",

        "Description": "If you have a teen or pre-teen, you recognize the phenomenon already-perhaps without even knowing it has a name. \"The second family,\" as uncompromisingly described by renowned therapist Dr. Ron Taffel is the immense collective power of the peer group and pop culture-a force so pervasive, it threatens to, and often succeeds in, overwhelming the first family of adults at home and in school. Derived from thousands of interviews with kids and adults, The Second Family uses real-life, sometimes graphic examples to bare the truth about the world of adolescence today and to illuminate the new set of rules by which kids operate. The second family can be scary to adults. While many parents bury their heads, insisting \"not my child,\" Taffel reveals that even \"good\" children:- Chronically lie without a trace of guilt - Have sex at astonishingly early ages- Do drugs and alcohol not to be bad but simply because they are thereYet there are healthy aspects to the second family that often go unrecognized:- A secret moral code of peer support that will surprise you- Boys and girls as best friends- Boys taking care of friends in emotional need- Girls becoming powerful group leaders- A social structure for teens that provides a type of intimacy, support, communication and honesty he or she can't find anywhere else. It is impossible to understand today's teens or preteens without understanding the Second Family. Taffel opens a window into a closed world of frightening dangers and equally uplifting possibilities.",

        "Description": "THE KEY TO DISCIPLINE IS NOT PUNISHMENT, BUT MUTUAL RESPECTAll parents try to do their best--but the best of intentions don't always produce the best results. Dr. Jane Nelsen, an experienced psychologist, educator, and mother, believes that children misbehave when they feel thwarted in their need to belong and in their need for love and attention. An authoritative approach, using phrases like \"Because I said so!\", will only lead to rebellious behavior. Instead, parents need basic principles that bring them and their children closer. They need Positive Discipline.Dr. Nelsen explains that parents who use kindness and firmness to teach life skills will encourage self-respect, self-discipline, cooperation, good behavior, and problem-solving skills in their children. In Positive Discipline, revised and updated for the '90s, she shows all of us, parents and teachers alike, exactly how her practical program works--answering, step-by-step, such important questions as:*What works better than punishment to teach children positive, good behavior?*What mistakes do most parents make \"in the name of love\"?*How can parents turn their mistakes into assets?*How can praise be dangerous?*What are the dangers of trying to be \"Super Mom\"?*How can teachers avoid discipline problems in the classroom?\"It is positive! It works! It saves your sanity! And it is easy to share with others.\"--Julie Pope, Parent Sacramento, CA\"As a parent and psychotherapist, I have found enormous value and practical wisdom in Positive Discipline. It conveys a win/win atmosphere for parents and children. The techniques are so easy to learn and fun to use...Anyone following these concepts will see almost instant results and big smiles on the faces of their children.\"--Katherine Dusay, Psychotherapist San Francisco, CA",

        "Description": "\"The MLM Classic.\"--Richard Poe, author of Wave 3Network marketing is a burgeoning field, and it can be a frustrating and difficult experience. There are many who have achieved minimal success, and many more who have made no money at all. With these discouraging figures, how can one become a member of the successful elite? Millions agree that the best way to do this is to spend some time with The Greatest Networker in the World. John Milton Fogg\u2019s extended parable is the story of a young man on the verge of quitting the multilevel marketing business. As he prepares to give his final opportunity meeting, he meets the individual everyone refers to as The Greatest Networker in the World. This warm and wise man takes in his young counterpart and shows him the trade secrets so he too can become a successful network marketer. The young man soon learns that the trade secrets have very little to do with conventional marketing techniques. In fact, he has to unlearn everything he thought he knew about business. \"The paradigm of network marketing is so fundamentally different and distinct from all other paradigms of business, that it requires a pretty complete shift from the way we normally view business to appreciate and understand it.\" The new paradigm is built around one\u2019s habits of thought and discovering that the secrets to network marketing success are within oneself. The values of responsibility, team building, and caring for one\u2019s downline play a much more important role than competitive promotion and advertising. A critical skill for all marketers is the ability to teach people to teach others. Once one has mastered the new paradigm of multilevel marketing, he needs to not only show his downline how to master it, but also how to teach those techniques to others. This leads to greater leadership within the organization, more stability, improved productivity, and as a result, long-lasting success.",

After five years of extensive research involving thousands of people who have pets and work with animals, Dr. Sheldrake proves conclusively what many pet owners already know: there is a strong connection between humans and animals that defies present-day scientific understanding.

Alex Haley's legacy has had as great an impact on American families as any story in the twentieth century.Now, from the author of Roots, comes Alex Haley's Queen - the saga of his father's family.Lovers of sweeping generational epics will find much to rejoice in here. Once again, this is a personal saga, but one played out against the broad canvas of American history. The story begins in Ireland, where Haley's white great-great-grandfather, James Jackson, Sr., is born. From there we travel with Jackson to Nashville, where he meets Andrew Jackson, the future president of the United States. The two men become business partners, and James Jackson makes his fortune. He establishes his grand plantation, The Forks of Cypress, in Alabama, while Andrew ascends to the White House, and the rumblings that will explode into the Civil War gather force.James's son Jass Jackson inherits the plantation just as the genteel, well-ordered antebellum world begins to crumble. His adolescent attraction to the beautiful and strongwilled slave named Easter blossoms into a powerful and lasting love, and from their passionate union comes Queen - the heroine of the tale, Alex Haley's grandmother.This is history at its most compelling - from the Irish sod to the settlement of the South; from the Trail of Tears to the battlefield at Manassas; from the agonies of slavery to the tribulations of freedom - all rendered with the eye for telling detail and the sense of historical significance that readers have come to expect of Haley. In this, his final book, Alex Haley has created a truly multicultural family saga, the capstone to one of the great, classic American stories.The television miniseries of Alex Haley's Queen electrified and engrossed a nation. But that was only part of the picture; here now is the whole story, fleshed out in all its vivid detail and human drama - the journey of an American family as only Alex Haley could tell it.",
