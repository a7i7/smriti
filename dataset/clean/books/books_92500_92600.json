        "Title": "Long Time Leaving: Dispatches from Up South",
        "Authors": "By Blount, Roy, Jr.",
        "Description": "In this acerbic, eminently quotable book, humorist Roy Blount Jr. focuses on his own dueling loyalties across the great American divide. Scholarly, raunchy, biting, and affable, Blount takes on topics ranging from chicken fingers and yellow dog Democrats to Elvis\u2019s toes while sharing some experiences of his own: chatting with Ray Charles, meeting an Okefenokee alligator, imagining Faulkner\u2019s tennis game, and being swept up, sort of, in the filming of Nashville. His yarns, analyses, and flights of fancy transcend all standard shades of Red, Blue, and in between.Blount\u2019s sidesplitting, irreverent musings may not end our tacit Civil War at long last, but they do clarify, or aptly complicate, divisive delusions on both sides of the long-standing national rift. Long Time Leaving is a comic ode to American variety and a droll assault on complacency both North and South from one of the most definitive and esteemed humorists of our time.",

        "Description": "A ball can start a revolution. Born in Kabul, Awista Ayub escaped with her family to Connecticut in 1981, when she was two years old, but her connection to her heritage remained strong. An athlete her whole life, she was inspired to start the Afghan Youth Sports Exchange after September 11, 2001, as a way of uniting girls of Afghanistan and giving them hope for their future. She chose soccer because little more than a ball and a field is needed to play; however, the courage it would take for girls in Afghanistan to do this would have to be tremendous--and the social change it could bring about by making a loud and clear statement for Afghan women was enough to convince Awista that it was possible, and even necessary. Under Taliban rule, girls in Afghanistan couldn't play outside of their homes, let alone participate in a sport on a team. So, Awista brought eight girls from Afghanistan to the United States for a soccer clinic, in the hope of not only teaching them the sport, but also instilling confidence and a belief in their self-worth. They returned to Afghanistan and spread their interest in playing soccer; when Awista traveled there to host another clinic, hundreds of girls turned out to participate--and the numbers of players and teams keep growing. What began with eight young women has now exploded into something of a phenomenon. Fifteen teams now compete in the Afghanistan Football Federation, with hundreds of girls participating. Against all odds and fear, these girls decided to come together and play a sport that has reintroduced the very traits that decades of war had cruelly stripped away from them--confidence and self-worth. In However Tall the Mountain, Awista tells both her own story and the deeply moving stories of the eight original girls, describing their daily lives back in Afghanistan, and how they found strength in each other, in teamwork, and in themselves--taking impossible risks to obtain freedoms we take for granted. This is a story about hope, about what home is, and in the end, about determination. As the Afghan proverb says, However tall the mountain, there's always a road.",

        "Description": "Politics in America today is more than just a contest between left and right, liberal and conservative, argues Steven Malanga in The New New Left. The old labels no longer accurately describe how politics works today, especially in America's urban areas. Instead there's an emerging new political dynamic: the contest between those who benefit from an ever-expanding public sector and those who pay for this bigger government - in other words, between tax consumers and taxpayers.In sharp vignettes, Mr. Malanga traces the rise of the tax consumers' movement to two sources. One is the growth of public-sector employee unions beginning in the 1950s, which produced an increasingly powerful and influential lineup of organizations that are essentially political. The second is the War on Poverty of the 1960s, whose funding of grassroots social service groups created a new type of neighborhood \"political club,\" sustained by and organized around public funding.",

        "Authors": "By Benkovic, Johnnette S.",
        "Description": "We must be women who are spiritual mothers, women who are full of grace, women of the abundant life. &#151;from Chapter Eight  What happens when women give their lives over to God? They become vessels of grace, bearers of healing, consolation, encouragement and strength to a troubled world. Far from being passive, the woman of grace will actively embrace God's will, actively seek out the suffering and lost, and actively bring God's healing love to others. If she accepts God's call to authentic womanhood, her role, in the words of a closing speech at Vatican Council II, becomes nothing less than to \"aid humanity in not falling.\" Full of Grace will empower all women to fully embrace their God-given identity. This edition of Full of Grace is now correlated to The Women of Grace\u00ae Foundational Study Series.  A Servant Book.  \"A beautiful woman-to-woman book on the way to holiness for Catholic women. A book for all ages.\"&#151;Ronda De Sola Chervin, Ph.D., author and speaker  \"Johnnette Benkovic masterfully combines the teachings of Scripture and the Church with a down-to-earth program for the way to holiness, upholding the mission of Christian women in the world today.\"&#151;Father George T.

        "Description": "China's spectacular economic growth over the past two decades has dramatically depleted the country\u2019s natural resources and produced skyrocketing rates of pollution. Environmental degradation in China has also contributed to significant public health problems, mass migration, economic loss, and social unrest. In The River Runs Black, Elizabeth C. Economy examines China\u2019s growing environmental crisis and its implications for the country\u2019s future development.Drawing on historical research, case studies, and interviews with officials, scholars, and activists in China, Economy traces the economic and political roots of China\u2019s environmental challenge and the evolution of the leadership's response. She argues that China\u2019s current approach to environmental protection mirrors the one embraced for economic development: devolving authority to local officials, opening the door to private actors, and inviting participation from the international community, while retaining only weak central control. The result has been a patchwork of environmental protection in which a few wealthy regions with strong leaders and international ties improve their local environments, while most of the country continues to deteriorate, sometimes suffering irrevocable damage. Economy compares China\u2019s response with the experience of other societies and sketches out several possible futures for the country.",

After he was taken in and nursed back to health by the people of an impoverished Pakistani village, Mortenson promised to return one day and build them a school. From that rash, earnest promise grew one of the most incredible humanitarian campaigns of our time-Greg Mortenson's one-man mission to counteract extremism by building schools, especially for girls, throughout the breeding ground of the Taliban.Award-winning journalist David Oliver Relin has collaborated on this spellbinding account of Mortenson's incredible accomplishments in a region where Americans are often feared and hated. In pursuit of his goal, Mortenson has survived kidnapping, fatwas issued by enraged mullahs, repeated death threats, and wrenching separations from his wife and children. But his success speaks for itself. At last count, his Central Asia Institute had built fifty-five schools. Three Cups of Tea is at once an unforgettable adventure and the inspiring true story of how one man really is changing the world-one school at a time.",

They take the sounds of the world and amplify them.\" Josh Swiller recited this speech to himself on the day he arrived in Mununga, a dusty village on the shores of Lake Mweru. Deaf since a young age, Swiller spent his formative years in frustrated limbo on the sidelines of the hearing world, encouraged by his family to use lipreading and the strident approximations of hearing aids to blend in. It didn't work. So he decided to ditch the well-trodden path after college, setting out to find a place so far removed that his deafness would become irrelevant.That place turned out to be Zambia, where Swiller worked as a Peace Corps volunteer for two years. There he would encounter a world where violence, disease, and poverty were the mundane facts of life. But despite the culture shock, Swiller finally commanded attention\u2014everyone always listened carefully to the white man, even if they didn't always follow his instruction. Spending his days working in the health clinic with Augustine Jere, a chubby, world-weary chess aficionado and a steadfast friend, Swiller had finally found, he believed, a place where his deafness didn't interfere, a place he could call home. Until, that is, a nightmarish incident blasted away his newfound convictions.At once a poignant account of friendship through adversity, a hilarious comedy of errors, and a gripping narrative of escalating violence, The Unheard is an unforgettable story from a noteworthy new talent.",

It looks like only a small diversion - a quick trip to the Planet Jagen, to investigate reports of a possible First Sun artifact.   She doesn't have to run an excavation, or even gain possession of the artifact.  Just file a report.  But it smells bad, says Gretchen's Hesht companion, Magdalena.    David Parker,  the Company pilot assigned to Anderssen's analysis team agrees.  And they are so right.Gretchen,  Magdalena, and Parker find themselves in very dangerous territory indeed.   Because, unbeknownst to anyone at the Company, the Imperial M\u00e9xican Priesthood has decided to wage a war on Jagan - a war not of conquest or defense, but a \"flowery war\",  planned and fomented for the purpose of blooding the Emperor's youngest son.   Gretchen and her team are  headed right into the middle of the battle.It may be a War of Flowers, but many people will die, and blood will flow in the streets.",

        "Description": "Kirk Radomski was an average guy with an extraordinary secret. But when he pled guilty to distributing steroids, his world imploded.At fifteen, Radonsky began working at Shea Stadium, where he would stay employed for a decade. His first priority as a batboy, and later as a clubhouse attendant, was to make sure all the players had whatever they wanted or needed - he washed their uniforms, packed up their homes at the end of the season, and kept their secrets both on and off the field. At the end of the 1986 season, he even led the world champions down Broadway in their victory parade.But as Radomski got older, the favors and duties he did for some of the Mets became more serious. He created training routines, answered questions about dietary supplements and nutrition - and showed players how to get around drug testing. Gradually he became the guy players went to for anabolic steroids and human growth hormones. By the time the feds knocked on his door, Radomski was known to every major league team as \"Murdoch\" - and had at least one client on each roster.Threatened by jail time - after being identified to the government by some of the very players he helped - Radomsky cooperated and provided many of the names and dates in the groundbreaking and controversial Mitchell Report. Now, he's ready to share his side of the steroids scandal with the world.",
