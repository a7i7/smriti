        "Title": "Dealing with Darwin: How Great Companies Innovate at Every Phase of Their Evolution",
        "Authors": "By Moore, Geoffrey A.",
        "Description": "Geoffrey Moore is one of the most respected and bestselling names in business books. In his widely quoted Crossing the Chasm, he identified and addressed the greatest challenge facing new ventures. Now he\u2019s back with a book for established businesses that need to learn how to adapt?or suffer the slow declines into marginalized performance that have characterized so many Fortune 500 icons in recent years.       Deregulation, globalization, and e-commerce are exerting unprecedented pressures on company profits. In this new economic ecosystem, companies must dramatically differentiate from their direct competitors?or risk declining performance and eventual extinction. But how do companies choose the right innovation strategy? Or overcome internal inertia that resists the kind of radical commitments needed to truly set the company\u2019s offers apart?       Illustrating his arguments with more than one hundred examples and a full-length case study based on his unprecedented access to Cisco Systems, Moore shows businesses how to meet today\u2019s Darwinian challenges, whether they\u2019re producing commodity products or customized services. For companies whose competitive differentiation to the marketplace is still effective, he demonstrates how innovations in execution can help boost productivity, whether a company is competing in a growth market, a mature market, or even a declining market. For companies in danger of succumbing to competitive pressures, he shows how to overcome inertia by engaging the entire corporate community in an unceasing commitment to innovate and evolve.       For any business competing in today\u2019s eat-or-be-eaten economic jungle, this groundbreaking guide shows not only how to survive, but also thrive.",

For example, what sex essentials should be part of your first-aid kit? What kind of camping equipment provides particular comfort for two? What are the effects of the elements on condoms, spermicides, and other contraceptives? How do you find that perfect spot for your love den? And how about foreplay, personal hygiene, and protection from pesky plants or adverse weather conditions while you're exposed?How to Have Sex in the Woods answers these and other questions for the millions of hikers, backpackers, and campers who know that there's more than one way to commune with nature and that a campfire is good for more than just roasting marshmallows. How to Have Sex in the Woods is full of useful, factual information, covering all the practical how-tos that every amorous camper should know but may have been afraid to ask.

He has a loving and devoted wife, a network of close friends, a comfortable suburban status, an impressive house, a good view from the porch. And most of all, he has a son, for whom he wants only the best. Pete and his wife, Elaine, have only one child, and Pete has pinned his hopes on Alec. They've afforded him every opportunity, bailed him out of close calls with the law, and, despite Alec's lack of interest, even managed to get him accepted by a good college.But Pete never counted on the wild card: Laura, his best friend's daughter. Ten years older than Alec, irresistibly beautiful, with a history so shocking that it's never spoken of, Laura sets her sights on Alec, who falls under her spell. And with that, Pete sees his dreams for his son not just unraveling but completely destroyed. With a belief that he has only the best intentions, he sets out to derail the romance. But he could not have foreseen how, in the process, he might shatter his whole life and devastate his family.",

For example, it shows that at-risk teenagers are consumers who decide whether or not to \"buy\" safe sex practices. This successful approach is based on Alan R. Andreasen's more than twenty years of experience in consulting, teaching, and research with social marketing programs around the world.Andreasen shows that effective social change starts with a thorough understanding of the needs, wants, and perceptions of the target consumer--who has ultimate control over the outcomes. The book offers a detailed explanation of how to design a step-by-step program that will move the customer from ignorance and indifference to action and ultimately maintenance of that action. Marketing Social Change offers a wealth of information for developing an effective social marketing plan.",

        "Description": "The average human brain weighs three pounds\u201480 percent of which is water\u2014and yet it's capable of outstripping the computational and storage capacities of the most complex computer. But how the mind works remains one of humankind's greatest mysteries. With boundless curiosity and enthusiasm, Shannon Moffett, a Stanford medical student, takes us down the halls of neuroscience to the front lines of cutting-edge research and medicine to meet some of today's most extraordinary scientists and thinkers, all grappling with provocative questions: Why do we dream? How does memory work? How do we see? What happens when we think? Each chapter delves into a different aspect of the brain, following the experts as they chart new ground. Moffett takes us to a lab where fMRI scans reveal the multitude of stimuli that our brains unconsciously take in; inside an operating room where a neurosurgeon removes a bullet from a patient's skull; to the lab of Christof Koch, a neuroscientist tracking individual neurons in order to crack the code of consciousness; and to a research lab where scientists are investigating the relationship between dreams and waking life. She also takes us beyond the scientific world\u2014to a Zen monk's zendo, where she explores the effects of meditation on the brain; inside the home of a woman suffering from dissociative identity disorder; to a conference with the philosopher Daniel Dennett, who uses illusions, magic, tricks, and logic to challenge our assumptions about the mind; and to the home of the late Nobel Laureate Francis Crick, co-discoverer with James Watson of DNA's double-helix structure. Filled with fascinating case studies and featuring a timeline that tracks the development of the brain from conception to death, The Three Pound Enigma is a remarkable exploration of what it means to be human.",

But I'm a writer, and when the universe hands you material like this, not writing about it amounts either to waste or a conscious act of evasion.\"So begins award-winning author Christopher Buckley in the most personal and transcendent work of his life, the tragicomic true story of the year in which both of his parents died.In twelve months between 2007 and 2008, Buckley coped with the passing of his dad, William F. Buckley, the father of the modern conservative movement, and his mother, Patricia Taylor Buckley, one of New York's most glamorous and colorful socialites. He was their only child and their relationship was close and complicated. Writes Buckley: \"They were not - with respect to every other set of loving, wonderful parents in the world - your typical mom and dad.\"As Buckley tells the story of their final year together, he takes readers on a surprisingly entertaining tour, capturing the heartbreaking and disorienting feeling of becoming a fifty-five-year-old orphan. Through it all, Buckley maintains his sense of humor by recalling the words of Oscar Wilde: \"To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose both looks like carelessness.\"",

Many congregations have been participating in a renaissance of worship known as the \"liturgical movement\" and have reclaimed worship forms that have served the church for centuries. Yet because the church today is operating in a radically changed cultural environment, many people in our society do not understand liturgical worship and thus we must find language, music, themes, and images that speak to the unchurched, spiritually seeking person. In Beyond the Worship Wars, Thomas G.

When Othello later learns of her innocence, he takes his own life.

Whether on the field or in front of the camera, the Smiling Giant makes everything look easy. But it has taken a lot of motivation, hard work, and help from those around him to get where he is today.  Here, he recounts his extraordinary life to date -- being raised in semirural Virginia alongside his twin brother, Ronde, by a strong single mother who made every sacrifice to make sure her boys had all the tools they needed to succeed in life; getting drafted in 1997 by the Giants, where he eventually became a standout running back after overcoming injuries and flaws in his game with the help of his coaches and teammates; his stellar 2005 season, when he finished the year with 2,390 yards from scrimmage (the second-highest total in NFL history); and the controversies that marred the Giants' 2006 season, including the surprise announcement of his retirement at the age of thirty-one. As much as Tiki takes you into the locker room, past the sidelines, and onto the field to give you the view from inside the huddle, this book is also an inspirational look at his arduous evolution from ordinary player to elite -- on the field and off -- and at the amazing   people along the way who have helped him achieve his goals. Tiki takes on the role of both the interviewer and the interviewee in special \"Tiki Interviews Tiki\" sections, as he asks and answers the really tough questions. Tiki is a riveting, inspiring read for all who want to know what really goes on behind the scenes, and for anyone looking for the strength to step up and follow his or her dreams.",

Lenny G. abandoned Rob\u2019s mother when she was pregnant, leaving behind a tape of his last show as a DJ and a record of the sounds of his native Louisiana. Author Paul Fleischman -- winner of the Newbery Medal for Joyful Noise: Poems for Two Voices and a Newbery Honor for Graven Images -- uses Rob\u2019s memories: his crusty grandfather, his adoring aunts, his mother\u2019s Spanish soap operas, his grandmother\u2019s racy mysteries read aloud, and especially and repeatedly his father\u2019s lone tape to build a counterpoint of past and present, recorded and heard, that is an ever-unfolding, ever fascinating fugue. Determined to find his father, Rob acquires a series of increasingly sophisticated radios, searching obscure stations across the country for that missing voice. This powerful need to find the absent part of his life drives the story forward as Rob both imitates his father in becoming a radio personality and makes a final break in accepting the family he has.",

The \u201chard place\u201d is losing the use of her beloved car, and the \u201crock\u201d is her immovable dad. In order to regain driving privileges, Kim Peterson\u2019s dad talks her into writing an advice column for teens in his newspaper. Kim reluctantly agrees and writes under a pen name. But as she reads letters from peers and friends, she becomes keenly aware of two things: (1) Some kids have it way worse than her, and (2) she doesnot have all the answers! Who can she turn to? Thursday, September 1 I\u2019ve been saving for my own car, but my parents decided that I can only get a car if I keep a clean driving record. That means absolutely NO tickets\u2014period\u2014nada. And the policeman said he\u2019d clocked me going 72 in a 55 mile zone. Oops.When Kim Peterson gets a speeding ticket, her dad offers her a way to retain her driving privileges. If she\u2019ll write the anonymous teen advice column for his newspaper, she can still get a car. So Kim becomes \u201cJamie\u201d of \u201cJust Ask Jamie.\u201d No big deal, she thinks.She answers letters about stuff that\u2019s everyday and stuff that\u2019s not: parents, piercings, dating, drugs, depression, and people who are just users. Nothing Kim can\u2019t handle.But when a classmate is killed, the letters turn to questions about life, death, and what it all means. And Kim starts to wonder if she really does have all the answers\u2014and if not, where to find them. The Christian faith of her adoptive family? The Buddhism of her Korean heritage? Who can she turn to\u2014to just ask? Story Behind the Book\u201cMy teenage years remain vivid in my mind. It was a turbulent time full of sharp contrasts\u2014love and hate, pain and pleasure, trust and doubt. Then, just as I reached my peak of questioning, rebelling, and seeking, I found God. And I found Him in a really big way! My life turned completely around and has, thankfully, never turned back. Hopefully this story will touch and change hearts\u2014speaking to teen girls right where they live, reminding readers that God is alive and well and ready to be intimately involved in their lives right now! \u201d",

        "Title": "My 30 Days Under the Overpass: Not Your Ordinary Devotional",
        "Authors": "By Yankoski, Michael",
        "Description": "Live Life Loud!  You passed that same ol\u2019 bum on the street this morning. You sat next to some smelly girl on the subway last night. You ordered a burger from a worn-out cashier over your lunch hour. What do you think about these people? What does God think about them? My 30 Days Under the Overpass is not a devotional you will read in your quiet time, then carry on with your day. It\u2019s something you\u2019ll actually do\u2014all day, every day\u2014because these thirty days will rock you. Intense reflection on God\u2019s thoughts and feelings toward the poor, broken, and downtrodden will change you\u2026and you will begin to change the world. Not on your next mission trip. Not at church next Sunday. But right here, right now. Ask It.  How do you treat others\u2014those you like, know, don\u2019t know, don\u2019t like? Those who fall into your comfort zone, and those who shove you outside of it?  Read It.  Mike Yankoski and his buddy, Sam, chose to become homeless to discover their answer.  Think It.  Would you go sleep under a bridge in the rain? Would you panhandle for your next meal? Would you help those who do?  Believe It.  \u201cI tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me,\u201d said Jesus (Matthew 25:45).  Live It.  This is not your average devotional. You\u2019ll read it, but you\u2019ll also do it. Get ready for a life change that will change lives.    \u201cMike takes Christ at His word, and challenges you to summon the courage to live the real Christian faith.\u201d  Dean R. Hirsch, President, World Vision International Story Behind the Book\u201cIs God enough to sustain me? Is He trustworthy? Is He worth staking my life on? What happens if I die? Will I even survive? Such questions rang loudly in my mind as Sam and I decided to lay down everything in a full embrace of the homeless life. Some experiences were uncomfortable, some shocking, some disturbing, some hilarious, and still others frustrating. But five months of life on the streets has left us, our faith, and our lives forever changed. We\u2019ve been back from the streets for two years, and now this devotional makes it possible for people to make real-life changes. It contains stories and reflections not included in Under the Overpass .\u201d \u2014Mike Yankoski",
