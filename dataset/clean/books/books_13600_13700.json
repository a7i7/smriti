        "Description": "A quick reference to the planet's driest regions.    Deserts is an abundantly illustrated handbook that examines the fascinating eco-systems of 49 major deserts. Studying the history of deserts improves our understanding of the climatic conditions that create hostile environments. Deserts are located on every continent -- including Antarctica. The book covers each with concise descriptions and quick-reference symbols and charts that display vital statistics such as average rainfall and temperatures, and expanse.    Deserts are defined by their aridity and this lack of water results in conditions that are hostile to flora and fauna, prevent soil, and cause extreme swings of temperature.     For instance, equatorial deserts can experience drops from 122\u00b0F during the day to less than -13\u00b0F at night.    Some deserts are very old -- the            Kalahari has existed for 65-135 million years. Others are relative newcomers -- the Sahara was Africa's Land-o-Lakes until the last Ice Age.     Seven North American deserts are featured: Sonora, Anza Borrego, Death Valley, Gran Desierto de Altar, Mojave, Great Salt Lake, and Great Basin.",

Delia takes off, wearing only her swimsuit and her husband's beach robe, and doesn't stop until she is suddenly captivated by a quiet little tree-lined town. There she halts the van, hops off, finds a stark room to rent, and settles in.So begins her new, impersonal life as Ms. Grinstead. But inevitably the world crowds in. New friends, new responsibilities, accumulate - from a stray cat who craves a home to a sad, deserted husband and his little boy who need her to fill a hole in their lives.",

But they also have something unusual in common: Her name is Erika, the kid sister of a buddy who died, and they promised to look out for her. Five years ago, it seemed a gesture of simple generosity. Now, she's all grown up, and a knockout of a medical student who's arousing some not-so-sisterly feelings in the brothers.When one of them acts on those feelings, they will all - including Erika - discover how far they're willing to go in the name of friendship, loyalty, and love. For seeing Erika in this new light has some disturbing consequences: it gives the guys an eye-opening dose of the double standard they so casually apply to the women in their lives, and the not-so-gentle-manly way they treat their supposedly special ladies. Could their adorable little sister cause such a crisis and be the catalyst for such change? Masculine pride won't admit it, but Erika unexpectedly gives more than she ever got - by making them better men.",

Forensic evidence links her murder with items discovered in Crone's garage. Madriani takes Crone's case, but his defense is hindered by the secrecy surrounding Crone's current research. As the trial unfolds, a scandal from Crone's past, involving his controversial use of genetic racial profiling, is revived. The murdered woman had filed charges of sexual harassment against Crone, and taken secret documents from his files. Paul is left to try to piece together a defense while Crone and his colleagues are hiding parts of the puzzle. When a key witness for the prosecution ends up dead, leaving an incriminating note behind, Crone's acquittal at trial is all but assured.

        "Description": "Good Ted: a devoted father to his own sons and guardian to his brothers' thirteen children; an able legislator who has been described by colleagues as the best senator of his generation.Bad Ted: the world's oldest teenager. As his political star ascended, he was exposed as a relentless womanizer and drinker with no regard for public opinion.Good Ted, Bad Ted puts this paradoxical Kennedy in perspective and answers the question: How can the two Teds coexist in the same individual? Filled with startling new information, this book reveals:John Hinckley, the man who shot President Reagan, initially chose Senator Kennedy as his target. He waited in Kennedy's office reception room for three hours with a loaded .22 caliber Saturday Night Special in his pocket. Had the Senator not been late, he would surely have been the third Kennedy to be assassinated.Nixon was so terrified of facing Kennedy in the 1972 presidential election that he had his two top aides, John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman, set up a team to ferret out any information they could get on Ted. This pre-Watergate plot was financed by $100,000 from CREEP, the Committee to Re-Elect the President. Even Secretary of State Henry Kissinger rushed to Nixon with a \"hot rumor\" that proved wrong.Only three years after Chappaquiddick, Ted was a strong contender for the Democratic nomination for President, leading in the polls by a wide margin and placing fourth in the Gallop Pall as \"the most admired American.\" Readers will now know the real reason why he was not nominated. It was not because of Chappaquiddick.Ted's attempt to dissuade Aristotle Onassis from marrying Jackie Kennedy, fearing that the marriage would harm the Kennedy clan.Ted was roaring drunk at the White House, and so were many New Frontiersmen, the evening after JFK was buried.A year-by-year rundown of Ted's women starting in 1969 and continuing to 1991.The Kennedy money is drying up. Once one of America's great fortunes, larger than the Rockefellers', it is dwindling fast. Now, it barely qualifies for Forbes magazine's Four Hundred. If nothing is done to augment the principal, the fortune will be tapped out soon after the turn of the century.Ted's marriage in 1992 to Victoria Reggie and the very positive influence she has had on his life, both personal and political.",

Describing the many trials and eventual escape to freedom of the long-suffering, good-hearted slave Uncle Tom, it aimed to show how Christian love can overcome any human cruelty. Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin has remained controversial to this day, seen as either a vital milestone in the anti-slavery cause or as a patronising stereotype of African-Americans, yet it played a crucial role in the eventual abolition of slavery and remains one of the most important American novels ever written.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

But when the smoke of the eight-hour battle cleared, only one Marine had lost his life. Some said the 1st Battalion was incredibly lucky. But in the hearts and minds of the Marines who were there, there was no question. God had brought them miraculously through that battle.As the 1st Battalion's chaplain, Lieutenant Carey Cash had the unique privilege of seeing firsthand, from the beginning of the war to the end, how God miraculously delivered, and even transformed, the lives of the men of the 1st Battalion.",

Helped by cutting-edge technology as well as the forensic science he had been teaching for decades, he has made important discoveries. These fascinating revelations are dramatically chronicled in A Voice for the Dead.  Starrs's passionate intention is to set the record straight, to right the wrongs done by tall tales and cover-ups, by even the most cherished historical legends. Among the high-profile cases he writes about are Jesse James-are the remains buried in his purported grave really Jesse's? Mary Sullivan-was she, as supposed, a victim of Albert DeSalvo, who confessed, perhaps falsely, to being the Boston Strangler? And the Cold War government scientist who fell to his death from a high floor of a New York hotel-did he jump or was he pushed?",

The Book of Flight traces the remarkable story of the pioneers, inventors, and daring pilots who turned that dream into a reality. Based on the outstanding collections of the National Air and Space Museum, this handsome book brings to life milestones in flight history: the development of ballooning; the earliest human gliders; the Wright Brothers' first sustained flights; Charles Lindbergh's solo trip across the Atlantic; Amelia Earhart's courageous flights; Chuck Yeager's blast through the sound barrier; the Apollo astronauts' first steps onto the moon; and the building of the International Space Station.    Richly illustrated, this book takes you on an exciting journey through time. You'll watch early inventors at work, thrill to            the first air races and the dogfights of World War I and II, peer inside a flying boat of the 1930s, and witness the horrific explosion of the airship Hindenburg. You'll ride in the DC-3, marvel at the technology of the stealth fighter, and experience life aboard the Space Shuttle. As you turn the pages you'll meet barnstormers and ballonists, stunt flyers and flying aces, and rocket scientists and astronauts.    More than 350 photographs and illustrations portray the development of aviation and space flight. Diagrams explain concepts such as jet propulsion and supersonic flight and depict the workings of rockets and other devices. A comprehensive glossary provides easy-to-understand explanations of technical terms.    The National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, with more than eight million visitors annually, is home to the world's most famous collection of historical aircraft, rockets, and space vehicles.",

Ronald Wilson Reagan, the first actor to be elected president, turned in the performance of a lifetime. But that performance concealed the complexities of the man, baffling most who came in contact with him. Who was the man behind the makeup? Only Lou Cannon, who covered Reagan through his political career, can tell us. The keenest Reagan-watcher of them all, he has been the only author to reveal the nature of a man both shrewd and oblivious. Based on hundreds of interviews with the president, the First Lady, and hundreds of the administration's major figures, President Reagan takes us behind the scenes of the Oval Office. Cannon leads us through all of Reagan's roles, from the affable cowboy to the self-styled family man; from the politician who denounced big government to the president who created the largest peace-time deficit; from the statesman who reviled the Soviet government to the Great Communicator who helped end the cold war.",

What emerges in his sessions with the psychiatrist Balthazar, however, is something far more complex\u2014and unfathomably more sinister\u2014than neurosis. Lawrence Durrell\u2019s kaleidoscopic narrative ushers us into a world in which no perception is reliable\u2014and love itself is always an act of treachery. \u201cDurrell is one of the very best novelists of our time. . . .

A spontaneous, resourceful new beauty that any sensitive reader will almost certainly love.\u201d\u2014The New York Book Review \u201cIt is difficult to sum up Balthazar; it will not be contained.

And, she offers clear guidelines that will sharpen managers' perceptions and help them avoid current and future self-delusions that can kill their companies' and their own chances of success.",

But through it all, David Smith had only one thought: to get his boys back.Nine days later, a tearful Susan Smith confessed that the kidnapping had been a hoax, a cruel lie. The truth would be even crueler: three-year-old Michael and fourteen-month-old Alex Smith were dead, slain by their mother's own hand.David Smith speaks out about his life with Susan, the beloved children he has lost but will always love, and the slow, painful process of trying to put his life back together. He talks honestly and openly about his less-than-perfect marriage - a troubled relationship that led to affairs on both their parts; Susan's destructive obsession with the lover who'd rejected her; the events leading up to that fateful night last October; and, finally, the need to come to terms with his own grief and loss.",

Why can't Sam and Lucy?When Lucy first suggested they make a baby, Sam was gung ho --after all, sleeping with his wife is one of Sam's favorite things to do. Then out came the thermometers, followed by the holistic home remedies -- not to mention some humiliating bouts with specimen jars. Soon Lucy's demands are driving Sam out of his mind. That is, until Sam conceives a plan of his own: He'll write a screenplay based on his and Lucy's poignant (and often uproarious) efforts to conceive a child. It could be a big hit. It might even make Sam's career. Or cost him his marriage . . .From the award-winning author of Popcorn and Blast from the Past comes this hilarious and heartbreaking new novel --a provocative two-sided look at one couple's inconceivable dilemma. From sperm that swim backward to aromatherapy run amok, procreation for Lucy and Sam has turned into a grisly little war. But if Lucy feels barren as the Sahara, and Sam thinks his gay friends will be fathers before he is, they're about to have yet another problem on their hands: saving the love that once was everything they had. . . .",

        "Authors": "By Schlink, Bernhard and Woods, John E.",
        "Description": "1. \u201cGirl with Lizard\u201d \u2022 What gets in the way of the narrator\u2019s emotional life? What is the effect of his parents\u2019 relationship upon his own relationships with women? Is it surprising to learn that his own conception was the result of the rape of his mother by his father? Why is the mother so assiduous in defending the husband she didn\u2019t love or respect? What is the nature of the mother\u2019s moral failure? \u2022 How does the narrator\u2019s obsession with the painting link him irrevocably to his parents, and particularly to the crimes of his father? Toward the end of the story the narrator realizes, \u201cjust as had been the case at home, the painting was a treasure, a mystery, a window onto beauty and freedom, and at the same time a commanding, controlling power to whom sacrifices would have to be made\u201d [p. 51]. Why does he burn the painting? Why does Schlink include the revelation that the painting the boy and his father loved was a fa\u00e7ade, a concealing device? 2. \u201cA Little Fling\u201d \u2022 What is the relationship between the wife\u2019s betrayal of her husband\u2014seducing their good friend\u2014and the husband\u2019s betrayal of his wife\u2014giving information to the Stasi, the East German secret police? Is one betrayal ethically more acceptable than the other? \u2022 Why does Paula make love to the narrator? Despite the upheaval caused by Sven\u2019s ill-judged desire to protect his wife and child, is his marriage still quite stable? To what degree has the narrator been, all along, more naive than either of his friends? How does this story expose the contamination of intimate relationships by the culture of state-sponsored spying? 3. \u201cThe Other Man\u201d \u2022 What was the nature of the relationship between Lisa and Rolf? Why might Lisa have been attracted to him? \u2022 Why is the daughter\u2019s angry evaluation of her father\u2019s habitual self-absorption necessary for the reader\u2019s understanding of his marriage? Is the narrator, newly retired from his work, driven to such lengths in his pursuit of \u201cthe other man\u201d mainly by revenge, jealousy, curiosity, or merely idleness? \u2022 Is Rolf merely a con-man, a showoff, a loser? What are the most striking differences between his character and that of the narrator? Why does the narrator decide not to humiliate Rolf at the dinner party? What does the narrator ultimately learn about Rolf, and about himself? 4. \u201cSugar Peas\u201d \u2022 How does the title, taken from a poem by Heinrich Heine (see p. 162) relate to the story as a whole? How does it relate particularly to the story\u2019s ending, in which the three women each take what they want from Thomas in return for taking care of him? \u2022 We are told, as he successfully balances his relationships with three different women, Thomas \u201cloved the high of a juggler who keeps adding more and more rings to his act\u201d [p. 160]. Thomas is successful in love, in his professional life, in his creative life. To what degree is his strong ego the key to his success in all aspects of his life? Is his self-satisfaction well-founded, or is he merely deluding himself? Which elements make this story so effective as a portrait of a narcissistic man? \u2022 Why does Thomas take on the disguise of a monk? What is the symbolic meaning of the monk\u2019s robe for him? Is there a peculiar sort of justice in Thomas\u2019s accident, his resulting paralysis, and the quiet triumph of the three women? What is comic about the story, and particularly about the ending? 5. \u201cThe Circumcision\u201d \u2022 What is inherent in Uncle Aaron\u2019s question to Andi, \u201cWhat did your father do in the war?\u201d [p. 198] How accurate is Andi\u2019s thought that once Sarah\u2019s Jewish family knows he\u2019s German, \u201call else is irrelevant\u201d [p. 201]? Why is their relationship more difficult for him than it is for her? \u2022 Is it strange that Andi thinks he can be circumcised without religious ritual and without becoming a Jew? What does his circumcision mean to him? Why does Sarah react as she does, and why is Andi so unhappy with her reaction? Why does the story end as it does? Does the story\u2019s ending imply that the division between Sarah and Andi had been irreparable? 6. \u201cThe Son\u201d \u2022 What is the political situation that is the story\u2019s framework? Why is it significant that this is the first time the narrator has ever done anything risky in the course of his career as a professor of international law? \u2022 The narrator is ashamed of the passivity with which he has conducted his life. How is this related to his preoccupation with his son and his grief over his failings as a father? How is the political plot related to the domestic one? Is the ending ironic? Does it seem random? Or fated? 7. \u201cThe Woman at the Gas Station\u201d \u2022 Early in the story, the narrator notes that he worries that his dream of the woman at the gas station \u201cbetrayed something about him\u201d [p. 283]. In what ways might the reader interpret this dream (or fantasy), and what does it betray about the narrator? \u2022 Is the narrator courageous in leaving his wife in the effort to find something that has been missing in his life? What does the story\u2019s ending imply? Are we to assume that he\u2019ll return to the woman at the gas station or not? 8. For discussion of Flights of Love \u2022 In \u201cThe Woman at the Gas Station,\u201d the narrator thinks, \u201cDoesn\u2019t falling in love presume that you don\u2019t know the other person, that he or she still has blank spaces onto which you can project your own desires . . . is there love without projection?\u201d [pp. 289\u201390] Do other stories also express this deep skepticism about the reality of love? Many of these stories revolve around the elemental yearnings of their main characters\u2014yearnings that usually remain unfulfilled. Does Schlink imply that human desire and fulfillment are incompatible? \u2022 All seven of the stories in this collection are written from the male point of view. What does Schlink reveal about the hidden territories of the male psyche? \u2022 Two of the collection\u2019s most powerful stories deal with Jewish questions. If you have read The Reader , how does the legacy of the Nazi past interfere in similar ways with the life of the central character in \u201cGirl with",

She arrives at her home to find she has two neighbors sharing the wilderness -- Red O'Hara, traumatized by horrific wartime experiences working an the Burma railway as a P.O.W. of the Japanese, and Angus McLeod, a retired policeman, who has fled from a society he has as soft and contemptible. Rosie's sudden appearance panics Red and Angus. Both of them fear she will disrupt their neatly ordered lives. And they're right.  Tough, smart, and practical, Rosie soon turn the lives of Red and Angus upside down. And as they work out their relationship, an unexpected threat draws them closer together: the depredations of a big Japanese trawler threaten to destroy their food supply and their environment. As they go to sea in a desperate attempt to prevent the rape of their island paradise, this extraordinary novel of survival and love moves toward a blazing finale reminiscent of another classic: The African Queen.",
