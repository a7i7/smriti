        "Description": "With over 1000 color combinations, this remarkable book assists with color choice in several important ways: it takes the guesswork out of putting colors together by showing in advance what they will look like; innovative color schemes provide new ideas; tint percentages for every color insure correct reproduction. This book is meant primarily as a professional tool for anyone associated with design or the design process. Because of the inclusion of screen values of the four process colors, this book will make perhaps its greatest contribution to those who realize their design through some printed process -- graphic designers, certainly; also environmental designers, advertising and package designers and probably some members of architectural firms who become involved in printed media. In a much broader sense, the book has real value to anyone who needs to confirm color suggestions and examples presented in a straightforward, pure and neutral way.",

The author set about to familiarize Christians with the source of power available to them through prayer.

This is the question at the center of Jonathan Randal\u2019s riveting, timely account of Osama bin Laden\u2019s role in the rise of terrorism in the Middle East.  Randal\u2013a journalist whose experience of the Middle East spans the past forty years\u2013makes clear how Osama\u2019s life epitomizes the fatal collision between twenty-first-century Islam and the West, and he describes the course of Osama\u2019s estrangement from both the West and the Saudi petro-monarchy of which his family is a part. He examines Osama\u2019s terrorist activities before September 11, 2001, and shows us how, after the attack on the World Trade Center, Osama presented the West with something new in the annals of contemporary terrorism: an independently wealthy entrepreneur with a seemingly worldwide following ready to do his bidding. Randal explores the possibility that Osama offered the Saudis his Al-Qaeda forces to drive Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait in 1991; he traces the current sources of Osama\u2019s money; and he tells us why the Iraq war has played into the hands of the terrorists. With his long-maintained sources in the Middle East and his intimate understanding of the region, Randal gives us a clearer explanation than any we have had of the whys and wherefores of the world\u2019s most prominent and feared terrorist.",

Bush)and Ellen Ray (Institute for Media Analysis President), Guant\u00e1namo is the most authoritative documentation to date on President Bush's moves toward a network of detention centers--a system without accountability, which flouts U.S. and international law.With a resource section that includes the Gonzales memo to President Bush and excerpts from the Geneva Conventions, Guant\u00e1namo provides strong evidence of Ratner explains how Gonzales and the Bush Administration are acting to radically alter America's historic commitment to civil and human rights, and why all Americans should resist what is being done in our name.Gathered together for the first time, Guant\u00e1namo: What the World Should Know includes the governmental memoranda that led to the conditions at the Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Abu Ghraib and beyond.Ratner and Ray give the definitive account of what led to the current conditions at Guant\u00e1namo and the importance of continuing to fight against the violations of U.S. and international law undertaken by the United States since 9-11. This book is a must-read for anyone concerned with the rule of law, liberty, democracy--and the right to dissent.Guant\u00e1namo also includes the essay 'A president beyond the law' by Anthony Lewis.",

By making key changes in a dog's diet, exercise regime, environment, and training, Dr. Dodman has been able to work seeming wonders with even the most difficult problems. Treating everything from minor training lapses to blanket-sucking in dachshunds, rage syndrome in springer spaniels, anxiety in Afghans, and obsessive-compulsive disorders in golden retrievers and Labradors, Dr. Dodman tackles the most common as well as the most baffling of dog disorders.He'll introduce you to Rocky, a dominant Rottweiler; Charlie, a fearful mixed-breed biter; Samson and Delilah, a pair of springer spaniels who had to learn to accept their owner's new baby as part of the pack; Tammy, the collie who had a fear of Thursdays; Sybil, a German shepherd terrified of thunder; and last but not least, Elsa, the Labrador who loved too much.Utilizing revolutionary new discoveries in canine behaviorism and pharmacology, Dr. Dodman has given hope and help to owners whose only previous options were obedience schools - and if these failed, which they often do, the painful decision of euthanasia. He also details the use of \"human\" medications to treat specific psychological disorders in our canine companions who, as many a confirmed dog lover will readily agree, are not so different from us humans after all.Complete with special checklists of symptoms identifying specific problems and possible treatment options, Dr. Dodman offers an invaluable resource for the health and well-being of your pet - and your own peace of mind. Whether you own a problem dog or just want to better understand the complex, intelligent mind of your canine companion, this is a book you won't want to miss.",

Bestselling author Steve Berry tackles some of the most controversial ideas of our time in a breakneck journey through the history of the Church and the future of religion.Fatima, Portugal, 1917: The Virgin Mary appears to three peasant children, sharing with them three secrets, two of which are soon revealed to the world. The third secret is sealed away in the Vatican, read only by popes, and not disclosed until the year 2000. When revealed, its quizzical tone and anticlimactic nature leave many faithful wondering if the Church has truly unveiled all of the Virgin Mary\u2019s words\u2013or if a message far more important has been left in the shadows.Vatican City, present day: Papal secretary Father Colin Michener is concerned for the Pope. Night after restless night, Pope Clement XV enters the Vatican\u2019s Riserva, the special archive open only to popes, where the Church\u2019s most clandestine and controversial documents are stored. Though unsure of the details, Michener knows that the Pope\u2019s distress stems from the revelations of Fatima.Equally concerned, but not out of any sense of compassion, is Alberto Cardinal Valendrea, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary of State,. Valendrea desperately covets the papacy, having narrowly lost out to Clement at the last conclave. Now the Pope\u2019s interest in Fatima threatens to uncover a shocking ancient truth that Valendrea has kept to himself for many years.When Pope Clement sends Michener to the Romanian highlands, then to a Bosnian holy site, in search of a priest\u2013possibly one of the last people on Earth who knows Mary\u2019s true message\u2013a perilous set of events unfolds. Michener finds himself embroiled in murder, suspicion, suicide, deceit, and his forbidden passion for a beloved woman. In a desperate search for answers, he travels to Pope Clement\u2019s birthplace in Germany, where he learns that the third secret of Fatima may dictate the very fate of the Church\u2013a fate now lying in Michener\u2019s own hands.From the Hardcover edition.",
