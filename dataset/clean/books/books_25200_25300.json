        "Title": "Great Food Without Fuss: Simple Recipes from the Best Cooks",
        "Authors": "By McCullough, Frances and Witt, Barbara",
        "Description": "Two seasoned food professionals--one a cookbook editor and the other a caterer--match wits here to solve the kitchen dilemme of the '90s: how to serve imaginative, lively food without spending hours fussing or compromising on soul-satisfying flavor. Their solution is just to look to the great cooks--from Julia Child to James Beard to Diana Kennedy--for the simple dishes that are hidden away in even the most complicated cookbooks. They've assembled a treasury of superb recipes that depend on perfectly balanced flavors. The range is broad, from favorite American classics like spoon bread, corn fritters, and the only really delicious oven-fried chicken to exotic new tastes like Moghul Lamb, Bangkok Chicken, and Pasta with Vodka. For each recipe the editors offer tips, variations, suggests, and down-to-earth commentaries about how to work with exciting new ingredients as well as giving their own tried-and-true favorite recipes, simple winners they've cooked for years to great applause. Altogether there are 119 master recipes with 81 variations and 34 Editors' Kitchen recipes, a true culinary gold mine. In their pursuit of the secrets of true flavor, Frances McCullough and Barbara Witt come up with some unusual approaches, rethinking some of our basic ideas about how to prepare roasted chicken and turkey (in a very hot oven), pasta (one method lets it sit in hot water off the flame), and baking potatoes (they're particularly wonderful baked to death). Here you'll find a lot of nitty-gritty information about entertaining, a refresher course on how to make a really good green salad, lists of canapes and tidbit desserts, a collection of quick breads, and microwave notes.In a warm, intimate, encouragingly frank style, McCullough and Witt constantly encourage cooks to improvise by offering a range of variations, to start them experimenting with foods and flavors to develop their own recipes. This is a unique, user-friendly book that works for beginners who are reasonably sophisticated eaters as well as for experienced cooks. It will become the contemporary cook's favorite sourcebook for distinctive food.",

        "Title": "The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing During the Change",
        "Authors": "By Northrup, Christiane",
        "Description": "Dr. Christiane Northrup has become one of American women's most trusted medical advisers. In Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom, she broke entirely new ground by demonstrating that women's most common medical problems are often rooted in the basic conditions of their lives -- and that they can return to health by learning to listen to their bodies. She also integrated advanced medical techniques with the best natural remedies, offering readers specific guidance on choosing the right approach for themselves. Now, in The Wisdom of Menopause, Dr. Northrup once again challenges convention. \"The change\" is not simply a collection of physical problems to be \"fixed\" -- whether with hormones or herbs -- but a mind-body revolution that brings the greatest opportunity for growth since adolescence. This vitally important new book examines the connection between menopause and a woman's emotional and spiritual life. And it stresses how the choices a woman makes now -- from the quality of her relationships to the quality of her diet--either secure her health and well-being for the rest of her life, or put her future at risk.Dr. Northrup draws on her own life-changing experiences -- as well as on many intimate case histories--to explore the transformative power of these years.  Readers will learn: * how menopause literally rewires the brain, triggering a shift of priorities from nesting and caretaking to personal growth and equality * how to listen for the wake-up calls inherent in women's cyclic nature, from PMS to SAD to menopausal symptoms* how the body adjusts naturally to changing hormones, and how to make personalized decisions about HRT and alternative supplements* how to rebalance metabolism shifts and prevent middle-age spread* how to deal with the myths and realities of sexual changes and appearance issues* how to prevent  long-term health problems such as heart disease, hormone-related cancers, and memory lossCandid and reassuring, The Wisdom of Menopause elucidates the changes women should expect from ages 40 to 55, and shows how these changes can be wonderfully life-affirming. Instead of dreading menopause as a time of loss, women will hear the real message their bodies are sending -- that this is a time of personal empowerment and positive energy ... and a time for women to break free and thrive.",

        "Title": "Down and Out in the Great Depression: Letters from the Forgotten Man",
        "Authors": "By McElvaine, Robert S. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Down and Out in the Great Depression is a moving, revealing collection of letters by the forgotten men, women, and children who suffered through one of the greatest periods of hardship in American history. Sifting through some 15,000 letters from government and private sources, Robert McElvaine has culled nearly 200 communications that best show the problems, thoughts, and emotions of ordinary people during this time.Unlike views of Depression life \"from the bottom up\" that rely on recollections recorded several decades later, this book captures the daily anguish of people during the thirties. It puts the reader in direct contact with Depression victims, evoking a feeling of what it was like to live through this disaster.Following Franklin D. Roosevelt's inauguration, both the number of letters received by the White House and the percentage of them coming from the poor were unprecedented. The average number of daily communications jumped to between 5,000 and 8,000, a trend that continued throughout the Rosevelt administration. The White House staff for answering such letters--most of which were directed to FDR, Eleanor Roosevelt, or Harry Hopkins--quickly grew from one person to fifty.Mainly because of his radio talks, many felt they knew the president personally and could confide in him. They viewed the Roosevelts as parent figures, offering solace, help, and protection. Roosevelt himself valued the letters, perceiving them as a way to gauge public sentiment. The writers came from a number of different groups--middle-class people, blacks, rural residents, the elderly, and children.  Their letters display emotional reactions to the Depression--despair, cynicism, and anger--and attitudes toward relief.In his extensive introduction, McElvaine sets the stage for the letters, discussing their significance and some of the themes that emerge from them. By preserving their original spelling, syntax, grammar, and capitalization, he conveys their full flavor.The Depression was far more than an economic collapse.  It was the major personal event in the lives of tens of millions of Americans. McElvaine shows that, contrary to popular belief, many sufferers were not passive victims of history. Rather, he says, they were \"also actors and, to an extent, playwrights, producers, and directors as well,\" taking an active role in trying to deal with their plight and solve their problems.For this twenty-fifth anniversary edition, McElvaine provides a new foreword recounting the history of the book, its impact on the historiography of the Depression, and its continued importance today.",

        "Title": "The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong Things",
        "Authors": "By Glassner, Barry",
        "Description": "There has never been another era in modern history, even during wartime or the Great Depression, when so many people have feared so much. Three out of four Americans say they feel more fearful today then they did twenty years ago. The Culture of Fear describes the high costs of living in a fear-ridden environment where realism has become rarer than doors without deadbolts.Why do we have so many fears these days? Are we living in exceptionally dangerous times? To watch the news, you\u2019d certainly think so, but Glassner demonstrates that it is our perception of danger that has increased, not the actual level of risk. The Culture of Fear is an expose of the people and organizations that manipulate our perceptions and profit from our fears: politicians who win elections by heightening concerns about crime and drug use even as rates for both are declining; advocacy groups that raise money by exaggerating the prevalence of particular diseases; TV newsmagazines that monger a new scare every week to garner ratings.Glassner spells out the prices we pay for social panics: the huge sums of money that go to waste on unnecessary programs and products as well as time and energy spent worrying about our fears.",

Now, in this deeply personal collection of essays, prayers, and self- reflection, she turns to romantic love.  Enchanted Love envisions a way of being in love with another person and at peace and at one with God and with ourselves. It envisions a reinvention of romantic love as our newest spiritual frontier. In Illuminata Williamson wrote that \"we experience God to the extent to which we love, forgive, and focus on the good in others and ourselves.\" Now, in Enchanted Love, she writes that \"enchanted partnership begins with the conscious understanding, on the part of two people, that the purpose of their relationship is not so much material as spiritual, and the internal skills demanded by it are prodigious.\" High romance, she says, \"is not about past or future. It is not about practicality. It is not about society or worldly routines. It is an audacious ride to the center of what is, at the heart of every person. It is a bold and masterful inquiry into what two people really are and how we might become, while still on earth, the angels who reside within us.\"  Filled with parables and references to classic myths and legends of love, Enchanted Love also contains some of Williamson's beautiful signature prayers to help readers -- single or coupled -- meditate and awaken to the possibilities of romantic enchantment within themselves and with their partners. We can only experience what we are willing to acknowledge, Williamson writes, as she guides us on a sacred journey from our disenchanted worlds to a paradise on earth, where we and our loved ones can give and receive enchanted love.",

The book provides a full and even-handed portrait of the first president, with special emphasis on how he took his rather commonplace talents and transformed them with self-discipline into extraordinary leadership in a time of turmoil. The book pays special attention to Washington's struggles during the Revolution and his tenure as president and deals with his gradual conversion from advocate of nonpartisan politics to a strict Federalist. This book synthesizes the current research in a readable style that affords the general reader an understanding of Washington's special character and his vital role in the making of the United States.",

        "Description": "From Robert Lindsey, best-selling author of The Falcon and the Snowman and The Flight of the Falcon, comes a riveting true story of money, madness, and murder.To Monika Zumsteg, a modest California beauty, it seemed like a fairy tale come true. The quiet, handsome Englishman who rode in on a gleaming motorcycle, who swept her off her feet, and who politely asked her father for her hand in marriage, turned out to be one of the richest men in the world. He is an heir to the billion-dollar fortune of the Vesteys, Britain's second-wealthiest family after the royals.At first, her life in England is idyllic. The newlyweds settle into a sprawling manor house in the countryside. The Vestey Trust picks up all the expenses. Monika learns to ride and hunt foxes, dabbles in Victorian antiques, and even applies to Oxford. She is thrown into a world of wealth and aristocracy beyond her imagination. But what began as a storybook romance soon becomes an unstoppable horror.Her husband, Michael Telling, is sly, deceitful, and wildly erratic. She makes excuses for his lies and his disappearances. In fits of jealousy, he rips apart their home and threatens Monika with knives and guns. A diabetic, he sends himself into insulin shock in a desperate plea to keep her from leaving. Monika discovers that Michael spent much of his privileged childhood in a psychiatric hospital, and she can't resist trying to help him. Besides, his aristocratic family tells the bride from California they are counting on her.Monika's efforts and Michael's promises give the couple a chance to put their marriage back on track. But no matter how hard she tries, Monika never knows what to expect. As the terror in her life increases, she turns to alcohol. Monika and Michael are on a fatal collision course that neither seems able to escape.Irresistible Impulse is a vivid, Hitchcockian account of what became one of England's most celebrated and disturbing criminal cases. It is a complex and complete psychological study, a bone-chilling drama that only Robert Lindsey could write.",

From ocean depths to arctic tundra and ancient forests, the collection of pieces here will bring readers to the major battlefields where the fight for survival is being waged by species such as wolves, sea turtles, and sharks. The role played by human beings in those battles is thoroughly explored, and shown to be no longer exclusively the concern of environmentalists but an issue of increasing importance to ordinary people around the world.",

Are you worried that this kind of forgetfulness will become a more serious problem over time? This book - with its clear explanation of how memory works and its variety of simple strategies to improve memory - will help you do something about this common concern.The first edition of Improving Your Memory received rave reviews in the national media and enthusiastic endorsements from the thousands who benefited from its advice. This revised edition builds on the strengths of the original - it's still fun and easy to read - and now includes even more practical information and proven methods to improve memory for people of all ages.Improving Your Memory will help you with memory improvement techniques that work - and are fun and easy to use; step-by-step descriptions of how to use strategies such as written reminders, the story method, first letter cues, and alphabet search; self-assessment exercises and clear explanations of how the memory process works and how it changes over time; and facts about stress, nutrition, medication, depression, physical illness, and other factors that affect memory.As Americans have become more active and health-conscious in recent years, attitudes about aging have changed dramatically. But, surprisingly, many people still believe that serious memory loss is a natural part of the aging process. Improving Your Memory separates fact from fiction. It explains that, while memory changes do occur as people age, nearly everyone's memory skills can be improved with training and practice. With detailed information and practical strategies for coping with memory changes, this book is an essential resource.",

        "Title": "Altered Fates: Gene Therapy and the Retooling of Human Life",
        "Authors": "By Lyon, Jeff and Gorner, Peter",
        "Description": "As gripping as a novel, this tale of science, medicine, politics, and the jealousies, passions, and dedication of the human heart is certain to be recognized as one of the major nonfiction works of the decade.Seven years in the making, Altered Fates chronicles the saga of gene therapy, a medical revolution unparalleled in human history. Scientists armed with powerful new tools of genetic engineering are attacking such deadly disorders as lung cancer, heart disease, and AIDS by repairing and replacing defective genes. Further, they are racing to find the genes responsible for depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and other psychiatric and neurologic disorders, and they are consummating the marriage of genetics and reproductive technology, raising the possibility of human cloning and the production of \"designer\" babies.In the pages of this rich and detailed narrative, whose characters include the field's leading scientists as well as key patients and their families, the Pulitzer Prize-winning authors tell the story of the race to be the first to do gene therapy (a feat almost certain to garner a Nobel Prize and a place in medical history), uncovering the behind-the-scenes machinations and rivalries among the prima-donna researchers at some of the world's leading medical centers, including the National Institutes of Health. They also reveal the details of the initial human experiments in gene transfer, and the agonizing decisions faced by the families of the first children to be submitted to the therapy.",
