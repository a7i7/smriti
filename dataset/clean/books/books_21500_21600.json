        "Authors": "By Barnett, Thomas P. M.",
        "Description": "Since the end of the Cold War, America's national security establishment has been searching for a new operating theory to explain how this seemingly \"chaotic\" world actually works. Gone is the clash of blocs, but replaced by what?Thomas Barnett has the answers. A senior military analyst with the U.S. Naval War College, he has given a constant stream of briefings over the past few years, and particularly since 9/11, to the highest of high-level civilian and military policymakers-and now he gives it to you. The Pentagon's New Map is a cutting-edge approach to globalization that combines security, economic, political, and cultural factors to do no less than predict and explain the nature of war and peace in the twenty-first century. Building on the works of Friedman, Huntington, and Fukuyama, and then taking a leap beyond, Barnett crystallizes recent American military history and strategy, sets the parameters for where our forces will likely be headed in the future, outlines the unique role that America can and will play in establishing international stability-and provides much-needed hope at a crucial yet uncertain time in world history.For anyone seeking to understand the Iraqs, Afghanistans, and Liberias of the present and future, the intimate new links between foreign policy and national security, and the operational realities of the world as it exists today,The Pentagon's New Map is a template, a Rosetta stone. Agree with it, disagree with it, argue with it-there is no book more essential for 2004 and beyond.",

        "Description": "American soldiers serve willingly. They risk their lives so the rest of us can be safe. The one small thing they ask, though, is that they not be sent into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. But after being lied to about weapons of mass destruction and about the connection between al Qaeda and Iraq; after being forced by stop-loss orders to extend their deployment; after being undertrained, underequipped, and overworked long after George Bush declared Iraq \"Mission Accomplished,\" these soldiers have something to say.  From his famous 2003 Oscar acceptance speech to his record-breaking documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore has been an outspoken critic of the Bush administration and the war in Iraq. But in this book, Moore gives the spotlight to the real heroes of protest: the men and women who have fought in Iraq and want the American public to know how they feel about their mission and their commander in chief. Moore also fields letters from veterans of other wars and mothers, wives, and siblings of our heir anger and frustration, their tears and pain, and their hopes and prayers.  Impassioned, accessible, and moving, these are letters that reveal the true hearts and minds of the men, women, and families on the front line.",

        "Description": "Filling a remarkable gap, Alan Schom, an acclaimed historian, scholar and author, offers the most complete picture ever of Napoleon Bonaparte, \"the scourge of Europe\" and France&#39;s greatest hero. Based on more than 10 years of exhaustive research, Schom illuminates Napoleon&#39;s important economic and social reforms, his reorganization of the French government and his tempestuous personal life and its effect on his political decisions.   Remarkably ambitious and compulsively readable, Napoleon Bonaparte covers every aspect of l&#39;Empereur&#39;s life and career -- from his childhood on Corsica to his dramatic rise to the throne of France; from his campaigns of conquest to his final crushing defeat at Waterloo and death in exile on St. Helena. A lively and accessible text, Schom&#39;s book is generously illustrated with halftones and maps and features startling new insights about Napoleon&#39;s key aides, ministers and generals. Schom portrays Napoleon with candor, exalting his ambition and undeniable genius, but also addressing his dark side -- his ego, his failures and frailties, and the misery caused by his years of warfare across Europe. Powerful, dramatic, colorful and impossible to put down, Napoleon Bonaparte is a biography as complex, challenging and fascinating as the legend himself.",

        "Description": "The first thing you need to know about this city is that it is big. It is difficult to explain to someone who has never seen it. You can fold his town into a corner of one of the city's five separate sectors and still have room for more. The next thing you need to know is that it's dangerous. Never mind the reassuring bulletins from the mayor's office; just watch the first ten minutes of the eleven o'clock news and you'll learn exactly what the people of this city are capable of doing to other people in this city. So, if you came here thinking, Gee, there's going to be a neat little murder that takes place in a town house and some blue-haired lady will solve it, then you came to the wrong city at the wrong time of year. In this city, you have to pay attention. In this city, things are happening all the time, all over the place, and you don't have to be a detective to smell evil in the wind.  This week's city tabloids depict the face of a pretty, dead girl who lay sprawled near a park bench not seven blocks from the 87th precinct house, while the late night news reports on the latest exploits of The Cookie Boy, a professional thief who leaves a box of chocolate chip cookies behind after a score. Behind the scenes, detectives Carella and Brown soon discover that this is not your average dead girl, but one with an unusual past. As they piece together her secrets, detectives Meyer and Kling search Isola's pawnshops for items stolen by The Cookie Boy. While the detectives are investigating their cases, one of them is being stalked by the man who killed his father.  Like the city itself, this novel is wonderfully complex and filled with memorable characters, honest dialogue, and breathtaking violence.",

        "Description": "Daniel Mulvaugh is haunted by his failures. He has tried not to think about the death of his closest friend, for which he feels responsible, or the reasons for his mother's lifelong secrecy. He's estranged from his wife and true love, and his ability to connect to his life has begun to elude him. At this impasse, he can no longer find distraction in his pub-happy friends, or fulfillment in dealing with the squalid troubles of his social welfare clients.When fate beckons Daniel in the form of Amos Radcliff, a bizarre ex-merchant marine living in Daniel's childhood apartment, he finds comfort in surrendering to this man's stories about his experiences on the high seas. But Amos isn't all he seems, and Daniel soon realizes that the key to his own past resides somewhere in these increasingly intimate and disturbing tales.Between Amos and Daniel, the story moves back and forth: from the working-class pubs of London to the shantytowns of Bangkok, from a sanatorium for the mentally ill to a South American merchant ship crewed by misanthropic sailors, from this world into a deeper and more mysterious one of primal loss, love, and betrayal.",

She envisioned a new national service corps called Teach For America that would heighten our country's commitment to its most disadvantaged children.One Day, All Children...is the story of one young social entrepreneur and her dream for a better America. It reveals the struggles of an organization created by and for young idealists. But more importantly, it explores the growth of a new civil rights movement, a movement that demands equal educational opportunity for all Americans. Wendy's vision is that one day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education. In this book, she shows us that we can make her vision a reality.",

        "Title": "Lean Thinking : Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation",
        "Authors": "By Womack, James P. and Jones, Daniel T.",
        "Description": "In their landmark book The Machine That Changed the World, James Womack and Daniel Jones, two of the top industrial analysts in the world, explained how companies can dramatically improve their performance through the \"lean production\" approach pioneered by Toyota. Lean Thinking extends these ideas to provide a rallying cry for today's corporate leaders.  After a decade of downsizing and reengineering, most companies in North America, Europe, and Japan are still stuck, searching for a formula for sustainable growth and success. The problem, as Womack and Jones explain in Lean Thinking, is that managers have lost sight of value for the customer and how to create it. By focusing on their existing organizations and outdated definitions of value, managers create waste, and the economies of the advanced countries continue to stagnate.  What's needed instead is lean thinking to help managers clearly specify value, to line up all the value-creating activities for a specific product along a value stream, and to make value flow smoothly at the pull of the customer in pursuit of perfection. The first part of the book describes each of these concepts and makes them come alive with striking examples.  As Lean Thinking clearly demonstrates, these simple ideas can breathe new life into any company in any industry, routinely doubling both productivity and sales while stabilizing employment. But most managers will need guidance on how to make the lean leap in their firm. Part II provides a step-by-step action plan, based on in-depth studies of fifty lean companies in a wide range of industries across the world -- including Pratt & Whitney, Porsche, and Toyota.  Even those readers who believe they have embraced lean thinking will discover in Part III that another dramatic leap is possible by creating a lean enterprise for each of their product families that tightly links all value-creating activities from concept to product launch, from order to delivery, and from raw materials into the arms of the consumer. This new concept takes the best features from the American, German, and Japanese industrial traditions and recombines them in a way that can be applied to every economic activity, from long-distance travel to construction to health care.  Lean Thinking does not provide a new management \"program\" for the one-minute manager. Instead, it offers a new way of thinking, being, and doing for the serious manager -- one that will change the world.",

No one is more qualified to provide that analysis than Ed Gillespie: In Winning Right, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee draws from lessons learned in more than twenty years of campaign strategy and national policy debate -- most especially from his role at the heart of the historic and groundbreaking 2004 presidential election -- to reveal how the game of politics is played on its highest level. In a frank and engaging narrative, he looks inside the George W. Bush presidency and beyond, to discuss such topics as    A political code of ethics and playing by the rules   Successes and failures in campaign planning and execution   The role of old and new media   The battle for the Supreme Court   Hot-button issues   The future of the GOP -- and how to win right in 2008",

Organized by the stages along life's journey, The Moral Compass moves from the first character lessons taught in the home, which shape the way children see life, to the countless choices that call the virtues into play as they grow older. The stories and poems serve as reference points on a moral compass, guiding the reader through the ethical and spiritual challenges along the pathway of life: leaving home, entering into marriage, easing the burdens of others, nurturing one's children , and fulfilling the obligations of citizenship and leadership.The Moral Compass offers well-known examples from Western history and mythology along with a wider selection of tales and folklore from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Drawing on familiar authors such as Hans Christian Andersen, Washington Irving, Leo Tolstoy, and John Milton, as well as on intriguing but forgotten tales from centuries past, the stories in the Moral Compass are literary and evocative, designed to inspire as well as instruct.",

But now, help is at hand, because this wonderful little book will teach you the rules so that you can conquer life's challenges and manage its unpredictable ups and downs.For one of her workshops several years ago, Ch\u00e9rie Carter-Scott, a corporate trainer and consultant, composed a list of basic truths about life, which she named \"The Ten Rules for Being Human.\" Right away, the Rules resonated with her clients, who photocopied and passed the list to friends and relatives. Within months, Ch\u00e9rie's Rules were in thousands of homes all over the country, and eventually, they were published in Chicken Soup for the Soul and have also appeared in Ann Landers' column. Although there's no formula to help you win the game of life, Ch\u00e9rie's Rules convey a universal wisdom that, once understood and embraced, can contribute to meaningful relationships with ourselves and others, at work and in the home.In If Life Is a Game, These Are the Rules, Ch\u00e9rie shares that there are no mistakes in life, only lessons that are repeated. In thoughtful, inspirational essays illustrated with encouraging personal anecdotes, she includes the lessons that can be learned from each of the Rules and offers insights on self-esteem, respect, acceptance, forgiveness, ethics, compassion, humility, gratitude, and courage. Best of all, Ch\u00e9rie shows that wisdom lies inside each one of us and that by putting the Ten Rules for Being Human into action we can create a more fulfilling life.",

This extraordinary presentation of some 85 works pays tribute to this strength of American collecting, while offering a fresh and engaging account of the history of painting in Britain from the sixteenth century to the present. The selection is drawn from collections from around the United States, both public and private, and includes spectacular pictures from the Yale Center for British Art and the Huntington Art Collections in California--the two leading collections of British art in America. Among the highlights are such masterpieces as Sir Anthony Van Dyck\u2019s portrait of Queen Henrietta Maria with her dwarf, Sir Jeffrey Hudson, William Hogarth\u2019s Beggar\u2019s Opera, Thomas Gainsborough\u2019s Blue Boy, Henry Fuseli\u2019s Nightmare, John Constable\u2019s Hadleigh Castle, J. M. W. Turner\u2019s Staffa, Fingal\u2019s Cave, and William Holman Hunt\u2019s Lady of Shalott. Following introductory essays by Malcolm Warner on anglophilia and art, and by Robyn Asleson on the history of collecting British art in the States, each painting is reproduced in color, with a discussion of its artistic importance and the circumstances of its crossing the Atlantic.",

He examines history, psychology, and political science for explanations of what propels a citizen to raise a machete against innocent neighbors, and, in a moving conclusion, suggests practical ways for humankind to eradicate the causes of mass hate.

        "Authors": "By Greenberg, David and Cabinet Magazine",
        "Description": "What were the leaders of the free world really doing during all those meetings? As the creators of Cabinet magazine reveal here for the first time, they were doodling. Our Founding Fathers doodled, and so did Andrew Jackson. Benjamin Harrison accomplished almost nothing during his time in the White House, but he left behind some impressive doodles. During the twentieth century--as the federal bureaucracy grew and meetings got longer--the presidential doodle truly came into its own. Theodore Roosevelt doodled animals and children, while Dwight Eisenhower doodled weapons and self-portraits. FDR doodled gunboats, and JFK doodled sailboats. Ronald Reagan doodled cowboys and football players and lots of hearts for Nancy. The nation went wild for Herbert Hoover's doodles: A line of children's clothing was patterned on his geometric designs. The creators of Cabinet magazine have spent years scouring archives and libraries across America. They have unearthed hundreds of presidential doodles, and here they present the finest examples of the genre. Historian David Greenberg sets these images in context and explains what they reveal about the inner lives of our commanders in chief. Are Kennedy's dominoes merely squiggles, or do they reflect deeper anxieties about the Cold War? Why did LBJ and his cabinet spend so much time doodling caricatures of one another? Smart, revealing, and hilarious -- Presidential Doodles is the ideal gift for anyone interested in politics or history. And for anyone that doodles!",

        "Description": "Command of Office reveals the remarkable-and dangerous-concentration of power in the American presidency over the course of the twentieth century, told through incisive analyses of the eighteen men who have held the office and the events that shaped their presidencies. Stephen Graubard tracks the steady expansion of secrecy as a tool of presidential authority, one that inevitably diminished the power of the other two branches of government. Widely esteemed by his fellow historians and with unique access to former members of both Republican and Democratic administrations, Graubard has written a masterful history of presidential power-essential reading for anyone concerned with American politics.",

        "Title": "This Is Cuba: An Outlaw Culture Survives",
        "Authors": "By Corbett, Ben",
        "Description": "Beyond the throngs of tourists streaming through Central Havana's broad Prado Avenue, and outside the yoke of Castro's 43-year-old Revolutionary program, there exists a parallel Cuba - a separate evolution of a people struggling to survive. With personal stories that depict a people torn between following the directives of their government and finding a way to better their lot, journalist Ben Corbett gives us the daily life of many considered outlaws by Castro's regime. But are they outlaws or rather ingenious survivors of what many Cubans consider to be a forty-year mistake, a tangle of contradictions that has resulted in a strange hybrid of American-style capitalism and a homegrown black market economy.At a time when Cuba walks precariously on the ledge between socialism and capitalism, This Is Cuba gets to the heart of this so-called outlaw culture, taking readers into the living rooms, rooftops, parks, and city streets to hear stories of frustration, hope, and survival. Updated with a new preface.",
