        "Description": "Richard North Patterson\u2019s masterful portrayals of law and politics at the apex of power have made him one of our most important writers of popular fiction. Combining a compelling narrative, exhaustive research, and a sophisticated grasp of contemporary society, his bestselling novels bring explosive social problems to vivid life through characters who are richly imagined and intensely real. Now in Balance of Power Patterson confronts one of America\u2019s most inflammatory issues\u2013the terrible toll of gun violence.President Kerry Kilcannon and his fianc\u00e9e, television journalist Lara Costello, have at last decided to marry. But their wedding is followed by a massacre of innocents in a lethal burst of gunfire, challenging their marriage and his presidency in ways so shattering and indelibly personal that Kilcannon vows to eradicate gun violence and crush the most powerful lobby in Washington\u2013the Sons of the Second Amendment (SSA).Allied with the President\u2019s most determined rival, the resourceful and relentless Senate Majority Leader Frank Fasano, the SSA declares all-out war on Kerry Kilcannon, deploying its arsenal of money, intimidation, and secret dealings to eviscerate Kilcannon\u2019s crusade\u2013and, it hopes, destroy his presidency. This ignites a high-stakes game of politics and legal maneuvering in the Senate, the courtroom, and across the country, which the charismatic but untested young President is determined to win at any cost. But in the incendiary clash over gun violence and gun rights, the cost to both Kilcannons may be even higher than he imagined.And others in the crossfire may also pay the price: the idealistic lawyer who has taken on the gun industry; the embattled CEO of America\u2019s leading gun maker; the war-hero senator caught between conflicting ambitions; the female senator whose career is at risk; and the grief-stricken young woman fighting to emerge from the shadow of her sister, the First Lady.The insidious ways money corrodes democracy and corrupts elected officials . . . the visceral debate between gun-rights and gun-control advocates . . . the bitter legal conflict between gun companies and the victims of gun violence . . . a ratings-driven media that both manipulates and is manipulated\u2013Richard North Patterson weaves these engrossing themes into an epic novel that moves us with its force, passion, and authority.",

        "Title": "Miseducation: Preschoolers at Risk",
        "Authors": "By Elkind, David",
        "Description": "David Elkind\u2019s new book is designed to help parents avoid the miseducation of young children that is on the increase today.Across the country\u2014in schools and in homes\u2014educational programs intended for school-age children are being misappropriated for the instruction of preschoolers. Books, lectures, and the media propagate the idea that only a \u201csuperkid\u201d can grow up to compete successfully in the adult world\u2014thereby encouraging parents to teach infants and young children academic and athletic skills. Yet, there is considerable evidence that early instruction can do lasting harm\u2014that young children subjected to this kind of pressure are, in fact, at psychological and physical risk. Dr. Elkind shows us the very real difference between the mind of a preschool child (how it works) and that of a school-age child. He makes clear how much young children can and do learn when they are presented with developmentally appropriate parenting practices and education. He shows us how healthy education supports and encourages the spontaneous learning process through which young children explore and understand their immediate world, and how miseducation ignores it, attempting to teach the wrong things at the wrong time. And, in turn, we see how early miseducation can cause permanent damage to a child\u2019s self-esteem, the loss of the positive attitude a child needs for learning the blocking of natural gifts and potential talents.Finally, Dr. Elkind discusses what parents should look for when deciding upon the initial stages of their children\u2019s education and what preschool programs are the most considerate of the individual child. In a special section, he answers the most common questions he\u2019s heard from parents.",

        "Authors": "By Douglas, Kyan, Filicia, Thom, Kressley, Carson, Rodriguez, Jai, and Allen, Ted",
        "Description": "Imagine this: Five eminently stylish and hilariously witty gay men -- authoritative experts in food and wine, grooming, decorating, fashion, and culture -- invade your life, assess your strengths and weaknesses, and, in the course of a day, make you better dressed, better groomed, better mannered, and a better cook, living in a better home. All of this is painless (unless you have a really egregious body-hair situation), liberating, and downright fun. This is what Queer Eye for the Straight Guy does each week on one of the hottest TV shows in memory, as the Fab 5 -- Ted Allen, Kyan Douglas, Thom Filicia, Carson Kressley, and Jai Rodriguez -- turn an everyman frog into an every-girl's-dream prince.  And this is what the book offers: the essential \"make better\" advice from each of the Fab 5. Just like the show, the book focuses on easy but lasting lifestyle transformation -- the tasks, the projects, the modest purchases, and, most important, the new attitudes that immediately make a noticeable difference.From Kyan's instructions on how often to wash your hair to Carson's explanation of why shirts are the new ties, from Ted's strategies for ordering wine and Thom's suggestions on a better bathroom to Jai's hints on shaking hands, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is filled with clear, direct advice on the issues that confront every man. But Queer Eye doesn't try to make you dress like Carson or dance like Jai; it's about teaching you how to refine your own personal style, without throwing away your entire closet and buying a whole new everything. It's about helping you realize the best expression of yourself -- the real you.Queer Eye introduces men to the rewards that women -- and a lot of gay men -- have long reaped by thinking about the day-to-day details that make them look better, feel better, and get more out of life. Many straight men have long felt that these subjects are not for them. Nothing could be sillier. In this book, the Fab 5 sets them straight (so to speak).",

For forty years, Studs Terkel's daily radio talk show, based in Chicago, has won him national recognition. His best-selling books, including Hard Times, Working, and his Pulitzer Prize-winner \"The Good War,\" are classics of oral history and have brought him international fame.In this meeting of the maestros, Tony Parker recounts Terkel's life story using Terkel's own method, that of the tape-recorded interview. Through a kaleidoscope of voices - from John Kenneth Galbraith, Mike Royko, and Calvin Trillin to Terkel's office assistant, his family, friends, and the people with whom he's worked - the master interviewer gradually emerges. But the soul of the book is found in Parker's extended interviews with Terkel himself.This is the first biography with which Terkel has cooperated, and in a series of fascinating conversations we come to know not only the highlights of his life but also the personality of the man who can discover the essence of people's lives in their answers to his questions.",

        "Title": "The Scorpio Illusion",
        "Authors": "By Ludlum, Robert",
        "Description": "His name defines the international thriller. Now Robert Ludlum has crafted his most suspenseful, most surprising novel since The Bourne Identity - a multileveled, deftly plotted story of a brilliant and seductive woman who lives single-mindedly for revenge; the Scorpios, the powerful, shadowy forces that support her; and the one man who must find her before it is too late.Amaya Bajaratt is beautiful, elusive - and deadly. Born in a remote Basque village, she watched, a wide-eyed ten-year-old, as bayonet-wielding soldiers brutally beheaded her parents - and at that moment vowed death to all authority. Now the one man she loved has been killed in a terrorist raid and Bajaratt, an accomplished assassin and mistress of disguise and deception, has set in motion a bold act of vengeance: a masterful plan to strike with one violent blow at the heads of Israel, England, France, and the United States.To find her, a desperate intelligence community turns to Tyrell Hawthorne. Hawthorne was a naval intelligence officer - one of the best - until the rain-swept night in Amsterdam when he learned that his wife had been murdered, a victim of the games spies play. Since then, Hawthorne has carved out a new life, sailing charters in the islands. But he's never forgotten the unanswered questions he left behind in Amsterdam.Now Hawthorne is about to be drawn into the deadliest game of all, as a large transfer of black funds makes its way from Bahrain to an offshore bank...a mysterious woman embarks from Marseilles on a mission of violence and mayhem...and a clandestine network of wealthy, well-placed men and women - the Scorpios - move behind the scenes in the nation's capital to do Bajaratt's bidding and to consolidate their own power.The key to this chilling conspiracy waits on one of the Caribbean's hundreds of uncharted islands.No one knows these deceptive waters better than Tye Hawthorne.No one - except the brilliant, lethal Bajaratt herself - has mastered the moves of the hunt more cunningly than he.No one else can stop her.Racing from a millionaire recluse's island fortress to the social whirl of Palm Beach, from lush Virginia estates to the Oval Office itself, with the lightning-swift pace and tightly woven plotting of such number-one New York Times bestsellers as The Icarus Agenda and The Bourne Ultimatum, The Scorpio Illusion is vintage Robert Ludlum - a high-voltage tale of intrigue that hurtles the reader forward from the first breathtaking page to the stunning, explosive conclusion.",

Now, with more than fourteen million books in print and seven New York Times bestsellers, Judith McNaught brings us her latest, most enthralling novel...  REMEMBER WHEN  When multinational tycoon Cole Harrison approached her on a moonlit balcony at the White Orchid Charity Ball, Diana Foster had no idea how extraordinary the night ahead would be. The most lavish social event of the Houston season had brought out American aristocracy, Texas-style, in glittering array. So, after losing her fianc\u00e9 to a blond Italian heiress and reading about it in a sleazygossip paper, the lovely Diana felt obliged to make an appearance-if only to save face and to bolster her company's image. Foster's Beautiful Living magazine was her family's sucess story, and Diana knew that, single, childless, and suddenly unengaged, she was not living up to its lucrative image of upscale domestic tranquility. A women of gentle grace and kindness, Diana deeply valued her privacy andher dignity, both of which were at risk that night among certain rumor-driven socialites. And now the pride of Dallas billionaires, Cole Harrison, was closing in on her with two crystal flutes and a bottle of champagne... The tall, lithe former stableboy couldn't negotiate his way out of a contract with his crusty uncle, Cal-he had to bring home a wife, and soon, or see Cal's share of the business Cole had created go to an undeserving relative. A man as coolly analytical as he was arrestingly attractive, Cole decided that his bride-to-be should be rich in her own right, meltingly beautiful, and a woman of impeccable character... Diana Foster!It was the perfect to their respective dilemmas, and, after a lot of champagne for Diana and some skilled persuasion from Cole, their lips met in a long, slow, bargain-sealing kiss. Neither one dared imagine that a match made in logic's heaven might be headed straight for an unexpected, once-in-a-lifetime love... Once again, Judith McNaught creates an unforgettable world filled with her \"very special of dazzling wit, passion, and tender sensuality\" (Romantic Times). As a proud woman and a wary man begin to taste the delights and the treacheries of romance, the drama smolders deliciously in this suspenseful, richly satisfying novel. Graced with a deep understanding of love's surprises, it's a tale that can only come froma supremely gifted storyteller, one who makes us so happy to...REMEMBER WHEN.",

Now, she creates breathtaking suspense and harrowing plot twists in her thrilling new page-turner graced with the unforgettable characters and vivid, atmospheric details that flow from the rich imagination of such a gifted writer. Welcome to Judith McNaught at high voltage -- in her most masterful, enthralling novel yet.  The heady social whirl of San Francisco and Palm Beach are utterly foreign to Sloan Reynolds. A dedicated and popular policewoman in a small Florida community, petite, blond Sloan values her investigative work more than a Dior dress. As a child, Sloan was aware that the small-town life she shared with her divorced mother was a long way from the rarefied world of privilege inhabited by her socialite father and her elegant sister, Paris. Yet, instead of resenting her sister, Sloan dreamed secretly of being reunited with the family she'd never known. Total strangers to her, they have never tried to contact Sloan -- until her father's heart attack is followed by a sudden invitation to meet him and Paris, and indulge in the Palm Beach social season.  Now, unmoved by his long overdue parental gesture, Sloan ignores the request, until FBI agent Paul Richardson informs her that her father and his associates are being investigated for fraud, conspiracy, and murder. Richardson persuades her to accept her father's invitation, and to bring him along as her \"significant other.\"  Sloan's on top of the game, until she meets Noah Maitland, a powerfully attractive multinational corporate player, and one of the FBI's prime suspects. Instantly she senses that he is the kind of man she is most afraid of wanting, let alone loving. The intoxicating mix of wealth, glamour, and lush living turns sinister when an FBI informant is murdered and another killing takes a shocking personal toll on Sloan. The evidence points to her father, whom she wants so desperately to trust, and to Noah, whom she loves so completely against her will.  As Sloan's respect for justice and her growing trust in Paul Richardson battle with the deepest instincts of her heart, she must maneuver through a web of deceit and passion, hope and fear, to decipher the meaning of the images that haunt her nightmares, and the truth behind those terrifying whispers in the dark....",

And so Max Frankel found his career. His book, like his life, moves through Hitler's Berlin, Khrushchev's Moscow, Castro's Havana, and the Washington of Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. It reevaluates the Cold War and interweaves Frankel's personal and professional lives with the era's greatest stories, from Sputnik to the Pentagon Papers, from the building of the Berlin Wall to its collapse, all the while tracking the tensions of managing the world's greatest newspaper.",

        "Title": "The Conquerors: Roosevelt, Truman and the Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1941-1945",
        "Authors": "By Beschloss, Michael R.",
        "Description": "From one of America's most respected historians, The Conquerors reveals one of the most important stories of World War II. As Allied soldiers fought the Nazis, Franklin Roosevelt and, later, Harry Truman fought in private with Churchill and Stalin over how to ensure that Germany could never threaten the world again. Eleven years in the writing, drawing on newly opened American, Soviet and British documents as well as private diaries, letters and secret audio recordings, Michael Beschloss's gripping narrative lets us eavesdrop on private conversations and telephone calls among a cast of historical giants. The book casts new light upon Roosevelt's concealment of what America knew about Hitler's war against the Jews and his foot-dragging on saving refugees; FDR's actions so shocked his closest friend in the Cabinet, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., that Morgenthau risked their friendship by accusing the President of \"acquiescence\" in the \"murder of the Jews.\" After the Normandy invasion, \"obsessed\" by what he had learned about the Nazis and the Holocaust, Morgenthau drew up a secret blueprint for the Allies to crush Germany by destroying German mines and factories after the European victory. As The Conquerors shows, FDR endorsed most of Morgenthau's plan, and privately pressured a reluctant Churchill to concur. Horrified, Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Secretary of War Henry Stimson leaked the plan to the press at the zenith of the 1944 campaign. Hitler's propagandist Joseph Goebbels denounced the Roosevelt-Churchill \"Jewish murder plan\" and claimed it would kill forty-three million Germans. Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey charged that by stiffening German resistance, publicity about Morgenthau's plan had cost many U.S. soldiers' lives. The Conquerors explores suspicions that Soviet secret agents manipulated Roosevelt and his officials to do Stalin's bidding on Germany. It reveals new information on FDR's hidden illnesses and how they affected his leadership -- and his private talk about quitting his job during his fourth term and letting Harry Truman become President. It shows us FDR's final dinner, in April 1945, in Warm Springs, Georgia, at which the President and Morgenthau were still arguing over postwar Germany. Finally it shows how the unprepared new President Truman managed to pick up the pieces and push Stalin and Churchill to accede to a bargain that would let the Anglo-Americans block Soviet threats against Western Europe and ensure that the world would not have to fear another Adolf Hitler.",

The result is a biography that clarifies a life long blurred by myth and half-truth.",

        "Authors": "By Posner, Gerald L.",
        "Description": "The result of two years of meticulous research, and based on hundreds of new interviews and documents, Citizen Perot strips away the mythology and unmasks the real Ross Perot for the first time. This groundbreaking book discloses the inside story of how Perot made his fortune; uncovers the tremendous influence he wielded with different presidents; presents the complete saga of his rescue mission from Iran; exposes the private wars he waged against government officials and business competitors he considered corrupt; explains the secret battles that created his animosity with George Bush; and, finally, reveals what was behind Perot's unusual charges of Republican dirty tricks in the 1992 campaign.At the heart of this investigation is Perot himself. Based in part on Perot's own unprecedented cooperation with author Gerald Posner, this book narrates a life that is rich in detail and unique for what it has attempted and accomplished. Studying Perot from his childhood to his current effort to create a third political party, Posner delivers an exhaustive inspection that cuts through years of misinformation and distortions to lay bare Perot's accumulation and use of power. In the process, it answers the perplexing question of what motivates Perot. It also shows whether he has the temperament and personality to be an effective president. Citizen Perot is an absorbing examination of a man who has become an American icon.",

Snow once dubbed \"the Two Cultures\"-art and science. In Darwin's Audubon, Weissmann examines the powerful influence that the two exert over one another and how they have helped each other evolve. From listening to the scientists who gather ever year to sing at the Woods Hole Cantata Consort to looking at the influence of Audubon's watercolors on Darwin's On the Origin of Species; from comparing William Carlos Williams's poetry to his unedited case books to watching Oliver Wendell Holmes grow as doctor and as poet, Weissmann weaves a rich tapestry that will delight fans and newcomers alike.",

Note the similarities in yours and his, the high vaulted chambers of your dreams, the shadowed halls, the locked storerooms where you dare not go, the scrap of half-forgotten music, the muffled cries from behind a wall.In one of the most eagerly anticipated literary events of the decade, Thomas Harris takes us once again into the mind of a killer, crafting a chilling portrait of insidiously evolving evil\u2014a tour de force of psychological suspense.  Seven years have passed since Dr. Hannibal Lecter escaped from custody, seven years since FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling interviewed him in a maximum security hospital for the criminally insane.  The doctor is still at large, pursuing his own ineffable interests, savoring the scents, the essences of an unguarded world.  But Starling has never forgotten her encounters with Dr. Lecter, and the metallic rasp of his seldom-used voice still sounds in her dreams.  Mason Verger remembers Dr. Lecter, too, and is obsessed with revenge.  He was Dr. Lecter's sixth victim, and he has survived to rule his own butcher's empire.  From his respirator, Verger monitors every twitch in his worldwide web.  Soon he sees that to draw the doctor, he must have the most exquisite and innocent-appearing bait; he must have what Dr. Lecter likes best.  Powerful, hypnotic, utterly original, Hannibal is a dazzling feast for the imagination.  Prepare to travel to hell and beyond as a master storyteller permanently alters the world you thought you knew.",
