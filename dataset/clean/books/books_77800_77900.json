        "Title": "13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown",
        "Authors": "By Johnson, Simon and Kwak, James",
        "Description": "Even after the ruinous financial crisis of 2008, America is still beset by the depredations of an oligarchy that is now bigger, more profitable, and more resistant to regulation than ever. Anchored by six megabanks\u2014Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley\u2014which together control assets amounting, astonishingly, to more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, these financial institutions (now more emphatically \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d) continue to hold the global economy hostage, threatening yet another financial meltdown with their excessive risk-taking and toxic \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d practices. How did this come to be\u2014and what is to be done? These are the central concerns of13 Bankers, a brilliant, historically informed account of our troubled political economy.In 13 Bankers, Simon Johnson\u2014one of the most prominent and frequently cited economists in America (former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Professor of Entrepreneurship at MIT, and author of the controversial \u201cThe Quiet Coup\u201d inThe Atlantic)\u2014and James Kwak give a wide-ranging, meticulous, and bracing account of recent U.S. financial history within the context of previous showdowns between American democracy and Big Finance: from Thomas Jefferson to Andrew Jackson, from Theodore Roosevelt to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They convincingly show why our future is imperiled by the ideology of finance (finance is good, unregulated finance is better, unfettered finance run amok is best) and by Wall Street\u2019s political control of government policy pertaining to it.As the authors insist, the choice that America faces is stark: whether Washington will accede to the vested interests of an unbridled financial sector that runs up profits in good years and dumps its losses on taxpayers in lean years, or reform through stringent regulation the banking system as first and foremost an engine of economic growth. To restore health and balance to our economy, Johnson and Kwak make a radical yet feasible and focused proposal: reconfigure the megabanks to be \u201csmall enough to fail.\u201dLucid, authoritative, crucial for its timeliness, 13 Bankers is certain to be one of the most discussed and debated books of 2010.",

        "Title": "So You Don't Want to Go to Church Anymore",
        "Authors": "By Jacobsen, Wayne and Coleman, Dave",
        "Description": "Jake Colsen, an overworked and disillusioned pastor, happens into a stranger who bears an uncanny resemblance (in manner) to the apostle John. A number of encounters with John as well as a family crisis lead Jake to a new understanding of what his life should be like: one filled with faith bolstered by a steady, close relationship with the God of the universe. Facing his own disappointment with Christianity, Jake must forsake the habits that have made his faith rote and rediscover the love that captured his heart when he first believed.Compelling and intensely personal, SO YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO CHURCH ANYMORE relates a man's rebirth from performance-based Christianity to a loving friendship with Christ that affects all he does, thinks, and says. As John tells Jake, \"There is nothing the Father desires for you more than that you fall squarely in the lap of his love and never move from that place for the rest of your life.\"",

        "Title": "The Promise: President Obama, Year One",
        "Authors": "By Alter, Jonathan",
        "Description": "Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration as president on January 20, 2009, inspired the world. But the great promise of \u201cChange We Can Believe In\u201d was immediately tested by the threat of another\u00a0Great Depression, a worsening war in Afghanistan, and an entrenched and deeply partisan system of business as usual in Washington. Despite all the coverage, the backstory of Obama\u2019s historic first year in office has until now remained a mystery.In The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Jonathan Alter, one of the country\u2019s most respected journalists and historians, uses his unique access to the White House to produce the first inside look at Obama\u2019s difficult debut. What happened in 2009 inside the Oval Office? What worked and what failed? What is the president really like on the job and off-hours, using what his best friend called \u201ca Rubik\u2019s Cube in his brain?\" These questions are answered here for the first time. We see how a surprisingly cunning Obama took effective charge in Washington several weeks before his election, made trillion-dollar decisions on the stimulus and budget before he was inaugurated, engineered colossally unpopular bailouts of the banking and auto sectors, and escalated a treacherous war not long after settling into office. The Promise is a fast-paced and incisive narrative of a young risk-taking president carving his own path amid sky-high expectations and surging joblessness. Alter reveals that it was Obama alone\u2014\u201cfeeling lucky\u201d\u2014who insisted on pushing major health care reform over the objections of his vice president and top advisors, including his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who admitted that \u201cI begged him not to do this.\u201dAlter takes the reader inside the room as Obama prevents a fistfight involving a congressman, coldly reprimands the military brass for insubordination, crashes the key meeting at the Copenhagen Climate Change conference, and bounces back after a disastrous\u00a0Massachusetts\u00a0election to redeem a promise that had eluded presidents since FDR.In Alter\u2019s telling, the real Obama is an authentic, demanding, unsentimental, and sometimes overconfident leader. He adapted to the presidency with ease and put more \u201cpoints on the board\u201d than he is given credit for, but neglected to use his leverage over the banks and failed to connect well with an angry public. We see the famously calm president cursing leaks, playfully trash-talking his advisors, and joking about even the most taboo subjects, still intent on redeeming more of his promise as the problems mount.This brilliant blend of journalism and history offers the freshest reporting and most acute perspective on the biggest story of our time. It will shape impressions of the Obama presidency and of the man himself for years to come.",

        "Authors": "By Cosby, Rita",
        "Description": "When a father reveals his haunting past, a daughter takes an incredible journey of self-discovery . . . Emmy\u00ae award\u2013winning journalist, TV host, and New York Times bestselling author Rita Cosby has always asked the tough questions in her interviews with the world\u2019s top newsmakers. Now, in a compelling and powerful memoir, she reveals how she uncovered an amazing personal story of heroism and courage, the untold secrets of a man she has known all her life: her father. Years after her mother\u2019s tragic death, Rita finally nerved herself to sort through her mother\u2019s stored belongings, never dreaming what a dramatic story was waiting for her. Opening a battered tan suitcase, she discovered it belonged to her father\u2014the enigmatic man who had divorced her mother and left when Rita was still a teenager. Rita knew little of her father\u2019s past: just that he had left Poland after World War II, and that his many scars, visible and not, bore mute witness to some past tragedy. He had always refused to answer questions. Now, however, she held in her hand stark mementos from the youth of the man she knew only as Richard Cosby, proud American: a worn Polish Resistance armband; rusted tags bearing a prisoner number and the words Stalag IVB; and an identity card for an ex-POW bearing the name Ryszard Kossobudzki. Gazing at these profoundly telling relics, the well-known journalist realized that her father\u2019s story was one she could not allow him to keep secret any longer. When she finally did persuade him to break his silence, she heard of a harrowing past that filled her with immense pride . . . and chilled her to the bone. At the age of thirteen, barely even adolescent, her father had seen his hometown decimated by bombs. By the time he was fifteen, he was covertly distributing anti-Nazi propaganda a few blocks from the Warsaw Ghetto. Before the Warsaw Uprising, he lied about his age to join the Resistance and actively fight the enemy to the last bullet. After being nearly fatally wounded, he was taken into captivity and sent to a German POW camp near Dresden, finally escaping in a daring plan and ultimately rescued by American forces. All this before he had left his teens. This is Richard Cosby\u2019s story, but it is also Rita\u2019s. It is the story of a daughter coming to understand a father whose past was too painful to share with those he loved the most, too terrible to share with a child . . . but one that he eventually revealed to the journalist. In turn, Rita convinced her father to join her in a dramatic return to his battered homeland for the first time in sixty-five years. As Rita drew these stories from her father and uncovered secrets and emotions long kept hidden, father and daughter forged a new and precious bond, deeper than either could have ever imagined.",

        "Description": "Where do you go when the water rises?  For more than twenty years, John Kasich has sought the answer to this question and many of life\u2019s most fundamental challenges in an unlikely place: his twice-a-month lunches with an irreverent, thoughtful, and spirited circle of guys who are members of a Bible study group. Every other Monday over lunch at an Italian restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, Kasich and half a dozen friends use the stories of the Good Book as a launching pad to ask questions running the gamut from \u201cDoes God exist?\u201d to \u201cWhat do you do if faith fails you?\u201d This group, in reaching for life\u2019s biggest mysteries while standing firmly rooted in the everyday, has become a cornerstone of Kasich\u2019s life, one to which he consistently turns when the waters threaten to rise.  Every Other Monday is an honest look at how to build faith and find solace, even during the most heartbreaking circumstances, and offers a template for reconsidering how we make everyday choices as well as life-changing decisions. Along with rousing personal anecdotes and poignant memories, Kasich shares some of the group\u2019s frank discussions on the major themes found in the Bible\u2014and in our daily lives\u2014such as:  \u2022 CHARITY\u2014How do you determine whether you\u2019re giving enough (i.e., \u201cthe fatted calf\u201d vs. \u201cthe skinny calf\u201d) and why does it matter? \u2022 JUSTICE\u2014How do you deal with frustration when justice doesn\u2019t always happen here on earth? \u2022 ENVY\u2014How do you absorb the inevitable disappointment when someone else gets the good fortune that you know was meant for you? \u2022 FORGIVENESS\u2014What do you do when you encounter hurtful behavior? \u2022 AMBITION\u2014How do you balance the demands of work and the material world while still growing spiritually? Every Other Monday is a refreshing and forthright account of one group\u2019s search for answers and meaning. From rebuilding trust to understanding why we sometimes fail in matters of morality even when we know better, it lays out a practical path for finding strength and resilience through faith and friendship.",

August 6, 1943: In his brief career in the Office of Strategic Services, twenty-four-year-old Cletus Frade has already been involved in a lot of unusual situations, but nothing like the one he?s in now, standing with a German lieutenant colonel named Wilhelm Frogger in a Mississippi prisoner-of-war detention facility. Frade?s job? To help Frogger escape. Frogger?s parents are in Frade?s custody in Argentina, because of their involvement in a secret German plan to establish safe havens for senior Nazi officials in South America, and the younger Frogger has agreed to help find out what they know. Even more important, however, is the secret within the secret. Before he was captured in Africa, Frogger was part of a conspiracy; its goal: to assassinate Adolf Hitler. If the OSS can use his knowledge and connections to nudge that plot along, even just a little bit? they may be able to end this war right now. But Frade is not the only one who knows about the Froggers. Even as he stands there in Mississippi, a troop of Germans and Argentinians, led by a Colonel Juan Per\u00f3n, is on its way to kill the parents and, after them, Frade himself. His career in the OSS may have been brief?but it may just be about to be over. Filled with the special flair that Griffin?s fans have come to expect, The Honor of Spies is another rousing adventure from one of our finest storytellers.",

Genesis 6:5 Sister Evangeline was just a girl when her father entrusted her to the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration in upstate New York. Now, at twenty-three, her discovery of a 1943 letter from the famous philanthropist Abigail Rockefeller to the late mother superior of Saint Rose Convent plunges Evangeline into a secret history that stretches back a thousand years: an ancient conflict between the Society of Angelologists and the monstrously beautiful descendants of angels and humans, the Nephilim. For the secrets these letters guard are desperately coveted by the once-powerful Nephilim, who aim to perpetuate war, subvert the good in humanity, and dominate mankind. Generations of angelologists have devoted their lives to stopping them, and their shared mission, which Evangeline has long been destined to join, reaches from her bucolic abbey on the Hudson to the apex of insular wealth in New York, to the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris and the mountains of Bulgaria. Rich in history, full of mesmerizing characters, and wondrously conceived, Angelology blends biblical lore, the myth of Orpheus and the Miltonic visions of Paradise Lost into a riveting tale of ordinary people engaged in a battle that will determine the fate of the world.",

        "Description": "Consultant Schmoker maintains that despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators, buffers still exist in US schools that keep outsiders from looking in and insiders from looking around. He believes the only realistic ways to improve teaching and learning are to eliminate the factors that isolate schools from the community and educators from each other and their students, particularly in the field of literacy education. He advocates turning to authentic literacy and intellectual development, starting with assessing the real results of students and working into a teamwork system that integrates critical and argumentative literacy into every aspect of schooling. As part of the teamwork he supports professional learning community and developing leadership at all stages, including the central office and state levels. An appendix includes a sample agreement for departments. Annotation \u00a92006 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)",

They are looking forward to a quiet romantic weekend out of town. Wouldn\u2019t you know their choice of destination provides them with anything but! Regan and Jack had considered going to Bermuda, but instead they decide to spend four days at his parents\u2019 beautiful beachfront home on Cape Cod, a wonderful spot where they\u2019d never been alone. During the summer the house overflowed with Jack\u2019s family, bubbling with activity from morning until night. But to be up there for a weekend in April, just the two of them, sounded like a perfect escape. Arriving at the Cape late at night, Regan and Jack are just in time to experience the beginning of a major storm. The next morning, Cape Cod Bay is quite a sight, churning with whitecaps. The wind is howling ferociously. Sheets of rain are pelting the house. Regan is looking forward to settling in the den with Jack and watching the storm. However, the best laid plans . . . In the bedroom, Regan opens the curtains to find Skip, the Reillys\u2019 young caretaker, pressing his nose against the glass, supposedly checking for leaks. A moment later, Jack arrives home from the market, two gossipy older women who live up the street in tow. A branch crashed through their living room window, and they need a place to stay. When Regan thought things couldn\u2019t get any worse, Skip comes running into the house, distraught that he\u2019d just discovered Adele Hopkins, the woman renting the house next door, in a heap at the bottom of her staircase to the beach. Regan and Jack run back down with him, but huge waves are crashing on the shore. Hopkins is gone, presumably swept out to sea. Who was Adele Hopkins? No one knows. The sixty-ish loner, who moved in five months ago, shunned her neighbors. Even her landlords, friends of the Reillys, have no idea how to locate her next of kin. Discovered in her dining room are stacks of apology cards she\u2019d not yet sent and bags of decorative pillows that are embroidered with the saying grudge me, grudge me not. Regan and Jack begin an investigation to help their friends track down Hopkins\u2019s family. They start by interviewing two young women who own the shop where Adele had bought the pillows. Pippy and Ellen opened Pillow Talk after they both lost their jobs. When a newspaper article revealing the terrible way the women had been treated by their former employers was posted on the Internet, business took off, they started to become well-known, and the Pillow Talk website became a place for people who had had similar experiences to vent their feelings. Pippy and Ellen just received an anonymous e-mail from someone who spews venom about her former rowing coach\u2014Adele Hopkins. Could she be the same Adele Hopkins? Regan and Jack\u2019s search for clues to this mysterious woman\u2019s identity makes for an anniversary weekend they\u2019ll never forget!",

Can we ever truly control our emotions?

What if faith, not fear, was your default reaction to threats? If you could hover a fear magnet over your heart and extract every last shaving of dread, insecurity, and doubt, what would remain?
