        "Description": "Learn more about the incredible life of an escaped slave turned famous abolitionist, orator, journalist, and author.  Born  into slavery on a Maryland plantation, Frederick Douglass grew up to  have a way with words. Contemporaries found it hard to believe that an  escaped slave with no formal education could be so eloquent. Yet  thousands turned out to hear him speak.  A  tireless advocate to end slavery, Douglass urged slaves to escape and  revolt. He inspired many with his bestselling autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.  Later on, Douglass cemented his status as a pivotal figure in American  history when he helped Abraham Lincoln issue the Emancipation  Proclamation. He continued to fight for equality during Reconstruction  and became the first African American to receive a vote for President of  the United States in a major party's roll call vote.  This  accessible biography for children examines Douglass's amazing life  with easy-to-understand facts and details, alongside elegant  illustrations. Back matter includes a timeline and author's notes.",

In this remarkable collaboration, New York Times bestselling author Luanne Rice and Joseph Monninger combine their unique talents to create a powerfully moving novel of an estranged husband and wife through a series of searching, intimate letters. By way of a correspondence so achingly real you\u2019ll forget it\u2019s fiction, they trace the history of a love affair and of a family before, and after, the moment that changed the course of two people\u2019s journey forever. Sam and Hadley West are both trying in their own ways to survive after the unthinkable loss of their only son in Alaska. For Sam, a sports journalist, acceptance means an arduous trek by dogsled across the bleak and beautiful arctic wilderness to find the place where Paul died. For Hadley, it means renting a benignly haunted, salt-soaked cottage off the Maine coast where she begins to paint again. Now, at opposite ends of the country, waiting for their divorce to be finalized, they begin to exchange letters by post, missives filled with longing and truths they\u2019ve never before voiced, as they recall their marriage\u2014its magic moments and its challenges\u2014and begin to rediscover the reasons they fell in love in the first place. As Sam risks his life to reach the remote crash site, Hadley begins an equally hazardous inner journey to a rendezvous with the mad grief of a mother\u2019s heart. At the place where all else is lost, they will meet again\u2026.",

Not to mention the opposition of greedy despoiler Jerry Landis, a successful venture capitalist who is dying of a rare disease that accelerates the aging process. Landis cares about only two things: making even more money, finding a way to arrest his medical condition. He'll go to any lengths to do either.That brings Landis and his fortune to the wild frontier of biotechnology, where his people are illegally experimenting with cross-species organ transplantation in California while breeding genetically altered primates at a secret site in the piney woods of south central Mississippi. Not only is Paul on the trail of this clandestine research, but there's also an eco-terrorist on the loose, bent on teaching hard lessons to people who are under the impression that the Earth and its creatures are theirs to destroy. These forces, together with 50,000 extra-large chacma baboons, collide in a explosion of laughter and wonder that Bill Fitzhugh's growing league of admirers is coming to recognize as his very own.",

How does the quick adoption of technology affect business success (and how is that related to corn farmers in Iowa)? How do time and money affect the gender of visitors to online dating sites? And how is the Internet itself affecting the way we experience the world? In Click, Bill Tancer takes us behind the scenes into the massive database of online intelligence to reveal the naked truth about how we use the Web, navigate to sites, and search for information--and what all of that says about who we are. As online directories replace the yellow pages, search engines replace traditional research, and news sites replace newsprint, we are in an age in which we've come to rely tremendously on the Internet--leaving behind a trail of information about ourselves as a culture and the direction in which we are headed. With surprising and practical insight, Tancer demonstrates how the Internet is changing the way we absorb information and how understanding that change can be used to our advantage in business and in life. Click analyzes the new generation of consumerism in a way no other book has before, showing how we use the Internet, and how those trends provide a wealth of market research nearly as vast as the Internet itself. Understanding how we change is integral to our success. After all, we are what we click.",

The Secret Sharer is an allegorical examination of a timid man who struggles to stifle the more physical and dangerous part of himself. Eventually, he resolves this duality and becomes more daring\u2014and, therefore, more complete.This concise supplement to Joseph Conrad&#39;s The Heart of Darkness & The Secret Sharer helps you understand the overall structure of the novels, actions and motivations of the characters, and the social and cultural perspectives of the author.

Sass Trimble, the black boy from Bronzeville, \"Chicago's Harlem,\" and Steve Feinberg, a Jewish boy from well-to-do Hyde Park, get on a bus together and get lost in the city. Once free from the neighborhoods that have defined them, the boys explore the city together with enthusiasm, while their families tear each other apart in fear.Steve and Sass spend a day and a night getting more and more lost, and along the way they also lose their inclination to go home. At last the boys discover Riverview -- then \"The world's largest amusement park\" -- where racism catches up to them in the cruelest possible way.The boys\u2019 newfound freedom contrasts sharply with the constraints of the novel\u2019s adult characters, both black and white, whose fear makes them as ready to attack one another as they are to expect attacks. The boys\u2019 families know that Steve and Sass are together, a fact that upsets them as much as the fact that the boys are lost. Racial tensions reach the boiling point when the families meet in a storefront church in Bronzeville, and personal choices are weighed with a shattering clarity against the pressures of the city.",

        "Description": "In this unflaggingly suspenseful story of aspirations and moral redemption, humble, orphaned Pip, a ward of his short-tempered older sister and her husband, Joe, is apprenticed to the dirty work of the forge but dares to dream of becoming a gentleman. And, indeed, it seems as though that dream is destined to come to pass \u2014 because one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of \"great expectations.\" In telling Pip's story, Dickens traces a boy's path from a hardscrabble rural life to the teeming streets of 19th-century London, unfolding a gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, and love and loss. Its compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride.Written in the last decade of Dickens' life, Great Expectations was praised widely and universally admired. It was his last great novel, and many critics believe it to be his finest. Readers and critics alike praised it for its masterful plot, which rises above the melodrama of some of his earlier works, and for its three-dimensional, psychologically realistic characters \u2014 characters much deeper and more interesting than the one-note caricatures of earlier novels. \"In none of his other works,\" wrote the reviewer in the 1861 Atlantic, \"does he evince a shrewder insight into real life, and a cheaper perception and knowledge of what is called the world.\" To Swinburne, the novel was unparalleled in all of English fiction, with defects \"as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadows on a sunlit sea.\" Shaw found it Dickens' \"most completely perfect book.\" Now this inexpensive edition invites modern readers to savor this timeless masterpiece, teeming with colorful characters, unexpected plot twists, and Dickens' vivid rendering of the vast tapestry of mid-Victorian England.",

Young Richard Nixon watched two brothers die of tuberculosis, even while doctors monitored a suspicious shadow on his own lungs. John Kennedy received last rites four times as an adult, and Lyndon Johnson suffered a \"belly buster\" of a heart attack. David Blumenthal and James A. Morone explore how modern presidents have wrestled with their own mortality&#151;and how they have taken this most human experience to heart as they faced the difficult politics of health care. Drawing on a trove of newly released White House tapes, on extensive interviews with White House staff, and on dramatic archival material that has only recently come to light, The Heart of Power explores the hidden ways in which presidents shape our destinies through their own experiences. Taking a close look at Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, the book shows what history can teach us as we confront the health care challenges of the twenty-first century.",

Hawthorne, by birth and education, was instilled with the Puritan belief in America's limitless promise.

According to government statistics, they outnumber good ideas six hundred to one.What Were They Thinking is a compendium of some 400 harebrained schemes, fool notions, and misguided obsessions both grandiose and mundane. In it readers will uncover one man's effort to market a board game based on the Lebanese civil war...an Iowa State University professor's proposal to blow up the moon...and Senator Victor Biaka-Boda's ill-considered campaign trip to the Ivory Coast hinterlands. (Not only did he lose the election, his constituents ate him.)  Within these pages, the aim has not been to probe the motives behind bad ideas, but simply to recount and, above all, revel in them. The stories in What Were They Thinking? range from the horrific to the hilarious; many are both. But none are fanciful. Every item has been carefully researched from published, non-fiction sources such as newspapers, trade journals, magazines, government reports, research studies, corporate literature, and reference books. Says Felton, \"To have been any less exacting in my insistence on accuracy would have been a terrible idea.\"",

The youngest in a family of thieves, scoundrels, and roustabouts, the girl with the flame-colored hair and odd-colored eyes is declared useless by her father from the day she is born. But that's only if you look at her but don't see. For Ivy has a quality that makes people take notice. It's more than beauty -- and it draws people toward her.   Which makes her the perfect subject for an aspiring painter named Oscar Aretino Frosdick, a member of the pre-Raphaelite school of artists. Oscar is determined to make his mark on the art world, with Ivy as his model and muse. But behind Ivy's angelic looks lurk dark secrets and a troubled past -- a past that has given her an unfortunate taste for laudanum. And when treachery and jealousy surface in the Eden that is the artist's garden, Ivy must learn to be more than a pretty face if she is to survive.   Julie Hearn, author of The Minister's Daughter and The Sign of the Raven, has created a memorable tale of nineteenth-century England with a character destined to take her place alongside Dickens's Pip and Oliver Twist.",
