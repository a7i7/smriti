        "Title": "Of Moths and Men: An Evolutionary Tale",
        "Authors": "By Hooper, Judith",
        "Description": "As almost every high school biology student once learned, the peppered moths of England were the most renowned insects in the world. Featured in nearly every science textbook, they acquired their fame through the pioneering work of H. B. D. Kettlewell, a British physician and amateur lepidopterist who went into the woods in the 1950s to use this population of moths to capture \"evolution in action.\" He wanted - needed - to prove that the moths were evolving to a darker color in response to industrial pollution, for this would put the finishing touches on Darwin's theory. As Judith Hooper reveals in this groundbreaking work, Kettlewell's ambitions would exceed the strength of his science, and the story of the \"peppered moth\" would become one of the most pervasive myths in the history of evolutionary biology.About a century earlier, when a dark (\"melanic\") form of the peppered moth appeared in the smoky industrial towns of the British Isles, some people proposed that evolutionary theory might explain why. Resting against the sooty backgrounds, these melanic moths were nearly invisible to birds, and so escaped being preyed upon. Thus more of them survived to reproduce. In rural areas, it was just the opposite. In Darwinian language, natural selection favored the black moths in the grimy mill towns and light moths in rural, unpolluted woodlands. For many decades, this was only a theory, until Kettlewell arrived. He succeeded beyond anyone's expectations, becoming the hero of natural selection, a celebrated figure in a rarefied pantheon of world-class scientists, for his proof of \"industrial melanism.\"Behind the success story, however, lay a darker tale. Based on original documents and interviews with scientists on both sides of the Atlantic as well as friends and relatives of the principal characters, Of Moths and Men chronicles the bitter rivalries, academic jealousies, botched science, and emotional heartbreak of the scientists involved. Kettlewell had been lured into the inner circles of Oxford by the celebrated geneticist Edmund Brisco Ford - a fabulous raconteur, a wildly eccentric don, and an often ruthless zealot bent on establishing his theories of how evolution worked and vanquishing all rivals. Although Kettlewell's experiment became the jewel in the crown of Ford's Oxford fiefdom - and evolution's prize experiment - the relationship between the two men would become troubled. At the very moment that the peppered moth experiments were establishing the Oxford biologists as masters of their world, their personal and professional relationships were disintegrating in a miasma of recriminations, intrigue, backbiting, and shattered dreams.",

        "Title": "Fourth Instinct: The Call of the Soul",
        "Authors": "By Huffington, Arianna",
        "Description": "The Fourth Instinct is an exploration of mankind's forgotten instinct - the most neglected and least understood part of human nature. It is the instinct that compels us to go beyond survival, beyond sexuality, and beyond status and power to find spiritual fulfillment and meaning in our lives.For years biologists and psychologists have described human nature primarily in terms of the three basic instincts. They have explained the instincts that link us to the past, Arianna Huffington writes, but have neglected the instinct that links us to our future. We know more about what we share with the apes than what we share with the angels. Citing a wide variety of examples from our cultural and social landscape, she shows how seeking fulfillment solely through the first three instincts leads inevitably to the aggression, depression, and addiction that scar so many lives. It is only by following the call of the Fourth Instinct, she argues, that we can transform our lives and our relationships with others. She speaks of the need to create a critical mass to change our culture - one person, one problem, one community at a time.In The Fourth Instinct Arianna Huffington describes the dead ends we are led down when we are obsessed by the pursuit of success, wealth, and recognition. She also explores the many threads that can help us find our way back to the still, spiritual center of our lives. Religion, art, science, relationships, and even pain and loss can become threads of meaning from which to weave a new life.Almost every generation believes it lives at a defining moment in history. Some actually do. Arianna Huffington believes that ours is one of them. When she lectures around the country a glimmer of recognition flashes across people's faces when she speaks of our growing longing to find meaning and purpose in our lives as we approach the new millennium. Despite our technological wizardry and cultural sophistication, we have begun searching once more for answers to life's simplest yet most important questions: Who are we? Why are we here? What are our lives about?Based on years of research chronicling people's concerns and hopes, and filled with Arianna Huffington's own personal experiences and insights, The Fourth Instinct is a brilliant and provocative exploration of these age-old questions; it will bring inspiration and purpose to every life it touches.",

But hiding beneath the soot is nothing less-Martin believes-than a lost work by Bruegel. So begins a hilarious trail of lies and concealments, desperate schemes and soaring hopes as Martin, betting all that he owns and much that he doesn't, embarks on a quest to prove his hunch, win his wife over, and separate the painting from its owner. In Headlong, Michael Frayn, \"the master of what is seriously funny\" (Anthony Burgess), offers a procession of superbly realized characters, from the country squire gone to seed to his giddy, oversexed young wife. All are burdened by human muddle and human cravings; all are searching for a moral compass as they grapple with greed, folly, and desire. And at the heart of the clamor is Breugel's vision, its dark tones warning of the real risks of temptation and obsession.With this new novel, Michael Frayn has given us entertainment of the highest order. Supremely wise and wickedly funny, Headlong elevates Frayn into the front rank of contemporary novelists.",

        "Authors": "By Brinkley, Douglas (EDT) and Rubel, David (EDT)",
        "Description": "Introducing a new series where history comes alive in riveting documents and images of great events as they occurredWe have long relied on historians to sift through the debris of history and piece together narratives to shape our understanding of events. But it is in the letters, diaries, speeches, song lyrics, newspaper articles, and government papers that history comes alive. The New York Times Living History books reinvigorate history by presenting the actual documents and images of the day. Eminent historian Douglas Brinkley has carefully chosen fifty critical documents that chart the Axis's grip over Europe and the Pacific-such as Churchill's Blood and Toil speech and the text of the Atlantic Charter. Readers will find FDR's cables to Japan in the hours before Pearl Harbor, Edward R. Murrow's broadcast during the Blitz, an American G.I.'s last message from Corregidor, and a Dutch boy's diary recounting Germany's invasion. Each primary document is accompanied by New York Times reporting or commentary from the period and original text illuminating their historical significance. News photos and other images add a strong visual component to this vivid re-creation of history.

At age five, she was found near death on the steps of a city hospital. A head injury had left her without sight and prevented her from remembering her past. When Sherry discovers she does have sight - sight that transcends death - she learns to use her gift to help others solve mysteries that only she can tap into.Serial killer Earl Sykes was never caught for his vicious murders. Instead, a deadly traffic accident landed him in prison. Now, almost thirty years later, he returns to the seaside town of Wildwood, New Jersey - and to abducting young female victims from desolate areas of the boardwalk for his gruesome games.Wildwood police lieutenant Kelly O'Shaughnessy is stymied over the disappearance of young women from the boardwalk - crimes horrifyingly reminiscent of unsolved cases from the seventies. When an old man's untimely death leads Sherry Moore to Wildwood, O'Shaughnessy's desperation to stem the bloodshed forces her to accept Sherry's help, but not without consequences. As the two women join forces to discover the killer's identity, they unwittingly become the hunted, marching deeper with every step into the monster's lair.",

        "Authors": "By Anderson, Poul",
        "Description": "Winner of seven Hugo and three Nebula Awards, Paul Anderson is one of science fiction's few acknowledged masters. Harvest of Stars is the most ambitious novel of his distinguished career, a compulsively readable saga blending thrilling adventure with a stunning vision of humanity's destiny.Earth lies in the grip of the Avantists, a repressive regime that has crushed dissent and now threatens to extinguish the last bastion of liberty, the maverick interplanetary corporation known as Fireball.His heroine, Kyra Davis, a beautiful and courageous young space pilot, is entrusted with a high-risk mission to rescue an electronic ghost - Fireball's founder, Anson Guthrie, whose mind was stored in a computer after his death - and rally the resistance to strike a blow against tyranny. Pursued by Avantist forces, she and Guthrie engage in a desperate battle of wits against a brilliant adversary: a copy of Guthrie's personality that has been reprogrammed to serve the enemy.In a heart-stopping interstellar odyssey that takes her from Earth's rebel enclaves, to the decadent court of an exotic lunar colony, and the endangered frontier world of Demeter, Kyra Davis plays a crucial role in the struggle to preserve freedom. There under the distant light of Alpha Centauri, Kyra undergoes an awesome transformation to insure the survival of humanity's descendants among the far-flung stars.Blending the cutting-edge themes of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology with classic science fiction storytelling, Poul Anderson's Harvest of Stars is a towering achievement by one of science fiction's most honored writers.With colorful characters as appealing as Robert Heinlein's Friday and Lazarus Long, a future history as compelling as Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" series, and a cosmic vision as astonishing as Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End, Harvest of Stars confirms Poul Anderson's place in the SF pantheon beside the field's most beloved authors.",

        "Description": "How can you learn the keys to achieving the expressions of your potential? How do you make your levels of professional performance second to none? How do you acquire the closely guarded secrets that distinguish outstanding and successful people from the simply average? The answer lies in the time-honored tradition of mentoring. While much has been written about mentoring, few if any books uncover the strategies and methods to finding mentors for every aspect of one's life. Mentoring reveals the secrets to achieving high degrees of success: personal, professional, economic, and emotional through a series of stories and letters illustrating the mentoring relationship. Floyd Wickman and Terri Sjodin (as mentor and protege themselves in writing this book) prove that mentoring can be an important catalyst to success. The authors worked together for five years researching and developing the work, calling upon mentoring experiences of other highly successful and fulfilled people. Mentoring relationships are not only available to a lucky few. As this book explains, anyone can maximize their potential with the help of the right mentor. Readers will discover how to create a successful mentoring lifestyle, including: four basic reasons why mentoring works and the benefits of having a mentor; how to select a good mentor or protege; 16 laws of mentoring; how to involve mentors in every facet of your life from family to fitness to spiritual development; secrets for effectively working with and developng a protege; creating meaningful synergy between mentor and protege.",

It is a long, lively, occasionally dangerous, and endlessly fascinating trip, up the coast of Spain, along the Riviera, by ferry to the islands of Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and beyond - way beyond.By foot, train, bus, and cruise ship, Theroux travels around Italy and the Greek islands, to Albania in a state of near anarchy and to war-torn Croatia. He sails across an old sea of myths into Istanbul, its minarets, mosque domes, and obelisks beckoning him to the Levant. After hearing of Theroux's onward itinerary, a Turkish shipmate murmurs, \"Gechmis olsen!\" - May it be behind you! Ahead are Damascus and the remote villages of Syria, shrouded in the cult of Assad and his martyred son; Israel, besieged by suicide bombers; Egypt, where Theroux visits with Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz, recovering from an assassination attempt. And past the hill that marks the southern Pillar of Hercules lie Morocco and Paul Bowles' Tangier.Exploring coastlines as wild as anything he encountered in China or Peru, probing through layers of tradition and culture, ancient and modern, tawdry and splendid, Theroux recalls the words of his predecessors - Homer, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, Evelyn Waugh, Carlo Levi, Lawrence Durrell - and weaves the legends and siren calls of civilizations as old as time into a tantalizing story about life on the Mediterranean today.",

In The Blessing of a Skinned Knee, author Wendy Mogel introduced a new approach to parenting, one that drew its fundamental principles from Jewish wisdom and emphasized resisting overprotection of our children. With its combination of insight and practicality, the book became a word-of-mouth success and made Mogel a much sought after speaker.  Now, in the long-awaited follow-up to her perennial seller, Mogel addresses the question she is asked most frequently: how to be a parent in a culture that breeds anxiety and fragility in older children and teens by placing too high a value on perfection and success. Applying concepts from mussar (a Jewish system of character refinement that focuses on ethical behavior) and other teachings, Mogel shows parents how to stop overindulging or pressuring their children and instead focus on developing sound judgment. By practicing composure, detachment, acceptance, moderation, integrity, authority, and delight\u2014the traits covered in the seven chapters\u2014parents will not only uncover an appreciative and reflective relationship with their children, but will also set an example of the adults they want them to become.   An important and inspiring book, The Blessing of a B Minus  encourages parents to see beyond the drama of teenage crises and the competitiveness of college applications to the goal of raising resilient, optimistic adults.",

Later, a body of quatrains became attached to his name, although not all were his works. These verses lay in obscurity until 1859, when Edward FitzGerald (1809\u20131883), an English country gentleman, published a free adaptation of this Persian poetry. After its discovery by D. G. Rossetti and others, the verse became extremely popular. Essentially a hedonist and a skeptic, Omar Khayy\u00e1m, through FitzGerald, spoke with both an earthy and spiritual freedom that stirred a universal response. As a result, the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t became one of the best-known and most often quoted English classics. The fifth edition, published posthumously in 1889, was based on FitzGerald's handwritten changes in a copy of the fourth edition, and is traditionally printed with the first edition.",

Next the various types of fruits are described \u2014 drupe, berry, pome, legume, follicle, capsule, achene, samara, nut \u2014 and fruiting habits, followed by a synoptic summary of fruit types.The introduction to the twig key tells in plain language the process of growth and its relation to twig morphology through leaf scars, branch scars, buds, etc. For the benefit of the unwary, poison-ivy, poison-oak and poison-sumac are immediately and fully described.Identification in both books is easy. There is a pair of alternative descriptions of each aspect of the specimens. Your choice of the fitting one leads you automatically to the next proper pair. At the end of the chain is the name of your specimen and, as a double check, a photograph. More than 120 different fruits and 160 different twigs are distinguished.This exceptional work, widely used in university courses in botany, biology, forestry, etc., is a valuable tool and instructor to the naturalist, woodsman, or farmer, and to anyone who has wondered about the name of a leafless tree in winter or been intrigued by an interestingly shaped fruit or seed.",

        "Description": "The follow-up to Ann B. Ross's beloved debut that kicked off the New York Times bestselling series. Look out for Ann Ross's newest,\u00a0Miss Julia Raises the Roof, coming April 2018 from Viking. \u00a0When Miss Julia burst on the scene in her fictional debut, Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind, this proper lady of a certain age found her orderly world turned upside down when Hazel Marie Puckett appeared with her nine-year-old son, Little Lloyd, who looked disturbingly similar to Miss Julia's late husband. Now, in Miss Julia Takes Over, with her sharp tongue and iron backbone intact, Miss Julia must tackle another disruption when Hazel Marie doesn't return from a dinner date with a fund-raiser who, in Miss Julia's opinion, wears his shorts too tight. Frantic and unable to persuade the local police that Hazel Marie is in danger, Miss Julia hires J. D. Pickens to investigate, despite her reservations about his taste for beer and women. She and Little Lloyd help search for Hazel Marie, running into adventures ranging from a most indelicate display of fisticuffs to a high-speed car chase on the track of a NASCAR Speedway, all the while standing strong ...because if Miss Julia doesn't take care of things, who will?Fast paced, funny, and full of colorful characters you'll want to meet again and again, Miss Julia Takes Over is a zany race through the South you'll not soon forget.",

        "Authors": "By Furst, Alan",
        "Description": "The Research of Alan Furst\u2019s Novels Alan Furst describes the area of his interest as \u201cnear history.\u201d His novels are set between 1933-the date of Adolf Hitler\u2019s ascent, with the first Stalinist purges in Moscow coming a year later-to 1945, which saw the end of the war in Europe. The history of this period is well documented. Furst uses books by journalists of the time, personal memoirs-some privately published-autobiographies (many of the prominent individuals of the period wrote them), war and political histories, and characteristic novels written during those years. \u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cthere is a lot more\u201d-for example, period newsreels, magazines, and newspapers, as well as films and music, especially swing and jazz. \u201cI buy old books,\u201d Furst says, \u201cand old maps, and I once bought, while living in Paris, the photo archive of a French stock house that served the newspapers of Paris during the Occupation, all the prints marked as cleared by the German censorship.\u201d In addition, Furst uses intelligence histories of the time, many of them by British writers. Alan Furst has lived for long periods in Paris and in the south of France. \u201cIn Europe,\u201d he says, \u201cthe past is still available. I remember a blue neon sign, in the eleventh arrondissement in Paris, that had possibly been there since the 1930s.\u201d He recalls that on the French holiday le jour des morts (All Saints\u2019 Day, November 1) it is customary for Parisians to go to the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. \u201cBefore the collapse of Polish communism, the Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s used to gather at the tomb of Maria Walewska. They would burn rows of votive candles and play Chopin on a portable stereo. It was always raining on that day, and a dozen or so Poles would stand there, under black umbrellas, with the music playing, as a kind of silent protest against the communist regime. The spirit of this action was history alive-as though the entire past of that country, conquered again and again, was being brought back to life.\u201d The heroes of Alan Furst\u2019s novels include a Bulgarian defector from the Soviet intelligence service, a foreign correspondent for Pravda, a Polish cartographer who works for the army general staff, a French producer of gangster films, and a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who works with a diplomat at the Hungarian legation in Paris. \u201cThese are characters in novels,\u201d Furst says, \u201cbut people like them existed; people like them were courageous people with ordinary lives and, when the moment came, they acted with bravery and determination. I simply make it possible for them to tell their stories.\u201d",

Critics have hailed his best-selling debut novel, TekWar, as being \"as tough and scrappy as Captain Kirk\" (The Wall Street Journal), praised TekLords for its \"fast-paced action, high-tech gloss\" (Library Journal), and called the author of TekLab \"a good writer\" of whom they \"await his next\" (Nashville Banner).In Tek Vengeance, investigator Jake Cardigan faces his most dangerous - and most heartbreaking - job ever. Beautiful Beth Kittridge, whom he has come to love more and more after rescuing her from the drug-dealing Teklords in TekWar, must go to Berlin to testify against one of the most dangerous Teklords of all. Jake wants to protect her - but he has a once-in-a-lifetime chance to obtain information from the dying daughter of a former Tek operative in Brazil. She'll talk only to Jake, and so he has no choice but to go, hoping to be back in time to travel with Beth. But as one thing after another seems to conspire to keep Jake and his sidekick, Gomez, busy in Brazil, he can't help but think he's been set up - and that Beth is in deadly danger.From Brazil to Berlin to Vienna, Jake and Gomez are off on a chase that may spell the end for the dealers in the vicious electronic drug Tek. This time Jake has the help of Dan, his son, who appears finally to believe that his father is one of the good guys, as well as that of the colorful cast of characters - human and robot - that fans of the world of Tek have come to expect.",

The other is Dr. Rivers himself, consumed by the medical challenge and moral dilemma of restoring men to health so that they can be sent back to the battlefields and almost certain death.Billy Prior is a working-class man on the rise, a \"temporary gentleman,\" who inhabits a sexual, social, and moral no-man's-land. His sexual encounters with both women and men are tinged with a cynical fatalism that the war has engendered. Still, he is eager to join a fellow Craiglockhart \"graduate,\" the poet Wilfred Owen, in France in time to participate in the great English offensive, the \"one last push\" intended to redeem all the shining heroism and senseless slaughter that has gone before.",

When Richard Paul Evans wrote The Christmas Box, he intended it as a private expression of love for his two young daughters, Jenna and Allyson. Though he often told them that he loved them, he didn't feel that they could ever really understand the depth of his feelings until they had experienced the joy of rearing their own children, and by that time their relationship would have changed forever. In writing The Christmas Box, he hoped that at some time in the future they would read the book and know of their father's love.  As Evans began to write, he was amazed at the inspiration that flowed into his mind and heart. He completed the moving story of a widow and the young family who comes to live with her in less than six weeks, and bound twenty copies to give as Christmas presents to family and friends. In the following weeks, those twenty copies were shared and passed along from family to family, from friend to friend, and what began as a tale for two little girls became a message of miracles, hope, and healing for people throughout the world.",
