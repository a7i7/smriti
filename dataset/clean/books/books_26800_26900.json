        "Description": "An invaluable guide for patients, their families and caregivers.    Parkinson's is a very common neurological disorder. Up to 1.5 million Americans are directly affected, including as many as 3% of the population over the age of 65. Five to 10% of Parkinson's sufferers develop symptoms in their prime, between the ages of 21 and 39.    This debilitating, progressive disorder of the central nervous system is caused by a loss in the brain of a hormone-like neurotransmitter called dopamine. Parkinson's five major symptoms include tremors, rigidity, slow movements (bradykinesia), gait disorder and loss of balance. Not surprisingly, the disorder has implications in all areas of a patient's life.    Parkinson's explores and explains the issues important to patients and families, including:  Diagnosis and treatment  Existing and new            drug therapies  The latest surgical procedures  Controlling symptoms and reducing the side effects of drug therapy  Adapting the home and managing daily life  Gene therapy and stem-cell research    Writing for patients and their families, Grimes presents the straight facts using detailed tables, sidebars and diagrams. The book presents the science and medicine behind the condition, and explains the jargon often used by doctors treating Parkinson's.",

Blood evidence has brought the authorities to his door. An eyewitness has placed him at the scene of the crime. And Madison has no alibi.Freeing himself from the closing jaws of justice isn't Madison's only struggle. The arrest has shaken the tenuous faith of his wife Leeza, his friends, and his colleagues. Even his attorney, facing overwhelming odds, has his doubts - until Madison's total disclosure leads to the gravest of suspicions: that Madison is not only the prime suspect in the brutal murder; he is also the prime target of a mysterious eyewitness, a seductive woman whose past has branded her a victim as well, and who has set in motion a chilling and malicious scheme. But to unveil her motives means exposing Madison's own startling secrets.As Madison's privileged world unravels, his last hope means crossing the precarious line between good and evil, right and wrong, guilt and innocence - by revealing a truth at the heart of a lie. And it could cost him more than he ever imagined. For Dr. Phillip Madison, justice has become the most dangerous ideal of all.",

A massive surge of economic refugees from poverty-stricken Eastern Europe and North Africa provokes a bloody reaction by nationalist extremists across Western Europe. A devastating global trade war that nobody can win threatens to escalate into a shooting war that everyone will lose.Now, a new, violently reconfigured Europe arises from the shattered debris of an Old Europe that could simply no longer exist. On one side stand France and Germany, united to create a single economic and military superpower stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals. Threatening to join their alliance is the former Soviet Union, poised on the brink of a neo-Stalinist takeover. On the other side, America and Britain link up with the new Eastern European democracies to deter the rise of a new tyranny even more menacing than the old USSR.In a matter of days, German and French armored units lock in ferocious battle against Polish-manned M1 tanks and America's rapid deployment forces. Massive dogfights swirl in the skies as F-15 Eagles duel for air superiority against high-tech Rafale jets. And the U.S. Navy fights for survival in the landlocked North Sea - menaced by German U-boats, mines, and nuclear-tipped French missiles.As much a compelling human drama as it is an epic saga of sweeping economic forces and clashing supermodern armies, Cauldron makes a new, terrifyingly uncertain world as real as only the best fiction can - and demonstrates once more why Larry Bond is the fastest rising military novelist today.",

For Dr. Geerat Vermeij's fingers are his eyes. One of the most accomplished evolutionary biologists of our time and the world's leading authority on an ancient \"arms race\" among mollusks, Dr. Vermeij is blind.No ordinary autobiography, Privileged Hands is the story of Dr. Vermeij's challenge and triumph. What makes his story so compelling is how he sees and what his insights reveal about the wonder of life on planet Earth. His exhaustive research of ancient and living mollusks, particularly shells, is extraordinary in its scope and perspective about how species arm themselves, compete, and survive. This is an intriguing irony for someone whose incomparable story is characterized by an unfailing determination to thrive in a sighted world and in the world of science. For Dr. Vermeij's self-portrait is also a portrait of the practice of science - his views on evolution and biodiversity, and the importance of observation are as much the story as are his family relationships, education, and position on affirmative action.",

Since his wife's death seven years ago, he has thrown himself completely into two things: taking care of his beloved young son and advancing his career. He has no time for love, and no patience for holiday joy.  But this Christmas  Galen's job for a major oil corporation has led him to the remote town of Point Hope, Alaska. The picturesque land of snow-covered mountains and caribou is a painful reminder of the day he gave up his faith. The white tundra, unchanged and untouched by all but the native Eskimos for thousands of years, means a lot to schoolteacher Ellie Springer. Originally from Dallas, Ellie came to Alaska looking for adventure and recovery from her last romantic disaster. But when Galen arrives, Ellie finds herself siding with some of the local villagers in a fight to keep Galen and his oil company out of their majestic town. Though many obstacles stand in their way, Galen and Ellie cannot help but feel an attraction between them.  But will their politics, their religion, and even the unforgiving winter weather keep them apart?Only a Christmas miracle can tell in this uplifting tale of love, second chances, and above all things, hope.",
