This revised edition includes new information pertinent to currenteducation and practice and addresses issues and concerns of great interest to students choosingamong different types of programs, schools, firms, and architectural career paths.Roger K. Lewis, apracticing architect and educator, takes a hard look at the education of the architect as he coverssuch topics as curriculum content, pedagogical theories and methods, program and faculty types, theadmission process, internship, compensation, computer-aided design, and the culture of small andlarge firms. He tells how an architect works and gets work, and explains all aspects ofarchitectural services, from initial client contact to construction oversight.The author describesthe benefits of becoming an architect, including the opportunity to express oneself creatively, toimprove the environment, and to achieve notoriety.

        "Description": "The rich have always been different from you and me, but this revealing and funny journey through \u201cRichistan\u201d entertainingly shows that they are more different than ever. Richistanis have 400-foot-yachts, 30,000-square-foot homes, house staffs of more than 100, and their own \u201carborists.\u201d They\u2019re also different from Old Money, and have torn down blue-blood institutions to build their own shining empire. Richistan is like the best travel writing, full of colorful and interesting stories providing insights into exotic locales. Robert Frank has been loitering on the docks of yacht marinas, pestering his way into charity balls, and schmoozing with real estate agents selling mega-houses to capture the story of the twenty-first century\u2019s nouveau riche:House-training the rich. People with new wealth have to be taught how to act like, well, proper rich people. Just in the nick of time, there\u2019s been a boom in the number of newly trained butlers\u2014\u201chousehold managers\u201d\u2014who will serve just the right cabernet when a Richistani\u2019s new buddies from Palm Beach stop by. \u201cMy boat is bigger than your boat.\u201d Only in Richistan would a 100-foot-boat be considered a dinghy. Personal pleasure craft have started to rival navy destroyers in size and speed. Richistan is also a place where friends make fun of those misers who buy the new girlfriend a mere Mercedes SLK.\u201cYou want my money? Prove that you\u2019re helping the needy!\u201d Richistanis are not only consuming like crazy, they\u2019re also shaking up the establishment\u2019s bureaucratic, slow-moving charity network, making lean, results-oriented philanthropy an important new driving force.Move over, Christian Coalition. Richistanis are more Democratic than Republican, \u201cfed up and not going to take it anymore,\u201d and willing to spend millions to get progressive-oriented politicians elected.\u201cMy name is Mike and I\u2019m rich.\u201d Think that money is the answer? Think again as Robert Frank explores the emotional complexities of wealth.And, as Robert Frank reveals, there is not one Richistan but three: Lower, Middle, and Upper, each of which has its own levels and distinctions of wealth \u2014the haves and the have-mores. The influence of Richistan and the Richistanis extends well beyond the almost ten million households that make up its population, as the nonstop quest for status and an insatiable demand for luxury goods reshapes the entire American economy.",

But just as important, in the 1980s it had come to be associated with weaknesses in foreign policy. Real men did not cite Grotius.\"As the era of totalitarianism recedes, the time is at hand to ask by what rules we expect to conduct ourselves, Senator Moynihan writes in this pellucid, and often ironic, examination of international law. Our founding fathers had a firm grasp on the importance and centrality of such law; later presidents affirmed it and tried to establish international institutions based on such high principles; but we lost our way in the fog of the cold war.Moynihan's exploration of American attitudes toward international law--those of presidents, senators, congressmen, public officials, and the public at large--reveals the abiding reverence for a law of nations and the attempts for almost two hundred years to make international law the centerpiece of foreign and strategic policy. Only in the last decade did a shift in values at the highest levels of government change the goals and conduct of the United States.Displaying a firm grasp of history, informed by senatorial insights and investigative data, elegantly written, this book is a triumph of scholarship, interpretation, and insight.",

But recent evidence gathered from archaeological ruins and a studied reappraisal of their achievements indicates that the Vikings were more than just a seafaring, warrior people. They practiced a disciplined and structured way of life, and were bound by a strict code of honor.Author A. G. Smith has chronicled the saga of these feared and fearless adventurers in this thoroughly researched coloring book. Thirty-eight realistically rendered drawings, including six double-page spreads, trace the exciting story of the Norsemen, whose daring explorations and warring ways profoundly affected European history from the eighth through the eleventh centuries.Here are vivid recreations of Viking life in Norway and Iceland; of raids in England and France; depictions of their presence in America (Vinland) and Russia; ship constructions, weapons, art, literature, mythology, agriculture, decisive battles, runes, and much more. An informative introduction outlines Viking history and ways of life, while descriptive captions for each illustration provide additional, fascinating information. Colorists will find Story of the Vikings Coloring Book offers hours of rewarding and educational coloring fun; artists and illustrators will appreciate the remarkable royalty-free illustrations, ideal for book and magazine illustrations and a host of other graphic purposes.",

My theory is this: Everything that strikes you as funny is going to turn up on television some day.I'll just give you this one example\u2014because it relates directly to the book you're reading.For as long as I can remember, I've always thought that the old idea of visualizing an audience naked, as a way to control nervousness, was a funny sort of notion. It just struck me funny.I mean, it's not one of those ideas that flits in and out of your mind. It sticks. And it asks for some kind of response.So, I made it the title of a book on presentations.I Can See You Naked.Need I tell you what happened next?The idea spread across the networks like a giggle through a classroom. Millions upon millions of people are howling their heads off about this quirky notion of speakers talking to naked audiences. It's hilarious. Dynamite. A TV writer's dream come true.Then, amidst the laughter, a question hit me: Had my book unleashed all of this hilarity?Surely not. But how many speakers would now visualize their next audience in a state of dishabille? I shuddered to think of it.If you're a presenter, a naked audience is not going to improve your concentration. Eye contact is going to be a real problem for you. And you're going to be very self-conscious about that $600 designer suit you're wearing.This was all dutifully explained in I Can See You Naked\u2014the first edition. But something told me it was time for new emphasis. Even with the relaxed morality that pervades our TV sets and movie screens, there remains a statement that must be resaid:Never speak to a naked audience. It can be distracting.There are all kinds of other psychological exercises that can be tapped to rid yourself of nervousness in the face of an awaiting audience. One woman even wrote to tell me that Chapter 13, which starts, \"It's the night before your big presentation\" enabled her to keep her sanity. Can you imagine? I considered changing the title of the book to reflect that thought, then decided that a promise of sanity was probably more that I could deliver\u2014times being what they are.As with the first edition, this expanded edition is dedicated to helping you be a better presenter. But it is also dedicated to candor, to saying things that\u2014for one reason or another\u2014never show up in other books on presentation.Who else would tell you \"to keep an eye out for the barracuda?\" (Chapter 51). Who else would tell you that \"you may have been in the wrong place at the wrong time?\" (Chapter 17). Who else would employ the Mafia to give you a pointer or two on presentations? (Chapter 31).In short, this is a very different book on presentations. It's even different from the first edition of I Can See You Naked, which still strikes me as a funny notion, great for sitcoms\u2014but now there are other things to laugh about, look at, learn from, and try as you get ready to make your next presentation.",

Even big kids, better known as adults, eagerly await that first cup of eggnog, savor the scent of a fresh-cut pine tree, and delight in the discovery of that perfect present for a hard-to-please relative. Christmas is a time of celebrating traditions-those that have been in the family for years, as well as those just recently embraced.Chicken Soup for the Soul Christmas Treasury for Kids will start a new holiday tradition for kids of all ages. With twenty-five true stories-one for each day in December through Christmas Day-this unique treasury will rekindle the Christmas spirit every December first and keep it burning in the hearts of readers throughout the holiday season. As kids and their loved ones read these stories together, they'll realize that the best traditions are those the whole family can share.Kids will read about the \"angels among us\" who give selflessly to those in need. They'll learn that sometimes the best gifts aren't bought at a store. They'll discover that giving to others can be more joyous than getting everything on their list. And both kids and adults will find these stories wonderful reminders of the true meaning of Christmas and make this book a cherished reading tradition for generations to come.",

        "Authors": "By Rosner, Elizabeth",
        "Description": "Every family has a story. Every story, eventually, must be told. For most of their lives, Julian Perel and his sister, Paula, lived in a house cast in silence, witnesses to a father struggling with a devastating secret too painful to share. Though their father took his demons to the grave, his past refuses to rest. As adults, brother and sister struggle to find their voices. A scientist governed by numbers and logic, Julian now lives an ordered life of routine and seclusion. My father gave up his language and his homeland. But he carried his sadness with him, under his skin. It was mine now. In contrast, Paula has entered the world as eagerly as Julian retracts from it. An aspiring opera singer, she is always moving, buoyant with sound. Singing was the only gift I could offer to my father. I filled the house with music. I tried to give him joy. . . .Yet both their lives begin to change on a Wednesday, miercoles, the day that sounds like miracles. Before embarking on a European opera tour, Paula asks her housekeeper, Sola, to stay at her place--and to look after Julian in the apartment above. Yet Sola, too, has a story. I want to clean myself like the window of a house, make myself clear for things to pass through. Flat and quiet. As Paula uncovers pieces of her father's early life in Budapest and the horrifying truth of his past, Julian bears witness to Sola's story--revelations that help all three learn how to both surrender and revere the shadows that have followed them for so long.The Speed of Light is a powerful debut about three unforgettable souls who overcome the tragedies of the past to reconnect with one another and the world around them. In an extraordinary accomplishment, Elizabeth Rosner has created a novel of love and redemption that proves the pain of the untold story is far greater than even the most difficult truth.",

Two weeks before Christmas, Diana Duprey, an outspoken abortion doctor, is found floating in her pool, a bruise the size of a golf ball visible through her dark curls. A national figure, Diana inspired passion and ignited tempers, never more so than on the day of her death.Her husband, Frank, an attorney in the D.A.\u2019s office for more than twenty years, had fought bitterly with her on the day of her murder. Yet to reveal the nature of their fight would cost him not only his career but something greater still\u2014a relationship he will go to any lengths to protect. Diana\u2019s daughter, Megan, a college freshman, had also quarreled with Diana that day, and her role in her mother\u2019s murder will prove more significant than she ever could have anticipated. The Reverend Stephen O\u2019Connell, founder of the town\u2019s pro-life coalition, obviously had issues with Diana, but his anger extended beyond the political to the personal\u2014namely, Dr. Duprey\u2019s involvement with his own troubled teenager.

His investigation implicates many in this town and reveals a series of gross miscalculations, each one challenging what we know, or think we know, about community, fidelity, justice, and love.

By intimately following the lives of nearly 300 inner-city workers and job seekers for two yearsin Harlem, Newman explores a side of poverty often ignored by media and politicians--the working poor.The working poor find dignity in earning a paycheck and shunning the welfare system, arguing that even low-paying jobs give order to their lives.

Far more than a brilliantly presented history lesson, this book represents a tour de force of coherent artistic vision.
