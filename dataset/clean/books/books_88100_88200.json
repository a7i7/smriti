        "Description": "An acute examination of a paradoxical U.S. president.John Adams was an undiplomatic diplomat and an impolitic politician--a fierce revolutionary yet a detached and reluctant leader of the nation he helped to found. Few American public figures have ever been more devoted to doing the right thing, or more contemptuous of doing the merely popular thing. Yet his Yankee-bred fixation with ethical propriety and fiscal conservatism never stood in the way of his doing what was necessary. Adams hated debt, but as minister to the Netherlands during the Revolution, he was America's premier junk-bond salesman. And though raised a traditional Massachusetts Congregationalist, Adams was instrumental in bringing about the consecration of the first American Episcopal bishops. He was a warm and magnanimous friend and, on occasion, a man who fully vindicated the famous judgment of a rival he detested. Adams, said Benjamin Franklin, \"means well for his country, is always an honest man, often a wise one, but, sometimes, and in some things, is absolutely out of his senses.\" James Grant examines this complex and often contradictory founding father in the most well-rounded and multi-faceted portrait of Adams to date. Going from his beginnings on a hardscrabble Massachusetts farm to the Continental Congress to the Court of St. James and the White House, Grant traces the words and deeds of one of our most learned but politically star-crossed leaders.",

        "Description": "What characterizes our era? Cults, quacks, gurus, irrational panics, moral confusion and an epidemic of mumbo-jumbo, that's what. In How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World, Francis Wheen brilliantly laments the extraordinary rise of superstition, relativism and emotional hysteria. From Middle Eastern fundamentalism to the rise of lotteries, astrology to mysticism, poststructuralism to the Third Way, Wheen shows that there has been a pervasive erosion ofEnlightenment values, which have been displaced by nonsense. And no country has a more vivid parade of the bogus and bizarre than the one founded to embody Enlightenment values: the USA. In turn comic, indignant, outraged, and just plain baffled by the idiocy of it all, How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World is a masterful depiction of the absurdity of our times and a plea that we might just think a little more and believe a little less.",

        "Title": "Word Spy: The Word Lover's Guide to Modern Culture",
        "Authors": "By McFedries, Paul",
        "Description": "Language wears many hats, but its most important job is to help us name or describe what's in the world.  Words define us, our actions, even our existence.  And just when you think that you have all the words you need, you discover new ones, hear new uses for old ones or see them mutate right before your eyes\u2014a neologism is born.Those neologisms are actually one of the best ways of keeping tabs on the way our world and culture are changing.  One of the people who's been keeping tabs is Paul McFedries, the president of Logophilia Limited (logophilia is Greek for \"the love of words\"). His scorecard is Word Spy, a daily newsletter that has been reporting from the neological frontier since 1998 and that has more than 100,000 visitors a month and more than 12 million page views. In Word Spy, McFedries demonstrates how new words both reflect and illuminate not only the subcultures that coin them but also the larger culture in which these groups exist.  Neologisms give us insight into the way things are even as they act as linguistic harbingers of what's to come.  Each chapter of Word Spy is a cultural snapshot, a slice of the zeitgeist that focuses on a specific idea or sociological phenomenon, with an emphasis on the words and phrases that it has generated.  These snapshots cover various aspects of modern life, including relationships, business, technology, war, aging, multiculturalism, and even fast food, all the while introducing us to hybrid words:  If your kids can't seem to get away from their computers, they may be addicted to \"fritterware\" (time-wasting game software).  If you're a new mother with a passion for petitioning, you may be a \"lactivist\" (breast-feeding activist).  And if you keep finding yourself staying way later at the office than you ever imagined, you may be suffering from \"presenteeism.\"  Word Spy is an exciting and informative travelogue through the evolving landscape of our language and, consequently, the cultures and subcultures that continually mold and shape not just the language but all of us who speak it.",

        "Authors": "By Oates, Joyce Carol",
        "Description": "A New York Times Notable Book and a former Oprah Book Club\u00ae selection  Moving away from the dark tone of her more recent masterpieces, Joyce Carol Oates turns the tale of a family struggling to cope with its fall from grace into a deeply moving and unforgettable account of the vigor of hope and the power of love to prevail over suffering. The Mulvaneys of High Point Farm in Mt. Ephraim, New York, are a large and fortunate clan, blessed with good looks, abundant charisma, and boundless promise. But over the twenty-five year span of this ambitious novel, the Mulvaneys will slide, almost imperceptibly at first, from the pinnacle of happiness, transformed by the vagaries of fate into a scattered collection of lost and lonely souls. It is the youngest son, Judd, now an adult, who attempts to piece together the fragments of the Mulvaneys' former glory, seeking to uncover and understand the secret violation that occasioned the family's tragic downfall. Each of the Mulvaneys endures some form of exile--physical or spiritual--but in the end they find a way to bridge the chasms that have opened up among them, reuniting in the spirit of love and healing. Profoundly cathartic, Oates' acclaimed novel unfolds as if, in the darkness of the human spirit, she has come upon a source of light at its core. Rarely has a writer made such a startling and inspiring statement about the value of hope and compassion.",

Born during the Great Famine of the early 1960s and raised in the slums of Chongqing, Hong Ying was constantly aware of hunger and the sacrifices required to survive. As she neared her eighteenth birthday, she became determined to unravel the secrets that left her an outsider in her own family. At the same time, a history teacher at her school began to awaken her sense of justice and her emerging womanhood. Hong Ying's wrenching coming-of-age would teach her the price of taking a stand and show her the toll of totalitarianism, poverty, and estrangement on her family. With raw intensity and fearless honesty, Daughter of the River follows China's trajectory through one woman's life, from the Great Famine through the Cultural Revolution to Tiananmen Square.",

        "Description": "Could you forgive the murderer of your husband? Your mother? Your son?Families of murder victims are often ardent and very public supporters of the death penalty. But the people whose stories appear in this book have chosen instead to forgive their loved ones\u2019 murderers, and many have developed personal relationships with the killers and have even worked to save their lives. They have formed a nationwide group, Murder Victims\u2019 Families for Reconciliation (MVFR), to oppose the death penalty.MVFR members are often treated as either saints or lunatics, but the truth is that they are neither. They are ordinary people who have responded to an extraordinary and devastating tragedy with courage and faith, choosing reconciliation over retribution, healing over hatred. Believing that the death penalty is a form of social violence that only repeats and perpetuates the violence that claimed their loved one\u2019s lives, they hold out the hope of redemption even for those who have committed the most hideous crimes.Weaving third-person narrative with wrenching first-hand accounts, King presents the stories of ten MVFR members. Each is a heartrending tale of grief, soul searching, and of the challenge to choose forgiveness instead of revenge. These stories, which King sets in the context of the national discussion over the death penalty debate and restorative versus retributive justice, will appeal not only to those who oppose the death penalty, but also to those who strive to understand how people can forgive the seemingly unforgivable.",

        "Description": "Spanning nearly one hundred years of American political history, and abounding with outsize characters--from Lindbergh to Goldwater to Gingrich to Abramoff-- White Protestant Nation  offers a penetrating look at the origins, evolution, and triumph (at times) of modern conservatism. Lichtman is both a professor of political history at American University and a veteran journalist, and after ten years of prodigious research, he has produced what may be the definitive history of the modern conservative movement in America. He brings to life a gallery of dynamic right-wing personalities, from luminaries such as Strom Thurmond, Phyllis Schlafly, and Bill Kristol to indispensable inside operators like financiers Frank Gannett and J. Howard Pew. He explodes the conventional wisdom that modern conservative politics began with Goldwater and instead traces the roots of today\u2019s movement to the 1920s. And he lays bare the tactics that conservatives have used for generations to put their slant on policy and culture; to choke the growth of the liberal state; and to build the most powerful media, fundraising, and intellectual network in the history of representative government.  White Protestant Nation  is entertaining, provocative, enlightening, and essential reading for anyone who cares about modern American politics and its history.",

Now, Sir Victor's son Oliver has selected representative samples to illustrate the tremendous scope of his father's brilliance. Included in this volume are sections of Pritchett's memoirs, A Cab at the Door and Midnight Oil; his reflections on turning eighty; and an account of a visit to the Appalachians written in 1925. There are also portraits of Dublin, New York, the Amazon, and Spain; selections from the novels Dead Man Leading and Mr. Beluncle; thirteen complete short stories; excerpts from biographies of Turgenev and Chekhov; and critical pieces on Twain, Scott, Dickens, Eliot, Henry James, Tolstoy, Saul Bellow, Salman Rushdie, and others.\"Pritchett has lived as a man of letters must, by his pen, and he has done it with a freshness of interest and an infectious curiosity that have never waned,\" observed novelist Margaret Drabble.

But are they indeed so? 1,000 Common Delusions debunks these persistent myths. From the stories of the ancient world to religion and sports, here are the real facts about common fallacies that have long been assumed to be true. Organized by theme -- history and politics, natural sciences and technology, society and everyday life, Earth and the universe, and others -- here are some examples:  Delusion. Stone Age humans lived in caves. Truth. They lived in huts and tents. The caves, decorated with hunting scenes and animal pictures, were used for ritual ceremonies.  Delusion. Geishas are always female. Truth. They are professional entertainers, and the first ones were exclusively            male.  Delusion. Marie-Antoinette told her subjects to eat cake. Truth. When Marie-Antoinette was still a child, a fictional princess in a story said, \"If they have no bread, let them eat brioches.\" Later this was attributed to Marie-Antoinette.  Delusion. A frightened ostrich will bury its head in the sand. Truth. An ostrich lays its head on the ground to detect vibrations. If its young are threatened, however, it will play dead and draw in its neck.  Delusion. The Hundred Years War lasted 100 years. Truth. The clash between France and England actually lasted 114 years, from 1339 till 1453.  Delusion. Bagpipes were invented in Scotland. Truth. They were introduced into the British Isles by Caesar's legionnaires and originated in Asia             Minor.    The myth-shattering truths in this intriguing book will shock, surprise and amuse readers. Fully indexed, it is a welcome resource -- and sure to be the final arbiter in many disagreements.",

Historian and journalist Norman Moss looks at this transfer of global rule from the point of view of the changing \"special relationship\" of the U.S. and Britain, with the U.S. taking on something like the imperial role that Britain had previously held. Although some had predicted this transfer of roles, few were ready for it whenit happened.At a time when America's diplomatic role in the world is coming increasingly under scrutiny,Picking Up the Reins looks at the U.S.'s assumption and acceptance of the role of superpower, and its evolution from being an opponent of the concept of empire, to a defender and ultimately an inheritor of the imperial role.",

        "Title": "The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?",
        "Authors": "By Esposito, John L.",
        "Description": "Are Islam and the West on an inevitable collision course?  Are Islamic fundamentalists medieval fanatics--a threat to stability in the Muslim world and to American interests in the region?  Does a clash of world views loom on the horizon?  From the Ayatollah Khomeini to Saddam Hussein, the image of Islam as a militant, expansionist, and rabidly anti-American religion has gripped the minds of Western governments and the media.  But these questions and perceptions, John Esposito writes, stem from a long history of mutual distrust, criticism, and condemnation--and they are far too simplistic to help us understand one of the most important issues of our times.     In The Islamic Threat, Esposito places the challenge of Islam in critical perspective, exploring the vitality of Islam as a global force and the history of its relations with the western world.  He offers a systematic assessment of Islamic politics in several key nations (including Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia, and Algeria) and in particular Islamic movements (from moderates to radicals), demonstrating the diversity of the Islamic resurgence--and the mistakes western analysts make in assuming a hostile, monolithic Islam.  Esposito examines the potential challenge or threat of Islam in light of the Rushdie affair, the Gulf War of 1990-91, the New World Order, and the pressure for democratization in the Muslim world.  He goes on to explore the issues facing Islam and the West in the 1990s, such as pluralism, human rights, the status of women and minorities in the context of Islamic revivalism.     John Esposito is one of the foremost authorities on the Islamic world, widely acclaimed in both Muslim nations and the West.  His most recent work, Islam: The Straight Path, was praised as \"lucid and comprehensive\" (Washington Post Book World) and \"probably the best one-volume introduction\" (Voice Literary Supplement).  In this incisive and important new study, he throws fresh light on one of the most critical issues in world politics today.",

        "Description": "When gold rush fever gripped the globe in 1849, thousands of Chinese immigrants came through San Francisco seeking fortune. InThe Poker Bride, Christopher Corbett uses a little-known Idaho legend as a lens into this Chinese experience. Before 1849, the Chinese in the United States were little more than curiosities. But as word spread of the discovery of gold, they soon became a regular sight in the American West. In San Francisco, a labyrinthine Chinatown arose where Chinese smuggled into the country were deposited. Polly, a young Chinese concubine, accompanied her owner to a mining camp in the highlands of Idaho. After he lost her in a poker game, Polly found her way with her new owner to an isolated ranch on the banks of the Salmon River. As the gold rush receded, it took with it the Chinese miners, but left behind Polly, who would make headlines when she emerged from the Idaho hills nearly half a century later to visit a modern city and tell her story. The Poker Bride vividly reconstructs a lost period of history when the first Chinese sojourners flooded into the country and left only glimmering traces of their presence scattered across the American West.",

        "Description": "Historical atlases offer an understanding of the past that is invaluable to historians, not only because they convey a previous age's sense of space and distance but also because they reveal what historians and educators of those periods thought important to include or omit. This book?the first comprehensive and wide-ranging account of the historical atlas?explores the role, development, and nature of this important reference and discusses its impact on the presentation of the past.Jeremy Black begins with a consideration of the \"pre-history\" of the historical atlas: individual maps depicting the Holy Land at the time of Christ and maps of the classical world. He then examines the first known historical atlas, the Parergon of Abraham Ortel, which was published in Antwerp in 1579 and was followed by other works that mapped the world of the Bible and the classics. In the eighteenth century, there was a growing interest in mapping the post-Classical world, and works appeared that included maps of medieval Europe. In the nineteenth century, historical maps came increasingly to embody a clear political emphasis, mapping blocs of territory separated by clear linear frontiers and reflecting an approach to the past focused on undivided sovereignty and the development of the nation-state.In the twentieth century, historical atlases have both contributed to and responded to other ideologies, portraying peoples, languages, and cultural differences in an immediate and often striking visual form. Since 1945 the range of atlases has broadened to include maps devoted to the global environment, health, population trends, and other sociological, cultural, and economic changes. And the \"liberation\" of the Third World and the ending of the Cold War have stimulated a full scale re-mapping of the globe and the way it is perceived.",

How much influence do these bloggers have? Is there any kind of censorship or quality control? Are booksellers aware of them? Does Oprah Winfrey take note?Many people develop a real fondness for book bloggers who write reviews for love and not money. Taking in small, quirky Web sites like Book Slut, dovegreyreader, Bluestalking Reader, and MoorishGirl as well as large, well-known sites like salon.com, this book will show readers how to investigate literature from distant lands, to find the sites of authors who are yet to be discovered by the mainstream, and to find the pages of book industry pundits who have opened their daily lives to a wider world. Welcome to the honest world of book blogs. Catheryn Kilgarriff and Rebecca Gillieron are editors at Marion Boyars Publishers, and Meryl Zegarek is a book publicist of many years standing.

Responding to recent works that question Left Behind's biblical accuracy, two respected theologians set forth solid, biblical answers in this reader-friendly resource. Beginning with a clear presentation of prophecy interpretation and dispensationalism, the authors examine specific end times events represented in Left Behind and offer historical and biblical support for each event.Story Behind the BookWith the incredible success of this series, we believe that it would be beneficial to the body of Christ for someone to publish a book that gives solid, thoughtful, biblical answers to the critics of the Left Behind theology. With the questions that are being raised and will continue to be raised, many may begin to wonder if the Left Behind theology is really biblical. Some of the impact of the series could be undermined. This book would set forth substantive biblical points in favor of the various end times events presented in the series.",
