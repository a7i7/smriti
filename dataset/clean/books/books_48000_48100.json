George Bernard Shaw described her as having \"no conscience, no conviction \u2026 she remains mean, envious, insolent, cruel, in protest against others' happiness.\" Her feeling of anger and jealousy toward a former schoolmate and her ruthless manipulation of her husband and an earlier admirer lead her down a destructive path that ends abruptly with her own tragic demise.Presented in this handsome, inexpensive edition, Hedda Gabler offers an unforgettable experience for any lover of great drama or fine literature. Among the most performed and studied of Ibsen's dramas, it continues to provoke and challenge audiences and readers all over the world.",

He loses his faith, and becomes an encyclopedia salesman and a motion-picture addict. The remainder of Clarence's family moves to the small town of Basingstoke, Delaware, where his cautious son, Teddy, becomes a mailman. Faithless himself, Teddy marries a good Methodist girl and begets Esther, whose prayers are always answered; she becomes an object of worship, a twentieth-century goddess. Her neglected son, Clark, makes his way back to the fiery fundamentals of Protestant piety. The novel ends in 1990, in Lower Branch, Colorado, and on television.Taking its title from the \"Battle-Hymn of the Republic,\" In the Beauty of the Lilies spins one saga, one wandering tapestry thread, of the American Century.",

        "Description": "Sara Stein is nuts about animals. Over the years she's raised a monkey, a coyote, and a horned toad, and she came within a heartbeat of taking home a wallaby. In this mammoth pet encyclopedia she identifies dozens of unusual and not-so-unusual critters that make great pets in the house, in the yard, and in the wild. Stein even suggests temporary pets kids can bring home to observe overnight and return to their natural habitat the next morning. Stein's recommendations suit every domestic situation. Skunks, for example, work well in an apartment. A big backyard is ideal for keeping a goat or two. If parents don't want a pet running through the house, tarantulas are happy in a nice glass vivarium. And if indoor pets are out of the question, Stein explains how to befriend the pigeons in the park or the rabbits in the yard. For all her enthusiasm, Stein takes a common-sense approach to pets. Each entry discusses diet, housing, special problems, life span, and just how tame you can expect the pet to become. She also tells you whom to call if you wind up with a sick snake or an angry parrot. Stein devotes an entire chapter to which type of vivarium, aquarium, serpentarium, cage, or hutch is best suited to which creature. She even explains how to build an inexpensive-but-comfortable habitat. Whether you like them furry, slithery, slimy, or scaly; whether you want one that swims, crawls, leaps, flies, or hardly moves at all, you'll find a pet in this book suited to every family's taste.",

Cambridge School Shakespeare approaches the plays in a new way, encouraging students to participate actively in examining them, to work in groups as well as individually, to treat each play as a script to be re-created, and to explore the theatrical/dramatic qualities of the text. The editorial comments cater for pupils of all ages and abilities, providing clear, helpful guidelines for school study.

        "Title": "Breaking the Deadlock: The 2000 Election, the Constitution, and the Courts",
        "Authors": "By Posner, Richard A.",
        "Description": "The 2000 Presidential election ended in a collision of history, law, and the courts. It produced a deadlock that dragged out the result for over a month, and consequences--real and imagined--that promise to drag on for years. In the first in-depth study of the election and its litigious aftermath, Judge Posner surveys the history and theory of American electoral law and practice, analyzes which Presidential candidate ''really'' won the popular vote in Florida, surveys the litigation that ensued, evaluates the courts, the lawyers, and the commentators, and ends with a blueprint for reforming our Presidential electoral practices.The book starts with an overview of the electoral process, including its history and guiding theories. It looks next at the Florida election itself, exploring which candidate ''really'' won and whether this is even a meaningful question. The focus then shifts to the complex litigation, both state and federal, provoked by the photo finish. On the basis of the pragmatic jurisprudence that Judge Posner has articulated and defended in his previous writings, this book offers an alternative justification for the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore while praising the Court for averting the chaotic consequences of an unresolved deadlock.Posner also evaluates the performance of the lawyers who conducted the post-election litigation and of the academics who commented on the unfolding drama. He argues that neither Gore's nor Bush's lawyers blundered seriously, but that the reaction of the legal professoriat to the litigation exposed serious flaws in the academic practice of constitutional law. While rejecting such radical moves as abolishing the Electoral College or creating a national ballot, Posner concludes with a detailed plan of feasible reforms designed to avoid a repetition of the 2000 election fiasco.Lawyers, political scientists, pundits, and politicians are waiting to hear what Judge Posner has to say. But this book is written for and will be welcomed by all who were riveted by the recent crisis of presidential succession.",

Dr. Martin Belvedere, a pioneer in the field, recognized her unique talent for what he calls Level Five lucid dreaming. It's satisfying, lucrative work, but it can be emotionally draining. Especially when one of her anonymous subjects, known only as Client Number Two, captures her imagination through his compelling dream narratives. Secretly, she thinks of him as \"Dream Man.\"  His real name is Ellis Cutler. A loner who's learned not to let anyone get too close, he works for a highly classified government agency with an interest in the potential value of lucid dreaming. And he's just been ordered by his boss to make contact with Isabel, who's been fired after the sudden death of Dr. Belvedere. Heading to California, he pushes his fantasies out of his mind, determined to maintain a professional relationship with the woman who reads his dreams, the mysterious figure he has come to think of as \"Tango Dancer.\"  But when they meet in the flesh, the dream becomes real enough to touch. And a waking nightmare begins-when a suspicious hit-and-run leads them into a perilous web of passion, betrayal, and murder, and forces them to walk the razor-thin line between dreams and reality.",

Here is an exciting way to teach them America's system of justice. Susan Kuklin, whose nonfiction books for young readers have won many awards, gives readers the inside story of a dynamic contemporary court case and uses exclusive interviews with all the participants to explain what happened. Kuklin had unparalleled access to the prosecution, the defense, the judge, and even, after the case, the jury in a dramatic case involving a kidnapping ring in New York's Chinatown. First, the prosecution describes a plot in which hard men try to take advantage of defenseless immigrants, beat them and extort thousands of dollars from their impoverished families. Then the defense takes us behind the scenes of the shadowy deals struck in jail where criminals might turn on anyone to bargain for lighter sentences.  In intimate interviews, Kuklin learns what motivates the tough Korean-immigrant prosecutor and the die-hard liberal defense attorney and uses every explosive courtroom exchange to clearly explain legal concepts such as hearsay evidence, leading witnesses, presumption of innocence and admissability of evidence.  With every twist and turn of the judge's rulings, readers will be on the edge of their seats, wondering who will win the case while simultaneously becoming their own legal experts. This engaging story of the law at work provides a hands-on way to learn about our courts and laws for young readers who stage mock trials at school or watch cases on TV.",

Now, in her latest thriller, she takes us on a terrifying manhunt for a serial killer no ordinary cops can stop\u2013a psychopath who seems to step out of a living nightmare.He\u2019s the kind of killer we instinctively fear the most. A killer without boundaries, without conscience, without any fear of being caught. And his latest victim is terrifying proof that no one is safe: the daughter of a powerful U.S. senator.Now, with the national media calling for justice and a grief-stricken father seeking vengeance, Bishop and his FBI Special Crimes Unit find themselves in a unique situation. This time even psychic cops aren\u2019t enough to stop evil. Aid comes in the form of a fledgling civilian organization of unorthodox crime stoppers. Operating outside of any government oversight, without sanction or official authority, they are comprised of a membership every bit as talented and eccentric as Bishop\u2019s SCU\u2013if not more so. And that is no coincidence. For Bishop helped launch this organization barely two years before.Dani Justice knows all about monsters. They haunt her nightmares\u2013and her life. But she never expected to find herself doggedly on the trail of a real flesh-and-blood predator so cunning, he\u2019s eluded the best law enforcement could send up against him; so deadly, he doesn\u2019t hesitate to kill even a senator\u2019s daughter. Or a cop.  Dani doesn\u2019t want to hunt this killer. She doesn\u2019t want to risk the life she\u2019s made for herself, or her hard-won peace.  But she doesn\u2019t have a choice.  Because his bloody rampage has hit far too close to home.  Because Dani alone commands a weapon powerful enough to destroy him.      And because Dani knows something even Bishop doesn\u2019t.  Dani knows how the hunt ends. It ends in fire. And blood. And death.  What she doesn\u2019t know is who will survive.",
