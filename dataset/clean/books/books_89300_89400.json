        "Title": "Psychology: A Modular Approach to Mind and Behavior (Available Titles CengageNOW)",
        "Authors": "By Coon, Dennis",
        "Description": "Over 2 million students have learned psychology from Dennis Coon. Serving as a guide and mentor to students, Coon uses humor and everyday analogies to make abstract concepts concrete, such as \"the cerebral cortex looks like a giant, wrinkled walnut.\" Using a consistent pedagogical structure, the author helps students learn psychology by using the tested principles of Survey, Question, Read, Recite and Review. In addition, he helps them to master psychology with a fourth \"R,\" Relate, which requires them to relate their new knowledge to their own experience, helping abstract ideas to become concrete. The book uses a \"chunking\" principle, asking students to read major sections, then review them, before they go on. As the new title of the book indicates, PSYCHOLOGY: A MODULAR APPROACH TO MIND AND BEHAVIOR (formerly called ESSENTIALS OF PSYCHOLOGY) is now modular, and is the medium-sized text in a three-book set authored by Dennis Coon. By separating the chapters into modules, this edition goes even further in \"chunking\" content for student mastery. This text covers the basic set of topics but differs by having two chapters on development, a separate chapter on \"Gender and Sexuality\" (Chapter 15), and a concluding chapter on \"Applied Psychology\" (Chapter 17). The book is frequently described as \"fun\" because it presents topics that are of interest and relevance to students, relates it to their lives, and provides many engaging applications that students can use in their own lives. For teachers who want a book that students will read, enjoy, and savor - Coon's text is the perfect choice.",

        "Description": "The Bible presents great themes that are universally relevant for the faith formation of all human beings in all times and places.\u00a0 As we reflect upon faith issues in our daily lives, we can engage these themes to learn more about God and what it means to live a life of faith.\u00a0 Christ: Jesus' Life, Teaching, and Ministry draws from the gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke as guides for exploring Jesus' life, what he taught, and how he cared for others. In this study we learn more clearly what it means to live in God's kingdom now and in the future as Jesus understood and taught. The book offers the following sessions:Session 1, \"Power To Lead\" explores Jesus' baptism, temptation, and miracles and the implications for how God prepares us for leadership.(Mark 1:4-13; 2:1-12)Session 2, \u201cThe Prevailing Good\u201d recounts the trials, crucifixion, and Resurrection of Jesus, and what these events teach us about the cost and rewards of faithfulness. (Mark 14:53-65; 15:1-5; and 16:1-8)Session 3, \"Experiencing True Joy\" how living our lives according to Jesus' teachings about the ways of God's kingdom will lead to true happiness and faithful living. (Matthew 5:1-16; Matthew 6:1-18)Session 4, \"Jesus as Storyteller\" shows how Jesus' use of parables can help us understand and practice God's ways in our daily lives. (Matthew 13:1-23; Matthew 18:21-35)Session 5, \"Living Our Faith\" explores how our lives are judged by our deeds of love and mercy.(Matthew 25:31-46)Session 6, \"A Ministry of Compassion\" examines ways Jesus demonstrated that the good neighbor is one who reaches across all boundaries to show mercy to others. (Luke 4:14-30; Luke 8:40-56; Luke 10:25-37)Session 7, \"Humility and Hospitality\" explores Jesus' teachings about humility and hospitality, key features of life lived according to the ways of God's kingdom.

        "Description": "The U.S. economy is wrapping up twenty-five years of some of the strongest, smoothest growth in its history-a performance so sweet economists have given it a name: ?the Great Moderation.\u201d So why have so many of us, even those making hundreds of thousands of dollars, arrived at the new century with a gnawing sense that events are moving against our families and ourselves? The easy answer is that we\u2019re suffering a case of needless anxiety. But the easy answer is wrong. Drawing on interviews with hundreds of Americans and new statistics he developed, Peter Gosselin traces a quarter-century shift of economic risk from the broad shoulders of business and government to the backs of working people. It is a shift that has shaken the pillars of most families\u2019 lives-stable jobs, solid benefits, government protections. The change doesn\u2019t mean one can\u2019t prosper. But it does mean the benefits of growth come at greater peril and your financial fall will be steeper if you stumble. This threat to working Americans\u2019 security-and what to do about it-is a pressing concern to economists, policy-makers, and everyone who works for a living.",

        "Description": "That last raise may be fattening your bank account, but it did nothing for your soul. The talk you had with your boss about your kids' schools, however, did. Although our culture is focused on achievement, it is not our accomplishments that sustain us. It is the connections we make along the way.  What are these connections? They are the feelings of being part of something that matters, something larger than ourselves, whether it is a friendship, marriage, team, company, or even a set of ideals. They can enrich your life, and their absence can shorten it. They are the key to what counts in life, and they are becoming harder and harder to make.  Now a noted psychiatrist outlines the steps we can take to make or reaffirm the connections that nourish the hungry heart. Through his own life experiences and those who have shared their stories with him, we learn of the great joy and peace that come from connecting, and the consequences of remaining detached. And we learn how to nurture that part of us which is so often neglected, and so very crucial to our emotional, psychological, and physical well-being -- our connections.",

        "Description": "A leading international economist looks at many of the key issues of trade policy now confronting the United States and the world in this timely book. Clear, informative, and witty, Jagdish Bhagwati provides the best available analysis of the protection debate and offers a prescription for reform in this turbulent area of trade policy. Bhagwati identifies new and powerful interests and ideologies that are likely to dominate the outcome of the debate. He argues that opposing tendencies can be identified in trade-related ideologies and in the national and sectional interests that lobby on trade policy in pluralistic societies. He offers the prognosis that the forces favoring freer trade are more robust and more fundamental than the forces of protectionism, and that pro trade forces are likely to triumph in the end but only if we adapt appropriately the institutions within which these ideologies and interests must function. Through an appealing combination of text, quotations, cartoons, tables, charts, and graphs, Bhagwati provides a masterly and entertaining look at the forces for and against protection.Protectionism is based on the inaugural series of Ohlin Lectures, which he delivered at the Stockholm School of Economics in October of 1987.",

The book provides an integrative framework that embraces both the essential similarities and the fundamental differences among the psychotherapies.  The authors explore each system's theory of personality, theory of psychopathology, resulting therapeutic process and relationship. By doing so, Prochaska and Norcross demonstrate how much psychotherapy systems agree on the processes producing change while disagreeing on the content that needs to be changed. The limitations, practicalities, and outcome research of each psychotherapy are also presented to bring both the similarities and differences to life, the authors demonstrate how the same complex psychotherapy case (Mrs. C) is formulated and treated by each system.",

From the Ayatollah Khomeini to Saddam Hussein, the image of Islam as a militant, expansionist, and rabidly anti-American religion has gripped the minds of Western governments and media. But these perceptions, John L. Esposito writes, stem from a long history of mutual distrust, criticism, and condemnation, and are far too simplistic to help us understand one of the most important political issues of our time. In this new edition of The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?, Esposito places the challenge of Islam in critical perspective. Exploring the vitality of this religion as a global force and the history of its relations with the West, Esposito demonstrates the diversity of the Islamic resurgence--and the mistakes our analysts make in assuming a hostile, monolithic Islam. This third edition has been expanded to include new material on current affairs in Turkey, Afghanistan, Palestine, and Southeast Asia, as well as a discussion of international terrorism.",

        "Description": "Can you be trusted with free speech? Many politicians in Washington don't think so. They see your right to free speech as a threat to their seat in power. In this hard-hitting book, bestselling author Brad O'Leary exposes the frightening movement afoot that would eviscerate the First Amendment. With his trademark, take-no-prisoners approach, O'Leary shows you how censorship is on the march. From the Orwellian Fairness Doctrine to so-called campaign finance reform, you will learn the real threats, who the enemies of Ben Franklin and Thomas Paine are (including names of senators, congressmen, and Obama administration officials), what they're up to, and how you can fight back and save your freedom. Over two decades ago, Ronald Reagan gave birth to a flourishing, free exchange of ideas when his Federal Communications Commission removed the shackles of the misnamed Fairness Doctrine and restored the First Amendment. However, what was a boon to honest debate has proven to be a nightmare for left-wing politicians. Now these censorship proponents have the upper hand and the First Amendment in their sights.",

        "Description": "While Adobe Photoshop has long been their choice for editing digital photographs, many photographers want a more focused tool. That\u2019s where Adobe Photoshop Lightroom comes in. Designed from the ground up with digital photographers in mind, Photoshop Lightroom offers powerful editing features in a streamlined interface that lets photographers import, sort, and organize images. This completely updated and expanded bestseller, The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 Book, was also written with photographers in mind. Author Martin Evening describes features in Photoshop Lightroom 2 in detail from a photographer\u2019s perspective. As an established commercial and fashion photographer, Martin knows first-hand what photographers need for an efficient workflow. He has also been working with Lightroom from the beginning, monitoring the product\u2019s development and providing feedback on the public beta. As a result, Martin knows the software inside and out, from image selection to image editing to image management.  The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 Book contains 624 pages of comprehensive and detailed coverage of all aspects of Lightroom. In this book you\u2019ll learn how to: \u2022 Work efficiently with images shot in the raw or JPEG format\u2022 Import photographs with ease and sort them according to your workflow\u2022 Create and manage a personal image library\u2022 Apply tonal adjustments to multiple images quickly\u2022 Integrate Photoshop Lightroom with Adobe Photoshop\u2022 Export images for print or Web as digital contact sheets or personal portfolios The book structure has been organized to match a typical Lightroom workflow. The introductory chapter provides an overview of all the main Lightroom features, showing how Lightroom 2 was used on a studio photo shoot that was specially shot to illustrate the book. The following chapters cover all the essentials, such as importing photos, working with the Library module, and managing the catalog database. The biggest section of the book is devoted to working with the Develop module and provides some unique insights into working with new features such as the localized adjustment tools. There is also a whole chapter devoted to image sharpening and another on integrating Lightroom and Photoshop, where you will learn how to devise the best workflow methods for working between these two programs. This is followed by a chapter on printing and a presentation chapter on the Slideshow and Web modules. Lastly, there are two appendix chapters. One offers a complete overview of the Lightroom 2 preference settings, while the other provides some in-depth explanations and background reading on how the Lightroom program works. The book is richly illustrated, mostly using the author\u2019s own photographs, and one of the nice features of this book is the way enlarged panel views are used throughout, making it easier for readers to follow the settings used in the various step-by-step examples. There are also lots of tips that will help you take your Lightroom techniques to an advanced level. If you are looking for the most comprehensive coverage of Lightroom, written by an author who is closely involved with the development of the program, this is the book to get.

        "Description": "While there are people who actually embrace getting older (although we confess not to know any) most try to deny it. Rita Rudner is no exception. When she reached 50, she couldn't even bear to admit it: \"It was more comfortable getting a laugh and telling people I was filthy than having to say the word fffiffffty,\" she writes. In her hysterically dead-on bookI Still Have It...I Just Can't Remember Where I Put It, she relates her absurd adventures as a woman of a certain age navigating the strange and terrifyingly funny world of \"near-sighted insights.\"In chapters such as \"Artificially Hip\"; \"Older Than Springtime, Younger Than Angela Lansbury\"; \"I Won't Blog, Don't Ask Me\"; and \"The Advantage of Vintage,\" Rudner tackles body issues, style, and technology, and looks at the wonders and surprises of life on the dark side of 50. So put on your bifocals and get ready to laugh. Just don\u2019t blame Rita if your laugh lines become visibly deeper.\"Sexy deadpan is comedian Rita Rudner's trademark style, never more in evidence than inI Still Have It ... I Just Can't Remember Where I Put It ... Pure vaudeville, a kick at any age.\"\u2014O, The Oprah Magazine",
