        "Title": "The Catholic Catechism: A Contemporary Catechism of the Teachings of the Catholic Church",
        "Authors": "By Hardon, John A.",
        "Description": "\"This volume is intended to meet a widely felt need for an up-to-date and concise source book on the principal teachings of the Catholic Church. Since the close of the Second Vatican Council, there has been such an accumulation of ecclesiastical constitutions and decrees and so many changes they introduced in Catholic practice that few people have been able to keep up with all that has happened... A parallel purpose of this volume is to offer those who use it a handy guidebook of the Catholic tradition, whether formally documented in ecclesiastical sources or implicitly accepted by the faithful under the aegis of the Church's hierarchial leaders.\"The method followed in presenting the Church's doctrine is a combination of history and logic. Doctrines are placed into a historical framework by tracing their origins to the Old and New Testaments and placing their development within the context of persons, places, and times. The doctrine thus becomes more intelligible because it is viewed in the setting of its vital growth over the centuries.\"The intended reading audience of this Catholic catechism are all those priests, religious and laity, and above all parents and teachers, who are looking for a concise statement of the faith they profess, the conduct they practice, and the worship they give to the Lord.\"--From The Catholic Catechism by John A. Hardon, S.J.",

        "Description": "Covering human development in eleven stages (from pregnancy and prenatal development through old age to death), Newman and Newman discuss physical, intellectual, emotional, and social development, addressing themes of continuity and change at each of the life stages. The text contrasts internal (self-directed) and external influences on growth, change, and continuity, and presents the whole person, with extensive consideration given to the family and social environment as important factors in shaping development. Throughout, the authors encourage readers to explore personal questions about development within a framework of scientific knowledge, with particular emphasis on Erik Eriksons model of psychosocial development..Psychosocial theory (used in this text as a guide to organizing information, not as dogma) proposes that cognitive, emotional, and social growth are the result of the interaction between the societal expectations of the individual at each life stage and the competency of the individual to meet each life challenge. A psychosocial crisis is a predictable life tension resulting from the conflict people experience between their own competence and the expectations of society. The psychosocial theoretical framework for studying human development makes Newman and Newman uniquely suited for courses in which social development, family, and environment are considered important in the study of human development.",

A recent war between the United States and China has thinned the population and brought social chaos. The dollar has been locally replaced by Massachusetts scrip; instead of taxes, one pays protection money to competing racketeers. Nevertheless, Ben's life, traced by his journal entries over the course of a year, retains many of its accustomed comforts, as supervised by his vibrant wife, Gloria. He plays golf; he pays visits to his five children and ten grandchildren. Something of a science buff, he finds his personal history caught up in the disjunctions and vagaries of the \"many-worlds\u00a0\u00a0hypothesis derived from the indeterminacy of quantum theory. His identity branches into variants extending back through history and ahead in the evolution of the universe, as both it and his own mortal, nature-enshrouded existence move toward the end of time.",

        "Description": "From the author of the internationally bestselling literary sensation An Instance of the Fingerpost comes Death and Restoration, the sixth in Iain Pears' much-loved Jonathan Argyll art-mystery novels.  The monastery of San Giovanni on Rome's Aventine Hill has no real treasures, except for one huge and disturbing painting, dubiously attributed to Caravaggio, of the breaking of Saint Catherine on the wheel. It's not a subject likely to appeal to many buyers of stolen art. But a Caravaggio is a Caravaggio -- or is it?  Following a recent burglary at the monastery's chapel, there's little left to steal, so Flavia di Stefano of Rome's Art Theft Squad is particularly puzzled when she receives a tip that thieves plan to raid the building. What is there, except perhaps the Caravaggio, that professionals could covet? Even stranger is the sudden arrival in Italy of Mary Verney, an Englishwoman and thief whom Flavia and her art-expert fianc\u00e9, Jonathan Argyll, have encountered before. She may be there as a tourist, but it's unlikely. Is Mary after personal riches, or is her trip, and her possible involvement in a theft, inspired by more terrifying circumstances?  Jonathan also wonders about the intentions of Daniel Menzies, the \"Rottweiler of Restoration,\" who is restoring the supposed Caravaggio in the disused monastery chapel where even the candles in front of a nearby icon of the Virgin and Child, long venerated by the local population for its special protection of those who offered prayers, have been extinguished.  Something strange and threatening is occurring both inside and outside the monastery, and Jonathan and Flavia feel powerless when they fail either to stop a theft or a murder. As the two search for answers through the maze of monastic and police bureaucracy, they gradually reveal a surprise more shocking than even they had imagined.  Rome is ancient and full of secrets, some of which never should be revealed, and Iain Pears is at the peak of his powers in this exquisitely rendered crime novel in which the Roman setting plays as memorable a role as any of the players.",

She is essentially alone in the world, separated from her husband, rarely seeing her policeman brother. Perhaps a child would fill the void.There's only one problem: who should father the baby? Not her husband, whom she dislikes. Not someone from a new relationship. That might mean messy complications. So Laura goes to a bar and picks up a man for a one-night sexual encounter.After the baby is born, Laura doesn't see the father again until she stares in horror one day at a familiar face in the newspaper. It's the man from the bar. The newspaper story tells Laura that she's made a terrible mistake, one that she and her little son, Tom, will have to live with forever.Twenty years later, Laura owns a small television production studio offering on-camera coaching to publicity-hungry politicians and businessmen. It's not exciting work, but it pays for a good education for Tom, a rather introverted young man without many friends. Laura is relieved when he brings home a girlfriend, Emily Howard. Perhaps Emily and Tom can look to the future together as a happy young couple.Laura and those she loves cannot escape the past, however, a past that encompasses Tom's sordid conception and Laura's own troubled early years. When a murder occurs, a circle of evil seems to have been completed. Does evil run in families? Is there a bad gene? Laura may learn the tragic answer as she fights to save her own life and the life of her child.",

        "Description": "For more than a year, Christopher Darden argued passionately and tirelessly, giving voice to the victims in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. But few people knew that he was fighting a deeper, more insidious battle - against racism that came from all sides. When the case was over and O. J. Simpson was set free, the disheartened prosecutor bore the anguish and disillusionment of millions of Americans. He also carried wounds that perhaps no other black person has ever felt as deeply. Now, out of the sensational frenzy of the \"trial of the century\" comes a haunting and poignant memoir of duty, justice, and the constant, powerful undertow of American bigotry.Christopher Darden's In Contempt is an unflinching look at a justice system kidnapped by a racist cop, shameless defense lawyers, a starstruck judge, and a dysfunctional jury. It shows what the television cameras couldn't: behind-the-scenes meetings where Darden tried to determine whether detective Mark Fuhrman was telling the truth about his racist views; deteriorating relationships between the defense and prosecution teams, with taunting, baiting, and a pushing match between Darden and Simpson; and a judge who let the case get out of control while he collected hourglasses from fans and invited celebrities into his chambers.Darden is stunningly candid about his own performance - including the brash decision to put the gloves on Simpson - and details the inner workings of the largest prosecution team in California history. He also recounts the strong relationship forged between himself and Marcia Clark, who was exhausted by the pressures of a bitter ex-husband and demeaning treatment from other lawyers and the judge.",

Maybe the fresh start would improve the relationship between Blake and their learning-disabled son, Sammy, giving their crumbling marriage one last chance. But before they can resolve the tensions between them, Blake leaves for a military assignment in Europe.Alone with Sammy in their new home, Carol delves into her restoration, fired by a dream of opening a bed-and-breakfast, \"The Christmas Inn.\" As she recovers long-lost blueprints and research the mansion's history, she learns it was once home to a storybook couple - and a shocking murder....Piece by piece, Carol uncovers the glittering lives - and shattering tragedy - of Charles and Veronica. But the more questions she asks, the more hostile the townspeople become. Soon she discovers secrets within the house itself: hints of a forbidden desire, a terrible jealousy, and a woman's lies. In the face of terrifying anonymous threats - and fearing for Sammy's safety - Carol makes solving the murder her personal quest. But as her world and Veronica's begin to blur together, she spirals closer to the shocking truth - a discovery that someone in her small town would kill to keep hidden.",

In late summer, Katie escaped from a Shawnee village on the banks of the Ohio, and followed the rivers through the wilderness to find her way home - a brave journey that ended in sorrow.Jeremy, a city-bred graduate student with no trail experience, is determined to complete his scholarly quest, unaware that his journey will be both a trial of hardships and a mystical experience. He does not know that the spirit of Katie Wyler is still seen wandering the hills, trying to get home. Mountain wise woman Nora Bonesteel sees her every autumn \"when the air is crisp and the light is slanted and the birds are still.\"Hiram Sorley, known as Harm, is also at large in the Appalachian wilderness. Sorely, who has escaped from the Northeast Correctional Center in Mountain City, Tennessee, is the focus of a wide-spread manhunt involving most of the area's law enforcement officers. There's just one problem: nobody wants him caught. Harm has become a folk hero.Sheriff Spencer Arrowood feels sorry for Harm, imprisoned for life for killing a hated local bureaucrat. There is even some doubt about Harm's guilt. Besides, the elderly convict has Korsakoff's syndrome, a disease that robs its sufferers of their recent memories. To Harm, it is always 1967. Harm doesn't even remember the crime. For Martha Ayers, who wants the job of deputy, catching Harm Sorely would be the best way to prove her fitness for the position.Harm, an Appalachian Don Quixote on the edge of reality, meets both Jeremy and the still-wandering Katie Wyler on his journey back to a home that isn't there anymore. He is the \"last moonshiner,\" holding the dream of an unspoiled wilderness in the fragile web of his delusions. When he goes, it will be lost forever.",

After centuries of desperate exploration, the People have found only one planet that can sustain them: Venus.

It was the 1960s and integration was becoming the law, but it wasn't the reality. There were still \"colored only\" doors and drinking fountains, whites-only schools and libraries. Warren wasn't allowed to take holy Communion at the \"white\" church. Martha's closest girlfriend abandoned her when, at college, Martha befriended a black man.Both Warren and Martha were \"affirmative action hires\" at The Washington Post in the early 1970s. They worked together for more than twenty years; becoming friends as they shared the ups and downs of life. Then Warren became sick with kidney disease. A kidney donated to him by his wife failed. He was on the verge of death when Martha, informed she was also a blood type match, donated her kidney to her friend.Warren and Martha chronicled their experiences surrounding the surgery in a series of articles written for the Post. To them, it was a simple story of friendship, a successful operation, and a happy ending. But the extraordinary popular reaction to their articles, especially among blacks, revealed that their story was something more: it was a success story about integration.Now, in Black & White & Red All Over, the friends tell the whole tale: of their childhoods in the segregated South, of their meeting and deepening friendship, of Warren's brush with death, and Martha's decision to help save his life. This book chronicles the intersection of two lives that, but for the changes in American society of the last half-century, would never have occurred.",

        "Description": "Here's the Real Deal! The same Washington politicians who took control of Congress by promising to balance the federal budget are now bankrupting America by launching the biggest spending spree in the history of the United States.With big-spending Democrats at their side, President George Bush and his \"conservative\" Republican Congress have controlled the government's checkbook while the national debt has skyrocketed past seven trillion dollars. That's right, $7,000,000,000,000. How has the party of Reagan become the party of big- government spending?Now former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough delivers a scathing indictment of Republicans and Democrats alike in the same informed, hard-hitting, and entertaining style fans of Scarborough Country have come to admire. Having had a ringside seat during his four terms in the House of Representatives, Scarborough gives the inside scoop on how Washington really works and on the spending orgy the Republicans have fueled the last ten years.The story begins with Newt Gingrich's Contract with America and the Republicans promising to balance the budget and reform Washington. It culminates with a Republican president continually rubber-stamping pork-filled appropriations bills that squander taxpayer dollars. That is, unless you think it's necessary to spend millions of dollars on research into \"alternative salmon products\" in Alaska, or the study of crickets in Utah, or of sea turtles in Hawaii.\u00a0Sadly, these instances merely hint at the gross spending by Congress.",

        "Authors": "By Pietrzyk, Leslie",
        "Description": "Fifteen-year-old Alice dreams of her first kiss, goes to sleepovers, makes prank calls, auditions for Our Town, and tries to pass high school biology. It's 1975, and at first look her life would seem to be normal ... and unexceptional. But in the world that \"genuine and fully developed talent\" (Washington Post) Leslie Pietrzyk paints, every moment she chronicles is revealed through the kaleidoscope of loss, stained by the fact that Alice's mother, Annette, without warning, apology, explanation, or note, deliberately parks her car on the railroad tracks, in the path of an oncoming train.In the emotional year that follows, Alice and her older brother find themselves in the care of their great-aunt, forced to cope and move forward after their catastrophic loss. Lonely and confused, Alice absorbs herself in her mother's familiar rituals, trying to recapture their connection -- only to be stunned by the sound of her mother's voice speaking to her clear as day as she flips Sunday-morning pancakes. Driven to understand who her mother was, Alice distances herself from her girlfriends and brother as she engages in \"conversations\" with Annette. As Alice works through her grief, she slowly begins to see Annette as an individual -- separate from simply \"my mother\" -- and ultimately embraces the bittersweet knowledge that the lives to which we are most intimately connected often remain the most mysterious of all.Taking its title from the pop-psychology idea that it should only take a year to get over the death of a loved one, A Year and a Day is an intense and deeply affecting portrait of how the human heart counters tragedy and can spin hard-won triumph out of the deepest despair. A redemptive, often humorous meditation on growing up and growing into oneself, this is an intimate and heartwarming novel to curl up with and savor.",

Now she ratchets up the tension with Murder List, in which evil is on the hunt\u2013 and proves to be methodically organized and chillingly successful.When Chicago detective Alec Buchanan is offered a prime position with the FBI, it is the perfect opportunity to leave the Windy City and follow in his brothers\u2019 footsteps to the top echelons of law enforcement. But first he must complete one last assignment (and one that he is not too happy about): acting as a glorified bodyguard to hotel heiress Regan Hamilton Madison. The gorgeous exec has become entangled in some potentially deadly business. Someone has e-mailed her a graphic crime-scene photo\u2013and the victim is no stranger.Regan suspects that the trouble started when she agreed to help a journalist friend expose a shady self-help guru who preys on lonely, vulnerable women. In fact, the smooth-as-an-oil-slick Dr. Lawrence Shields may be responsible for the death of one of his devotees, which was ruled a suicide. Hoping to find some damning evidence, Regan attends a Shields seminar.At the gathering, the doctor persuades his guests to partake in an innocent little \u201ccleansing\u201d exercise. He asks them to make a list of the people who have hurt or deceived them over the years, posing the question: Would your world be a better place if these people ceased to exist? Treating the exercise as a game, Regan plays along. After ten minutes, Shields instructs the participants to bring their sheets of paper to the fireplace and throw them into the flames. But Regan misses this part of the program when she exits the room to take a call\u2013and barely escapes a menacing individual in the parking lot.The experience is all but forgotten\u2013until the first person on Regan\u2019s list turns up dead. Shock turns to horror when other bodies from the list start to surface, as a harrowing tango of desire and death is set into motion. Now brutal murders seem to stalk her every move\u2013and a growing attraction to Alec may compromise her safety, while stirring up tender emotions she thought she could no longer feel. Yet as the danger intensifies and a serial killer circles ever closer, Regan must discover who has turned her private revenge fantasies into grisly reality.",

When his reefwife discovers that a mission fleet has targeted their homeworld for conversion, his comfortable lifestyle vanishes in an instant.Servant-of-Unity XIV Samuel has cheerfully devoted his life to the grand wonder that is Cosmic Unity, and all he desires is to help spread its message of universal harmony to a grateful galaxy. But Samuel's awe turns to horror when he uncovers Cosmic Unity's darkest truth.At its core, Cosmic Unity is a lovely, seductively gentle religion stating that all creatures - whether born of flesh, silicon, superconducting gases, or magnetic plasma - are equal and deserve tolerance. Yet over 22,500 years and spread by a vast hierarchy, the simple concept has mutated into a malignant and violent memeplex - heretics will not be tolerated.Bereft of faith and rebelling against the Ecclesiarchs, Samuel is shattered and confused when he stumbles upon Second-Best Sailor, fleeing from his threatened home to a potential new habitat. Flung together by fate and supported by the Neanderthals' host of traders, Second-Best Sailor and Samuel plot a kamikaze plan to fight off the invaders. Along the way, they will need the help of the unlikeliest and most fascinating of allies.But can they bring down an idea that has destroyed everything across tens of thousands of light-years?",

        "Description": "In 1951 Barney Rosset acquired Grove Press and proceeded to build it into one of the most controversial and influential houses of the era, publishing Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, D. H. Lawrence, Octavio Paz, Jorge Luis Borges, the Marquis de Sade, Frantz Fanon, and many others. For nearly three decades, readers sought out and read books because they were Grove books. In celebration of the past half-century, Grove Press is now offering a collection of the seminal writers it has published over the past fifty years. The reader opens with an introductory overview by noted Beckett scholar S. E. Gontarski, which recounts Grove Press's early days as a small upstart house, the battles against censorship, the halcyon years and the less profitable times, the attacks by militant feminists and Cuban emigres, and the merger with Atlantic Monthly Press. The book includes selections of works by authors from William Burroughs to Will Self, Jean Genet to Dennis Cooper, Marguerite Duras to Jeannette Winterson, and Samuel Beckett to Tom Stoppard. There are letters between editors and authors, as well as retrospective essays by Grove's key publishers and editors. Organized chronologically, The Grove Press Reader is both an anthology of excellent writing and a commemoration of a spirit of independent publishing that has flourished for fifty years and will continue to thrive in the new century.",

Its pages took her back to a critical year in the tumultuous, treacherous passages of adolescence - the time, in Carol Gilligan's words, \"when girls are in danger of drowning or disappearing.\"Israeloff didn't drown that year - her grades didn't plummet, she didn't seriously rebel - nor did she disappear. But the metamorphosis she underwent was no less profound for being a quiet one. The ambitious, athletic, competitive \"tomboy\" who loved math and science was transformed into an introverted, tentative young woman who had discovered the love of words that would make her a writer but had lost the bold, unconstrained voice of her childhood.With her journal entries as a point of entry, Israeloff relives that watershed year and the turnings it marked in her sexual, emotional, and intellectual identity. Reaching back in time and forward to her present as a writer, wife, and mother, she has woven a searching account of the bittersweet realities of growing up female, one that will resonate with women of all ages.",

China is also a significant recipient of foreign aid and a major borrower on international capital markets. Even more significantly, it is attracting vast amounts of foreign direct investment.China in the World Economy examines the implications of China's emergence as a major player in the world economy. Its integration into the international economic order poses major difficulties for the rest of the world. These problems including bringing China's mixed market/centrally planned economy into the GATT, adapting to competition from labor-intensive Chinese exports, encouraging further market-oriented reform, and accommodating its demand for international capital. But China's participation in the global economy also offers important opportunities for trade, investment and international cooperation to promote world peace and stability.Nicholas Lardy anticipates that China will continue on a rapid growth path, thus magnifying the policy challenges and opportunities for its trading partners, including the U. S. He recommends a series of steps to facilitate China's full participation in the world economy.",

        "Description": "At a time when Colin Powell is being discussed as a possible vice-presidential candidate for the Republican party, a growing segment of the population is asking whether racial prejudice has lost its power. But not so fast: In this startling, sharply insightful, and eye-opening book, Ellis Cose trains his practiced eye on the murky waters of race in America and looks at the acute differences, even hostility, in our perceptions of race exposed by the 0. J. Simpson trial, not to mention the controversial content of The Bell Curve. In doing so he addresses whether it is possible for the United States to simply wipe the racial slate clean and surmount its racist past, or if color blindness may be just another name for denial.In a world where it is often believed that lighter skin means higher status, money is the great equalizer, and education will set you free, Color-Blind brilliantly reveals why race may be a larger-and smaller-issue than many people think. With the keen observational powers of a professional journalist and the concrete solutions of a true visionary, Ellis Cose delivers his most powerful and important book to date.",
