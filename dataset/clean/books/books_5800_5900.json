        "Authors": "By Cook, Robin",
        "Description": "From the master of the medical thriller comes a heart-stopping tale of intrigue and mystery set at the uncertain juncture of medical care and financial pragmatism; a story that reads like today's headlines.Fatal Cure is a hair-raising, timely foray into the dark side of medical reform, proving that with \"managed care\" the unthinkable can be as close as the local hospital.Doctors Angela and David Wilson believe they have found personal and professional bliss when they opt to leave the university medical center for Bartlet Community Hospital, a modern, state-of-the-art medical facility in scenic Bartlet, Vermont. For Angela, a pathologist, and David, an internist/primary-care physician, Bartlet seems to be a dream come true: a town with green lawns and crystal lakes that is an idyllic haven from urban crime and pollution; a chance for a home of their own and a resurgence of romance in their relationship; a perfect environment for their eight-year-old daughter, Nikki, who suffers from cystic fibrosis; and the opportunity to work within an enlightened system of \"managed care.\"But all is not what it seems. After a resplendent fall, a stark landscape looms in Bartlet that reveals more than the skeletons of the trees. Gradually at first and then at a quickening pace, the Wilsons' earthly Nirvana disintegrates as mysterious, unexplained deaths become more than coincidences. The deadly nightmare of their life threatens them all, even Nikki, the most vulnerable. Fighting for their careers as well as for the very survival of their family, Angela and David must conquer the evil that confronts each of them before they are consumed by the horror.Mystery thriller and romance, a story rich in medical lore, Fatal Cure is Robin Cook at his probing, timely, page-turning best.",

And now the Mother of All Comedy Shows has given birth to the Mother of All Comedy Books.The best, most killer comedy routines from the first ten years of Comic Relief are gathered together here in one hysterical volume. You'll find Billy, Whoopi, and Robin, of course - also such favorites as Garry Shandling, Dennis Miller, and Bill Maher; Paula Poundstone, Elayne Boosler, and Rita Rudner; Louie Anderson, Steven Wright, Bob Saget, Sinbad, and many, many others...a stellar lineup of stand-up.",

Helping your children develop values such as honesty, self-reliance, and dependability is as important a part of their education as teaching them to read or how to cross the street safely. The values you teach your children are their best protection from the influences of peer pressure and the temptations of consumer culture. With their own values clearly defined, your children can make their own decisions -- rather than imitate their friends or the latest fashions. In Teaching Your Children Values Linda and Richard Eyre present a practical, proven, month-by-month program of games, family ctivities, and value-building ecercises for kids of all ages.",

In these pieces, first written for Newsweek and The New York Times, Loud and Clear takes on topics ranging from social change to raising children, from the political and emotional aftermath of September 11 to personal values, from the impact on individuals of global events to the growth that can be gained by spending summer days staring into the middle distance. Grounding the public in the private, connecting people to each other and to the greater world, Quindlen encourages us to develop authentic lives, even as she serves as a catalyst for political and social change.\u201cAnna Quindlen\u2019s beat is life, and she\u2019s one hell of a terrific reporter,\u201d said Susan Isaacs, and Quindlen\u2019s unique qualities of understanding and discernment, everywhere evident in her previous bestsellers, including A Short Guide to a Happy Life and Living Out Loud, can be found on every page of this provocative and inspiring book.",

Interpreting macroeconomics as a zero-sum game, Thurow proposes that the American economy will not solve its most trenchant problems-inflation, slow economic growth, the environment-until the political economy can support, in theory and in practice, the idea that certain members of society will have to bear the brunt of taxation and other government-sponsored economic actions. As relevant today as it was twenty years ago, The Zero-Sum Society offers a classic set of recommendations about the best way to balance government stewardship of the economy and the free-market aspirations of upwardly mobile Americans.",

And with the third disappearance, the sleepy little town awakens to a full-blown nightmare.In The Church of Dead Girls, Stephen Dobyns probes the ruinous effects of suspicion. No one is immune, not the respected editor of the local paper, nor the demure cashier at the pharmacy, nor even the narrator, a high school biology teacher, observed baking cookies with young girls and helping them with their homework. As the panic mounts and the citizens take the law into their own hands, old rumors, old angers, and old hungers come to the surface to reveal the secret history of this seemingly genteel town and the dark impulses of its inhabitants.Written with an uncanny awareness of the intricacies of human nature, The Church of Dead Girls is both a gripping story about the corrosive effects of fear and a chilling psychological thriller.",

Writing with the warmth and authenticity that have become her trademarks, Viorst once again demonstrates her uncanny ability to transform our daily realities into poems that make us laugh with recognition. Whether her subject is the decline of the body (\"It's hard to be devil-may-care/When there are pleats in your derri\u00e8re\") or future aspirations (\"Before I go, I'd like to have high cheekbones./I'd like to talk less like New Jersey, and more like Claire Bloom\"), she always speaks directly to our condition.

Its subject, the long struggle of the Crees of James Bay in northern Quebec\u2014a hunting and trapping people\u2014to defend the territories they have occupied since time immemorial, came to international attention in 1972 when they tried by legal action to stop the immense hydro-electric project the provincial government was proposing to build around them. The Crees argued that the integrity of their vast wilderness was essential to their way of life, but the authorities dismissed such claims out of hand. Richardson, who sat through many months of the trial, mingles the scientific and Cree testimony given in court with his own interviews of Cree hunters, and experiences in gathering information and shooting films, to produce a classic tale of cultures in collision.In a new preface, he reveals that the Crees\u2014now receiving immense sums of money as compensation for the loss of their lands\u2014appear to be doing well, and to be in the process of joining modern, technological culture, while retaining the spiritual base of their traditional lives. Meanwhile, Hydro-Quebec continues to eye additional rivers on the Cree\u2019s lands for new dams.",

Shouldn\u2019t we sacrifice some rights to make us all safer? And if we can kill a combatant in battle, why shouldn\u2019t we torture them if it will save lives? William Schulz, Executive Director of Amnesty International USA, examines these and other fundamental questions through the prism of our new consciousness about terrorism in this provocative new book. It questions America\u2019s own ambivalent record?its tainted legacy?and addresses recent human rights violations: the imprisonment without charge of non-citizens and the violation of the Geneva Convention at Guantanamo Bay. Schulz writes, ?One of Osama bin Laden\u2019s goals is to destroy the solidarity of the international community and undermine the norms and standards that have sustained that community since the end of World War II. The great irony of the post-9/11 world is that, when it comes to human rights, the United States has been doing his work for him.\u201d",

The convergence of the two impulses forms what Williamson calls a \"holistic politics.\"With the publication of The Healing of America, Williamson becomes a powerful voice for social conscience in American society. While citing the virtual abandonment of social justice as a dominant political theme since the 1960's, Williamson notes historian Arthur Schlesinger's contention that Americans express renewed political interest every thirty years. This is a time, according to Williamson, for Americans to return once again to our first principles -- political and spiritual. In this landmark work, Williamson draws plans for the transformation of American political consciousness and the reemergence of powerful citizen involvement in a genuine healing of American society.",

But what Ben really liked was hiking and camping-and when he joined the local Scout troop Applebome reluctantly went along for the ride.   As someone who had never made a fire except in a gas grill and tied knots only in his shoelaces, Applebome was an unlikely recruit. Taking us from the low points to the unexpected triumphs and through all the trekorees and derbies in between, Applebome hikes the trail from tenderfoot skeptic to proud Scout dad. Offering affectionate portraits of the motley group of boys in the troop, he also laces his very funny narrative with an informal but fascinating history of Scouting and grapples with the modern-day controversies that will help determine Scouting's future.",

His closing remarks, like an exclamation point after each broadcast, may illuminate the week's events or they may range widely through the oft-puzzling human condition - but they're always worth waiting for.In this one-of-a-kind book, we get the undiluted Brinkley. He marvels at government regulations that require paint cans to bear a label reading \"Do not drink paint.\" He nominates Richard Nixon as Official U.S. Government Scapegoat. He commiserates with an Oklahoma mayor who must earn extra money by collecting beer cans and claiming the deposits. He reminisces about a White House that welcomed casual picnickers on its lawn. He forgives George Bush for passing out in Tokyo. He observes that \"if we can put a man on the moon, we could put Congress in orbit.\" He skewers lawyers, bureaucrats, Washington insiders, hypocrites of all stripes. He commemorates absurdity - and hence suffers fools gladly.",

He and his reporters transformed it into one of the most influential and respected news publications in the world, reinvented modern investigative journalism, and redefined the way news is reported, published, and read. Under his direction, the paper won eighteen Pulitzer prizes. His leadership and investigative drive following the break-in at the Democratic National Committee led to the downfall of a president, and kept every president afterward on his toes.Bradlee, backed every step of the way by the Graham family, challenged the federal government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers - and won. His ingenuity, and the spirited reporting of Sally Quinn, now his wife, led to the creation of the Style Section, a revolutionary newspaper feature in its time, now copied by just about every paper in the country.",

        "Description": "November. in a bleak month, a bleak Richard Jury takes an aimless ride on one of London's icons--the old double-decker bus, a # 14 traveling the Fulham Road. His attention is caught by a woman \"with hair so gossamer-pale you could see the moon through it,\" wearing a fur coat, boarding his bus in front of a pub called the Stargazey. Her behavior intrigues him, as she leaves, reboards, and leaves the bus again. Jury follows her to the gates of Fulham Palace--but only to the gates. There he stops. Later he wonders if the death in the walled garden of Fulham Palace could have been averted if he had gone in...nd if this precipitated still another death in a London club named Boring's, which is Melrose Plant's crusty old men's club. Before Jury and Plant work out the connection between these killings, they are both helped and hindered by Martha Grimes' usual band of eccentrics: Theo Wrenn Browne, trying to shut down the Long Pidd library; the Cripps family trying to shut down civilization; and Diane Demorney, the new horoscope columnist for the Sidbury Star, trying to shut down the heavens.",
