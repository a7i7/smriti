        "Authors": "By Hamilton, Adam and Gadsden, Cynthia",
        "Description": "The pastor of one of today\u2019s most dynamic churches illumines the basic principles of attracting the unchurched to the Christian message.Using the story of Bob, a successful swimsuit salesman whose business takes a turn for the worse when he moves to Alaska, Adam Hamilton reminds us that all of life is about sales. Whether we are in a job interview, a candidates\u2019 debate, or a classroom, we are selling something: our skills, our convictions, our selves. The same is true of presenting the gospel to the unchurched. In leading a friend to a saving relationship with Christ, in inviting them to join us at church, we are presenting them with something that we believe they need, that will make all the difference in their life. Yet if we don\u2019t understand what we are presenting, who we are presenting it to, if we don\u2019t believe in the message we are offering, or if we don\u2019t believe that people need that message more than anything else, then we will not be faithful witnesses to it. In short, says Hamilton, if we don\u2019t understand some of the most basic principles that all successful salespersons know, then we will not succeed in presenting the message of Christ to those who most need to hear it. By telling the humorous and quirky story of Bob trying to sell swimsuits in the Arctic, Hamilton explains the fundamental concepts of sales that also apply in how we spread the gospel message. Drawing on his experience as the leader of one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing churches, he offers pastors and other Christian leaders solid, simple guidance on how to share the faith, and grow one\u2019s congregation.",

It was also the last battle the \"Father of Modern Warfare\" would leave in absolute triumph, for, though he did not know it, Austerlitz marked the beginning of Napoleon's downfall. His triumph was too complete and his conquest too brutal to last. Like Hitler, he came to believe he was invincible, that no force could halt his bloody march across Europe. Like Hitler, he paid dearly for his hubris, climaxing in bitter defeat at Waterloo in 1815. In a matter of years, he had fallen from grace. Alistair Horne explores the theme of military success and failure inHow Far From Austerlitz? He chronicles Napoleon's rise and fall, drawing parallels with other great leaders of the modern era.",

Any number of factors might account for this trend, but almost every observer would agree that what Lyle Schaller calls the \"contagious disease of intradenominational quarreling\" has played a large role. Schaller says that the day has arrived to focus on the cure to this disease. Recognizing that the most difficult step in this process will be to gain agreement on what are the non-negotiable issues in the disagreements that divide United Methodists, Schaller has recruited a number of individuals from around the denomination to comment on what is really \"at risk\" in The United Methodist Church. Only by undertaking the hard work of gaining agreement on what the real issues are that divide United Methodists, he says, will it be possible to hope for a way forward.",

        "Description": "Beadwork, the last of the traditional crafts to be discovered by fine artists, has undergone a revolution in the past two decades. Creative men and women, interested in its unique qualities of color, light reflection, refraction, and texture, are exploring its rich possibilities for fine detail and spectacular pattern. Kathlyn Moss, an important beadwork artist, and Alice Scherer, founder and director of the Center for the Study of Beadwork in Portland, Oregon, provide a survey of the best recent work in the medium. Their choices range from traditional wall hangings and jewelry to highly original and experimental pieces, including narrative sculptures, game boards, vessels, installation pieces, and wearable art.Dozens of full-color illustrations, photographed especially for this volume, present work of remarkable scope and variety. They are accompanied by detailed commentaries, often in the words of the artists themselves. The introductory essay traces the history of modern beadwork and examines the relationship between the beadwork of traditional cultures and the innovative work being done today.The book offers a wealth of reference materials. One appendix details the history and manufacture worldwide of seed beads, the basic unit of beadwork, a second describes the principal techniques, with and without a bead loom. Clear, easy-to-follow diagrams, created especially for this volume, explain each technique. Additionally, the authors have assembled a glossary of important beadwork terms, a listing of recent exhibitions of beadwork, a selected bibliography, and listings of addresses for principal bead societies, research institutions, and suppliers. Thus the book is both a full-color presentation of the finest recent work in this burgeoning art form and an indispensable reference for the artist and collector.",

At least one thing has changed since high school: She now has a very sweet but frequently challenging son named Noah, who attends the same tony private LA school she herself attended. Rickie fit in fine when she was a student, but now her age and tattoos make her stand out from all the blond Stepford moms, who are desperate to know why someone so young-and so unmarried-has a kid in first grade.  Already on the defensive, Rickie goes into full mother-tigress mode when her small and unathletic son tells her that the gym teacher is out to get him. She storms the principal's office, only to discover that Andrew Fulton, the coach, is no dumb jock. As her friendship with Andrew develops, Rickie finds herself questioning her assumptions-about motherhood, being a grown-up, and falling in love.",

Growing up in rural Norfolk, Ellen\u2019s childhood was poor but blessed with affection. Resilience, spirit, and one great talent will carry her far from such humble beginnings. In time, she will become the witty, celebrated, and very beautiful Madame Ellen, dressmaker to the nobility of England, the Great Six Hundred. \u00a0 Yet Ellen has secrets. At fifteen she falls for Raoul de Valentin, the dangerous descendant of French aristocrats. Raoul marries Ellen for her brilliance as a designer but abandons his wife when she becomes pregnant. Determined that she and her daughter will survive, Ellen begins her long climb to success. Toiling first in a clothing sweat shop, she later opens her own salon in fashionable Berkeley Square though she tells the world \u2013 and her daughter - she\u2019s a widow. One single dress, a ballgown created for the enigmatic Countess of Hawksmoor, the leader of London society, transforms Ellen\u2019s fortunes, and as the years pass, business thrives. But then Raoul de Valentin returns and threatens to destroy all that Ellen has achieved. \u00a0 In The Dressmaker, the romance of Jane Austen, the social commentary of Charles Dickens and the very contemporary voice of Posie Graeme-Evans combine to plunge the reader deep into the opulent, sinister world of teeming Victorian England. And if the beautiful Madame Ellen is not quite what she seems, the strength of her will sees her through to the truth, and love, at last.",

        "Description": "\u201cFrom the outside, no matter what the gradations of my mixed heritage, the shadow of Indian brown in my skin caused others to automatically perceive me as Hindu or Muslim. . . . Still, I trekked through life with the spirit of a Jew, fleshed out by the unique challenges and wonders of a combined brown and white tradition.\u201dIn the politics of skin color, Carmit Delman is an ambassador from a world of which few are even aware. Her mother is a direct descendant of the Bene Israel, a tiny, ancient community of Jews thriving amidst the rich cultural tableau of Western India. Her father is American, a Jewish man of Eastern European descent. They met while working the land of a nascent Israeli state. Bound by love for each other and that newborn country, they hardly took notice of the interracial aspect of their union. But their daughter, Carmit, growing up in America, was well aware of her uncommon heritage.Burnt Bread and Chutney is a remarkable synthesis of the universal and the exotic. Carmit Delman\u2019s memories of the sometimes painful, sometimes pleasurable, often awkward moments of her adolescence juxtapose strikingly with mythic tales of her female ancestors living in the Indian-Jewish community. As rites and traditions, smells and textures intertwine, Carmit\u2019s unique cultural identity evolves. It is a youth spent dancing on the roofs of bomb shelters on a kibbutz in Israel\u2014and the knowledge of a heritage marked by arranged marriages and archaic rules and roles. It is coming of age in Jewish summer camps and at KISS concerts\u2014and the inevitable combination of old and new: ancient customs and modern attitudes, Jewish, Indian, and American.Carmit Delman\u2019s journey through religious traditions, family tensions, and social tribulations to a healthy sense of wholeness and self is rendered with grace and an acute sense of depth. Burnt Bread and Chutney is a rich and innovative book that opens wide a previously unseen world.",
