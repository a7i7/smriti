And when they meet at the old Greenwich Observatory, Harry is convinced there is more to Zola than meets the eye.

It\u2019s clear that America\u2019s obsession with low-fat and fat-free foods has ultimately failed. In The Fat Fallacy, neuroscientist Will Clower explains precisely why the American diet sabotages weight-loss efforts and discusses how French eating habits can lead to better health and trimmer physiques. In this revolutionary work, Dr. Clower explains: \u2022 How highly processed \u201cfake foods\u201d are the real culprit in the American diet\u2022 Why it\u2019s not just what you eat but how you eat that makes a difference\u2022 Easy ways to adopt the habits of the French to melt the pounds away, including  complete dinner recipes\u2014with dessert!Finally, here\u2019s a plan that cuts through the high-protein/low-fat debate. It\u2019s not a gimmicky diet program but a way of life that will invite Americans to enjoy food like never before\u2014while being healthier and trimmer than they ever could have imagined.",

This book offers practical guidance.The amount and diversity of information generated by academic and policy researchers in the contemporary world is staggering. How is an investigator to cope with the tens or even hundreds of studies on a particular problem? How can conflicting findings be reconciled? Richard Light and David Pillemer have developed both general guidelines and step-by-step procedures that can be used to synthesize existing data. They show how to apply quantitative methods, including the newest statistical procedures and simple graphical displays, to evaluate a mass of studies and combine separate data sets. At the same time, they insist on the value of qualitative information, of asking the right questions, and of considering the context in which research is conducted. The authors use exemplary reviews in education, psychology, health, and the policy sciences to illustrate their suggestions.Written in nontechnical language and addressed to the beginning researcher as well as to the practicing professional, Summing Up will set a new standard for valid research reviews and is likely to become a methodological classic.",

        "Authors": "By Winer, Deborah Grace and McGovern, Dennis",
        "Description": "Sing Out, Louise! is the ultimate Broadway insider's book, based on extensive interviews with scores of Broadway performers, including Gwen Verdon (Sweet Charity), Elaine Stritch (Company), Jerry Orbach (Promises, Promises), Barbara Cook (The Music Man), Carol Channing (Hello, Dolly!), Lauren Bacall (Woman of the Year, Applause), Jo Sullivan and Susan Johnson (Most Happy Fella), and Dorothy Loudon (Annie). Taking its title from Ethel Merman's famous admonition to her stage daughter in Gypsy, this is a unique backstage glimpse at the passion and commitment - and the jealousy and heartbreak - that have made Broadway the center of the American musical theatre for more than half a century.The first account of what it really feels like to perform on Broadway, Sing Out, Louise! presents behind-the-scenes anecdotes of dozens of Broadway shows, including Gypsy, Guys and Dolls, The King and I, Kiss Me, Kate, Fiorello!, Peter Pan, Sweeney Todd, Grand Hotel, City of Angels, and Miss Saigon. At the heart of the book are the complex perspectives of the performer, the supporting player as well as the star. McGovern and Winer intersperse explanatory comments and theatrical background with the performers' recollections of working with such beloved stars as Merman and Mary Martin and such directors and choreographers as Michael Bennett, George Abbott, Harold Prince, and Tommy Tune. Performers share their personal memories of trying to get cast in a Broadway show (and trying to keep their job after a successful audition); the unique and often terrifying experience of singing onstage; and performing in troubled shows that should have worked, could never have worked, closed too soon on Broadway, or never even reached New York. They discuss replacing other performers and the nightmare of going on without enough rehearsal, and what it really feels like to understudy a star - performing with the star in the wings - and then attain stardom oneself. And they unabashedly discuss Broadway in the age of Andrew Lloyd Webber, the star system, and today's life in musical theatre as well as its promising and dynamic future.",

        "Authors": "By Carroll, James",
        "Description": "From the National Book Awardwinning author of An American Requiem and Constantine's Sword comes a sweeping yet intimate look at the Pentagon and its vast often hidden impact on America.This landmark, myth-shattering work chronicles the most powerful institution in America, the people who created it, and the pathologies it has spawned. James Carroll proves a controversial thesis: the Pentagon has, since its founding, operated beyond the control of any force in government or society. It is the biggest, loosest cannon in American history, and no institution has changed this country more. To argue his case, he marshals a trove of often chilling evidence. He recounts how \"the Building\" and its denizens achieved what Eisenhower called \"a disastrous rise of misplaced power\" from the unprecedented aerial bombing of Germany and Japan during World War II to the \"shock and awe\" of Iraq. He charts the colossal U.S. nuclear buildup, which far outpaced that of the USSR, and has outlived it. He reveals how consistently the Building has found new enemies just as old threats and funding evaporate. He demonstrates how Pentagon policy brought about U.S. indifference to an epidemic of genocide during the 1990s. And he shows how the forces that attacked the Pentagon on 9/11 were set in motion exactly sixty years earlier, on September 11, 1941, when ground was broken for the house of war.Carroll draws on rich personal experience (his father was a top Pentagon official for more than twenty years) as well as exhaustive research and dozens of extensive interviews with Washington insiders. The result is a grand yet intimate work of history, unashamedly polemical and personal but unerringly factual. With a breadth and focus that no other book could muster, it explains what America has become over the past sixty years.",

        "Title": "How the Republicans Stole Christmas: The Republican Party's Declared Monopoly on Religion and What Democrats Can Do to Take It Back",
        "Authors": "By Press, Bill",
        "Description": "In the wake of an election seen by many as a triumphant victory for \u201cmoral values,\u201d political commentator and one-time seminarian Bill Press launches a counteroffensive against the so-called religious right.For decades, Press argues, conservative preachers such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, and James Dobson\u2014joined by most Catholic bishops\u2014have defined religion so narrowly that Democrats and liberals have been pushed outside the fold. According to their narrow gospel, God put George Bush in the White House to deal with gays, guns, and abortion\u2014and those who don\u2019t agree are on the sure road to hell.Bill Press says it\u2019s time to take religion back: \u201cWho gave this gang the inside track on religion, anyway? The way I read the Gospels, Jesus was as liberal as Paul Wellstone. He sure as hell wouldn\u2019t have been a registered Republican. One other thing\u2019s for sure: if Jesus ever came back to earth, there\u2019s one gang he wouldn\u2019t hang out with; and that\u2019s this phony bunch of pious, puffed-up preachers who wear religion on their sleeves.\u201dHow the Republicans Stole Christmas is also Press\u2019s fervent call to Democrats and liberals to reclaim religion and return it to its basic principles of social justice, charity, and tolerance. Press argues that the Right didn\u2019t just steal religion, the Left let them have it, offering no resistance as conservatives dictated what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. But on today\u2019s social issues, according to Press, religious conservatives have gotten it all wrong. They have turned Jesus from a loving Messiah who championed the poor and dispossessed into a cold-blooded advocate for the rich and powerful. Press does not confine his criticisms to so-called Christian leaders; he uncovers the same wrong-headed tendencies in other faiths and among nonbelievers, who even today cling to the Old Testament as an appropriate code of behavior.",

        "Authors": "By Jacobs, Michael and Palmer, Hugh",
        "Description": "From one of the most famous coastlines in the world, the Cote d'Azur, to the hills and mountains of the Luberon, the variety and culture of its villages are astounding.It is in such small communities as those so beautifully photographed by Hugh Palmer that the true spirit of Provence is to be found. Brilliant sunlight slants across jostling terra-cotta roofs, and great plane trees cast velvety shade across ancient squares where the only sound is that of a moss-covered fountain. The Most Beautiful Villages of Provence stunningly evokes the beauty and spirit of Provence, which has drawn visitors to it from ancient times to the present day. Its enduring charm is here celebrated in Palmer's magnificent photographs of such gems as Riez and its fields of lavender or the mysterious cobbled paths of Crestet. These entrancing places, and many others, make this book a lasting tribute to a magical world. Featuring a special listing of hotels, restaurants, festivals, and markets, this book celebrates a part of the world that has entranced millions.",

        "Title": "UP FROM CONSERVATISM: Why the Right is Wrong for America",
        "Authors": "By Lind, Michael",
        "Description": "For nearly a decade, Michael Lind worked closely as a writer and editor with the intellectual leaders of American conservatism. Slowly, he came to believe that the many prominent intellectuals he worked with were not the leaders of the conservative movement but the followers and apologists for an increasingly divisive and reactionary political strategy orchestrated by the Republican party. Lind's disillusionment led to a very public break with his former colleagues on the right, as he attacked the Reverend Pat Robertson for using anti-Semitic sources in his writings.In Up From Conservatism, this former rising star of the right reveals what he believes to be the disturbing truth about the hidden economic agenda of the conservative elite - and about their cynical \"culture war\" strategy for acquiring and maintaining political power.From the Civil War to the civil rights revolution, the southern elite combined a low wage, low-tax strategy for economic development with a politics of demagogy based on race-baiting and Bible-thumping. For a century, these elites dominated southern politics and economics, fortified by white resentment and the disenfranchisement of black voters. Now, Lind maintains, the economic elite that controls the Republican party is following a similar strategy on a national scale using their power to shift the tax burden from the rich to the middle class while redistributing wealth upward.To divert attention from their favoritism toward the rich, conservatives play up the \"culture war,\" channeling popular anger about falling real wages and living standards away from Wall Street and focusing it instead on the black poor and nonwhite immigrants. The right's cynical electoral strategy fabricates issues and frightens voters - particularly low income whites - into voting for Republicans whose policies are devastating the very families they claim to represent.",
