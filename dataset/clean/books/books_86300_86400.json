        "Authors": "By Naman, Christine Pisera",
        "Description": "\u201cWhen [my kindergartners] left me, they left me with the most wonderful memories and the imprints of their kisses upon my heart. To me, the blessed little events, the tiny magical moments, and the wonderful quick coincidences were like kisses.\u201d \u2014From the IntroductionA former kindergarten teacher, Christine Pisera Naman watched over many classes of five-year-olds as they made their way through the school year and discovered new things about themselves and the world around them. In Caterpillar Kisses, she turns her observations and insights into twelve delightful real-life vignettes, one for each month of the year.The stories bring to life events, large and small, that help these wiggly, unsure caterpillars grow into beautiful and confident butterflies. From a first trip to the zoo to making angels in the snow, the kids embrace every new experience with all the silliness, enthusiasm, and wonder familiar to anyone who has spent time with a five-year-old.  Naman explores the more difficult moments of childhood as well, offering sensitive, reassuring stories about the fear of thunderstorms and encountering death for the first time. Life lessons are tucked within everyday activities, including a hilarious session of learning (literally) how to walk in the other guy\u2019s shoes and another emphasizing the importance of making others feel accepted. But the students are not the only ones undergoing change. During the course of the year, their teacher learns the best way to deal with too many \u201capples for the teacher\u201d and comes to understand the true meaning of spirituality and the simple joy of dancing in the rain.Alternately laugh-out-loud funny and poignant, Caterpillar Kisses illustrates the good things that come from looking at life through the eyes of children. It is perfect for anyone looking for the magic in everyday life.\u201cLuminous! Sometimes, when spending time with children, it is just so clear that they are our teachers.\u00a0 Caterpillar Kisses shows us some of the small but tender lessons we stumble upon during the metamorphosis that occurs each and every day in a young child\u2019s life.\u201d\u2014Ann S.

        "Description": "We forget our passwords. We pay too much to go to the gym. We think we\u2019d be happier if we lived in California (we wouldn\u2019t), and we think we should stick with our first answer on tests (we shouldn\u2019t). Why do we make mistakes? And could we do a little better?We human beings have design flaws. Our eyes play tricks on us, our stories change in the retelling, and most of us are fairly sure we\u2019re way above average. In Why We Make Mistakes, journalist Joseph T. Hallinan sets out to explore the captivating science of human error\u2014how we think, see, remember, and forget, and how this sets us up for wholly irresistible mistakes.In his quest to understand our imperfections, Hallinan delves into psychology, neuroscience, and economics, with forays into aviation, consumer behavior, geography, football, stock picking, and more. He discovers that some of the same qualities that make us efficient also make us error prone. We learn to move rapidly through the world, quickly recognizing patterns\u2014but overlooking details. Which is why thirteen-year-old boys discover errors that NASA scientists miss\u2014and why you can\u2019t find the beer in your refrigerator. Why We Make Mistakes is enlivened by real-life stories\u2014of weathermen whose predictions are uncannily accurate and a witness who sent an innocent man to jail\u2014and offers valuable advice, such as how to remember where you\u2019ve hidden something important. You\u2019ll learn why multitasking is a bad idea, why men make errors women don\u2019t, and why most people think San Diego is west of Reno (it\u2019s not).Why We Make Mistakes will open your eyes to the reasons behind your mistakes\u2014and have you vowing to do better the next time.",

Based on his extensive experience in tracking the illicit nuclear trade as one of the world\u2019s foremost proliferation experts, in Peddling Peril David Albright offers a harrowing narrative of the frighteningly large cracks through which nuclear weapons traffi ckers\u2014such as Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan\u2014continue to slip. Six years after the arrest of Khan, the networks he established continue to thrive, with black markets sprouting up across the globe. The dramatic takedown of the leader of the world\u2019s largest and most perilous smuggling network was originally considered a model of savvy detection by intelligence and enforcement agencies, including the CIA and MI6. But, as Albright chronicles, the prosecutions of traffickers that were much anticipated have not come to pass, and Khan himself was released from house arrest in February 2009. Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea all use statesponsored smuggling networks that easily bypass export regulations and avoid detection. Albright illuminates how these networks have learned many ways to trick suppliers across the globe, including many in the United States, into selling them vital parts, and why, despite the fact that, since 2007, several dozen companies have been indicted\u2014with some pleading guilty\u2014for suspicion of participating in illicit trade, very few prosecutions have been achieved. Peddling Peril charts the dealings of several of these companies. Albright also reports on the hopeful story of the German company Leybold\u2019s decision to become an industry watchdog, and shows how this story reveals just how effective corporate monitoring and government cooperation would be if more serious efforts were made. Concluding with a detailed plan for clamping down tightly on the illicit trade, Albright shows the way forward in the vital mission of freeing the world of this terrifying menace.",

Along the way, readers will discover why Africa doesn't grow cocaine, why our asparagus comes from Peru, why our keyboard spells QWERTY, and why giant pandas are living on borrowed time.",

Despite the label \"teams,\" top leaders tend to avoid teaming and the real progress is made behind closed doors, not at the team meetings. After writing The Wisdom of Teams, Katzenbach discovered there are special dynamics that characterize leadership groups at the top. Many times so-called teams are really working groups with a single leader--and often, these non-team groups at the top work pretty well. He explains that the solution doesn't lie in mandating teams or in changing top leaders' styles, or even in designing a better top team structure; rather, the key is in clearly differentiating between team and non-team opportunities and developing the capability to shift into different leadership modes, different leadership roles, and appropriate team membership composition depending upon the desired results. High-performing organizations require a balanced leadership effort that fully exploits non-team as well as team approaches.",

Their wet world, oddly enough, is not so different from our own.Sherman, a great white shark, is a typical guy, and Megan is his ruthless but nurturing wife. Rounding out the aquatic crew are Fillmore the turtle, geeky fish Ernest, and macho hermit crab Hawthorne. Salty old Captain Quigley, who lost his leg to Sherman years ago, is hell-bent on seeking revenge against the shark.Sherman and friends effectively reflect human behavior and occasionally must confront humans' encroachment on their unspoiled habitat. Activist groups have applauded this comic strip with a social conscience for promoting marine conservation.Sherman's Lagoon has been syndicated since 1991, currently by King Features, and has a circulation of more than 200 daily newspapers on five continents.",

Pushed by the need to stabilize the earth's climate, and pulled by the investment opportunities that beckon, global energy markets are beginning a rapid move to more efficient, decentralized, and cleaner systems, echoing the shift from mainframe to personal computers during the 1980s. Among the emerging changes expected: a new generation of lightweight, super-efficient electric cars that can be refueled at home; the rapid conversion of coal and nuclear plants to efficient gas turbines; a new generation of mass-produced wind and solar generators that are cost-competitive with the most advanced fossil plants; tiny fuel cells and rooftop solar panels that allow people to generate their own electricity; and the gradual emergence of nonpolluting hydrogen as the world's main energy carrier, supplanting oil and natural gas. The authors of Power Surge, Christopher Flavin and Nicholas Lenssen, have identified recent deployments of new energy technologies by enterprising engineers, small entrepreneurs, and eccentric tinkerers in countries around the world, providing an early glimpse of the massive changes ahead.",

The Little Book of Wrong Shui teaches the art of moving stuff around and other key principles such as:* To encourage conversation always have one fewer chair than there are guests at a dinner party.* A chipped plate is very bad Wrong Shui. But a plate of chips is very good.* Always remember that in the journey of life two wrongs don't make a right, but three rights make a left.* Store food in your fridge alphabetically.* In any conversation, the gaps between the words the other person speaks allows negative energies to slip through and reach you. To avoid this danger endeavor to fill these gaps with low, atonal humming.* Attract visitors to your home by placing stereo, video, and computer equipment where they can be seen from the road.* If your neighbor has a satellite dish pointing in your direction, this focuses harmful \"secret arrows\" onto your home. Wait till night, then take the dish down.",

        "Title": "Dead End Gene Pool: A Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Burden, Wendy",
        "Description": "The great-great-great-great granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt takes a look at the decline of her wealthy blue-blooded family in this irreverent and wickedly funny memoir  For generations the Burdens were one of the wealthiest families in New York, thanks to the inherited fortune of Cornelius \"The Commodore\" Vanderbilt. By 1955, the year of Wendy's birth, the Burdens had become a clan of overfunded, quirky and brainy, steadfastly chauvinistic, and ultimately doomed blue bloods on the verge of financial and moral decline-and were rarely seen not holding a drink.  When her father commits suicide when Wendy is six, she and her brother are told nothing about it and are shuffled off to school as if it were any other day. Subsequently, Wendy becomes obsessed with the macabre, modeling herself after Wednesday Addams of the Addams family, and decides she wants to be a mortician when she grows up. Just days after the funeral, her mother jets off to southern climes in search of the perfect tan, and for the next three years, Wendy and her two brothers are raised mostly by a chain-smoking Scottish nanny and the long suffering household staff at their grandparent's Fifth Avenue apartment. If you think Eloise wreaked havoc at The Plaza you should see what Wendy and her brothers do in \"Burdenland\"-a world where her grandfather is the president of the Museum of Modern Art; the walls are decorated with originals of Klee, Kline, Mondrian, and Miro; and Rockefellers are regular dinner guests.  The spoiled life of the uber-rich that they live with their grandparents is in dark contrast to the life they live with their mother, a brilliant Radcliffe grad and Daughter of the American Revolution, who deals with having two men's suicides on her conscience by becoming skinnier, tanner, blonder, and more steeped in bitter alcoholism with every passing year.  We watch Wendy's family unravel as she travels between Fifth Avenue, Virginia horse country, Mount Desert Island in Maine, the Jupiter Island Club, London, and boarding school, coming through all of it surprisingly intact. Rife with humor, heartbreak, family intrigue, and booze, Dead End Gene Pool offers a glimpse into the eccentric excess of old money and gives truth to the old maxim: The rich are different.Watch a Video",

        "Description": "Does your imaginative, computer-proficient daughter tune out in the classroom? Does your spirited son become headstrong and aggressive when faced with the simplest decisions? Does your bold, energetic child have trouble focusing on basic tasks?Millions of children--one in five--have what psychologist Lucy Jo Palladino, Ph.D., calls the Edison trait: dazzling intelligence, an active imagination, a free-spirited approach to life, and the ability to drive everyone around them crazy. Named after Thomas Edison--who flunked out of school only to harness his talents and give the world some of its finest inventions--the Edison trait is on the rise in our younger generation. The heart of the issue is that they think divergently--they overflow with many ideas--while schools, organized activities, and routines of daily living reward convergent thinking, which focuses on one idea at a time. Drawing on examples from more than two decades of private practice, Dr. Palladino helps us cope with this challenging aspect of our child's intellect and personality, explaining in clear terms:- The three Edison-trait personality types: dreamers, discoverers, and dynamos- The eight steps to understanding, reaching, and teaching your Edison-trait child- The connection between the Edison trait and A.D.D.",
