        "Title": "Process This!: New Recipes for the New Generation of Food Processors plus Dozens of Time-Saving Tips",
        "Authors": "By Anderson, Jean",
        "Description": "Compared to today's racy new food processors, early models seem positively antiquated. Among the cutting-edge innovations: mini bowl and blade inserts for standard models ... kinder, gentler dough modes that knead yeast doughs to perfection ... reversible blades, one side for grinding, one for chopping ... powerful braking actions that allow you to control the degree of chop ... sleek keypads that make clean-up a breeze.The new generation of food processors, so powerful, so versatile, needs a new deriver's manual, a cookbook to teach you how to use them to their best advantage. Process This! is that book.Award-winning cookbook author Jean Anderson has spent two years putting the new processors through their paces and developing recipes specifically for them. (Don't worry, they work in older machines too; in fact they'll make them perform better than ever.)Anderson has turned some 150 popular recipes upside-down, changing the order of mixing so that you can now prep almost anything by processor. Flaky piecrust? No problem. Pat\u00e9s, rustic or refined? A snap. Melt-in-your-mouth shortbread? You bet. Salsas and guacamole with plenty of texture? Sure thing. Asian stir-fries? Of course. Feathery cakes? Why not? Anderson has even turned the food processor into a bread machine, using it to do everything but shape and bake.Throughout Process This! you'll find dozens of time-saving tips and techniques. Why not mince parsley while you crumb bread? With meatloaves and casserole toppings so often calling for both, it makes sense. Why not processor-grate strips of lemon-zest? It's easy if you add a little sugar or salt. Chop onions and bell peppers in tandem? Whiz together all the dry ingredients for a cake or quick bread, then cut in the butter instead of creaming it separately? This is one-bowl mixing at its best.Process This! is much more than a cookbook, however. Its dictionary of foods teaches you how to slice, dice, chop, shred, and pur\u00e9e everything from apples to zucchini. There's even a handy table of equivalents to tell you exactly how many slices of bread you need for one cup of crumbs or how many onions it takes for one cup of coarsely chopped.The 150 recipes range from simple to sophisticated: Two-Pepper Parmesan Wafers ... Chicken Liver and Red Onion Jam Pat\u00e9 ... Instant Icy Avocado Soup ... Penne with Midsummer Tomato Sauce ... Crispy Parmesan-Crumbled Chicken ... Ossobucco ... Old-Timey Corn Custard ... Two Potato Gratin with Bacon and Leeks ... Cheddar Scones ... Focaccia ... Frozen Lemongrass-Mango Mousse ... Toasted Hazelnut Tart ... Rugelach.Whether you are a new cook, an experienced one, or even a professional, you will find Process This! as indispensable as your food processor.",

Now Rooney has collected the funniest, wisest, and most interesting of his letters, spanning several decades and addressing issues both momentous and trivial. He responds to complaints from viewers; he corresponds with old friends; and he writes to his children about the things he cares about most.

        "Description": "Surveying the times in which the extraordinarily popular poet Catullus thrived?ca. 84?54 B.C., the golden days of the Roman Republic?Aubrey Burl reconstructs the life of a man who epitomized an era. Catullus demonstrated a genius for the epigram, as well as the lyric, for heartfelt love songs and moving elegies. Nor did Catullus leave himself out of his pungent, spare, ironic, and superbly crafted verses, reflecting not only his personal temperament but also his perceived values, and often disparages, in a Rome increasingly beset by civil war, moral laxity, and social unrest. This book takes Catullus from his native Verona, where he grew up in wealth and influence, to Rome and to fame. A well-liked, sociable man, he entertained his friends in the lavish fashion of his day while he amused and shocked his public with urbane poetic trifles. He intrigued his public with love poems addressed to Lesbia?in reality, a married woman named Clodia?with whom he had a tempestuous affair. Though brilliant by any standard, these intimate lyrics would not save Catullus from centuries of obscurity, although they would eventually emerge in a lone third generation copy of a book in the fourteenth century, in his hometown of Verona.",

        "Description": "From master of mystery Robert Barnard comes a brilliantly witty and piercingly observant new suspense novel featuring one of the most dysfunctional families ever to grace crime fiction.  Meet the Cantelos of Leeds, England. To call the Cantelos dysfunctional is actually a wild understatement. But is one of them also a killer?  Clarissa Cantelo, a skilled clairvoyant, apparently thought so. Believing that her sixteen-year-old nephew, Merlyn Docherty, was in peril, she sent him into hiding in Italy, far away from the rest of her family. She told them he was dead. It was safer that way.  Now Clarissa herself has died, and Merlyn, a successful lawyer and civil servant who still lives abroad, has returned to Leeds to claim his inheritance. First, he must prove his identity. Is he really Merlyn or, as some of his long-lost relations say they suspect, is he an imposter?  Merlyn doesn't mind confirming his identity, but he'd at least like to move into the house that Aunt Clarissa left him in her will while he gets to know some of his relatives. And the house may hold some clues to the Cantelos' past.  What is the dreadful family secret that has upset relations between mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, filling even the youngest generation with fear? If Merlyn discovers the truth, buried under decades of deception, his life may once again be in danger.  Merlyn must start at the beginning if he is to find the answers. All roads seem to lead back to his grandfather, the formidable Merlyn Cantelo, renowned in the family as an object of both fear and loathing.  Though the old man who caused such pain to his family died years ago, his malevolence lives on. Somebody wants young Merlyn gone. With help from police detectives Mike Oddie and Charlie Peace, Merlyn must find that person before the Cantelo curse works its evil again.  Wickedly observant and full of his trademark sly twists, The Graveyard Position proves once more that Robert Barnard is in a class of his own.",

Kramer's Discount Furniture Depot sits away from several lanes of traffic, near the tombstone of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is here that Jane escapes each day at lunchtime to ponder her confusing turn in life.  At age forty-one, she has a teenage Goth son, her husband is increasingly overweight and quick-tempered, and their business is in a state of crisis, both financially and legally. Jane finds herself wishing for something more. First, add to the mix Delia, a mysterious and strangely predatory patio-furniture saleswoman who seems to have her sights set on Leon, and then an attack on the store expansion plans by historic preservationists. When potentially disturbing findings about Delia's past come to light, Jane finds herself learning that, despite life's reversals, it is possible to reinvent herself by tapping into talents and desires she didn't realize she still had.  Rockville Pike is a smart, witty, and funny read that revels in the joy of discovering what life has in store.",

In these pages, Moyers presents, for the first time, a powerful statement of his own personal beliefs\u2014political and moral. Combining illuminating forays into American history with candid comments on today\u2019s politics, Moyers delivers perceptive and trenchant insights into the American experience.From his early years as a Texas journalist to his role as one of the organizers of the Peace Corps, top assistant to President Lyndon Johnson, publisher of Newsday, senior correspondent and analyst for CBS News, and producer of many of public television\u2019s groundbreaking series, Moyers has been actively engaged in some of the most volatile episodes of the past fifty years. Drawing from this practical experience, he demonstrates a unique understanding of how American politics works and an enduring faith in the nation\u2019s promises and possibilities. Whether reflecting on today\u2019s climate of megamedia concentration, rampant corporate scandals, or religious and political upheavals, Moyers on America recovers the hopes of the past to establish their relevance for the present.",

Lehman profiles naval greats from John Paul Jones to William \"Bull\" Halsey, as well as the lesser-known sailors who have made the U.S. Navy the mightiest in the world, using diaries, memoirs, and letters to reveal naval combat as though firsthand. He also highlights the warships that have dominated the seas of their day and the battles in which they fought -- illustrated by detailed maps, woodcuts, paintings, and never-before-published photographs.  With this chronicle of selfless sacrifice and awesome courage on the war-swept seas around the world, Lehman reminds us that the legends chronicled in these pages were real men and women, that the navy they fought for still sails, and that today their heroism is needed more than ever.",

        "Description": "When Nan Mooney was seven years old, she sat down in her grandmother May-May's living room to watch her first ever horse race. In that single afternoon, she launched what would become a turbulent romance between a woman and a sport.My Racing Heart is part memoir, part journey into the compelling world of Thoroughbred horse racing. At its heart is Nan's relationship with her grandmother, an adventurer, racing connoisseur, and woman of courage and compassion. May-May fostered in Nan a love of Thoroughbreds and the track, ushering her into a rare corner of the world where risk taking is daily currency.Nan thought her emotional link to the races died with May-May, only to have it roar back to life a decade later at New York's Belmont Park. This renewed relationship culminates in a grown-up appreciation for a universe where expectations are constantly defied, and in the realization of a longtime dream -- a trip to the Kentucky Derby.Far more than just a personal tale, My Racing Heart lets readers in on the wild culture and fabulous creatures that rise up around the racetrack. Nan Mooney probes every aspect of the sport: the horses, jockeys, and trainers, the gambling and corruption, its ages-old history, and its forever offbeat society. She takes readers from the backstretch of a small-town track to the stands at Churchill Downs, from the mind of an intrepid gambler to the soul of a Thoroughbred. She explores how the sport itself, and the men and women who participate in it, flourish upon the principle that there are no sure things.My Racing Heart will speak to every horse lover, to every sports nut, and to everyone who cherishes the thrill of possibility or has ever craved a place to run wild. This unique and exquisite memoir perfectly captures the lure, the glory, and the heartbeat of the track.",

What would Buzz Aldrin see if he were here? On Earth, plagues have destroyed the major food supplies, climatic changes have brought constant winter to the once-industrialized West, and a new and virulent virus--P2--has infected Earth's population, bringing radical change in economic, political, and social structures. P2 is curable--but only with an infusion of uninfected blood. Indeed, blood has become the currency of choice: It is banked, speculated in, traded, hoarded, but only by those wealthy enough (or healthy enough) to have a clean, uninfected supply. And the moon? It is now home to sex hotels and penal colonies. Home, too, to the \"federal reserve\" of blood banks--the most impregnable high-security installation in the world. It is the brainchild of one man--and he has every reason to destroy it. Acting on the most human of motives--revenge--he will take on the impossible. Unbeknownst to him, he will have help from a very strange source. Call it 2001 updated. Call it a chillingly convincing mix of prophecy and science. Call it Philip Kerr's best book yet. The Second Angel: 1999's prologue to 2069, a terrifying forecast of the future.",

        "Description": "?You can\u2019t love someone until you learn to love yourself.\u201d ?Being healthy means being in touch with your feelings.\u201d ?Never lose hope.\" These are self-evident truths, right?Wrong charges best-selling psychologist Paul Pearsall in this provocative new book. Though everyone from talk show hosts to politicians mouths these platitudes, and self-help bibles are a dime a dozen, their advice simply hasn\u2019t helped us live happier or more satisfying lives. Pearsall cites scientific evidence to challenge what he calls the McMorals of self-potentialism: the unsubstantiated prescriptions, programs, guarantees, and gurus that define our pursuit of The Good Life.His message is timely: we\u2019re fed up with truisms masquerading as truth, and hungry for self-help that really helps. Filled with groundbreaking research and inspiring true stories from Dr. Pearsall\u2019s clinical practice, The Last Self-Help Book You\u2019ll Ever Need offers a powerful antidote to the mindless mental languishing that characterizes so much of modern life.The solution is not just to ?get tough and suck it up.\u201d Instead, Pearsall offers powerful if counterintuitive strategies. By abandoning the mandate to ?stay hopeful,\u201d for example, we can begin to savor today rather than focus desperately on tomorrow. By allowing ourselves the natural process of grieving instead of relentlessly treating grief as a disease, we can recover from tragedy.With Pearsall\u2019s lively and informative roadmap to psychological health, we can say ?goodbye\u201d to our inner child and ?hello\u201d to a better life.",

Full of personal anecdotes and real-wife wisdom, her latest Confessions offers precious comic relief and an invitation for wives everywhere to join the ranks!A slacker wife has the wisdom to accept the following: that a little dirt on her kitchen floor doesn\u2019t hurt anyone, that wrinkles on her husband\u2019s shirt and on her face are perfectly natural and not worth worrying about, that party guests can be just as happy with a bowl of chips as an elaborate salmon mousse, and that over-scheduled equals under-happy. Above all, a slacker wife lets herself have fun being a wife. She has girls\u2019 weekends, orders take-out, and takes leisurely walks. And as a result, she, her husband, and her family are happier and healthier?even with a dirty kitchen floor and a wrinkled shirt.",

Two of the last three American presidents\u2014and three of the last eight\u2014have been Texans. Each of them got to the White House by exploiting a network of money and power that no other state can match. In Cronies, renowned investigative reporter Robert Bryce illuminates how Texas turned its vast energy resources into political power, and how a small group of Texas corporations, lawyers and politicians use that power to protect and defend their own economic interests. Through an absorbing narrative that moves from the days of the oil boom, through the rise and reign of LBJ, to today, Bryce profiles the Texans and the Texas corporations who have wielded\u2014and continue to wield\u2014great power in America's domestic and foreign policy, including the Bushes, James A. Baker III, Halliburton, Baker Botts, Ray Hunt, Bell Helicopter, and more. He shows how massive transfers of wealth from the rest of the country to Texas have allowed the state to prosper. Cronies demonstrates how George W. Bush is the living embodiment of Texas' crony networks, and how those networks continue to play critical roles in the 21st century. Distinguished by the same crack investigative skills and colorful storytelling that reviewers loved in Pipe Dreams, Cronies not only explains the astonishing rise of Texas; it offers a timely, provocative new way to look at American politics and our deadly entanglements in Iraq.",

The cars we drive, the food we eat, the water we drink-their safety has been enhanced largely due to Ralph Nader. His inspiration and example have rallied consumer advocates, citizen activists, public interest lawyers, and government officials into action, and in the 2000 election, nearly three million people voted for him.An inspiring and defiant memoir, Crashing the Party takes us inside Nader's campaign and explains what it took to fight the two-party juggernaut; why Bush and Gore were really afraid to let him in on their debates; why progressive Democrats have been left behind and ignored by their party; how Democrat and Republican interests have been lost to corporate bankrolling; and what needs to happen in the future for people to take back their political system.",

In an effort to retrieve his past, he withdraws to the family home somewhere in the hills between Milan and Turin.There, in the sprawling attic, he searches through boxes of old newspapers, comics, records, photo albums, and adolescent diaries. And so Yambo relives the story of his generation: Mussolini, Catholic education and guilt, Josephine Baker, Flash Gordon, Fred Astaire. His memories run wild, and the life racing before his eyes takes the form of a graphic novel. Yambo struggles through the frames to capture one simple, innocent image: that of his first love.

And millions more choose to work because we love our careers. So how are women holding on to financially necessary or stimulating and rewarding careers and still being engaged mothers? Wendy Sachs, journalist and mother of two, set out to find what's really happening at the intersection of motherhood and work today. Based on her in-depth interviews with mothers from diverse backgrounds, How She Really Does It explores the creative and courageous ways in which stay-at- work moms are making it happen. Here are the moms next door-as well as lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, fashion designers, journalists, and television personalities-who are navigating the everyday work/home conflicts, and, yes, dealing with the guilt. Through it all, they are empowered career women and caring, present mothers. A modern working woman's survival guide, How She Really Does It will give you hope that even if you can't have it all, you can have at least some of it all of the time.",

        "Description": "On his long journey home from the Third Crusade, Richard the Lionheart--one of history's most powerful and romantic figures--was ship-wrecked near Venice in the Adriatic Sea. Forced to make his way home by land through enemy countries, he traveled in disguise, but was eventually captured by Duke Leopold V of Austria, who in turn conveyed him to Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor. Henry demanded a majestic ransom, and Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, raised the historic sum--one quarter of the entire wealth of England--and Richard was returned. But a peculiar legend followed him--that a troubadour named Blondel, a friend of Richard's, had journeyed across Europe singing a song he knew Richard would recognize in order to discover his secret place of imprisonment.David Boyle recreates the drama of the Third Crusade and the dynamic power politics and personalities of the late 12th century in Europe, as well as the growing fascination with romance and chivalry embodied in the troubadour culture. An evocation of a pivotal era, The Troubadour's Song is narrative history at its finest.",

This is the question that poet Kathleen Norris asks us as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at St. John's Abbey in Minnesota.Part record of her time among the Benedictines, part meditation on various aspects of monastic life, The Cloister Walk demonstrates, from the rare perspective of someone who is both an insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world-- its liturgy, its ritual, its sense of community-- can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives. In this stirring and lyrical work, the monastery, often considered archaic or otherworldly, becomes immediate, accessible, and relevant to us, no matter what our faith may be.",

Now in Dogs Never Lie About Love, controversial psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson brilliantly navigates the rich inner landscape of \"our best friends.\"As he guides readers through the surprising depth of canine emotional complexity, Jeffrey Masson draws from myth and literature, from scientific studies, and from the stories and observations of dog trainers and dog lovers around the world. But the stars of the book are the author's own three dogs whose delightful and mysterious behavior provides the way to exploring a wide range of subjects--from emotions like gratitude, compassion, loneliness, and disappointment to speculating what dogs dream of and how their powerful sense of smell shapes their perception of reality. As he sweeps aside old prejudices on animal behavior, Masson reaches into a rich universe of dog feeling to its essential core, their \"master emotion\": love.Like the dogs he loves, Masson's writing will capture the reader with its playful, mysterious, and serious sides. Its surprising insights provide a new dimension of understanding for dog owners everywhere.",

        "Description": "An essential guide to understanding children's language from the first days of babbling through a five-year-old's mastery of reading. How children learn language is an endlessly fascinating subject, with new research revising our views every day. In Growing a Reader from Birth, seasoned researcher Diane McGuinness reviews the latest findings on just how much infants, toddlers, and preschoolers know and are capable of expressing from the early months on. Chapters covering each year of a child's language growth link this new knowledge to McGuinness's own innovative program for children's mastery of reading. She charts how a child first makes sense of the world of sound and symbols and then progresses from recognizing and decoding words to developing a vocabulary and using it to become a good listener, an expert reader, and an eloquent speaker. Growing a Reader from Birth not only illuminates the stages of language learning in children but also equips parents with indispensable advice on how to maximize their interactions with their children and be a positive force in nurturing their child's language from day one.",

        "Title": "Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America",
        "Authors": "By Sunstein, Cass R.",
        "Description": "Most people think that the Supreme Court has a rough balance between left and right. This is a myth; in fact the justices once considered right-wing have now taken the mantle of the Court's moderates, and the liberal element has all but disappeared. Most people also think that judicial activism is solely a liberal movement. This is also a myth; since William Rehnquist was confirmed as Chief Justice in 1986, the Supreme Court has engaged in an unprecedented record of judicial activism. These two factors are feeding a movement to restore what many conservatives call \"The Constitution in Exile,\" by which they mean the Constitution as it existed before the Roosevelt administration. Radicals in Robes explains what the restoration of this constitutional vision would mean. It would mean the end of the FCC, the SEC, the EPA, and every other federal agency that enacts regulations that have the force of law. It would mean that the clause of the First Amendment that says that Congress may make no law \"respecting an establishment of religion\" would be turned on its head. Marriage laws and many other familiar areas of modern life are all in the sights of this conservative movement. Radicals in Robes takes judicial philosophy out of the law schools and shows what it means when it intersects partisan politics. It pulls away the veil of rhetoric from a dangerous and radical right-wing movement and issues a strong and passionate warning about what conservatives really intend. One of the most respected legal theorists in the country, Cass R. Sunstein here issues a warning of compelling concern to us all.",

        "Description": "On his 18th birthday, Ryan Knighton was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a congenital, progressive disease marked by night-blindness, tunnel vision and, eventually, total blindness.  In this penetrating, nervy memoir, which ricochets between meditation and black comedy, Knighton tells the story of his fifteen-year descent into blindness while incidentally revealing the world of the sighted in all its phenomenal peculiarity.      Knighton learns to drive while unseeing; has his first significant relationship?with a deaf woman; navigates the punk rock scene and men's washrooms; learns to use a cane; and tries to pass for seeing while teaching English to children in Korea.  Stumbling literally and emotionally into darkness, into love, into couch-shopping at Ikea, into adulthood, and into truce if not acceptance of his identity as a blind man, his writerly self uses his disability to provide a window onto the human condition.  His experience of blindness offers unexpected insights into sight and the other senses, culture, identity, language, our fears and fantasies.    Cockeyed is not a conventional confessional.  Knighton is powerful and irreverent in words and thought and impatient with the preciousness we've come to expect from books on disability.  Readers will find it hard to put down this wild ride around their everyday world with a wicked, smart, blind guide at the wheel.",

Within the space of two years he was fired from Vanity Fair, banned from the most fashionable bar in the city, and couldn't get a date for love or money. Even the local AA group wanted nothing to do with him.How to Lose Friends and Alienate People is Toby Young's hilarious and best-selling account of the five years he spent looking for love in all the wrong places and steadily working his way down the New York food chain, from glossy magazine editor to crash-test dummy for interactive sex toys. A seditious attack on the culture of celebrity from inside the belly of the beast, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People is also a \"nastily funny read.\" --USA Today",

Hastings chalks it up with all the other senseless murders he sees in the course of a month, a year, a lifetime, of policing. As he investigates, though, it soon becomes clear that Franklin was far from just another innocent victim - but was she really a vengeful blackmailer? And is the murderer one of her own high-powered lovers from whom Franklin may have been extorting money? Or is it one of her reckless and feckless housemates, high on the drugs they all shared and fueled by jealousy over her many lovers?Lisa Franklin's wild life provides too few clues and too many suspects. Her journals, however, containing fragments of poetry and ruminations, hint at a fragile brilliance behind the brittle facade and draw Hastings to her posthumously.",

Here is the same meticulous prose brought to bear on the inner workings of a terrifying elemental force; here is a cast of characters risking everything in an effort to bring that force under control.Few writers have been to so many desperate corners of the globe as has Sebastian Junger; fewer still have provided such starkly memorable evocations of characters and events. From the murderous mechanics of the diamond trade in Sierra Leone to the logic of guerrilla warfare in Afghanistan and the forensics of genocide in Kosovo, this new collection of Junger's nonfiction will take you places you wouldn't dream of going to on your own.",

        "Title": "What Time Is It? You Mean Now?: Advice for Life from the Zennest Master of Them All",
        "Authors": "By Berra, Yogi and Kaplan, Dave",
        "Description": "Could Confucius hit a curveball? Could Yoda block the plate? Can the Dalai Lama dig one out of the dirt? No, there is only one Zen master who could relay his wisdom while gloving a relay, ponder perfection while catching a perfect game, and contemplate the circle of life while rounding the bases.  Who is this guru lurking in the grand old game? Well, he's the winner of ten World Series rings, a member of both the Hall of Fame and the All-Century Team, and perhaps the most popular and beloved ballplayer of all time. And without effort or artifice he's waxed poetic on the mysteries of time (\"It gets late awful early out there\"), the meaning of community (\"It's so crowded nobody goes there anymore\"), and even the omnipresence of hope in the direst circumstances (\"It ain't over 'til it's over\").  It's Yogi Berra, of course, and in What Time Is It? You Mean Now?, Yogi expounds on the funny, warm, borderline inadvertent insights that are his trademark. Twenty-six chapters, one for each letter from A to Z, examine the words, the meaning, and the uplifting example of a kid from St. Louis who grew up to become the consummate Yankee and the ultimate Yogi.  Included in this treasury of inspired and inspiring Yogi-isms are such eloquent and thought-provoking pearls of wisdom as:  \"I ain't in a slump. I'm just not hitting,\" encouraging us to stay positive even in the face of adversity.  \"Why be jealous over things you don't have?\" counseling us to take joy in all the good things in our lives -- without envying others.  \"You can observe a lot by watching,\" reminding us to be open to the possibility of surprise and wonder in the world around us.  \"It's like d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu all over again,\" because, after all, you don't have to believe in reincarnation to know that history repeats itself.  Touching on all things great and not so great, Yogi imparts to us his one-of-a-kind wisdom and famously quirky humor, illuminating the subtle truths at work in our lives. Overflowing with improbable insight and enlightening advice, What Time Is It? You Mean Now? is the essential guide to the world according to Yogi.",
