        "Description": "What do hot chicken soup for breakfast and cold spaghetti at midnight have in common?The power to comfort, revive, and even heal, or so goes the wisdom of folk medicine. The body and the mind respond quite miraculously to nourishment and intelligent therapy - and food is the first and best medicine in both cases.Maggie Waldron, a storyteller par excellence and a true exponent of commonsense health, concurs. In this irresistible and persuasive volume she convinces us of the remarkable curative powers and psychological benefits hidden in even the most ordinary foods.She explains comforters and revivers, the foods and remedies drawn from our warmest childhood memories, the foods we still turn to when we're blue and out of sorts: steaming cinnamon tea on a bleak winter night, cooling sherbet for a sore throat, cold spaghetti for a nighttime raid on the refrigerator to erase a trying day.Ms. Waldron teaches us how fasting cleanses and clears the decks of toxins. She analyzes one hundred foods, herbs, and spices that can actually heal bodies and even ward off certain diseases, from that now proverbial chicken soup rich in mother love to fruits and vegetables containing beta carotene, effective against some types of cancers. She offers age-old remedies for dozens of ills from migraines (the herb feverfew) to hayfever (stone fruits) to insomnia (a spoonful of molasses) to motion sickness (fresh ginger), and stomach cramps (anise).Throughout, there are more than 150 recipes, from cornbread to egg creams and the king of gumbos, that will let you keep those health-giving foods on hand.This is the book to curl up with when you're sick, when you're well, when you need to be advised and would love to be entertained. Maggie Waldron tells her stories and offers her advice with incomparable wit and charm. She'll probably make you feel as good as cold spaghetti at midnight tastes.",

        "Title": "Saul and Patsy: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Baxter, Charles",
        "Description": "1. How does the town of Five Oaks, Michigan figure as a character in the novel? How is it a particularly Midwestern town? How do the various town folk\u2014whom Saul refers to as \u201crural Gentiles, connoisseurs of rifles, violence, and piety\u201d\u2014play into the narrative? Harold the barber, the local high school teachers and students, Mrs. O\u2019Neil the lonely neighbor, the various students, Susan the bank teller, Brenda Gordy\u2019s aunt? 2. 2. Saul and Patsy are definitely outsiders in this small Midwestern town. What sets Saul apart from the other inhabitants? Does his Jewishness play a role, or is this largely in Saul\u2019s imagination? By the end, are they Midwesterners as well? 3. 3. Saul views himself as a missionary, \u201cbringing education and the higher enlightenments to rural benighted adolescents.\u201d What exactly is a missionary? Do you think Saul is one? Later in the novel when asked if he is going to stay in the Midwest, Saul responds, \u201cI have to. I\u2019m on a mission. We are.\u201d What is this mission? Is it ultimately to save himself or others? And from what? 4. Discuss the relationship between Saul and Patsy. Compare and contrast them. Why is theirs such a fulfilled and satisfied relationship despite their different views on love? \u201cIn Saul, love took the form of desperation-to-share.\u201d For Patsy, \u201cshe might have loved anybody, but it had turned out to be this man\u2026there was certainly no logic to it.\u201d What determines and then later threatens to undermine their marriage? What is the author saying of love? Describe the other marriages in the book, that of Saul\u2019s parents, and the McPhees. 5. 5. How does having a child transform Saul and Patsy\u2019s life? Do they change individually and/or as a couple? What do they learn about each other in the process of accepting a third person into their world, and growing from a couple into a family? 6. After meeting the McPhees, Saul \u201cbegan to be obsessed with happiness\u201d and realized \u201ccompared to others, he was, except for his marriage, actually and truly unhappy.\u201d He becomes preoccupied with the McPhees and their happiness without really knowing much about their lives. Why the jealousy and obsession? 7. Saul and Patsy overflows with references to written words. Saul teaches writing at the local high school and later writes a newspaper column. Saul and Patsy adore Scrabble and crossword puzzles. Various authors are referred to and quoted. Saul writes on Patsy\u2019s body. Gordy leaves notes for Saul. What is the importance of the written word in the novel? Give examples of the success and the failure of words in the novel. 8. Discuss the theme of betrayal in Saul and Patsy . What types of betrayal occur? What are the causes and consequences of them? Are the betrayals justified? Is anyone innocent? As a teacher, does Saul betray Gordy? As a brother, does Howie betray Saul? Does Patsy betray Delia? 9. Does Gordy Himmelman represent or symbolize something larger than himself, a troubled teen, to Saul and to the novel as a whole? What? Why is he obsessed with Saul, and why does he commit suicide in front of him? 10. 10. What does Saul learn about himself and his relationship with Patsy and his family through his experiences with Gordy? Through his experiences in Five Oaks? What does Patsy learn? 11. Why do you think the adolescents of Five Oaks react the way they do after Gordy Himmelman\u2019s death? Is it indicative of Five Oaks, the Midwest, our society as a whole? Do you think the reaction is realistic? 12. Discuss the role and importance of the media and television in the novel. Is the author making a social commentary on the media and its omnipresence? 13. At various points throughout Saul and Patsy , characters invade other characters\u2019 privacy. Give some specific instances of characters trespassing or spying on other characters. What is really going on in these situations? 14. Discuss the significance of the conclusion. Why does the novel end this way? What do you think is in the future for Saul and Patsy?",

        "Description": "Reynolds Price has long been one of America's most acclaimed and accomplished men of letters - the author of novels, stories, poems, essays, plays, and a memoir. In A Whole New Life, however, he steps from behind that roster of achievements to present us with a more personal story, a narrative as intimate and compelling as any work of the imagination.In 1984 a large cancer was discovered in his spinal cord (\"The tumor was pencil-thick and gray-colored, ten inches long from my neck-hair downward\"). Here, for the first time. Price recounts without self-pity what became a long struggle to withstand and recover from this appalling, if all too common, affliction (one American in three will experience some form of cancer). He charts the first puzzling symptoms; the urgent surgery that fails to remove the growth and the radiation that temporarily arrests it (but hurries his loss of control of his lower body); the occasionally comic trials of rehab; the steady rise of severe pain and reliance on drugs; two further radical surgeries; the sustaining force of a certain religious vision: an eventual discovery of help from biofeedback and hypnosis; and the miraculous return of his powers as a writer in a new, active life.Beyond the particulars of pain and mortal illness, larger concerns surface here - a determination to get on with the human interaction that is so much a part of this writer's much-loved work, the gratitude he feels toward kin and friends and some (though by no means all) doctors, the return to his prolific work, and the \"now appalling, now astonishing grace of God.\"A Whole New Life offers more than the portrait of one brave person in tribulation; it offers honest insight, realistic encouragement, and inspiration to others who suffer the bafflement of catastrophic illness or who know someone who does or will.",

        "Description": "Plains Indians from different tribes speaking different languages were nevertheless able to communicate facts and feelings of considerable complexity when they met. They used a language composed of gestures made almost entirely with the hands and fingers, probably the most highly developed gesture language to be found in any part of the world.With this book, you will find it simple to use this language, which the author learned in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, principally from Sioux Indians in Wyoming. Drawings and short descriptions make clear the proper positions and motions of the hands to convey the meaning of over 870 alphabetically arranged common words \u2014 hungry, camp, evening, angry, fire, laugh, owl, cat, many times, brave, cold, heart, rain, spotted, together, river, etc. The words are then used in sample sentences. There are also brief sections on the pictography and ideography of the Sioux and Ojibway tribes, and on smoke signals.This is a book for anyone who wants to learn or teach Indian sign language \u2014 scouts, school teachers, camp counselors, scout leaders, parents, linguists, and students of Indian culture. To help counselors and teachers, the last chapters give instructions on how to conduct the Indian ceremony for opening a council fire, an Indian initiation ceremony, and suggestions for sign language tests and exercises.",

        "Authors": "By Shanks, Hershel (EDT)",
        "Description": "A groundbreaking anthology that demolishes the myths -- and reveals the true significance -- of the greatest archaeological discovery of our time.Ever since their initial discovery in 1947, the Dead Sea Scrolls have aroused excitement, jealousy, and not a little dread among some who feared their contents might undermine the foundations of Judaism and Christianity. For more than 35 years the majority of scroll texts remained the intellectual property of an exclusive coterie of scholars. Recently, however, the Biblical Archaeology Review succeeded in breaking that monopoly.This path-clearing volume is an illuminating assessment of what these texts reveal about a lost era in the history of two world religions, Christianity and rabbinic Judaism. Were the Dead Sea Scrolls written by the Essenes, an ascetic sect of Jews that may have included John the Baptist among its members? Is the Copper Scroll a secret map to the treasures of the Jerusalem Temple? In what way do these books prefigure the teachings of early Christianity? Additional chapters address the controversies surrounding the Scrolls' discovery and their long suppression -- including the possible role of the Vatican and charges of anti-Semitism on the part of a former chief editor of the official scroll publication team.",

The reaction by parents, teachers, and peers to our own actions often determines our sense of self--how confident we feel and how secure we are about our place in the world. When self-blame and pessimism begin to overtake self-esteem and optimism, the result may be emotional, physical, and spiritual distress.

        "Description": "For Annie Barnes, going home to Middle River means dealing with truths long hidden, some of which she buried there herself. But it is a journey she knows she must take if she is to put to rest, once and for all, her misgivings about her mother's recent death.To an outsider, Middle River is a picture-perfect New Hampshire town. But Annie grew up there, and she knows all its secrets - as did her idol Grace Metalious, author of the infamous novel Peyton Place, which laid a small town's sexual secrets bare for all the world to see. Though Grace actually lived in a nearby town, the residents of Middle River have always believed she used them as the model for her revolutionary novel, and some even insist Annie's grandmother was the model for one of Grace's most scandalous characters. With these rumors and whispers about Peyton Place haunting her childhood, Annie came to identify so closely with the author that it was Grace and her bold rebellion against 1950s conformity that inspired Annie to get out of Middle River and make a life for herself in Washington, D.C.It's been a good life, too. Annie Barnes is now a bestselling author, reaching that level with only her third novel. Success has given her a confidence she never had as a young girl in Middle River - and it has given the residents of that town something new to worry about. When they hear Annie is returning for a lengthy visit, everyone, including Annie's two sisters, believes she's coming home to write about them.Though amused by the discomfort she causes in Middle River, Annie has no intention of writing a novel about the town or its people. It is her mother's death - under circumstances that don't quite add up - that has brought her back, and soon her probing questions start to make people nervous. When she discovers evidence of dangerous pollutants emanating from the local paper mill - poisons that she comes to believe contributed to her mother's fatal illness - Annie finds herself at odds with most of the town's inhabitants, including her sisters, both of whom are seemingly unfazed by the incriminating evidence she uncovers. Because the mill is the town's main employer, everyone is afraid of what might happen if Annie digs deeper, and their fears soon start to turn ugly.For Annie, though, there is no turning back, as passion and rage propel her forward in a determined quest. Coming face-to-face with decades of secrets and lies, she knows she must find the strength to move beyond the legacy of Grace Metalious, defying her past to heal the wounds of the town and her own family.",

        "Description": "The Holy Vote examines the way Americans worship, how organized religion and politics intersect in America, and how this powerful collision is transforming the current and future American mind-setNot since the Civil War has the United States been sopolarized\u2014politically and ideologically. But at the very heart of this fracture is a fascinating rig and paradoxical marriage between our country\u2019s politics and religions.Over the past several election cycles, the differences between so-called \"Red America\"\u2014conservative, church-affiliated, suburban, and rural\u2014and \"Blue America\"\u2014urban, secular, and socially liberal\u2014have hardened. Although on most days, these two big American mainstreams move on parallel tracks, they increasingly find themselves head to head, ready to fight at the slightest offense. They react to new stories in different ways. They react to government power in different ways. They certainly vote in different ways. With The Holy Vote, Ray Suarez explores the advent of this polarization and how it is profoundly changing the way in which we live our lives. With hands-on reporting, Suarez explores the attitudes and beliefs of the people behind the voting numbers, the places in which these new beliefs are being born, and how the political divide is manifesting itself across the country. The reader will come to a greater understanding of how Americans believe, and how this belief structure fuels the debates that dominate the issues on our evening news.",

Thomas's latest case is prosecuting Moses Bol, a Sudanese refugee who faces the death penalty for killing a white woman in the Nations, a notorious, racially charged part of town. Bol's conviction seems certain, until a university professor claims Thomas sent the wrong man to the death chamber in a previous case. The DA' s office is rocked to its core, but within days another blow falls: a beautiful and brilliant anti-death penalty activist mysteriously surfaces as Bol's alibi, claiming she was with him at the time of the crime. Bol's case becomes a lightning rod as protesters on all sides converge on Nashville and tensions threaten to explode.Meanwhile, Bol's alibi has her own secrets -- and is terrified of someone working behind the scenes to get what he wants -- even if it means murder.Will Dennehy be able to piece things together before everything he believes about the law, and about justice, is torn apart?Vivid with the emotional complexity that has become the hallmark of Reed Arvin's work,Blood of Angels is filled with nonstop action, impeccable detail, and unforgettable characters, making this a novel that is impossible to resist.",

Each time . . . the lifeless body [of an al-Qaida terrorist] would snap back through the desert air and drop onto the sandy courtyard.\u201dThe war in Afghanistan was the most secret conflict since the CIA\u2019s covert war in Laos; thousands of journalists covered it, yet, ironically, little is known about how it was waged or what really happened\u2014until now.The Hunt for bin Laden plunges the reader into America\u2019s War on Terror, from the first top-secret meetings of TASK FORCE DAGGER in Tampa on the afternoon of September 11, 2001, through the liberation of Kabul sixty-two days later and the tragedies of OPERATION ANACONDA. The book takes the reader into the heat of battle\u2014as seen through the eyes of the Green Berets on the ground. This is the story of how only a few hundred men, operating from a secret Special Forces base, changed the course of history in Central Asia and destroyed a hundred-thousand-man terrorist army in less than ninety days.Action-packed and controversial, The Hunt for bin Laden is teeming with revelations and inside information: the truth about John Walker Lindh and Mike Spann; the failure of the \u201cconventional\u201d generals; the courage of the Northern Alliance; the wounding and murder of journalists; and the flaws and frustrations of the hunt for bin Laden himself.In mid-December 2001, Robin Moore arrived in Afghanistan, where he joined his old friends, whom he had celebrated thirty-five years earlier in his book The Green Berets  and who were now calling in airstrikes and fighting alongside the armies of the Northern Alliance against the terrorist al-Qaida and Taliban. In less than three winter months, about a hundred Green Berets accounted for the deaths of perhaps as many as forty thousand terrorists and the winning of a war in Afghanistan\u2014where the Soviets had found fighting a war all but impossible.",

        "Title": "Not Out Of Africa: How \"\"Afrocentrism\"\" Became An Excuse To Teach Myth As History",
        "Authors": "By Lefkowitz, Mary",
        "Description": "Was Socrates black? Did Aristotle steal his ideas from the library in Alexandria? Do we owe the underlying tenets of our democratic civilization to the Africans? Hardly a week goes by when an article does not appear in a newspaper or magazine by an Afrocentrist writer making such allegations. But so far, no one has responded fully to these Afrocentrist claims or explained why these strange ideas are being circulated, and indeed taught, in American schools and universities.Not Out of Africa is the first book to refute these spurious claims. Mary Lefkowitz examines the ancient evidence and shows how it was misunderstood both in antiquity and in modern time. She explains how we know that Socrates and Cleopatra were Greeks and that Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers did not steal their ideas from Egyptian sources. Lefkowitz, a distinguished classicist, demonstrates that there has been no modern conspiracy among scholars to conceal the debt of Greece to Egypt and that some of the misconceptions arise form the ancient Greeks' own misunderstanding of Egyptian religions.Not Out of Africa explains why revisionist histories of the ancient world are being written now - and perhaps always will be. Modern Afrocentric writers are following a long-established pattern in which peoples, particularly if they regard themselves as having been deprived of a history, seem keen to acquire a glorious past.Lefkowitz explains how the notion that Greek religion and philosophy were derived from Egypt was preserved in the ritual and mythology of Freemasonry, and how extreme Afrocentrists came to allege that what they supposed to be an Egyptian legacy was not just borrowed but actually stolen by the ancient Greeks.This book will be of interest to everyone who cares about the ancient world and its traditions, and to all who believe that our civilization has preserved some of the Greeks' best traditions, such as democratic government, freedom of speech, learning, and discussion.",

Within the sanctuary walls of the cloistered convent, now stained with blood, lie two nuns\u2014one dead, one critically injured\u2014victims of an unspeakably savage attacker.The brutal crime appears to be without motive, and the elderly nuns in residence can offer little help in the police investigation. But medical examiner Maura Isles\u2019s autopsy of the dead woman yields a shocking surprise: Twenty-year-old Sister Camille, the order\u2019s sole novice, gave birth before she was murdered. Then the disturbing case takes a stunning new turn when another woman is found murdered in an abandoned building, her body mutilated beyond recognition.Together, Isles and homicide detective Jane Rizzoli uncover an ancient horror that connects these terrible slaughters. As long-buried secrets come to light, Maura Isles finds herself drawn inexorably toward the heart of an investigation that strikes closer and closer to home\u2014and toward a dawning revelation about the killer\u2019s identity too shattering to consider.As spine-tingling as it is mind-jolting, The Sinner showcases Tess Gerritsen in peak form\u2014bringing her intimate knowledge of the dark depths of criminal investigation brilliantly to bear. Beneath its layers of startling insight into the souls of its characters, and the richly wrought depiction of the everyday war between good and evil, beats the unstoppable heart of an irresistible thriller.Tess Gerritsen left a successful practice as an internist to raise her children and concentrate on her writing. She gained nationwide acclaim for her first novel of medical suspense, the New York Times bestseller Harvest.
