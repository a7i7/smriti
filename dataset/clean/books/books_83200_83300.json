Best remembered for laying his coat in a muddy puddle so that Queen Elizabeth I could walk across it, Sir Walter Ralegh committed himself to pleasing his monarch and obtaining power in her court. He heroically risked his life in battle time and again, chasing after glory to win her favor. His notoriously ill-fated quest for the mythological golden city of El Dorado was perhaps his grandest attempt, but it also was his undoing, and Ralegh ultimately paid for his mistakes with his life. Despite his shortcomings, he was not only charismatic and brave, he was brilliant as well, and his contributions to the New World and to western culture as a whole were vast and enduring.

But for his creator, &&LB&&RFord Madox Ford&&L/B&&R, he also represents the corruption at society\u2019s core. Beneath Ashburnham\u2019s charming, polished exterior lurks a soul well-versed in the arts of deception, hypocrisy, and betrayal. Throughout the nine years of his friendship with an equally privileged American, John Dowell, Ashburnham has been having an affair with Dowell\u2019s wife, Florence. Unlike Dowell, Ashburnham\u2019s own wife, Leonora, is well aware of it. &&LBR&&R&&LBR&&RWhen &&LI&&RThe Good Soldier&&L/I&&R was first published in 1915, its pitiless portrait of an amoral society dedicated to its own pleasure and convinced of its own superiority outraged many readers.

        "Description": "In the spring of 1946, following the defeat of Hitler\u2019s Germany, America found itself still struggling with the subtler but no less insidious tyrannies of racism and segregation at home. In the midst of it all, Jackie Robinson, a full year away from breaking major league baseball\u2019s color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers, was undergoing a harrowing dress rehearsal for integration\u2014his first spring training as a minor league prospect with the Montreal Royals, Brooklyn\u2019s AAA team. In Blackout, Chris Lamb tells what happened during these six weeks in segregated Florida\u2014six weeks that would become a critical juncture for the national pastime and for an American society on the threshold of a civil rights revolution. Blackout chronicles Robinson\u2019s tremendous ordeal during that crucial spring training\u2014how he struggled on the field and off. The restaurants and hotels that welcomed his white teammates were closed to him, and in one city after another he was prohibited from taking the field. Steeping his story in its complex cultural context, Lamb describes Robinson\u2019s determination and anxiety, the reaction of the black and white communities to his appearance, and the unique and influential role of the press\u2014mainstream reporting, the alternative black weeklies, and the Communist Daily Worker\u2014in the integration of baseball. Told here in detail for the first time, this story brilliantly encapsulates the larger history of a man, a sport, and a nation on the verge of great and enduring change.",

        "Description": "The next president, whether Democrat or Republican, will face the daunting task of repairing America's core relationships and tarnished credibility after the damage caused during the past seven years. In Memo to the President Elect, former secretary of state and bestselling author Madeleine Albright offers provocative ideas about how to confront the striking array of challenges that the next commander-in-chief will face and how to return America to its rightful role as a source of inspiration across the globe.Much more than a set of policy prescriptions, Secretary Albright's writing blends lessons from the past with forward-looking suggestions about how to assemble a first-rate foreign policy team, anticipate the actions of other key countries, make full use of presidential power without repeating the excesses of the Bush administration, and revive America's commitment to its founding ideals.Albright's advice is candid\u2014as conveyed in a confidential memo\u2014and seasoned with humor and stories from her years in office. Drawing on her extensive experience as an advisor to two presidents and a key figure in four presidential transitions, she provides an insider's analysis of U.S. options in addressing the decisive issues of our era: terrorism, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rivalries in the Middle East, the potential for nuclear war, and headaches created by such troublesome leaders as Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Russia's Vladimir Putin, Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and North Korea's Kim Jong-il.The 2008 election promises to be one of the most dramatic in our nation's history. Memo to the President Elect offers indispensable guidance for the next occupant of the White House\u2014and a wealth of insights for voters to think about before deciding who that person will be.",
