        "Title": "The Hounds and the Fury: A Novel (\"Sister\" Jane)",
        "Authors": "By Brown, Rita Mae",
        "Description": "Critics and fans alike are wild about Rita Mae Brown\u2019s richly imagined and utterly  engaging foxhunting mysteries\u2013and this latest novel promises more thrilling hunts,  breathtaking vistas, and an all-new sinister scandal.  Millions of dollars seem  to be missing after a long-overdue audit of the local aluminum plant reveals a major  accounting discrepancy. Company president Garvey Stokes finds himself at a loss\u2013in  more ways than one. He turns to his sharp-tongued, ornery bookkeeper, Iphigenia \u201cIffy\u201d  Demetrios, for an explanation, but she\u2019s no help. Yet when the fuzzy math suddenly  includes a body count, the figures can no longer be ignored.  While the town sheriff  tries to get to the bottom of the matter, leave it to \u201cSister\u201d Jane Arnold, venerable  master of the Jefferson Hunt Club, to rely on her keen horse-and-hound sense to follow  the trail of murder and cover-up. Throwing her off the scent, however, is former  hunt club donor and all-around cad Crawford Howard, who thinks he can go toe-to-toe  with the beloved septuagenarian and outclass her club by grossly sidestepping hound-  and-hunt etiquette. Against the backdrop of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a menagerie  of friends, foes, and fresh new faces saddle up for the breakneck ride to unravel  the conspiracy. Even the furry denizens in the fields and boroughs have a thing or  two to say about these peculiar humans. Incomparable author Rita Mae Brown returns  to the glorious hills of Virginia and its genteel foxhunting society, where how much  money you have in the bank is not nearly as important as how long your family has  lived on the land\u2013and where nearly everyone has something to hide. As Sister muses,  \u201cThe little secrets leak out. The big ones, well, some escape like evils from Pandora\u2019s box. And others we\u2019ll never know.\u201d",

What will delight his numerous fans and surprise many others is the humor and self-deprecation with which he handles one of his core subjects: himself, and just how O\u2019Reilly became O\u2019Reilly.",

Drink lots of coffee and ask them what to do. Do your best to listen to their advice but don't necessarily follow it.Start to work in Washington, D.C. Start to date. Make friends. Fail up. Develop a career as a job doula. Teach nursery school and Sunday School.Watch your daughter grow. When she's a teenager, just when you're both getting comfortable, uproot her and move to Chicago to take a job writing a nationally syndicated advice column.Do your best to replace a legend. Date some more.Love fiercely. Laugh with abandon. Grab your second chance -- and your third, and your fourth.Send your daughter to college. Cry for five more weeks.Move back again to your dinky hometown and the women who helped raise you.Find love, finally.And take care.Amy",

        "Authors": "By McLaren, Brian D., McManus, Erwin Raphael, Mathewes-Green, Frederica, Sweet, Leonard (EDT), Crouch, Andy (EDT), and Horton, Michael",
        "Description": "What should the church look like today? What should be the focus of its message? How should I present that message? We live in as pivotal and defining an age as the Great Depression or the Sixties\u2013a period whose definition, say some cultural observers, includes a warning of the church\u2019s influence. The result? A society measurably less religious but decidedly more spiritual. Less influenced by authority than by experience. More attuned to images than to words. How does the church adapt to such a culture? Or should it, in fact, eschew adapting for maintaining a course it has followed these last two millennia? Or something in between? These are exactly the questions asked in The Church In Emerging Culture by five Christian thinker-speaker-writers, each who advocate unique stances regarding what the church\u2019s message should be (and what methods should be used to present it) as it journeys through this evolving, postmodern era. The authors are: Andy Crouch\u2013Re:Generation Quarterly editor-in-chief Michael Horton\u2013professor and reformed theologian Frederica Mathewes-Green\u2013author, commentator, and Orthodox Christian Brian D. McLaren\u2013postmodernist, author, pastor, and Emergent senior fellow Erwin Raphael McManus\u2013author and pastor of the innovative and interethnic L.A.-based church, Mosaic Most unique about their individual positions is that they\u2019re presented not as singular essays but as lively discussions in which the other four authors freely (and frequently) comment, critique, and concur. That element, coupled with a unique photographic design that reinforces the depth of their at-once congenial and feisty conversation, gives you all-access entr\u00e9e into this groundbreaking discourse. What\u2019s more, general editor Leonard Sweet (author of SoulTsunami and AquaChurch, among several other acclaimed texts) frames the thought-provoking dialogue with a profoundly insightful, erudite introductory essay\u2013practically a book within a book. The Church In Emerging Culture is foundational reading for leaders and serious students of all denominations and church styles.",

But when their relationship began to fall apart, a miraculous vision became the beginning of a pilgrimage that would lead these two non-believers into a deep and lasting relationship with each other-and with Jesus Christ. Finding God, Finding Each Other is the story of how God intervened miraculously to transform them and helped them create a loving and lasting marriage relationship. This love story not only chronicles the spiritual journeys of Linda and Vincent Ruhl, but also reveals biblical principles of individual character change, relational transformation, and how a broken marriage relationship can be redeemed and made whole.",

Neither Debbie Cuevas nor her boyfriend, Mark Brewster, gave much thought to the white pickup truck that had pulled up beside them on the riverfront. Until . . . a revolver thrust through the driver\u2019s window . . . a hand jerked Debbie\u2019s head back and a voice said, \"Don\u2019t do anything stupid\" . . . and a quiet Friday evening abruptly became a nightmare. For the first time, here is the untold other half of Dead Man Walking, the movie that depicted killer Robert Willie\u2019s death-row relationship with spiritual advisor Helen Prejean. Now the woman whose testimony helped send Willie to the electric chair tells her side of the story--the side America hasn\u2019t heard. In gripping detail, Debbie Morris--formerly Debbie Cuevas--recounts her hours of terror . . . and her years of walking an agonizing road back to wholeness. More than a riveting narrative, here is an incredible tale of courage, faith, and forgiveness. In a world where all of us struggle sooner or later with unforgiveness, Debbie Morris is a living testimony to the grace we long for: grace that shines more brightly than we dare believe, bright enough to triumph over the darkest evil.",

A form kept in close secrecy for millennia is now revealed for the first time in this practical and dynamic guidebook. The teachings focus on cultivating the powers of the individual's mind, the harmony of movements, and the discovery of internal potentialities as the ultimate force of self-healing to extend one's lifetime.Comparable to a cross between yoga and tai chi, this ancient Tibetan system is designed to increase vitality, balance, and Inner Energy. The Secret Art consists of slow and fluid movements that improve coordination and strengthen equilibrium between body and mind through various breathing and movement techniques. In particular, Seamm-Jasani is known for its combination of relaxation, active motion, and breathing exercises.",

        "Authors": "By Stauber, John C. and Rampton, Sheldon",
        "Description": "The authors of Toxic Sludge Is Good for You! unmask the sneaky and widespread methods industry uses to influence opinion through bogus experts, doctored data, and manufactured facts. We count on the experts. We count on them to tell us who to vote for, what to eat, how to raise our children. We watch them on TV, listen to them on the radio, read their opinions in magazine and newspaper articles and letters to the editor. We trust them to tell us what to think, because there\u2019s too much information out there and not enough hours in a day to sort it all out.We should stop trusting them right this second.In their new book Trust Us, We\u2019re Experts!: How Industry Manipulates Science and Gambles with Your Future, Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber, authors of Toxic Sludge Is Good For You, offer a chilling expos\u00e9 on the manufacturing of \"independent experts.\"Public relations firms and corporations know well how to exploit your trust to get you to buy what they have to sell: Let you hear it from a neutral third party, like a professor or a pediatrician or a soccer mom or a watchdog group. The problem is, these third parties are usually anything but neutral. They have been handpicked, cultivated, and meticulously packaged in order to make you believe what they have to say\u2014preferably in an \"objective\" format like a news show or a letter to the editor. And in some cases, they have been paid handsomely for their \"opinions.\"For example:You think that nonprofit organizations just give away their stamps of approval on products? Bristol-Myers Squibb paid $600,000 to the American Heart Association for the right to display AHA\u2019s name and logo in ads for its cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol. SmithKline Beecham paid the American Cancer Society $1 million for the right to use its logo in ads for Beecham\u2019s Nicoderm CQ and Nicorette anti-smoking ads.You think that a study out of a prestigious university is completely unbiased? In 1997, Georgetown University\u2019s Credit Research Center issued a study which concluded that many debtors are using bankruptcy as an excuse to wriggle out of their obligations to creditors. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen cited the study in a Washington Times column and advocated for changes in federal law to make it harder for consumers to file for bankruptcy relief. What Bentsen failed to mention was that the Credit Research Center is funded in its entirety by credit card companies, banks, retailers, and others in the credit industry; that the study itself was produced with a $100,000 grant from VISA USA, Inc. and MasterCard International; and that Bentsen himself had been hired to work as a credit-industry lobbyist.You think that all grassroots organizations are truly grassroots? In 1993, a group called Mothers Opposing Pollution (MOP) appeared, calling itself \"the largest women\u2019s environmental group in Australia, with thousands of supporters across the country.\" Their cause: A campaign against plastic milk bottles. It turned out that the group\u2019s spokesperson, Alana Maloney, was in truth a woman named Janet Rundle, the business partner of a man who did P.R. for the Association of Liquidpaperboard Carton Manufacturers\u2014the makers of paper milk cartons.You think that if a scientist says so, it must be true? In the early 1990s, tobacco companies secretly paid thirteen scientists a total of $156,000 to write a few letters to influential medical journals. One biostatistician received $10,000 for writing a single, eight-paragraph letter that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A cancer researcher received $20,137 for writing four letters and an opinion piece to the Lancet, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, and The Wall Street Journal.Rampton and Sta...",

        "Description": "The attacks of September 11, 2001, were accomplished through an amazing orchestration of logistics and personnel. Crossing the Rubicon discovers and identifies key suspects\u2014finding some of them in the highest echelons of American government\u2014by showing how they acted in concert to guarantee that the attacks produced the desired result.Crossing the Rubicon is unique not only for its case-breaking examination of 9/11, but for the breadth and depth of its world picture\u2014an interdisciplinary analysis of petroleum, geopolitics, narcotraffic, intelligence and militarism\u2014without which 9/11 cannot be understood.The US manufacturing sector has been mostly replaced by speculation on financial data whose underlying economic reality is a dark secret. Hundreds of billions of dollars in laundered drug money flow through Wall Street each year from opium and coca fields maintained by CIA-sponsored warlords and US-backed covert paramilitary violence. America\u2019s global dominance depends on a continually turning mill of guns, drugs, oil and money. Oil and natural gas\u2014the fuels that make economic growth possible\u2014are subsidized by American military force and foreign lending.In reality, 9/11 and the resulting \u201cwar on terror\u201d are parts of a massive authoritarian response to an emerging economic crisis of unprecedented scale. Peak Oil\u2014the beginning of the end for our industrial civilization\u2014is driving the \u00e9lites of American power to implement unthinkably draconian measures of repression, warfare and population control. Crossing the Rubicon is more than a story. It is a map of the perilous terrain through which, together and alone, we are all now making our way.Michael C. Ruppert is the publisher and editor of From the Wilderness, a newsletter read by more than 16,000 subscribers in 40 countries. A former Los Angeles Police Department narcotics investigator, he is widely known for his groundbreaking stories on US involvement in the drug trade, Peak Oil and 9/11.",

It takes only a few minutes, requires no medication and no talk therapy, and can completely erase a full range of negative emotions?from phobia, to trauma, to performance anxiety?in just a single session. In The Tapping Cure Dr. Temes, a seasoned psychotherapist, teaches readers how to tap themselves to eradicate their own symptoms. It is the first book of its kind to give precise instructions on where the tapping should occur?e.g., on the collarbone, under the eye, on the pinky?without resorting to mystical explanations, unscientific paradigms, and complicated pseudo-psychoanalytic rationalizations. The Tapping Cure is sure to help a great many people?psychological sufferers, the worried-well, and therapists with increasing numbers of patients requesting the treatment, which is fast becoming known in mainstream circles just like other once fringe therapies before it.",

Stories feature Paprika, the kitten that may have saved a little Hungarian girl from Russian soldiers; the cat who helped a woman make friends in a hostile workplace; the cats who acted as \"pacemakers\" for a sleeping woman with undiagnosed heart problems; and many more. Interwoven with the stories are brief meditations as well as fun facts about cats, such as that cats purr at the same frequency that increases bone density and strengthens and heals fractures. An \"Ask Cuddles\" section answers frequently asked questions about the fabulous feline.",

In Jefferson's Secrets, Andrew Burstein draws on sources previous biographers have glossed over or missed entirely. Beginning with Jefferson's last days, Burstein shows how Jefferson confronted his own mortality. Burstein also tackles the crucial questions history has yet to answer: Did Jefferson love Sally Hemings? What were his attitudes towards women? Did he believe in God? How did he wish to be remembered? The result is a profound and nuanced portrait of the most complex of the Founding Fathers.",
