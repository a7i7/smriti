        "Description": "Jack and Jill went down the hill - and are suing the pail manufacturer for pain and suffering. The mobster known as the Big Bad Wolf, nemesis of little pigs and grandmas everywhere, faces indictment under the RICO Act. Snow White, in violation of the kingdom's nondiscrimination laws, is given forty-five days to hire nonmale, non-Caucasian, nonvertically challenged employees. And guess who the Three Bears are taking to the cleaners for trespassing, damage to real property, and mental anguish...Way beyond the politically correct, this is the perfect book for these litigious times. From the Emperor's New Clothes to the Old Lady Who Lived in a Shoe... from Pinocchio to Humpty Dumpty ... from Hansel and Gretel to Beauty and the Beast ... the most beloved tales of childhood are told once again, not with the rhythms of the nursery, but in the precise language of the law, as depositions and briefs, summonses and summary judgments.The court finds Legally Correct Fairy Tales hilarious.",

        "Description": "The epic of Chicago is the story of the emergence of modern America. Here, witness Chicago's growth from a desolate fur-trading post in the 1830s to one of the world's most explosively alive cities by 1900.Donald Miller's powerful narrative embraces it all: Chicago's wild beginnings, its reckless growth, its natural calamities (especially the Great Fire of 1871), its raucous politics, its empire-building businessmen, its world-transforming architecture, its rich mix of cultures, its community of young writers and journalists, and its staggering engineering projects\u2014which included the reversal of the Chicago River and raising the entire city from prairie mud to save it from devastating cholera epidemics. The saga of Chicago's unresolved struggle between order and freedom, growth and control, capitalism and community, remains instructive for our time, as we seek ways to build and maintain cities that retain their humanity without losing their energy. City of the Century throbs with the pulse of the great city it brilliantly brings to life.",

Schaller also includes comments on the formulation of a workable denominational strategy for church growth.  No church exists in complete isolations from all other churches, notes Schaller, \"although thousands of congregations appear not to believe it.\"Effectively using an informative case-history approach to outlining church-growth strategies, Schaller works from several basic assumptions.  Visitation evangelism is the ideal method of obtaining new members, he says, but it is not always appropriate.  He warns of the tendency of long-established congregations to attract \"new\" members from other churches...\"the circulation of the saints.\"Schaller also assumes that every church's approach to growth will rest on a foundation of its values, goals, dreams, prejudices, assumptions, interpretations of reality, theological perspectives, and understanding of the biblical imperative.  It is good, says Schaller, for Christians to be members of congregations; it is good for congregations to receive new members; and it is good for denominations to grow in numbers.",

        "Description": "In Saga of Chief Joseph, Helen Addison Howard has written the definitive biography of the great Nez Perce chief, a diplomat among warriors. In times of war and peace, Chief Joseph exhibited gifts of the first rank. Even though he was a leader for peace and tribal liberty, he was destined to see the defeat of his people in the Nez Perce War of 1877 and the loss of all that was important to them\u2014their lands, their horses, and their independence. The struggle of the Nez Perces for the freedom they considered paramount in life constitutes one of the most dramatic episodes of Indian history.\u00a0This completely revised edition of the author's earlier War Chief Joseph presents in exciting detail the full story of Chief Joseph, with a reevaluation of the five bands engaged in the Nez Perce War, objectively told from the Indian, the white military, and the settlers' points of view. Especially valuable is the reappraisal, based on significant new material from Indian sources, of Joseph as a war leader. Of War Chief Joseph, reviewers said: \"A priceless contribution to the history of a great and noble race\" (Los Angeles Times); \"A stirring and dramatic biography of a great man (Montreal Star); \"This work . . . is a standard in the field\" (Choice Books for College Libraries).",

Perceived as a swarming mixture of greed, glitz, riots, earthquakes, and paper-thin illusions, the city has become a focus for all our national ills. This is not new. For two centuries critics have sharpened their claws on this flawed paradise, and we are still fascinated by its glamour and its darker sides, to say nothing of the nightmarish earthquakes - vividly described here - that ushered LA into 1994 with a brutal jolt.Peter Theroux introduces us to the physical side of LA, taking in the prehistoric La Brea Tar Pits, once the haunt of mastodons and dire wolves, now with pride of place on Wilshire Boulevard; the memorable official tour of Beverly Hills; the paradox of upscale Santa Monica, mecca for the homeless; and a hundred other geographical oddities from the oceanic suburbia of Long Beach to the Casablanca artifacts of the San Fernando Valley.As a journalist, translator, and literacy tutor, Theroux is immersed in many of LA's new and old communities: African Americans, now a minority in historically black Watts; Middle Easterners of all descriptions, who have found an alternative desert kingdom in this capital of the extreme west; and Latinos, the original conquerors now returning as immigrants.In a city famous for its lack of a physical center, Theroux finds the human centers that matter, from Hollywood to Burbank to South-Central to LA's amazing theme park cemeteries, and vividly translates the everyday lives of the people who call LA home.",

It is a beautifully produced book, and it boasts more than thirty specially made color maps, with those depicting the individual appellations drawn in such exquisite detail that each and every vineyard is visible.Burgundy is a fitting monument to the region that is capable of producing, in Parker\u201ds words, \u201cthe world\u2019s most majestic, glorious, and hedonistic red and white wine.\u201d",

        "Description": "\u201cWANTED. YOUNG, SKINNY, WIRY FELLOWS. NOT OVER 18. MUST BE EXPERT RIDERS. WILLING TO RISK DEATH DAILY. ORPHANS PREFERRED.\u201d \u2014California newspaper help-wanted ad, 1860 The Pony Express is one of the most celebrated and enduring chapters in the history of the United States, a story of the all-American traits of bravery, bravado, and entrepreneurial risk that are part of the very fabric of the Old West. No image of the American West in the mid-1800s is more familiar, more beloved, and more powerful than that of the lone rider galloping the mail across hostile Indian territory. No image is more revered. And none is less understood. Orphans Preferred is both a revisionist history of this magnificent and ill-fated adventure and an entertaining look at the often larger-than-life individuals who created and perpetuated the myth of \u201cthe Pony,\u201d as it is known along the Pony Express trail that runs from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California. The Pony Express is a story that exists in the annals of Americana where fact and fable collide, a story as heroic as the journey of Lewis and Clark, as complex and revealing as the legacy of Custer\u2019s Last Stand, and as muddled and freighted with yarns as Paul Revere\u2019s midnight ride. Orphans Preferred is a fresh and exuberant reexamination of this great American story.",

        "Description": "In the early morning hours of June 6, tens of thousands of boys from the shores of Maine, the rivers of Mississippi, and the lakes of Minnesota were taking a boat ride that would go down in history. With the ocean spray in their faces and hearts practically beating out of their chests, American G.I.s peers through the mist and saw the beaches of France. The Allied invasion of Hitlers Europe was on!A skinny kid from Philly checked his rifle for the umpteenth time and swallowed hard. A strip of beach codenamed Utah lay just ahead....The 1944 D-Day landings preserved freedom all over the world and affected countless individual lives including G.I. Joe and his wife, Lillie.After the war, G.I. Joe and Lillie settled into a life that included two children. Old wounds, though, never quite let G.I. Joe leave France. Nightmares and crippling injuries left him with only one true friend, but she was all he'd ever need.Lillie embarked on a decades-long love affair, from the moment she saw that skinny boy from Philly in an army hospital. Five days of courtship and 55 years of marriage strengthened by faith saw to that. Lillie prayed daily for her husband and children in the difficult years ahead. Together, they made it all the way home.In Lillie's America, it was sacrifice that preserved cherished freedoms, and loyalty kept families united and strong. Lillie's steadfast faith and heartfelt devotion is a lesson for our time.This story of patriotism, bravery abroad and at home, and most of all, deep commitment, sets in a gold frame the very essence of America. The story of G.I. Joe and Lillie helps us all remember that true love never, ever dies.",

Their subject is a thirty-nine-year-old Texas man convicted of murder and executed in 1993, who had willed his body to science and left that body in peak, unspoiled condition. Members of the Visible Human Project undertook the task of slicing the man's cadaver into one-millimeter layers and then scanning them into a computer. Finally, using the most advanced image-processing techniques, photojournalist/artist Alexander Tsiaras put this extraordinary information back together, creating a stunning work of art.Through enhanced, high-resolution color images, computer topography, and magnetic resonance imaging, you will demystify the chemistry of the everyday headache and the anatomy of the common cold. You will map the complexities of the sense of vision, meet your two brains, know what the nose knows, and explore the scaffolding of memory.Body Voyage is a revealing view of what we are. It is an unprecedented glimpse of how medicine is evolving into the next century.",

        "Description": "\"A detailed, scholarly, masterly book\u2026and yet the romance is still there.\" \u2014 Chicago TribuneBeacons of light along the shore have guided mariners for thousands of years \u2014 from the days when olive oil lamps burned on darkened hillsides to signal the location of ancient harbors, to modern times when automated stations sent out 350,000 candlepower beams that cut through darkness and fog.The present volume, the first full-scale study of the United States Lighthouse Service, is a celebration of these vanishing symbols of security. Written by a historian of the National Park Service, this book describes the founding and operation of over 200 famous lights located along U.S. coastal and inland waterways. Beginning with the Boston Light, first lit in 1716, this carefully researched yet romantic account takes readers to every notable light installation in the nation \u2014 from New England to Delaware; the South Atlantic to the Florida Keys; the Gulf Coast; San Diego to Cape Flattery; the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain as well as Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.An informative section on lighthouse administration tells of the station's early days \u2014 when local authorities attempted to operate them \u2014 and their eventual takeover in 1939 by the U.S. Coast Guard. Subsequent chapters describe the development of diverse illumination systems as well as the vast number of changes and technological advances that have occurred in lighthouse construction and maintenance over the past century. In addition to its wealth of technical data, Dr. Holland's fascinating volume also includes dramatic vignettes \u2014 about heroic rescues of wreck-strewn sailors and valiant efforts to keep the lights shining in the face of human violence and natural calamity.This vivid, fact-filled history, enhanced by exciting tales and colorful personalities, is abundantly illustrated by over 100 historic engravings, drawings, and photographs. It is a book that will be prized not only by marine historians and armchair adventurers but by anyone who has ever felt the lure and romance of lighthouses \u2014 the lonely sentinels by the sea that have played such a crucial role in the maritime history of America and other sea-faring nations.",

This country of mists and tranquil waters harbors a rare abundance of wildlife, as well as the last commercial sailing fleet in the United Statesthe famous skipjacks, or oyster-dredging boats. The bay and its rivers are home to isolated villages that preserve early colonial dialects; to historic plantations, such as Mount Vernon; and to considerable cities, including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Richmond.Beautifully photographed and written, Chesapeake Country tells the story of the bay in all its aspects: its waterscape and wildlife; its delicate ecology; its rich history as the seedbed of American liberty as well as American slavery; and its uncertain present, as the population of watermen who live by crabbing and oystering dwindles, and that of prosperous newcomers seeking a respite from city life grows. This new edition also discusses the future of the bay in the era of climate change and brings us up to date on the places and personalities that make the Chesapeake so unique.For those who live on the bay, Chesapeake Country is a celebration. For those who do not, it is an invitation to explore. And for everyone, it is a journey of discovery.",

        "Description": "In 2002, a Cambridge historian is found dead, floating down the river Cam, a glass prism in her hand, after researching a book about a series of suspicious circumstances surrounding Newton's appointment as a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1667. That year, two Fellows died by falling down staircases, apparently drunk; another died in a field, apparently drunk; and a fourth was expelled, having gone mad\u2013leaving vacancies for new appointments and paving the way for Newton\u2019s extraordinary scientific discoveries. When Lydia Brooke, at the request of her ex-lover, the historian\u2019s son, steps in to finish the book, strange shows of light begin to play on the walls, and papers disappear only to reappear elsewhere.  And when events escalate to murder, and Lydia\u2019s rekindled romance appears increasingly implicated in the danger, the present becomes entangled with the seventeenth century, with Isaac Newton at the center of the mystery.Filled with evocative descriptions of Cambridge, past and present, of seventeenth-century glassmaking, alchemy, the Great Plague, and Newton\u2019s scientific innovations, Ghostwalk centers on a real historical mystery that Rebecca Stott has uncovered, involving Newton\u2019s alchemy.  A riveting literary thriller, Ghostwalk is a rare debut that will change the way most of us think about scientific innovation, our perception of time, and the force of history.",

The land was bequeathed to her husband by a maternal grandmother he never knew, and the cabin has been abandoned for years.As she is welcomed into the rural community of Toms Brook, Kendra becomes curious about an heirloom lover's knot quilt, which is another piece of Isaac's unexplored past. The unusual quilt clearly has a story to tell, and Kendra is convinced that helping her husband connect with his roots might help him reconnect with her, as well.At first Isaac's reluctant visits to the cabin only underscore the difficulties in their marriage. But as circumstances force them to piece together a new relationship, Isaac discovers that the history of a family he's never known might hold the key to his future.As a passionate story of strength, loss and desperation unfolds, the secrets of two quilts are revealed and the threads of an unraveling marriage are secured. In the rich, evocative prose that earned high praise for Wedding Ring and Endless Chain, Emilie Richards crafts the third tale in the Shenandoah Album series, resonant with the power of love and family ties.",

Joe Kane's personal account of the first expedition to travel the entirety of the world's longest river is a riveting adventure in the tradition of Joseph Conrad, filled with death-defying encounters: with narco-traffickers and Sendero Luminoso guerrillas and nature at its most unforgiving. Not least of all, Running the Amazon shows a polyglot group of urbanized travelers confronting their wilder selves -- their fear and egotism, selflessness and courage.",

Not when his biggest investment is WorldCom.In A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market, best-selling author John Allen Paulos employs his trademark stories, vignettes, paradoxes, and puzzles to address every thinking reader's curiosity about the market--Is it efficient? Is it random? Is there anything to technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and other supposedly time-tested methods of picking stocks? How can one quantify risk? What are the most common scams? Are there any approaches to investing that truly outperform the major indexes?But Paulos's tour through the irrational exuberance of market mathematics doesn't end there. An unrequited (and financially disastrous) love affair with WorldCom leads Paulos to question some cherished ideas of personal finance. He explains why \"data mining\" is a self-fulfilling belief, why \"momentum investing\" is nothing more than herd behavior with a lot of mathematical jargon added, why the ever-popular Elliot Wave Theory cannot be correct, and why you should take Warren Buffet's \"fundamental analysis\" with a grain of salt.Like Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street, this clever and illuminating book is for anyone, investor or not, who follows the markets--or knows someone who does.",

In this, the first novel he appears in, Zen himself has been assigned to do some law bending. Officials in a  high government ministry want him to finger someone--anyone--for the murder of an eccentric billionaire, whose corrupt dealings enriched some of the most exalted figures in Italian politics.But Oscar Burolo's murder would seem to be not just unsolvable but impossible. The magnate was killed on a heavily fortified Sardinian estate, where every room was monitored by video cameras. Those cameras captured Burolo's grisly death, but not the face of his killer. And that same killer, elusive, implacable, and deranged, may now be stalking Zen. Inexorable in its suspense, superbly atmospheric, Vendetta is further proof of Dibdin's mastery of the crime novel.",

        "Title": "Licensed to Kill: Hired Guns in the War on Terror",
        "Authors": "By Pelton, Robert Young",
        "Description": "Robert Young Pelton first became aware of the phenomenon of hired guns in the War on Terror when he met a covert team of contractors on the Afghanistan/Pakistan border in the fall of 2003. Pelton soon embarked on a globe-spanning odyssey to penetrate and understand this shadowy world, ultimately delivering stunning insights into the way private soldiers are used.Enter a blood-soaked world of South African mercenaries and tribal fighters backed by ruthless financiers. Drop into Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone, strap on body armor, and take a daily high-speed ride with a doomed crew of security contractors who dodge car bombs and snipers just to get their charges to the airport. Share a drink in a chic hotel bar with wealthy owners of private armies who debate the best way to stay alive in war zones.Licensed to Kill spans four continents and three years, taking us inside the CIA\u2019s dirty wars; the brutal contractor murders in Fallujah and the Alamo-like sieges in Najaf and Al Kut; the Deep South contractor training camps where ex\u2013Special Operations soldiers and even small town cops learn the ropes; the contractor conventions where macho attendees swap bullet-punctuated tales and discuss upcoming gigs; and the grim Central African prison where contractors turned failed mercenaries pay a steep price.The United States has encouraged the use of the private sector in all facets of the War on Terror, placing contractors outside the bounds of functional legal constraints. With the shocking clarity that can come only from firsthand observation, Licensed to Kill painstakingly deconstructs the most controversial events and introduces the pivotal players. Most disturbingly, it shows that there are indeed thousands of contractors\u2014with hundreds more being produced every month\u2014who\u2019ve been given a license to kill, their services available to the highest bidder.",

        "Title": "Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer",
        "Authors": "By Swanson, James L.",
        "Description": "The murder of Abraham Lincoln set off the greatest manhunt in American history -- the pursuit and capture of John Wilkes Booth. From April 14 to April 26, 1865, the assassin led Union cavalry and detectives on a wild twelve-day chase through the streets of Washington, D.C., across the swamps of Maryland, and into the forests of Virginia, while the nation, still reeling from the just-ended Civil War, watched in horror and sadness.At the very center of this story is John Wilkes Booth, America's notorious villain. A Confederate sympathizer and a member of a celebrated acting family, Booth threw away his fame and wealth for a chance to avenge the South's defeat. For almost two weeks, he confounded the manhunters, slipping away from their every move and denying them the justice they sought.Based on rare archival materials, obscure trial transcripts, and Lincoln's own blood relics, Manhunt is a fully documented work, but it is also a fascinating tale of murder, intrigue, and betrayal. A gripping hour-by-hour account told through the eyes of the hunted and the hunters, this is history as you've never read it before.",

        "Description": "Buchanan, former U.S. treasurer and sister of former presidential nominee Pat Buchanan, takes Hillary Clinton to task in this unapologetically partisan biography. Buchanan outlines how Clinton's personality and character changed after she was elected to the Senate, casting mock sympathy as she goes: \"It must be a terrible thing to be as deeply insecure as Hillary. It has made her so incredibly susceptible to the ideas of others.\" Subsequent chapters criticize the senator's positions on hot-button issues, including healthcare, same-sex partnerships and the war in Iraq. Though Buchanan backs up many of her points with outside scholarship and Clinton's own interviews and records (both as senator and student), claims that Clinton \"accepts no responsibility\" and disregards \"even the most basic standards of behavior\" make this a sermon for the choir.",

        "Title": "So Wrong for So Long: How the Press, the Pundits--and the President--Failed on Iraq",
        "Authors": "By Mitchell, Greg, Galloway, Joseph L. (FRW), and Springsteen, Bruce (INT)",
        "Description": "It is often said that a free press is the watchdog of democracy, insuring that the conduct of our leaders is examined with a critical eye. This makes Greg Mitchell the watchdog of watchdogs, as tracking the performance of the media is his beat at Editor & Publisher, the influential magazine of the newspaper industry. Over the past five years, his weekly column \u201cPressing Issues,\u201d has intensely scrutinized the coverage of the Iraq war, the media\u2019s views of the credibility of the Bush Administration, and such related topics as 9/11, the war in Afghanistan, and the CIA Leak Case. Now, as the war in Iraq reaches its 5th anniversary, this first-ever collection, with more than 75 of Mitchell\u2019s columns, provides a unique history of the conflict, from the hyped WMD stories to the \u201csurge.\u201d Back in 2003, Mitchell was one of the few mainstream journalists to question the grounds for war. Today, Mitchell looks ahead at lessons for the future with an original introduction and connecting material that updates and unifies his original essays. From prescient early columns warning of a long, bloody war to Stephen Colbert\u2019s in-his-face mockery of President Bush to a piece titled \u201cNo Pat Answers in the Tillman Case,\u201d this book will appeal to press critics, bloggers, media professionals, teachers, students, and everyone concerned with how we got into Iraq and why we can\u2019t seem to get out. With more than 160,000 American troops still fighting there, debate over the war continues to rage on news and editorial pages from big city dailies to weekly papers in small towns. Against this controversial backdrop, Greg Mitchell is the one reporter examining all the coverage and taking the long view of the press\u2019s performance.",

        "Description": "In the fall of 1997, Michael Johnston went to the rural Mississippi Delta - the \"deep heart's core\" of the South - as a member of the Teach For America program to become an English teacher in one of the poorest districts in the nation. At Greenville High School, he would confront a racially divided world in which his African-American students had to struggle daily against a legacy of crippling poverty and the scourges of drug addiction and gang violence that ravaged their community. In the Deep Heart's Core tells the story of how Johnston reached out to inspire his teenage students with all the means at his disposal - from the language of the great poets, to the strategies of chess, to the vigor of athletics.But more important, In the Deep Heart's Core brings to life the students of Greenville High, their passion for learning and dreams of a better world. Their stories, by turns heartbreaking and hopeful, harrowing and uplifting, form the emotional center of this powerful book. A charismatic class clown races to complete his coursework as his window of opportunity for earning a diploma is quickly shutting. A record-breaking track star draws the attention of college coaches from across the nation, but his poor grades threaten to push him from the bright spotlight of local celebrity to the obscure twilight of failure. A teenage mother's devotion to her infant son sparks a renewed commitment for academic success and an unyielding determination for a better future. And a vocational student emerges to find his voice as a writer, before having to face a choice that will change the course of his life forever.",
