        "Description": "Kids love fast food. And the fast food industry definitely loves kids. It couldn\u2019t survive without them. Did you know that the biggest toy company in the world is McDonald\u2019s? It\u2019s true. In fact, one out of every three toys given to a child in the United States each year is from a fast food restaurant.Not only has fast food reached into the toy industry, it\u2019s moving into our schools. One out of every five public schools in the United States now serves brand name fast food. But do kids know what they\u2019re eating? Where do fast food hamburgers come from? And what makes those fries taste so good? When Eric Schlosser\u2019s best-selling book, Fast Food Nation, was published for adults in 2001, many called for his groundbreaking insight to be shared with young people. Now Schlosser, along with co-writer Charles Wilson, has investigated the subject further, uncovering new facts children need to know. In Chew On This, they share with kids the fascinating and sometimes frightening truth about what lurks between those sesame seed buns, what a chicken \u2018nugget\u2019 really is, and how the fast food industry has been feeding off children for generations.Featuring cover art by M. Wartella.",

She has come to demand better treatment for his tenants, to seek some compassion, a shred of decency from this dastardly rake whose reputation for sin and debauchery precedes him. Now, the erotic image of his powerful flesh only heightens her determination to make this wicked rogue accountable for his actions...One sealed with a kiss...Certainly no woman has ever dared to take John Clayton to task as though he is a naughty schoolboy, and no woman, especially one as enticing as Emma, ever has refused to be baited by his bold, assessing gaze. Instead she seems to look beneath his skin to see more than a scandalous rake. But this prim and proper Vicar's daughter leaves him speechless when she proposes a bargain worthy of his own insolence. In return for his kindness to others, she offers herself. Vowing to regain the upper hand, John brazenly sets out to introduce Emma into the art of love-heedless of the consequences to his own heart...",

It begins on the road to Damascus, in a moment graven on the consciousness of Western civilization: \"Saul, Saul,\" asks the voice of the crucified Jesus of Nazareth,\"why persecutest thou me?\" From this experience, and from the response of Saul of Tarsus, the Jewish merchant later known as Paul, springs the Christian Church as we know it today. For as A. N. Wilson, biographer of Tolstoy, C. S. Lewis, and Jesus, makes clear in this astonishing and gripping narrative, Christianity without Paul is quite literally nothing. Jesus, with the layers of exegesis, scholarship, and ceremony stripped away, is a Jew, a fastidious and fervent Jew, who would lead his followers into a stricter, purer observance of Judaism. It is Paul who will claim divinity for him, who will transform him into the Messiah, center of an entirely new religion. And it is Paul who will negotiate the dangerous political currents of the Roman Empire, traveling everywhere, making converts, writing the great epistles that define our understanding of Christ and of the sublime paradoxes of his teaching, defusing the natural antagonism of the supreme temporal power to this dangerous spiritual force, Christianity, which would in time consume that empire from within. What drove Paul? What fueled this act of inspired creativity? What would he think of what his church has become?",

He opens their eyes to new possibilities and invites them to think freshly about future technology. He challenges developers to build products that better support human needs and that are usable at any bandwidth. Shneiderman proposes Leonardo da Vinci as an inspirational muse for the \"new computing.\" He wonders how Leonardo would use a laptop and what applications he would create.Shneiderman shifts the focus from what computers can do to what users can do. A key transformation is to what he calls \"universal usability,\" enabling participation by young and old, novice and expert, able and disabled. This transformation would empower those yearning for literacy or coping with their limitations. Shneiderman proposes new computing applications in education, medicine, business, and government. He envisions a World Wide Med that delivers secure patient histories in local languages at any emergency room and thriving million-person communities for e-commerce and e-government. Raising larger questions about human relationships and society, he explores the computer's potential to support creativity, consensus-seeking, and conflict resolution. Each chapter ends with a Skeptic's Corner that challenges assumptions about trust, privacy, and digital divides.",

The dashing cad has a well-earned reputation for carousing that brings a blush to checks, but more distressing still I is the unwanted desire he arouses in her!To win a wager, Alex must win a kiss from an innocent maiden, But first he must get past the giggly girl's chaperone-her straitlaced older sister, Lady Emmeline. And to his dismay, it is the enchanting, levelheaded Emmeline who intoxicates him with her soft sensuality and eminently kissable lips. Yet such a conquest is unthinkable-unless Alex abandons his cherished reprobate ways... and surrenders to his heart's traitorous yearning for a true and passionate love.",

September 2003; it's six months after the US-led invasion, and the country is in anarchy - the infrastructure has collapsed, terrorist attacks have begun and the coalition has decided to rule directly via the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). Rory Stewart, a young British diplomat, is appointed as the coalition deputy governor (CPA deputy governorate coordinator) of a province of 850,000 people in the southern marshland. There, in the cities of Amara and then Nasiriyah, he and his colleagues confront gangsters, Iranian-linked politicians, tribal vendettas and a full Islamist insurgency, in which Stewart is besieged in his compound under continual fire, struggling to keep his staff alive. They negotiate hostage releases, appoint Iraqi governors and police chiefs, patch up the shattered infrastructure and, in June 2004, hand over sovereignty to the Iraqi government.Stewart's almost colonial role may never exist again. His insider's account reveals a side of Iraq hidden from most foreign journalists and soldiers and raises questions about the whole project of 'state-building' in the twenty-first century.",

He was her own age -- and cute. Why hadn't she studied her history? Sam only knew that Edward had died at about sixteen -- and she was determined to save him. He seemed to expect her. He called her \"my sweet angel.\" She should have recognized the danger when the scheming Duke of Northumberland tried to come between them. But Edward protected her --  especially as the ailing young king grew healthy, and rumors of marriage began. She thought she was safe -- until a handsome young stranger stole her heart and swept her into the middle of deadly sixteenth-century court intrigue....Could she ever go home again?",

        "Title": "The United States of Arugula: How We Became a Gourmet Nation",
        "Authors": "By Kamp, David",
        "Description": "One day we woke up and realized that our \u201cmacaroni\u201d had become \u201cpasta,\u201d that our Wonder Bread had been replaced by organic whole wheat, that sushi was fast food, and that our tomatoes were heirlooms. How did all this happen, and who made it happen? The United States of Arugula is the rollicking, revealing chronicle of how gourmet eating in America went from obscure to pervasive, thanks to the contributions of some outsized, opinionated iconoclasts who couldn\u2019t abide the status quo.Vanity Fair writer David Kamp chronicles this amazing transformation, from the overcooked vegetables and scary gelatin salads of yore to our current heyday of free-range chickens, extra-virgin olive oil, Iron Chef, Whole Foods, Starbucks, and that breed of human known as the \u201cfoodie.\u201d In deft fashion, Kamp conjures up vivid images of the \u201cBig Three,\u201d the lodestars who led us out of this culinary wilderness: James Beard, the hulking, bald, flamboyant Oregonian who made the case for American cookery; Julia Child, the towering, warbling giantess who demystified French cuisine for Americans; and Craig Claiborne, the melancholy, sexually confused Mississippian who all but invented food journalism at the New York Times. The story continues onward with candid, provocative commentary from the food figures who prospered in the Big Three\u2019s wake: Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower of Berkeley\u2019s Chez Panisse, Wolfgang Puck and his L.A. acolytes, the visionary chefs we know by one name (Emeril, Daniel, Mario, Jean-Georges), the \u201cWilliams\u201d in Williams-Sonoma, the \u201cNiman\u201d in Niman Ranch, both Dean and DeLuca, and many others.A rich, frequently uproarious stew of culinary innovation, flavor revelations, balsamic pretensions, taste-making luminaries, food politics, and kitchen confidences, The United States of Arugula is the remarkable history of the cultural success story of our era.",
