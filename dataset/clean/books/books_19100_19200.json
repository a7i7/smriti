Spanning roughly 500 years, the dwellings reveal a remarkable variety of styles and approaches. Noted illustrator A. G. Smith has rendered over forty extant structures in crisp, detailed drawings. Ranging from the Taos Pueblo (New Mexico, pre-sixteenth century) to a striking contemporary design by John Milnes Baker, the houses represent a host of native and European-inspired styles: Spanish Colonial Revival, Georgian, High-Victorian Gothic, Italianate, Second Empire, Stick Style, Richardson Romanesque, Beaux-Arts Classical, Prairie, and many others. Rich, informative captions date and identify each house as well as describing important architectural features, methods, and materials of construction and historical background, and showing how Old World architectural styles were adapted and modified in America. In addition to many hours of coloring fun, this book offers students, cultural historians, and Americana\u00a0enthusiasts a step-by-step overview of the evolution of American architecture \u2014 from its primitive origins to the technologically sophisticated homes of today.",

        "Description": "If you care about the education of a child, you need this book. Comprehensive and easy to use, it will inform, empower, and encourage you.  Just as William J. Bennett's The Book of Virtues has helped millions of Americans teach young people about character, The Educated Child delivers what you need to take control. With coauthors Chester E. Finn, Jr., and John T. E. Cribb, Jr., former Secretary of Education Bennett provides the indispensable guide.  Championing a clear \"back-to-basics\" curriculum that will resonate with parents and teachers tired of fads and jargon, The Educated Child supplies an educational road map from earliest childhood to the threshold of high school. It gives parents hundreds of practical suggestions for helping each child succeed while showing what to look for in a good school and what to watch out for in a weak one.  The Educated Child places you squarely at the center of your young one's academic career and takes a no-nonsense view of your responsibilities. It empowers you as mothers and fathers, enabling you to reclaim what has been appropriated by \"experts\" and the education establishment. It out-lines questions you will want to ask, then explains the answers -- or non-answers -- you will be given. No longer will you feel powerless before the education \"system.\" The tools and advice in this guide put the power where it belongs -- in the hands of those who know and love their children best.  Using excerpts from E. D. Hirsch's Core Knowledge Sequence, The Educated Child sets forth a state-of-the art curriculum from kindergarten through eighth grade that you can use to monitor what is and isn't being taught in your school. It outlines how you can help teachers ensure that your child masters the most important skills and knowledge. It takes on today's education controversies from phonics to school choice, from outcomes-based education to teaching values, from the education of gifted children to the needs of the disabled. Because much of a youngster's education takes place outside the school, The Educated Child also distills the essential information you need to prepare children for kindergarten and explains to the parents of older students how to deal with such challenges as television, drugs, and sex.  If you seek high standards and solid, time-tested content for the child you care so much about, if you want the unvarnished truth about what parents and schools must do, The Educated Child is the one book you need on your shelf.",

Earth and its former colony worlds had been overwhelmed, but sparks of rebellion still smoldered, and the rebel underground on Earth had sent Caine on an undercover mission to the former Earth colony of Plinry, where there was a faint hope that a blackcollar unit still existed. The underground alone knew of a secret that might be humanity's ace in the hole. And if a remnant of blackcollar fighters still existed on Plinry, they were the only hope of playing that ace in a final bid for the freedom of humanity.  Publisher's Note: This book has appeared in parts as The Blackcollar and Blackcollar: The Backlash Mission. This is the first unified appearance of the complete book.",

        "Description": "Often with the very best intentions, Americans expose their children to overwhelming pressures, pressures that can lead to low self-esteem, to teenage pregnancy, and even to teenage suicide. By blurring the boundaries of what is age appropriate, by expecting&#151;or imposing&#151;too much too soon, we force our kids to grow up too fast, to mimic adult sophistication while secretly yearning for innocence.With the first edition of The Hurried Child, David Elkind emerges as the voice of reason, calling our attention to the crippling effects of hurrying. But in the decade since this book first appeared, a new generation of parents has inadvertently stepped up the assault on childhood, misled by the new and comforting rhetoric of childhood \u201dcompetence.\u201dNow Dr. Elkind has thoroughly revised this enormously successful book to debunk the notion of \u201dcompetence\u201d tha thas children racing off to early enrichment programs, burdened by the pressure to \u201dachieve,\u201d and coming home alone to an empty house after school. He sees \u201dsompetence\u201d as a notion meant to rationalize the needs of adults, not to serve the genuine needs of kids, a notion that has fourth graders dieting to fit into designer jeans and children of divorce asked to be the confidants of their troubled parents.In updating this new edition, Dr. Elkind takes a detailed and up-to-the-minute look at the world of today&#39;s kids in terms of education, movies, television, rock & roll, and social trends, to see where the hyrrying occurs and why. And as before, he offers parents and teachers insight, advice, and hope for encouraging healthy development while protecting the joy and feedom of childhood.",

        "Description": "Even in the 24th century, three is definitely a crowd.  Imzadi: to the people of the planet Betazed, including Counselor Deanna Troi of the Starship Enterprise?, it means \"beloved\" and denotes a special closeness that can never be truly broken. Or can it?  In his acclaimed earlier novel, Imzadi, bestselling author Peter David explored the special bond between Deanna Troi and Commander William T. Riker. It revealed new facets of their long and intimate relationship and put that bond to its ultimate test in a powerful and unforgettable story that remains one of the most popular Star Trek\u00ae adventures ever published. Imzadi was a New York Times bestseller in both hardcover and paperback.  Now David examines the heart of Deanna Troi from an altogether different perspective, as he reveals for the first time the full story of Troi's troubled romance with Lieutenant Commander Worf.  At first glance, they cannot be more different. She is an empath, gentle and acutely sensitive to the needs and feelings of others. He is a fierce Klingon warrior, dedicated to a harsh and warlike code of honor. Brought together, however, by a common need to care for Alexander, Worf's troubled, motherless son, they discover hidden reserves of courage and compassion within each other.  Soon mutual respect leads to much stronger emotions as they embark on an unexpected courtship, much to the surprise and discomfort of William Riker.  But does Worf's future truly lie with Deanna...or on a distant outpost called Deep Space 9?? And whom indeed shall Troi ultimately call \"imzadi\"?  Imzadi II is a compelling story, an untold chapter in the history of the Starship Enterprise?.",

You can fill it up with pickles or with popcorn or with glue. An octopus could rest in it, a bird could build a nest in it, a turtle be a guest in it. Or would a horse look best in it? These are samples of the questions and wonderfully silly, laugh-provoking answers in a game played by a little girl and boy dressed up i their parents clothes. On every page of this whimsically playful book, there are enchanting watercolor illustrations by Maurice Sendak. Inspired by the infectiously funny pictures and text, children will soon begin to make rhymes of their own about everyday things. Richly imaginative and wholly in tune with children's high spirits and sense of play, What can you do with a show?, now issued in a new edition with full-color paintings, will be welcomed by young and old. It is a treasure.",

When Jasira's mother finds out what has been going on between her boyfriend and her thirteen-year-old daughter, she has to make a choice -- and chooses to send Jasira off to Houston\u2019 Texas, to live with her father. A remote disciplinarian prone to explosive rages, Jasira's father is unable to show his daughter the love she craves -- and far less able to handle her feelings about her changing body.  Bewildered by extremes of parental scrutiny and neglect, Jasira begins to look elsewhere for affection. Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait, and high school has become a lonely place for a \"towelhead.\" When her father meets, and forbids her to see, her boyfriend, it becomes lonelier still. But there is always Mr. Vuoso -- a neighboring army reservist whose son Jasira babysits. Mr. Vuoso, as Jasira discovers, has an extensive collection of Playboy magazines. And he doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with Jasira's body at all.  Painfully funny, tender, and sexually charged, Towelhead is that rare thing: a gloriously readable novel unafraid to take risks. The story of a girl failed by her parents and by a conflicted America, Towelhead is an ultimately redemptive and moving work that none of us can afford to ignore.",

Since the first edition of this book appeared, professors have praised Weiten's scholarship as exemplary and the accessibility of his prose as unparalleled.  This is the text that redefined the way Introductory Psychology is taught by using integrative themes to develop the connections among different areas of psychological research. And now, with this Fourth Edition, Weiten again raises the bar a notch higher for competitors. Not only has he continued to refine and improve his fine text, but Weiten has developed an exciting multimedia CD-ROM for the course, giving instructors a new, engaging way to teach and students an interactive way to learn. Now, Weiten not only explains the interdependent links between research and applications, but he gives students a fascinating way to explore psychological concepts through experiments and activities included on the \"PsycTrek\" CD-ROM.      Using integrative themes to emphasize connections among different areas of research in psychology, Weiten challenges students to grapple with the big issues and tough questions while mastering the basic concepts of psychology. Throughout the Fourth Edition, Weiten emphasizes the unity in psychology's intellectual heritage (the themes), as well as psychology's immense diversity (the variations). Long after your students have completed their final examinations, they will retain a genuine understanding of the basic ideas about psychology and behavior.",

        "Title": "Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City",
        "Authors": "By Kirtzman, Andrew",
        "Description": "For three surreal weeks in the spring of 2000, Rudy Giuliani held the nation in suspense as he agonized over whether to continue in the race for the U.S. Senate against Hillary Clinton.  He'd been diagnosed with cancer; his marriage was crumbling amid reports of an extramarital affair; his wife tearfully lashed out at him in public.  It was an excruciating private crisis played out before a national audience, and by the time Giuliani finally announced his decision in an extraordinary public performance, the world was again captivated by the drama centering around this unusual man.This is the story of Rudy Giuliani's rise to power, from the moment he and a small squad of ex-prosecutors set out to capture New York City's mayoralty in 1989 to the dramatic turning point in his race against the First Lady of the United States.When Giuliani took over as mayor in 1994, New York was slowly sinking into an abyss of deteriorating living conditions:  It was the crime capital of the country, described by Time magazine as \"The Rotting Apple\"; it was filthy and dangerous, its streets and terminals overtaken by armies of homeless people.  The city was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy again.  Polls showed most New Yorkers wanted out.The public would soon get a taste of Giuliani's style.  Each week brought a new brawl, with the new mayor egging his adversaries on.  He threw Yasir Arafat out of Lincoln Center and sparked an international incident; he tried to evict the Brooklyn Museum after its directors staged an exhibition he deemed sacrilegious; he battled the Mafia, liberals, and leaders of his own party.  The mayor snarled at the very mention of his critics -- and their numbers seemed to grow by the hour.Some viewed him as a savior; others called him a tyrant.  But by the force of his will and little more, this man with no experience in municipal government ended up changing the face of his city.In this riveting portrait of his mayoralty, Andrew Kirtzman tells the story of Giuliani's zealous crusade to clean up, control, and shape New York City.  Based on interviews with more than two hundred of the mayor's closest aides and fiercest adversaries -- and the author's own experience covering him for eight years -- Rudy Giuliani:  Emperor of the City tells the behind-the-scenes story of his reign.Is Rudy Giuliani a hero, a danger, or both?  What's it worth to be led by a strong man?  How much power are we willing to give one person?  Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City offers some answers as it tells the tale of one man's historic rise -- in all its dramatic, outrageous, and ultimately poignant detail.",

While neither attempting to glorify American Jews nor to have them appear smarter than other peoples, Rausch as a Gentile Christian takes a professional historical look at the significant contributions that the Jewish people have made that are integral to everyday life but have largely gone unnoticed in an age when peoplehoods are acknowledged and thanked.In a timely and thorough analysis, Friends, Colleagues, and Neighbors examines the history of famous men and women many Americans may not realize are from Jewish backgrounds. In addition, the book presents American Jews who are making an impact on the nation while remaining virtually unknown to the general public. Covering contributions of national import and civic responsibility, military service and philanthropy, scientific impact and medical breakthroughs, entertainment and commerce, Friends, Colleagues, and Neighbors is full of surprises and interesting details. Provocative and enlightening, the book underscores a diverse and dynamic peoplehood that has enhanced the culture, life, and livelihood of the United States.",

The alternating texts body forth an arresting contrast between the life-styles and social dictions of two American centuries. The contemporary characters include Clayton's wife, Norma, whom he thinks of as the Queen of Disorder, and his mistress, Genevieve Mueller, whom he thinks of as the Perfect Wife, as well as his various colleagues on the faculty of Wayward College in New Hampshire. The characters around Buchanan include his doomed fiancee, Ann Coleman, and such eloquent contemporary politicians as Andrew Jackson, Edwin Stanton, and (in his capacity as American Consul in Liverpool) Nathaniel Hawthorne. All come unsettlingly to life in Clayton's wide-ranging confessions, which bring us down to the year 1991.",

        "Authors": "By Weis, Charlie and Carucci, Vic",
        "Description": "Weis was taught football by some of the best minds in the game: Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick. Parcells would give him a life-defining break in 1990 by hiring him as an assistant on the New York Giants staff. For a Jersey guy who loved sports, this was a dream come true, especially when Weis won his first championship in his debut year in the NFL. He'd always wanted to be a sports announcer\u2014the next Marv Albert\u2014but he'd caught the coaching bug and was now in a position to learn from the best. And he did, following Parcells to the New England Patriots and then to the New York Jets. Under enormous pressure and exacting standards, Weis flourished and later became offensive coordinator.When Parcells stepped down as coach of the Jets, Weis joined his colleague and friend Bill Belichick, who was the newly named Patriots head coach. Together they would thrive, building a storied franchise, a rare modern-day dynasty that won three Super Bowls in four years. Through it all, Weis designed offensive schemes that would befuddle even the best defenses in the NFL, and he coached a number of players to greatness, including Pro Bowlers Ben Coates, Curtis Martin, and, of course, Tom Brady.The chance of a lifetime arrived in December of 2004: Weis was offered the opportunity to lead one of the most prestigious football schools in the country, Notre Dame\u2014home of coaching legends Knute Rockne, Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian, Dan Devine, and Lou Holtz. And so began a new chapter in Weis's career. Weis took over a program in dire need of direction, and now he is in the process of building his own legacy with his unique vision.Off the field, Weis faced his other challenges. Seeking to improve his health and lose weight, he decided to get gastric bypass surgery. What he thought would be a routine procedure turned into a nightmare as he nearly bled to death, lapsed into a coma, and was read the last rites. It was a horrifying experience, yet he battled back in inspiring fashion and still demands nothing less of himself despite the long-lasting aftereffects.He has had his joys, too. Weis considers his wife, Maura, his best friend. They have two beautiful children: Charlie, his \"best buddy,\" and Hannah, who he and his wife consider their \"guiding angel.\" Hannah is developmentally delayed and has been the inspiration leading to the establishment of Hannah and Friends, a nonprofit foundation seeking to improve the quality of life for people with special needs. No Excuses is not only illuminating and insightful, it is an extraordinary look inside one of football's greatest minds who has helped shape today's game.",

But it is easy to miss the subtle signs of aggression in girls--the dirty looks, the taunting notes, or the exclusion from the group-that send girls home crying. In Odd Girl Out, Rachel Simmons focuses on these interactions and provides language for the indirect aggression that runs through the lives and friendships of girls. These exchanges take place within intimate circles--the importance of friends and the fear of losing them is key. Without the cultural consent to express their anger or to resolve their conflicts, girls express their aggression in covert but damaging ways. Every generation of women can tell stories of being bullied, but Odd Girl Out explores and explains these experiences for the first time.Journalist Rachel Simmons sheds light on destructive patterns that need our attention. With advice for girls, parents, teachers, and even school administrators, Odd Girl Out is a groundbreaking work that every woman will agree is long overdue.",

        "Description": "Who are the all-time greatest and why? This groundbreaking new method for ranking players and teams rewrites the record books and sets forth bold new answers to the age-old debates of baseball.  It is nothing less than a revolution in baseball statistics. G. Scott Thomas has developed a series of mathematically precise, computer-generated formulas that adjust the statistics of every team. The results \"level the field,\" creating a fair basis of comparison among generations of players-and the new picture that emerges is staggering. Here are just a few of the book's conclusions:  - Babe Ruth hit ninety-four home runs in a single season, shattering Bonds' record (Maris, McGwire, and Bonds don't even make the list).  - Pete Rose has still played more games than anyone in baseball history.  - Ricky Henderson never really broke Ty Cobb's record of runs scored.  - Cy Young holds the record for most wins (and most losses) of any pitcher.  - Lou Gehrig made the equivalent of $48,300,000 in 1931.Leveling the Field adjusts the statistics in all the major categories in which fans make comparisons, including the best performances, the best players, the best teams and adjusted career stats for 254 hitters and 177 pitchers. Thomas even assembles his twenty-six-man \"dream team\" of the sport's greatest players since 1901, and takes them through a simulated 162-game season.  Easy to follow and use, this book is sure to become a must-have for every die-hard baseball fan, and will undoubtedly change the nature of baseball debate forever.",

Durand, Fitz Hugh Lane, William Sidney Mount, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, and Albert Pinkham Ryder. Examining each artist in an individual essay, Barbara Novak presents key ideas on the nature of American art of the nineteenth century, framing these ideas with reference to the eighteenth and twentieth centuries and relating American art to American and European traditions. She draws provocative and original conclusions about the roles in American art of spiritualism and mathematics, analyzes not only the painting but nineteenth-century aesthetic theory as well, achieving a unique synthesis of art and literature. Brief biographies of forty-eight artists mentioned in the text are appended and furnish a valuable reference source.",

Rarely seen areas of the complex, such as the Pope\u2019s personal quarters and the world-renowned libraries, and up-close views of the stunning and priceless art and architecture provide an unrivaled insider\u2019s look into this amazing nation.In this revised trade paperback edition, Washington Post writer Howard Schneider brings the story of the Vatican up-to-date, including the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II and the selection and ordination of Pope Benedict XVI. Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s recent trip to the United States is also documented in poignant words and images.",

Two young women besieged by  the demands of mothers, lovers, and careers\u2014not to mention a highly persistent telephone  answering machine\u2014as they struggle to have it all. A brilliant feminist art historian  trying to keep her bearings and her sense of humor on the elevator ride from the  radical sixties to the heartless eighties.Wendy Wasserstein's characters are so  funny, so many-sided, and so real that we seem to know them from their Scene One  entrances, though the places they go are invariably surprising. And these three plays\u2014Uncommon  Women and Others, Isn't It Romantic, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Heidi Chronicles\u2014manage  to engage us heart, mind, and soul on such a deep and lasting level that they are  already recognized as classics of the modern theater.",

It has been used to redesign IKEA\u2019s product pipeline in Sweden, develop an integrated economic development plan in Northern Ireland, and demobilize child soldiers in Southern Sudan. Written by the originators, this book is the most up-to-date account of this powerful change method. This third edition is completely revised, reorganized, and updated with nine new chapters. It contains new cases and examples, advice on combining Future Search with other methods, and a summary of formal research studies. The chapters on facilitating diversity provide a theory, philosophy, and method for working with any task group. Marvin Weisbord and Sandra Janoff offer specific guidance for Future Search sponsors, steering committees, participants, and facilitators and new ideas for sustaining action after the Future Search ends. They\u2019ve added striking evidence of Future Search\u2019s efficacy over time, examples of its economic benefits, guidelines for making Future Searches green, and much more. They include a wealth of resources\u2014handouts, sample client workbooks, follow-up methods, and other practical tools. If you want to do strategic planning, product innovation, quality improvement, organizational restructuring, mergers, or any other major change requiring stakeholder engagement, this book is your guide.",
