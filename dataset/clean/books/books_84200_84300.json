The handy reference section lists all restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, and\u00a0special features and offers a specific guide for vegetarians. More than just\u00a0entertaining reads, these\u00a0are\u00a0essential references for anyone who eats out. Acclaimed critic Robin Goldstein and his team of local undercover chefs have created a blockbuster of a book, covering every corner of the District's eclectic dining scene, from the power steakhouses to the casual bistros, including DC area suburbs from Alexandria to Silver Spring.",

        "Description": "\u201cHistory must be made to march in the direction of genuine human progress; world affairs have no intrinsic momentum that necessarily results in the victory of decency. Maintaining the morale necessary to achieving progress in history requires us to live our lives, today, against a moral horizon of responsibility that is wider and deeper than the quest for personal satisfactions. The future of our civilization does not rest merely on the advance of material wealth and technological prowess; the future of the West turns on the question of whether our spiritual aspirations are noble or base.\u201d\u2014from Faith, Reason, and the War Against JihadismMore than half a decade after 9/11, safe passage through a moment of history fraught with both peril and possibility requires Americans across the political spectrum to see things as they are.In this incisive, engaging study of the present danger and what we must do to prevail against it, George Weigel, one of America\u2019s foremost public intellectuals, does precisely that: he sees, and describes, things as they are\u2014and as they might be. Drawing on a quarter century of experience at the intersection of moral argument and public policy, he describes rigorously and clearly the threat posed by global jihadism: the religiously inspired ideology which teaches that it is the moral obligation of all Muslims to employ whatever means are necessary to compel the world\u2019s submission to Islam. Exploring that ideology\u2019s theological, social, cultural, and political roots, Weigel points a new direction for both public policy and interreligious dialogue, one that meets the challenge of jihadism forthrightly while creating the conditions for a less threatening, more mutually enriching encounter between Islam and the West.Essential reading in a time of momentous political decisions, Faith, Reason, and the War Against Jihadism is a clarion call for a new seriousness of debate and a new clarity of purpose in American public life.",

        "Description": "It\u2019s hard to decide which is more frightening--the \u201cfood\u201d teenagers enjoy, or the things they say about their bodies. Whether it\u2019s your son\u2019s passion for chips and soda or your daughter\u2019s announcement that she \u201cfeels fat,\u201d kids\u2019 attitude about how they look and what they should eat often seem devoid of common sense. In a world where television and school cafeterias push super-sized sandwiches while magazines feature pencil-thin models, many teens feel pressured to starve themselves and others eat way too much. Blending her experience as the mother of four with results from a survey of nearly 5,000 teens, Dr. Diane Neumark-Sztainer shows you how to respond constructively to \u201cfat talk,\u201d counteract negative media messages, and give your kids the straight story about nutrition and calories, the dangers of dieting, and eating right when they\u2019re away from home. Full of examples illustrating the challenges teens face today, this upbeat and insightful book is packed with great ideas that will help kids everywhere feel better about their looks and make healthier choices about eating and exercise.",

        "Description": "\"Sometimes sports mirrors society, sometimes it allows us to understand the larger society a little better. But mostly, it is a world of entertainment of talented and driven young men and women who do certain things with both skill and passion.\"--David HalberstamDavid Halberstam was a distinguished journalist and historian of American politics. He was also a sports writer.Everything They Had brings together for the first time his articles from newspapers and magazines, a wide-ranging collection edited by Glenn Stout, selected over the full scope of Halberstam's five decades as one of America's most honored journalists. These are dazzling portraits of some of the most compelling sports figures of our era, the superstars of popular sports like basketball, football, and baseball, but also fishing, soccer, and rowing, and the amateur athletes who play for the love of the game.In \"My Dinner with Theodore,\" Halberstam recounts his long anticipated--and unforgettable--meeting with Red Sox legend Ted Williams. Against the backdrop of 1960s Nashville, he beautifully recounts a lifelong love of football in \"How I Fell in Love with the NFL.\" And \"Men Without Women,\" set on a fishing expedition in Patagonia, is more than a hunt for giant brown trout--it is a story of fishing, friendship, and fellowship. These and many more stories exemplify the breadth and depth of David Halberstam's devotion to diverse sports and his respect and fascination for the men and women who play them so well.The result is an intimate and personal collection that reveals the issues and the ideals David Halberstam cared about--racial equality, friendship, loyalty, and character--and creates a vivid and unforgettable portrait of the author himself. Everything They Had takes its rightful place alongside Halberstam's bestselling sports titles, which includeThe Breaks of the Game, The Amateurs, Summer of '49, and The Education of a Coach.",

        "Description": "In April 1975, as Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese Army, John Bissell, a former Marine officer living in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, was glued to his television. Struggling to save his marriage, raise his sons, and live with his memories of the war in Vietnam, Bissell found himself racked with anguish and horror as his country abandoned a cause for which so many of his friends had died.Opening with a gripping account of the chaotic and brutal last month of the war, The Father of All Things is Tom Bissell\u2019s powerful reckoning with the Vietnam War and its impact on his father, his country, and Vietnam itself. Through him we learn what it was like to grow up with a gruff but oddly tender veteran father who would wake his children in the middle of the night when the memories got too painful. Bissell also explores the many debates about the war, from whether it was winnable to Ho Chi Minh\u2019s motivations to why America\u2019s leaders lied so often. Above all, he shows how the war has continued to influence American views on foreign policy more than thirty years later.At the heart of this book is John and Tom Bissell\u2019s unforgettable journey back to Vietnam. As they travel the country and talk to Vietnamese veterans, we relive the war as John Bissell experienced it, visit the site of his near-fatal wounding, and hear him explain how Vietnam shaped him and so many of his generation.This is the first major book about the war by an author who grew up after the fall of Saigon. It is a fascinating, all-too-relevant work about the American character\u2013and about war itself. It is also a wise and moving book about fathers, sons, and the universal desire to understand who our parents were before they became our parents.",

Her work has the kind of singularity and sustained integrity that are very, very rare. It's always a dicey business predicting the literary future[but] for this reader, these poems feel as if there were built to last, andthey have the passion, precision and sheer weirdness to do so.\"Salon compared the poems in Ryan's last collection to \"Faberg\u00e9 eggs, tiny, ingenious devices that inevitably conceal some hidden wonder.\" The exquisite poems in The Niagara River provide similarly hidden gems. Bafflingly effective, they seem too brief and blithe to pack so much wallop. Intense and relaxed at once, both buoyant and rueful, their singular music appeals to many people. Her poems, products of an immaculately off-kilter mind, have been featured everywhere from the Sunday funnies to New York subways to plaques at the zoo to the pages of The New Yorker.",

        "Description": "Women and men are different. Unfortunately, doctors, medical researchers, and health care providers have not always recognized how these differences can affect health. The result has been that women sometimes receive inappropriate medical care. The Savvy Woman Patient delves into the many sex differences in health and a wide range of diseases--as well as prevention strategies, diagnosis, and treatments for those diseases. Researched and written by the respected Society for Women's Health Research and based on its almost 15 years as a research advocacy organization, this comprehensive guide provides real answers to vital questions that affect a woman's health from young adulthood to menopause and beyond. The Savvy Woman Patient covers sex-based biology; family histories; women\u2019s special nutrition, exercise, preventive measures, and aging process; and diseases and conditions that affect women differently than men. Contents include addiction; asthma and other lung problems; auto-immune diseases; bone health; brain and degenerative diseases; cancer; cardiovascular disease; diabetes; digestive disorders; eating disorders; eye health; kidney, bladder, and urinary tract health; menopause; mental health; oral health; pain; pharmaceuticals; sleep; and STDs and HIV/AIDS.

And after you read Why Do Dogs Drink out of the Toilet?, it will make perfect sense to you, too. Award-winning pet experts Dr. Marty Becker and Gina Spadafori take you on a trip into the canine mind. And it's not at all a scary place. . . .Dogs live to smell, to feel good, to clarify their relationship with other dogs (and with us), to love, to laugh. When you start looking at the world their way, everything falls into place. Of course they drink out of the toilet\u2014the water is fresher. Sniffing another dog's behind is just like reading their resume, except you know nothing is made up. Barking at the letter carrier makes him go away\u2014every single time! And rolling in stinky stuff just smells like heaven. (Because what smells heavenly is, after all, a matter of taste.)The better you understand dogs, the easier it is to love the pooch on your couch. Find out why hunting dogs don't mind suppressing their basic instinct, how assistance dogs for the blind get their job done, why little dogs like to mix it up with big dogs, and everything you always wanted to know about canine sex but were afraid to ask.You'll also find the answers to questions that tend to tickle your curiosity: How do dogs get into dog shows? Which breeds are made in America? Do some dogs really have dreadlocks? Do all dogs need a backyard? How did Lassie always find her way home?You've got questions? This book's got answers.",

The decisions we make now and the actions we take will determine the future of America and the American dream. Concerned citizens understand this but they have lost trust and confidence in their leaders, institutions, and the governing elite. They are searching for a resource to help them think about and respond to this situation. Renewing the American Dream is that resource. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the American condition using a unique three-part Renewal Framework, created by the authors. It frames the dimensions of America's current situation in holistic terms and brings the citizen's voice and the businessperson's perspective to the forefront in a national dialogue, which to this point has been dominated by elected officials, lobbyists, talk show hosts, academics, economists, and journalists. It can be seen as a twenty-first-century equivalent of Thomas Paine's Common Sense.",

        "Description": "From Lisa Tucker, the critically acclaimed author of The Song Reader, comes a wise, humorous, and deeply compassionate novel about the risks and rewards of loving when a single day can change our lives.Nineteen years ago, a famous man disappeared from Los Angeles, taking his two children, Dorothea and Jimmy, to a rocky, desolate corner of New Mexico where he raised them in complete isolation in a utopian \"Sanctuary.\" The children grew up with books and encyclopedias, records and a grand piano, but no television, computer, radio, or even a newspaper. Now Dorothea, at twenty-three, is leaving this place in search of her missing brother -- and venturing into the wide world for the first time.Dorothea's search will turn into an odyssey of discovery, leading to the truth of her family's past and the terrifying day that changed her father forever. But Dorothea's journey will also introduce her to an unusual cast of characters, including a homeless girl from Missouri who becomes a jazz singer and a social worker whose mistake in judgment changes her best friend's life. And she will meet Stephen, a doctor turned cabdriver who, after suffering his own losses, has lost his ability to believe in a meaningful world. Together, they have a chance to make a discovery of a different kind: that though a heart can be broken by the tragic events of a day, a day can also bring a new chance at love and a deeper understanding of life's infinite possibilities.Beautifully written, with a spellbinding story, Once Upon a Day is \"a lyrically poignant reminder of the necessity of hope\" (Publishers Weekly, starred review).",
