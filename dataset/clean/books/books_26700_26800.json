When it stings him between the eyes, he is overwhelmed by a tidal wave of memories crashing through his mind in a flood of simultaneous sensations and emotions. As he collapses, he manages to catch and hold onto the bug.At the hospital, medical technologist Pilar Ramirez watches as the creature is pried from Lester Ordway's hand. It releases a swarm of even smaller insects that sting her and several other people in the emergency room causing similar, if milder, cognitive effects. Frightened but fascinated, and frustrated by the hospital's attempt to dismiss what happened after the bugs disappear, Pilar befriends Lester and joins his quest for an explanation. Pilar and Lester enlist the help of entomologist Maybelle Terwilliger, and the three soon begin to suspect that they have discovered a secret alien invasion of Earth. An incursion on a tiny scale but of global scope, it is pervasive reconnaissance that puts the legendary hundred eyes of Argus to shame. Somebody is literally bugging the planet. Can Pilar and her friends convince the government before it's too late?",

Firefly Animal Rescue is a new series of books about endangered and threatened species and what is being done to protect them. It is aimed at readers aged 10 and up with accessible text and color photographs.     Each book introduces readers to a featured animal, explains the threats it is facing, and explores efforts to protect it. Young readers will be inspired by the leading scientists and conservationists who work in the field, in labs and on the public stage. The books conclude with additional resources for those who want to help.    Panda Rescue takes readers into the remote bamboo forests of China, where scientists can spend years without ever seeing the elusive animal. It looks inside one of the largest breeding centres in China and reveals some controversial            attempts to save the species. And it explains how our fascination with captive pandas has become a threat of its own.    Tracing the colorful history of the black-and-white bear, Panda Rescue shows why many conservationists remain hopeful about the animal's future.    About the Firefly Animal Rescue series:    The Firefly Animal Rescue identifies endangered and threatened species and what is being done to protect them. Combining lively, accessible text and stunning color photographs, each book provides a detailed overview of the species, describing its characteristics, behavior, habits, physiology and more.    \"These attractive books are a call to action... fascinating readable accounts.\"  - School Library Journal    \"Succinct introductions to             the science and practice of wildlife conservation... written in accessible, lively language.\"  - Booklist",

When more victims are discovered, Chase realizes that while the killer resembles a white shark, it is far more dangerous and malevolent than any shark he has encountered before.",

A forensic psychiatrist of great talent, she is also blind and paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair on a remote island in Lake Michigan.In this, their first case, a tragedy from the past has outsmarted the law, leaving Maddy and Alex on their own to find a vicious killer.When Alex arrives at his sister's isolated home in desperation, grieving over the murder of his lover, Toni, Maddy vows to help him where the police have given up. As it happens, she possesses the only means of detection that can solve the case: the power to re-create the past through forensic hypnosis.Channeling her investigative prowess into the depths of the mind, Maddy takes Alex back to the events leading up to Toni's death. Once there, Alex is actually able to relive the horrible events as they search for the murderer. Meanwhile, Maddy uses the vantage point of the present to piece together the shocking clues as they come together to create a montage of the killer's persona. But as she approaches the horrible truth behind the murders, the events of the past catch up with Maddy herself, bringing her into very real and present danger.A stunning debut of a unique detective team, Death Trance interlocks a fascinating chain between the past and the present, and the power each holds to reveal - or repress - the reality of the other.",

Almost.A man called Jack Giffey is planning to break into the Omphalos, the most secure building in all of separatist Green Idaho. Rumor says that the Omphalos houses the not-quite-dead - the very wealthy deceased who are still alive, their brains connected directly into Thinkers. Data is the great treasure of the new millennium, and Giffey plans to tap into the Omphalos dataflow, to steal the knowledge gathered by the inhabitants of the Omphalos.Public Defender Mary Choy, now living in Seattle, has been called in on the bizarre suicide (or murder) of a very wealthy, secretive man. His last recordings hint at some terrible guilty secret. Choy would very much like to know what such a man - rich and politically powerful - might have done that he could no longer live with.And in the offices of Mind Design, Inc., Jill, the most advanced artificial intelligence in the world, has had a unique experience. She has received a request for contact from a new AI, one she does not know and did not help to design. Jill has never met a stranger of her own kind before; is it an alien Thinker or the offspring of some vast conspiracy?",

        "Description": "In 1862 military necessity enabled Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to pry from a hesitant President Lincoln the authority to enlist black troops in the Union army. The pioneer regiment of ex-slaves was to secure the beachhead tenously held at Beaufort, off the South Carolina coast. Within a year, Lincoln was to hail the enlistment of black soldiers, which he had earlier resisted as \"revolutionary,\" as the \"heaviest blow yet dealt the rebellion.\" The abolition of slavery, unthinkable in 1861, was to be inevitable by 1863.The commanding officer chosen for the First South Carolina Volunteers was Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a militant human rights activist, writer and lecturer, and former Unitarian minister. \"In all the land,\" writes the historian Ray Allen Billington, they \"could have found no one better for this assignment.\" Higginson was an excellent strategist and administrator who combined firmness with warmth and charm. Closely watched in the nation's press by both friends and foes of the undertaking, he soon shaped a first-class regiment.Army Life in a Black Regiment is Colonel Higginson's stirring account of his two years at Camp Saxton, recording the immediate effect of a decision that proved crucial to our survival as a nation and that ultimately shaped constitutional history. It is both a literary masterpiece and a unique historical document.",

        "Description": "Contemporary women face numerous challenging and often painful issues, including infertility, caring for aging parents, singleness, the generation gap, the role of women in marriage and ministry, materialism, and difficult marriages. We're not alone. All of these issues were faced by women in the Bible, and it's God's desire that we learn from, and find encouragement in, their stories. Learn how you can make a difference in your family, your church, and your community by studying the examples of scriptural women who in so many ways were just like us.",

        "Description": "Senator James Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party on May 24, 2001, when he could no longer reconcile his beliefs with the policies of the party he had supported his whole adult life. \"Looking ahead,\" Jeffords said, \"I can see more and more instances where I will disagree with the President on very fundamental issues.\"  In My Declaration of Independence, Jeffords explains the issues that led to this dramatic break. Foremost among them was the Bush Administration's and the Republican leadership's failure to recognize the need to invest in education, now and in the future.  Tracing the genesis of his decision, Jeffords describes his attempts to effect change within his party, and the pain of hurting Republican colleagues and friends. His decision came just at the moment when his defection would deprive them of the Washington trifecta they had recently achieved -- Republican control of the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. It was also going to cost many of his friends committee chairmanships they had acquired only a few months before. \"But in the end,\" he writes, \"I had to be true to what I thought was right, and leave the consequences to sort themselves out in the days ahead.\"  In a contemporary Profiles in Courage, Senator Jeffords provides a moving, witty, and instructive example of what can happen in public life. Whether you agree with his views or not, his account of his tough decisions, and of his anguish at rejecting the last-minute appeals of the leadership of his party, the President, and his wife, is a riveting story that has wide implications for the whole country.",

They meet each day in the law library, their turf at Trumble, where they write briefs, handle cases for other inmates, practice law without a license, and sometimes dispense jailhouse justice. And they spend hours writing letters. They are fine-tuning a mail scam, and it's starting to really work. The money is pouring in.Then their little scam goes awry. It ensnares the wrong victim, a powerful man on the outside, a man with dangerous friends, and the Brethren's days of quietly marking time are over.",

A floating slab of solid ice the size of France, more than 3,000 feet thick.  THE EVENT On Thanksgiving weekend, six precisely placed nuclear warheads buried 2,000 feet beneath the ice detonate in sequence, shearing the Ross Shelf from the underwater rises that anchor it.  In just three hours, huge fractures rip through the Shelf, freeing the ice from the grip of the land more than a half mile beneath it. Then a seventh warhead explodes eighteen miles above the Shelf's center, generating an electromagnetic pulse that blinds every spy and weather satellite over the southern hemisphere. Now there can be no warning for what happens next.  The nuclear shock wave drives the Shelf into the Pacific of 500 miles per hour, creating an initial wall of water 1,400 feel high. Unseen, unsuspected, unstoppable, the displacement wave formed by the wall's collapse radiates northward. In thirty-five hours, it will lay waste to Hawaii. In thirty-eight hours, the southeastern regions of Japan will become little more than swampland. And in forty hours, the entire Los Angeles Basin will be flooded to a depth of twenty feet. By then, the death toll will be measured in the millions, and it will take more than fifty years for the Pacific Rim nations to recover from the economic devastation.  At least, that's the plan.  But what those responsible for this outrageous act of global destruction did not anticipate was one man and one woman, thrown together in the most remote continent on Earth, who become the only survivors who can outrace the wave of destruction, expose the terrorists who set it in motion, and uncover the staggering secret that can stop it.  Set against a split-second race to prevent global devastation, and based on the astounding cutting-edge technologies that will take the U.S. military into the next century, Icefire is the story of Navy SEAL Captain Mitch Webber and oceanographer Cory Rey. Once lovers, now enemies, they're plunged into a maelstrom of international intrigue and betrayal reaching from Beijing to the highest levels of the Pentagon.  Critically acclaimed for their earlier works of speculative fiction and suspense, with Icefire Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens have become an exciting new voice in contemporary thrillers.",

White, Roald Dahl, or E. Nesbit. Now the editors of the Adrenaline series have moved into a new genre with the same attention to great stories, great characters, and great writing that has made Adrenaline the most successful series of its kind. In addition to the above writers, Wizards draws upon a rich load of forgotten classics (without which there would be no Harry Potter) by such authors as Jane Yolen, George MacDonald, Frances Hodgson Burnett, A.

Penny's husband, John, is in prison for an accidental murder that happened because he was trying to be too careful. And in prison he will, almost accidentally, become a hero, which makes him prey to what he fears most--hope.  An eerie succession of events will take these people into the bull's-eye of risk that everyday life presents. While the Gypsy Man may be just one of Crawford's myths, John and Penny Bone are as real as the rising sun, and their strength, separately and together, reminds us why life is worth living. The Gypsy Man, and its durable and enduring characters, illuminates how an elusive truth lives behind every legend.",

        "Description": "\"From some of the most horrendous chapters in human history,\" writes Scott A. Hunt, \"these great leaders have emerged to show us a different path, proving not only that the cessation of war is possible, but that the removal of hatred and violence from our hearts is possible as well . . . they show us that the promise of peace remains intact. It is to these people that we can turn in order to replenish our encouragement, hope, and inspiration.\"What does it mean to fight for peace today? We all want lasting peace. But is it really possible, and how do we achieve it? Defying military intelligence officers in Burma, secret police in Vietnam, and combatants in the Occupied Territories of Palestine, Scott Hunt spent three years traveling across the globe -- often under arduous conditions -- to seek out the wisdom of the world's leading peacemakers.In intimate conversations with these remarkable leaders, recounting histories that are not taught in school and uncovering important lessons that are often brushed aside, Hunt skillfully coaxes out staggering stories, including those of Burma's legendary pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Tibet's moral authority the Dalai Lama, Vietnam's leading dissident Thich Quang Do, famed primate specialist and humanitarian Dr. Jane Goodall, Cambodia's Supreme Patriarch Maha Ghosananda, Costa Rica's Nobel Peace Laureate Oscar Arias, and other great leaders who have battled to end the brutality against the people and causes they cherish. This extraordinary investigation offers far-ranging insights and invaluable lessons, changing the way we think about the world and our responsibility toward one another.These heroic figures are unwilling to accept that our lives must consist of the tragedy of unremitting conflict and warfare. They explain not only the basis of the conflicts they are working to resolve, but what inspires them to stay resolute in their commitment to peace. Engaging, uplifting, and at times unexpectedly humorous, The Future of Peace conveys both a message of hope and a call to action, revealing what it means to hold an unwavering vision of compassion, to be a leader, and to preserve peace in our own day-to-day lives.",
