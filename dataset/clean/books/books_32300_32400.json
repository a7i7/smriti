Flush from their narrow victory over the horrific Vlagh, Longbow and his companions are drawn to this pastoral territory in south Dhrall, confident that they will thwart the next assault by their inhuman foe. But on the border of the desolate Wasteland, the Vlagh is breeding a monstrous new army of venomous bat-bugs and armored spiders.

Conspiring to plunder this unspoiled land, Jalkan raises a force of armed acolytes and declares a global holy war. Caught up in the clash of these vast powers, neither Longbow and his allies nor Jalkan and his troops grasp the new danger among them. A mysterious entity - neither god nor mortal - has begun to meddle with the minds of both the locals and the invaders, spinning a web of intrigue that entraps all in its path.Farmers and hunters, soldiers and madmen, mortals and gods - all charge to a battle that will decide the fate of the world.",

Here, a leading American anthropologist has analyzed the many qays in which people \"talk\" to one another without the use of words.\u00a0The pecking order in a chicken yard, the fierce competition in a school playground, every unwitting gesture and action\u2014this is the vocabulary of the \"silent language.\" According to Dr. Hall, the concepts of space\u00a0and time\u00a0are tools with which all human beings may transmit messages. Space, for example, is the outgrowth of an animal's instinctive defense of his lair and is reflected in human society by the office worker's jealous defense of his desk, or the guarded, walled patio of a Latin-American home. Similarly, the concept of time, varying from Western precision to Easter vagueness, is revealed by the businessman who pointedly keeps a client waiting, or the South Pacific islander who murders his neighbor for an injustice suffered twenty years ago.\"THE SILENT LANGUAGE shows how cultural factors influence the individual behind his back, wihtout his knowledge.\"\u00a0\u2014Erich Fromm",

And is either as free as a man? Ultimately, Mary remains true only to the three rules she learned on the streets: Never give up your liberty. Clothes make the woman. Clothes are the greatest lie ever told.",

A student of Darwinian biology, he formed his romantic conceptions of the scientific world at an early age.This novel, one of his first forays into the science fiction genre, concerns a mad surgeon-turned-vivisectionist who, in his laboratory on a remote island, performs ghoulish experiments in an attempt to transform animals into men, with monstrous results. It is one of Wells' earliest and most sinister personifications of the scientific quest to control and manipulate the natural world, and, ultimately, human nature itself.First published in 1896, The Island of Dr. Moreau has intrigued and horrified readers for generations. It will gain legions of new fans in this inexpensive Dover edition.",

One of these employees, former Consular Operations agent Hal Ambler, is one of the few who is so dangerous that he is in complete isolation from other patients, kept heavily medicated and closely watched. But there's one critical difference between Ambler and the other patients in the facility: Ambler isn't crazy.With the help of a sympathetic nurse, Ambler manages to first clear his mind of the drug-induced haze and then executes a daring escape. On the loose and barely one step ahead of the retrieval teams sent after him, he is out to discover who had him stashed in the psychiatric hospital and why. But the world he returns to isn't the one he so clearly remembers - friends and longtime associates don't recognize him, and there are no official records of any person named Hal Ambler. With no resources and his unknown enemies closing in on him, Ambler has to uncover the truth of who he was and figure out what it is about him - remember what he knows - that makes him such a danger that someone is willing to risk everything to see him dead.",

On stage, a good vaudeville routine could last years as it was performed on tour across the country. On radio, a year's vaudeville material might be fodder for one week's broadcast. Bob Hope used new material not only for his weekly radio series, but also for the several live charity appearances he made each week.Organized by the stages of his life, accompanied by black-and-white photographs, this book gives readers a chance to enjoy the very best of Hope's jokes, from his early years in vaudeville, his top-rated radio show in the '30s and '40s, his legendary television appearances, and much more.",

        "Description": "G\u00fcnter Grass has been wrestling with Germany's past for decades now, but no book since The Tin Drum has generated as much excitement as this engrossing account of the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff. A German cruise ship turned refugee carrier, it was attacked by a Soviet submarine in January 1945. Some 9,000 people went down in the Baltic Sea, making it the deadliest maritime disaster of all time. Born to an unwed mother on a lifeboat the night of the attack, Paul Pokriefke is a middle-aged journalist trying to piece together the tragic events. While his mother sees her whole existence in terms of that calamitous moment, Paul wishes their life could have been less touched by the past. For his teenage son, who dabbles in the dark, far-right corners of the Internet, the Gustloff embodies the denial of Germany's wartime suffering. \"Scuttling backward to move forward,\" Crabwalk is at once a captivating tale of a tragedy at sea and a fearless examination of the ways different generations of Germans now view their past.Winner of the Nobel Prize",
