        "Title": "The Kiss",
        "Authors": "By Steel, Danielle",
        "Description": "In her 53rd bestselling novel, Danielle Steel explores how a single shattering moment  can change lives forever. The Kiss is at once a moving testament to the fragility  of life and a breathtaking story about the power of love to heal, to free, to transform,  and to make broken spirits whole.  On a warm June evening, a red double-decker bus,  full of passengers, speeds down a London street. A few blocks away, a man and a woman  climb into a limousine, reveling in a magical evening of dancing and champagne.   As their driver pulls into an intersection, the couple shares their first, searching  kiss. For a moment, etched in time, all stands still \u2014 until, in a flash of metal  and glass, their limousine is struck at full speed, crushed under the bus\u2019s tremendous  weight. And a long journey begins \u2014 toward healing, toward hope, toward dreams of  an infinite future....  Isabelle Forrester is the wife of a prominent Parisian banker  who has long since shut her out of his heart. For lonely years, Isabelle has lived  a life of isolation, pouring her passions into caring for her desperately ill son,  Teddy, and into making their Paris home as happy as possible for her teenage daughter,  Sophie.   Isabelle allows herself one secret pleasure: a long-distance friendship  by telephone with an American man, a Washington power broker who travels in the highest  circles of politics and who, like Isabelle, is trapped in an empty marriage.   To  Bill Robinson, Isabelle is a godsend, a woman of extraordinary beauty and intellectual  curiosity \u2014 a kindred spirit who touches him across the miles with her warmth and  gentle empathy. Their relationship is a gift, a lifeline that sustains them both  through the heartache of marriages they cannot leave and will not betray.   Agreeing  to meet for a few precious, innocent days in London, Isabelle and Bill find their  friendship changing. Then, amid the sudden crash of steel against steel, they are  thrust onto a new path, a path fraught with pain but also with possibility.  Now,  inside the cool, sterile wards of a London hospital, Isabelle and Bill cling to life,  their bodies shattered almost beyond repair. In the days and weeks that follow, they  slowly, painfully traverse a road to recovery littered with challenges of the body,  spirit, and heart.   Together, they must find the strength not only to embrace life  again but to face what they have left behind. For Isabelle, a loveless marriage turns  into a brutal power struggle. For Bill, a time of healing exposes wounds that cut  deeper than steel and realities that will test him to his core. For both, a tangle  of changing relationships and the tragedy of another loss conspire to separate them  once again. And this time they could lose each other forever.   In a novel that is  as compelling as it is compassionate, Danielle Steel weaves a story of courage in  the face of unimaginable loss. With the grace of a master storyteller, she explores  the strength it takes to conquer our greatest fears, showing us how the toughest  choices can yield the most unexpected rewards ... and how the longest, most winding  journeys can begin with a single kiss.",

Author George Lakoff has become a key advisor to the Democratic party, helping them develop their message and frame the political debate.In this book Lakoff explains how conservatives think, and how to counter their arguments. He outlines in detail the traditional American values that progressives hold, but are often unable to articulate. Lakoff also breaks down the ways in which conservatives have framed the issues, and provides examples of how progressives can reframe the debate.Lakoff's years of research and work with environmental and political leaders have been distilled into this essential guide, which shows progressives how to think in terms of values instead of programs, and why people vote their values and identities, often against their best interests.Don't Think of An Elephant! is the antidote to the last forty years of conservative strategizing and the right wing's stranglehold on political dialogue in the United States.Read it, take action\u2014and help take America back.",

But in the seventeenth century they were revolutionary, heretical, even dangerous to the men who formed them. Culture, religion, and science had intertwined over the centuries to create a world view based on a stationary earth. Indeed, if the earth moved, would not birds be blown off the trees and would not an object thrown straight up come down far away?Then came the Renaissance and with it Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Huygens, and Newton: giants who courageously remade the world into an earth which actually moves 100,000 feet a second while revolving 1,000 miles an hour around an object 93,000,000 miles away. And yet birds perch unruffled and an apple will fall straight down.All of this we think we know. But how well do we know it? In the twenty-five years since its first publication, The Birth of a New Physics has become a classic in the history of science. Here expanded by more than one-third and fully updated, it not only offers us the best account of the greatest scientific revolution but also tells us how we can know we live in a dynamic universe.",

        "Description": "A magnificent storyteller with vast imaginative range, Anita Diamant gave voice to the silent women of the Old Testament in The Red Tent. Now, in her third novel, she brings to vivid life an early New England world that history has forgotten.Set on Cape Ann in the early 1800s, The Last Days of Dogtown is peopled by widows, orphans, spinsters, scoundrels, whores, free Africans, and \"witches.\" Nearly a decade ago, Diamant found an account of an abandoned rural backwater near the Massachusetts coastline at the turn of the nineteenth century. That pamphlet inspired a stunning novel about a small group of eccentrics and misfits, struggling in a harsh, isolated landscape only fifty miles north of Boston, yet a world away.Among the inhabitants of Dogtown are Black Ruth, an African woman who dresses as a man and works as a stone mason; Mrs. Stanley, an imperious madam whose grandson, Sammy, comes of age in her rural brothel; Oliver Younger, who survives a miserable childhood at the hands of a very strange aunt; and Cornelius Finson, a freed slave whose race denies him everything. At the center of it all is Judy Rhines, a fiercely independent soul, deeply lonely, who nonetheless builds a life for herself and inspires those around her to become more generous and tolerant themselves.This is a story of hardship and resilience -- and an extraordinary re-creation of an untold chapter of early American life. With a keen ear for language and profound compassion for her characters, Diamant has written her most moving and powerful novel.",

        "Authors": "By GILES, FRANK",
        "Description": "Napoleon Bonaparte never set foot on English soil, although he was held aboard a warship off the coast of Devon after his surrender to the Royal Navy in 1815. Nor did he ever admit to being a prisoner. With its focus on the last six years of Napoleon\u2019s life?from his arrival at Devon, where he became the object of massive English public interest, through his exile on St. Helena, where he died in 1821?this close study of Napoleon in captivity attempts to reconstruct an authentic portrait of the fallen emperor by examining contemporary documents and public records of opinion. As this judicious volume by journalist and historian Frank Giles shows, Napoleon worked hard at St. Helena to obfuscate the history of his tyranny in France with a legend that would elevate him as the architect of a federation of free European peoples?had it not been for the fears of reactionary monarchs and the envy of England. Many English citizens, most of them discontent Whigs, stood among Napoleon\u2019s collaborators in this legend, just as many of them joined in the condemnation of the British governor at St. Helena, Sir Hudson Lowe, as a petty, tyrannical bureaucrat and booby. Turning a scrupulous eye to the Hudson Lowe papers, Giles attempts to redeem Napoleon\u2019s jailer and guardian, reviled as he has been by critics on both sides of the Channel, from the judgment of history. What emerges is a more balanced view of both Lowe and Napoleon, condemned to each other on an island in the Atlantic for six years.",

The Boston Globe once called him \"the manic evangelist, grand guru, and scholarly professor of handicapping.\" His books espouse strategies and betting philosophies that have shaped the sport. But the true measure of Andrew Beyer's impact on handicapping is that his very name has become part of the horseplayer's terminology. Beyer's speed figures, first introduced almost twenty years ago in Picking Winners, revolutionized racetrack betting. But not until 1992, when the Daily Racing Form included Beyer Speed Figures in past performances, did they become widely available. Now, in Beyer on Speed, the author shows how to make speed figures the focal point of an effective betting strategy. Written in Beyer's clean, rapid-fire prose, Beyer on Speed explains how to relate speed figures to such factors as pace, track bias, and track conditions.",

And I learned how our great system can often discount the hardships and genuine suffering of such people -- and how it can sometimes seem to forget their struggle almost completely.  Before he was elected United States Senator from North Carolina in 1998, John Edwards worked as a lawyer for twenty years. Raised in a small town by parents who worked in the local mills, Edwards worked in those mills himself -- and then went on to become one of America's most successful and respected attorneys. During that time, he built a national reputation representing people whose lives had been shattered by corporate recklessness and grievous medical negligence. Often those battles took aim at entrenched powers backed by the kind of financial interests that made the chance of victory seem slim -- at least in the eyes of many. Yet in landmark cases, Edwards helped people from all walks of life stand up for themselves against tremendous odds.  Four Trials provides an electrifying account of four of his cases as it tells the story of the courageous and unmistakably decent people Edwards was privileged to represent in times of tragedy, great loss, and often great joy.  And in a deeply moving account, Four Trials also speaks of the tragedies and joys that Senator Edwards has known in his own life -- and how today life and justice are more precious to him than ever.",

        "Description": "For the 70 percent of couples who have been affected by extramarital affairs, this is the only book to offer proven strategies for surviving the crisis and rebuilding the relationship \u2013\u2013 written by a nationally known therapist considered an expert on infidelity. When I was 15, I was raped. That was nothing compared to your affair. The rapist was a stranger; you, I thought, were my best friend.   There is nothing quite like the pain and shock caused when a partner has been unfaithful. The hurt partner often experiences a profound loss of self\u2013respect and falls into a depression that can last for years. For the relationship, infidelity is often a death blow.  After the Affair is the first book to help readers survive this crisis. Written by a clinical psychologist who has been treating distressed couples for 22 years, it guides both hurt and unfaithful partners through the three stages of healing: Normalizing feelings, deciding whether to recommit and revitalizing the relationship. It provides proven, practical advice to help the couple change their behavior toward each other, cultivate trust and forgiveness and build a healthier, more conscious intimate partnership.",

An excited Packy breaks his parole and heads to Stowe, Vermont, to reclaim his loot. Once there, he is horrified to discover that his special tree will be heading to New York City the next morning. With a bumbling crew consisting of Jo-Jo, Benny, and an unsuccessful poet, Milo, he knows he has to act fast.  What Packy does not know is that Alvirah and Regan are on a weekend trip to Stowe with Alvirah's husband, Willy; Regan's fianc\u00e9, Jack; Regan's parents, Luke and Nora; and Alvirah's friend Opal, a lottery winner who lost all her winnings in Packy's scam. On Monday morning when they're supposed to head home, they learn that the tree is missing, Packy Noonan may be in the vicinity, and Opal has disappeared.  From two of America's beloved storytellers, The Christmas Thief is filled with suspense, comic characters, and holiday cheer, and is sure to delight its readers.",

A devastating new weapon of destruction. An unthinkable target. When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to his first assignment to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol -- seared into the chest of a murdered physicist -- he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati...the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy -- the Catholic Church. Langdon's worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican's holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair...a clandestine location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation. Critics have praised the exhilarating blend of relentless adventure, scholarly intrigue, and cutting wit found in Brown's remarkable thrillers featuring Robert Langdon. An explosive international suspense, Angels & Demons marks this hero's first adventure as it careens from enlightening epiphanies to dark truths as the battle between science and religion turns to war.",

        "Description": "The practice of prayer and meditation in modern Western Christianity is rooted in the Eastern tradition of early Church prayer as well as the wisdom of early Church fathers. In Centering Prayer, M. Basil Pennington, the author of the highly acclaimed Daily We Touch Him, returns to these roots, offering contemporary Christians a new approach to ancient prayer forms.Pennington combines the best of the Eastern spiritual exercises (such as the Jesus Prayer) with a spirituality for today's world. Addressing the obstacles that discourage people from praying well, he explains how to relax for prayer, how to listen to and be directed by the Other, and how to handle the pain and distractions that can stifle attempts to communicate with God. Centering Prayer has sold more than\u00a0a quarter million copies since it was first published in 1982. In this eminently practical book, simple, inspiring instructions will help readers find the comfort and the guidance they seek through prayer.",

A crook on a cross. A wild man in a cemetery. A five-time divorc\u00e9e. A despondent cripple. A grieving sister. A father at the end of his rope.Why are these portraits in the Bible? So we can look back in amazement at what Jesus did? No ... these aren't just Sunday school stories. They are historic moments in which a real God met real pain so we could answer the question. \"Does God care when I hurt?\"On every page of this powerfully moving book, Max Lucado reminds us, the God who spoke to Moses at the burning bush still speaks loudly to you today. The God who forgave King David still offers you forgiveness. The God who helped men and women in ages past still comes into your world, and he comes to do what you can't, to move the stone away so you can see his answer.",

Now, with While England Sleeps, available for the first time in two years, Leavitt moves beyond precisely controlled domestic drama to create a historical novel, one that has greater breadth and resonance than anything he has written before. Set against the rise of fascism in 1930s Europe, While England Sleeps tells the story of a love affair between the aristocratic young British writer Brian Botsford, who thinks homosexuality is something he will outgrow, and Edward Phelan, a sensitive and idealistic working-class employee of the London Underground and a Communist party member. When the strains of class difference, sexual taboo, and Brian's ambivalence impel Edward to volunteer to fight against Franco in Spain, Brian pursues him across Europe and into the violent chaos of war.",

The story of Songbird is told through the eyes of Mia, a beautiful Jewish teenager who loses everything in the onslaught of World War II: her upper-middle-class home in Lodz, Poland, her classical music studies, and her entire family who perishes at Auschwitz. Mia embarks on a perilous odyssey through war-torn Poland to join the ranks of a secret cadre of Jewish militia who have sworn to save their brethren, before escaping to Switzerland and then to America.  Determined to avenge her family's deaths, she leaves behind the man she loves and risks her life once more to return to Europe as a double agent and undermine the Germans in the final days of the war. Just when it seems that pain and loss will be her permanent companions, a surprising letter offers the prospect of a very different outcome.  Brimming with historical detail, passion, and intrigue, Songbird draws richly upon the author's own experiences as an American soldier in World War II, making history come alive with a unique freshness and emotional candor rarely ever seen in a first novel.",

        "Authors": "By Grayson, C. Jackson, Jr., O'Dell, Carla S., and Essaides, Nilly",
        "Description": "While companies search the world over to benchmark best practices, vast treasure troves of knowledge and know-how remain hidden right under their noses: in the minds of their own employees, in the often unique structure of their operations, and in the written history of their organizations. Now, acclaimed productivity and quality experts Carla O'Dell and Jack Grayson explain for the first time how applying the ideas of Knowledge Management can help employers identify their own internal best practices and share this intellectual capital throughout their organizations.  Knowledge Management (KM) is a conscious strategy of getting the right information to the right people at the right time so they can take action and create value. Basing KM on three major studies of best practices at one hundred companies, the authors demonstrate how managers can utilize a visual process model to actually transfer best practices from one business unit of the organization to another. Rich with case studies, concrete examples, and revealing anecdotes from companies including Texas Instruments, Amoco, Buckman, Chevron, Sequent Computer, the World Bank, and USAA, this valuable guide reveals how knowledge treasure chests can be unlocked to reduce product development cycle time, implement more cost-efficient operations, or create a loyal customer base. Finally, O'Dell and Grayson present three \"value propositions\" built around customers, products, and operations that could result in staggering payoffs as they did at the companies cited above.  No amount of knowledge or insight can keep a company ahead if it is not properly distributed where it's needed. Entirely accessible and immensely readable, If Only We Knew What We Know is a much-needed companion for business leaders everywhere.",

To help make ends meet while she waits for the insurance company to pay up, Alice takes a job as a real estate agent. The commissions have been nonexistent, but she does make a new friend, Charlie Hobbs, when she is sent in to try to buy his waterfront land for a developer.  Things have been tough for Alice, but they quickly become a nightmare when Ashley and Jamie don't come home on the school bus one day, and Alice gets a phone call from a woman claiming to have her children. When the kidnapper calls again and asks for a ransom identical to the amount Alice is due from the insurance agency for Eddie's accident, Alice forgoes contacting the police and instead calls Charlie for help. But as all sorts of people scheme to get their hands on her money, Alice wonders whether anyone can be trusted in her fight for everything she holds dear.  From the master of the suspense novel comes another gripping tale of mystery, money, and mayhem. Ed McBain skillfully weaves together his elegant plot and compelling characters, once again.",
