        "Title": "The China Price: The True Cost of Chinese Competitive Advantage",
        "Authors": "By Harney, Alexandra",
        "Description": "A landmark eyewitness expos? of how China's factory economy competes for Western business by selling out its workers, its environment, and its future  In The China Price, acclaimed Financial Times correspondent Alex Harney uncovers the truth about how China is able to offer such amazingly low prices to the rest of the world. What she has discovered is a brutal, Hobbesian world in which intense pricing pressure from Western companies combines with ubiquitous corruption and a lack of transparency to exact an unseen and unconscionable toll in human misery and environmental damage.  In a way, Harney shows, what goes on in China is inevitable. In a country with almost no transparency, where graft is institutionalized and workers have little recourse to the rule of law, incentives to lie about business practices vastly outweigh incentives to tell the truth. Harney reveals that despite a decade of monitoring factories, outsiders all too often have no idea of the conditions under which goods from China are made. She exposes the widespread practice of using a dummy or model factory as a company's false window out to the world, concealing a vast number of illegal factories operating completely off the books. Some Western companies are better than others about sniffing out such deception, but too many are perfectly happy to embrace plausible deniability as long as the prices remain so low. And in the gold-rush atmosphere that's infected the country, in which everyone is clamoring to get rich at once and corruption is rampant, it's almost impossible for the Chinese government's own underfunded regulatory mechanisms  to do much good at all.  But perhaps the most important revelation in The China Price is how fast change is coming, one way or another. A generation of Chinese flocked from the rural interior of the country to its coastline, where its factory work largely is, in the largest mass migration in human history. But that migration has slowed dramatically, in no small part because of widespread disenchantment with the way of life the factories offer. As pollution in China's industrial cities worsens and their infrastructure buckles, and grassroots activism for more legal recourse grows, pressures are mounting on the system that will not dissipate without profound change. Managing the violence of that change is the greatest challenge China faces in the near future, and managing its impact on the world economy is the challenge that faces us all.",

After nursing a broken engagement with Jane Austen novels and Absolut, Courtney Stone wakes up and finds herself   not in her Los Angeles bedroom or even in her own body, but inside the bedchamber of a woman in Regency   England.   Who but an Austen addict like herself could concoct such a fantasy?     Not only is Courtney stuck in another woman\u2019s life, she is forced to pretend she actually is that woman; and despite   knowing nothing about her, she manages to fool even the most astute observer. But not even her level of Austen   mania   has prepared Courtney for the chamber pots and filthy coaching inns of nineteenth-century England, let alone the   realities of being a single woman who must fend off suffocating chaperones, condom-less seducers, and marriages   of   convenience.     This looking-glass Austen world is not without its charms, however. There are journeys to Bath and London, balls in   the   Assembly Rooms, and the enigmatic Mr. Edgeworth, who may not be a familiar species of philanderer after all. But   when Courtney\u2019s borrowed brain serves up memories that are not her own, the ultimate identity crisis ensues. Will   she   ever get her real life back, and does she even want to?",

        "Description": "Fresh off the case of a deranged student who murdered his landlady, noted police investigator Porfiry Petrovich barely takes a breath before a bizarre and very grisly double murder lands him back on the streets of the tsarist St. Petersburg he knows all too well. The sardonic sleuth follows a trail from the drinking dens of the Haymarket district to an altogether more genteel stratum of society-a hunt that leads him to a conclusion even he will find shocking. In the tradition of such first-rate historical novels such as The Alienist and The Dante Club, The Gentle Axe is atmospheric and tense storytelling from its dramatic opening to its stunning climax.",

It has been years since the dirty laundry pile was less than three feet high, months since she remembered to have sex, and weeks since her toddler started using the trash can as a toilet. Lucy is living in a constant state of emergency, caught between perfectionist Yummy Mummy No. 1 and competitive Alpha Mum, making it hard for her to remember exactly why she exchanged her career and sanity for less than blissful domesticity. When she begins a flirtation with Sexy Domesticated Dad, a father from the school car-pool lane, the string of white lies to cover up the trail of chaos and illicit desire starts to unravel and disaster looms.Slummy Mummy\u00a0is a hilarious novel about the dilemmas of modern marriage and motherhood for those who never discovered their inner domestic goddess.

        "Description": "A military expert reveals how science fiction is fast becoming reality on the battlefield, changing not just how wars are fought, but also the politics, economics, laws, and ethics that surround war itself P. W. Singer?s previous two books foretold the rise of private military contractors and the advent of child soldiers? predictions that proved all too accurate. Now, he explores the greatest revolution in military affairs since the atom bomb?the advent of robotic warfare. We are just beginning to see a massive shift in military technology that threatens to make the stuff of I,Robot and the Terminator all too real. More than seven- thousand robotic systems are now in Iraq. Pilots in Nevada are remotely killing terrorists in Afghanistan. Scientists are debating just how smart?and how lethal?to make their current robotic prototypes. And many of the most renowned science fiction authors are secretly consulting for the Pentagon on the next generation. Blending historic evidence with interviews from the field, Singer vividly shows that as these technologies multiply, they will have profound effects on the front lines as well as on the politics back home. Moving humans off the battlefield makes wars easier to start, but more complex to fight. Replacing men with machines may save some lives, but will lower the morale and psychological barriers to killing. The ?warrior ethos,? which has long defined soldiers? identity, will erode, as will the laws of war that have governed military conflict for generations. Paradoxically, these new technologies will also bring war to our doorstep. As other nations and even terrorist organizations start to build or buy their own robotic weapons, the robot revolution could undermine America?s military preeminence. While his analysis is unnerving, there?s an irresistible gee-whiz quality to the innovations Singer uncovers. Wired for War travels from Iraq to see these robots in combat to the latter-day ?skunk works? in America?s suburbia, where tomorrow?s technologies of war are quietly being designed. In Singer?s hands, the future of war is as fascinating as it is frightening.",

That's what our parents encouraged us to become when we grew up. But Mom and Dad were wrong. The future belongs to a very different kind of person with a very different kind of mind. The era of \"left brain\" dominance, and the Information Age that it engendered, are giving way to a new world in which \"right brain\" qualities-inventiveness, empathy, meaning-predominate. That's the argument at the center of this provocative and original book, which uses the two sides of our brains as a metaphor for understanding the contours of our times.In the tradition of Emotional Intelligence and Now, Discover Your Strengths, Daniel H. Pink offers a fresh look at what it takes to excel. A Whole New Mind reveals the six essential aptitudes on which professional success and personal fulfillment now depend, and includes a series of hands-on exercises culled from experts around the world to help readers sharpen the necessary abilities.

Next he provides a questionnaire that helps you identify your own sources of pleasure and fulfillment. Finally, he illustrates the process with exciting design projects built on particular themes. The longing to entertain friends in a cozy cocktail room transforms an awkward space into a \u201cMartini Lounge\u201d; dreams of living by the seashore become \u201cCoastal Living\u201d; the desire for travel and theatrical surroundings informs \u201cMoroccan Mystique\u201d; and a nostalgia for the mid-twentieth century finds its creative expression in \u201cRetro Chic.\u201d Each of these imaginative rooms not only expresses the creative spirit, but also feeds the soul.As Lowell explains it, no matter what your budget, no matter what your talents, if you begin to understand the relationship between the interior of your mind and the interior of your home, you can create beauty in both. The sense of satisfaction promised by a home that you yourself decorated is not beyond your reach or your budget, if you follow the simple steps of America\u2019s favorite design guru.",

In a world of superficial values, peer pressure, and out-of-control consumerism, the world needs more GEEKs: Genuine, Enthusiastic, Empowered Kids. Today?s ?culture of cool? has changed the way kids grow up. Rather than enjoying innocent childhoods while developing strong, authentic characters, today?s kids can become cynical?even jaded?as they absorb the dangerous messages and harmful influences of a dominant popular culture that encourages materialism, high-risk behaviors, and a state of pseudo-adulthood. Author and mother of four Marybeth Hicks suggests an alternative: bringing up geeks. In this groundbreaking book, she shows parents how they can help their children gain the enthusiasm to pursue their passions, not just the latest fashions; the confidence to resist peer pressure and destructive behaviors; the love of learning that helps them excel at school and in life; and the maturity to value family as well as friends, as well as make good moral decisions.

        "Description": "Drawing on an unprecedented range and variety of sources, Hitler's Empire demands that we face the full implications of Hitler's takeover of Europe. Using twentieth-century technology to achieve nineteenth-century goals, Germany's forces achieved, in just a few years, the astounding domination of a landmass and population larger than that of the United States. Control of this vast territory was supposed to provide the basis for Germany's rise to unquestioned world power. Eastern Europe was to be the Reich's Wild West, transformed, pacified and civilized by massacre and colonial settlement. Western Europe was to provide the economic resources that would knit an authoritarian and racially cleansed continent together. But the brutality and short-sightedness of Nazi politics lost what German arms had won and brought their equally rapid downfall.Throughout this book are fascinating, chilling glimpses of the world that might have been. The genocide of the Jews was the harbinger of more killing ahead: Russians, Poles and other ethnic groups would have been slaughtered or enslaved en masse. Germans would have been settled upon now empty lands as far east as the Black Sea-the new \"Greater Germany.\" Europe's treasuries would have been systematically sacked, its great cities ransacked and recast as dormitories for forced laborers when they were not deliberately demolished. As dire as all this sounds, it was no more than the planned extension of what actually happened in Europe under Nazi rule, as recounted in this authoritative, absorbing account.",
