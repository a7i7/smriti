        "Description": "This inspired little book offers new, exciting and simple ways to serve up America's favorite combo: meat and potatoes. Along with basic recipes for making the perfect burger, grilling or panfrying a steak, or making mashed, boiled, fried or baked potatoes, Sharon Tyler Herbst gives us intensely flavorful, yet easy-to-follow recipes that range from Nutty Veal Nicoise, a fast and glorious dish that cooks in about ten minutes, to Potato Lasagne, a robust fusion of thin potato slices, a tomato-sausage bechamel and a basil-ricotta mixture.In the first third of the book, which Sharon devotes to meat, she shows us simple ways to make meatballs memorable (add a cup of provolone, jack or cheddar cheese); how to jazz up a flank steak (add port wine, chopped leeks, allspice, coriander and four ounces of Gorgonzola); or give pork chops an addictive twist (add plum preserves and beer). Without calling for fancy techniques, exotic ingredients or expensive cookware, she focuses on maximizing and combining flavors to produce fresh and enticing dishes. At the same time she suggest handy substitutes for tomato sauce and fresh herbs, as well as accompaniments such as Avocado Salsa, Ginger-Peanut Satay, and Minted Onion Marmalade.Sharon's recipes for potatoes are no less alluring - fabulous French Fries, creamy curried potatoes (perfect with simply grilled meat and a crisp green salad), a moist and tender Potato-Chive Focacci, soul-satisfying Spud Chili and Bourbon Smashed Sweets. Sharon even gives away the secret to perfect baked potatoes.The final portion of the book offers recipes for marvelous meat and potato combinations that concentrate and amplify the best features of each ingredient.Complete with charts and dozens of tips on identifying, buying, storing and safe handling, the book is crammed with everything there is to know about meat and potatoes. Renowned for her encyclopedic knowledge of cooking and her talent for fashioning inspired yet simple recipes, Sharon Herbst imbues this classic food combination with fresh interest and long-lasting appeal.",

The medications can make you nauseated, radiation can make your mouth sore, you can lose your taste from the disease or treatments, and the emotional upset can reduce your desire to eat.There's hope, though.

Instead, use this book and rediscover the pleasure, comfort, and healing power of eating.The Cancer Survival Cookbook offers nourishing recipes and practical suggestions to help in you recovery. Not only are the 200 nourishing meals, side dishes, snacks and desserts tasty and easy to make, but many feature simple options to add calories or other nutrients according to your needs. These unique tips for customizing recipes make them healthy choices the whole family can enjoy.This innovative book also includes extensive advice on overcoming specific eating problems such as nausea, appetite loss, and diarrhea, trustworthy information on herbal remedies, and appealing recipes for those who need soft diets.\"Donna Weihofen doesn't accept the idea that people with cancer should be limited in what they can eat. She made it possible for me to not only enjoy eating again, but to enjoy a variety of foods. I've been able to put on weight and I feel better\"\u2014Pat Syverud, cancer survivor",

        "Description": "\"Trudeau finds angles.\" --Jerry SeinfeldWhile millions of pilgrims flock to upstate New York for the 25th anniversary of Woodstock, Zonker flashes back to the original (acid triage, the bummer tent, Hendrix eating his guitar) with memories made all the more poignant by the fact that they're hallucinatory. His response to this revelation: \"Whoa! Do you suppose I wasn't at the moon landing either?\"While Zonk wasn't there, he is here, and here is surreal enough. Tobacco executives swearing under oath that smoking is as safe as eating Twinkies; Ollie North wrapping himself in a Confederate battle flag; and the president devolving into a flying waffle--who said the sixties had the corner on weirdness? As refreshing as a full pitcher of Kool-Aid, this mind-altering collection from G.B. Trudeau, Doonesbury Nation, is only the latest to pose the question: Is it real--or is it Doonesbury?",

Now she is determined to find out if her mother's \"accident\" was murder. What she finds instead is a man as transparent as air--sensual, muscular, his blue eyes burning into hers as she cries out one word from a place deep within her: David.David Ventris, Lord Ashthorpe, late of His Majesty's Light Dragoons, is, simply put, a ghost. He's waited two centuries to be called back to earth by the woman he wronged. He knew her as \"Sophie,\" a wondrous lady who sparked a passion so blazing that time could not dim the flames. Now he is being given the chance to guard her from danger and get back his soul--if only she will believe him real and not madness. If only she will love him enough to create a miracle...and give him life again.",

But the rich cheeses, heavy oils, and well-marbled meats have traditionally placed Italian food at the high end of the fat and calorie scales. Is it possible to slim down these delicious dishes yet retain the full flavor and authentic tastes of Italian cookery? Happily, the answer is yes!In this new collection, Glick and Baggett combine their 15 years' experience in designing rich-tasting yet low-fat recipes to capture all the abundance of Italian flavor while shifting the balance from high-fat ingredients to leaner, fresher foods and the wealth of reduced-fat products now available at supermarkets.Skinny Italian Cooking covers the gamut from classic dishes and regional specialties to delicious appetizers, soups, pizzas, desserts, and - in its usual starring role - pasta, with a huge range of savory sauces. The recipes also have been modified to fit busy schedules: most can be prepared in 45 minutes or less, and many include timesaving microwave and food processor shortcuts.Now you can go Italian without guilt, and serve hearty family meals, elegant party dishes and delightful fun foods that are as good for you as they are delicious to eat. Virtually all recipes conform to American Heart Association guidelines, not exceeding 30% of calories from fat. Nutritional data and diabetic exchanges follow each recipe.",

As she investigates the mysterious disappearance of her own peacenik mother, Willa finds herself doing the Havana Twist.  Attorney Willa Jansson has finally managed to unload some of her sixties baggage, but her rebellious mother can't seem to mellow out. When Mom heads to Cuba with a band of graying \"brigadistas\" Willa figures it's just a pilgrimage to lefty Graceland. But then the rest of the group returns without her mother, and Willa fears the worst. Risking disbarment for \"trading with the enemy\" she rushes to the rescue -- and discovers that her mother may have finally gotten herself into more trouble then she can get herself out of.  In a deadly game of cat and mouse, Willa follows her mother's path from Havana to Mexico City, from California back to Havana, getting manipulated, misled, and nearly arrested along the way. Soon she finds two angry governments, at least one ruthless killer, and her old flame, homicide Lieutenant Surgelato, are hot on her trail. Racing against time, Willa realizes that, much more than politics and police work, it is intuition that will help her find her mother -- and those things that only a daughter knows.",

        "Authors": "By Landau, Diana (EDT), Stump, Shelley (EDT), and California Center for Wildlife (COR)",
        "Description": "Based on years of practical experience and research, and informed by the California Center for Wildlife's commitment to humane treatment of animals, Living with Wildlife traces the evolution of attitudes toward wildlife and provides sensible guidelines for co-existing with animals encountered around the home and in wild areas. It is both a comprehensive reference to common North American wildlife and a guide to resolving - in the most humane ways possible - common conflicts that arise from human-wildlife contact. Included are invaluable tips on what to do when:You head up to the attic to investigate strange noises, and find that a family of raccoons has taken up residence there Your prized rosebush is suffering from nightly \"pruning\" by deer Your child rushes into the house holding a fledgling bird found on the lawn after it apparently fell from its nest You find, upon returning from a day hike while camping in bear country, that your food supplies have been raided and are scattered all over the campsite Throughout, the book encourages humans to share their habitat and suggests ways to make residential environments more hospitable to wildlife.",
