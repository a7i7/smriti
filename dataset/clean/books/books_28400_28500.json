        "Description": "From international bestseller Stephen King, a high-concept, ingenious and terrifying story about the mayhem unleashed when a pulse from a mysterious source transforms all cell phone users into homicidal maniacs.There\u2019s a reason cell rhymes with hell.  On October 1, God is in His heaven, the stock market stands at 10,140, most of the planes are on time, and Clayton Riddell, an artist from Maine, is almost bouncing up Boylston Street in Boston. He\u2019s just landed a comic book deal that might finally enable him to support his family by making art instead of teaching it. He\u2019s already picked up a small (but expensive!) gift for his long-suffering wife, and he knows just what he\u2019ll get for his boy Johnny. Why not a little treat for himself? Clay\u2019s feeling good about the future.  That changes in a hurry. The cause of the devastation is a phenomenon that will come to be known as The Pulse, and the delivery method is a cell phone. Everyone\u2019s cell phone. Clay and the few desperate survivors who join him suddenly find themselves in the pitch-black night of civilization\u2019s darkest age, surrounded by chaos, carnage, and a human horde that has been reduced to its basest nature...and then begins to evolve.  There\u2019s really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points home to Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north they begin to see crude signs confirming their direction. A promise, perhaps. Or a threat...  There are 193 million cell phones in the United States alone. Who doesn\u2019t have one? Stephen King\u2019s utterly gripping, gory, and fascinating novel doesn\u2019t just ask the question \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d It answers it with a vengeance.",

Hard Time is the work of a master--a riveting novel of suspense that is indisputably Paretsky's best V.I. Warshawski novel yet. Multimedia conglomerate Global Entertainment has purchased the Chicago Herald-Star, forcing the paper's staff to scramble to stay employed. Reporter Murray Ryerson, V.I.'s longtime friend and sometime rival, manages to reinvent himself as the host of a television show on Global's network. On her way home from a party celebrating Murray's debut, V.I. almost runs over a woman lying in the street. Stopping to help, V.I. soon learns that her Good Samaritan act will drop her squarely in a boiling intrigue. In a case that forces her to go head-to-head with one of the world's largest providers of private security and prison services, a case that exposes dark hidden truths behind the razzle-dazzle of the entertainment industry, V.I. will be ahead of the game if she gets out alive.",

She begins with a discussion of how societal images of older women constrict their sense of worth and their possibilities. The author then suggests ways in which older women can embrace new visions of themselves. She proceeds to explore the place of transitions, the inner life, contemplation, the body, mourning, remembering, caregiving and intergenerational connections as each relates to women's spirituality in later life. At each chapter's end, Dr. Fischer offers rituals, prayers and meditations that mark the passages of the second half of life.",

Given the level of interest in Mexico\u2014likely to increase still more as a result of the recent liberalization of trade policies\u2014this volume will be useful in affording U.S. readers an intelligent, comprehensive, and accessible study of their neighbor to the south.",

There they hide a magnificent treasure more vast than that of any pharaoh. Then they disappear, leaving only a great stone demon to guard their hoard.In 1578 the legendary Sir Francis Drake captures a Spanish galleon filled with Inca gold and silver and the key to the lost treasure, which included a gigantic chain of gold that belonged to the last Inca king, a masterpiece of ancient technology so huge that it requires two hundred men to lift it. As the galleon is sailed by Drake's crew back to England, an underwater earthquake causes a massive tidal wave that sweeps it into the jungle. Only one man survives to tell the tale....In 1998 a group of archaeologists is nearly drowned while diving into the depths of a sacrificial pool high in the Andes of Peru. They are saved by the timely arrival of Dirk Pitt, who is in the area on a marine expedition. Pitt soon finds out that his life has been placed in jeopardy as well by smugglers intent on uncovering the lost ancient Incan treasure. Soon, he, his faithful companions, and Dr. Shannon Kelsey, a beautiful young archaeologist, are plunged into a vicious, no-holds-barred struggle to survive.From then on it becomes a battle of wits in a race against time and danger to find the golden chain, as Pitt finds himself caught up in a struggle with a sinister international family syndicate that deals in stolen works of art, the smuggling of ancient artifacts, and art forgery worth many hundreds of millions of dollars. The clash between the art thieves, the FBI and the Customs Service, a tribe of local Indians, and Pitt, along with his friends from NUMA, two of whom are captured and threatened with execution, rushes toward a wild climax in a subterranean world of darkness and death - for the real key to the mystery, as it turns out, is a previously unknown, unexplored underground river that runs through the ancient treasure chamber.Inca Gold is Clive Cussler - and Dirk Pitt - at their very best.",

Leanne knows it's a hit, and with the instincts that have made her reputation and jeopardized her career, she pinpoints the prime suspect: Joe Curtis. She believes that Curtis will lead her to a cache of stolen arms, and to charismatic cult leader Father Amon, who is preparing his acolytes for Armageddon in their last sanctuary.To Leanne, a born hunter who was taught to respect her prey, Joe Curtis has become an obsession, an alter ego. With a gut feeling that they are destined to meet, she coolly tracks Joe, a loner and a survivor like herself, on a relentless cat-and-mouse chase from Boise to Seattle to the icy grandeur of Alaska. Here, on a silent, glacier-strewn landscape, the two come face-to-face in an explosive encounter that ultimately drives Leanne underground and undercover, into Father Amon's sanctuary.

        "Description": "Since the third edition of The Oxford Companion to the Theatre appeared in 1967, theatre throughout the world, and especially in European and all English-speaking countries, has undergone a series of changes swifter and more far-reaching than at any other time in its history. While maintaining the primary purpose of preceding editions in providing a solid survey of the development of the theatre from its beginnings in primitive ritual to the present day in all countries that have a continuing theatrical tradition, this new edition offers more information on contemporary writers, directors, players, companies, and theatres, both metropolitan and regional. An extensive system of cross-referencing leads the reader to entries containing related information, and a generous bibliography offers aguidance on further reading. Entries dealing with technical subjects emphasize the historical perspective, throwing light on the remarkable accomplishments of earlier practitioners of theatrical illusion: they are illustrated where necessary with diagrams. Over 200 other illustrations are placed in thematically-arranged groups: functioning independently of the text, they show the changes of vision brought to bear on theatrical production over more than 2000 years.",

With her last novel, Dreamships, she broke into hardcover to widespread acclaim, taking her place among the established names in the field. \"A thoughtful, challenging story,\" said Elizabeth A. Lynn. \"She creates a complex world, and her characters are believable and subtle. This is a talent to watch.\"Now, in Burning Bright, Scott tells a passionate, colorful tale of love and death, her best yet. Setting her tale on the free-port planet of Burning Bright, nexus of trade, politically balanced between the human and Hsai empires in space, and center of virtual-reality-gaming for all of civilization, Scott weaves a network of intrigue and suspense.When spacepilot and ambitious young game designer Quinn Lioe gets shore leave on Burning Bright, determined to play the game at its brilliant center, she becomes enmeshed in the conflict between two great empires, a key figure upon whom the fates of fortunes turn.Once again, Scott constructs a brilliantly complex future society and tells a story that involves the mind and the heart.

        "Description": "\"The truth, we are told, will make us free.\u00a0\u00a0 It is time to free Catholics, lay as well as clerical, from the structures of deceit that are our subtle modern form of papal sin.\u00a0\u00a0Paler, subtler, less dramatic than the sins castigated by Orcagna or Dante, these are the quiet sins of intellectual betrayal.\"--from the IntroductionFrom Pulitzer Prize-winning author Garry Wills comes an assured, acutely insightful--and occasionally stinging--critique of the Catholic Church and its hierarchy from the nineteenth century to the present.Papal Sin in the past was blatant, as Catholics themselves realized when they painted popes roasting in hell on their own church walls.\u00a0\u00a0Surely, the great abuses of the past--the nepotism, murders, and wars of conquest--no longer prevail; yet, the sin of the modern papacy, as revealed by Garry Wills in his penetrating new book, is every bit as real, though less obvious than the old sins. Wills describes a papacy that seems steadfastly unwilling to face the truth about itself, its past, and its relations with others.\u00a0\u00a0The refusal of the authorities of the Church to be honest about its teachings has needlessly exacerbated original mistakes.\u00a0\u00a0Even when the Vatican has tried to tell the truth--e.g., about Catholics and the Holocaust--it has ended up resorting to historical distortions and evasions.\u00a0\u00a0The same is true when the papacy has attempted to deal with its record of discrimination against women, or with its unbelievable assertion that \"natural law\" dictates its sexual code.Though the blithe disregard of some Catholics for papal directives has occasionally been attributed to mere hedonism or willfulness, it actually reflects a failure, after long trying on their part, to find a credible level of honesty in the official positions adopted by modern popes.\u00a0\u00a0On many issues outside the realm of revealed doctrine, the papacy has made itself unbelievable even to the well-disposed laity. The resulting distrust is in fact a neglected reason for the shortage of priests.\u00a0\u00a0Entirely aside from the public uproar over celibacy, potential clergy have proven unwilling to put themselves in a position that supports dishonest teachings.Wills traces the rise of the papacy's stubborn resistance to the truth, beginning with the challenges posed in the nineteenth century by science, democracy, scriptural scholarship, and rigorous history.\u00a0\u00a0The legacy of that resistance, despite the brief flare of John XXIII's papacy and some good initiatives in the 1960s by the Second Vatican Council (later baffled), is still strong in the Vatican.Finally Wills reminds the reader of the positive potential of the Church by turning to some great truth tellers of the Catholic tradition--St. Augustine, John Henry Newman, John Acton, and John XXIII.\u00a0\u00a0In them, Wills shows that the righteous path can still be taken, if only the Vatican will muster the courage to speak even embarrassing truths in the name of Truth itself.",
