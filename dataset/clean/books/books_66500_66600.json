And I am different, Kitty, whether anyone wants to admit it or not.\" \"But, Cara,--it just seems like tonight you set out deliberately to cause trouble.\" \"Even you don\u2019t understand, do you, Kitty?\" \"I do, I mean I'm trying to. You're my twin, I want to understand!\" \"Yes, I know we're twins, but who am I?\" demanded Cara hotly. \"We're not like paper dolls cut out of the same cardboard!\" Although identical in appearance, the Cameron twins were dramatically different in temperament. Cara, vivacious, adventurous. Kitty, sensitive, introspective. But these differences had never kept them from being each other's best friend, confidante, and close companion; that is -- until one fateful summer -- the summer everything changed. It began as a carefree vacation at Cape Cod; a summer filled with sailing, swimming, shell-searching, dances, and parties. But slowly Kitty starts to suspect that her twin is keeping something from her. Puzzled, hurt, and more than a little resentful, Kitty longs to find out what it is. But something hidden in her own heart prevents her from doing so, because Kitty has her own secret she cannot share.",

        "Authors": "By Persico, Joseph E.",
        "Description": "November 11, 1918. The final hours pulsate with tension as every man in the trenches hopes to escape the melancholy distinction of being the last to die in World War I. The Allied generals knew the fighting would end precisely at 11:00 A.M, yet in the final hours they flung men against an already beaten Germany. The result? Eleven thousand casualties suffered\u2013more than during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Why? Allied commanders wanted to punish the enemy to the very last moment and career officers saw a fast-fading chance for glory and promotion.  Joseph E. Persico puts the reader in the trenches with the forgotten and the famous\u2013among the latter, Corporal Adolf Hitler, Captain Harry Truman, and Colonels Douglas MacArthur and George Patton. Mainly, he follows ordinary soldiers\u2019 lives, illuminating their fate as the end approaches. Persico sets the last day of the war in historic context with a gripping reprise of all that led up to it, from the 1914 assassination of the Austrian archduke, Franz Ferdinand, which ignited the war, to the raw racism black doughboys endured except when ordered to advance and die in the war\u2019s last hour. Persico recounts the war\u2019s bloody climax in a cinematic style that evokes All Quiet on the Western Front, Grand Illusion, and Paths of Glory.The pointless fighting on the last day of the war is the perfect metaphor for the four years that preceded it, years of senseless slaughter for hollow purposes. This book is sure to become the definitive history of the end of a conflict Winston Churchill called \u201cthe hardest, cruelest, and least-rewarded of all the wars that have been fought.\u201d",

While Rhoan is an exalted guardian, a.k.a. assassin, Riley is merely an office worker\u2013until her brother goes missing on one of his missions. The timing couldn\u2019t be worse. More werewolf than vampire, Riley is vulnerable to the moon heat, the weeklong period before the full moon, when her need to mate becomes all-consuming.\u2026Luckily Riley has two willing partners to satisfy her every need. But she will have to control her urges if she\u2019s going to find her brother\u2026.Easier said than done as the city pulses with frenzied desire, and Riley is confronted with a very powerful\u2013and delectably naked\u2013vamp who raises her temperature like never before.In matters carnal, Riley has met her match. But in matters criminal, she must follow her instincts not only to find her brother but to stop an unholy harvest. For someone is doing some shifty cloning in an attempt to produce the ultimate warrior\u2013by tapping into the genome of nonhumans like Rhoan. Now Riley knows just how dangerous the world is for her kind\u2013and just how much it needs her.From the Hardcover edition.",

I\u2019ll see you guys later!\u201d They were the last words Lois Duncan would ever hear her daughter speak. On a balmy midsummer\u2019s night in 1989, eighteen-year-old Kaitlyn Arquette was shot to death as she drove home along a deserted strip of new Mexico highway. The police called it a random shooting\u2014even though it had all the earmarks of a professional hit. . . . Who would put out a contract on a beautiful young honor student? Was it grief that made Kaitlyn\u2019s Vietnamese lover try to take his own life?\u2014or was it not an attempted suicide at all? Lois Duncan\u2019s search for answers would take her into the underworld of Vietnamese gangs that stretched across three states. It would lead her to an extraordinary psychic and to a courageous journalist determined to expose the devastating truth. And it would send her on a numbing odyssey into Kaitlyn\u2019s shocking secret life as she desperately sought justice for the daughter she would always love . . . even in the face of shattering betrayal and threats to her own life. . . .  Praise for Who Killed My Daughter?\u201cDuncan\u2019s anguish and frustration surface on practically every page of this sad but intriguing mystery. Her forays into the realm of psychics and dreams are downright eerie.\u201d\u2014The Plain Dealer \u201cWho Killed My Daughter? is a story of sadness, frustration and hope. . . .

        "Description": "Every year, almost 11 million Americans are wheeled through the doors of the mysterious world of a hospital operating room, where a team of specialists perform one of scores of medical procedures. Some are routine, others are astoundingly complicated and delicate, but all are absolutely fascinating.In this gripping, minute-by-minute account of 24 hours in the operating suite of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, Pulitzer Prize-winning Newsday correspondent B. D. Colen takes us into the windowless, tile-walled realm that patients see for only a short while before the anesthesiologist puts them to sleep. This is the vividly detailed portrait of a world in which both the mysterious and the miraculous are all in a day's work ... and of the real men and women who daily face these split-second, life-and-death decisions. We hear their stories and share their triumphs and their tragedies. We watch a plastic surgeon lovingly reconstruct a baby's severe cleft palate, correcting one of nature's mistakes. We share the fears of a woman whose radical cancer surgery may leave her unable to use her vocal cords. We witness a bullet being removed from a teenager's brain. We view with awe as doctors employ high-tech fiber optics, using a miniature video camera and TV monitor to guide their scalpels during abdominal surgery. We watch an emergency coronary bypass, an amputation, and a wide variety of other operations.We also meet the people behind the masks the doctors, nurses, and anesthesiologists who make up this dedicated staff. There is head nurse Diane Potenza, the no-nonsense den mother of the O.R. who puts both residents and chiefs of staff in their places ... Tony Tortolani, who has overcome his working-class background and the objections of prejudiced teachers to become a top cardiac surgeon ... Nancy Epstein, a second-generation neurosurgeon who has battled fierce sexism in a male-dominated profession ... and anesthesiologist Rob LaPorta, the first member of his family to attend college and a man who is not afraid to talk openly about the sometimes conflicting motivations that drive physicians. Through these people, who are at once extraordinary and ordinary, Colen reveals the complicated mosaic that is daily life in a modern operating room.",

        "Description": "Not since his runaway bestseller, The Cardinal Sins, has Father Andrew Greeley written such a searing and topical novel about the state of the Catholic Church.The Priestly Sins tells the story of Father Herman Hoffman, a gifted and innocent young man from the distant prairies of the Great Plains. In the summer of his first parish appointment, Hoffman is swept up in the Crisis after witnessing child abuse in the parish rectory. He tells the pastor, the father of the victim, and the local police but is rebuffed by the archbishop. Soon he is vilified for denouncing a priest who has been \"cleared\" by the police and learns the harsh fate of the whistleblower in the contemporary Catholic church: he is locked up in a mental-health center and then sent into exile to do graduate study. In Chicago to study immigrant history, he encounters the local \"Vicar for Extern Priests,\" the legendary monsignor Blackie Ryan, who helps him regain his confidence. Hoffman returns home to demand a parish of his own from the archbishop. Reluctantly, the church hierarchy assigns him to a dying parish, but by his zeal and charm he revives the local church. His brief idyll is shattered by a subpoena to testify in a court hearing. If he speaks, he will have to take on the \"downtown\" establishment that is determined to destroy him and many of his fellow priests who want to be rid of this painful reminder of a sinful past. He faces exile not only from his parish but from the priesthood itself.Written from the author's fifty years of experience as a priest, The Priestly Sins will be criticized by some but embraced by most for this all-too-candid story of all-too-human priests. The Priestly Sins is Father Greeley's most electrifying novel in three decades.",

With these eerie ingredients, bestselling master John Saul once again works his unique brand of sinister magic to conjure an unforgettable tale of unspeakable terror.For most of her young life, thirteen-year-old Angel Sullivan has been on the outside looking in, enduring the taunts of cruel schoolmates and the angry abuse of a bitter father. Then Angel\u2019s family moves to the quaint town of Roundtree, Massachusetts\u2014where a charming home is available, a promising job awaits Angel\u2019s unemployed father, and most of all, the chance to make a new start beckons to the shy, hopeful teenager. But when she is shunned by her new classmates, Angel falls deeper into despair. Until she meets Seth Baker, a fellow outcast\u2014and a fateful kinship is forged. It\u2019s Seth who tells Angel the unspoken truth about the legacy of murder that hangs over her family\u2019s home\u2014and the whispered rumors that something supernatural still dwells there. Uncertain whether the stories are true, and desperate to escape the torment of their daily lives, Angel and Seth devote themselves to contacting whatever restless soul haunts the dark recesses of Black Creek Crossing. But once they have begun, there is no turning back. Guided by an anguished and vengeful spirit, they uncover the shocking events and centuries-old horrors that lay buried beneath the placid veneer of Roundtree. And along with the ghastly revelations comes a terrifying power\u2014one that feeds upon the rage of the victimized, turning the basest impulses and most dangerous desires into devastating weapons. Now, the closer Angel and Seth are pushed toward the edge by their tormentors, the deeper they descend into the maelstrom of dark forces they\u2019ve unleashed . . . and the more unspeakable the hour of reckoning will be.",

What do angels look like? Whom do they choose to visit? Why do they appear more often to children than to adults? An eloquent report from the place where earth and heaven meet, A BOOK OF ANGELS is a quest into mysteries and a song of praise to life.\"A BOOK OF ANGELS is a kind of timeless tour, led by ordinary people who've met angels, and extraordinary writers who've set down ageless thoughts: Milton, Dante, Goethe, Shakespeare, Blake, Rilke, Dostoevsky, Swedenborg, and Poe, along with passages from the Bible and Koran.\"--Los Angeles Times\"Like all good books, it exceeds the subject and illuminates the tough, tiring, and sometimes miraculous business of living, where angels sometimes help out....The visible and invisible dance with each other continually and as far as angels are concerned, now you see them, now you don't.

And it's Lynn who, with her special way of viewing the world, teaches Katie to look beyond tomorrow.

Meanwhile, Communism has receded from Europe; and Poland, like other countries, is struggling to rebuild its economy and society. Against this backdrop of a culture in transition Leszek becomes an amateur sleuth, gathering clues. His investigation leads him to confront the former state apparatchiks and the Church's pious and impotent priests. A series of strange thefts - stones from the foundations of old houses - may or may not be connected to Tomek's murder. As Leszek moves closer to the truth he realizes that larger forces - ancient prejudices and blood feuds - are ultimately at the root of this mystery. He recognizes, too, that the answer to the puzzle will be found in the dark woods that sprawl beyond the town, where the past and the present come together in the novel's surprising and powerful climax.",

Richard Daniel Starrett was the dangerous visitor for too many unlucky young women in Georgia and South Carolina in the late 1980s. Answering \u201cfor sale\u201d ads in the classifieds, he was a buyer hunting for victims, not bargains, and he paid in grim coin: rape, kidnapping, murder. \u00a0 Because of his articulate intelligence and prestigious job, no one suspected this \u201cgolden boy\u201d of such heinous acts. This gripping, intimately detailed account by Pulitzer Prize-winning authors probes every tortured thought and twisted urge of a \u201cboy-next-door murderer\u201d\u2014as well as the dynamics of the model family that shaped him. The result is both a stunning portrait of a diseased mind and the moving story of a loving family\u2019s emotional nightmare and painful disintegration.",

Now Parker presents Spenser with a deceptively dangerous and multi-layered case: Someone has been killing racehorses at stables across the south, and the Boston P.I. travels to Georgia to protect the two-year-old destined to become the next Secretariat. When Spenser is approached by Walter Clive, president of Three Fillies Stables, to find out who is threatening his horse Hugger Mugger, he can hardly say no: He's been doing pro bono work for so long his cupboards are just about bare. Disregarding the resentment of the local Georgia law enforcement, Spenser takes the case. Though Clive has hired a separate security firm, he wants someone with Spenser's experience to supervise the operation.Despite a veneer of civility, Spenser encounters tensions beneath the surface southern gentility. The case takes an even more deadly turn when the attacker claims a human victim, and Spenser must revise his impressions of the whole Three Fillies organization--and watch his own back as well.With razor-sharp dialogue, eloquently spare prose, and some of the best supporting characters to grace the printed page, Hugger Mugger is grand entertainment.",
