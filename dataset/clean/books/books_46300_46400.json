        "Description": "'Journey over all the universe in a map, without the expense and fatigue of traveling, without suffering the inconveniences of heat, cold, hunger, and thirst.' --Miguel de Cervantes, in Don Quixote From the earliest of times, maps have fired our imaginations and helped us make sense of our world, from the global to the very local.  Head of Map Collections at the British Library, Peter Barber has here compiled an historic and lavish atlas, charting the progress of civilization as our knowledge of the world expanded. Simply organized as a progression through time, The Map Book collects some 175 maps that span four millennia - from the famed prehistoric Bedolina (Italy) incision in rock from around 1500 B.C. to the most modern, digitally enhanced rendering.  Many of the maos are beautiful works of art in their own right.  From Europe to the Americas, Africa to Asia, north to south, there are maps of oceans and continents charted by heroic adventurers sailing into the unknown, as accounts spread of new discoveries, shadowy continents begin to appear n the margins of the world, often labeled 'unknown lands.'  Other maps had a more practical use: some demarcated national boundaries or individual plots of land; military plans depicted enemy positions; propaganda treatises showed one country or faction at an advantage over others. So much history resides in each map--cultural, mythological, navigational--expressing the unlimited extent of human imagination.  This is captured in the accompanying texts--mini essays by leading map historians--that are as vivid and insightful as the maps themselves.  They make The Map Book as much a volume to be read as to be visually admired.",

        "Description": "?Rarely have more profound changes in American foreign policy been called for than today,\u201d begins Amitai Etzioni in the preface to this book. Yet Etzioni\u2019s concern is not to lay blame for past mistakes but to address the future: What can now be done to improve U.S. relations with the rest of the world?What should American policies be toward recently liberated countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan, or rogue states like North Korea and Iran? When should the United States undertake humanitarian intervention abroad? What must be done to protect America from nuclear terrorism? The author asserts that providing basic security must be the first priority in all foreign policy considerations, even ahead of efforts to democratize. He sets out essential guidelines for a foreign policy that makes sense in the real world, builds on moral principles, and creates the possibility of establishing positive relationships with Muslim nations and all others.Etzioni has considered the issues deeply and for many years. His conclusions fall into no neat categories?neither ?liberal\u201d nor ?conservative\u201d?for he is guided not by ideology but by empirical evidence and moral deliberation. His proposal rings with the sound of reason, and this important book belongs on the reading list of every concerned leader, policy maker, and voter in America.",

        "Authors": "By Tieger, Paul D. and Barron-Tieger, Barbara",
        "Description": "Every parent knows that children, even babies, have distinct personalities. Any parent with more than one child is probably well aware of how different from each other children, even siblings, can be. So it's only natural that the parenting strategies that work with one child may be less effective with another child. How can you be sure that your nurturing is well suited to your child?With this one-of-a-kind parenting guide, you can use Personality Type analysis - a powerful and well-respected psychological tool - to understand your child better and become a more effective parent. In Nurture by Nature you'll learn which of 16 distinctly different types best matches your child's personality; how this personality type affects your child in each of the three stages of development - preschool, school age, and adolescence; how other parents, whose experiences are recounted in scores of case studies, deal with a wide array of challenging situations you may encounter: reining in a preschooler whose boundless energy constantly gets him into trouble; communicating with a child who keeps her thoughts and feelings secret; understanding an adolescent who seems not to care that he is forever losing things (his homework, his baseball cap, his keys); broadening the horizons of a child who resists trying anything new or unfamiliar...; and how you can adapt your parenting style to your child's type - and get better results when communicating, supporting, motivating, and disciplining.Whether your child is a tantrum-prone toddler, a shy third-grader, a rebellious teen, or somewhere in between, Nurture by Nature will give you the power to understand why children are the way they are - and to become the best parent you can be.",

        "Description": "he suppression of Tibet\u2019s cultural heritage has the potential to set a precedent for all oppressed peoples of the world. Perched on the top of the world. changes in Tibet\u2019s ecosystem affect the entire global climate. And, most importantly, Tibet is the spiritual and physical home of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, to which he can never return.But why does Tibet matter to you? Tibet is more than its mountains, its monks, and its martyrs. Robert Thurman, renowned Tibetan scholar, teacher, and activist, presents his provocative, five-point plan that will enable China to win the respect of the entire world by allowing Tibet to regain its cultural, economic, and political autonomy. Thurman shows how the Dalai Lama's tireless work is the harbinger of peace for the world yet to come and essential for human survival. The book outlines several key factors that will educate and empower readers to take action:- What is the history of Tibet, and how do the political, religious, ecological, and social factors affect each other?- Who is the Dalai Lama, and why does his work matter to the world?- What does the China-Tibet relationship represent for the global community?- What can individuals do to bring attention to this issue, and make a change where they are?- How can the five-point plan be used as a model of peaceful change in the world?",

But traditional capitalism cannot solve problems  like inequality and poverty, because it is hampered  by a narrow view of human nature in which people are  one-dimensional beings concerned only with profit.  In fact, human beings have many other drives and  passions, including the spiritual, the social, and the  altruistic. Welcome to the world of social business, where  the creative vision of the entrepreneur is applied to  today's most serious problems: feeding the poor, housing  the homeless, healing the sick, and protecting the planet.  Creating a World Without Poverty tells the stories of  some of the earliest examples of social businesses,  including Yunus's own Grameen Bank. It reveals the next  phase in a hopeful economic and social revolution that is  already under way?and in the worldwide effort to eliminate  poverty by unleashing the productive energy of every  human being.",

Are people in Switzerland happier because it is the most democratic country in the world? Do citizens of Qatar, awash in petrodollars, find joy in all that cash?  Is the King of Bhutan a visionary for his initiative to calculate Gross National Happiness? Why is Asheville, North Carolina so damn happy?

        "Description": "Harold Bloom, our preeminent literary critic, essays to explain the meaning of angels in world literature In this lovely gift book published for the holiday season, Harold Bloom again combines his lifelong interests in religion and literature. He begins by observing our present-day obsession with angels, which reached its greatest intensity as the current millennium approached. For the most part, these popular angels are banal, even insipid. Bloom is especially concerned with a particular subspecies of angels: fallen angels.\u00a0 He proceeds to examine representations of fallen angels from Zoroastrian texts and the Bible to Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost to Tony Kushner\u2019s Angels in America, arguing that familiarity with this rich literary tradition improves our reading and spiritual lives. Bloom\u2019s text is accompanied by more than a dozen original watercolors, line drawings, and illuminated letters by award-winning artist Mark Podwal.Every angel is terrifying, Rilke wrote. For Bloom, too, this is true in one sense, since he maintains that all angels are fallen angels. The image of Satan, the greatest of fallen angels, retains the ability to fascinate and frighten us, he argues, because we share a close kinship\u00a0with him. Indeed, from a human perspective, we must agree that we are fallen angels. Fallenness is ultimately a human condition: the recognition of our own mortality. Throughout world literature angels have always served as metaphors for death. We may take consolation, however, in our double awareness that angels also represent love and the celebration of human possibilities.",

And with the advent of radio, television, and satellite broadcasts, Graham has reached more than two billion people in his lifetime. Billy Graham: God's Ambassador includes hundreds of photos from the archives of Graham's photographer, Russ Busby, along with quotes, comments, and personal reflections from the past half century, most of them in the words of Graham himself and those who have been the closest to him. Unlike any other book ever published on his life and ministry, this insightful edition captures Graham the advocate, preaching for human rights and world peace; Graham the counselor, with presidents and world leaders; Graham the inspirer, a positive influence in times of conflict and discord; and Graham the husband and father, at home with his family. This unique, once-in-a-lifetime volume beautifully captures the public and private moments of one of the world's most prominent figures, and certainly the most influential Christian of the twentieth century.",

        "Description": "An oral history of the twentieth century in America.By 1990, over 37,000 Americans had lived to the age of one hundred. Their lives spanned world wars, the Depression, the rise and demise of the great Red Menace, and the emergence of the United States as a world power.Through interviews with centenarians across the country, Bernard Edelman draws a dazzling portrait of Americans in the twentieth century, evoking the work ethic of rural farms, the nation's awe at inventions such as the automobile, and the collective despair at the onset of world war. These recollections are a treasure of the century's social history. The young immigrant survivor who can still smell the smoke of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. The rookie pitcher who struck out the first batter he ever faced in the big leagues: Ty Cobb. The dashing artillery officer who won a Silver Star in the Great War. The officer in the Quartermaster Corps who witnessed the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. The motorcycle racer who barnstormed the nation, setting records that will never be broken. The feisty woman who led a walkout at the premiere of Gone With the Wind. The man who invented Pampers.Their memories serve as a timeless reminder of life in twentieth-century America.",

        "Description": "After three years of sipping, spitting, and slogging her way through bushy vine leaves and cellar cobwebs, award-winning writer Natalie MacLean takes readers behind the scenes of the international wine world, exploring its history, visiting its most evocative places, and meeting some of its most charismatic personalities. In Red, White, and Drunk All Over, Natalie travels to the ancient vineyards of Burgundy to uncover the secrets of the pinot noir, the \"heartbreak grape\" from which some of the most coveted and expensive wines in the world are made. She visits the labyrinthine cellars of Champagne to examine the myths and the mystique of luxury bubbly and the grandes dames who made it the drink of celebration the world over. She pulls on sturdy boots to help with the harvest at the vineyards of iconoclastic Californian winemaker Randall Grahm and goes undercover as sommelier for a night in a five-star restaurant with a wine list the thickness of a phone book. She looks at the influence of powerful critics, notably Robert Parker and Jancis Robinson, invites readers into her dining room for an informal wine tasting, and compares collecting notes at a bacchanalian dinner with novelist Jay McInerney. As funny and engaging as she is knowledgeable, Natalie has an unconventional wit, curiosity, and obsession with all things related to wine that make for a tour both amusing and informative, from grape to bottle to glass.",

        "Title": "Passion and Principle: John and Jessie Fremont, the Couple Whose Power, Politics, and Love Shaped Nineteenth-Century Americ",
        "Authors": "By Denton, Sally",
        "Description": "John Charles Fremont was the illegitimate child of a Virginia aristocrat and a working class French immigrant; Jessie Benton was the daughter of the most powerful pre-Civil War U.S. senator, Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri. John was twenty-seven when they first met, tanned and handsome, just back from an expedition exploring the American West. Jessie was sixteen, a schoolgirl who had been raised at her father's knee in Washington, D.C., groomed as much as any young man to be president, if not for her gender. From the moment they locked eyes, John and Jessie's lifelong love affair began.The man who unknowingly brought them together, Senator Benton, had been courting Fremont to fulfill the national destiny he envisioned of an expanded United States. But he never imagined his daughter would fall in love with Fremont, who was widely known to be of dubious background and breeding and was certainly not an appropriate mate for Jessie. None of Senator Benton's considerable efforts, however, could keep the young couple apart.Jessie and John made a formidable couple. Both together and apart they contributed significantly to shaping our country: He was a key figure in western expansion, and the first presidential candidate for the Republican Party. She was a savvy political operator who played confidante and adviser to the highest political powers in the country. Despite their great efforts on behalf of their country, their reputations could not survive a Washington smear campaign led by none other than Jessie's father. As a result, John and Jessie were eclipsed and opposed by some of the most mythic characters of their era, not least Abraham Lincoln.As much as Passion and Principle is about the dynamics of this family triangle, it is also about the tumultuous period that forms the backdrop for John and Jessie's lives together, from the abolition of slavery to the building of the railroad. Written with an investigative journalist's eye for detail and a novelist's flair, Passion and Principle restores the reputations of John and Jessie and places them at the center of our country's history.",

        "Description": "In 1836 the United States government received a strange and unprecedented gift--a half-million dollar bequest to establish a foundation in Washington \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.\" The Smithsonian Institution, as it would be called, eventually grew into the largest museum and research complex in the world. Yet the man behind what became \"America's attic,\" James Smithson, has remained a shadowy figure for more than 150 years.Drawing on unpublished diaries and letters from across Europe and the United States, historian Heather Ewing tells his compelling story in full. The illegitimate son of the Duke of Northumberland, Smithson was the youngest member of Britain's Royal Society and a talented chemist admired by the greatest scientists of his age. At the same time, however, he was also a suspected spy, an inveterate gambler, and a radical revolutionary during the turbulent years of the Napoleonic Wars. But at the heart of Smithson's story is his bequest--worth $9 million in today in today's currency--which sparked an international lawsuit and a decade-long congressional battle, featuring a dizzying cast of historical figures, including John Quincy Adams, and Alexander Graham Bell, both of whom grappled with how--and even whether--to put Smithson's endowment to use.Fascinating and magisterial, Ewing's biography presents a sweeping portrait of a remarkable man at the center of the English Enlightenment and the creation of America's greatest museum.",

Often embarrassing and uncomfortable, occasionally outlandish, but most times just a necessary and irresistible evil, the one-night stand is a social rite as old as sex itself and as common as a bar stool.Enter Chelsea Handler. Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. My Horizontal Life chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty. Encouraged by her motley collection of friends (aka: her partners in crime) but challenged by her family members (who at times find themselves a surprise part of the encounter), Chelsea hits bottom and bounces back, unafraid to share the gritty details. My Horizontal Life is one guilty pleasure you won't be ashamed to talk about in the morning.",

        "Authors": "By Orenstein, Peggy",
        "Description": "Waiting for Daisy is about loss, love, anger and redemption. It's about doing all the things you swore you'd never do to get something you hadn't even been sure you wanted. It's about being a woman in a confusing, contradictory time. It's about testing the limits of a loving marriage. And it's about trying (and trying and trying) to have a baby. Orenstein's story begins when she tells her new husband that she's not sure she ever wants to be a mother; it ends six years later after she's done almost everything humanly possible to achieve that goal, from \"fertility sex\" to escalating infertility treatments to New Age remedies to forays into international adoption. Her saga unfolds just as professional women are warned by the media to heed the ticking of their biological clocks, and just as fertility clinics have become a boom industry, with over two million women a year seeking them out.  Buffeted by one jaw-dropping obstacle after another, Orenstein seeks answers both medical and spiritual in America and Asia, along the way visiting an old flame who's now the father of fifteen, and discovering in Japan a ritual of surprising solace. All the while she tries to hold onto a marriage threatened by cycles, appointments, procedures and disappointments. Waiting for Daisy is an honest, wryly funny report from the front, an intimate page-turner that illuminates the ambivalence, obsession, and sacrifice that characterize so many modern women's lives.",

With incisive historical insight and a refreshing sense of humor, David Blatner explores the many facets of pi and humankind's fascination with it\u2013from the ancient Egyptians and Archimedes to Leonardo da Vinci and the modern-day Chudnovsky brothers, who have calculated pi to eight billion digits with a homemade supercomputer.The Joy of Pi is a book of many parts.

Dozens of snippets and factoids reveal pi's remarkable impact over the centuries. Mnemonic devices teach how to memorize pi to many hundreds of digits (or more, if you're so inclined). Pi-inspired cartoons, poems, limericks, and jokes offer delightfully \"square\" pi humor. And, to satisfy even the most exacting of number jocks, the first one million digits of pi appear throughout the book.A tribute to all things pi, The Joy of pi is sure to foster a newfound affection and respect for the big number with the funny little symbol.",

The only constant during this tumultuous time was the power wielded by one person, the resilient, ever-resourceful Tzu Hsi,  Lady Yehonala -- or Empress Orchid, as readers came to know her in Anchee Min\u2019s critically acclaimed novel covering the first part of her life.The Last Empress is the story of Orchid\u2019s dramatic transition from a strong-willed, instinctive young woman to a wise and politically savvy leader who ruled China for more than four decades. Moving from the intimacy of the concubine quarters into the spotlight of the world stage, Orchid must face not only the perilous condition of her empire but also a series of devastating personal losses, as first her son and then her adopted son succumb to early death. Yearning only to step aside, and yet growing constantly into her role, only she\u2014allied with the progressives, but loyal to the conservative Manchu clan of her dynasty\u2014can hold the nation\u2019s rival factions together.Anchee Min offers a powerful revisionist portrait based on extensive research of one of the most important figures in Chinese history. Viciously maligned by the western press of the time as the \u201cDragon Lady,\u201d a manipulative, blood-thirsty woman who held onto power at all costs, the woman Min gives us is a compelling, very human leader who assumed power reluctantly, and who sacrificed all she had to protect those she loved and an empire that was doomed to die.",

        "Description": "From the Pulitzer Prize winner and best-selling author of Woman, a playful, passionate guide to the science all around usWith the singular intelligence and exuberance that made Woman an international sensation, Natalie Angier takes us on a whirligig tour of the scientific canon. She draws on conversations with hundreds of the world's top scientists and on her own work as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer for the New York Times to create a thoroughly entertaining guide to scientific literacy. Angier's gifts are on full display in The Canon, an ebullient celebration of science that stands to become a classic.The Canon is vital reading for anyone who wants to understand the great issues of our time -- from stem cells and bird flu to evolution and global warming. And it's for every parent who has ever panicked when a child asked how the earth was formed or what electricity is. Angier's sparkling prose and memorable metaphors bring the science to life, reigniting our own childhood delight in discovering how the world works. \"Of course you should know about science,\" writes Angier, \"for the same reason Dr. Seuss counsels his readers to sing with a Ying or play Ring the Gack: These things are fun and fun is good.\"The Canon is a joyride through the major scientific disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy. Along the way, we learn what is actually happening when our ice cream melts or our coffee gets cold, what our liver cells do when we eat a caramel, why the horse is an example of evolution at work, and how we're all really made of stardust. It's Lewis Carroll meets Lewis Thomas -- a book that will enrapture, inspire, and enlighten.",

        "Title": "Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War",
        "Authors": "By Fussell, Paul",
        "Description": "Winner of both the National Book Award for Arts and Letters and the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism, Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memory was one of the most original and gripping volumes ever written about the First World War.  Frank Kermode, in The New York Times Book Review, hailed it as \"an important contribution to our understanding of how we came to make World War I part of our minds,\" and Lionel Trilling called it simply \"one of the most deeply moving books I have read in a long time.\"  In its panaramic scope and poetic intensity, it illuminated a war that changed a generation and revolutionized the way we see the world.Now, in Wartime, Fussell turns to the Second World War, the conflict he himself fought in, to weave a narrative that is both more intensely personal and more wide-ranging. Whereas his former book focused primarily on literary figures, on the image of the Great War in literature, here Fussell examines the immediate impact of the war on common soldiers and civilians. He describes the psychological and emotional atmosphere of World War II.  He analyzes the euphemisms people needed to deal with unacceptable reality (the early belief, for instance, that the war could be won by \"precision bombing,\" that is, by long distance); he describes the abnormally intense frustration of desire and some of the means by which desire was satisfied; and, most important, he emphasizes the damage the war did to intellect, discrimination, honesty, individuality, complexity, ambiguity and wit.  Of course, no Fussell book would be complete without some serious discussion of the literature of the time.  He examines, for instance, how the great privations of wartime (when oranges would be raffled off as valued prizes) resulted in roccoco prose styles that dwelt longingly on lavish dinners, and how the \"high-mindedness\" of the era and the almost pathological need to \"accentuate the positive\" led to the downfall of the acerbic H.L. Mencken and the ascent of E.B. White. He also offers astute commentary on Edmund Wilson's argument with Archibald MacLeish, Cyril Connolly's Horizon magazine, the war poetry of Randall Jarrell and Louis Simpson, and many other aspects of the wartime literary world. Fussell conveys the essence of that wartime as no other writer before him.  For the past fifty years, the Allied War has been sanitized and romanticized almost beyond recognition by \"the sentimental, the loony patriotic, the ignorant, and the bloodthirsty.\"  Americans, he says, have never understood what the Second World War was really like. In this stunning volume, he offers such an understanding.",

For ten thousand dollars, he recklessly agreed to help sail a sixty-foot yacht loaded with a ton of hashish from the Virgin Islands to New York City, where he and his partners sold the drug until federal agents caught up with them. For his part in the conspiracy, Gantos was sentenced to serve up to six years in prison.In Hole in My Life, this prizewinning author of over thirty books for young people confronts the period of struggle and confinement that marked the end of his own youth. On the surface, the narrative tumbles from one crazed moment to the next as Gantos pieces together the story of his restless final year of high school, his short-lived career as a criminal, and his time in prison. But running just beneath the action is the story of how Gantos \u2013 once he was locked up in a small, yellow-walled cell \u2013 moved from wanting to be a writer to writing, and how dedicating himself more fully to the thing he most wanted to do helped him endure and ultimately overcome the worst experience of his life.
