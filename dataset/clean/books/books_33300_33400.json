Hired by a formidable matron to investigate the shadowy bona fides of her bubble-headed son's beloved, Archy is wowed by the enigmatic innamorata's purity and pulchritude. But when the artist for whom she posed is killed, McNally's job takes on a decidedly dangerous turn, and he begins to suspect the demure damsel might be both a poser and a poseur.Fighting his way through copious deaths and fiendish scams, Archy pieces together elements of a strange and grisly puzzle, including: a sealed letter containing a horrifying secret; a nude dancer who knows more than she reveals; a missing portrait someone would kill for; and a butterfly tattoo in a very private place, which could be the key to the murder spree.Lawrence Sanders's latest Palm Beach thriller fairly sizzles with greed, glitz, gals, and gore. And it proves, once again, that Archy McNally is, as Cosmopolitan described him, \"as amusing and rich as Dorothy Sayers' great creation, Lord Peter Wimsey.\"",

Those on the home front are no less affected by events: \"I no longer care what Madonna had for breakfast,\" laments Boopsie, proof positive that Everything Has Changed.Half a world away, in Al-Qaeda Qountry, a burka-clad Roland Hedley is captured by a freelance warlord, then wounded by a can of Spam during a massive friendly food drop. Feyzabad Station Chief Havoc's effort to rescue the downed journalist speaks well for the new, improved CIA, which has somehow managed to parlay its \"massive\" intelligence failures into cult status on the nation's campuses. How else to explain Jeff Redfern's new internship with \"Acme Imports\"--and his sudden affinity for shaken-not-stirred libations?Meanwhile, former inside trader Phil Slackmeyer watches from his deathbed as the effort to smoke out evildoers expands to include the entire management team of Enron. Prominent among them is \"Jimmy Jack Jumbo\" Andrews, head of over 400 Caymans-based businesses, who calls his old friend to ask the question on many an ex-exec's mind: \"What's prison like?\" And back at the White House pressroom, NPR attack-dog Mark has questions of his own, like, \"What time will you be launching the cover-up?\" and \"Will there be a lunch?\" Yes, excavating Enron's smoking crater will be a long and dirty job--even if the president barely knows \"Mr. Lay,\" the disgraced CEO with whom he exchanged 350 letters. As Dubya assures us, \"I did not have political relations with that man.\"",

        "Description": "At any given moment, your home probably contains thousands of moveable items, some large but most small: dishes and drain cleaners, blankets and baby books, socks and sleeping bags, hammers and hotdog buns, candles and can-openers and cribbage boards. In a perfect world, most of these items have homes\u2013places where they\u2019re stored outside daily view but where you can find them at a moments notice. In our imperfect world, though, there are probably hundreds of items that are nomads, transients. They have temporary, exposed residences in jumbled drawers, on top of cabinets, across desktops, on window ledges. How often have you looked long and hard for an item in every logical storage place, only to find that it\u2019s been hiding in plain view, in the last place you\u2019d expect? The goal of this book is to help you bring order to this jumble, to tame and civilize the hoards of small and large household items begging for permanent, logical storage. To do this, we\u2019ll give you dozens of easy-to-build storage projects. Each is designed for adaptability and versatility, so you can use it for a variety of different purposes in various rooms. Some projects may require small alterations, but others can be built exactly as directed. Before getting to the projects, we give you a section on planning and assessing, and a section on general building techniques that will be useful in many different projects. After that, it\u2019s off to the storage races, with more than 50 projects, ranging from basic wall cabinets to innovative racks for storing CDs and home electronics. While many projects use standard lumber and other building pipe and electrical conduit. Have fun with these projects. Take the time to plan them out, and take pride in them when you\u2019re finished. Remember: When you increase the efficiency of your storage space, you create a more comfortable living environment for yourself and your family.       Innovative, attractive projects that can provide efficient storage throughout your home     Easy to follow, step-by-step instructions for projects at all skill levels     Shows how to frame, finish and organize a brand-new closet     Variations and ideas sections to help you adapt projects to your needs     Detailed techniques section for working with power and hand tools",

Baghdad lies in ruins.Now the eyes of the world are on Jerusalem as Jon Bennett--a Wall Street strategist turned senior White House advisor--his beautiful CIA partner Erin McCoy and the U.S. Secretary of State arrive in the Middle East to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.On the table: a dramatic and potentially historic Arab-Israeli peace plan, of which Bennett is the chief architect. At the heart of the proposed treaty is the discovery of black gold deep underneath the Mediterranean-a vast and spectacular tract of oil and natural gas that could offer unprecedented riches for every Muslim, Christian, and Jew in Israel and Palestine.With the international media closely tracking the story, the American message is as daring as it is direct: Both sides must put behind them centuries of bitter, violent hostilities to sign a peace treaty. Both sides must truly cooperate on drilling, pumping, refining, and shipping the newly found petroleum. Both sides must work together to develop a dynamic, new, integrated economy to take advantage of the stunning opportunity. Then--and only then--the United States will help underwrite the billions of dollars of venture capital needed to turn the dream into reality.But in the shadows lie men whose hearts are filled with evil--men who do not relish a post-Saddam era, men for whom the prospect of a Palestinian peace accord with Israel goes against everything for which their fathers have fought and died. Such men--and the countries that finance them--are ready to do anything necessary to slaughter those who stand in their way. The clock is ticking. Can Bennett, McCoy, and the American President make peace before the Middle East once again erupts in war?",

For the loss of 11 aircraft, the Mohne and Eder dams in Germany's industrial heartland were breached, and a famous if controversial victory won. John Sweetman's book is the most comprehensive account of this legendary mission, from the development of Barnes Wallis' 'bouncing bomb' (in reality a revolving depth-charge) to every moment of the raid itself, under the charismatic command of Guy Gibson, VC.",

        "Description": "Dean Koontz has been called \"America's most popular suspense novelist,\"* but that only begins to describe the rich variety and endless invention that characterize his work. Critics hail his impeccable craft and the artistry that has inspired the devotion of millions of fans around the world. He is unique among contemporary writers, venturing far beyond traditional boundaries to explore our deepest fears and most transcendent aspirations. Now, in From the Corner of His Eye, Koontz brings together his most powerful themes to draw readers into a spellbinding world made by a master at the top of his form -- a story rich in triumph and tragedy, joy and terror, love, hate, and profound meaning, played out by perhaps the most unforgettable cast of characters he has yet created.Bartholomew Lampion is born in Bright Beach, California, on a day of tragedy and terror, when the lives of everyone in his family are changed forever. Remarkable events accompany his birth, and everyone agrees that his unusual eyes are the most beautiful they have ever seen. On this same day, a thousand miles away, a ruthless man learns that he has a mortal enemy named Bartholomew. He doesn't know who Bartholomew is, but he embarks on a search that will become the purpose of his life. If ever he finds the right Bartholomew, he will deal mercilessly with him.And in San Francisco, a girl is born, the result of a violent rape. Her survival is miraculous, and her destiny is mysteriously linked to the fates of Barty and the man who stalks him.At the age of three, Barty Lampion is blinded when surgeons reluctantly remove his eyes to save him from a fast-spreading cancer.  As the growing boy copes with his blindness and proves to be a prodigy, his mother, an exceptional woman, counsels him that all things happen for a reason, that there is meaning even in his suffering, and that he will affect the lives of people yet unknown to him in ways startling and profound.At thirteen, Bartholomew regains his sight. How he regains it, why he regains it, and what happens as his amazing life unfolds results in a breathtaking journey of courage, heart-stopping suspense, and high adventure. His mother once told him that every person's life has an effect on every other person's, in often unknowable ways, and Barty's eventful life indeed entwines with others in ways that will astonish and move everyone who reads his story. People magazine has said that Dean Koontz has the \"power to scare the daylights out of us.\" In this, perhaps the most thrilling, suspenseful, and emotionally powerful work of his critically acclaimed career, Koontz does that and far more. He has created a compulsive page-turner that will have you at the edge of your seat, a narrative tour de force that will change the way you yourself look at the world.",

Abigail Mather is a woman of enormous appetites, sexual and otherwise. Her fraternal twin Dorcas couldn't be more different: she gave up on sex without once trying it, and she lives a controlled, dignified life of the mind. Though Abigail exasperates Dorcas, the two love each other; in fact, they complete each other. They are an odd pair, set down in an odd Rhode Island town, where everyone has a story to tell, and writers, both published and unpublished, carom off each other like billiard balls. What is it that makes the two women targets for the new man in town, the charming schlockmeister Conrad Lowe, tall, whippet-thin and predatory? In Abigail and Dorcas he sees a new and tantalizing challenge. Not the mere conquest of Abigail, with her easy reputation, but a longer and more sinister game. A game that will lead to betrayal, shame and, ultimately, murder.In her darkly comic and unsettling first novel, Jincy Willett proves that she is a true find: that rare writer who can explore the shadowy side of human nature with the lightest of touches.",

From that first sentence, Dragon Tears explodes across the page with the excitement, chilling suspense, emotion, and deeply drawn characters that have earned Dean Koontz enormous worldwide popularity.Police detective Harry Lyon is a perfectionist who likes his condo immaculate, his suits well tailored, and his homicide files typed error-free. To Harry's dismay, his partner, Connie Gulliver, embraces chaos, urging him to \"get in touch with the rhythms of destruction.\" But when Harry and Connie have to kill in the line of duty, the ensuing surreal nightmare makes Connie's cynical world view seem all too accurate.That same afternoon, a hulking street person prophesies that Harry will be dead by dawn, then self-destructs before his eyes. As twilight falls, Harry glimpses strange creatures in the shadows, and finds his rational world transformed into a place of bizarre surprises and unimaginable dangers. As dawn ticks closer, Harry is caught in a whirlwind of terror that threatens to sweep away not only him but Connie and everyone he loves. The San Diego Union has called Dean Koontz \"a master storyteller... sometimes humorous, sometimes shocking, but always riveting.\" Never before has that judgment been truer than in the vastly entertaining, enormously satisfying Dragon Tears.",

        "Description": "Fifty years ago, as Europe's colonial powers withdrew, Africa moved with enormous hope and fervor toward democracy and economic independence. Dozens of new states were launched amid much jubilation and the world's applause. African leaders, popularly elected, stepped forward to tackle the problems of development and nation-building. In the Cold War era, the new states excited the attention of the superpowers. Africa was considered too valuable a prize to lose.  Today, Africa is a continent rife with disease, death, and devastation. Most African countries are effectively bankrupt, prone to civil strife, subject to dictatorial rule, and dependent on Western assistance for survival. The  sum of Africa's misfortunes ? its wars, its despotisms, its corruption, its droughts ? is truly daunting.  What went wrong? What happened to this vast  continent, so rich in resources, culture and history, to bring it so close to destitution and despair in the space of two generations?  Focusing on the key personalities, events and themes of the independence era, Martin Meredith's riveting narrative history seeks to explore and explain the myriad problems that Africa has faced in the past half-century, and faces still. From the giddy enthusiasm of the 1960s to the \"coming of tyrants\" and rapid decline, The Fate of Africa is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand how it came to this ? and what, if anything, is to be done.",

        "Description": "Everybody around lawyer Mary DiNunzio has decided she isn't allowed to be a Young Widow anymore, even though she didn't know there was an official cutoff. They're all trying to fix her up -- her South Philly Italian parents, her best friend Judy Carrier, even the office security guard.     All Mary wants to do is immerse herself in a case  everybody else calls \"The History Channel\", a pro bono representation of the Brandolini estate. The roots of the matter sink deep into the past, when Amadeo Brandolini emigrated to Philadelphia, started a family, and built up a small fishing business. At the outbreak of World War II, Brandolini was arrested by the FBI as part of a mass internment of Italian-Americans and was sent to a camp in Montana, where he eventually committed suicide. Now, more than sixty years later, his son's estate hires Mary to sue for reparations.    Mary vows to vindicate Amadeo even though it won't be easy. With only a lock of hair, an old wallet, and a sheet of paper filled with odd doodles to go on, the tenacious lawyer begins to research the case but finds instead puzzling new questions. Someone doesn't want Mary to find the truth, and before long, her life is threatened. Suddenly, the quiet, squeaky-clean good girl who never left Mercer Street is risking life and limb to finger a killer and lay a beloved ghost to rest.     New York Times bestselling author Lisa Scottoline delivers a stunning new tale filled with witty dialogue, vibrant characters, and breakneck pacing, in which true-life history reinforces her hallmark themes of justice and family. As entertaining as it is poignant, Killer Smile is a surefire bestseller from a writer at the peak of her talents.",
