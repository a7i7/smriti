        "Description": "The \"emerging church\" movement is perhaps the most significant church trend of our day. The emerging church offers and encourages a new way of doing and being the church. While it largely resonates with an eighteen-to-thirty-four-year-old audience--the first fully postmodern generation--it is also gaining popularity with older Christians and encompasses a broad array of traditional and contemporary churches. Emerging Churches explores this movement and provides insight into its success.Filled with the latest research and interesting, anecdotal testimonies from those on the cutting edge of ministry, this book provides pastors, church leaders, and interested readers with an insightful glimpse into the thriving churches of today--and tomorrow.",

Shane gets there; Alexa doesn't.   This tale turns deadly, when in the middle of the night, he's called to a crime scene on Mulholland Drive, where the victim, who appears to be a gang member has been handcuffed and executed, gangland style.  What's worse is that the victim's body is in Alexa's car.  Her service revolver, which Shane discovers nearby, is probably the murder weapon.  But Alexa is missing. As Shane desperately tries to find his wife, his leads take him into the frightening world of gangsta rap music and into the center of a feud between two record companies, both heavily manned by Crips and Bloods.  At the center of this war is one of the most lethal adversaries he's ever encountered: Stacy Maluga, a trashy, beautiful Lady Macbeth-like white woman raised in Compton, married to a multi-millionaire rap mogul and known in the gangsta hip-hop world as the White Sister. Shane is no stranger to big trouble, but he's never had to face being a cop in jail with a hit out on him, while being smeared by urban activists as a \"racist cop.\"  Much, much worse than all that is the potential death of his beloved wife, Alexa.  In the White Sister, he may have met his match in a powerful and media-savvy enemy who will stop at nothing to forge her own criminal empire.",

        "Description": "A captivating biography of the legendary ball player Lou Gehrig, known for both his prowess on the field and his courage in life.Lou Gehrig will go down in history as one of the best ballplayers of all time. With a career average of .340 and 493 home runs, he played in a record-setting 2,130 consecutive games and  was elected to the Hall of Fame. He was robbed of his superb physical skills as a relatively young man by ALS, the degenerative disease now known as \"Lou Gehrig's Disease\", and died in 1941. Ray Robinson re-creates the life of this legendary ballplayer and also provides an insightful look at baseball through the Depression years, including all the great players of that era -- Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Miller Huggins, and more.",

This is a book one never forgets: Tom whitewashing Aunt Polly\u2019s fence, Tom and Huck\u2019s dreadful oath, their cure for warts (\"spunk water\" and dead cats), Tom\u2019s puppy love for Becky Thatcher, the boys playing \"pirate\" on Jackson\u2019s Island.This Mark Twain Library text is the only edition since the first (1876) to be based directly on the author\u2019s manuscript and to include all of the \"200 rattling pictures\" Mark Twain commissioned from one of his favorite illustrators, True W. Williams.",

Musical and supple, with rewards for the eye, the ear, and the mind, concerned as much with country as with city matters, Davison's poems move past personality. They open questions of identity, explorations of the natural world, personal and religious conflict, and the mysterious workings of memory. His poetry, such as the long poem \"The Great Ledge,\" is especially moving and powerful when read aloud.This volume, combining Davison's most recent work with all the earlier poems he wishes to preserve, reveals a poet in his late middle age writing out of the midst of a life both active and contemplative, yet given over to poetry. He is a worthy heir to the passionate poetic tradition of Thomas Hardy and Robert Frost.",

When are aggressive clandestine operations justifiable, and who should be responsible for deciding to proceed with them? Should the United States engage in more aggressive economic espionage? These are just a few of the issues Loch Johnson examines in this thoughtful assessment of strategic intelligence and its vital role in modern governments.Johnson draws on historical data, more than five hundred interviews, and his own experience working for Congressional committees on intelligence. He begins by defining the functions of intelligence: espionage, counterintelligence, and covert action. He then provides an overview of America\u2019s secret operations abroad, assesses the moral implications of clandestine operations, and offers guidelines for a more ethical approach to the use of secret power. Johnson explores the question of intelligence accountability, looking closely at how well intelligence agencies have been monitored through the forum of Congressional hearings. He compares America\u2019s approach to intelligence with that of other nations, discusses the degree to which intelligence agencies should provide information about foreign businesses, and evaluates how well the U.S. intelligence agencies fared during the Cold War against the USSR. Secret agencies have the capacity not only to safeguard democracy but also to subvert it, says Johnson. As such, they deserve both our support and our scrutiny.",

        "Description": "The crisis in university education has been the subject of vigorous debate in recent years. In this eloquent and deeply personal book, a distinguished scholar reflects on the character and aims of the university, assessing its guiding principles, its practical functions, and its role in society.Jaroslav Pelikan provides a unique perspective on the university today by reexamining it in light of John Henry Cardinal Newman's 150-year-old classic The Idea of a University and showing how Cardinal Newman's ideas both illuminate and differ from current problems facing higher education. Pelikan begins by affirming the validity of Newman's first principle: that knowledge must be an end in itself. He goes on to make the case for the inseparability of research and teaching on both intellectual and practical grounds, stressing the virtues--free inquiry, scholarly honesty, civility in discourse, toleration of diverse beliefs and values, and trust in rationality and public verifiability--that must be practiced and taught by the university. He discusses the business of the university--the advancement of knowledge through research, the extension and interpretation of knowledge through undergraduate and graduate teaching, the preservation of knowledge in libraries, museums, and galleries, and the diffusion of knowledge through scholarly publishing. And he argues that by performing these tasks, by developing closer ties with other schools at all levels, and by involving the community in lifelong education, the university will make its greatest contribution to society.",

Are leaders' role being usurped by a media whose technology can communicate faster and more emotionally to an unsuspecting public? Johanna Neuman debunks the common wisdom that we are experiencing a revolution in communication technology's influence over political decisions. What she unearths instead is an unrelenting pattern of change whenever new media inventions intersect with the political world, from movable type to the Internet.With a journalist's eye for detail, Neuman documents that each age thinks the technology that blesses its generation is revolutionary and unprecedented. Whenever a new media technology arrives, diplomats complain that their deliberation time is hastened, journalists boast that their influence is increased, and social commentators marvel that new technology will democratize all within its range. Just as predictable is the second pattern: Each generation eventually absorbs the changes demanded by technology and finds other ways of doing business. New technology may shorten the time it takes the public to receive information, but in the end, political leadership trumps media power.",

Do you ever look at how the Christian faith is being lived out in the new millennium and wonder if we\u2019re not doing what we\u2019re supposed to be doing? That we still haven\u2019t quite \u201cgotten it\u201d? That we\u2019ve missed the point regarding many important issues? It\u2019s understandable if we\u2019ve relied on what we\u2019ve been told to believe or what\u2019s widely accepted by the Christian community. But if we truly turned a constructive, critical eye toward our beliefs and vigorously questioned them and their origins, where would we find ourselves? Best-selling authors Brian McLaren and Tony Campolo invite you to do just that. Join them on an adventure\u2014one that\u2019s about uncovering and naming faulty conclusions, suppositions, and assumptions about the Christian faith. In Adventures in Missing the Point, the authors take turns addressing how we\u2019ve missed the point on crucial topics such as: salvation, the Bible, being postmodern, worship, homosexuality, truth, and many more.",

The good news is that only one of them can swim anyway. Bestselling author Chris Crutcher\u2019s controversial and acclaimed novel follows a group of outcasts as they take on inequality and injustice in their high school. \"Crutcher's superior gifts as a storyteller and his background as a working therapist combine to make magic in Whale Talk. The thread of truth in his fiction reminds us that heroes can come in any shape, color, ability or size, and friendship can bridge nearly any divide.\u201d\u2014Washington PostT.J. Jones hates the blatant preferential treatment jocks receive at his high school, and the reverence paid to the varsity lettermen. When he sees a member of the wrestling team threatening an underclassman, T.J. decides he\u2019s had enough. He recruits some of the biggest misfits at Cutter High to form a swim team. They may not have very much talent, but the All-Night Mermen prove to be way more than T.J. anticipated. As the unlikely athletes move closer to their goal, these new friends might learn that the journey is worth more than the reward. For fans of Andrew Smith and Marieke Nijkamp. \"Crutcher offers an unusual yet resonant mixture of black comedy and tragedy that lays bare the superficiality of the high-school scene. The book's shocking climax will force readers to re-examine their own values and may cause them to alter their perception of individuals pegged as 'losers.'\"\u2014Publishers WeeklyAn American Library Association Best Book for Young AdultsNew York Public Library Books for the Teen Age",

SurfRiders puts readers in the curl with 100 vivid full-color photographs and more than 20 stories by the greatest names in surfing. Chasing the swells from Waimea Bay to South Africa&#39;s Cape St. Francis, it brings to life the near-mystical allure of riding the big wave, the rush of shooting the tube, the draw of the pipeline. Along the way, it shows readers the pivotal points of surfing&#39;s development, explores the unique beach boy culture its spawned, provides a fascinating look at the evolution of the surfboard (or \"gun\" as its called) and recounts some of the most outrageous sets ever ridden.   In the tradition of Ski Fever! and The Olympic Spirit, this visually stunning book also features tons of sidebars, historic photos and incredible images of today&#39;s greatest champions. Designed for both die-hard surfers and landlocked dreamers alike, it is as close to hanging ten in big wave heaven as you can get without getting wet.",

Her strip is poignant and funny--and very often, universal. She captures a mother's frustration at an unruly teenager, a father's surprise in a growing daughter, and kids' various views about their future as they grow up.In It's the Thought That Counts, For Better or For Worse looks back on many of the series' high points through Lynn's hand-picked selection of color Sundays: the unexpected birth of baby April in 1991; the daring revelation that teenage family friend Lawrence was gay; the fear that comes with aging parents. The collection also includes those quietly funny moments in families: a father and his kids romping with abandon; a closet full of clothes that no longer span a middle-aged girth; a teenage son's first experience with a crush.Lynn Johnston fashioned the Patterson family after her own lively brood. Her real life experiences--divorce, childbirth, pets, and parents--show through in her work in the most wise and wonderful ways. Even better, this anniversary book contains Johnston's comments about some of her favorite strips in an amusing and informative narrative.",
