        "Description": "In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military  history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the  legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Here is the true story behind  the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will  of America. In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima\u2014and  into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches  strewn with comrades, they battled to the island's highest peak. And after climbing  through a landscape of hell itself, they raised a flag. Now the son of one of the  flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came  together in a moment that will live forever. To his family, John Bradley never spoke  of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy, his family discovered  closed boxes of letters and photos. In Flags of Our Fathers, James Bradley draws  on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company.  Following these men's paths to Iwo Jima, James Bradley has written a classic story  of the heroic battle for the Pacific's most crucial island\u2014an island riddled with  Japanese tunnels and 22,000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man. But  perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory.  The men in the photo\u2014three were killed during the battle\u2014were proclaimed heroes and  flown home, to become reluctant symbols. For two of them, the adulation was shattering.  Only James Bradley's father truly survived, displaying no copy of the famous photograph  in his home, telling his son only: \"The real heroes of Iwo Jima were the guys who  didn't come back.\" Few books ever have captured the complexity and furor of war  and its aftermath as well as Flags of Our Fathers. A penetrating, epic look at a  generation at war, this is history told with keen insight, enormous honesty, and  the passion of a son paying homage to his father. It is the story of the difference  between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human  experience of war.",

And it gives you a list of the most suitable herbs for each habitat.The chapter devoted to designing your garden with herbs is an invaluable source of ideas and suggestions for creating different types of beds, including a water garden, a wildflower garden, a kitchen garden, and a formal herb garden. Garden features such as lawns, paths, and walls can also be planted with herbs. Indeed, even the smallest gardens can benefit from herbs that are suited to patios and containers.In addition, a fully illustrated directory lists more than 180 of the most decorative and interesting herbs and gives complete cultivation information.",

Without strong, moral leadership, without a renewed sense of purpose, without a rededication to family and community, without shunning the race hustlers and pop-culture sham artists, without protecting our borders, language, and culture, the nation that once was the land of the free and home of the brave\"\" and the \"\"one last hope of mankind\"\" will repeat the catastrophic mistakes of the past. \"\"In Mortal Danger\"\" is his prescription for repairing the damage.\"\"",

        "Title": "My Brother, My Enemy: America and the Battle of Ideas Across the Islamic World",
        "Authors": "By Smucker, Philip",
        "Description": "This kaleidoscopic tour behind the frontlines of the war of ideas assesses US efforts to persuade Muslims that Americans respect their rights and interests, while we fight wars and promote our interests. The author draws on his extensive travels in the Muslim world and interviews with a cross-section of the population including students, intellectuals, insurgents and politicians. For an American perspective, the author conducted candid interviews with US military officers, diplomats, and regional experts. Smucker describes turmoil within the Islamic realm and our efforts to project \"soft power\" into a world that remains misunderstood. He assesses both our failures and successes in Israel and Palestine, Egypt, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Saharan Africa. Several themes resonate through these interviews. One is that the Muslim world is looking for consistent engagement from the US, particularly in regard to Israeli-Palestinian peace. After decades of paying lip service to the ideal of peace in the Middle East, the author shows why it is crucial for the Obama Administration to push forcefully for a two-state solution. Another is that the US must discontinue its policy of backing authoritarian regimes that oppress their people. In the eyes of everyday Muslims, such tactics make a mockery of our claim to be the champion of individual liberty. Muslims, many of whom already support democratic change, will only be convinced of America\u2019s good will, says the author if our actions speak louder than our words.\u00a0This revealing, vividly told narrative by a daring and experienced journalist with firsthand knowledge of the events and people in conflict areas offers unforgettable insights into the Muslim world\u2019s hopes and fears as well as our own crucial diplomatic overtures and military campaigns across the Islamic world.",

Khrushchev told jokes, threw tantrums, sparked a riot in a San Francisco supermarket, wowed the coeds in a home economics class in Iowa, and ogled Shirley MacLaine as she filmed a dance scene in Can-Can. He befriended and offended a cast of characters including Nelson Rockefeller, Richard Nixon, Eleanor Roosevelt, Elizabeth Taylor, and Marilyn Monroe.Published for the fiftieth anniversary of the trip, K Blows Top is a work of history that reads like a Vonnegut novel. This cantankerous communist\u2019s road trip took place against the backdrop of the fifties in capitalist America, with the shadow of the hydrogen bomb hanging over his visit like the Sword of Damocles. As Khrushchev kept reminding people, he was a hot-tempered man who possessed the power to incinerate America.",

        "Description": "Already hailed as \"brave, emotional, and gorgeously written\" by Frances Mayes and \"like a piece of dark chocolate--bittersweet, satisfying, and finished all too soon\" by Laura Fraser, author of An Italian Affair, this is a unique memoir about the search for identity through love, hunger, and food.Jim Harrison says, \"TRAIL OF CRUMBS reminds me of what heavily costumed and concealed waifs we all are.  Kim Sun\u00e9e tells us so much about the French that I never learned in 25 trips to Paris, but mostly about the terrors and pleasure of that infinite octopus, love.  A fine book.\"When Kim Sun\u00e9e was three years old, her mother took her to a marketplace, deposited her on a bench with a fistful of food, and promised she'd be right back. Three days later a policeman took the little girl, clutching what was now only a fistful of crumbs, to a police station and told her that she'd been abandoned by her mother.Fast-forward almost 20 years and Kim's life is unrecognizable. Adopted by a young New Orleans couple, she spends her youth as one of only two Asian children in her entire community. At the age of 21, she becomes involved with a famous French businessman and suddenly finds herself living in France, mistress over his houses in Provence and Paris, and stepmother to his eight year-old daughter.Kim takes readers on a lyrical journey from Korea to New Orleans to Paris and Provence, along the way serving forth her favorite recipes. A love story at heart, this memoir is about the search for identity and a book that will appeal to anyone who is passionate about love, food, travel, and the ultimate search for self.",

        "Authors": "By Carpenter, Ted Galen",
        "Description": "The domestic phase of Washington's war on drugs has received considerable criticism over the years from a variety of individuals. Until recently, however, most critics have not stressed the damage that the international phase of the drug war has done to our Latin American neighbors. That lack of attention has begun to change and Ted Carpenter chronicles our disenchantment with the hemispheric drug war. Some prominent Latin American political leaders have finally dared to criticize Washington while at the same time, the U.S. government seems determined to perpetuate, if not intensify, the antidrug crusade. Spending on federal antidrug measures also continues to increase, and the tactics employed by drug war bureaucracy, both here and abroad, bring the inflammatory \"drug war\" metaphor closer to reality. Ending the prohibitionist system would produce numerous benefits for both Latin American societies and the United States. In a book deriving from his work at the CATO Institute, Ted Carpenter paints a picture of this ongoing fiasco.",

        "Description": "The story of pasta is inextricably linked to the aristocratic tradition of cucina alto borghese, or sophisticated cooking, from Renaissance Tuscany, which Lorenza has long championed. Pasta is never an ordinary dish: even when simply dressed with garlic, oil, and Parmesan cheese, it should be prepared and cooked with care and attention. Within 200 enticing recipes, Lorenza sets out the principles of selecting just the right sauce or stuffing and also provides invaluable suggestions for coordinating pasta with other dishes on the menu. Lorenza's dishes offer inspiration for every level of entertaining, whether it's a spontaneous family lunch or an elegant dinner party with friends.From classics like Ravioli with Bacon and Potatoes and Trenette with Pesto Sauce to the more sophisticated and unusual - Agnolotti with Black Truffles, Penne with Swordfish, Zitoni with Olives, Saffron, and Sardines - the recipes are defined clearly for all aspiring cooks. There are delicious molded and baked pasta dishes - Fettucine Crust with Pecorino and Mint, Macaroni Timbale with Mushrooms - or pasta in broths and soups - Angel Hair and Asparagus Soup and Quadrucci Soup - as well as stuffed pasta dishes - Green Cannelloni with Mushrooms, Ravioli with Scallops, Tortelloni Stuffed with Zucchini and Tarragon. All reveal Lorenza's particular passions and flair for simple but elegant cooking. Arranged according to sauces - seafood, meat, vegetable, and cheese - each appetizing course conjures a world of Italian flavors and aromas.",

        "Description": "This award-winning book, substantially updated to reflect the latest developments in the field, introduces the concepts and best practices of software architecture--how a software system is structured and how that system's elements are meant to interact. Distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems, and is crucial to a software organization's business strategy.  Drawing on their own extensive experience, the authors cover the essential technical topics for designing, specifying, and validating a system. They also emphasize the importance of the business context in which large systems are designed. Their aim is to present software architecture in a real-world setting, reflecting both the opportunities and constraints that companies encounter. To that end, case studies that describe successful architectures illustrate key points of both technical and organizational discussions.  Topics new to this edition include:    Architecture design and analysis, including the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)  Capturing quality requirements and achieving them through quality scenarios and tactics  Using architecture reconstruction to recover undocumented architectures  Documenting architectures using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) New case studies, including Web-based examples and a wireless Enterprise JavaBeans&#153 (EJB) system designed to support wearable computers The financial aspects of architectures, including use of the Cost Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM) to make decisions    If you design, develop, or manage the building of large software systems (or plan to do so), or if you are interested in acquiring such systems for your corporation or government agency, use  Software Architecture in Practice, Second Edition,  to get up to speed on the current state of software architecture.",

        "Description": "It began when she was a teenager with an awareness of her body and the reaction other people had to it. It continued with the realization that women's bodies often gave them a strange power over men. As an adult, it became a fascination with professional sex workers, leading to a plunge into their world. And when Elisabeth Eaves left the world of peep shows and private dancers for the more socially acceptable career of international journalism, she found she could not put that fascination behind her. Her experiences had left her with too many questions and too few answers. So she returned to the world she had left behind. Now, in this candid and insightful book, she recounts her firsthand experience of stripping and gives us a new understanding of women's sexuality and contemporary sexual mores.Bare follows the author and her fellow dancers through Seattle strip clubs and bachelor parties, exploring in riveting detail Eaves's own motivations and behavior, as well as those of her coworkers, as they make their way through the sometimes exhilarating, often disturbing world of stripping. Grounded in an understanding of the intricate dynamics of exchanging sexual services for money, Eaves's narrative examines the ways in which the work affects the women; how they negotiate the slippery boundaries between their jobs and their \"real\" lives; how their personal relationships are altered; how they reconcile themselves - or don't - to the stereotypes that surround their profession; whether the work is exploitative or empowering or both.",

Both the twelve-year-old and his father become fugitives, pursued by the constable. Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them. In a story spanning five decades, Last Night in Twisted River - John Irving's twelfth novel - depicts the recent half-century in the United States as a world \"where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course.\" From the novel's taut opening sentence - \"The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long.\" - to its elegiac final chapter, what distinguishes Last Night in Twisted River is the author's unmistakable voice, the inimitable voice of an accomplished storyteller.",

        "Description": "It turns out that the warm, let's-all-get-along connotations of inclusion are misleading. Achieving true inclusion is hard. Very hard. Harder than achieving awareness. Harder than achieving tolerance and sensitivity. Harder than diversity itself. In The Inclusion Paradox: The Obama Era and the Transformation of Global Diversity Andr\u00e9s Tapia, Hewitt Associates' Chief Diversity Officer, reveals how in these times of unprecedented peril and opportunity, diversity's demographic tsunami is accelerating today's social, economic, and political tectonic shifts. In the book, he explores what is required to move into the next generation of diversity work in ways that get past the tired and clich\u00e9d approaches. He makes the case for making inclusion relevant for all, including the white male, and breaks ground by challenging the notion that the melting pot leads to inclusion. On the contrary, Tapia makes the case that \"equality\" often does not equal \"same.\" The Inclusion Paradox also focuses on the cultural implications of the Obama Era in the United States and around the world. More than a political point in time, the Obama Era is a cultural marker that succinctly captures the various global trends converging at this time in history. The Inclusion Paradox will enable readers to contribute strategically and practically to the urgent work of making diversity and inclusion relevant to business and organizational success around the world.",
