        "Description": "A Brookings Institution Press and the Egyptian Center for Economic Studies (ECES) publicationImproving the economic performance of Arab countries is now more critical than ever. The region faces high population growth rates, rising unemployment, and modest economic growth coupled with increasingly intense competition from emerging markets in eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Meeting these challenges requires finding ways to overcome political obstacles that impede socially beneficial economic reforms. Despite fifty years of repeated attempts at Arab economic integration, the results in terms of intraregional trade and investment flows have been very modest. This book explains why and discusses possible ways forward. The authors draw especially on the success of the European Union to assess the scope of Arab economic integration as an instrument for narrowing the persistent gap between the region\u00a1\u00afs economic potential and its performance.",

He draws upon extensive research and nearly two hundred interviews with childhood neighbors, fellow workers, old loves, airmen who flew with Stewart during World War II, as well as with close and estranged family members and friends.This riveting biography follows Stewart from his hometown of Indiana, Pennsylvania, and a childhood shaped by a strong-willed father, to the fateful encounter at Princeton University with actress Margaret Sullavan, to his first professional theatrical experiences on Cape Cod, and the forging of a remarkable life-long friendship with Henry Fonda in New York, to his unexpected stardom at MGM.During WWII, Stewart rushed to enlist in the Army Air Corps, and details of his heroic military record are disclosed here for the first time.Dewey explores the craft behind a trademark Stewart performance, and discusses in detail each of the more than seventy-five movies in Stewart's filmography.",

        "Title": "The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies",
        "Authors": "By Harvey, Greg and Siewers, Alfred (FRW)",
        "Description": "J.R.R. Tolkien's novels of Middle-earth\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and The Silmarillian\u00a0\u2013\u00a0have become some of the most famous, and most beloved, literary works of the twentieth century. And the Lord of the Rings films by director Peter Jackson have re-ignited interest in Tolkien and his works, as well as introduced his stories to a new generation of fans.  Even if you've never read the novels and have only seen the films, you know that the world of Middle-earth is a complicated one. Tolkien took great care in representing this world, from creating new languages to including very particular cultural details that add to the richness of the world's fabric. Many other books have been written about Tolkien and his works, but none have come close to providing the kind of reference needed to comprehend the world of Middle-earth. That's what veteran Dummies author and unabashed Tolkien fan Greg Harvey attempts to do in The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies. As the author says in his introduction to the book, this is not an encyclopedia or quick guide to all the diverse beings, languages, and history that make up Tolkien's Middle-earth. Nor is it a set of plot outlines for the novels. Rather, what you'll find in The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies is a basic guide to some of the possible linguistic and mythological origins of Middle-earth, plus a rudimentary analysis of its many themes and lessons for our world. This book can help enrich your reading (or re-reading) of Tolkien's novels, and it will challenge you to think about the themes inherent in Tolkien's Middle-earth and their implications in your own life. Here's just a sampling of the topics you'll find covered in The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies:  Exploring the main themes in Tolkien's works, including immortality and death; the heroic quest; love; fate and free will; and faith and redemption Investigating the diverse lands of Middle-earth\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including the Shire, Gondor, and Mordor\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and their significance Examining the different cultures of Middle-earth, such as Hobbits, Elves, Men, and those wily Wizards Touring the history of Middle-earth Understanding Tolkien's creation of new languages to enrich the story of Middle-earth Top Ten lists on the battles in the War of the Ring, online resources, and the ways the films differ from the novels  So, whether you're reading Tolkien's novels or watching the films for the first time, or you've been a fan for many years and are looking for a new take on Tolkien's works, The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth For Dummies can help you enhance your reading or viewing experience for years to come.",

On the way John Moschos and his pupil Sophronius the Sophist stayed in caves, monasteries, and remote hermitages, collecting the wisdom of the stylites and the desert fathers before their fragile world finally shattered under the great eruption of Islam. More than a thousand years later, using Moschos's writings as his guide, William Dalrymple sets off to retrace their footsteps and composes \"an evensong for a dying civilization\" --Kirkus Reviews, starred review",

It was also the most luxurious, boasting many features unheard of in oceangoing liners. It was considered \"unsinkable.\" On the morning of Wednesday, April 10, 1912, the pride of the White Star Line slowly began its journey into infamy. On the evening of Monday the 15th, strange, unbelievable rumors began their spread, chiefly around Belfast, Liverpool, Southampton, and London, cities having links to the new, great, and powerful Atlantic liner. How could anything have gone wrong? Surely it was impossible.The newspaper headlines the following morning were to shake the whole of Britain, and indeed the world, with the news that tragedy had befallen the Titanic. With many, often conflicting, reports over the next months, the full story of the disaster slowly unfolded in subsequent editions of the press. The dramatic reports from the British press are presented here in full: accounts from the first headlines to the end of the first inquiry, followed by eager readers around the world. These stories and photographs combine in a book that will appeal to general readers and Titanic followers alike.",

        "Description": "Winner of the CWA Gold Dagger AwardInspector Erlendur returns in this gripping Icelandic thriller When a skeleton is discovered half-buried in a construction site outside of Reykjav\u00edk, Inspector Erlendur finds himself knee-deep in both a crime scene and an archeological dig. Bone by bone, the body is unearthed, and the brutalizing history of a family who lived near the building site comes to light along with it. Was the skeleton a man or a woman, a victim or a killer, and is this a simple case of murder or a long-concealed act of justice? As Erlendur tries to crack this cold case, he must also save his drug-addicted daughter from self destruction and somehow glue his hopelessly fractured family back together.Like the chilly Nordic mysteries of Henning Mankell and Karen Fossum, Arnaldur Indridason delivers a stark police procedural full of humanity and pathos, a classic noir from a very cold place.",
