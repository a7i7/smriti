They will see how worship can lift them higher for a God's eye view of things as they seek the face of God, and then they can begin to see the trouble they face from God's perspective instead of being trapped in an earthly, time-bound viewpoint. The higher we go, the smaller our problems seem. Each chapter ofGod's Eye View Workbook is designed to provoke thought and encourage personal application of the Bible truths and principles contained inGod's Eye View. Tenney writes, \"Remember that God's Eye View Workbook is a tool to help you draw closer to God and grow deeper in your Christian faith. It is not a race, so your goal should not be to 'rush to the finish line first.' Spread your wings in praise and worship and 'mount up with wings like an eagle.'\"",

Henry joyfully sees a chance to lead a dual life as Bible salesman and a G-man.During his hilarious and scary adventures we learn of Henry's fundamentalist youth, an upbringing that doesn't prepare him for his new life. As he falls in love and questions his religious training, Henry begins to see he's being used--that the fun and games are over, that he is on his own in a way he never imagined.",

While working in these breathtaking locations, he began to make a wish list of what would go into his ideal garden. But when he tried to re-create these elements on his own modest property in northern Vermont, the plants didn't survive and the design looked out of place. From this experience, Brown learned to take the principles he learned from gifted gardeners and adapt them to what he could really achieve - to let the land and his own lifestyle guide the development of his garden and not to impose an ideal derived from someone else's. The result is a book that both delights and inspires through its glorious garden photography and shows in a practical way what you can do to make your own beautiful personal garden.",

Not long after, Harry witnesses a different murder: a crime of passion committed by a cabinet minister. Harry must help clean up the crime scene, turn the dead woman into a Missing Person, and ensure the guilty man does not become a suspect.  In The Crooked Man, Philip Davison offers fans of contemporary Irish literature something wonderfully unexpected-a wry, grim thriller with a dark sense of humor, of depravity, and of humanity.  \"Harry Fielding, the narrator, is a gem. World-weary and clueless, knowing and blind, he's the perfect escort through this memorable and very accomplished book.\" (Roddy Doyle, author of A Star Called Henry)",

In this brutal workplace, female miners were relentlessly   threatened with pornographic graffiti, denigrating language, stalking, and physical   assaults. Terrified of losing their jobs, the women kept their problems largely to   themselves\u2014until Lois, devastated by the abuse, found the courage to file a complaint   against the company in 1984. Despite all of the obstacles the legal system threw   at them,  Lois and her fellow plaintiffs enlisted the aid of a dedicated team of   lawyers and ultimately prevailed. Weaving personal stories with legal drama, Class   Action shows how these terrifically brave women made history, although not without   enormous personal cost. Told at a thriller\u2019s pace, this is the story of how one woman   pioneered and won the first sexual harassment class action suit in the United States,   a legal milestone that immeasurably improved working conditions for American women.",

She is soon introduced to her \u201ccharge,\u201d John Cosway, a thirty-nine-year-old man whose strange behavior is vaguely explained by his mother and sisters as part of the madness that runs in the family. Weeks go by at Lydstep with little to mark the passage of time beyond John\u2019s daily walks and the amusingly provincial happenings that engross the Cosway women, and Kerstin occupies her many free hours at the Hall reading or making entries into her diary. Meanwhile, bitter wrangling among Julia Cosway and her four grown daughters becomes increasingly evident. But this is just the most obvious of the tensions that charge the old remote estate, with its sealed rooms full of mystery. Soon Kerstin will find herself in possession of knowledge she will wish she\u2019d never attained, secrets that will propel the occupants of Lydstep Old Hall headlong into sexual obsession, betrayal, and, finally, murder.Also available in a Random House Large Print edition and as an eBook",

        "Title": "The Power of the Vote: Electing Presidents, Overthrowing Dictators, and Promoting Democracy Around the World",
        "Authors": "By Schoen, Douglas E.",
        "Description": "For the last thirty years, Doug Schoen has been one of the most innovative people in Democratic politics, working behind the scenes as a political strategist for some of the world's most influential and respected politicians.  In The Power of the Vote, Schoen offers a never\u2013before\u2013seen glimpse inside his most pivotal campaigns, illustrating how a kid whose political career began leafleting on New York's Upper West Side became a force that revolutionized the American political process. From the legendary New York City mayoral race of 1977 where he helped Ed Koch claim the throne of New York to his twenty years efforts to modernize Israeli politics to Bill Clinton's reelection campaign in 1996, Schoen takes the reader through the international political landscape of the last thirty years, demonstrating how politics have evolved and how he has utilized the latest technology to help candidates win the hearts and minds of the public.  In addition, Schoen also details his valiant, decade\u2013long struggle to unseat Slobodan Milosevic not with cluster bombs and air power but through diligent campaign strategy and sophisticated polling. Revealing intimate, firsthand details about the ten\u2013year struggle in Serbia, he demonstrates that much of the conflict could have been avoided through United States support of the Serbian political process, while discussing how the most effective nation building comes not with bombs but with ballot boxes.  Despite these successes, it is in his efforts with President Bill Clinton during the mid\u20131990s that Schoen finds his most important and ultimately successful work. Helping to reshape President Clinton's image in the wake of the Republican victories in the 1994 mid\u2013term elections, Schoen molds the Clinton's positions anew, giving him a second life as a centrist Democrat, ensuring his reelection in 1996, and placing President Clinton within the pantheon of Democratic greats. Complete with a discussion of the strategies and tactics that will lead the Democrats back to the White House in 2008, The Power of the Vote is a true insider's tale from one of Washington's most successful and cherished personalities.",

        "Title": "The Italian Letter: How the Bush Administration Used a Fake Letter to Build the Case for War in Iraq",
        "Authors": "By Eisner, Peter and Royce, Knut",
        "Description": "The so-called Italian letter is a package of allegedly forged documents that seem to be based on articles stolen from the Nigerian embassy in Rome in 2001.\u00a0 The document was nonetheless adopted by the Bush administration as a basis for going to war with Iraq, even though the letter has been widely dismissed by a variety of key players in the U.S. Intelligence Community years before President Bush cited it in his 2003 State of the Union speech. Eiser, a Washington Post editor, and Royce, a legendary investigative reporter in Washington, have produced a work that takes readers from Italy, to Niger, to Iraq, and into the Washington offices of the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and inside the White House itself, to show that the document was a forgery.\u00a0 They suggest that this was not a case of finding out too late that certain intelligence information was faulty, but rather that the Bush administration used information it knew to be false to convince the Congress and the American public that Saddam Hussein was seeking materials to make a nuclear bomb.\u00a0 While news accounts and several books have exposed bits and pieces of this effort, this is the first book to offer a comprehensive, detailed account, relying on sources within the American Intelligence Community along with documents and human sources from all over the world, many of them exposed for the first time.Key players in a true-life drama that continues to unfold including Scooter Libby, Joseph Wilson, Dick Cheney, George Tenet, and even George W. Bush, occupy this stage with such lesser known figures as Italian journalist Elisabetta Burba and an intelligence freelancer named Rocca Martino.",

        "Authors": "By Davis, Will, Jr.",
        "Description": "Do we test the Holy Spirit's patience with prayer that asks nothing of him? This might sound surprising at first blush, but most people have experienced being at a prayer meeting, in church, or (gasp!) in their own personal prayer time and hearing prayers like this: \"God, bless Tom\" or \"God, just be with Sue in her need.\" Will Davis Jr., pastor of Austin Christian Fellowship, calls believers to a more risky and rewarding practice of prayer. Pray Big teaches readers how to pray with biblical, pinpoint accuracy. In other words, it teaches them prayers that get things done. From audacious prayers for miracles to mundane prayers about lost car keys, Davis takes the reader from a point of weakness to one of boldness. As a result, readers will want to pray more, they will see more results from their prayers, and they will be emboldened to ask God for everything he has promised them.",
