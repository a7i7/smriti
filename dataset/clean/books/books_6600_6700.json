        "Authors": "By Seay, Chris",
        "Description": "The Sopranos has captured audiences and awards with its portrayal of life in an Italian-American crime family. But it is more than just a mob show. It provokes us, excites us, and pries back the exterior to peek into the darkest parts of our souls. The plotlines and characters raise spiritual issues that leave us questioning our own beliefs. The Gospel According to Tony Soprano explores the many reasons why this hit series has connected so deeply with American culture and exposes the mysteries of faith, family, life, and God that permeate the show.  Published to coincide with the debut of the highly anticipated fourth season of the HBO series, The Gospel According to Tony Soprano is a fascinating book that looks through the violence and drama to the deeper moral issues. Spiritual teacher and writer Chris Seay analyzes the characters and their all-too-human behaviors, and helps us evaluate our own humanity, and ultimately our relationship with God.  Accessible, witty, and enlightening, The Gospel According to Tony Soprano is essential reading for every fan of the television show, and for anyone who wants to examine the larger questions of right and wrong.",

        "Title": "Marching in Place: The Status Quo Presidency of George Bush",
        "Authors": "By Duffy, Michael and Goodgame, Dan",
        "Description": "Michael Duffy and Dan Goodgame, Time magazine's White House correspondents, deliver the first hard-hitting, critical assessment of the Bush presidency. Marching in Place penetrates the Bush politicking, decodes the activity--and inactivity--of Bush's first term, and reframes the political choices facing us in 1992.Duffy and Goodgame began covering Bush in the summer of 1988, and since then they have watched, investigated, and chronicled his every move. They saw Bush pull together a coalition of country club Republicans, social conservatives, Reagan Democrats, and suburban independents, spinning a complex and often contradictory web of campaign promises. He was assembling a constituency not to govern, but simply to get elected.President Bush moved into the White House with a resounding electoral victory but no mandate. With his bumbling elocution, his posing with all those puppies and grandchildren, his manic engagement in sports, his nonstop travel, and of course his now famous personal touch, he was hard not to like. The public rewarded him, for more than two years, with record approval ratings. But looking behind the photo ops and small-bore political pronouncements, Duffy and Goodgame saw that Bush's frenetic manner masked a deep fear of change, that his dread of the Republican right wing and of opinion polls had hardened into a refusal to lead at home.For the last three and a half years, Bush has been marching in place, a status quo president in a revolutionary world. After the Tiananmen massacre, Bush's concern was to maintain good relations with the Chinese rulers who ordered the killings. When the Berlin Wall fell, Bush looked as if it had landed on his head and emphasized that \"we're not trying to cause trouble for anybody.\" And during the coup attempt against Gorbachev, his first instinct was not to burn any bridges with the hardline insurgents. Even in his finest hour, the Persian Gulf crisis, Bush confined his war aims to the restoration of the status quo: the removal of Iraq from Kuwait, not Saddam Hussein from Iraq.As a candidate in 1992, Bush must run on his record--as the guarantor of stability and continuity--and against his record--as an \"agent of change.\" Duffy and Goodgame remind us that Bush is a master of this sort of straddle. He promised \"a kinder and gentler nation\" but used Willie Horton and the specter of hiring quotas to exploit underlying racial fears. He pledged \"no new taxes\" and then broke his pledge rather than cut popular middle-class spending programs. He said \"I know people are hurting\" from the recession, yet waited 17 months before suggesting any new measures to help.Bush is betting that his oft-repeated promise \"to not make things worse\" will appeal to those voters who share his fear that government cannot and does not make things better. He is relying on his successful strategy of trashing his opponents' character and values. As Duffy and Goodgame demonstrate, no one should doubt George Bush when he says \"I will do what I have to do to be re-elected.\" But Marching in Place describes a president who is reluctant to lead.",

        "Description": "The Woman and the Ape is the story of a unique and unforgettable couple - Madelene and Erasmus. Madelene - a sleeping beauty drowsing gently in an alcoholic stupor - is the beautiful and disillusioned wife of Adam Burden, a distinguished behavioral scientist. Erasmus - the unlikely prince - is a 300-pound ape.Erasmus is brought to the Burdens' London home after escaping from animal smugglers. In him, Adam Burden believes he has discovered a hitherto unknown mammal, a highly intelligent anthropoid ape, the closest thing yet to a human being. If he is right, Erasmus will become the jewel of Burden's new zoo. But Madelene decides to save Erasmus, investing in her efforts all the single-mindedness she until now has reserved for drinking. The two fall in love - a love affair as emotionally and erotically charged as any female-male relationship could ever be. But Erasmus has come to England with a purpose, and eventually the couple must face the world they have sought to flee.A fable for our time, The Woman and the Ape poses searching questions about the nature of love, freedom, and humanity. It combines the farcical humor of a Marx Brothers movie with the magic of a fairy tale and the pace of a thriller.",

        "Description": "Who filled the trough? Who set the table at the banquet of greed? How has it been possible for corporate pigs to gorge themselves on grossly inflated pay packages and heaping helpings of stock options while the average American struggles to make do with their leftovers?Provocative political commentator Arianna Huffington yanks back the curtain on the unholy alliance of CEOs, politicians, lobbyists, and Wall Street bankers who have shown a brutal disregard for those in the office cubicles and on the factory floors. As she puts it: \u201cThe economic game is not supposed to be rigged like some shady ring toss on a carnival midway.\u201d Yet it has been, allowing corporate crooks to bilk the public out of trillions of dollars, magically making our pensions and 401(k)s disappear and walking away with astronomical payouts and absurdly lavish perks-for-life.The media have put their fingers on pieces of the sordid puzzle, but Pigs at the Trough presents the whole ugly picture of what\u2019s really going on for the first time\u2014a blistering, wickedly witty portrait of exactly how and why the worst and the greediest are running American business and government into the ground.Tyco\u2019s Dennis Kozlowski, Adelphia\u2019s John Rigas, and the Three Horsemen of the Enron Apocalypse\u2014Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Andrew Fastow\u2014are not just a few bad apples. They are manifestations of a megatrend in corporate leadership\u2014the rise of a callous and avaricious mind-set that is wildly out of whack with the core values of the average American. WorldCom, Enron, Adelphia, Tyco, AOL, Xerox, Merrill Lynch, and the other scandals are only the tip of the tip of the corruption iceberg.Making the case that our public watchdogs have become little more than obedient lapdogs, unwilling to bite the corporate hand that feeds them, Arianna Huffington turns the spotlight on the tough reforms we must demand from Washington. We need, she argues, to go way beyond the lame Corporate Responsibility Act if we are to stop the voracious corporate predators from eating away at the very foundations of our democracy.Devastatingly funny and powerfully indicting, Pigs at the Trough is a rousing call to arms and a must-read for all those who are outraged by the scandalous state of corporate America.",

        "Description": "Everybody in Rosalita, Texas, wondered why the Sanders family had come back to town and bought the house next door to Lou Jean Perry. It was the absolute last place they should want to be. Now, Kayla Sanders looks back on that sizzling summer of her childhood, whenthe secrets of the past cast long shadows over two families' lives.  In June 1967 Lou Jean Perry's husband, the first and only person from Rosalita killed in Vietnam, had been dead for more than a year. When thirteen-year-old Kayla first met her, a laughing Lou Jean executed a perfect backbend right there on her sparkling clean kitchen floor. It stood to reason that this bright-spirited woman -- the complete opposite of Kayla's brittle, churchgoing mother, Sarah Jo -- would become Kayla's new best friend. As the heat and madness of summer intensified, Sarah Jo's motives for moving next to Lou Jean would become clear, but not before a family's foundation cracks and crumbles, a woman is driven to the brink of madness, and a young girl discovers that passion listens not to the mind's reason but to the heart's demands. Writing about family with a poignant intensity, Cindy Eppes draws on her Southern roots to create a coming-of-age story told by a narrator straight out of Eudora Welty, yet indelibly stamped with a distinctive, contemporary style. Beautifully crafted, South of Reason shows Eppes to be an extraordinary storyteller, weaving a shimmering web shot through with the rainbow colors of life.",

Bork (former Acting Attorney General) considers radical egalitarianism and individualism as the roots of the evil that allows such horrors as feminism and abortion (\"killing for convenience\").  The author looks back at the 60s to argue that in those years of political radicalism, the degenerate cultural seeds were sown from which the US will never recover without a concentrated effort to stamp out liberalism wherever it may appear.  In paraphrase the argument looks less likely than in the context of Bork's ponderous prose, nevertheless, the core of paranoid conservatism is firmly embedded in the writing.

        "Description": "For thirty-three-year-old Mohammed al-Rehaief, this decision -- whether to risk his life and everything he held dear to save Private First Class Jessica Lynch, an American soldier he did not know -- was more than the everyday reckoning with death that permeates wartime. It was the culmination of a life spent at odds with the repressive regime that held his country.Mohammed's story is the tale of what it was like to come of age in a society where violence and betrayal were everyday events, where one in five adult males worked for the state's security apparatus, where a president-for-life demanded absolute loyalty and adulation. Despite his affluent upbringing and a well-connected uncle, Mohammed was hardly sheltered from the surreal cruelties of Iraq. He was arrested and beaten for owning a satellite dish. His young daughter lost a lung to misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery. An idolized cousin was hanged for joining an Islamic political group. A favorite teacher was carted away for making subversive statements and was never seen again.Yet even as he navigates a culture tarnished by brutality and corruption, Mohammed also reveals unexpected sides of Iraq, scenes of surprising tenderness and stubborn generosity. He writes with insight and humor about the Iraqi schools, the vagaries of its divorce law, the poignant dynamic between its fathers and sons -- between tradition and jolting change.As Mohammed offers his powerful perspective on themost publicized story of this controversial war, he emerges as an unlikely hero, a complex and charming character whose values transcend ideology: honor, compassion, and an unshakable belief in the sanctity of human life.",

Admired by his colleagues for his bluntness, decency, and courage, Warren B. Rudman gives a candid account of the legislative process as it really is.Rudman focuses on four historic Senate actions in which he played a central role: the Gramm-Rudman act - the audacious 1985 attempt to force a balanced budget on an unwilling Congress and president; the Keating Five ethics committee hearings, which revealed the thin line between campaign finance and corruption; the Iran-Contra investigation, Rudman's no-holds-barred account of the Reagan administration's biggest scandal; and the appointment of his colleague and close friend David Souter to the Supreme Court.Rudman offers vivid portraits of the men he worked with: Dole, Packwood, Baker, Helms, Gramm, and the two presidents he served under - Reagan and Bush. He writes unflinchingly about his colleagues and about the legislative process. Here is the inner world of the Senate club, revealed by the man who was often called \"the conscience of the Senate. \" Combat is one of the most important books on American politics to be published in years.",

        "Description": "In 1998, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the most admired woman in America while also becoming the most visibly wronged wife in the world. Standing by her husband, President Bill Clinton, as she and the nation learned the truth behind the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the First Lady assumed two roles--dutiful spouse and passionate defense attorney--which she had played on numerous occasions during the course of their tumultuous yet politically unified relationship. Now esteemed biographer and journalist Joyce Milton examines this formidable, fascinating woman, giving probing insight into the First Lady's character, her values and her career. In The First Partner, Milton goes behind the scenes at the Clinton White House and explores the First Lady's involvement in Travelgate, Filegate, the Health Care Task Force fiasco and fund-raising for the 1996 presidential campaign, showing how these controversies grew out of the tensions in her political partnership with Bill Clinton. Milton also describes how Mrs. Clinton's defensive reactions to her husband's chronic infidelities have often misfired and have sometimes enabled his bad behavior. She examines the differing psychologies of the President and First Lady, yet shows that when faced with political accusations, they take a similar approach of telling only as much of the truth as is necessary--a reaction that has increasingly gotten them into trouble. Meticulously reported and researched, The First Partner offers keen new understanding of this complex woman who has infuriated and confounded as many people as she has inspired.",

Or is it stumbling toward whatever comes next, dragged along by circumstance, or \"staying the course\" out of fear?Karl Albrecht, renowned business thinker and co-author of the bestseller Service America!, challenges today's business leaders to embark on a journey on The Northbound Train. His northbound train is a metaphor for achieving a focused vision of the direction your company must take to succeed and then moving inexorably toward that goal. And as Albrecht shows, this vision must always be based upon an understanding of what will create value for your customers.In The Northbound Train Albrecht provides a step-by-step guide to soul searching, strategy setting, and customer wooing. Using insightful, real-world examples of effective and ineffective processes, he helps you map out a path - a strategic success model - that your company must follow to find out what makes its business unique. He illustrates how to formulate a reality-based vision; define your company's core values and philosophy; create a company mission statement that is accurate, concise, and inspiring; evaluate your competitive strategy to see if it's based on real strengths; reach a unified concept for creating value for your customers; and distill these decisions, finally, into a few critical areas of focus.Of course, all this thinking and planning is useless if the people in your organization are not \"on board.\" Albrecht explains that \"the leader must help people in the organization understand and commit to the vision. And the leader must help them learn to do what it takes to make the vision a reality.\" The author provides advice for exactly how to lead your company (or your portion of the company) in the right direction and how to reward employees based on their real, verifiable contributions to that end-of-the-track goal.Is your company ready to board the northbound train? The trip requires just three things: the eagerness to ask fundamental business questions, the courage to listen to the answers and face what must be done, and the stamina to keep at it until the necessary changes take place. The Northbound Train will stock you with the provisions you need to be successful: the inspiration of a great business thinker and a process for keeping on track.",

        "Authors": "By Aldrich, Gary",
        "Description": "FBI special agent Gary Aldrich thought he had a plum assignment. As one of only two FBI agents posted at the White House, he performed the background checks on White House appointees - a peaceful yet dignified way to close an eventful career spent nabbing mobsters, drug dealers, and white-collar criminals.Aldrich had little interest in politics. But he was concerned with the honor of the presidency and with national security. So what he witnessed in the first months of the Clinton administration left him deeply troubled.Then alarmed. Then angered. And finally, halfway through Clinton's term, so thoroughly outraged that he felt compelled in conscience to leave the FBI.Unlimited Access is Aldrich's electrifying expose of a presidential administration with a great deal to hide - and willing to put America at risk to keep it hidden. Aldrich describes how a comprehensive security system that had been perfected through six presidencies was systematically dismantled by the Clintons so they could bring their friends into the White House - friends that previous administrations would have barred because of serious ethical or legal problems, some prosecutable.Unlimited Access also sheds new light on such White House scandals as \"Nannygate,\" \"Travelgate\" and the mysterious case of Vince Foster - whose true motive for committing suicide was revealed to Aldrich, in a secured vault, by White House security director Craig Livingstone.Throughout Unlimited Access, Aldrich relies on eyewitness testimony: his own, and that of other White House insiders. He concludes with a mock FBI \"background report\" on the President and First Lady themselves - a report that will surely come as deeply disturbing to every loyal, law-abiding American.",

        "Description": "All our lives, we seek affirmation and love from the people closest to us -- our parents and, later, our grown children. But too few of us get it. As adults, many of us feel that our aging parents still treat us like kids. As parents, many of us are sad that our adult children seem to have little use for us. When Robert Kuttner and Sharland Trotter were writing Family Re-Union, many new empty-nesters told them, \"I hope I have a better relationship with my kids than I did with my parents.\" Family Re-Union offers insights on how adults and their parents can cultivate new adult- to-adult lifelong connections and become deeper friends. It is the first book to explore this challenge over the entire life course -- from a teenager's departure for college to the impending death of an aging parent.  Kuttner, a well-known journalist, and Trotter, a clinical psychologist, conceived the book when their son had just gone off to college and their daughter was a junior in high school. The message of Family Re-Union is deepened by the unusual circumstances of its writing: a year into the work, Sharland Trotter learned she had cancer. As Sharland deals with her illness and invites her family into her journey, the book takes on additional relevance for all those facing their own mortality -- whether prematurely or at the natural end of a long life span -- and seeking to repair family relationships. But Family Re-Union will prove indispensable for all adults, from the twenty-five-year-old who finds her parents overbearing, through the forty-year-old hoping to have a better relationship with his son than he had with his father, to the seventy-year-old trying to reconnect with a middle-aged daughter, and all steps in between. These are life stages we all encounter, and Family Re-Union offers hope that, no matter what our personal circumstances, it is never too late to create loving, respectful family ties.",

His job has become routine, and his parish seems to care more about church gossip than worship or service, leaving him doubting his own effectiveness. So when the opportunity to teach for a semester at Harvard's Divinity School comes up, he leaps at the chance . . . but Faith is reluctant. After all, this New York City girl has just gotten used to life in Aleford -- and now she has to move?

Thirteen years before, Richard Morgan had swept Faith off her feet, then disappeared. But the intelligent, handsome man's return is a happy one for Faith as their friendship is renewed. Back in Cambridge, though, something is amiss in the temporary Fairchilds' residence. Faith discovers a diary hidden in the attic by a woman living there in 1946. It reveals unspeakable horror, and soon dark secrets seem to permeate every room.

But when the capsule is found missing and Magdalena's guest Buzzy Porter is found dead, suspicions flare.Everyone knew that Buzzy was quite fond of playing practical jokes - but is that reason enough for murder?

        "Title": "Things Worth Fighting for: Collected Writings",
        "Authors": "By Kelly, Michael",
        "Description": "The collected articles and columns of Michael Kelly, award-winning reporter, war correspondent, columnist, and editor, whose passion for the good story and whose candor and wit made him one of the foremost journalists of our time.  Michael Kelly called himself a \"colored lights\" sort of person-a regular guy, not a member of the elite \"white light\" crowd-when it came to his holiday decorations, his writing, and his zest for life. His career reflected myriad colors: he wrote for a large variety of publications, covering a multitude of topics-political, international, and personal-with singular insight, passion, and wit. This collection of his most memorable magazine and newspaper stories and columns-drawn from the Washington Post, New York Times, The New Yorker, The New Republic, and other publications-puts on full display the dazzling panoply of his gifts: for physical description and scene setting; for telling detail, brilliant simile, and satirical insight; for prose that is at once mathematically precise and lyrical.  Here are the searing portraits of Ted Kennedy, Jesse Jackson, H. Ross Perot, and other seminal political figures of our time that won Kelly national attention. Here are the stunning dispatches from the first Gulf War that earned him the National Magazine Award for reporting and burnished his journalistic legend. Here are the fierce columns and landmark cover stories that raised disturbing questions about Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the deeply incestuous relationship between Washington, D.C.'s political and media cultures. And here are the loving family portraits and hilarious social commentaries.  Colored Lights represents the body of work of a journalist who demonstrated time and again a surpassing talent for penetrating to the heart of the matter, for advancing far beyond the headlines and surface appearances of people and events to find their true meanings, for getting the story other writers missed and telling it with a verve few other writers could match.",

Several weeks after the death of a female patient in a terrible fire, the poet Algernon Swinburne follows a mysterious woman through the shadows toward a remarkable event at once enthralling, stimulating, and terrifying beneath the streets of London. Years later, at the start of a new century, a struggling young artist, Radborne Comstock, is introduced to a ravishing beauty who immediately becomes his muse, his desire, and his greatest torment. It is a legacy of pleasure and madness that will be passed down to his grandson, the dilettante actor Valentine Comstock, who is plagued by disturbing and increasingly erotic visions. And in the present day a journalist named Daniel Rowlands is seduced by the bewitching and mercurial Larkin Meade, who holds the key to lost artistic masterpieces, and to secrets too devastating to imagine.What connects these men -- and others whose grand destinies are to imagine and create -- is one woman. Eternal, unknowable, the very ideal of beauty and desirability, she exists somewhere beyond the boundaries of time, a sensuous dream of flesh and fantasy to inspire or destroy, an immortal lover ... or an angel of death.",

But I want to tell you about the parts that didn't get on television or in the paper, the serious parts and the not-so-serious parts, the good times I had, and the presidents, senators, correspondents, big-time crooks, and small-time swindlers I came to know. Here are the stories I tell my friends, and they are the stories I want to share with you.\"  Schieffer is not only broadcast journalism's most experienced Washington reporter, but one of its best natural writers.

Is it possible to tell the story of a generation and a city through the history of a restaurant? Ella Brady thinks so. She wants to film a documentary about Quentins that will capture the spirit of Dublin from the 1970s to the present day. After all, the restaurant saw the people of a city become more confident in everything, from their lifestyles to the food that they chose to eat. And Quentins has a thousand stories to tell: tales of love, of betrayal, of revenge; of times when it looked ready for success and of times when it seemed as if it must close in failure.  In Maeve Binchy's magical new book you will meet new friends and old. The twins from Scarlet Feather, Signora from Evening Class, and Ria from Tara Road all drop by, as do a host of new friends-Mon, the ever-cheerful Australian waitress, and Blouse Brennan, whose simplicity disguises a sharp mind and a heart of gold.  Quentins is presided over by the apparently unflappable Patrick and Brenda Brennan, whose efforts have made the place a legend in the life of Dubliners and visitors alike. But even the Brennans have a story, and a problem, that is hidden from the public gaze.  As Ella uncovers more and more of what has gone on at Quentins, she begins to question the wisdom of capturing it all in a documentary. Are there some stories that are too sacred to be told, some secrets that must be kept?  By getting to know the people that pass through the doors of Quentins, Ella has finally gotten to know herself.",

Obviously, a major lifestyle change is seriously called for, which is why the distraught interior landscape designer says good-bye to Manhattan and late-night lattes with pal Nina, and hello to a farmhouse on ten acres in tiny, backwater Manshire, Vermont, hoping to meet the ultimate, all-organic country man (without too much facial hair) to keep her warm in those frosty New England winters.Instead, Peg finds herself at Inward Bound -- a proactive adult-education retreat for the hapless and hopelessly lovelorn -- to try to lift her dreaded \"girlfriend curse.\" A steamy (and expressly forbidden) dalliance with gorgeous woman-eater Ray probably isn't going to help cure her. But some romantic insight could arise from her attraction to Linus, Inward Bound's sexy, scruffy, smart and still-single founder.

Is there anything they don't know about each other?And then, on an ordinary Tuesday morning, one of their marriages violently crashes. Jessie Chickery, the prettiest, the most enviable of them all, shoots (in anger? in despair? in self-defense?) the husband she's always been obsessively in love with: Pete, the most irresistible guy in town - the sexiest, the craziest, the most charming, and sometimes a little scary.

When Philip Tempest - charming, devastatingly handsome, and almost twice Rosamond's age - mysteriously appears one stormy night, he finds a peach ripe for the plucking.Instead of finding the freedom she craves, Rosamond is caught up in a web of intrigue, cruelty, and deceit stretching far back into the strange past of the man she must call her husband. Fearful that her spirit will be broken, she flees Tempest's clutches, and so the chase begins - across Italy, across France and Germany, from Parisian garret to mental asylum, from convent to chateau. But no sooner does she find each new refuge than Philip Tempest hunts her down - for he has never allowed anything he wants to escape, and Rosamond has become his obsession.",

        "Description": "Poor Inspector Gallagher -- his premonition was right. Sister Mary Helen is once more in the middle of a homicide case. Not that she wants to be. No one would envy the poor nun, who finds herself holding a dying young woman -- shot to death in the street almost directly outside the Refuge for homeless women where Mary Helen volunteers. And even while she grieves over the loss of life, Mary Helen spots something odd about the victim. Although she is wearing near-rags, her skin is unblemished and healthy-looking. Her perfect teeth are white and unstained. She doesn't look like a woman whose life has been spent in poverty, in the streets. Mary Helen's feeling is borne out when she discovers that the dead woman was a Vice Department officer trying to find the people responsible for a neighborhood prostitute ring. And in spite of her own conscience warning her, the old nun feels that since the murder happened in front of HER refuge, it is her duty to find the officer's killer. She justifies this by telling herself that her connections with the women who use the Refuge put her in a unique position to get some inside information about what is going on in their neighborhood. After all, isn't one of the Refuge's very own women, Geraldine, the aunt of Junior Johnson? And isn't Junior just about the most powerful and knowledgeable man in the 'hood? So Sister Mary Helen plunges in, determined to find Sarah Spencer's killer. Her \"invasion\" of the case enrages Inspector Gallagher, but if she is to succeed, his further fury will be well worth Mary Helen's triumph. The police officers assigned to the crimes that turn out to be \"hers\" might make a case that someone Mary Helen's age is running a serious risk when she deals with criminals and their world. But the delightful old nun has the weapons of her logical mind, and her determination. And just maybe Someone whom she serves is rooting for her. In any case, she is able to work out of perilous situations, come up with commonsense answers, and gather a huge circle of loving fans as she meddles in murder.",

Her self-imposed mission: move to the slower-paced, friendly, and vastly more affordable midwestern town of Prairie City, USA. Her search includes but is not limited to: a decently sized apartment with a few aesthetic qualities; a job that is not all about pleasing her conniving, urban terror of a boss; the love of a good man; and, maybe, a dog. And so Lucinda departs with a plan to deliver televised reports to her New York audience about the sweeping landscapes, charming farmsteads, and quirky locals that will constitute her newfound quality of life.But when Lucinda falls for Mason Clay, the quirkiest local of all, her naivete about the real world leads her down an unexpected path. In an effort to portray her life as a romantic, rural, idyll (in which she takes the role of Sam Shepard's leading lady or \"the kind of woman Lyle Lovett might write a song about\"), Lucinda moves with Mason into a drafty farmhouse, where she must cope with his children, an ever-growing menagerie of farm animals, and the harshest winter the region has seen in twenty years. Lucinda is so determined to live out her fantasy that not even Mason's radical mood swings and eventual bout with addiction can deter her. In other words - simplicity isn't as simple as it is cracked up to be.Through a series of unexpected turns, help from quarters where she least expects it, and a growing love of a landscape that is undeniably real, Lucinda comes to realize that \"quality of life\" is much more complicated - and ultimately richer - than she ever imagined.",

And what better place to find such a person than in a society set up to honor the dubious talents of Susannah and Joshua Sneddon?Not quite in the league of the Brontes, Susannah and Joshua toiled at their creative tasks in a remote cottage in a tiny Yorkshire village in the early years of this century. Neither wrote great literature, but Susannah's work was always the more popular. Perhaps that's why Joshua one day killed his sister with an ax and shot himself in the head.Now, many years later, there's a surprising new interest in the Sneddons, seemingly inspired by entrepreneur Gerald Suzman. Suzman has bought the Sneddon homestead, with plans to open it as a museum and to found a literary society known as the Sneddon Fellowship.Sneddon fans from as far away as America, Norway, and Japan have gathered at Suzman's invitation for the inaugural Sneddon Weekend. Detective Constable Charlie Peace has come, too, intrigued by Suzman's sudden literary interest in the obscure Yorkshire siblings. Suzman's history indicates a far greater affinity for wealth than for literature, so he must have discovered an unlikely source of profit in the Fellowship. But where?Charlie fears that elderly American Lettie Farraday may know too much for her own good. Lettie, who has returned to the village of her birth for the first time in more than fifty years, is the only conferee who personally knew the Sneddons. Too much knowledge may be dangerous.To read a new Robert Barnard novel is to appreciate once again the extraordinary range and depth of one of the greatest of contemporary crime writers. A Hovering of Vultures is vintage Barnard from a writer at the peak of his powers.",
