        "Description": "Northanger Abbey is about the misadventures of Catherine Morland, young, ingenuous, and mettlesome, and an indefatigable reader of Gothic novels. Their romantic excess and dark overstatement feed her imagination, as tyrannical fathers and diabolical villains work their evil on forlorn heroines in isolated settings. What could be more remote from the uneventful securities of life in the midland counties of England? Yet as Austen brilliantly contrasts fiction with reality, ordinary life takes a more sinister turn, and edginess and circumspection are reaffirmed alongside comedy and literary burlesque.",

        "Description": "Tapas Made Easy is the perfect book for anyone who wants to recreate the rich flavours and delicious dishes of Spain's greatest culinary tradition. Small food is enjoying a renaissance, perhaps because it is ideal for entertaining. It is possible to produce a whole range of different dishes to cater for a number of tastes, all with the minimum of fuss. It is also great food for sharing, to be eaten in the company of friends, with a glass of wine. The origin of the word comes from tapar, meaning to cover, apparently referring to slices of bread or cheese that were used to cover glasses. Now a thriving tradition, the range of tapas dishes has extended to include more substantial snacks, from albondigas (meatballs) to the classic tortilla espa?ola to the famous patatas bravas. Certain ingredients are essential for creating tapas: plump stuffed olives, marinated anchovies, handfuls of fresh parsley and, of course, smoked pimenton (paprika) are all storecupboard essentials. The tapas in this book cover a range of flavours and Spanish food lovers will find all the classics here, as well as some more unusual dishes. The recipes are divided into the following chapters: Cocktail Sticks, Skewers, Tostas and Tarteletas, showing that there are many different ways of serving tapas dishes. Beautifully photographed and designed throughout, this is the perfect book for anyone interested in authentic Spanish tapas.",

        "Description": "Today the world faces the prospect of a devastating mass extinction, as species disappear at a rate that is many times faster than at any previous time in the earth's history. Finding ways to preserve the planet's rich variety of species is the challenge being taken up by conservation biologists, scientists who use their knowledge of ecology, genetics, and population dynamics to develop strategies for conserving biodiversity based on scientific principles.What really is the extent of biodiversity loss and how does one go about figuring it out? Why is biodiversity valuable for the earth and ourselves, and what can be done to conserve it? These are the questions that Andrew Dobson, a leading researcher and Princeton professor of ecology and epidemiology, addresses in his book.Beginning with discussions of species diversity, extinction rates, and how species endangerment is determined, Dobson goes on to discuss what is perhaps the book's most fascinating topic: the ins and outs of attempts to manage endangered species and the economics of different conservation strategies. The author describes the changes in animal populations before and after management attempts - from fish to whales, from the ivory trade in elephants to sales of rhino horns - and he analyzes the function of zoos and attempts to reintroduce species into the wild.",

        "Description": "Newspaperwoman, novelist, and ardent advocate of women's rights, Lydia Maria Child (1802\u20131880) was recognized as one of the foremost female authors of her day. Married at 25 to a charming dreamer whose irresponsible behavior quickly depleted their meager earnings, she compiled this book (based, very likely, on personal experience) for women of less than moderate means. \"Save!\" \"Share!\" \"Do not destroy!\" were maxims she repeatedly stressed. Along with these words to live by, she also offered simply written recipes for roasting a pig, preparing a calf's head and buffalo tongue, as well as fixing corned beef, hasty pudding, carrot pie, apple water, cranberry pudding, and scores of other tasty and filling dishes. Her advice for non-culinary matters included suggestions for removing grease spots; cleaning pearls and white kid gloves; relieving chilblains, dysentery, and the night sweats; educating one's daughters; and dozens of other domestic concerns. First published in 1832, this fascinating book was a \"must\" for every bride of the mid-1800s. Enhanced with a new introduction by cookbook authority Jan Longone, it will delight today's homemakers, antiquarians, and nostalgia enthusiasts with its charming glimpse into the kitchens and homes of the past.",

        "Description": "What did the Declaration declare? An enduring mythology has grown up around the creation of the Declaration of Independence. Generations of Americans believe that Jefferson wrote it in his Philadelphia study, influenced only by the stirring of great events around him. Challenging this romantic ideal, the five historians included here find that the document was the result of many influences and that it may have even been a collaborative writing effort on the congressional floor. Investigating various angles of the argument, the authors pose a variety of opinions on the Declaration's authorship, influences, and ultimate impact.",

Everything is set for her to have the wedding she'd always fantasized about, and has been fully paid for by her groom, Rossi Evans. There is only one thing wrong.  .  .Micah won't be there. Micah has long since reached the peak of her frustration. Unbeknownst to Rossi, he's already been dismissed, but instead of declining his proposal and breaking the engagement, Micah happily moves forward.  .  .with hidden intentions. Armed with Rossi's credit cards, Micah expertly feigns the role of an anxious and ecstatic bride-to-be, sparing no expense for their wedding, yet telling no one of her plans. The day of the wedding, she arrives as scheduled to the church for her hair and make up, then makes a request to her bridesmaids to allow her to spend her last few moments of singleness by herself. Micah uses this opportunity to slip out the side door, jump in her rented car and hot-foot it to the airport. By the time Rossi realizes that he (and the entire wedding party) has been standing at the alter, Micah is in Charlotte, NC, easing into a tub of warm bubbles, enjoying a glass of wine and leafing through her favorite magazine. When Micah and Rossi's paths cross again, Micah is caught totally off guard by the situation, and by the feelings that have been simmering deep inside her heart, despite her denial. Will Micah embrace love this second time around, having set it free the first time?",

        "Description": "New research in nutrition and weight loss has revealed an amazing discovery: the brain\u2014virtually neglected in all other diet plans\u2014is the most important organ in dieting. Dieters can actually lose weight by eating foods, nutrients, teas, and spices that change the chemical balance of the brain for permanent weight loss\u2014a major factor contributing to how quickly the body ages. In fact, everyone can take years off their age by changing their brain chemistry.      In Younger (Thinner) You Diet, Dr. Eric Braverman expands upon concepts introduced in Younger You to present a totally new approach to lifelong weight management, where the key is not found in counting carbs, fat grams, or calories. Obesity is a brain chemical imbalance, an addictive disorder, treated successfully only through the combined approach of diet, nutrients, and hormones. One of the foremost experts in integrative medicine, known for his work on the brain-body connection, Dr. Braverman teaches readers:-which foods naturally boost the body's production of dopamine, the chemical in the brain that tells the body to start its fat-burning engine-how to choose foods, supplements, teas, and spices\u2014even hormones and medicine\u2014to avoid the effects of other aging organs that can destroy one's metabolism-how to personalize the diet for specific health concerns, such as heart problems, aging skin, weak muscles, and achy joints     Eliminating the frustration and deprivation of conventional dieting, Younger (Thinner) You Diet will help anyone turn back the clock to a slimmer, healthier, younger you.",

But the musical and haunted world of his past is morphing into just another strip of middle America, corrupted with pawn shops, meth labs, Clear Channel radio, and-if Cyrus's brother has his way-a golfer's paradise. As news of a murderess in the woods confounds the memories of his sister gone missing long ago, this prodigal son is drawn deeper into the cave- riddled realm of stalwarts and misfits he knew in his youth. What he discovers there will change everything.  A phantasmagoric tale of American music set during the crucible of its changing industry, Miss Me When I'm Gone plumbs our storied melodies for their essential purpose-to mine the soul for the longing, the passion, the love and rage that drive us.",

Once an untouchable member of England's establishment\u2014a world-famous art historian and a man knighted by the Queen of England\u2014in a single stroke Anthony Blunt became an object of universal hatred when, in 1979, Margaret Thatcher exposed him as a Soviet spy. In  Anthony Blunt: His Lives , Miranda Carter shows how one man lived out opposing trends of his century\u2014first as a rebel against his class, then as its epitome\u2014and yet embodied a deeper paradox. In the 1920s, Blunt was a member of the Bloomsbury circle; in the 1930s he was a left-wing intellectual; in the 50s and 60s he became a camouflaged member of the Establishment. Until his treachery was made public, Blunt was a world-famous art historian, recognized for his ground-breaking work on Poussin, Italian art, and old master drawings; at the Courtauld Institute he trained a whole generation of academics and curators. And yet even as he ascended from rebellion into outward conformity, he was a homosexual when homosexuality was a crime, and a traitor when the penalty was death. How could one man contain so many contradictions? The layers of secrecy upon which Blunt's life depended are here stripped away for the first time, using testimony from those who knew Blunt well but have until now kept silent and documents from sealed Russian archives, including a secret autobiography Blunt wrote for his controllers. Miranda Carter's  Anthony Blunt  is the first full biography of the mythical Cold War warrior, and is at once an astonishing history of one the century's greatest deceits and a deeply nuanced account of fifty years in the British power elite, as experienced by one deep inside who wished to bring it down.",

        "Authors": "By Reichert, John",
        "Description": "In this commonsense approach to the fundamental issues involved in understanding and evaluating literary works, John Reichert examines the method and structure of rational critical argument and its relationship to the nature of reading. With clarity and vigor, he shows how we can cut through competing critical languages to sort right readings from wrong ones, better from worse. His incisive analyses are augmented by illustrations from distinguished critics writing about major literary works. Reichert considers criticism broadly as the imparting of one's understanding of a poem or play or novel to another reader. When the rhetorical function of critical language is recognized, seemingly distinct approaches to literature can be seen as different though often compatible means to a single end. He contends that the critic's job is not to report a personal response but to describe how a reader\u2014any reader\u2014ought to respond to a particular work. This necessitates postulating the author's intention at every turn, so that criticism becomes an account of what the author does to the reader by means of the work. Taking off from recent developments in the philosophy of language, Reichert proposes answers to questions such as: What is involved in the understanding of\u00a0metaphor, irony, and fiction? What knowledge must the reader bring to the text to understand it? And in what ways may the meaning of the text be regarded as stable? He sets out to refute attempts by Beardsley, Peckham, Kermode, Culler, and Ellis, among others, to define the essential nature or function of literature. Finally, with a simple account of how the everyday assessments we make of people and actions apply to literary works, Reichert demonstrates that full evaluative arguments are never purely formal or \"literary,\" but always, in a broad sense, moral.",
