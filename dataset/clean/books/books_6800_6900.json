In his critically acclaimed and bestselling new book, Roger Kahn presents the story of this supreme war of wits and the people who changed the course of baseball by playing, what he calls, chess at 90 miles an hour. In The Head Game, Kahn investigates not only grips, tactics, and physics, but also the intelligence, maturity, and competitive fire that has inspired some of the greatest hurlers in history.By covering renowned pitchers and pitching minds-from Christy Mathewson, Cy Young, Don Drysdale, Bob Gibson, and Bruce Sutter to today's reigning pitching coach, Leo Mazzone-Roger Kahn sheds new light on baseball's most pivotal contest. A delightful and edifying tour of America's favorite pastime seen through the pitcher's eyes, The Head Game \"is as lively and familiar and old-shoe as the game itself, even today\" (Los Angeles Times).",

        "Description": "Mexico has long held sway over the passions of travelers and has been featured in the writings of such keen observers as Katherine Anne Porter, Paul Bowles, Langston Hughes, Elizabeth Borton de Trevino, and John Steinbeck. Their eyewitness accounts are gathered with those of a score of other writers in this remarkable collection of some of the best travel writing ever about some of the most popular destinations for travelers, from Cabo San Lucas to Mexico City to Yucatan.Says editor Alan Ryan about this collection, \"I wanted a book that would be like a trunk filled with letters from a branch of the family that's lived and traveled for many years in Mexico. Some of these imaginary relatives loved the country and made it their own. Some visited briefly, saw what there was to see, and left. A few disliked it, complained about everything, and couldn't wait to get away. All of them sent back reports.\" These personal \"reports\" accentuate Mexico's diversity and provide an incomparably richer perspective of this complex country than could possibly be offered by any standard guidebook. As Booklist commented in an exultant boxed review, this is a \"sometimes startling collection that would indeed make a fine traveling companion.\"",

In his most powerful and personal book yet, this media powerhouse and unstoppable truth-teller takes on those individuals and institutions in American life who are failing in their duties \u2013 big-time.  In his inimitable style, mixing wit, pugnacity, and plain common sense, O\u2019Reilly kicks butt and takes (and also names) names \u2013 from crooked corporate weasels to venal politicians to lazy and/or politically correct bureaucrats to sexually predatory priests and the Church hierarchy that protects them to a media establishment rife with political bias and economically hooked on violence and smut.  At the same time that he calls the famous and powerful to account, he dares to get personal, questioning just how much our closest friends, families, and lovers do look out for us, and delivering a powerful message about personal responsibility and self-reliance in an uncertain world.  He forces us to ask just how much genuine altruism is left in a society that thrives on self-indulgence and ruthless competition.Who\u2019s Looking Out for You? is a book that boldly confronts our worst fears and biggest problems in a post-9/11, post-corporate-meltdown world.  Its sage, candid advice on regaining control and trust in these troubled times will resonate with the millions of readers and viewers who have come to believe in Bill O\u2019Reilly as the man who speaks for them.",

        "Title": "Banana Republicans: How the Right Wing is Turning America Into a One-Party State",
        "Authors": "By Stauber, John C. and Rampton, Sheldon",
        "Description": "The bestselling authors of Weapons of Mass Deception expose how the \"right-wing conspiracy,\" as represented by the GOP and its mouthpieces in media, lobbying groups, and the legal system, is undermining dissent and squelching pluralistic politics in America.  The U.S. economy is on the ropes, fear grips the nation, and we are embroiled in two overseas military quagmires with no end in sight. Outside its borders, the United States is hated and feared as never before.  For the first time in living memory, a single party-the Republicans-controls every major institution of the federal government: the White House, the Supreme Court, the Senate and House of Representatives-not to mention the \"fourth branch of government,\" the mass media. How did this come to pass?  Banana Republicans reveals how the national GOP maintains its hold on power through the systematic manipulation of the electoral system, the courts, the media, and the lobbying establishment. The book examines:  * The legacy of the Florida ballot scandal, and how it has played out in the recall movement in California-and other states, where recall efforts are under way-and in the redistricting controversy in Texas. * How a GOP echo chamber systematically spreads its views through conservative media giants-e.g., Clear Channel, Fox-and highly placed columnists, journalists, and opinion makers. * How the Bush administration is loading the federal courts with a generation of demagogues, and smearing the names of legislators who attempt to stand in its way. * How House Majority Leader Tom DeLay has strong-armed traditional lobbying firms into exclusively hiring Republicans, so that even K Street is political, rather than merely opportunistic. * How the GOP has equated dissent with treason-e.g., Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accusing war critics of abetting terrorism. * How the Bush administration uses its power to punish dissent, such as the leaking of a CIA agent's name to the press, and unprecedented lawsuits against activist organizations such as Greenpeace.",

        "Authors": "By Mattingly, Stacy, Curry, Dayna, and Mercer, Heather",
        "Description": "The gripping and inspiring story of two extraordinary women--from their imprisonment by the Taliban to their rescue by U.S. Special Forces. When Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer arrived in Afghanistan, they had come to help bring a better life and a little hope to some of the poorest and most oppressed people in the world. Within a few months, their lives were thrown into chaos as they became pawns in historic international events.  They were arrested by the ruling Taliban government for teaching about Christianity to the people with whom they worked.  In the middle of their trial, the events of September 11, 2001, led to the international war on terrorism, with the Taliban a primary target.  While many feared Curry and Mercer could not survive in the midst of war, Americans nonetheless prayed for their safe return, and in November their prayers were answered.In Prisoners of Hope, Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer tell the story of their work in Afghanistan, their love for the people they served, their arrest, trial, and imprisonment by the Taliban, and their rescue by U.S. Special Forces. The heart of the book will discuss how two middle-class American women decided to leave the comforts of home in exchange for the opportunity to serve the disadvantaged, and how their faith motivated them and sustained them through the events that followed.  Their story is a magnificent narrative of ordinary women caught in extraordinary circumstances as a result of their commitment to serve the poorest and most oppressed women and children in the world. This book will be inspiring to those who seek a purpose greater than themselves.",

        "Description": "From the author of Don't Eat Your Heart Out and other bestselling books on diet and healthy living that together have over 1.8 million copies in print, here is a \"how-to\" book providing information and motivation for readers to take control of their cardiac health. In CHOICES FOR A HEALTHY HEART, Piscatella broadens his focus to the major lifestyle factors-diet, exercise, stress, and smoking-which affect cardiac fitness, whether as rehabilitation for heart patients or preventive action for people at risk.  His information gives new insight into how healthy choices and changes can be made to control heart disease, which is a culturally induced epidemic affecting 5.5 million Americans. He reveals why people under stress have difficulty ridding themselves of cholesterol. He examines how poor exercise habits have contributed to heart disease in adults-and in children. He investigates the effect of smoking in real terms: one pack of cigarettes a day produces as much strain on the heart as being 100 pounds overweight. And, he continues to provide solid dietary principles for reducing cholesterol, keeping blood pressure in line, and controlling weight.  Exploding the myths asserted by the $12-billion weight-loss industry, Piscatella thoroughly and refreshingly affirms that a heart-healthy diet and exercise program is the most effective way to lose excess fat and keep it off forever.  Bernie Piscatella's 200 new easy-to-follow recipes have been calculated for calorie counts and fat content and include such zesty dishes as Fettucini with Scallops and Pesto, Veal Chops with Lemon and Pepper, and Banana Cream Pudding. 440,000 copies in print.",

        "Description": "The Book on Bush is the first comprehensive critique of a president who is governing on a right wing and a prayer. In carefully documented detail, Eric Alterman and Mark Green, two of the leading progressive authors/advocates in the country, not only trace the guiding ideology that runs through a wide range of W's policies but also expose a presidential decision-making process that, rather than weighing facts to arrive at conclusions, begins with conclusions and then searches for supporting facts.While other commentators and authors have plumbed a particular policy (or policies) or chronicled his provable deceptions, Alterman and Green connect the dots of what's behind all the policies and prevarications. The Book on Bush reveals a president who, while determinedly uninformed, uncurious, and unyielding, is messianic in pursuing the goals of his three leading constituencies: the religious right, big business, and neoconservatives. With few exceptions, the interests of these groups have been served so effectively that the result for America is nothing less than the attempted rolling back of the progressive gains of the past century.",

There the bewitching lass is sure to find a suitable husband who will not be intimidated by her suspicious uncles and who is more appealing than the many local suitors whom her uncles have already deemed unworthy. But before she begins her pursuit of a new life, Melissa is distracted by an intriguing gentleman stranger she encounters on her grandfather's lands.Lincoln Ross Burnett is no stranger to Scotland, however. The seventeenth Viscount Cambury, Lincoln once called this fair land home -- until as a boy of twelve he was sent away to live with relatives in London after his father's death. To stay would surely have meant his own demise, for a bitter feud was raging around him, marking young Lincoln as a target of a brutal gang of \"savages\" who went by the name MacFearsons.Now as he restlessly roams the countryside he so loved as a child, Lincoln can feel the anger and bitterness returning -- only to be dispelled by the beauty of the lady who stands before him. Though they part after but a few spoken words, the damage has been done: Lincoln's heart has been claimed forever, and he will never be complete again until Melissa MacGregor is his bride.Though destiny is carrying them along separate paths, Lincoln knows he will pursue Melissa to London ... and to the ends of the earth, if necessary. But ties of blood and duty have made his heart's obsession with the enchanting beauty not only desperate but quite dangerous. For the woman Lincoln must have is the niece of those who, even now, are sworn to his destruction, and who are willing to dog his every step, even following two yearning souls fated to be lovers into the glittering world of the London ton. The longtime feud is raging hotter than ever before -- and even the irresistible shared passion of Lincoln and Melissa may not be powerful enough to withstand its devastating fire.",

What about the ripping sound behind my eyes, the starchy tearing of fabric, end to end; what about the need I have to curl up my knees when I sleep? For all of her life, 44 year old Reta Winters has enjoyed the useful monotony of happiness: a loving family, good friends, growing success as a writer of light 'summertime' fiction. But this placid existence is cracked wide open when her beloved eldest daughter, Norah, drops out to sit on a gritty street corner, silent but for the sign around her neck that reads 'GOODNESS.' Reta's search for what drove her daughter to such a desperate statement turns into an unflinching and surprisingly funny meditation on where we find meaning and hope. Warmth, passion and wisdom come together in Shields' remarkably supple prose. Unless, a harrowing but ultimately consoling story of one family's anguish and healing, proves her mastery of extraordinary fictions about ordinary life.",

Yet in the parlance of the Tiger Woods generation, it's also a wickedly good game -- rich, glamorous, and more popular than ever.When we think about golf -- as it is played at its highest level -- we think of three names: Tiger Woods, the most famous sports figure in the world today, Arnold Palmer, the father of modern golf, and Jack Nicklaus, the game's greatest champion.In this penetrating, forty-year history of men's professional golf, acclaimed author Howard Sounes tells the story of the modern game through the lives of its greatest icons. With unprecedented access to players and their closest associates, Sounes reveals the personal lives, rivalries, wealth, and business dealings of these remarkable men, as well as the murky history of a game that has been marred by racism and sex discrimination. Among the many revelations, the complete and true story of Tiger Woods and his family background is untangled, uncovering surprising new details that inspire the golfer's father to exclaim, \"Hell, you taught me some things about my life I never knew about!\"Earl Woods and other members of Tiger Woods's family, his friends, girlfriends, caddies, coaches, and business associates were among the 150 people interviewed over two years of research. Others included Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, fellow champions such as Ernie Els, Gary Player, Tony Jacklin, and Tom Watson, and golf moguls such as Mark H. McCormack, billionaire founder of the sports agency IMG.The Wicked Game is a compelling story of talent, fame, wealth, and power.

General Tom Franks embodies those qualities: strength, experience, a keen mind, energy, honor, good humor, and a deep loyalty to his troops and to his country. \"Tom Franks is truly a soldier's soldier.\"-- Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  The Commander in Chief of the United States Central Command from July 2000 through July 2003, General Tommy Franks made history by leading American and Coalition forces to victory in Afghanistan and Iraq -- the decisive battles that launched the war on terrorism.  In this riveting memoir, General Franks retraces his journey from a small-town boyhood in Oklahoma and Midland, Texas, through a lifetime of military service -- including his heroic tour as an Artillery officer in Vietnam, where he was wounded three times. A reform-minded Cold War commander and a shrewd tactician during Operation Desert Storm, Franks took command of CENTCOM at the dawn of what he calls a \"crease in history\" -- becoming the senior American military officer in the most dangerous region on earth.  Now, drawing on his own recollections and military records declassified for this book, Franks offers the first true insider's account of the war on terrorism that has changed the world since September 11, 2001. He puts you in the Operations Center for the launch of Operation Enduring Freedom just weeks after 9/11, capturing its uncertain early days and the historic victory that followed. He traces his relationship with the demanding Donald Rumsfeld, as early tensions over the pace of the campaign gave way to a strong and friendly collaboration.  When President Bush focused world attention on the threat of Iraq, Franks seized the moment to implement a bold new vision of joint warfare in planning Operation Iraqi Freedom. Rejecting Desert Storm\u2013style massive troop deployment in favor of flexibility and speed, Franks was questioned by the defense establishment -- including Secretary of State Colin Powell. Yet his vision was proven on the ground: Within three weeks, Baghdad had fallen.American Soldier is filled with revelation. Franks describes the covert diplomacy that helped him secure international cooperation for the war, and reveals the role of foreign leaders -- and a critical double agent code-named \"April Fool\" -- in the most successful military deception since D-Day in 1944. He speaks frankly of intelligence shortcomings that endangered our troops, and of the credible WMD threats -- including eleventh-hour warnings from Arab leaders -- that influenced every planning decision. He offers an unvarnished portrait of the \"disruptive and divisive\" Washington bureaucracy, and\u00a0a candid assessment\u00a0of the war's aftermath. Yet in the end, as American Soldier demonstrates, the battles in Afghanistan and Iraq remain heroic victories -- wars of liberation won by troops whose valor was \"unequalled,\" Franks writes, \"by anything in the annals of war.\" Few individuals have the chance to contribute so much of themselves to the American story as General Tommy Franks. In American Soldier, he captures it all.",

        "Authors": "By Gross, John (EDT)",
        "Description": "\"Comic verse,\" writes editor John Gross, \"is verse that is designed to amuse--and perhaps that is as far as any attempt at a definition ought to go.\" In The Oxford Book of Comic Verse, Gross has combed the annals of literature in English from the middle ages to the present, gathering poems that provoke laughter, smiles, and even reflections on the human condition--but always poems that amuse.    From limericks to social satire, The Oxford Book of Comic Verse offers a remarkable collection of outstanding light poetry. Gross has brought together the finest writers in the history of the English language--from Chaucer and Skelton to Shakespeare and Swift, Lord Byron to Robert Browning, Emily Dickinson to John Updike--offering delightful examples of their comic verse.  Many of these lines dance with whimsy, such as John Skelton's Colin Clout (\"For though my rhyme be ragged,/ Tattered and jagged,/ Rudely rain-beaten,/ Rusty and moth-eaten,/ If ye take well therewith,/ It hath in it some pith\"); others float heavier thoughts on light rhymes--as in Matthew Prior's succinct Human Life (\"What trifling coil do we poor mortals keep;/ Wake, eat, and drink, evacuate and sleep.\").  The range of writers who have composed comic verse is astonishing, as is the delight of the poems themselves. Here we read T.S. Eliot mocking himself (\"How unpleasant to meet Mr. Eliot!/ With his features of clerical cut\"); poet and Soviet historian Robert Conquest, mingling his two professions in a limerick (\"There was a great Marxist called Lenin/ Who did two or three million men in/ --That's a lot to have done in/ --But where he did one in/ That grand Marxist Stalin did ten in\"); and Wendy Cope commenting on her disillusionment with poets (\"I used to think all poets were Byronic./ They're mostly wicked as ginless tonic/ And wild as pension plans\"). And along the way, we are treated to witty song lyrics as well, from First World War soldiers' tunes, to Irving Berlin, to Cole Porter, to Lorenz Hart (\"When love congeals/It soon reveals/ the faint aroma of performing seals/The double-crossing of a pair of heels/I wish I were in love again!\").  Whether it comes from anonymous popular culture or the icons of the literary canon, comic verse has been a source of pleasure and diversion through the ages--a combination of wit, verbal artistry, and even serious contemplation. This collection, compiled by one of our finest critics and anthologists, brings this tradition into the hands of today's readers, offering hours of delight.",

        "Description": "For more than forty years, Jack Germond has been covering politics for Gannett newspapers, the Washington Star, and the Baltimore Sun, and talking politics on the Today show, The McLaughlin Group, and Inside Washington. Now, in Fat Man Fed Up, Germond confronts the most critical issues raised by our election process and offers a scathing but wry polemic about what\u2019s wrong with American politics.Is there any connection between what happens in campaigns and what happens in government? And if not, where does the blame for the discontent lie? Was Tocqueville right? Do we get the leaders we deserve? Indeed, according to Germond, the politicians aren\u2019t the only ones to blame, or even the chief culprits. He describes how he and his colleagues in the news media have been guilty of dumbing-down the political process\u2013and how the voters are too apathetic to demand better coverage and better results. Instead, they simply turn away and too often end up enduring third-rate presidents.This no-sacred-cows manifesto faces the problems many are reluctant to address:\u2022 Polls and how they are used and abused by politicians and press to mislead gullible voters.\u2022 The critical failure of the press to accurately portray figures in the political realm, from Eugene McCarthy to Barbara Bush to Al Sharpton.\u2022 How the complaints about liberal bias in the press miss the real point: whether that bias, if it exists, colors the way editors and reporters work.\u2022 The staggering influence of television, and the networks\u2019 inability to provide anything but the most simplistic coverage of politics.\u2022 The \u201cbig lie\u201d school of campaigning. From \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d to \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d the politics of empty slogans has always placed noise above nuance: Say anything loudly enough and long enough, and voters are bound to mistake it for the truth.Along the way, Germond illustrates his arguments by drawing from his war chest of priceless anecdotes from decades in the business. With his inimitable combination of incisive journalism and sardonic and witty straight talk, Germond guides us through the fog created by candidates and the media. In this timely, outrageous, and compulsively readable book, no one is let off the hook. Fat Man Fed Up is a bracing look at how we never seem to get the truth about the people we\u2019re electing.",

Her father lived, but Blumenfeld's desire for revenge haunted her. This is her story. Traveling to Europe, America, and the Middle East, Blumenfeld gathers stories and methods of avengers worldwide as she plots to infiltrate the shooter's life. Through interviews with Yitzhak Rabin's assassin; with members of the Albanian Blood Feud Committee; the chief of the Iranian judiciary; the mayor of Palermo, Sicily; an Egyptian heroin smuggler; the Israeli prime minister and the military chief of staff; priests; sports fans; fifth-grade girls; and prostitutes, among others, she explores the mechanics and the psychology of vengeance.  But ultimately it is a journey that leads her back home -- where she is forced to confront her childhood dreams, her parents' failed marriage, and her ideas about family. In the end, her target turns out to be more complex -- and in some ways more threatening -- than the stereotypical terrorist she'd long imagined.  A rare, ambitious, personal, and intellectual tour of dark urges often denied, Revenge: A Story of Hope is a beautifully written story about family, loyalty, and home, about the personal passions behind public events, and about the thin line between love and hate.",

It captures their abiding ties to and deep affection for the Church and offers the wide-ranging, sometimes surprising views on the good things that come with being Catholic.This is not a book of theology.

The editor's introduction not only sets two decades of feminist anthropological work in the multiple contexts of changes in anthropological theory and practice, political and economic developments, and larger intellectual shifts, but also lays out the central insights feminist anthropology has to offer us in the postmodern era. The profound issues raised by the authors resonate with the basic interests of any discipline concerned with gender, that is, all of the social sciences and humanities.",

But what circumstances allowed Brandt to become the first left-wing chancellor in forty years? And why, given his progressive policies, did the East German secret police feel it necessary to plant a spy in his office and risk bringing down his government? Michael Frayn writes in his postscript to the play, \"Complexity is what the play is about: the complexity of human arrangements and of human beings themselves, and the difficulties that this creates in both shaping and understanding our actions.\"",

        "Authors": "By Williams, Dwight Arnan and Revell, Oliver",
        "Description": "From 1964 to 1994, Buck Revell directed or participated in virtually every major FBI investigation -- including the JFK assassination, Watergate, the Iran hostage crisis, and Gulf War antiterrorist operations. As the former Associate Deputy Director in charge of investigations, the Bureau's number-two career post, he sealed his reputation as a legendary maverick in federal law enforcement. Now, in a landmark autobiography, Revell candidly reveals the brilliance and deep-rooted flaws behind thirty years of FBI investigations.  Known early on for his street-smart, proactive, and hard-hitting style inside J. Edgar Hoover's Bureau, Revell hunted down Mafia hit men, Ku Klux Klan-type terrorist groups, and Eastern Bloc spies. Quickly rising in a system that was often its own worst enemy, he discloses why, after Hoover's death in 1972, he and other reform-minded agents moved to modernize the FBI both tactically and technologically -- and how he developed investigative strategies, innovated specific surveillance methods, and championed special FBI units, such as Special Events Management and Hostage Rescue.  As skilled at advising heads of state as collaring criminals, Revell was often summoned to the White House Situation Room. As the senior FBI representative to the National Security Council, he emerged as one of our leading authorities on terrorism and national security issues. He recounts how he persuaded Congress to enact Federal laws regarding fugitive apprehension abroad, and how he directed all international operations -- including tracking the kidnappers and killers of hostages in Beirut, international mafias weapons smuggling, and French and Japanese industrial espionage. He also demonstrates why it is vital for the FBI to become a global nerve center for the world's law enforcement agencies.  On the home front, Buck Revell continues to advise the National Security Council, the Pentagon, and the Justice Departments on matters of organized crime, drug enforcement, white-collar crime and terrorism. In A G-Man's Journal, he proposes drastic reforms for improving the current system of law enforcement and justice, and bluntly analyzes what went wrong at incidents like the Branch Davidian tragedy in Waco, and the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings.  A riveting chronicle of an extraordinary career amid history-shaping events, A G-Man's Journal lays bare the varied criminal threats facing America today, and sets the crimefighting agenda for the next century.",

He became a dissident, writing books (never officially published) that were invariably inspired by Czechoslovakia's repressive regime. But what happens to a rebel artist when there is nothing left to rebel against? This question indirectly informs Klima's powerful new novel - his most important and far-reaching fiction to date.Waiting for the Dark, Waiting for the Light describes life before, during, and after the Velvet Revolution of 1989. It is the story of Pavel, a middle-aged television cameraman working uneasily within the boundaries set by the regime, who dreams of one day making a film - a searing portrait of his times - that the authorities will never allow. But after the collapse of communism, Pavel finds he is unprepared for this new world of supposedly unlimited freedoms. He never quite gets around to making that searing portrait of his times; his time, his day, is taken up instead with lucrative small jobs - a TV spot, a commercial, a porn film ...Waiting for the Dark, Waiting for the Light is a masterful novel that focuses on the most pressing issue confronting the individual in the former Soviet bloc countries today: how to live one's life when one is truly free. Written with humor and compassion, it is powerful, provocative, and certain to further the reputation of Ivan Klima as a brilliant and original writer of international stature.",

In an age of shifty heroes with shaky values, he has created a hero who can still stand up for himself-and us.\" (The New York Times Book Review)  When fifty-one-year-old Nathan Smith, a once-confirmed bachelor, is found in his bed with a hole in his head made by a .38-caliber slug, it's hard not to imagine Nathan's young bride as the one with her finger on the trigger. Even her lawyer thinks she's guilty. But given that Mary Smith is entitled to the best defense she can afford-and thanks to Nathan's millions, she can afford plenty-Spenser hires on to investigate Mary's bona fides. Mary's alibi is a bit on the flimsy side: She claims she was watching television in the other room when the murder occurred. But the couple was seen fighting at a high-profile cocktail party earlier that evening, and the prosecution has a witness who says Mary once tried to hire him to kill Nathan. What's more, she's too pretty, too made-up, too blonde, and sleeps around-just the kind of person a jury loves to hate.  Spenser's up against a wall; leads go nowhere, no one knows a thing. Then a young woman, recently fired from her position at Smith's bank, turns up dead. Mary's vacant past suddenly starts looking meaner and darker-and Spenser's suddenly got to watch his back.  With lean, crackling dialogue, crisp action, and razor-sharp characters, Widow's Walk is another triumph.",

For thirty years we have lived with our internalized images of \"Jackie,\" but until now no writer has definitively explored what it feels like to exist in imaginative and heartfelt connection to this ubiquitous icon. In an elegiac gallery of fantasies and tableaux, Wayne Koestenbaum explains the late First Lady's mesmeric hold on America by anatomizing the myths and metaphors that have attached to her. Analyzing her iconography with both passion and precision, he places stories about Jackie - and photos of Jackie - within the context of literature, film, and the idiosyncratic imagination. Following her into America's dreamwork, far from pious \"family values,\" Wayne Koestenbaum dares to see her as an embodiment of pleasure, a figure of Circean extravagance, and a unique and necessary emblem of that most exhilarating of pursuits: freedom without responsibility.",

And it is also a book of uncompromising artistic integrity. They Whisper is an astonishingly rare thing in this sex-conscious age: a serious-work of literary art that directly and unflinchingly addresses the subject of modern heterosexuality.Butler's narrator is Ira Holloway, who as he moves into middle age is driven to examine his sexuality and its profound hold on him. Ira is, in many respects, an ordinary man: son of a steelworker, he is a husband and father; a Vietnam Vet, he works now as public relations man. But the details of Ira's quotidian life are of little real importance in his story. He lives - as so many men do - in an ongoing internal landscape populated by all the many women he has loved. And continues to love - instinctively, comprehensively, creatively, deeply. So deeply, in fact, that as he relives the moments of intimacy with them, Ira often speaks in the voices of these women. This weaving of the inner voices of both a man and the women he's loved creates a narrative driven by intuition and sensuality and free of theories and cant intellectualizing. The result is a compelling, profound, and timely examination of human sexuality and, not incidentally, one of the most rapturously erotic books of our time.",
