        "Authors": "By Redfield, James, Murphy, Michael, and Timbers, Sylvia",
        "Description": "It is no accident, argue James Redfield and Michael Murphy-the leading co-creators of today's spiritual boom-that the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have witnessed an explosion in human capacities. Daily we hear and read about supernormal athletic feats, clairvoyant perception, lives transformed by meditative practices, healing through prayer-and we ourselves experience these things. Many people's lives nowadays are marked by improved communication, a will to go beyond ego, synchronistic flow, and a sense of transcendent oneness and identity.  Indeed, the authors contend that thousands of years of human progress have delivered us to this very moment, in which each act of self-development is creating a new stage in planetary evolution-and the emergence of a human species possessed of vastly expanded personal abilities.  Written with the grace and ease of The Celestine Prophecy, God and the Evolving Universe features a broad range of exercises that readers can use to participate in everything they are reading about. Redfield's first major new work since 1999, God and the Evolving Universe is the only book to unite the personal and the planetary, and explain-like the proverbial butterfly that flaps its wings in China and causes a hurricane in New York-how each act of individual improvement and consciousness-raising, even as simple as lunchtime yoga, is part of a new evolutionary scheme.  This bold work heightens readers' awareness of their place in personal/planetary evolution and sets the stage for the new level in spiritual development.",

But these precious days would be in short supply - Jack's life was suddenly ended by a heart attack when Billy was just fifteen. 700 Sundays refers to the sadly precise amount of time shared by a devoted father and his adoring son.From the story of the Crystal family's proud connection to the New York jazz scene of the 40s and 50s ... to the hilarious living room performances that would sow the seeds of Billy's unparalleled career ... to the times of tragedy, heartbreak, and his mother's unending courage, 700 Sundays celebrates the memories, the love, and all the other wonderful gifts parents can give a child. It is not the story of Billy Crystal's great career. It is a tribute to a family and the people who helped make him a man.",

        "Description": "Catalyzed by a pre-Roe v. Wade abortion, which required the consent of the husband who left her and the approval of a hospital panel made up entirely of men, Kate Michelman - seasoned lobbyist, skilled political strategist, and inspiration to millions of women across the country - has since devoted her life to protecting the rights of women and children. As president of NARAL Pro-Choice America from 1985 to 2004, Michelman catapulted the organization to prominence as the nation's premier reproductive rights group, moving the question \"Who decides?\" to the mainstream, transforming the political debate, and defining a woman's freedom to choose as a fundamental American liberty.Now, in a book that is at once personally compelling and urgently relevant, Michelman offers a wake-up call to American women to defend their freedom in what is undoubtedly its hour of greatest danger: With the appointment of just one or two Supreme Court justices hostile to Roe v. Wade and the right to choose, Roe's protections may very well be lost, forcing women to live at the whim of politicians and affording them fewer reproductive rights than their mothers had thirty years ago.Politically impassioned, thought-provoking, and timely, With Liberty and Justice for All is not just a book about choice, but a book about freedom. It is a book about bringing children into a world under the best possible conditions, and about a woman's right to assume her equal place in American society.",

        "Authors": "By Caroli, Betty Boyd",
        "Description": "Today women dream of being president, yet in earlier generations women dreamed of being the president's wife. First Ladies tells the story of those women and of the evolution of their role from ceremonial backdrop to substantive world figure.      Covering all thirty-six women from Martha Washington to Nancy Reagan and including the daughters, daughters-in-law, and sisters of presidents who sometimes served as First Ladies, Betty Boyd Caroli explores the background, marriage, and accomplishments and failures in office of each woman. This remarkably diverse lot included Abigail Adams, whose \"remember the ladies\" became a twentieth-century feminist refrain; Edith Wilson, who alone controlled access to the President when he suffered a stroke; Jane Pierce, who prayed her husband would lose the election; Helen Taft, who insisted on living in the White House, although her husband would have preferred a judgeship; and Pat Nixon, who perfected what some have called \"the robot image.\"  They ranged in age from early 20's to late 60's; some received superb educations for their time, while others had little or no schooling. Including the courageous and adventurous, the emotionally unstable, the ambitious, and the reserved, these women often did not fit the traditional expectations of a presidential helpmate.      Depicting how these women used the \"magic wand\" given to them, Caroli reveals not only how each First Lady changed the role, but also how the role changed in response to American culture.  Because of their position, these women left remarkably complete records, and their stories offer us an insider's view not only of their lives as holders of what sociologists now call \"derivative power,\" but also of the history of American women in general.",

They are the ones with whom we can let down our guard and be ourselves.  In Why We are Friends, Gregory E. Lang celebrates the joys and blessings of friendship. Friends \"can have fun doing almost anything or just hanging out and doing nothing,\" he writes.   Sometimes we seek out friendship, other times it come to us unexpectedly. Either way, we are always the better for finding a true friend. Each is unique, and although one can never replace another, somehow we always seem to find room in our hearts for just one more. When you call another person \"friend,\" you pay him or her your highest compliment. Why We are Friends is a gift book that one friend can give to another to say, \"I value you, and I am thankful you're in my life. I hope I have been as good a friend to you as you have been to me.\"",

Her techniques are a brilliant blend of old-world common sense and the most contemporary research in brain chemistry, psychology, and mind-body studies. Loretta gives you dozens of proven techniques for recognizing the ten simple truths that will lead you to an intense, happy, successful life: resilience, living in the moment, optimism, acceptance, humor, creativity, moderation, responsibility, meaning, and connection.            Loretta\u2019s wisdom evolved from her own life\u2014one filled with the demands of being a single mother of three; of starting her own business when she was broke; and of the wacky invasiveness of her Italian family. She\u2019s like all of us: real, flawed, stressed out, and on edge. Her magic comes from an ability to not take herself too seriously, and to always shift her focus away from the self-destructive and toward the truly important things in life.            In her work, Loretta has seen tens of thousands of people who live their lives as if they\u2019re sitting in a waiting room, hoping that their turn comes up next. This book will show you that life is not something to be endured, but is something to be truly appreciated. We need to remember how to access our inner abundance, which allows us to be heart-centered, joy-filled human beings.

Combining a broad experience of all aspects of aerial warfare with a deep respect for and knowledge of Arab culture, Horner commanded the U.S. and allied air assets during Desert Shield and Desert Storm - the forces of a dozen nations - and was responsible for the design and execution of one of the most devastating air campaigns in history. Never before have the Gulf air war and its planning, a process filled with controversy and stormy personalities, been revealed in such detail.Beyond that, however, Every Man a Tiger is the story of two revolutions: of how a service damaged by Vietnam reinvented itself through vision, determination, and brutally hard work - in Horner's words, \"We had to learn how to be an Air Force all over again\" - and of how war changed fundamentally in the last decade of this century, not only in the new dominance of air power, but in all its aspects.",

But even before the phone lines are installed, McCone Investigations gets its first case - one that lifts Sharon off a roof in a helicopter and deposits her on a posh hideaway on the north California coast.Her new client is T.J. Gordon, a \"turnaround man\" - that rare breed of corporate troubleshooter who creates profits and enemies while reviving failing companies. Gordon owns more than the helicopter that whisks Sharon away... much more. And he's not really \"new.\" A friend from her radical student days in Berkeley, T.J. was a campus nomad with a lifestyle shadier than most. Now T.J. Gordon - grown ever more quirky, eccentric, and reclusive - is convinced someone is trying to kill him. He wants Sharon's help. Then he does another kind of turnaround: he vanishes.Hanging in the balance with T.J.'s life is his latest project, a visionary deal to revitalize an abandoned stretch of the San Francisco waterfront. His zigzag trail will lead Sharon both to Lost Hope, Nevada, a desert ghost town transformed into a booming tourist mecca with a mysterious long-buried corpse...and to Monora, a decaying Pennsylvania steel town where old resentments simmer beneath the grim shadow of empty mills. The clues are baffling and include a hermit in a hovel built of bottles and the saddened father of a missing union organizer. As the bizarre pieces of the puzzle start to fall into place, Sharon is desperate to find T.J. - headed toward his deadly confrontation with his California dreams.",

        "Authors": "By Coyle, Harold",
        "Description": "At the center of Harold Coyle's brilliant new novel is the dramatic court-martial of a courageous young woman combat officer, forced to choose - on the battlefield - between an action that will save her troops and the senseless order of an arrogant and frightened general.In Code of Honor, Harold Coyle - himself a former career Army officer - whose fast-paced novels of military action have made him a New York Times bestselling author, confronts the most sacred traditions of the Army's command structure to show what happens when one person - in this case a woman, in what was until recently a man's world - bucks the system.Captain Nancy Kozak's story is set against the decision to send U. S. troops to Colombia as \"peacekeeping\" force to prevent anarchy, a decision that leads to a vicious full-scale war in which the American forces, at first out-fought, battle desperately for survival - a scenario with disturbing echoes of the current controversies about putting U. S. forces into foreign countries....Coyle's cast of characters - familiar to readers of his previous books - includes not only Captain Kozak, but Brigadier General Scott Dixon and Lt. Colonel Harold Cerro - all of them plunged into a burgeoning guerrilla war in which the mistakes of Vietnam are about to be starkly repeated, over the objections of the officers on the spot.Pitted against each other are a number of antagonists as badly matched as any in the history of warfare - the pompous martinet commander of U. S. forces in Colombia, Major General C. B. Lane, whose MacArthur pose hides fear and incompetence, and Hector Valendez, the brilliantly gifted leader of the FARC, the Colombian left-wing guerrillas who are in the process of transforming themselves, under Valendez's leadership, into a real army that will frighten the pants off Lane and fight him to a standstill, as well as officers, soldiers, civilians and politicians on both sides, caught up in the tragic reality of war.As always, Harold Coyle's descriptions of battle are alarmingly authentic, but in Code of Honor he has reached a new level of excitement. In hard-edged muscular prose and action, he takes the reader into the very heart of battle, and at the same time brings into the foreground nancy Kozak, who personifies the problems of a young woman, in love and sometimes confused about her own emotions, commanding troops in combat - and in the best sense of its kind since The Caine Mutiny - finds herself facing a court-martial despite her heroism and leadership.",

The hideous, crablike Modibo, a self-interested poacher, is on his trail, determined to kill Ken and prevent him from uncovering the mystery behind the boy's existence. Modibo joins forces with Cyril Anderson, a headline-grabbing, world-famous anthropologist, who has been years without a significant \"find.\" He will do anything to steal Ken's discovery. Anderson touches off a high-powered conspiracy to pierce the secret of the savanna.To escape, the boy leads Ken into the forest and introduces him to a hidden tribe of proto-humans. Ken quickly becomes a part of them, letting go of his modern self and forming a link with these beings so very like his own ancestors.",

        "Description": "Unflinchingly honest and powerfully insightful, Olivia Goldsmith captures the true essence of today's woman as few writers can. And she's funny while doing it. \"Olivia Goldsmith's forte has always been the writing of revenge novels with great, good humor,\" Washington Post Book World wrote, praising her talents, and Newsweek proclaimed she is \"like Jane Austen dealing blackjack... you keep licking your fingers and reaching for the next page as if it was another potato chip.\" Now the acclaimed author of the phenomenal New York Times bestseller The First Wives Club returns with her most powerful and moving novel yet, the contemporary story of three young women's initial illusions, desperate reality, and clever responses to their dirty rotten husbands.Meet the Young Wives: Angela, Michelle, and Jada, thirty-something women who appear to have lives as delicious as dessert. A typical New Yorker, half-Jewish, half-Italina, Angela is a lawyer married to Reid, a handsome old-money WASP. Michelle, a traditionalist at heart, adors her childhood sweetheart husband, Frank, and the dream house he's provided for her and their two beautiful children. Married to Clinton, Jada is a suburban African American wife working hard to maintain a happy home despite her husband's failing business. She's determined to give her family the privileges she never had.But then, like a bad souffle, the lives of Angela, Michelle, and Jada separately collapse as they each discover lies embedded in their marriages. Betrayed, their love and trust crushed, their families virtually destroyed, they unite for solace and support. While their nefarious husbands have won the first battle, the war has only just began. Sharing their misery and their dreams, they draw on one another's friendship and strength to heal their wounds--and reconstruct their lives. Bowed but not beaten, this smart, audacious trio concocts a brilliant recipe to take back what's theirs and render justice on their duplicitous men--and transform them from victims to victors...The perfect anti-Valentine's Day story, Young Wives is an addictively funny novel with an edge. Nobody understands \"female problems\" as well as Olivia Goldsmith, and here she is at her smart and satisfying best.",

How could anything be wrong?\" Molly Jong-Fast's Normal Girl is striking-and as funny as it as real. Inspired by her own experiences growing up in the decadent, fast-paced netherworld of New York City's jet set, Jong-Fast's debut novel is a hilarious, hard-edged walk past the velvet rope.At just nineteen, Miranda Woke seems to have it all. Her parents are famous socialites, she's already been written up on Page Six sixteen times, she's on all the right invitation lists, and drugs and alcohol are never in short supply. But while her image screams \"It girl,\" she'd rather be a normal girl, and the A-list feels even more uncomfortable than her Manolo Blahnik shoes. In fact, she's become the \"living embodiment of an awkward phase\" with \"more issues than Harper's Bazaar.\" Neither Xanax nor Deepak Chopra tapes help. And now that her junkie party has trashed her parents' house, she has to liquidate her trust fund to pay Mom's decorator for a quick fix. But worst of all, Miranda thinks she just murdered her own boyfriend.In an all-too-glamorous world where the cell phone is always ringing, Miranda sees no escape other than a downward spiral of cocaine, Valium, and heroin. It takes friends who offer more than air kisses to force Miranda to look in the mirror and get some help.",

Their potential is unlimited, but they are content to live within the closed world of New York City's Hell's Kitchen. And to play as many pranks as they can on the denizens of the street. They never get caught. And they know they never will.Until one disastrous summer afternoon.On that day, what begins as a harmless scheme goes horribly wrong. And the four find themselves facing a year's imprisonment in the Wilkinson Home for Boys. The oldest of them is fifteen, the youngest twelve. What happens to them over the course of that year - brutal beatings, unimaginable humiliation - will change their lives forever.Years later, one has become a lawyer. One a reporter. And two have grown up to be murderers, professional hitmen. For all of them, the pain and fear of Wilkinson still rages within. Only one thing can erase it.Revenge.To exact it, they will twist the legal system. Commandeer the courtroom for their agenda. Use the wiles they observed on the streets, the violence they learned at Wilkinson.If they get caught this time, they only have one thing left to lose: their lives.",

        "Description": "A Civil War is bestselling sportswriter John Feinstein's account of one extraordinary year in Army and Navy football, the breathtaking 1995 campaign. Feinstein followed both teams through the year, attending their practices and classes, relaxing with them in their limited free time, standing with them on the sideline at their games. For Navy, it was a must-win year. The Cadets had beaten the Midshipmen three years straight, each time in heartbreaking fashion, and for the entire senior class the Army game would be a last chance for redemption. Army had its own troubles: a beloved coach was in danger of losing his job and the team leaders were determined to finish their careers with a winning season and a bowl game invitation. A Civil War traces the ups and downs of both teams through the season, showing how these remarkable young men dealt with the rigors of football along with the constant pressure of academy life, while re-creating the intense weeks leading up to the showdown. The account here of the 1995 Army-Navy game is an unforgettable piece of sportswriting, an up-close retelling of a heart-stopping game from both sides of the field.",

        "Description": "The time is the near future...The Intifada, the Palestinian revolt, intensifies throughout the West Bank and Gaza. Egypt breaks diplomatic relations with Israel. The combined air forces of Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Egypt invade the skies over Israel. The sixth Arab-Israeli war has begun...South Korean student protesters, marching to the demilitarized zone separating their country from North Korea, are fired on by South Korean security forces, resulting in nearly 1,000 casualties and worldwide cries of protest. Wildly escalating tensions culminate in air and artillery strikes by North Korea against the South that launch, in turn, the second Korean War...The revolutionary Sandinista Front regains power in Nicaragua in a bloodless coup. With a renewed offensive by FMLN guerrillas in neighboring El Salvador, the Sandinistas establish a supporting land supply link to the rebels by mounting an offensive into Honduras. Once again, Central America is engulfed in war...Russia's controversial prime minister is assassinated as he addresses a special session of parliament. A resurgent KGB takes power and declares martial law. Mutinies erupt in army and air force units across the country ushering in the second Russian Revolution...Today we witness a harsh paradox: after the long-hoped-for end of the Cold War, concern for world security has, if anything, dramatically increased. Now, in Future Wars, Col. Trevor N. Dupuy one of America's foremost military analysts, examines ten world hotspots where war might break out in the next five years.With the assistance of a unique analytical tool developed by the author, a computerized combat simulation used in several defense ministries around the world, Future Wars examines the following possible global flashpoints, the third Gulf War, the fourth India-Pakistan War, the Sandinista War, the war for Transylvania, the Libya-Egypt War, the second Korean War, the second war for Africa, the sixth Arab-Israeli War, the Russian Civil War and the Sino-Russian border war.Written with the authority of a top-ranked military analyst and the you-are-there immediacy of the best techno-thriller fiction, Future Wars gives a brief history of the region for each of these wars and describes its probable course - including a review of each side's military potential, a vividly detailed scenario of a typical engagement, and a prediction of what the outcome most likely would be.An educated speculation about what could happen and how, Future Wars may well prove to be one of the most important books for the uncertain and perilous years that lie ahead.",

        "Authors": "By Forsyth, Frederick",
        "Description": "Only Frederick Forsyth, acknowledged master of international intrigue and suspense, could have created the one story about the Persian Gulf War that could never be revealed - until now.From the behind-the-scenes decision-making of the Allies to the secret meetings of Saddam Hussein's war cabinet, from the brave American fliers running their dangerous missions over Iraq to the heroic young spy planted deep in the heart of Baghdad, Forsyth's incomparable storytelling skill keeps the suspense at a breakneck pace.Unless the Allies can penetrate the Iraqi regime, they fear they will be sending the vast coalition of air and land forces they have mobilized after the invasion of Kuwait into a bloody desert Armageddon. Then word leaks out to British intelligence that Israel's Mossad had once run a mole in Iraq itself - someone in the highest levels of Saddam's government whose identity even the Mossad had never been able to discover. This is the mysterious \"Jericho,\" and into Baghdad, under the very eyes of Iraq's fearsome secret police, goes Major Mike Martin of Britain's elite Special Air Service Regiment, disguised as an Arab and determined to reestablish the connection with Jericho.It is a most dangerous game. Moreover, while Jericho can convey - for a price - inside information about what is going on in the high councils of the Iraqi dictator, Saddam has kept his ultimate weapon secret even from his most trusted advisers. The nightmare scenario that haunts General Schwarzkopf and his colleagues is suddenly imminent unless, somehow, Mike Martin can locate that weapon in time.Peopled with vivid characters, brilliantly displaying the intricacies of intelligence operations, both electronic and human, moving back and forth between Washington and London, Baghdad and Kuwait, desert vastnesses and city bazaars, revealing espionage tradecraft as only Frederick Forsyth can, The Fist of God is a breathtaking novel that tells the utterly convincing story of what may actually have happened behind the headlines.",

Cloned children have had children of their own, and  their eyes are raised toward the giant planet in the sky which long ago was the cradle of humanity. Finally, after millennia of waiting, the descendants of the original refugees travel back to a planet they've never known, to try and rebuild a civilization of which they've never been a part. The fate of the earth lies in the success of their return, but after so much time, the question is not whether they can rebuild an old destroyed home, but whether they can learn to inhabit an alien new world--Earth.",

Jason Archer is a rising young executive at Triton Global, the world's leading technology conglomerate. Determined to give his family the best of everything, Archer has secretly entered into a deadly game of cat and mouse. He is about to disappear - leaving behind a wife who must sort out his lies from his truths, an aircrash investigation team that wants to know why the plane he was ticketed on suddenly fell from the sky, and a veteran FBI agent who wants to know it all.

        "Title": "Ambling Into History: The Unlikely Odyssey of George W. Bush",
        "Authors": "By Bruni, Frank",
        "Description": "In many ways George W. Bush did not seem built for the presidency or the paces necessary to win it. He was a laid-back good-time guy with little appetite and limited talent for formal oratory, someone who often projected affability more easily than authority. He was a homebody who seemed to prefer surroundings and situations that were utterly familiar to those that were risky and unpredictable. His interests could be narrow and his efforts to expand them only fitful.But he got there, and after September 11, 2001, confronted a challenge more daunting than many of his predecessors had faced. In the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Bush was left with the responsibility to lead Americans through a time of unusual anxiety and uncertainty, to inspire and reassure them. Could he do it?In Ambling Into History, Frank Bruni, who covered Bush's presidential campaign and first eight months in the White House for the New York Times, mines the countless hours during which he observed and interacted with Bush to explore that question,  and to present sides of Bush that readers have never encountered. He looks to small moments for big truths, going behind the scenes and offering fresh insights into Bush's oft-chronicled weaknesses, sometimes overlooked strengths, and his journey-alternately earnest and reluctant-from an innate levity to a newfound gravity.Bruni also takes readers on his own trip through the strange maze of presidential politics, wryly chronicling life in the insular \"bubble\" of political reporting and its frequently dispiriting effect on the coverage that politicians get. It is a candid, eloquent, and illuminating adventure that shows why Newsweek called Bruni \"probably the most influential\" reporter on the Bush beat.",

With clear and simple guidance, Bash shows you how to interpret their unmistakable vocabulary, including:   Facial expression: reading a dog's emotions, state of health, and intentions by watching for signs like narrowing of the eyes or wrinkling of the muzzle Body language: learning the meaning of body stances and tail positions, including the \"I'm top dog around here, don't mess with me\" and \"I'm feeling low\" poses Vocalization: understanding why dogs bark, how to satisfy their needs, and how to prevent problem barking   Filled with Bash's inimitable warmth and humor, as well as fascinating facts about man's best friend, DogSpeak turns dog training into a game that both you and your dog will enjoy.",

        "Description": "In her customary crystalline prose Harriet Doerr examines the lives of four North American expatriates in a small Mexican village of a thousand souls. Set on the barren mesa of Amapolas, we see the newcomers settling in their adobe houses and gradually adjusting to an environment of excesses - hot sun, torrential downpour, sweeping landscapes, and a vastness of untouched nature - and watch as each is drawn into the aura of this land and changed.For young, recently divorced Sue Ames - artist and part owner of the land in Amapolas - this countryside of wet earth and jasmine, animal dung and charcoal fire, as well as the inhabitants, enable her to see her own life more clearly. But for her partner, Bud Loomis, ambitious investor, fleeing tax evasion charges in Arizona, Amapolas is a chance to escape. Then there is Frances Bowles, for whom this new, exotic place is a constant enigma that is at once simplistically seductive and eternally elusive; in planning to create a new future for herself, she succeeds in an unexpected way. For her mother, Ursula Bowles, seventy-nine and widowed, the land is critical. Born in Mexico, she returns not only because of her love for the place and its people but to connect - as best she can - the end of her life with its beginning. All their experiences are brought vividly to life as they interact with the Mexicans, who observe the Americans with a curious mixture of fascination and tolerance.With an unfailingly true ear, eye, and voice, Harriet Doerr's story unfolds clearly and beautifully, equally accurate in its observations of the American, the Mexicans, and the landscape that contains them.",
