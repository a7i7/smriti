        "Authors": "By Sproul, R. C.",
        "Description": "Too often in today's age of secularism we fail to see God's hand in both the rewards and the trials of our lives. Because He is invisible to us, we erroneously think that many events happen by coincidence; we don't sense God's active presence in the course of human affairs. With these blinders in place, we look at the world's past, present, and future and speculate, \"What if...?\"But, as R. C. Sproul convincingly writes in The Invisible Hand, \"There is no 'what if?' in God.\" He doesn't roll dice! Nor does He have to wait to see which fork in the road we choose.... He knows the future precisely because He wills the future as He did the past. \"He is a God whose providence is in the details.\"Examining the perplexing question of God's providence, this talented author and teacher points to God's intimate involvement in every aspect of life on earth. R. C. Sproul writes, not just from a doctrinal viewpoint, but through the concrete experiences of flesh-and-blood people, including those whose lives and struggles are recorded in Scripture. In doing so, he proves the cardinal point of the doctrine of providence: God is for us. Then he follows with the apostle Paul's empowering question, \"If God is for us, who can be against us?\"When we know and accept God's providence we can face life with courage and perseverance, even when things occur that bring pain, sorrow and affliction into our lives. God's providence is our fortress, our shield, our eternal reward, because the God who moves the heavens is also the God who lovingly guides the most intimate details of our lives.",

Within a few short years, Jacqueline Kennedy's natural elegance and taste would completely transform how the White House - and America - entertained. With French cuisine in the State Dining Room and Pablo Casals playing in the East Room, Jackie created some of the most memorable occasions in White House history and set a standard for hospitality that the whole country would emulate.Now Letitia Baldrige and White House chef Rene Verdon have collaborated to recreate some of the most famous evenings of that storied era. Through Letitia Baldrige's intimate, behind-the-scenes recollections, complemented by seldom-seen photographs and memorabilia, these glittering parties are brought to life once again. And with five original menus and over thirty-five authentic recipes by Rene Verdon, carefully adapted and tested for modern kitchens, everyone can now experience some of the atmosphere of those magical evenings inspired by Jacqueline Kennedy.",

Now, in Hallelujah Junction, he incisively relates his life story, from his childhood to his early studies in classical composition amid the musical and social ferment of the 1960s, from his landmark minimalist innovations to his controversial \"docu-operas.\" Adams offers a no-holds-barred portrait of the rich musical scene of 1970s California, and of his contemporaries and colleagues, including John Cage, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass. He describes the process of writing, rehearsing, and performing his renowned works, as well as both the pleasures and the challenges of writing serious music in a country and a time largely preoccupied with pop culture.Hallelujah Junction is a thoughtful and original memoir that will appeal to both longtime Adams fans and newcomers to contemporary music. Not since Leonard Bernstein's Findings has an eminent composer so candidly and accessibly explored his life and work. This searching self-portrait offers not only a glimpse into the work and world of one of our leading artists, but also an intimate look at one of the most exciting chapters in contemporary culture.",

        "Title": "Flower Children",
        "Authors": "By Swann, Maxine",
        "Description": "From an award-winning writer: an elegant, lively, moving novel that portrays the strangely celebrated and unsupervised childhood of four hippie offspring in the seventies and eighties.  When Flower Children's first chapter was published as a short story in 1997, it announced the arrival of a new literary voice: it won every literary prize applicable (the Ploughshares' Cohen Award, the O. Henry Award, and the Pushcart Prize) and was included in the 1998 Best American Short Stories. Now, Maxine Swann expands and continues that story, bringing its four sibling characters through to the other end of childhood, in a much-anticipated book that only Swann could write.  Based on the author's own family, Flower Children is the amusing, moving, beautifully painted story of four children growing up in rural Pennsylvania, the offspring of devoutly hippie parents. Impossibly at odds with their surroundings, the children find themselves both delighted and unnerved by a life without limits. A swing hangs in the middle of the living room. The children run free all day, dance naked in the rain, and go riding on ponies with the boys who live up the road. But as their childhood is celebrated, the freedoms their parents have given them have also compromised their innocence. In time, their world starts to collapse. The parents split. Puberty hits. The children are mortified by what they know and have seen. They long for structure, normalcy, restraint: the very things their parents have avoided.  Haunting and celebratory by turns, Flower Children is at once a portrait of childhood's unbridled joy and the story of a unique generation. Ann Patchett recently selected another excerpt of the novel to appear in the 2006 Best American Short Stories.",

At least, that's what the doctors told him when he woke up in intensive care. It had been a freak accident, they said. A school bus suddenly turned in front of his red convertible, smashing it to bits. By all odds, that should have been it. John's injuries had been grave. His heart had stopped and been restarted. He'd flatlined. His brain showed no signs of activity. Only sheer stubbornness kept the doctors from pulling the plug. Then, days later, he suddenly, mysteriously woke up - confused, in pain, but very much alive.At first, he didn't remember much of what had happened. But then, the dreams began ...The accident itself, in vivid, second-by-second detail. The face of the woman who had been driving the bus - a face twisted with pure hatred. The long hours in the trauma center, as he hovered over his own shattered body, watching the doctors desperately laboring to bring him back.And the light - a faint but steadily growing glow at the end of a swirling vortex. A brilliant incandescence filled with joy, love, peace that beckoned him closer...But there were other dreams as well...A frightened, heartbroken boy from a desperately troubled family running for his life. A pretty, red-haired woman whose life was crashing around her, tempted to end it all. An embittered, broken man whose heart smoldered with despair, hatred, and murderous rage.These lives were somehow intertwined with his own, in a way he did not fully understand.With the visions, John Creed received a remarkable gift. He could share the pain of other souls, take their suffering and transform it into peace. But this same gift also opened him to darker forces. Forces which could shift the balance between good and evil for ages to come....Exciting, suspenseful, moving, and inspirational PARTING THE VEIL is a powerful testament to faith, hope, and the triumphant human spirit.",

        "Description": "Leonardo da Vinci was one of history's true geniuses, equally brilliant as an artist, scientist, and mathematician. Readers of The Da Vinci Code were given a glimpse of the mysterious connections between math, science, and Leonardo's art. Math and the Mona Lisa picks up where The Da Vinci Code left off, illuminating Leonardo's life and work to uncover connections that, until now, have been known only to scholars.   B\u00fclent Atalay, a distinguished scientist and artist, examines the science and mathematics that underlie Leonardo's work, paying special attention to the proportions, patterns, shapes, and symmetries that scientists and mathematicians have also identified in nature. Following Leonardo's own unique model, Atalay searches for the internal dynamics of art and science, revealing to us the deep unity of the two cultures. He provides a broad overview of the development of science from the dawn of civilization to today's quantum mechanics. From this base of information, Atalay offers a fascinating view into Leonardo's restless intellect and modus operandi, allowing us to see the source of his ideas and to appreciate his art from a new perspective.",

To him, laws are for enforcing and visions must be followed--even if that means freeing a beautiful slave and making her his reluctant handmaiden. Betrayed once before, Magnus can barely bring himself to trust another woman. Yet Daenaira's fiery innocence is drawing them both into a reckless inferno of desire.  Daenaira grew up hearing tales of a fearsome priest who seemed more myth than reality. But Magnus is very real--every inch of him--and so is the treachery surrounding them. Beneath Sanctuary's calm surface, an enemy is scheming to unleash havoc on the Shadowdwellers, unless Magnus trusts in a union ordained by fate, and sealed by unending bliss.  .  .",

        "Title": "Profiting from Uncertainty: Strategies for Succeeding No Matter What the Future Brings",
        "Authors": "By Gunther, Robert E. and Schoemaker, Paul J. H.",
        "Description": "What manager is not anxious about the future? We live in a white-knuckled age of rapid technological change and global instability. But uncertainty is not the enemy, says management expert Paul J. H. Schoemaker. It is where the greatest opportunities are. To unlock these opportunities, however, requires a very different approach to strategy and implementation. In this pioneering book, Dr. Schoemaker presents a systematic approach that combines concepts such as scenario planning, options thinking, and dynamic monitoring to create novel strategies for profiting from ambiguity. Building on his experience with more than one hundred consulting projects in fields ranging from health care to manufacturing, from utilities to financial services, Schoemaker shows how major corporations throughout the world have used his pathbreaking methodology to prepare for an uncertain future and profit from it. In this first comprehensive approach to the subject, Schoemaker shows the reader (1) how to develop and analyze multiple industry scenarios, (2) craft nimble strategies with just the right amount of flexibility, (3) implement them using an options approach, and (4) make real-time adjustments through dynamic monitoring. As a leading academic thinker and practitioner, the author draws on the frontiers of decision science, organization theory, strategy, and cognitive psychology to integrate the most practical contributions these various fields have made to navigating uncertainty. More than any other capability, skill in seizing initiatives in shifting, unpredictable circumstances is the key to success. Profiting from Uncertainty provides a road map to do just that. This book was first published in 2002, well ahead of the mega turmoil that befell the world in 2008 and beyond. The methods and tools described here have been used by many companies and are even more relevant today than when originally published. You can\u2019t do without them.",
