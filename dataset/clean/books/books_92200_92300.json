His voice is plainspoken but moody, humorous and edgy, and ever surprising.These are philosophical poems that ask questions about language and intention, about the sometimes untidy connections between the human and natural worlds. In the poem \"Terminal Lake,\" Lux undermines notions of benign nature, finding dark currents beneath the surface: \"it's a huge black coin, / it's as if the real lake is drained / and this lake is the drain: gaping, language- / less, suck- and sinkhole.\" In the ominous \"Render, Render,\" the narrator asks us to consider a concentration of the essences of our lives: all that is physical, spiritual, remembered, and dreamed for, melded together to make the messy self we present to the world.Lux's voice is intelligent without being bookish, urgent and unrelentingly evocative. He has long been a strong advocate for the relevance of poetry in American culture. The Los Angeles Times praises Lux for his \"compelling rhythms, his biting irony, and his steady devotion to a craft that often seems thankless.\" As Sven Birkerts noted, \"Lux may be one of the poets on whom the future of the genre depends.\"",

A man of enormous energy but plagued by ill health, an admirer of the parliamentary system whose contentious relationship with Congress led to the crushing defeat of his cherished League of Nations, Wilson remains a fascinating enigma. We will always be left to ponder the extent to which his character shaped our century's history.This study sheds new light on Wilson's upbringing and career, from the grim determination that enabled him to overcome dyslexia to his skillful dance of isolationism and intervention in World War I. From the dynamic figure whose ringing speeches hypnotized vast crowds, to the gentle voice reading poetry to his children, to the rising academic and president of Princeton who made the giant leap into politics.",

He examines the UN's Declaration on the Right to Development, its historical and legal contexts and flaws, and other human rights instruments such as the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenants on Human Rights. He examines concepts of core rights, positive rights and liberty, rights holders, and economic needs and rights. He discusses how the right to development relates to developing countries' poverty reduction strategies, the Millennium Development Goals, and the official development assistance of developed countries. He then describes a policy framework that is aimed at low-income countries and stagnant economies. Chauffour, who has worked with international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, is an economic advisor in the World Bank's International Trade Department.

        "Title": "Why Mars and Venus Collide: Improving Relationships by Understanding How Men and Women Cope Differently with Stress",
        "Authors": "By Gray, John",
        "Description": "Once upon a time, Martians and Venusians functioned in separate worlds. But in today's hectic and career-oriented environment, relationships have become a lot more complicated, and men and women are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress. To add to the increasing tension, most men and women are also completely unaware that they are actually hardwired to react differently to the stress. It's a common scenario: a husband returns home from work stressed out and eager to kick back on the couch and watch television. A wife returns home from work stressed out and wants to talk about it with her husband. What happens? Neither is on the same page, anger and resentment set in, and Mars and Venus collide. Using his signature insight that has helped millions of couples transform their relationships, John Gray once again arms the inhabitants of Mars and Venus with information that will help them live harmoniously ever after. In Why Mars and Venus Collide, Gray focuses on the ways that men and women misinterpret and mismanage the stress in their daily lives, and how these reactions ultimately affect their relationships. \"It's not that he's just not into you; he needs to fulfill a biological need,\" Gray explains. \"And it's not that she wants to henpeck you; she also has a biological drive.\" He shows, for instance, how a husband's withdrawal is actually a natural way for him to replenish his depleted testosterone levels and restore his well-being, and how a woman's need for conversation and support helps her build her own stress-reducing hormone, oxytocin.Backed up by groundbreaking scientific research, Gray offers a clear, easy-to-understand program to bridge the gap between the two planets, providing effective communication strategies that will actually lower stress levels. Whether in a relationship or single, this book will help both men and women understand their new roles in a modern, work-oriented society, and allow them to discover a variety of new and practical ways to create a lifetime of love and harmony.",
