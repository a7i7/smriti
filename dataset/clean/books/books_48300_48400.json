It is his first official investigation. Obscure clues lead him up and down the streets of Florence, following a trail full of intrigue and mystery. Why have seven scholars, each a master of his art, assembled in the city? What was the secret that might have been revealed had the artist lived to complete his work? Was it an alchemist\u2019s formula to transform lead into gold? Did it have to do with Antilia, wild and beautiful, who dances nightly in a tavern owned by a one-armed crusader? Or perhaps with another elusive Beatrice, the heiress to the imperial Swabian throne, whose rumored arrival in the city could upset the political aspirations of Pope Boniface, Dante\u2019s nemesis? \u00a0Leoni\u2019s voice is wry and irreverent as he pokes fun at the genius poet and renders Dante a human being\u2014brilliant but temperamental, bumbling but undaunted.

Yael Weiss, an eighteen-year-old from St. Louis, reinvents herself as the twenty-five-year-old Methodist Yale White when she travels to Paris with the YMCA to work in a soldiers\u2019 canteen. Dub Hagopian\u2013the doughboy she has a carried a torch for all the way across the Atlantic\u2013is at once the patriotic child of immigrants from Rhode Island and, covertly, a member of Erinyes, an organization dedicated to avenging the Armenian massacres of 1915.    In her jaunty, engaging style, Mitchell captures the atmosphere of political carnival surrounding the Paris Peace Conference, where Yale, Dub, and their crowd gather, bursting with both the passionate ideals and the devil-may-care energy of youth. When they decamp to a ch\u00e2teau outside Paris, where Erinyes is hatching a radical plan and Armenian war orphans are billeted, Yale and Dub will face the largest decisions of their young lives.   A beautiful love story, The Last Day of the War is also a tragicomic farce about the workings of history and a testament to the moral fortitude of men and women swept up in the tide of their extraordinary times.",

The subterfuge was ended off the shores of Madeira, as the ship was rechristened and outfitted for war. With new gun ports cut to accommodate additional cannon, the CSS Shenandoah commenced the last, most quixotic sea story of the Civil War, the 58,000-mile, around-the-world cruise of the Confederacy\u2019s second most successful merchant raider. Before its voyage was over, thirty- four Union merchant and whaling ships and their cargoes would be sunk. But it was after ship and crew had rounded Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope, stopped long enough in Australia to cause a diplomatic crisis, and navigated the ice floes of Siberia\u2019s Sea of Okhotsk, the Bering Sea, and the Arctic Ocean that their journey took its most fearful turn.Four months after the Civil War was over, the Shenandoah\u2019s Captain Waddell finally learned he was, and had been, fighting without cause or state. In the eyes of the Union, he had gone from being an enemy combatant to a pirate, a hangable offense. Hunted by Union and British men-of-war, his polyglot crew rife with hints of mutiny, and with dwindling supplies, Waddell elected to camouflage the ship, circumnavigate the globe, and attempt to surrender on English soil. Assembled from hundreds of original documents, including intimate shipboard journals kept by Shenandoah officers, Sea of Gray is a masterful narrative of men at sea.",

        "Title": "The United States of Europe: The New Superpower and the End of American Supremacy",
        "Authors": "By Reid, T. R.",
        "Description": "In May 2004, the European Union will add ten new member states-including Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, among others-to become a union of twenty-five nations. While this might seem a fairly innocuous and minute shift of political semantics for most Americans, the enlargement will increase the population of the EU to 450 million citizens, making it larger (in population) and richer (in GDP) than the United States-not to mention that the EU has more trade than the United States and more votes on the UN Security Council and all other international organizations. This New Europe is determined to flex its political and economic muscle on the world stage. The Continent has moved much further than most Americans realize toward the dream of a \"United States of Europe,\" to borrow Winston Churchill's term.  T. R. Reid's The United States of Europe lays bare the ways in which the EU is positioning itself to be a global counterweight and second superpower, on equal footing with the U.S.A. Reid traces the rise of the EU from the days when Churchill and other visionaries set out in the post-World War II rubble to find a means to end war in Europe. He shows how this remarkably successful effort to \"create peace\" also created a global economic and political power that is often at odds with the United States. This drive toward unity has been accelerated by the powerful mood of anti-Americanism (or, at least, anti-Bushism) that has swept the Continent since the war in Iraq.  In addition to the political ramifications of the EU, The United States of Europe shows the great impact this alliance is having on the global economic market. The euro, which now has more daily users than the dollar, is fast becoming a reserve currency and a new standard for global finance, a globally recognized replacement for the once-almighty dollar. Unification has spawned a generation of European corporate managers who have led firms like Nokia, Airbus, BP, Vodafone, and Red Bull to catch and surpass their U.S. competitors in global markets.  The European Union, from its beginnings as an experiment in statecraft, has rapidly emerged as a resounding success; yet Americans have so far managed to ignore the geopolitical revolution under way across the Atlantic. Reid's book shows how quietly-and not so quietly-Europe is developing itself into an economic, political, and cultural powerhouse.",

Now, in his first cookbook, Ming shares the technique and philosophy behind his exciting cross-cultural fare.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The key, Ming explains, is retaining a healthy respect for the traditions of each cuisine so that diverse elements can be combined in a harmonious way. His trademark Foie Gras and Morel Shu Mai, for example, elevates a traditional yet simple Asian preparation with a luxuriously sophisticated Western ingredient and transforms a humble dish into truly elegant fare. Prosciutto and Asian Pear Maki is a playful reinterpretation of a Japanese favorite, while Classic Roast Chicken with Sticky Rice Stuffing gives the holiday staple a savory new spin. The result is food that's inventive yet not trendy, complex in flavor but surprisingly easy to prepare.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In chapters devoted to Soups; Dim Sum (irresistible starters and bite-sized party fare); Rice and Noodles; Seafood; Birds; Meat; Sides; Oils, Dips and Seasonings; and Desserts, Ming proves again and again how delicious the coming together of East and West can be: Gingered Beef with Leeks and Asparagus, Hoisin-Marinated Chicken with Napa Slaw, Asian Gazpacho with Cilantro-Jicama Cream, and Wok-Flashed Salt and Pepper Shrimp are all quick and straightforward preparations that provide big flavors in every bite. And when it's time to pull out all the stops, a chapter dedicated to Over-the-Top recipes will guide home cooks through an array of showstopping dishes that dazzle with innovative techniques and presentations. Beverage suggestions accompany each recipe to complete the dining experience. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filled with Ming's tips for working with unfamiliar ingredients and preparations, Blue Ginger is an outstanding introduction to the pleasures of East-West cooking.",

Whether we are reading about civil war in Algeria or  Afghanistan, the struggle for the soul of Turkey, or political  turmoil in Pakistan or Malaysia, the Islamic context permeates  all these situations. Yet who really understands the central  tenets of this faith, or why so many people around the world have  turned to \u00e6fundamentalism\u00c6? Karen Armstrong\u00c6s elegant and concise  book traces how Islam grew from the other religions of the book,  Judaism and Christianity; introduces us to the character of  Muhammed; and demonstrates that for much of its history, the  religion has been a force for enlightenment that promoted  liberties for women and allowed the arts and sciences to  flourish. Islam shows how this progressive legacy is today often  set aside as the faith struggles to come to terms with the  economic and political weakness of most of its believers and with  the forces of modernity itself.",

Women in the Old Testament introduces readers to some biblical women. Here, readers meet mothers and wives, queens and slaves, prophets and warriors, powerful women and victims; women whose stories offer us courage and insight. In Women in the Old Testament Sister Irene explores not only the lives of such well-known women as Sarah, Deborah, Ruth, Eve, and Naomi, but also those of lesser-known women such as Michal, Tamar, and Jezebel. Each of these women has unique characteristics; each of their stories is food for our imaginations. In addition, Sister Nowell looks at those Bible stories that tell us what it means to be a woman created in the image of God and that portray God in the image of a woman. Biblical stories help us imagine the relationship of God with human beings, and they give us words to describe our own relationship with God. This introduction to the lives of biblical women encourages readers - in adult study groups and those who are interested in the many women in the Old Testament - to search for more accounts of biblical women and also to find the narrative of faith reflected in the stories of their own lives. Sister Irene begins each chapter with suggestions for readings and includes biblical excerpts. Chapters are: Women of Israel's Beginnings: Sarah and Hagar;\" \"More Women of Israel's Beginnings: Rebekah, Leah and Rachel, The Maids, Dinah, Tamar;\" \"Women of Israel's Passover: The Midwives, Moses' Mother, Pharaoh's Daughter, Miriam, Zipporah;\" \"Women of Israel's Early Tribes: Rahab, Deborah and Jail, Jephthah's Daughter, Samson's Mother, Samson's Wife, Delilah;\" \"More Women of Israel's Early Tribes: Ruth, Naomi, and Orpah ,Hannah and Peninnah;\" \"Women of Israel's Monarchy: Michal, Bathsheba, Tamar, Queen of Sheba, Jezebel;\" \"Woman, The Image of God: Eve, Wisdom/Sophia;\" \"Women of Courage and Strength: Judith, Susanna;\" and \"Queen Esther.\" A bibliography is also included. Irene Nowell, OSB, is the director of community formation for the Benedictine sisters of Mount St. Scholastica in Atchison, Kansas. She is an experienced college and adult education teacher of Scripture and a workshop and retreat presenter. She is the author of Sing a New Song: The Psalms in the Sunday Lectionary, also published by The Liturgical Press. She is also a member of the editorial board for the revised Old Testament of the NAB.\"",

Cloud and Townsend introduce ten \"life principles\" and then demonstrate how eighteen real-world dilemmas are solved by their application. The book concludes with a plan to encourage each reader to develop a personal strategy for using these principles to bring about life-changing healing.",

A beautiful book, beautifully written.\u201d\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0Michael ChabonIn this rich and riveting narrative, a writer's search for the truth behind his family's tragic past in World War II becomes a remarkably original epic\u2014part memoir, part reportage, part mystery, and part scholarly detective work\u2014that brilliantly explores the nature of time and memory, family and history.The Lost begins as the story of a boy who grew up in a family haunted by the disappearance of six relatives during the Holocaust\u2014an unmentionable subject that gripped his imagination from earliest childhood. Decades later, spurred by the discovery of a cache of desperate letters written to his grandfather in 1939 and tantalized by fragmentary tales of a terrible betrayal, Daniel Mendelsohn sets out to find the remaining eyewitnesses to his relatives' fates. That quest eventually takes him to a dozen countries on four continents and forces him to confront the wrenching discrepancies between the histories we live and the stories we tell. And it leads him, finally, back to the small Ukrainian town where his family's story began, and where the solution to a decades-old mystery awaits him. Deftly moving between past and present, interweaving a world-wandering odyssey with childhood memories of a now-lost generation of immigrant Jews and provocative ruminations on biblical texts and Jewish history, The Lost transforms the story of one family into a profound, morally searching meditation on our fragile hold on the past. Deeply personal, grippingly suspenseful, and beautifully written, this literary tour de force illuminates all that is lost, and found, in the passage of time.",

It includes warmth, security, and, of course, sexual intimacy.Yet far too many Christian couples feel cheated because their marriage produces about as much spark as a book of wet matches. For them the kids, the long hours at the office, the bills, health issues, and even feelings of guilt leave them drained. Others have neglected to fan the flames of passion for so long that they have lost hope of experiencing romance. Their relationship has become as routine as it is lifeless. Some are so puzzled by the whole affair they have come to the wrong conclusion that God has withheld something good from them. In short, romance in marriage can be a challenge and a mystery.Rekindling the Romance is organized into a collection of short, easy-to-digest, biblically based chapters. Packed with practical insight, this tastefully candid and inviting resource provides the Christian couple with the keys to unlock their relational and sexual intimacy.",

More and more people -- Baby Boomers and information workers in particular -- are becoming concerned about their gray matter's ability to function, and with good reason. As this sensible and entertaining guide points out, your brain is easily your most important possession. It deserves proper upkeep.Your Brain: The Missing Manual is a practical look at how to get the most out of your brain -- not just how the brain works, but how you can use it more effectively.

You get a quick tour of several aspects of the brain, complete with useful advice about:Brain Food: The right fuel for the brain and how the brain commands hunger (including an explanation of the different chemicals that control appetite and cravings)Sleep: The sleep cycle and circadian rhythm, and how to get a good night's sleep (or do the best you can without it)Memory: Techniques for improving your recallReason: Learning to defeat common sense; logical fallacies (including tactics for winning arguments); and good reasons for bad prejudicesCreativity and Problem-Solving: Brainstorming tips and thinking not outside the box, but about the box -- in other words, find the assumptions that limit your ideas so you can break through themUnderstanding Other People's Brains: The battle of the sexes and babies developing brainsLearn about the built-in circuitry that makes office politics seem like a life-or-death struggle, causes you to toss important facts out of your memory if they're not emotionally charged, and encourages you to eat huge amounts of high-calorie snacks. With Your Brain: The Missing Manual you'll discover that, sometimes, you can learn to compensate for your brain or work around its limitations -- or at least to accept its eccentricities.Exploring your brain is the greatest adventure and biggest mystery you'll ever face. This guide has exactly the advice you need.",

Everything depends on the love relationship between you and  your child. When children feel loved, they do their best. But how can you make sure  your child feels loved?Since 1992, Dr. Gary Chapman's best-selling book  The 5Love Languages has helped millions of  couples develop stronger,  more fulfilling relationships by teaching them to speak each others' love language.  Each child, too, expresses and receives love through one of five different communication  styles. And your love language may be totally different from that of your child.  While you are doing all you can to show your child love, he may be hearing it as  something completely opposite. Discover your child's primary language and learn  what you can do to effectively convey unconditional feelings of respect, affection,  and commitment that will resonate in your child's emotions and behavior.",
