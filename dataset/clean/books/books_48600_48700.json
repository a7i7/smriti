        "Description": "In The Disciplined Mind, Howard Gardner argues that K-12 education should strive for a deep understanding of three classical principles: truth, beauty, and goodness. Such an understanding requires mastery of the major disciplines that human beings have created over the centuries. As powerful examples of his approach, Gardner describes an education that illuminates the theory of evolution, the music of Mozart, and the lessons of the Holocaust. Far from the standardized test mentality that has gripped both policy makers and the public, Gardner envisions an education that preserves the strengths of a traditional humane education while preparing younger generations for the challenges of the future.",

Divided into three parts - \"Process,\" \"Inspiration,\" and \"Practice\" - the book offers a practical methodology for successful artistic and professional work and also offers technical advice for translating this to the web (color, XML, streaming media, and other topics are discussed). Written with a subtle sense of humor and narration that really flows, this book is a joy to read, with great advice that helps designers with their own design work.",

And how many times have you headed home from work, looked around, and been struck with an awesome sense that you were surrounded by a world of geniuses and brilliant ideas? If you're like most people, caught up in the stress of work and everyday life, the answer is a resounding \"never!\" But that's all about to change.In Surrounded by Geniuses Alan Gregerman presents a revolutionary guide to personal, professional and organizational success based on two powerfully simple ideas:First, that there is genius hidden in all of us. And second, that we are surrounded by a world filled with genius that can be used to transform any company or organization in order to deliver compelling customer value.He then shows us in clear and practical ways how to unlock the genius in ourselves and our organizations by discovering and applying insight from the worlds of business, history, popular culture, nature, science and even science fiction. He does this by taking us on ten remarkable journeys to learn essential lessons from a world-class shock trauma unit, eight-year-old \"salespeople,\" rocket scientists, aerobics instructors, cheetahs, Seinfeld re-runs, and more. By the end, you will be astounded to find yourself surrounded by so many brilliant people and ideas. So grab your curiosity and your most comfortable shoes.

Stumbling headfirst into the ancient Chinese philosophy of feng shui, The Duct Tape Guys emerge totally bewildered--but not before creating their own breathtakingly crazy philosophy. Duct Shui, as they call it, reveals secrets of achieving harmony and happiness, all through the use of you-know-what.With its terrific die-cut package (just to hold it feels peaceful, like a perfectly balanced roll of duct tape), Duct Shui is the newest work of inspired nuttiness from the guys who created the 365 Days of Duct Tape Calendar, The Jumbo Duct Tape Book, and other books.In feng shui, wind chimes and bird feeders stimulate the flow of chi (energy) in a yard. In Duct Shui, attract birds by duct taping plastic decoys to a birdbath. In feng shui, placing a wind chime in the front area of a home or office will summon people to help you. Duct Shui teaches that if you really want help, get some duct tape stuck in your hair and then pull hard--the screams will draw plenty of attention. In feng shui, a wind chime over the stove will cure binge eating. Duct Shui says enough with the wind chimes already!-you can cure binge eating by placing duct tape firmly across your mouth. Includes a Da Ktap compass (instead of the Pa Kua compass used by feng shui consultants), its very own mantra (Duct Tape, Duct Tape, Duct Tape, whispered until tranquility or sleep is achieved), and a paean to that essential influence-the couch. Just take a roll, tear off a piece, and hear the energy crackle.",

        "Description": "\"This family did not have a drop of humanity in it before. I think Ive changed that.\" --DianaFor all the millions of words that have been written about the People's Princess, no one has yet penetrated palace walls to reveal what has really happened to the Royal Family she left behind ten years ago. Until now. In the manner of his No. 1 New York Times bestsellers The Day Diana Died and The Day John Died, as well as such other bestsellers as his Jack and Jackie, Jackie After Jack, and Diana's Boys, Christopher Andersen (who was consulted by Operation Paget, Scotland Yard's official inquiry into Diana's Death) draws on important new sources to paint the first full portrait of a Royal Family still haunted by the ghost of Diana.All the compelling elements of a true dynastic saga are here: power, sex, wealth, intrigue, betrayal, tragedy, and scandal. But so, too, is the Princess's legacy of love and compassionalive in the sons who have grown to manhood and are now forging a legacy of their own.Among After Diana's many stunning revelations:The many times Diana predicted with uncanny accuracy how she would die, why she feared for Camilla's life as well as her own -- and the surprising, never-before-revealed identity of the woman Diana really felt might one day be Queen.New details about the hours and days after Diana's death: Charles's reaction the moment he saw Diana's body, how Camilla dealt with suddenly becoming the most hated woman in the world, and her secret eight-year campaign to replace Diana.How William and Harry have dealt with the public and private pressures -- the troubling influence of their substance-abusing aristocrat friends; from drugs to Nazi uniforms to lap dances and barroom brawls, fresh details about the Princes wild behavior and the demons that still haunt them.How Charles cheated on Camilla as well as Diana, and the intriguing other women in the Prince of Wales's life.Despite Charles's heated denials, the behind-the-scenes maneuvering to make Camilla Queen -- and the Palace power struggle that rages today.Inside Operation Paget, Scotland Yard's ongoing probe into Diana's death -- why, ten years after, investigators were still shocked by what they found.The day Charles was asked point-blank by Scotland Yard if he killed his wife -- and what he said.The many beautiful young women in the lives of William and Harry over the past ten years -- including Will's longtime love Kate Middleton, her chances of one day becoming Queen, and why he fears she may meet the same fate as his mother.William's obsession with speed, Harry's hunger for risk-taking, and a shared thirst for battle that could lead both Princes to combat in Iraq.New information on whether the Queen plans to step aside and who she really wants to see succeed her on the throne.Sometimes heartbreaking, often inspiring, always riveting, After Diana is more than just the first comprehensive, compelling biography of the House of Windsor as it is today. It is a bittersweet tale of love, loss, duty, and destiny. It is the story of a family.",

But with the reappearance of their elderly, long-estranged father they find themselves reunited for a cold, snowy Thanksgiving week - a reunion that awakens sleeping tensions and old sorrows.Frances envisions a happy family holiday with her husband and daughters in her lovely old New England farmhouse. Cynthia, a writer of historical fiction, doesn't understand how Frances can ignore the past their father's presence revives, a past that includes suspicions about their mother's death twenty-five years earlier. Adding to her uneasiness is her research for a book on Mark Twain's daughters, whose lives she thinks eerily mirror her own and Frances's.As Thanksgiving day arrives, with a houseful of guests looking forward to dinner, the sisters continue to struggle with different versions of their shared past, until a warning issued by Cynthia's friend Carita, that \"families are toxic\" and \"blood is bloody,\" proves prophetically true.The Ghost at the Table reveals what happens when one person tries to rewrite another's history, and explores the mystery of why families try to stay together even when it may be in their best interests to stay apart.",

        "Description": "\"It wasn't a team.\u00a0\u00a0It was a tent revival.\"So says Pat Summitt, the legendary coach whose Tennessee Lady Vols entered the 1997-98 season aiming for an almost unprecedented \"three-peat\" of NCAA championships.\u00a0\u00a0Raise the Roof takes you right inside the locker room of her amazing team, whose inspired mixture of gifted freshmen and seasoned stars produced a standard of play that would change the game of women's basketball forever.The 1997-98 season started innocently enough.\u00a0\u00a0One Saturday in August, four young freshmen--Semeka Randall, Tamika Catchings, Ace Clement and Teresa Geter--arrived on the Tennessee campus to begin their college careers.\u00a0\u00a0Welcoming them were a number of players from the previous year, including Chamique Holdsclaw and Kellie Jolly.\u00a0\u00a0But that night, in a sign of things to come, a simple pickup game turned into an amazing display of basketball brilliance--freshmen against established players, and with barely a shot missed by either side.\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly Pat Summitt glimpsed the future: fast, aggressive and hugely talented.\u00a0\u00a0This might be the team she'd worked her whole career to coach.As the season got under way, other dramas unfolded.\u00a0\u00a0After one emotional team meeting, Summitt realized that many on the team were playing for something more than just the glory of the game: all four freshmen, for example, came from single-parent homes, and the tough circumstances of the majority of the other players seemed to add an extra edge to their desire to win it all.\u00a0\u00a0Further, Chamique Holdsclaw, widely regarded as the greatest female player ever, was being dogged by questions about turning pro--and she seemed reluctant to rule it out.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, another member of the team began to notice the unwelcome attentions of a fan, who soon turned out to be a full-fledged stalker.All this was behind the scenes; out on the court, the win column was swelling with every game: 8-0, 15-0, 21-0.\u00a0\u00a0As 1997 turned into 1998, Pat Summitt began privately to admit that this team had changed her: these kids were so lovable, funny and eager to please that she simply had to let them into her heart.\u00a0\u00a0Along the way, the Lady Vols were redefining what women were capable of, trading in old definitions of femininity for new ones--in short, they were keeping score.\u00a0\u00a0And by the time they entered the NCAA Final Four tournament in Kansas City, Summitt found herself believing the impossible: despite all the distractions, the 1997-98 Lady Vols could go undefeated, and, in doing so, raise the roof off the sport of women's basketball.Packed with the excitement of a season on the brink of perfection and filled with the comedy and tragedy of one year in the life of a basketball team, Raise the Roof will have readers cheering from the bench for a team of all-conquering players and their astonishing coach.",

        "Title": "The Egyptologist: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Phillips, Arthur",
        "Description": "From the bestselling author of Prague comes a witty, inventive, brilliantly constructed  novel about an Egyptologist obsessed with finding the tomb of an apocryphal king.  This darkly comic labyrinth of a story opens on the desert plains of Egypt in 1922,  then winds its way from the slums of Australia to the ballrooms of Boston by way  of Oxford, the battlefields of the First World War, and a royal court in turmoil. Just as Howard Carter unveils the tomb of Tutankhamun, making the most dazzling find  in the history of archaeology, Oxford-educated Egyptologist Ralph Trilipush is digging  himself into trouble, having staked his professional reputation and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s  fortune on a scrap of hieroglyphic pornography. Meanwhile, a relentless Australian  detective sets off on the case of his career, spanning the globe in search of a murderer.  And another murderer. And possibly another murderer. The confluence of these seemingly  separate stories results in an explosive ending, at once inevitable and utterly unpredictable. Arthur Phillips leads this expedition to its unforgettable climax with all the wit  and narrative bravado that made Prague one of the most critically acclaimed novels  of 2002. Exploring issues of class, greed, ambition, and the very human hunger for  eternal life, this staggering second novel gives us a glimpse of Phillips\u2019s range  and maturity\u2013and is sure to earn him further acclaim as one of the most exciting  authors of his generation.",

Bush is as hard-hitting an attack as has been leveled against the current president.\u201d \u2014Los Angeles Times\u201cGeorge W. Bush is a liar. He has lied large and small, directly and by omission. He has mugged the truth\u2013not merely in honest error, but deliberately, consistently, and repeatedly.\u201dIn this scathing indictment of the president and his inner circle, David Corn reveals the deceptions at the heart of the Bush presidency. With wit and style, Corn details how the Bush administration has consistently lied to the American public to advance its own interests, from mischaracterizing intelligence to whip up support for war with Iraq to misrepresenting the possible consequences of his supersized tax cut and offering false claims to push a radical agenda on crucial issues across the board. In this unflinching work of hard-hitting journalism, Corn explains how Bush has managed to get away with it and explores the danger of presidential deceit in a perilous age. This paperback edition also includes an up-to-date analysis of the aftermath of the war with Iraq.",

Pharmaceutical companies and their lobbyists have such influence in Washington that Medicare, by current law, is not allowed to negotiate lower drug prices. We import oil on an ever-increasing scale, putting ourselves into dept with the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, and other Middle Eastern nations. With their windfall profits, they continue to buy American assets. China\u2019s booming economy and abundance of cheap labor are threatening our economic survival. We have mortgaged our fortunes, our principles, and our way of life. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this comprehensive look at the real, human toll of America\u2019s unsound trade policy, Senator Byron Dorgan exposes the myth of \u201cfree trade.\u201d Indeed, free trade is not free; it is something that is slowly but surely draining away American prosperity. Sure, Chinese labor can drive down prices at Wal-Mart; at the same time, however, those saved wages\u2014dollars that would have gone to buy these cheaper goods\u2014are gone. Too soon, it will all come crashing down.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Major U.S. corporations continue to ship jobs overseas by the millions and, because of their influence in Washington, avoid paying a king\u2019s ransom in taxes. Many billions of dollars that these companies fleece from the government and the American people go overwhelmingly to investments in expanding production capabilities overseas. In short, our government is in the grip of corporate and foreign interests, and the American worker has born the brunt of this culture of corruption. How can we stem the tide of outsourcing?

One reviewer has written, 'What Smith doesn't write, what she leaves in the tiny spaces between sentences, between narrative moments, is as important as what she insists our attention be turned to.' What do you think the reviewer is trying to say? Do you agree with this statement? Are there instances in any of these stories that illustrate this point? 4. In each of these stories, you are offered glimpses of an array of remarkable, secondary characters. What minor characters intrigued you and made you want to hear more from them? For instance, what do you think happened to Carroll Byrd, the scandalous other woman in 'Live Bottomless'? 5. Just as Charlene made up Bubba, have you ever made up a story to create the self you thought you wanted to be? Did you find Charlene's dishonesty to be troubling? How do people separate fact from fiction in the telling of their own stories? 6. Why do you think Charlene was initially so resistant to telling stories based on her own experiences? Why did she think her own life was not worth talking about and what changed her mind? How do you deal with these issues in your own life? Are there stories you would not tell? Why is this so? 7. How did Sarah in 'Blue Wedding' become so isolated? How would the story change if Gladiola were telling it? Discuss how any of the stories might change if told by a different character; for example, if Jenny's father told the story of his affair and the subsequent trip to Key West with his family or if Alice's nurse was the narrator in 'The Happy Memories Club.' 8. A reoccurring theme here is the complicated nature of familial relationships. Discuss the nature of these relationships and how they do or do not change in these stories. Even as adults, we still often view our families through the eyes of a child as does Jenny in 'Live Bottomless.' How does this blind us? How do we heal the old wounds? Can we? 9. All of these stories explore the brother-sister relationship in some manner. Why do the siblings in many of these stories become estranged? Does that make the bond less important? 10. Why do you think Jenny's father had the affair? Do you think he made the right decision to stay with his wife and daughter? How do you think the adult Jenny who narrates the story really feels about her father's decision? 11. What sets Carroll Byrd apart from the other women in town? Why does Jenny find her so fascinating? 12. Do you think Jenny ended up with the life she envisioned as a precocious thirteen-year-old? Do any of these characters end up with the lives they planned on? Do any of us? 13. What price has Chanel paid for her upward mobility? What do you think she will do with her newfound perspective on her life? 14. Where do you think Chanel will end up? Or Sarah? How do you feel about the form of the short story that often leaves the reader guessing about the remainder of a life? 15. Why were Alice's stories about her life met with such hostility in 'The Happy Memories Club'? What does this story tell you about life in a retirement community? Do you think Alice feels trapped by the role she is supposed to play as a senior citizen? 16. The members of the Happy Memories Club are appalled that Alice does not talk about her long-time marriage in her stories. Why do you think she does not write about this part of her life at any length? Does it mean she didn't love her husband? 17. In 'News of the Spirit,' were you surprised that Drew stayed at the party? Do you think Paula underestimated her fianc\u00e9? Do you think Paula has learned to value her eccentric family? 18. Paula and Johnny lived in their own private world as children. Paula is still trying to figure out what changed and why. How would you answer her questions? 19. Did these fictional worlds resonate with your own experiences and your own stories? Or prompt you to think about the stories of your own life? What news of your own spirit would you most want to tell others? If you had to tell just one story about your own life, what story would it be and why? 20. Why did your group choose to read this particular book? Do you think you will go on to read other works by Lee Smith if you have not done so already? 21. How does this collection compare with other works that your group has read?",
