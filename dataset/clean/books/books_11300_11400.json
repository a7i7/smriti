        "Authors": "By Crossan, John Dominic",
        "Description": "The death of Jesus is one of the most hotly debated questions in Christianity today. In his massive and highly publicized The Death of the Messiah, Raymond Brown -- while clearly rejecting anti-Semitism -- never questions the essential historicity of the passion stories. Yet it is these stories, in which the Jews decide Jesus&#39; execution, that have fueled centuries of Christian anti-Semitism.  Now, in his most controversial book, John Dominic Crossan shows that this traditional understanding of the Gospels as historical fact is not only wrong but dangerous. Drawing on the best of biblical, anthropological, sociological and historical research, he demonstrates definitively that it was the Roman government that tried and executed Jesus as a social agitator. Crossan also candidly addresses such key theological questions as \"Did Jesus die for our sins?\" and \"Is our faith in vain if there was no bodily resurrection?\"  Ultimately, however, Crossan&#39;s radical reexamination shows that the belief that the Jews killed Jesus is an early Christian myth (directed against rival Jewish groups) that must be eradicated from authentic Christian faith.",

        "Authors": "By Byrd, Robert C.",
        "Description": "In the months and years following September 11, Senator Robert C. Byrd viewed with dismay what he considers a \"slow unraveling of the people's liberties,\" a time when dissenting voices were stilled and awesome power swung suddenly to the president to fight a \"war on terror.\"The way down this path violates historic American principles. It provides no regard for the balance of powers or the role of the Congress; it invades our privacy; it makes no attempt to educate the public and build consensus. It displays little regard for the environment. It grapples little with the realities of people who have to work for a living, rear children or care for aging parents, and cope with physical ailments - problems that plague our country and cry out for attention. Swept along, we have entered a war under a new and dangerous doctrine without proper consideration, and we have rushed dangerous legislation through Congress willy-nilly. We have a White House that favors the rich and the well-connected, lavishes tax cuts on big businesses, and pushes through unfair tax legislation.Most serious, this administration has, in greater measure than ever before, operated under a cloak of secrecy, which is deeply antithetical to the principles of our nation.For far too long, argues Senator Byrd, too many of us have passively gone along, aiding and abetting a dangerous process. Now is the time, he urges, to regain the Constitution that our forefathers so wisely left us, a time to return to the values and processes that made America great.",

        "Authors": "By Applewhite, Ashton",
        "Description": "One out of every two modern marriages ends in divorce, and 75 percent of those divorces are initiated by wives. Author Ashton Applewhite is one of these women, having sued for divorce after enduring an unfulfilling ten-year marriage.Cutting Loose is a wonderfully appealing book for women who want to leave their marriage but fear the consequences.Shattering the media-generated image of the lonely, deprived and financially strapped divorcee, Applewhite provides a much needed reality check.Cutting Loose introduces 50 women, varying in age, race, class and predicament, who have thrived after initiating their own divorces. Their fears of financial, emotional and romantic ruin were never realized; on the contrary, their lives improved immeasurably, and their self-esteem soared.Cutting Loose also answers the crucial questions: How do you finally decide to make the big break? What is getting divorced really like? What are the shortcomings of the legal process? What about custody and child support? financial and emotional survival? and how does a woman's self-image change during and after divorce?",

        "Description": "David Falkner brings to life Jack Roosevelt Robinson the man, a flesh-and-blood crusader whose humanity, passion, doubts, and fears are too often overlooked in the history-book treatment of his accomplishments. Falkner shows the roots of Robinson's commitment to the cause of his race, the depth of his involvement in that cause, and the occasional missteps along the way that have clouded our understanding of who Robinson was.Falkner recounts the important stories of Robinson's career: the meeting with Branch Rickey where Rickey demands that Robinson hold his temper for his first three years in the Dodgers organization; the near-boycott by the St. Louis Cardinals and other clubs, and the teammates who refused to shake his hand; the important friendship of Pee Wee Reese; the bold fury with which he played the game. But Falkner also gives new and groundbreaking attention to Robinson's post-baseball life, his role - actual, not symbolic - in the civil rights movement, and his often-misunderstood efforts to build for his community a lasting piece of the action.",

        "Title": "Rough Magic: Bill Walsh's Return to Stanford Football",
        "Authors": "By Cohn, Lowell",
        "Description": "Here is an exhilarating chronicle of the Stanford University football team's spectacular 1992 seasons and an incisive portrait of Bill Walsh, their idiosyncratic, ingenious coach, whom George Schulz has called \"a great intellect.\" Not since A Season on The Brink has there been such a revealing study of a great team and a great coach in action.When Walsh returned to Stanford in 1992 to coach its team, the Cardinal, he surprised many, including himself, by turning his back on a realm - professional sports - that he had conquered. During the fourteen years since he had last coached at Stanford, he had amassed a record and a reputation few men of his era could equal, having led the San Francisco 49ers to three Super Bowl wins and six divisional titles. The nickname \"Genius\" had been bestowed on him, and most in the sports community and beyond would use it without reservation. Even those few who added a dash of sarcasm when they used the moniker could not deny Walsh's brilliance.What drew Walsh back to Stanford (in what Time magazine called his \"Second Coming\") was its embodiment of the scholar-athlete ideal so rarely glimpsed today in the high-stakes world of college sports. What that idea meant for Walsh in real terms was a decent team, hampered by its school's high admission standards, surrounded by the toughest teams in the sport. What Walsh and his scholar-athletes did in his first year back astonished many. They achieved their first ten-win season since 1940, earned their first top ten ranking in over twenty years, and won their first bowl game since the Carter administration.Throughout that remarkable season, Lowell Cohn had unlimited access to Walsh, his coaches, and his players during every game, practice, scrimmage, and team meeting. The result of his immersion in the Cardinal's triumphant 1992 season is an account of singular intensity, depth, and eloquence. Certainly there is victory's thrill and defeat's agony here, but there is more besides: a trenchant depiction of a man driven by relentless intellectual energy and chased by perpetual self-doubt; a galvanizing story of how a disparate, squabbling collection of young men became united by success and by near tragedy; and indisputable proof that, at its best, football is as much an intellectual challenge as it is a physical one.",

        "Title": "Wait Till Next Year: A Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Goodwin, Doris Kearns",
        "Description": "Wait Till Next Yearis the story of a young girl growing up in the suburbs of New York in the 1950s, when owning a single-family home on a tree-lined street meant the realization of dreams, when everyone knew everyone else on the block, and the children gathered in the streets to play from sunup to sundown. The neighborhood was equally divided among Dodger, Giant, and Yankee fans, and the corner stores were the scenes of fierce and affectionate rivalries.  We meet the people who influenced Goodwin's early life: her father, who emerged from a traumatic childhood without a trace of self-pity or rancor and who taught his daughter early on that she should say whatever she thought and should bring her voice into any conversation at any time; her mother, whose heart problems left her with the arteries of a seventy-year-old when she was only in her thirties and whose love of books allowed her to break the boundaries of the narrow world to which she was confined by her chronic illness; her two older sisters; her friends on the block; the local storekeepers; her school friends and teachers. This is also the story of a girlhood in which the great religious festivals of the Catholic church and the seasonal imperatives of baseball combined to produce a passionate love of history, ceremony, and ritual. It is the story of growing up in what seemed on the surface a more innocent era until one recalls the terror of polio, the paranoia of McCarthyism reflected even in the children's games, the obsession with A-bomb drills in school, and the ugly face of racial prejudice. It was a time whose relative tranquillity contained the seeds of the turbulent decade of the sixties.",

But at night, no matter how hard she tries (and in spite of the Dream Machine her daughter Emily sent her) she can't stop her logical mind from running wild -- imagining burglars, strange noises, and all manner of trouble that might befall her fearless daughter.  Having just graduated from Wesleyan with a pierced tongue and an arsenal of opinions, Emily has always been passionate about her beliefs -- from mindfulness to vegetarianism to her new live-in boyfriend. Though Charlotte rarely understands her, she's learned to keep her doubts to herself. But when Emily and the new boyfriend arrive for a weekend visit, secrets are revealed that compel Charlotte to take a stand. Forced to examine her own life choices, she's about to learn she can't control everything. What she can do is open her heart to new possibilities, and to the fact that headstrong Emily might have a thing or two to teach them all.",

        "Description": "Although mathematical logic can be a formidably abstruse topic, even for mathematicians, this concise book presents the subject in a lively and approachable fashion. It deals with the very important ideas in modern mathematical logic without the detailed mathematical work required of those with a professional interest in logic.The book begins with a historical survey of the development of mathematical logic from two parallel streams: formal deduction, which originated with Aristotle, Euclid, and others; and mathematical analysis, which dates back to Archimedes in the same era. The streams began to converge in the seventeenth century with the invention of the calculus, which ultimately brought mathematics and logic together. The authors then briefly indicate how such relatively modern concepts as set theory, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, the continuum hypothesis, the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem, and other ideas influenced mathematical logic. The ideas are set forth simply and clearly in a pleasant style, and despite the book's relative brevity, there is much covered on these pages. Nonmathematicians can read the book as a general survey; students of the subject will find it a stimulating introduction. Readers will also find suggestions for further reading in this lively and exciting area of modern mathematics.",

        "Title": "Safe Harbour",
        "Authors": "By Steel, Danielle",
        "Description": "In her fifty-ninth bestselling novel, Danielle Steel tells an unforgettable story  of survival...of how two people who lost everything find hope...and of the extraordinary  acts of faith and courage that bring \u2014and keep\u2014 families together...  On a windswept  summer day, as the fog rolls across the San Francisco coastline, a solitary figure  walks down the beach, a dog at her side.  At eleven, Pip Mackenzie's young life has  already been touched by tragedy; nine months before, a terrible accident plunged  her mother into inconsolable grief.  But on this chilly July afternoon, Pip meets  someone who fills her sad gray world with color and light.  And in her innocence  and in his kindness, a spark will be kindled, lives will be changed, and a journey  of hope will begin.  From the moment the curly-haired girl walks up to his easel  on the sand, Matt Bowles senses something magical about her.  Pip reminds him of  his own daughter at that age, before a bitter divorce tore his family apart and swept  his children halfway across the world.  With her own mother, Oph\u00e9lie, retreating  deeper into her grief, Pip spends her summer at the shore the way lonely children  do: watching the glittering waters and rushing clouds, daydreaming and remembering  how things used to be.  That is, until she meets artist Matt Bowles, who offers to  teach the girl to draw\u2014and can't help but notice her beautiful, lonely mother.  At  first, Oph\u00e9lie is thrown off balance by her daughter's new companion\u2014until she realizes  how much joy he is bringing into their lives, despite the sadness she sees in his  eyes.  As their newfound friend works his subtle magic, mother and daughter slowly  begin to heal, to laugh again, to rediscover what they have lost.  When summer ends,  and Oph\u00e9lie and Pip must leave the beach for the city, the season of healing continues.   Gathering her newfound strength, Oph\u00e9lie begins a volunteer job at a city outreach  program, where she works with the homeless, and can no longer ignore the blessings  in her own life.  But as soul-sharing phone calls and autumn beach getaways deepen  Oph\u00e9lie and Matt's friendship, fate strikes another blow.  Out of the blue, Matt  must confront unfinished business from his past.  Days later, Oph\u00e9lie is struck by  a stunning betrayal by someone she trusts.  And as these events reverberate in two  already wounded hearts, something extraordinary happens.  Out of the darkness that  has shadowed them both comes an unexpected gift of hope.  With grace and compassion,  Danielle Steel explores the fragile bonds between mothers and daughters, husbands  and wives, family members and lifelong friends.  Her haunting, impassioned novel  takes us across the complex landscape of loss\u2014to the blessings that arise from even  the darkest tragedies.  At once a story of triumph and a moving elegy to those who  suffer and survive, Safe Harbour is perhaps her most powerful and life-affirming  novel to date.",

Trained by a journeyman who had been knocking around racing for more than thirty years, ridden by a hard-luck jockey, and owned by a tiny stable founded by a band of high school buddies from Sackets Harbor, NY (pop: 1,386), who tossed in a few thousand dollars each and decided to follow their dream, Funny Cide became a blue-collar hero with a bit, his story crammed with colorful characters-only one of which happened to be a horse.  Written with Sally Jenkins, coauthor of Lance Armstrong's number-one bestseller It's Not About the Bike, Funny Cide tells the whole story-the parts we know and the parts we never suspected-as it follows the group's emotional ups and downs against overwhelming odds, illness, and even scandal, to capture the imagination of millions.

        "Description": "\"All of us are scarred, but some go to extremes in the quest for the happy childhood they never had.\"Malachy McCourt -- actor, gadfly, raconteur, and author of the internationally bestselling memoir A Monk Swimming -- grew up amid death, squalor, poverty, and abuse in the lanes of Limerick, Irland. When he came to America as a young man, he brought a gargantuan appetite for what life had to offer -- and an equal drive to forget what it had delivered to him thus far.Alternately amused and aghast, but always fascinated, millions of readers followed McCourt through his twenties as he caroused his way all over the world, becoming a familiar face in movies and television, in New York and Hollywood, and in bars from Paris to Calcutta.In Singing My Him Song, McCourt tells us how he went from living the headlong and heedless life of a world-class drunk to becoming a sober, loving father and grandfather, still happily married after thirty-five years. We meet the woman who stood by his side all those years, watch as they build a family together, and listen as McCourt pursues a career of surprising successes and comic missteps.But while becoming the host of television and radio talk shows, appearing in dozens of movies and plays, and establishing himself as a well-loved regular on Ryan's Hope and One Life to Live, McCourt must also face the wreckage of his past. McCourt fights for the rights of his handicapped stepdaughter, exposing a scandal that still reverberates; helps steer his children away from the path he took; and finally comes to terms with the people and places that sent him careering along his misguided course. Then, just when it's time for the happy ending, he must gather all that he's learned, and the support of everyone he loves, to face and overcome the threat of cancer.Bawdy and funny, naked and moving, told in the same inimitable voice that left readers all over the world wondering what happened next, Malachy McCourt's Singing My Him Song tells as honest and entertaining a story as anyone could hope for.",

When she accidently falls through the ice while skating, she meets Jimmy. He is handsome, far older than she, and married, but she is entranced. As their relationship unfolds, so too does Katie's awareness of the pain and intensity first love can bring.Beautifully written in Berg's irresistible voice, Joy School portrays the soaring happiness one can feel at real love, the deep despair when it goes unrequited, and the stubbornness of hope that will not let us go. Here also is recognition that love can come in many forms and offer many different things. Joy School illuminates, too, how deep the things that hurt the most can sometimes teach us the lessons that really matter.",

Meter maids throughout the city are furious; citizens, naturally, are delighted. Only the police see the danger inherent in these escalating attacks.Jill sets out to track down the perpetrator, knowing all too well the sometimes deadly consequences of practical jokes. She learns of a possible witness to one of the pranks - Madeleine Riordan, a much-feared local attorney now dying of cancer at the Canyonview nursing home. Madeleine may have seen something - or someone - that will lead to an arrest. She agrees to one brief interview and promises a second. But when Jill returns for her statement, she finds Madeleine dead. Was she set up to find the corpse? Was it a pain-ending suicide or did Madeleine suspect that someone was trying to kill her? Perhaps the utterly principled, seemingly passionless lawyer was planning on having Jill find something else - something that ended Madeleine's plans for good.In her eighth Jill Smith mystery, Susan Dunlap once again displays her characteristic blend of wit, intelligence. and authenticity, and combines it with a sober, disturbing crime that puts her among the top ranks of mystery authors today.",

        "Description": "The Power Principle is a life-shifting book for all people - one that goes beyond traditional ideas of force, fear, clever negotiating and dealmaking as primary sources of power with others. Lee explores how we can truly influence people with honor instead of giving up, giving in, or taking over.Lee teaches that principle-centered power is the ability to influence others' behavior - not to control, change, or manipulate it. Power is something other people feel in your presence because of who you are, what you stand for, and where you are going. Honor is power, the kind of power that is genuine and lasting.Your influence can be significant when you elicit the highest and best from others. They value what you are about not because they obtained something in exchange and not because they are afraid of you, but because they believe in your integrity. Power gained because of what you can do to someone leads to temporary, reactive control. Power that relies on what you can do for someone yields only a conditional, unsustainable influence. However, as you exercise the power principle with others, they become empowered, trust and loyalty increase, and extraordinary results are possible.",

        "Authors": "By Ferling, John E.",
        "Description": "It was an age of fascinating leaders and difficult choices, of grand ideas eloquently expressed and of epic conflicts bitterly fought. Now comes a brilliant portrait of the American Revolution, one that is compelling in its prose, fascinating in its details, and provocative in its fresh interpretations.In A Leap in the Dark, John Ferling offers a magisterial new history that surges from the first rumblings of colonial protest to the volcanic election of 1800. Ferling's swift-moving narrative teems with fascinating details. We see Benjamin Franklin trying to decide if his loyalty was to Great Britain or to America, and we meet George Washington when he was a shrewd planter-businessman who discovered personal economic advantages to American independence. We encounter those who supported the war against Great Britain in 1776, but opposed independence because it was a \"leap in the dark.\" Following the war, we hear talk in the North of secession from the United States. The author offers a gripping account of the most dramatic events of our history, showing just how closely fought were the struggle for independence, the adoption of the Constitution, and the later battle between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans. Yet, without slowing the flow of events, he has also produced a landmark study of leadership and ideas. Here is all the erratic brilliance of Hamilton and Jefferson battling to shape the new nation, and here too is the passion and political shrewdness of revolutionaries, such as Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry, and their Loyalist counterparts, Joseph Galloway and Thomas Hutchinson. Here as well are activists who are not so well known today, men like Abraham Yates, who battled for democratic change, and Theodore Sedgwick, who fought to preserve the political and social system of the colonial past. Ferling shows that throughout this period the epic political battles often resembled today's politics and the politicians--the founders--played a political hardball attendant with enmities, selfish motivations, and bitterness. The political stakes, this book demonstrates, were extraordinary: first to secure independence, then to determine the meaning of the American Revolution. John Ferling has shown himself to be an insightful historian of our Revolution, and an unusually skillful writer. A Leap in the Dark is his masterpiece, work that provokes, enlightens, and entertains in full measure.",

        "Description": "The state police of Troop D in rural Pennsylvania have kept a secret in Shed B out back of the barracks ever since 1979, when Troopers Ennis Rafferty and Curtis Wilcox answered a call from a gas station just down the road and came back with an abandoned Buick Roadmaster. Curt Wilcox knew old cars, and he knew immediately that this one was...wrong, just wrong. A few hours later, when Rafferty vanished, Wilcox and his fellow troopers knew the car was worse than dangerous -- and that it would be better if John Q. Public never found out about it.  Curt's avid curiosity taking the lead, they investigated as best they could, as much as they dared. Over the years the troop absorbed the mystery as part of the background to their work, the Buick 8 sitting out there like a still life painting that breathes -- inhaling a little bit of this world, exhaling a little bit of whatever world it came from.  In the fall of 2001, a few months after Curt Wilcox is killed in a gruesome auto accident, his 18-year-old boy Ned starts coming by the barracks, mowing the lawn, washing windows, shoveling snow. Sandy Dearborn, Sergeant Commanding, knows it's the boy's way of holding onto his father, and Ned is allowed to become part of the Troop D family. One day he looks in the window of Shed B and discovers the family secret. Like his father, Ned wants answers, and the secret begins to stir, not only in the minds and hearts of the veteran troopers who surround him, but in Shed B as well....  From a Buick 8 is a novel about our fascination with deadly things, about our insistence on answers when there are none, about terror and courage in the face of the unknowable.",

Their musical daughter Alethea makes a disastrous marriage to a man whose charming manners conceal an unpleasant nature. Flinging caution to the winds, she flees her marital home, masquerading as a gentleman, and accompanied only by her redoubtable maid, Figgins, she sets off for Venice to take refuge with her sister Camilla. But events -- always dramatic and sometimes dangerous -- conspire to thwart her plans. Before she can meet up with Camilla, chance and her love of music lead her into the world of Italian opera, while her encounter with the aloof and difficult Titus Manningtree, in Italy to pursue a lost Titian painting, is to change her life -- although fate has several more tricks to play before she can find happiness.  With wit, aplomb, and delectable style, Elizabeth Aston once again re-creates the world of Jane Austen, populating her novel with captivating characters firmly rooted in Austen's traditions but distinctly her own, resulting in another delightful comedy of manners, morals, and marriage.",

The result, said 'The Sentinel,' \"blows a gust of fresh air into the old play\" while the Chicago Sun-Times called it \"audacious [and] consistently arresting.\" \"Mamet the adaptor has turned Chekhov's Cherry Orchard into a Mamet play. Mamet's ear is famously impeccable, the dialogue is always authentic and convincing . . . . This is a tribute to its strong point of view and clear point of departure. If nothing else, it will help to undermine our silly critical notions of 'definitive' Chekhov. Mamet has made me rethink the play.\" - Robert Brustein, 'The New Republic'",

This is just the book wannabe politicians (and everyone else) can consult to obtain a solid understanding on such things as \"Why were Medicare and Medicaid created?\" \"What are civil liberties?\" \"What is due process of law?\" \"What is the United Nations?\" Then there are the questions you always wanted to know, like, \"What is considered the dirtiest presidential campaign on record?\" And, \"If the president has a job description, what is it?\" Great questions for parties, but everyone knows you're not supposed to talk politics at social gatherings. That's why this book exists.",
