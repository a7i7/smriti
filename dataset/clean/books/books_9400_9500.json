This is a story of secrets and betrayals that stretch across four generations-secrets political, social, sexual, financial: all of them with the power to kill. Eager for something physical to do in the spirit-exhausting wake of 9/11, V.I. accepts a request from an old client to check up on an empty family mansion; sub-sequently surprises an intruder in the dark; and, giving chase, topples into a pond. Grasping for something to hold on to, her fingers close around a lifeless human hand.  It is the body of a reporter who had been investigating events of forty-five years earlier, during the McCarthy era, and V.I.'s discovery quickly sucks her into the history of two great Chicago families-their fortunes intertwined by blood, sex, money, and the scandals that may or may not have resulted in murder all these years later. At the same time, she inadvertently becomes involved in the story of a missing Egyptian boy whose possible terrorist connections make him very much sought after by the government. As the two cases drive her forward-and then shockingly tumble together-she finds that wealth and privilege, too, bear a terrible price; and the past has no monopoly on patriotic scoundrels. Before everything is over, at least two more people will lie dead . . . and V.I. might even be one of them.  A novel as passionate, complex, and powerfully entertaining as its acclaimed heroine, Blacklist is a stunning achievement.",

For a little over four years, I confronted dualities, and they confronted me. Hinduism versus Islam. East versus West. Male energy versus female. True spirituality versus false opportunism. I had to choose the values with which I wanted to live.Tantrika tells the compelling story of a woman whose world travels and spiritual journey bring her face-to-face with the most fundamental dichotomy of her identity. Born in India and raised in the foothills of West Virginia, Nomani moves away from her Muslim upbringing to pursue the Hindu and Buddhist path of divine love.What began as a professional assignment for the Wall Street Journal to write about America\u2019s hottest new fad, Tantra, became a very personal odyssey. While Tantra is popularly conceived as an ancient form of yoga or as \"sacred sex,\" the author's Muslim parents warn her it is a cult of black magic. In her search for the full story, Nomani travels from Santa Cruz to the feet of the Dalai Lama in Northern India, from meditation caves in Thailand to the homes of orthodox Muslims in Pakistan. Nomani's journey through the geography of her own spiritual conflict is a journey of self-discovery, of reconciling her Hindu ancestry and Muslim upbringing. She confronts darkness in ways she could never have imagined, but ultimately finds the path of the divine within herself and all women -- all \"tantrikas.\"",

In today's fast-paced world, knowledge is doubling nearly every seven years, while the life cycle of a business grows increasingly shorter. The best way -- and perhaps the only way -- to succeed is to become a \"knowledge-based\" business. In The Monster Under the Bed, Stan Davis and Jim Botkin show how:  * Every business can become a knowledge business * Every employee can become a knowledge worker * Every customer can become a lifelong learner  The Monster Under the Bed explains why it's necessary for businesses to educate employees and consumers. Consider the fact that the vast majority of 60 million PC owners, for example, learned to use their computers not at school but at work or at home. Davis and Botkin explain how any high-tech, low-tech, or no-tech company can discover new markets and create new sources of income by building future business on a knowledge-for-profit basis -- and how, once it does, its competitors must follow or fail.  Filled with examples of high-profile companies that are riding the crest of this powerful wave, The Monster Under the Bed is an insightful exploration of the many ways that the knowledge-for-profit revolution will profoundly affect our businesses, our educational processes, and our everyday lives.",

Aware of the risks involved, but determined to explore what he could of the Afghan people and culture, Elliot leaves the relative security of Kabul. He travels by foot and on horseback, and hitches rides on trucks that eventually lead him into the snowbound mountains of the North toward Uzbekistan, the former battlefields of the Soviet army's \"hidden war.\" Here the Afghan landscape kindles a recollection of the author's life ten years earlier, when he fought with the anti-Soviet mujaheddin resistance during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.Weaving different Afghan times and visits with revealing insights on matters ranging from antipersonnel mines to Sufism, Elliot has created a narrative mosaic of startling prose that captures perfectly the powerful allure of a seldom-glimpsed world.",

        "Authors": "By Marzollo, Jean, Trivas, Irene (ILT), and Trivas, Irene",
        "Description": "Fathers and Babies is the one and only baby care book written expressly for fathers.  Fathers and Babies is a light and reassuring introduction into the world of fatherhood. Fathers today want to be, and are expected to be, involved parents who bond with their children and help them thrive. Yet, sadly, many new fathers feel excluded from the loop of child care.  Because most fathers don't get to spend  as much time with their babies as mothers do, men don't learn the everyday skills of baby care. When they attempt to help out during evenings and on weekends, they frustrate themselves and those they are trying to help. Instead of becoming closer to their children, many fathers withdraw, conceding the domain of parenting to mothers. This is unfair to mothers, fathers, and their children.  What fathers desperately need is a special baby care training manual that will teach them how to fix a bottle, soothe a bay in the middle of the night, and help a child learn to talk. Fathers who are primary caregivers gain these skills easily. But most fathers are not primary caregivers; and because they can't spend more time with their children, they need help in order to become the great fathers they want to be.  Fathers and Babies provides step-by-step instructions accompanied by humorous, real-life pictures that show fathers what to do. The book also explains the important perceptual abilities, language skills, muscular coordination, strength, and concepts of trust and self-esteem that babies need to develop during the first eighteen months of life. The more fathers know about these critical developments, the more fathers will be able to help their babies achieve and the more worthy they will feel as parents.",

However, things aren't as simple as they appear -- Nora's letters eventually reveal life in the big city is less exotic than it seems, and the tranquil solitude of Clara's life is shattered by a series of unforeseeable events. These twists of fate require all of Clara's courage and strength, and finally put the seemingly unbreakable bond between the sisters to the test.",

Freshly rescued from a miserable experience at Camp Talequa, where she was housed with seven cruel cabin mates, Margaret is looking forward to spending the rest of her summer with her beloved great-uncles, Morris and Alexander. Little does she know, the Uncles themselves are in need of a rescue.  For the last forty-five years, the Uncles have been building three giant towers in their backyard from scrap metal and shards of glass and porcelain. But now, bowing to pressures from some powerful home owners, the towers have been declared a blight on the neighborhood. Even worse, the city council has voted to have them destroyed.  Margaret Rose is outraged. She knows the towers for what they truly are: irreplaceable works of art. To Margaret, the towers sing. They sing of the joy of making something big and beautiful out of bits and pieces; of integrity; but perhaps most important of all, they sing of history. And Margaret Rose is determined to make sure they always will.  This companion story to the acclaimed Silent to the Bone is a rousing tale of art, history, and the fierce preservation of individuality, as only the incomparable E. L. Konigsburg could write it.",

        "Description": "History and prehistory come alive in this extraordinary account of America as it was before it got its name. William H. MacLeish paints a heartrending portrait of the lush, miraculous New World on the eve of the Encounter - the arrival of the first Europeans, after which nothing was the same. Drawing on the work of anthropologists, geologists, and other academic experts, MacLeish roams over 18,000 years of the continent's history, exploring the roles of climate and human activity in preparing the world that we have inherited. The Day Before America is studded with fascinating information on the awesome transformations of the ice age (and the inevitability of its return), on the ecological effects of hunting and early agriculture, and on the astonishing variety of \"native\" civilizations. The book is informed by a deep commitment to the wonder and sanctity of the natural world, and at bottom, it is a statement of belief in an unsentimental environmentalism -- an effort to see our world i",

        "Description": "In Bloody Sundays, award-winning sportswriter Mike Freeman delivers an eye-opening appraisal of football, capturing the complexities and controversies of America's new national pastimeWith fascinating insights, Freeman goes beyond day-to-day newspaper journalism and ESPN highlights to take us deep inside the game and reveal the NFL in ways that will surprise even the most avid football fans. He travels to the sidelines and into the locker rooms to interview hundreds of players and coaches on their expertise. Breaking the game down to its three essential elements -- coaching, offense, and defense -- Freeman profiles in depth three of today's football elite: Jon Gruden, head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Michael Strahan, defensive end for the New York Giants; and Emmitt Smith, the legendary running back. Packed with football history and anecdotes, Bloody Sundays goes behind the scenes of the \"secret society\" of gay players who play in fear of their lives and careers. Freeman offers an exclusive and disturbing look at the life of a current player, the first time an active player addresses homosexuality and the warrior culture NFL. Freeman also studies how the violence of the game ravages the bodies of players only too willing to suit up and endure extraordinary pain every Sunday, damn the consequences. There is also the matter of how teams are only too willing to look the other way if a player's off-the-field violence doesn't affect his on-the-field performance.Bloody Sundays takes us into the owners' offices to look at the worst franchise in football, how teams spy on their players, and how intelligence tests determine whether or not a player will be drafted.Part tribute, part expos\u00e9, Bloody Sundays is a vivid portrait of professional football, the men who strap on their helmets every Sunday, and the men who lead them.",

        "Authors": "By Milano, Valerie",
        "Description": "Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow has lived the life of a Hollywood princess &#151; despite her parents\u2019 attempts to shelter her from the glare of the spotlight. The daughter of producer Bruce Paltrow and actress Blythe Danner, her family moved to New York from California when she was 11 years old, where she studied at elite East-coast prep schools. But Hollywood beckoned, and she returned to the West coast to attend college and pursue her own acting career. This biography will take a close look at those early days, when Gwyneth was better known for club-hopping with her pal Emily Lloyd than for her acting talents. It describes how Paltrow soon grew weary of being a part of the L.A. party scene, and got serious about her acting when she performed opposite her mother in the Williamstown Theater production of Picnic.Since 1991, Paltrow has appeared in 20 films &#151; including Shakespeare in Love, Great Expectations, Emma, Sliding Doors, and The Talented Mr. Ripley &#151; and has become the undisputed queen of the &#147;A\u201d list of independent actresses. Despite all these credits and accompanying accolades, Gwyneth is more famous for her off-screen love life than her on-screenperformances. Gwyneth Paltrow will offer a detailed look into her private life, including her relationships with Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck, and, most recently, Scott Speedman &#151; all of which began as on-set romances. In addition, her family life &#151; particularly her close relationships with her father, mother, brother, and grandfather &#151; are brought to life through the words of friends and associates. No doubt because she was (literally) raised on movie sets, Paltrow tends to remain aloof around both fans and the media. But as this book reveals, behind Gwyneth\u2019s cool blonde reserve lies a complex, intelligent, ambitious woman who has positioned herself to be in the forefront of Hollywood happenings well into the next millennium.",

With no hint of what sudden danger Danko encountered or information he uncovered that could have driven him to such extreme action, Covert-One operative Jon Smith is sent to the pre-arranged meeting place with instructions to bring Danko out. Ten days later, in Venice, Danko arrives breathless and bedraggled at Jon Smith's table at an outdoor cafe. But he barely opens his mouth before his body is ripped apart by a spray of assassins' bullets. Smith, eluding the hail of bullets, gives chase - only to witness the assassins themselves falling prey to a brutal execution. With only the scant clues left behind by Danko to go on, Jon Smith and Covert-One quickly conclude that someone is out to do the unthinkable - attempt to steal Russia's store of the smallpox virus. Now completely eradicated, smallpox is the deadliest of viruses and could well cause an epidemic of an undreamed-of scale should it be released in the general population. Smith and his Covert-One colleagues try to prevent the virus from being stolen. But their unseen adversaries are several steps ahead of them, and the virus is en route to the United States. Now they must unravel the complex scheme, overcome their powerful and invisible opponents, and recover or destroy the virus before the power of total Armageddon rests comfortably in the arms of a madman.",

        "Description": "Under her mother's constant scrutiny and lost in the shadow of her famous senator father, Melissa is the third child in the politically prominent Dickenson family, where ambition comes first and Melissa often comes last. In college, she meets Blake, a man of mixed race and apparently unknown parentage. His adoptive parents are lawyers whose defense of death-row cases in the past brought them head-to-head with Melissa's father when he was the governor of Pennsylvania.While Melissa and Blake's attraction is immediate and fiery, a dangerous secret lurks beneath their relationship -- one that could destroy them ... and their families.Provocative and beautifully written, and dealing with themes of love, honesty, identity, and the consequences of ambition, The Third Child is a remarkable page-turner.",

This explosive, behind-the-scenes book by investigative journalist Carl Limbacher blows the lid off the New York senator's plans for a grand political coup, something she has been carefully and quietly plotting far more than 20 years. Limbacher conducted extensive interviews with Clinton insiders - and even questioned Hillary herself - to bring you the real story. What he uncovers are the truly juicy morsels, the backroom deals, and the insider wrangling around Hillary's presidential ambitions that aren't being reported in the mainstream press. If you love to hate Hillary or are just curious about one of America's most controversial figures, there's plenty in this book to get your blood boiling.",

In the nearly forty years of pleasurable bafflement that have followed, he has composed essays for Golf Digest and short stories for The New Yorker concerning the sport; he has contributed to tournament programs and walked such fictional characters as Rabbit Angstrom and Tom Marshfield (of A Month of Sundays) through the details of a round. Golf is neither work nor play, he asserts: \"Golf is a trip.\"Golf has been the subject of many books and the province of many experts, but few have written as sympathetically, as knowingly, about the peculiar charms of bad golf, and the satisfactions of an essentially losing struggle. The camaraderie of golf, the perils of its present boom, how to relate to caddies, and how to manage short putts are among the many topics covered. These thirty pieces of pure gold have been dug up from a great variety of sources. Some have been published in one or another of Mr. Updike's other collections; most have not.",
