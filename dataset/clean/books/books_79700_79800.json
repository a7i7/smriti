        "Title": "The Working Leader: The Triumph of High Performance over Conventional Management Principles",
        "Authors": "By Sayles, Leonard R. and Mintzberg, Henry (CON)",
        "Description": "Schooled to oversee fixed, almost unvarying routines, managers today are unprepared to manage the conflicts in modern work flow relationships. The demand for more and quicker responsiveness to customers, market, product, and process changes means there are few \"routine\" technologies left to manage. The modern line manager, according to Sayles, must be a \"working leader,\" managing work flow relationships on the boundaries between jobs, functions, departments; making things \"work\" through trade-offs with superiors and peers. The working leader has an agenda, knows the system inside out, is comfortable with fluidity, and recognizes that the parts do not always fit into an integrated whole.  The recent emphasis on \"core competencies\" and \"operating capabilities\" as keys to competitive advantage represents a radical shift away from the presumption that business leadership is primarily about strategic decisions. Corporate success, Sayles insists, now depends upon execution, implementation, and expertise. In the past managers presumed that work systems were programmed to be efficient; now astute managers recognize that extraordinary efforts are required to attain and maintain effective operations.  Sayles shows with vivid case studies how middle managers with an in-depth understanding of the organization can resolve the inherent contradictions and ambiguities among design, sales, and manufacturing. He also shows that while many companies are instilling \"customer consciousness\" and \"quality consciousness\" as compartmentalized activities, effective management of work systems automatically leads to high performance in quality, efficiency, and service. By facilitating high performance, hands on working leaders can increase the sense of responsibility and motivation of subordinates. Finding solutions to inconsistencies and dilemmas in work systems forces managers to become real leaders. Checking the interfaces and making modifications where necessary -- managing on the boundaries -- are core competencies for the working leader.",

We meet Lyle Monelle and his mother, Jessie, who recognized early on that her little girl was in fact a boy and used her life savings to help Lyle make the transgender transition. On a Carnival cruise with a group of crossdressers and their spouses, we meet Peggy Rudd and her husband. \"Melanie, \"who devote themselves to the cause of \"ordinary heterosexual men with an additional feminine dimension.\" And we meet Hale Hawbecker, \"a regular, middle-of-the-road, white-bread guy\" with a wife, kids, and a medical condition, the standard treatment for which would have changed his life and his gender.Bloom shows the essential humanity in this infinite variety, allowing us to appreciate these people as they really are - both like and unlike everyone else - and inviting us \"to see into these particular worlds and back out to the larger one we all share.\" Casting light into the dusty corners of our assumptions about sex, gender, and identity, about what it means to be male or female. Bloom reveals new facets to ideas about happiness, personality, and character, even as she brilliantly illumines the very concept of \"normal.\"",

Now Tannen is back with another groundbreaking book, this time widening her lens to examine the way we communicate in public--in the media, in politics, in our courtrooms, and classrooms--once again letting us see in a new way forces that have powerfully shaped our lives.The war on drugs, the battle of the sexes, political turf combat--in the argument culture, war metaphors pervade our talk and influence our thinking. We approach anything we need to accomplish as a fight between two opposing sides. In this fascinating book, Tannen shows how deeply entrenched this cultural tendency is, the forms it takes, and how it affects us every day--sometimes in useful ways, but often causing damage.The Argument Culture is a remarkable book that will change forever the way you perceive--and communicate with--the world.",

        "Description": "The citizens of Rock County, Minnesota, experienced at least their fair share of suffering and tragedy during World War II. At times, the Rock County Star-Heralds front page brimmed with headlines and stories of area boys missing or killed overseas, their smiling photos providing evidence of better times before their lives were cut short by war. Al McIntosh shines during these moments of deepest despair, when it seemed there would be no end to the sacrifice of young lives. You can sense it in his voice, stubbornly determined and unabashedly patriotic; that of a man possessed. A gadfly in the best sense of the term, he challenged, cajoled, and spurred the locals to do their part, to buy war bonds, to salvage, save, and ration, to give voluntarily, and to stay personally engaged in the war effort. Like any great community leader, he raised their spirit by his own tireless example. Al McIntosh was an eyewitness to the ebbs and flows of one county during the most terrible yet necessary war our world has yet seen. The process of selecting the best of these columns came with a heavy burden of honoring the memory of both a man and a community that sacrificed so much during the war. A conscientious effort was made to include both the best and the most representative columns, compiled chronologically to show the growth of Al McIntosh as a writer and as a journalist. Selected Chaff recalls a nation and a community that, when called upon to do so, joined together at home and abroad to fight the \"necessary war.\" Selected Chaff is a rich collection of McIntosh's columns from the war period, including all of those read by actor Tom Hanks in the Burns documentary.",

        "Title": "Power Play: The Bush Presidency and the Constitution",
        "Authors": "By Pfiffner, James P",
        "Description": "The framers of the U.S. Constitution divided the federal government's powers among three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. Their goal was to prevent tyranny by ensuring that none of the branches could govern alone. While numerous presidents have sought to escape these constitutional constraints, the administration of George W. Bush went farther than most. It denied the writ of habeas corpus to individuals deemed to be enemy combatants. It suspended the Geneva Convention and allowed or encouraged the use of harsh interrogation methods amounting to torture. It ordered the surveillance of Americans without obtaining warrants as required by law. And it issued signing statements declaring that the president does not have the duty to faithfully execute hundreds of provisions in the laws he has signed. Power Play analyzes the Bush presidency's efforts to expand executive power in these four domains and puts them into constitutional and historical perspective. Pfiffner explores the evolution of Anglo-American thinking about executive power and individual rights. He highlights the lessons the Constitution's framers drew from such philosophers as Locke and Montesquieu, as well as English constitutional history. He documents the ways in which the Bush administration's policies have undermined the separation of powers, and he shows how these practices have imperiled the rule of law.Following 9/11, the Bush presidency engaged in a two-front offensive. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the administration aggressively prosecuted the \"war on terror.\" At home, it targeted constraints on the power of the executive.  Power Play lays bare the extent of this second campaign and explains why it will continue to threaten the future of republican government if the other two branches do not assert their own constitutional prerogatives.",

        "Description": "A former nine-time congressman from Ohio and one of the most respected commentators on politics and society, John Kasich believes that traditional American values are in serious danger of being lost. Kasich asserts that this erosion of moral values can be atttributed to, among other things, disappointing leadership from elected officials, the growing lack of ethics in business and sports, religious intolerance, and mass media and popular culture. By addressing such fundamental issues as honesty, personal responsibility, integrity, and the importance of leaving the world a better place, Kasich offers both a heartfelt and straightforward solution for all Americans to finally reset our moral compass and learn to STAND FOR SOMETHING.",
