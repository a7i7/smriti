From these he developed spiritual practices that allowed ordinary people to grow spiritually while dealing with the challenges of the everyday. Elizabeth Canham offers accessible insights from Benedict that will help us find a place of inner security in the midst of a mobile, transitory world. Canham guides us to a daily rhythm that balances work and rest, study and play, prayer and compassion. We discover anew that life with God is a journey that grows richer and more blessed as we hear and respond to divine grace. Upper Room.",

Something of a science buff, he finds that his disrupted personal history has been warped by the disjunctions and vagaries of the \u201cmany-worlds\u201d hypothesis derived from the indeterminacy of quantum theory. His identity branches into variants extending back through the past and forward into the evolution of the universe, as both it and his own mortal, nature-haunted existence move toward the end of time.",

Better than any other available resource, it tells what the roles of board members are and what they must and shouldn't do. An indispensable guidebook to leadership excellence.\"--George Weber, secretary general, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Geneva\"John Carver's Boards That Make a Difference was required reading for board members of the Calgary Philharmonic Society. It provided a clear and concise road map with which we carried out significant governance restructuring of the society.\" James M. Stanford, president & CEO,, Petro-Canada, and past chairman of the Calgary Philharmonic Society, Calgary, Alberta, CanadaJohn Carver's groundbreaking Policy Governance model has influenced the way public and nonprofit boards operate around the world. Now, as widespread experience with the model continues to grow, Carver enriches his definitive exposition with updated policy samples, a new chapter on the process of policy development, and additional resources for various types of boards. He debunks the entrenched beliefs about board roles and functions that hamper dedicated board members. With creative insight and commonsense practicality, Carver presents a bold new approach to board job design, board-staff relationships, the chief executive role, performance monitoring, and virtually every aspect of the board-management relationship. In their stead, he offers a board model designed to produce policies that make a difference, missions that are clearly articulated, standards that are ethical and prudent, meetings, officers, and committees that work; and leadership that supports the fulfillment of long-term goals.",

His chariot of choice is a rusted-out 1988 Mercedes 190D with 220,000 kilometers on its odometer; his route will take him from Holland through Morocco, across the Sahara, and into some of the least trodden parts of Africa. My Mercedes Is Not for Sale is a rollicking tale of an innocent abroad. The author finds himself facing a driving challenge akin to the Dakar Rally but encounters obstacles never dreamed of by race-car drivers: active minefields, occasional banditry\u2014mostly by the border guards\u2014and a teenage, chain-smoking desert guide with a fondness for Tupac lyrics. Food and water are scarce, sandstorms are frequent, and all he has to patch up his many car breakdowns thousands of miles from civilization is a bar of soap, some duct tape, and a pair of women\u2019s nylons. Then there\u2019s the coup he survived. My Mercedes Is Not for Sale captures more than the adventure\u2014it vividly portrays the impact of globalization on Africa through a surprise-filled journey into its thriving car culture, while asking the question: is the white man\u2019s burden really a used car?",

        "Description": "Anna Karenina, by Leo Tolstoy, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New introductions commissioned from today&#39;s top writers and scholars\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Biographies of the authors\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Footnotes and endnotes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments by other famous authors\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Study questions to challenge the reader&#39;s viewpoints and expectations\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bibliographies for further reading\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indices & Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader&#39;s understanding of these enduring works. Vladimir Nabokov called Leo Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina \u201cone of the greatest love stories in world literature.\u201d Matthew Arnold claimed it was not so much a work of art as \u201ca piece of life.\u201d Set in imperial Russia, Anna Karenina is a rich and complex meditation on passionate love and disastrous infidelity. Married to a powerful government minister, Anna Karenina is a beautiful woman who falls deeply in love with a wealthy army officer, the elegant Count Vronsky. Desperate to find truth and meaning in her life, she rashly defies the conventions of Russian society and leaves her husband and son to live with her lover. Condemned and ostracized by her peers and prone to fits of jealousy that alienate Vronsky, Anna finds herself unable to escape an increasingly hopeless situation. Set against this tragic affair is the story of Konstantin Levin, a melancholy landowner whom Tolstoy based largely on himself. While Anna looks for happiness through love, Levin embarks on his own search for spiritual fulfillment through marriage, family, and hard work. Surrounding these two central plot threads are dozens of characters whom Tolstoy seamlessly weaves together, creating a breathtaking tapestry of nineteenth-century Russian society. From its famous opening sentence\u2014\u201cHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\u201d\u2014to its stunningly tragic conclusion, this enduring tale of marriage and adultery plumbs the very depths of the human soul.",

        "Title": "Her Father's House: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Plain, Belva",
        "Description": "Beloved storyteller Belva Plain understands the rich tapestry of the human heart like no other. Her many dazzling New York Times bestsellers probe the shifting bonds of marriage and family with insight, compassion, and uncommon grace. And her new novel is no exception. A tale of fathers and daughters, lovers and families, acts of love and acts of betrayal, Her Father\u2019s House is Belva Plain\u2019s most powerful and unforgettable novel yet.It is the spring of 1968 when Donald Wolfe, a young graduate of a midwestern law school, arrives in New York. Filled with ambition and idealism, he is dazzled not only by the big city but by the vivacious, restless Lillian, whom he marries in the heat of infatuation. Surely theirs is no marriage made in heaven, but they have a child, Tina, and she is the love of Donald\u2019s heart. For her he would give up everything--his home, his distinguished career, and his freedom. When his flawed marriage begins to fail, a choice must be made. Shall he consider a step that would force him into flight and a life of hiding?From her earliest years, Tina is exceptional, a brilliant student and a joyous, loving spirit. At the university she falls in love with Gilbert, who graduates from law school just as she is about to enter medical school. Together they go to New York, where she learns the truth about her family\u2019s past, a truth that must change her regard for the father who has protected and cherished her. When a terrible lie has been told out of love, can it be forgiven?With courage and compassion, Belva Plain paints a moving portrait of the choices that shape the course of our lives, the secrets that haunt us, and the love that helps us heal and move on. It is a work of riveting storytelling and rare emotional power by one of the most gifted novelists of our time.",

        "Description": "The authors (of the U. of California at San Diego) of this introductory textbook on American politics emphasize the centrality of institutions in enabling and constraining collective decision making in the United States. They first offer chapters on what they see as the foundational elements of American national politics, the Constitution, federalism, civil rights, and civil liberties, explaining their development over time. They then examine Congress, the presidency, the bureaucracy, and the federal judiciary, discussing how the politics and logic of their development shaped their organizational features, practices, and relations with one another. Next come chapters examining the historical development, political logic, and present-day operations and activities of the institutions that link citizens with government officials, covering public opinion; voting, campaigns, and elections; political parties; interest groups; and the news media. A final chapter explores the dilemmas of institutional reform. Annotation \u00a92005 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)",

Here, for the first time, is the complete story of the legendary exploits and heroism of the thousands of courageous individuals who fought as spies, guerrillas, propagandists, and saboteurs behind enemy lines When the Japanese war juggernaut overran the Philippines, it took a near miraculous PT-boat escape for MacArthur to make his way to safety in Australia. He left behind a force of seventy thousand American and Philippine troops marooned on the Bataan Peninsula. To these brave men the general vowed, \"I shall return. Against overwhelming odds, MacArthur succeeded. Crucial to his success was his massive covert war effort. MacArthur created his own undercover warfare agency, the super-secret Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB), to organize the many far-flung resistance groups. They were the coast watchers\u2014jungle-wise miners, traders and planters, missionaries, and telegraph operators who occupied remote Pacific islands, living in the most primitive conditions while keeping a constant vigil for Japanese movement. They were American soldiers who escaped the Bataan Peninsula and were commanding guerrilla armies in the interior mountain and jungle locations of the Philippines. And they were double agents operating right under the noses of the Japanese in Manila, occupying positions close to the Imperial Army and in the collaborationist Philippine government The phenomenal success of MacArthur's island-hopping \"hit-'em-where-they-ain't\" campaign was built on the accuracy of the intelligence gathered by the AIB. Early in the conflict, the Americans cracked the secret Japanese naval code and established a chain of intelligence radio-monitoring posts circling the Japanese empire from Alaska to Australia. The information garnered from their interceptions of Japanese transmissions and from operatives on the ground allowed MacArthur to pick soft targets\u2014islands the Japanese had left relatively unguarded\u2014for invasion. It was the steel nerves and unbounded resourcefulness of those who fought the secret war that paved the way for MacArthur's \"Great Return\" to the Philippines and saved the lives of countless American soldiers In an action-packed narrative, MacArthur's Undercover War tells of thrilling feats of valor and derring-do\u2014impossible missions to blow up harbors, kidnap heads of state, undermine currency, and arrange prison escapes, all deep within enemy territory. Firsthand interviews with veterans and information from previously unpublished documents reveal a riveting tale of World War II that has never been fully told",

But while Ireland is her destiny, Isolde is already Queen of Cornwall, trapped in a loveless marriage to the mean-spirited King Mark. Her true love is his nephew, Tristan of Lyonesse, who has never married, remaining faithful to Isolde.Across the sea in France, a young princess who shares Isolde\u2019s name enters the story. King Hoel named his daughter in honor of Isolde of Ireland, but young Isolde of France has always been determined to outdo Queen Isolde. She, too, is a physician and is called \u201cBlanche Mains,\u201d for her white hands and healing touch. Blanche is of an age to be married, and she has chosen her husband\u2014Tristan of Lyonesse. Her father objects, but fate favors Blanche. King Mark has become suspicious of his wife and nephew, and when Tristan is wounded in battle, he sees a chance to separate them for good. Mark sends Tristan to France to be healed by Blanche, who makes the most of the opportunity. Tristan\u2019s letters to Isolde are intercepted, and he is told that she has given him up. Near death from his wounds, Tristan sends one last desperate letter to Isolde by a trusted servant. He is dying, he tells her, and asks for one final sign of their love. If she can forgive him for marrying another, she must come to France in a ship set with white sails. If the ship\u2019s sails are black, he will know that she no longer loves him. Isolde immediately leaves for France, but when Blanche sees the white sails from the castle window, she pulls the curtains and tells Tristan that they are black. To her horror, he turns his face to the wall and dies.There ends the traditional medieval story of Tristan and Isolde\u2014with betrayal, death, and grief. But the original Irish legend ends differently, and so does this book, with magic and drama as only Rosalind Miles can write it.",
