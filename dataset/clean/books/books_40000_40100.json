With these ambitions and with their own abundant charms, Schuyler and his daughter soon find themselves at the centers of American social and political power at a time when the fading ideals of the young republic were being replaced by the excitement of empire.------\"A glorious piece of writing,\" said Jimmy Breslin in Harper's. \"Vidal can take history and make it powerful and astonishing.\" Time concurred: \"Vidal has no peers at breathing movement and laughter into the historical past.\"------With a new Introduction by the author.From the Hardcover edition.",

And now, in his hilarious primer How to Really Stink at Golf, Foxworthy shares his invaluable tips for a lifetime of horrible drives and putts.\u2022 Get into the right frame of mind to play truly awful golf. Food poisoning or a killer hangover might be just the ticket to a robust three-digit score.\u2022 Try to get to the course promptly at tee time to avoid the hassle of warming up: \u201cYou\u2019re only gonna hit five good shots in the course of the day; why waste even one on the driving range?\u201d\u2022 The surefire way to screw up a great drive?

How to Really Stink at Golf covers it all, from selecting the correct putter to use on a 385-yard drive to prolonging your stay in the sand trap to picking the perfect foursome for spectacularly bad golf (\u201cyou, your ex-wife, your girlfriend, your wife\u201d). With Jeff Foxworthy as your guide, even a scratch golfer can add ten, twenty, maybe thirty strokes to his or her score\u2013and possibly more if you attempt to play the back nine, too.",

        "Authors": "By Sheed, Wilfrid",
        "Description": "From Irving Berlin to Cy Coleman, from \u201cAlexander\u2019s Ragtime Band\u201d to \u201cBig Spender,\u201d from Tin Pan Alley to the MGM soundstages, the Golden Age of the American song embodied all that was cool, sexy, and sophisticated in popular culture. For four glittering decades, geniuses like Jerome Kern, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Harold Arlen ran their fingers over piano keys, enticing unforgettable melodies out of thin air. Critically acclaimed writer Wilfrid Sheed uncovered the legends, mingled with the greats, and gossiped with the insiders. Now he\u2019s crafted a dazzling, authoritative history of the era that \u201ctripled the world\u2019s total supply of singable tunes.\u201dIt began when immigrants in New York\u2019s Lower East Side heard black jazz and blues\u2013and it surged into an artistic torrent nothing short of miraculous. Broke but eager, Izzy Baline transformed himself into Irving Berlin, married an heiress, and embarked on a string of hits from \u201cAlways\u201d to \u201cCheek to Cheek.\u201d Berlin\u2019s spiritual godson George Gershwin, in his brief  but incandescent career, straddled Tin Pan Alley and Carnegie Hall, charming everyone in his orbit. Possessed of a world-class ego, Gershwin was also generous, exciting, and utterly original. Half a century later, Gershwin love songs like \u201cSomeone to Watch Over Me,\u201d \u201cThe Man I Love,\u201d and \u201cLove Is Here to Stay\u201d are as tender and moving as ever.Sheed also illuminates the unique gifts of the great jazz songsters Hoagy Carmichael and Duke Ellington, conjuring up the circumstances of their creativity and bringing back the thrill of what it was like to hear \u201cGeorgia on My Mind\u201d or \u201cMood Indigo\u201d for the first time. The Golden Age of song sparked creative breakthroughs in both Broadway musicals and splashy Hollywood extravaganzas. Sheed vividly recounts how Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Jerome Kern, and Johnny Mercer spread the melodic wealth to stage and screen.Popular music was, writes Sheed, \u201cfar and away our greatest contribution to the world\u2019s art supply in the so-called American Century.\u201d Sheed hung out with some of the great artists while they were still writing\u2013and better than anyone, he knows great music, its shimmer, bite, and exuberance. Sparkling with wit, insight, and the grace notes of wonderful songs, The House That George Built is a heartfelt, intensely personal portrait of an unforgettable era.A delightfully charming, funny, and most illuminating portrait of songwriters and the Golden Age of American Popular Song. Mr. Sheed\u2019s carefully chosen depictions and anecdotes recapture that amazingly creative period, a moment in time in which I was so fortunate to be surrounded by all that magic.\u201d\u2013Margaret WhitingFrom the Hardcover edition.",

But one politician manages to escape this treatment, getting the benefit of the doubt and a positive spin for nearly everything he does: John McCain. Indeed, even during his temporary decline in popularity in 2007, the media continued to support him by lamenting his fate rather than criticizing the flip flops and politicking that undermined his popular image as a maverick.David Brock and Paul Waldman show how the media has enabled McCain's rise from the Keating Five scandal to the underdog hero of the 2000 primaries to his roller-coaster run for the 2008 nomination. They illuminate how the press falls for McCain's \u201cstraight talk\u201d and how the Arizona senator gets away with inconsistencies and misrepresentations for which the media skewers other politicians. This is a fascinating study of how the media shape the political debate, and an essential book for every political junkie.",

        "Title": "Henry VIII: The King and His Court",
        "Authors": "By Weir, Alison",
        "Description": "At the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII, his virtues were extolled by those who served him. How does the adulation the young King initially inspired of the court compare to the subsequent attitudes his courtiers held toward him? In which ways was he burdened by unrealistic expectations? How did the King manipulate his early reputation to his advantage? 2. It's an adage that a man can often be judged by the company he keeps. How did this prove true of Henry VIII? How much choice did he have over who comprised the court, and how much of it was determined by external factors (for example, tradition, custom, blood ties, or the influence of others)? 3. How did the rich physical appearance of the court and his various palaces reflect the way that Henry VIII felt about himself and his place in the world? Why were opulent surroundings, including innovations in architecture, so important to him? How did the physical arrangement of the King's palaces establish the hierarchy of his courtiers? 4. What characteristics of a courtier do you think that the King held in highest regard? Which characteristics were undesirable? Can you apply these to advisors of leaders in modern times? In your opinion, which of the King's courtiers was most successful in serving Henry VIII? Who was the most successful in advancing his own personal interests? 5. How did the itinerant nature of the court and its constant movement from place to place affect its makeup? How might it have been different--both physically and politically--if it had been permanently situated in one spot? 6. The Privy Council and the Privy Chamber formed the most elite core of Henry's courtiers and advisors. Was this similar or different to the setup of the King's father, Henry VII? What were the differences between the two groups? How did these individuals wield their influence? How did Henry VIII's mistrust of the gentry shape the court, and how did it prove less constrained by a strict social hierarchy than the outside world as a whole at that time? 7. At the time of Henry VIII's kingship, the ideas of the Renaissance were flourishing. Which of these ideas were most influential to the King and his court? How did influential humanists--for example, Petrarch or Sir Thomas More--shape the thoughts and policies of the King? How was the King's warlike spirit at odds with the opinions of his humanist friends and confidants? 8. Thomas Wolsey enjoyed a spectacular rise to power, becoming a cardinal who was considered as powerful--or even more--than his master, Henry VIII. Which attributes make him indispensable to the King? How does he arouse antipathy from the others around him? What role does his background, breeding, and personal ambition play in his rise and eventual downfall? What purpose did Wolsey serve for both his friends and his enemies? 9. How could the King's favor--or displeasure--toward a courtier affect their fortunes? Examples to discuss could include Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas Cromwell, Archbishop Cranmer, Sir Thomas More, the Duke of Suffolk, Sir Nicholas Carew, and Fray Diego Fernandez. 10. Henry VIII's love for Anne Boleyn changed not only the court, but also the path of England. It led to the King's 'Great Matter'--his desire to nullify his marriage to Queen Katherine of Aragon. How did this issue factionalize the court? What issues do you believe it eclipsed, and which did it bring to the forefront? How did the religious climate of the time, and Luther's 95 Theses in particular, also affect the question of religion? 11. Anne Boleyn positioned herself as a paragon of virtue and morality. How did this contrast with her ascent to the throne and some of her own personal characteristics? How did her influence compare to that enjoyed by Katherine, and how did pomp and patronage play into her reign? How did the opinion held of her by the courtiers evolve, and how did that compare to public's view of her? What attributes that initially attracted Henry to her proved to be her undoing? 12. Thomas Cromwell was the second powerful figure to take precedence in the court of Henry VIII. How did he compare to Wolsey? In which ways did Cromwell wield more influence on the King and on the policies of England than Wolsey? Why? How was his downfall similar to that of Wolsey? How was he merely the victim of his adversaries? 13. How did the question of succession shape not only Henry VIII's marriages and liaisons, but also the court in general? How did the birth of Prince Edward affect this? What type of relationship do you believe that Henry's children by three different mothers enjoyed with one another? In particular, how did the relationship between Mary and Elizabeth thrive? What restrictions were placed upon it? 14. How did the lavish spending on coronations, palaces, queens, and wartime activity affect the later years of the King? How did he react to the constant scourge of plague and illness? 15. How was the Reformation of Henry VIII a dividing point between the conservatives and the radicals of his court? How was the Act of Six Articles, which established the doctrine of the Church of England as law, received by both groups? What elements of the Act most reflected Renaissance thinking? 16. How did Henry's advisors use the King's faith to their own advantage, often in ousting their enemies? How did his position of head of the Church influence the King and his way of thinking? In your opinion, how much of his faith was motivated by personal desires (for example, the nullification of his marriages)? 17. How did the various wives--particularly Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn--wield power and influence? How were they employed to advance the interests of particular courtiers, especially in regard to alliances with other countries? Which causes were advanced by each Queen? 18. How were at least three of the wives removed from power by the maneuverings of the King, the court, or both? Do you think that the influence enjoyed by women in Henry VIII's court was unusual based on the gender attitudes of the time? Why or why not? 19. At the close of his life, Henry VIII had grown quite ill. How did this affect the day-to-day workings of the court and the King's advisors? How would you characterize the management style of the King? Would you say that Henry VIII was by nature a laissez-faire manager, or was he merely forced to become one because of his failing health? Why or why not?",

        "Description": "In this swiftly paced, breathlessly suspenseful debut novel, the bizarre rampage of an elusive serial killer sends shockwaves through Boston, igniting a harrowing police manhunt and resounding at the highest levels of the criminal justice system. Drawing on eleven years\u2019 experience as a Boston assistant district attorney\u2013and as chief prosecutor with the elite Gang Unit\u2013Raffi Yessayan renders a stark, realistic, and gripping portrait of law enforcement professionals on the job, and under the gun, in a city at the mercy of a madman.The scene is perplexingly always the same: the home of a single woman, no signs of forced entry, no evidence of an intruder, and no victim\u2013only a bathtub filled with blood. Newly promoted homicide detective Angel Alves wants to make his mark in the department and a difference on the streets. But juggling the needs of a family and the demands of a relentlessly driven partner tests the young cop\u2019s commitment as sorely as tracking the killer challenges his skills. Meanwhile, assistant DA Conrad Darget has his own hands full\u2013mentoring an ambitious young law student, whom he is also dating, rallying his fellow attorneys in their daily courtroom battles, and striving to win true justice in an imperfect system. With each new attack the twisted mystery only deepens, and the hunger for answers\u2013and action\u2013intensifies. No sane mind could comprehend the dark design behind it all. And no one can anticipate the final fateful strokes that will lead to a shocking endgame.From its chilling first pages to its heart-stopping home stretch, Eight in the Box thrills at every turn and surprises at every opportunity\u2013racing at an ever increasing velocity to deliver a climax that pays off in devastating style.",

        "Title": "The Pentagon: A History",
        "Authors": "By Vogel, Steve",
        "Description": "The creation of the Pentagon in seventeen whirlwind months during World War II is one of the great construction feats in American history, involving a tremendous mobilization of manpower, resources, and minds. In astonishingly short order, Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell conceived and built an institution that ranks with the White House, the Vatican, and a handful of other structures as symbols recognized around the world. Now veteran military reporter Steve Vogel reveals for the first time the remarkable story of the Pentagon\u2019s construction, from it\u2019s dramatic birth to its rebuilding after the September 11 attack. At the center of the story is the tempestuous but courtly Somervell\u2013\u201cdynamite in a Tiffany box,\u201d as he was once described. In July 1941, the Army construction chief sprang the idea of building a single, huge headquarters that could house the entire War Department, then scattered in seventeen buildings around Washington. Somervell ordered drawings produced in one weekend and, despite a firestorm of opposition, broke ground two months later, vowing that the building would be finished in little more than a year. Thousands of workers descended on the site, a raffish Virginia neighborhood known as Hell\u2019s Bottom, while an army of draftsmen churned out designs barely one step ahead of their execution. Seven months later the first Pentagon employees skirted seas of mud to move into the building and went to work even as construction roared around them. The colossal Army headquarters helped recast Washington from a sleepy southern town into the bustling center of a reluctant empire.Vivid portraits are drawn of other key figures in the drama, among them Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president who fancied himself an architect; Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall, both desperate for a home for the War Department as the country prepared for battle; Colonel Leslie R. Groves, the ruthless force of nature who oversaw the Pentagon\u2019s construction (as well as the Manhattan Project to create an atomic bomb); and John McShain, the charming and dapper builder who used his relationship with FDR to help land himself the contract for the biggest office building in the world. The Pentagon\u2019s post-World War II history is told through its critical moments, including the troubled birth of the Department of Defense during the Cold War, the tense days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the tumultuous 1967 protest against the Vietnam War. The pivotal attack on September 11 is related with chilling new detail, as is the race to rebuild the damaged Pentagon, a restoration that echoed the spirit of its creation.This study of a single enigmatic building tells a broader story of modern American history, from the eve of World War II to the new wars of the twenty-first century. Steve Vogel has crafted a dazzling work of military social history that merits comparison with the best works of David Halberstam or David McCullough. Like its namesake, The Pentagon is a true landmark. \"Among books dealing with seemingly impossible engineering feats, this easily ranks with David McCullough\u2019s The Great Bridge and The Path Between the Seas, as well as Ross King\u2019s Brunelleschi\u2019s Dome.\"           -Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review)\"Vogel artfully weaves architectural and cultural history, thus creating a brilliant and illuminating study of this singular (and, in many ways, sacred) American space.\"                                                                                -Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)\"An amazing story, expertly researched and beautifully told.

        "Title": "Ghost: Confessions of a Counterterrorism Agent",
        "Authors": "By Burton, Fred",
        "Description": "For decades, Fred Burton, a key figure in international counterterrorism and domestic spycraft, has secretly been on the front lines in the fight to keep Americans safe around the world. Now, in this hard-hitting memoir, Burton emerges from the shadows to reveal who he is, what he has accomplished, and the threats that lurk unseen except by an experienced, world-wise few.In the mid-eighties, the idea of defending Americans against terrorism was still new. But a trio of suicide bombings in Beirut\u2013including one that killed 241 marines and forced our exit from Lebanon\u2013had changed the mindset and mission of the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), the arm of the State Department that protects U.S. embassy officials across the globe. Burton, a member of DSS\u2019s tiny but elite Counterterrorism Division, was plunged into a murky world of violent religious extremism spanning the streets of Middle Eastern cities and the informant-filled alleys of American slums. From battling Libyan terrorists and their Palestinian surrogates to having facing down hijackers, hostages, and Hezbollah double agents, Burton found himself on the front lines of America\u2019s first campaign against Terror.In this globe-trotting account of one counterterrorism agent\u2019s life and career, Burton takes us behind the scenes to reveal how the United States tracked Libya-linked master terrorist Abu Nidal; captured Ramzi Yusef, architect of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; and pursued the assassins of major figures including Yitzhak Rabin, Meir Kahane, and General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the president of Pakistan\u2013classic cases that have sobering new meaning in the treacherous years since 9/11. Here, too, is Burton\u2019s advice on personal safety for today\u2019s most powerful CEOs, gleaned from his experience at Stratfor, the private firm Barron\u2019s calls \u201cthe shadow CIA.\u201dTold in a no-holds-barred, gripping, nuanced style that illuminates a complex and driven man, Ghost is both a riveting read and an illuminating look into the shadows of the most important struggle of our time.Praise for GHOST\u201cWith spy thriller suspense and the clarity of a police report, former special agent Burton\u2019s State Department saga reads like a brewing-storm prequel to the current war on terror ... Of obvious interest to anyone with an eye on world affairs.... Most striking is the material\u2019s relevance twenty years later; Burton\u2019s clashes with Hezbollah in Beirut and prickly diplomacy with Iran could almost be pulled from present-day newspapers\u201d\u2014Publisher's Weekly\u201cIn many ways, this book reads like a le Carr\u00e9 spy novel: it\u2019s not flashy, not filled with pyrotechnics, not full of chase scenes and derring-do. Rather, it\u2019s the story of a working man whose job involved trying to prevent people from attacking his country. Shorn of ideological rights and wrongs, it\u2019s a fascinating look at what counterterrorism really means on a day-to-day level.\u201d \u2014Booklist\u201cThe world of counterterrorism is like that old jigsaw puzzle in the back of the closet: its many missing pieces and extra parts jumbled in from other puzzles make it almost impossible to assemble. But in Ghost, Fred Burton manages to join together enough pieces to give us a discerning look at that world. This is a story, told in human terms, that will help make sense of the great puzzle of our times.\u201d \u2014Eric L. Haney, author of Inside Delta Force and executive producer of The Unit\u201cBurton\u2019s memoir of fighting the defensive fight against the burgeoning terrorist threat in the 1980s and beyond is a revealing personal journal of the stress and boredom involved in putting the pieces of the puzzle together to obtain justice. Fred Burton was there, and you will be as well.\u201d                                                                                          \u2014Bobby R.

        "Description": "\u201cMy wooing began in passion, was defined by violence and circumscribed by land; all these elements molded my soul.\u201d So writes Charles O\u2019Brien, the unforgettable hero of bestselling author Frank Delaney\u2019s extraordinary new novel\u2013a sweeping epic of obsession, profound devotion, and compelling history involving a turbulent era that would shape modern Ireland.\u00a0Born into a respected Irish-Anglo family in 1860, Charles loves his native land and its long-suffering but irrepressible people. As a healer, he travels the countryside dispensing traditional cures while soaking up stories and legends of bygone times\u2013and witnessing the painful, often violent birth of land-reform measures destined to lead to Irish independence.At the age of forty, summoned to Paris to treat his dying countryman\u2013the infamous Oscar Wilde\u2013Charles experiences the fateful moment of his life. In a chance encounter with a beautiful and determined young Englishwoman, eighteen-year-old April Burke, he is instantly and passionately smitten\u2013but callously rejected. Vowing to improve himself, Charles returns to Ireland, where he undertakes the preservation of the great and abandoned estate of Tipperary, in whose shadow he has lived his whole life\u2013and which, he discovers, may belong to April and her father. As Charles pursues his obsession, he writes the \u201cHistory\u201d of his own life and country. While doing so, he meets the great figures of the day, including Charles Parnell, William Butler Yeats, and George Bernard Shaw. And he also falls victim to less well-known\u00a0characters\u2013who prove far more dangerous. Tipperary also features a second \u201chistorian:\u201d a present-day commentator, a retired and obscure history teacher who suddenly discovers that he has much at stake in the telling of Charles\u2019s story.In this gloriously absorbing and utterly satisfying novel, a man\u2019s passion for the woman he loves is twinned with his country\u2019s emergence as a nation. With storytelling as sweeping and dramatic as the land itself, myth, fact, and fiction are all woven together with the power of the great nineteenth-century novelists.

        "Description": "I have been standing on the side of life, watching it float by. I want to swim in  the river. I want to feel the current. So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary  as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright.  Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned  architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a  powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each  married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and  forever change their lives.  In this ambitious debut novel, fact and fiction blend  together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in  the life of America\u2019s greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to  their dramatic love story and illuminates Cheney\u2019s profound influence on Wright.   Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling  narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose  between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan\u2019s Mamah is a woman  seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world. Mamah\u2019s is  an unforgettable journey marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility,  leading inexorably ultimately lead to this novel\u2019s stunning conclusion.    Elegantly  written and remarkably rich in detail, Loving Frank is a fitting tribute to a courageous  woman, a national icon, and their timeless love story.

It is engrossing, provocative reading.\u201d \u2014Scott Turow \u201cIt  takes great courage to write a novel about historical people, and in particular to  give voice to someone as mythic as Frank Lloyd Wright.

Shaped like a miter\u2019s cap or delicately hued like the pearl-colored petticoats of a duchess, scented like honeyed almonds or nodding heavily in the wind, every old-fashioned rose possesses a unique character. And their names\u2013often drawn from history and mythology\u2013have stories as enchanting and evocative as the flowers themselves. This gorgeously photographed collection of fifty exquisite roses reveals how some of the world\u2019s most storied, beloved plants received their names, and how the names go hand in hand with the flowers\u2019 appearance and fragrance. It\u2019s a voyage of discovery for rose connoisseurs, garden enthusiasts, and anyone else who appreciates delicate blooming beauty.Joining the rose parade are:storied characters such as Greenmantle, the heroine of Sir Walter Scott\u2019s novel Redgauntlet. As attention-getting as the character\u2019s exquisite green silk cape, the rose\u2019s leaves, rather than its blossoms, are the source of its heady fragrance. Artful personalities such as Peter Paul Rubens, the Flemish master whose paintings often featured the luminous skin of voluptuous goddesses. Fittingly, his namesake rose is a heavenly flesh color, tinged with pink.Heroes, heroines, and rascals such as Napol\u00e9on. The petals of his eponymous rose become darker and more disheveled as they age, much like the emperor who fell deep into madness after building an empire.Nobles and notables such as King Louis-Philippe. Some liken the rich fragrance of this rose to cherries, although the shape of its buds may be more true to its namesake\u2019s character: The king was often portrayed in caricatures as a pear. Well-bred ladies and gents such as the intrepid British tea thief Robert Fortune. On a secret mission in China, he clipped the rose that became known as \u2018Fortune\u2019s Double Yellow\u2019. With vivid accounts of the colorful figures who inspired the names of the roses and with lyrical descriptions of the flowers themselves, Pink Ladies & Crimson Gents is a valentine to the rose, a feast for the eyes, and a delightful gift for any romantic soul.",

        "Title": "The Lady Elizabeth: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Weir, Alison",
        "Description": "Following the tremendous success of her first novel, Innocent Traitor, which recounted the riveting tale of the doomed Lady Jane Grey, acclaimed historian and New York Times bestselling author Alison Weir turns her masterly storytelling skills to the early life of young Elizabeth Tudor, who would grow up to become England\u2019s most intriguing and powerful queen.Even at age two, Elizabeth is keenly aware that people in the court of her father, King Henry VIII, have stopped referring to her as \u201cLady Princess\u201d and now call her \u201cthe Lady Elizabeth.\u201d Before she is three, she learns of the tragic fate that has befallen her mother, the enigmatic and seductive Anne Boleyn, and that she herself has been declared illegitimate, an injustice that will haunt her. What comes next is a succession of stepmothers, bringing with them glimpses of love, fleeting security, tempestuous conflict, and tragedy. The death of her father puts the teenage Elizabeth in greater peril, leaving her at the mercy of ambitious and unscrupulous men. Like her mother two decades earlier she is imprisoned in the Tower of London\u2013and fears she will also meet her mother\u2019s grisly end. Power-driven politics, private scandal and public gossip, a disputed succession, and the grievous example of her sister, \u201cBloody\u201d Queen Mary, all cement Elizabeth\u2019s resolve in matters of statecraft and love, and set the stage for her transformation into the iconic Virgin Queen. Alison Weir uses her deft talents as historian and novelist to exquisitely and suspensefully play out the conflicts between family, politics, religion, and conscience that came to define an age. Sweeping in scope, The Lady Elizabeth is a fascinating portrayal of a woman far ahead of her time\u2013an orphaned girl haunted by the shadow of the axe, an independent spirit who must use her cunning and wits for her very survival, and a future queen whose dangerous and dramatic path to the throne shapes her future greatness.",

        "Title": "The Downhill Lie: A Hacker's Return to a Ruinous Sport",
        "Authors": "By Hiaasen, Carl",
        "Description": "Ever wonder how to retrieve a sunken golf cart from a snake-infested lake? Or which club in your bag is best suited for combat against a horde of rats? If these and other sporting questions are gnawing at you,The Downhill Lie, Carl Hiaasen\u2019s hilarious confessional about returning to the fairways after a thirty-two-year absence, is definitely the book for you.Originally drawn to the game by his father, Carl wisely quit golfing in 1973, when \u201cRichard Nixon was hunkered down like a meth-crazed badger in the White House, Hank Aaron was one dinger shy of Babe Ruth\u2019s all-time home run record, and The Who had just releasedQuadrophenia.\u201d But some ambitions refuse to die, and as the years\u2014and memories of shanked 7-irons\u2014faded, it dawned on Carl that there might be one thing in life he could do better in middle age than he could as a youth. So gradually he ventured back to the dreaded driving range, this time as the father of a five-year-old son\u2014and also as a grandfather.\u201cWhat possesses a man to return in midlife to a game at which he\u2019d never excelled in his prime, and which in fact had dealt him mostly failure, angst and exasperation? Here\u2019s why I did it: I\u2019m one sick bastard.\u201dAnd thus we have Carl\u2019s foray into a world of baffling titanium technology, high-priced golf gurus, bizarre infomercial gimmicks and the mind-bending phenomenon of Tiger Woods; a maddening universe of hooks and slices where Carl ultimately\u2014and foolishly\u2014agrees to compete in a country-club tournament against players who can actually hit the ball. \u201cThat\u2019s the secret of the sport\u2019s infernal seduction,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt surrenders just enough good shots to let you talk yourself out of quitting.\u201dHiaasen\u2019s chronicle of his shaky return to this bedeviling pastime and the ensuing demolition of his self-esteem\u2014culminating with the savage 45-hole tournament\u2014will have you rolling with laughter. Yet the bittersweet memories of playing with his own father and the glow he feels when watching his own young son belt the ball down the fairway will also touch your heart. Forget Tiger, Phil and Ernie. If you want to understand the true lure of golf, turn to Carl Hiaasen, who has written an extraordinary book for the ordinary hacker.",

Despite holding views at odds with the majority of Americans, these zealots have given us an endless war in Iraq, a sputtering economy, a health care system on life support, a war on science and reason, and an immoral embrace of torture.But they haven\u2019t done it on their own: they have been enabled by a compliant media that act as if there is no such thing as truth and are more interested in cozying up to those in power than in holding them accountable, and by feckless Democrats who have allowed themselves to be intimidated into backing down again and again.Both a withering indictment and a hopeful call to arms, Right Is Wrong is an explosive, boldly incisive work that will help set the national agenda.",

        "Description": "Hopes for a new peaceful international order after the end of the Cold War have been dashed by sobering realities: Great powers are once again competing for honor and influence. Nation-states remain as strong as ever, as do the old, explosive forces of ambitious nationalism. The world remains \u201cunipolar,\u201d but international competition among the United States, Russia, China, Europe, Japan, India, and Iran raise new threats of regional conflict. Communism is dead, but a new contest between western liberalism and the great eastern autocracies of Russia and China has reinjected ideology into geopolitics. Finally, radical Islamists are waging a violent struggle against the modern secular cultures and powers that, in their view, have dominated, penetrated, and polluted their Islamic world. The grand expectation that after the Cold War the world would enter an era of international geopolitical convergence has proven wrong.For the past few years, the liberal world has been internally divided and distracted by issues both profound and petty. Now, in The Return of History and the End of Dreams, Robert Kagan masterfully poses the most important questions facing the liberal democratic countries, challenging them to choose whether they want to shape history or let others shape it for them.",

        "Title": "Washington Burning: How a Frenchman's Vision for Our Nation's Capital Survived Congress, the Founding Fathers, and the Invading British Army",
        "Authors": "By Standiford, Les",
        "Description": "The Riveting Story of the Federal City and the Men Who Built ItIn 1814, British troops invaded Washington, consuming President Madison\u2019s hastily abandoned dinner before setting his home and the rest of the city ablaze. The White House still bears scorch and soot marks on its foundation stones. It was only after this British lesson in \u201chard war,\u201d designed to terrorize, that Americans overcame their resistance to the idea of Washington as the nation\u2019s capital and embraced it as a symbol of American might and unity. The dramatic story of how the capital rose from a wilderness is a vital chapter in American history, filled with intrigue and outsized characters\u2013from George Washington to Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant, the eccentric, passionate, difficult architect who fell in love with his adopted country. This Frenchman\u2013both inspired by the American cause of liberty and wounded while defending it\u2013first endeared himself to then General Washington with a sketch drawn at Valley Forge. Designing buildings, parades, medals, and coins, L\u2019Enfant became the creator of a new American aesthetic, but the early tastemaker had ambition and pride to match his talent. Self-serving and incapable of compromise, he was consumed with his artistic dream of the Federal City, eventually alienating even the president, his onetime champion.Washington struggled to balance L\u2019Enfant\u2019s enthusiasm for his brilliant design with the strident opposition of fiscal conservatives such as Thomas Jefferson, whose counsel eventually led to L\u2019Enfant\u2019s dismissal. The friendships, rivalries, and conflicting ideologies of the principals in this drama\u2013as revealed in their deceptively genteel correspondence and other historical sources\u2013mirror the struggles of a fledgling nation to form a kind of government the world had not yet known. In these pages, as in Last Train to Paradise and Meet You in Hell, master storyteller Les Standiford once again tells a compelling, uniquely American story of hubris and achievement, with a man of epic ambition at its center. Utterly absorbing and scrupulously researched, Washington Burning offers a fresh perspective on the birth of not just a city, but a nation.",

        "Title": "Wastrels of Defense: How Congress Sabotages U.S. Security",
        "Authors": "By Wheeler, Winslow T.",
        "Description": "In this damning expose, a veteran senate defense advisor argues that since Sept 11, 2001, the conduct of the U.S. Congress has sunk to new depths and endangered the nation's security. Winslow Wheeler draws on three decades of work with four prominent senators to tell in lively detail how members of Congress divert money from essential war-fighting accounts to pay for pork in their home states, cook the budget books to pursue personal agendas, and run for cover when confronted with tough defense issues. With meticulous documentation to support his claims, he contends that this behavior is not confined to one party or one political philosophy. He further contends that senators who sell themselves as reformers and journalists covering Capitol Hill are simply not doing their jobs. Pork is far from a new phenomenon in Washington, yet most Americans fail to understand its serious consequences. Wheeler knows the harm it does and challenges citizens to take action against lawmakers pretending to serve the public trust while sending home the bacon. Dubbed a \"Hill Deep Throat\" who participated in the game he now criticizes, he fills his book with evidence of Congressional wrongdoing, naming names and citing specific examples. Pointing to the extremes that have become routine in the legislative process, he focuses on defense appropriations and Congress's willingness to load down defense bills with pork, in some cases with the Pentagon's help. On the question of deciding war, he accuses today's members of Congress of lacking the character of their predecessors, often positioning themselves on both sides of the question of war against Iraq without probing the administration's justifications. Wheeler concludes with a model for reform that he calls twelve not-so-easy steps to a sober Congress.",

Then, on September 11, 2001, his job was transformed into the greatest leadership challenge an attorney general has ever faced. Highly classified intelligence briefings, secret surveillance of terror cells, and war councils with President Bush gave Ashcroft a uniquely comprehensive--and uniquely chilling--view of the threats to American security.  [In this work] Ashcroft breaks his silence about historic events that transpired during his term of office--including the largest terrorist attack in U.S. history, the enactment and defense of the Patriot Act, the Robert Hanssen spy scandal, theexecution of Timothy McVeigh, and the recently discovered domestic surveillance program authorized by President Bush.\"--From publisher description.",

Friedman is in a unique position to interpret the world for American readers. Twice a week, Friedman's celebrated commentary provides the most trenchant, pithy,and illuminating perspective in journalism.Longitudes and Attitudes contains the columns Friedman has published about the most momentous news story of our time, as well as a diary of his experiences and reactions during this period of crisis.  As the author writes, the book is \"not meant to be a comprehensive study of September 11 and all the factors that went into it. Rather, my hope is that it will constitute a 'word album' that captures and preserves the raw, unpolished, emotional and analytical responses that illustrate how I, and others, felt as we tried to grapple with September and its aftermath, as they were unfolding.\"Readers have repeatedly said that Friedman has expressed the essence of their own feelings, helping them not only by explaining who \"they\" are, but also by reassuring us about who \"we\" are. More than any other journalist writing, Friedman gives voice to America's awakening sense of its role in a changed world.",

In this city, you can get anything done for a price. If you want someone's eyeglasses smashed, it'll cost you a subway token. You want his fingernails pulled out? His legs broken? You want him more seriously injured? You want him hurt so he's an invalid his whole life? You want him skinned, you want him burned, you want him -- don't even mention it in a whisper -- killed? It can be done. Let me talk to someone. It can be done.  The hanging death of a nondescript old man in a shabby little apartment in a meager section of the 87th Precinct was nothing much in this city, especially to detectives Carella and Meyer. But everyone has a story, and this old man's story stood to make some people a lot of money. His story takes Carella, Meyer, Brown, and Weeks on a search through Isola's seedy strip clubs and to the bright lights of the theater district. There they discover an upcoming musical with ties to a mysterious drug and a killer who stays until the last dance.  The Last Dance is Ed McBain's fiftieth novel of the 87th Precinct and certainly one of his best. The series began in 1956 with Cop Hater and proves him to be the man who has been called \"so good he should be arrested.\"",

The Clintons' terror and harassment continue. Over 2007 Labor Day weekend, Kathleen's home was burglarized. Instead of taking jewelry or computers, the thief took the manuscript for Target, with its explosive revelations that could damage Sen. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.It was a break-in all too reminiscent of an earlier incident in which Kathleen was threatened by a stranger just two days before she was to testify against President Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. It's deju vu all over again - and a timely reminder of how cunning and ruthless the Clintons' desire for power remains.",

        "Title": "The Devil's Guide to Hollywood: The Screenwriter as God!",
        "Authors": "By Eszterhas, Joe",
        "Description": "Mike Ovitz told him his Wilshire Blvd. \"foot soldiers\" would hunt him down. He's antagonized almost everyone at the top in Tinseltown. And now, Joe Eszterhas tells everything he knows -- in brief, quotable bursts -- about the business, the history of Hollywood, and how to write screenplays that make millions. Idiosyncratic, gruff and as shaggy as Eszterhas himself, The Devil's Guide to Hollywood makes a character/leitmotif of Eszterhas' fellow Hungarian Zsa Zsa Gabor (\u201cMoney is like a sixth sense that makes it possible for you to fully enjoy the other five.\u201d), and makes the case that Marilyn Monroe was the sharpest tack in Hollywood (\u201cHollywood is a place where they\u2019ll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty cents.\u201d). Refreshing, dirty, tough, there's no book like it.",

With two rambunctious young sons to raise, Marie Dorion refuses to be left behind in St. Louis when her husband heads West with the Wilson Hunt Astoria expedition of 1811.

On the journey, Marie meets up with the famous Lewis and Clark interpreter, Sacagawea. Both are Indian women married to mixed-blood men of French Canadian and Indian descent, both are pregnant, both traveled with expeditions led by white men, and both are raising sons in a white world. Together, the women forge a friendship that will strengthen and uphold Marie long after they part, even as she faces the greatest crisis of her life, and as she fights for her family\u2019s very survival with the courage and gritty determination that can only be fueled by a mother\u2019s love.",
