These are actual images that informed American newspaper readers at home about the progress of the war.Taken together, these photographs form a portrait of war in both the European and Pacific theaters - a panorama of events from the rise of Hitler and the invasion of Poland to the dropping of the atomic bombs and the surrender of Japan. Arranged chronologically, with detailed captions and prefaced with essays by Bob Dole and Walter Cronkite, they give form to the dark passions and high ideals that shaped the course of the war.",

Lured to a motel in Pumis City, Virginia, by a known snitch, the only thing the agents discover is a glowing red timer. The place is demolished in a catastrophic explosion, but everyone survives.  The same snitch leads them to Arlington National Cemetery, promising the agents Pinky's safe return. The search is interrupted when Savich takes a fateful call on his cell. The mysterious caller taunts Savich with other threats-against him, and against his wife, fellow agent Lacey Sherlock. Up against an untraceable foe-not even MAX can locate him-Savich and Sherlock find themselves fighting an unstable villain with a very long memory.  At the same time, Agent Ruth Warnecki's passion for treasure hunting leads her to Winkel's Cave and a cave chamber that really shouldn't exist-as well as a dead student from Stanislaus Music School, left there for eternity. Some students have wandered quite far from the beaten path, with terrible consequences.

If Cap wants to do the same thing, Grandpa will be happy to help. He'll even coach the team if the league gets off the ground. It does, and soon Cap and his friends are learning the rules of six-man football. Cap is in competition for the starting quarterback spot with Jimmy Cash, but that's not a problem. What is a problem is that Grandpa and Jimmy's grandfather have reignited an old football feud. When their rivalry starts to affect the team, Cap wonders if the team will survive.

        "Description": "Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom rode the tidal wave of takeovers in the 1970s and '80s to become the most profitable law firm in the world. At its peak, partners there earned an average of over $1 million a year. Unabashedly competitive and zealously private, Skadden, as the firm is known, was different from leading firms of previous eras: they had reflected the might and luster of their clients, but Skadden became a big business in its own right, with global reach and power. At its center was corporate America's most sought-after legal adviser, the firm's street-smart, media-wise senior partner and presiding genius, Joe Flom, rainmaker par excellence.In this unprecedented look at the culture and history of American lawyering, Lincoln Caplan describes Skadden's origins in the still-white-shoe New York legal universe of the early post-war period and its rise, with the growing sophistication of battles for corporate control, to dazzling preeminence in the era of Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert - the firm's largest client in the eighties. Skadden takes readers inside a tribe with its own vocabulary and rites of passage, showing us Skadden's view of itself as an aggressive meritocracy - which prizes opportunists and does not consider it a compliment to be called a gentleman and at the same time created a unique $10 million program to support young public-interest lawyers. And, in a penetrating look at the process of making partners, Caplan describes the shifts Skadden has made in response to the changed business climate of the 1990s - as well as the increasingly global practice of law, in which the firm has once again been a groundbreaker. In many ways a history of the development of the legal profession in the post-war period, the story of Joe Flom's firm is about power, money, and a profound shift in values that illuminates an era in American business and society.",

They are the perfect twenty-first-century couple: successful, attractive, self-sufficient, and understanding of the all-too-frequent absences that can sometimes make theirs a virtual marriage.While lecturing in Texas, Michelle literally runs into Wilson Collins as she's backing out of a parking space. The handsome Texan is badly banged up and Michelle feels just awful. She performs one kindness after another as she tries to get him medical help and then get him home. A friendship blooms and, almost as quickly, love does, too. Unlike everyone else in Michelle's life, Wilson has simple needs and desires and, to her immense surprise, she finds that she is someone very different when she\u2019s with him. It\u2019s not that she doesn't love her husband--she does. She just happens to love two men, and the second one wants to marry her, too.Have you ever wondered how many different lives a person could live or how very different one's life might be if fate were to intervene at exactly the right moment? Could you be happy living two entirely different lives? Sit back and enjoy Kate Lehrer's romantic, thought-provoking novel that is simultaneously smart and playful, poignant and compulsively readable.",

        "Description": "In a novel where ancient traditions conflict with reality and the pressures of modern  life, a young European princess proves that simplicity, courage, and dignity win  the day and forever alter her world. In blue jeans and a pullover, Princess Christianna  is a young woman of her times: born in Europe, educated in America, worried about  the future of the world she lives in, responsible beyond her years.  Christianna  is the only daughter of the Reigning Prince of a European nation that takes its royalty  seriously\u2013and her father has ironclad plans for Christianna\u2019s life, a burden that  is almost unbearable. Now, after four years at Berkeley, life in her father\u2019s palace  cannot distract Christianna from what she sees outside the kingdom\u2013the suffering  of children, the ravages of terrorism and disease.  Determined to make a difference  in the world, she persuades His Royal Highness, her father, to let her volunteer  for the Red Cross in East Africa.  And for Christianna, a journey of discovery, change,  and awakening begins. Under a searing East African sun, Christianna plunges into  the dusty, bustling life of an international relief camp, finding a passion and a  calling among the brave doctors and volunteers.  Finally free from the scrutiny of  her royal life, Christianna struggles to keep her identity a secret from her new  friends and coworkers\u2013even from Parker Williams, the young doctor from Doctors Without  Borders who works alongside Christianna and shares her dedication to healing.  But  as violence approaches and invades the camp, and the pressures of her royal life  beckon her home, Christianna\u2019s struggle for freedom takes an extraordinary turn.   By a simple twist of fate, in one shocking moment, Christianna\u2019s life is changed  forever\u2013in ways she never could have foreseen. From the splendor of a prince\u2019s palace  to the chaos of war-torn nations, Danielle Steel takes us into fascinating new worlds.   Filled with unforgettable images and a remarkable cast of characters, H.R.H. is  a novel of the conflict between old and new worlds, responsibility versus freedom,  and duty versus love.",

        "Authors": "By Waley, Arthur (TRN) and Murasaki, Lady",
        "Description": "Completed in the early 11th century, The Tale of Genji is considered the supreme masterpiece of Japanese prose literature, and one of the world's earliest novels. A work of great length, it comprises six parts, the first part of which (also called The Tale of Genji) is reprinted here. The exact origins of this remarkable saga of the nobility of Heian Japan remain somewhat obscured by time, although its author, Lady Shikibu Murasaki, presumably derived many of her insights into court life from her years of service with the royal family.The novel centers on the life and loves of the prince known as \"the shining Genji.\" Far more than an exotic romance, however, the tale presents finely drawn characters in realistic situations, set against a richly embroidered tapestry of court life. Moreover, a wistful sense of nostalgia pervades the accounts of courtly intrigues and rivalries, resulting in an exquisitely detailed portrayal of a decaying aristocracy.Vibrant in its poetry and wordplay, subtle in its social and psychological observations, this work ranks in stature and significance with such Western classics as Cervantes' Don Quixote and Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. This inexpensive edition, featuring Arthur Waley's splendid translation of the first of the six-part series, offers readers a memorable taste of one of the world's first and greatest novels.",

In The Final Solution, he has condensed his boundless vision to create a short, suspenseful tale of compassion and wit that re-imagines the classic 19th-century detective story.In deep retirement in the English countryside, an 89-year old man, vaguely recollected by the locals as a once-famous detective, is more concerned with his bookkeeping than his fellow man. Into his life wanders Linus Steinman, nine years old and mute, who has escaped from Nazi Germany with his sole companion: an African grey parrot. What is the meaning of the mysterious strings of German numbers the bird spews out-a top-secret SS code? The keys to a series of Swiss bank accounts? Or do they hold a significance at once more prosaic and far more sinister?Though the solution to this last case may be beyond even the reach of the once famed sleuth, the true story of the boy and his parrot is subtly revealed to the reader in a wrenching resolution to this brilliant homage. The Final Solution is a work from a master story-teller at the height of his powers.",

        "Description": "The Big Squeeze takes a fresh, probing, and often shocking look at the stresses and strains faced by tens of millions of American workers as wages have stagnated, health and pension benefits have grown stingier, and job security has shriveled.Going behind the scenes, Steven Greenhouse tells the stories of software engineers in Seattle, hotel housekeepers in Chicago, call center workers in New York, and janitors in Houston, as he explores why, in the world\u2019s most affluent nation, so many corporations are intent on squeezing their workers dry. We meet all kinds of workers: white collar and blue collar, high tech and low tech, middle income and low income; employees who stock shelves during a hurricane while locked inside their store, get fired after suffering debilitating injuries on the job, face egregious sexual harassment, and get laid off when their companies move high-tech operations abroad. We also meet young workers having a hard time starting out and seventy-year-old workers with too little money saved up to retire.The book explains how economic, business, political, and social trends\u2014among them globalization, the influx of immigrants, and the Wal-Mart effect\u2014have fueled the squeeze. We see how the social contract between employers and employees, guaranteeing steady work and good pensions, has eroded over the last three decades, damaged by massive layoffs of factory and office workers and Wall Street\u2019s demands for ever-higher profits. In short, the post\u2013World War II social contract that helped build the world\u2019s largest and most prosperous middle class has been replaced by a startling contradiction: corporate profits, economic growth, and worker productivity have grown strongly while worker pay has languished and Americans face ever-greater pressures to work harder and longer.Greenhouse also examines companies that are generous to their workers and can serve as models for all of corporate America: Costco, Patagonia, and the casino-hotels of Las Vegas among them.  Finally, he presents a series of pragmatic, ready-to-be-implemented suggestions on what government, business, and labor should do to alleviate the squeeze.A balanced, consistently revealing exploration of a major American crisis.",

Just another case of turf warfare.At least that's what it looks like on the surface to Seattle investigator J. P. Beaumont, who's been handed the assignment under the strictest confidence. But as Beau starts digging, the situation becomes more complicated than he'd thought. It appears that LaShawn really had turned over a new leaf at the King Street Mission and his murder was premeditated. Someone had targeted the man for death.Meanwhile, Beau's lover and fellow cop, Mel Soames, is given her own hush-hush investigation. A routine check on registered sex offenders has revealed a disturbing pattern: they're dying off at an alarming rate, and not all due to natural causes. Details of the latest death suggest an inside job, and Mel isn't letting this go. Suddenly, Mel's investigation becomes entangled with Beau's, and the two begin to uncover a nightmarish conspiracy that could involve people in high places\u2014including their own top brass.",

Before purchasing, borrowing, or stealing this book, you should be aware that it contains the answers to some of those questions, such as the following: 1. Who is Lemony? 2. Is there a secret organization I should know about? 3. Why does Lemony Snicket spend his time researching and writing distressing books concerning the Baudelaire orphans? 4. Why do all of Lemony Snicket's books contain a sad dedication to a woman named Beatrice? 5. If there's nothing out there, what was that noise? Our advice to you is that you find a book that answers less upsetting questions than this one. Perhaps your librarian, bookseller, or parole officer can recommend a book that answers the question, \"Aren't ponies adorable?\"",

But one day death announces itself to him, and to his shocked surprise he is brought face to face with his own mortality. How, Tolstoy asks, does an unreflective man confront his one and only moment of truth?This short novel was the artistic culmination of a profound spiritual crisis in Tolstoy's life, a nine-year period following the publication of Anna Karenina during which he wrote not a word of fiction. A thoroughly absorbing and, at times, terrifying glimpse into the abyss of death, it is also a strong testament to the possibility of finding spiritual salvation.",

        "Title": "IF THIS HOUSE COULD TALK...: Historic Homes, Extraordinary Americans",
        "Authors": "By Brownstein, Elizabeth Smith",
        "Description": "Abraham Lincoln once remarked that \"the strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.\" Author Elizabeth Smith Brownstein, former Director of Research for the Emmy Award-winning series Smithsonian World, proves him right and gives new meaning to the old saying \"If these walls could talk...\" In this book they do, and the stories they tell are fascinating.  The result of an intensive nationwide search that took the author across deserts and plains, into ghost towns, legendary mansions, and secret compartments, If This House Could Talk...opens the doors to some of America's most significant, surprising houses and to the lives of the extraordinary men and women whose stories they tell: from the only house in America with a throne room, where a doomed monarch ruled for just two years, to a beloved poet's simple New Hampshire farm; from a rare and remote plantation complex built by America's greatest architect to the multicolored mansion of an Indian chief; from the house of an innocent victim, of the Salem witch trials in 1692 to the only house our greatest president ever owned.  What stories lie hidden behind the gleaming facade of a quintessential antebellum plantation house? What was it about a small green house that infuriated its neighbors and helped change the face of modern architecture? What do a 250-room chateau built for a bachelor and an overcrowded Lower East Side tenement both say about the persistence of the American Dream? In thought-provoking, anecdotal essays, the author considers these questions and more as she explores such themes as the struggle for equality, the role of women in culture and politics, public skepticism toward government, and the place of art in everyday life. Over 200 specially commissioned and archival photographs combine with her essays to bring to life major episodes in American history and people who have shaped American culture and institutions.  Based on privileged access to private and public homes, rare documents, unpublished diaries, oral histories, and interviews of noted scholars and curators, If This House Could Talk...surprises and moves as it examines the myths and realities and conveys the richness and drama of the American experience.",

        "Description": "Virgil Flowers-tall, lean, late thirties, three times divorced, hair way too long for a cop's-had kicked around for a while before joining the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. First, it was the army and the military police, then the police in St. Paul, and finally Lucas Davenport had brought him into the BCA, promising him, \"We'll only give you the hard stuff.\"  He'd been doing the hard stuff for three years now-but never anything like this. In the small town of Bluestem, where everybody knows everybody, a house way up on a ridge explodes into flames, its owner, a man named Judd, trapped inside. There is a lot of reason to hate him, Flowers discovers. Years ago, Judd had perpetrated a scam that'd driven a lot of local farmers out of business, even to suicide. There are also rumors swirling around: of some very dicey activities with other men's wives; of involvement with some nutcase religious guy; of an out-of-wedlock daughter. In fact, Flowers concludes, you'd probably have to dig around to find a person who didn't despise him.  And that wasn't even the reason Flowers had come to Bluestem. Three weeks before, there'd been another murder-two, in fact-a doctor and his wife, the doctor found propped up in his backyard, both eyes shot out. There hadn't been a murder in Bluestem in years-and now, suddenly, three? Flowers knows two things: This wasn't a coincidence, and this had to be personal.  But just how personal is something even he doesn't realize, and may not find out until too late. Because the next victim . . .may be himself.  Filled with the audacious plotting, rich characters, and brilliant suspense that have always made his books \"compulsively readable\" (Los Angeles Times), Dark of the Moon is vintage Sandford, further proof that he \"is in a class of his own\" (The Orlando Sentinel).",

        "Title": "The Chicago Manual of Style: The Essential Guide for Writers, Editors, and Publishers (14th Edition)",
        "Authors": "By Chicago Editorial Staff",
        "Description": "Here is the thoroughly revised and updated edition of the one essential reference for all who work with words - writers, editors, proof-readers, indexers, copywriters, designers, and publishers.Almost 200 pages longer than its predecessor, this edition reflects nearly every significant change in style, usage, procedure, and technology. It is easier to use, richer in illustrative examples, and informed everywhere by the presence of computers in publishing, from manuscript preparation to editing, typesetting, indexing, design, and printing.The result of more than a decade's worth of continuous editing and revision, the changes to this edition fall into two broad categories.First are the changes designed to make the Manual's editorial guidelines more systematic, more inclusive, more reflective of contemporary usage, and more accessible. There are major revisions in the chapter on quotations, which features a fuller discussion of speech and alternative punctuation; in the chapter on names and terms, expanded treatment of nationalities, tribes, and races; a reorganized chapter on foreign languages, with a new section on Hebrew; and a revised and enlarged tabular spelling guide for compound words and words with prefixes and suffixes.The most thoroughly revised portion of the Manual is the section on documentation. What was scattered across three chapters is now more logically and concisely presented in two. Chapter 15 now covers the humanities style of documentation, and chapter 16, the author-date style preferred in the natural and social sciences. Notes and bibliographic entries, text citations and reference-list entries are discussed separately, and there are many examples of ways to cite a range of material - from medieval documents to computer programs, with guidelines for citing data bases, network billboards, and other electronic documents.The other set of changes emphasizes new developments in publishing, from new technologies for composition, design, printing, and binding, to the shifting responsibilities of author and editor in an age of personal computers. For first-time and self-publishing authors, there is also new information about the outside of the book: jackets, covers, and how to obtain and display ISBN numbers and bar codes.The chapter on copyrights and permissions has been rewritten by attorney William Strong to cover current laws, practices, and procedures, with a more substantial section on interpreting the concept of fair use.The bibliography and glossary have also been extensively revised.This revision process has been guided by a set of basic principles: consistency, clarity, literacy, good sense, and good usage, all of them tempered by a respect for the author's individuality of expression. These principles have worked successfully at the Press for a century; constantly renewed, they are what makes the Manual the authoritative voice of publishing. There is no other reference so valued or so necessary.",
