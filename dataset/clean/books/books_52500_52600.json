        "Description": "In The Late Great USA, Jerome Corsi argues that the benignly-named Security and Prosperity Partnership, created at a meeting between George W. Bush, Stephen Harper and Vincente Fox, is in fact the same kind of regional integration plan that led Europe to form the EU. According to Corsi, the elites in Europe behind the EU knew that it would be necessary to conceal from the peoples of Europe what was being done in their name until the process was so far advanced that it had become irreversible. Could the same thing be happening here? Is American sovereignty doomed? \u00a0 Using dozens of documents secured through the Freedom of Information Act and his trademark hard-hitting interviews, Corsi sets out a chilling view of America&#39;s possible harmonized future - one being created covertly, without voter input or Congressional oversight. Could our government&#39;s unfathomable position on illegal immigration be tied to the prospect of an integrated North American Union?",

This highly accomplished first novel resonates with ideas, impassioned lyricism, and poignant historical detail as it captures an essential part of the African-American experience in our century.",

        "Description": "As the words holo (complete) and gram (message) connote, the hologram captures the entire message of a scene in all its visual properties, including the realism of three dimensions. It involves the simple process of photographically recording the pattern formed by two interfering sets of light waves, one of these sets being a reference wave. With the introduction of lasers to holography in 1963, real advances in the development of holography began to take place.Dr. Kock's lucid introduction to lasers and holography has now been revised and updated for a second edition. It begins with a clear discussion of wave patterns and coherence. Then the development of lasers is summarized, along with the phenomenon of wave diffraction. Finally, the important subjects of zone plates and the properties of holograms are skillfully described. A new, concluding chapter brings the story up to the present, with a survey of recent advances in such areas as viewing holograms, hologram computer memories, liquid surface holography, synthetic-aperture radar and sonar, large new lasers, fiber optics, etc. Using language that can be readily understood by high school and junior high school students, Dr. Kock has written a brief, yet authoritative volume that should satisfy anyone's curiosity about this burgeoning field. The remarkable discoveries that have already occurred are only a prelude to an even more remarkable future. 84 illustrations, including 8 new to this edition. New preface. Suggested (1981) additional reading. Index.",

For the last three decades, as president of the United States and as founder of The Carter Center, he has studied the complex and interrelated issues of the region's conflicts and has been actively involved in reconciling them. He knows the leaders of all factions in the region who will need to play key roles, and he sees encouraging signs among them.Carter describes the history of previous peace efforts and why they fell short. He argues persuasively that the road to a peace agreement is now open and that it has broad international and regional support. Most of all, since there will be no progress without courageous and sustained U.S. leadership, he says the time for progress is now. President Barack Obama is committed to a personal effort to exert that leadership, starting early in his administration.This is President Carter's call for action, and he lays out a practical and doable path to peace.",

        "Description": "From the reign of Peter the Great, Russia's country estates were oases of barbarian splendor and personal freedom in a vast, sparsely settled, and authoritarian land. This lavishly illustrated book is the first in any language to explore fully the vanished world of the Russian country estate. Priscilla Roosevelt brings to life these magnificent aristocratic dwellings, discussing their origins, their design and decoration, the social, family, and cultural life within their walls, and their physical demise after the 1917 revolution.The Bolshevik revolution destroyed both the world of the estate and much of the evidence about it. To recreate this lost world Roosevelt has drawn on many sources - including the physical remains of once-grand manor houses (many photographed for this book), the invaluable diaries and memoirs that chronicle a way of life that was to perish, and the Russian art and literature that estate life produced and in which it was portrayed. Juxtaposing images from art and from the novels of such literary giants as Turgenev and Tolstoy with the real milieu that inspired them, the book is a beautiful and vivid portrait of Russian country life.",

        "Title": "The Arts: A History of Expression in the 20th Century (Twentieth Century History Series)",
        "Authors": "By Tamplin, Ronald (EDT)",
        "Description": "Seventy years ago the Dada movement proclaimed, \"Art is dead\"; if so, it has had an exciting afterlife.  The twentieth-century world of art has boiled with rebellion and experiment, each generation creating new forms of expression--from Cubism to abstract expressionism, from surrealism to superrealism, not to mention the new trends in literature, architecture, music, and dance.  The Arts offers a sweeping look at this tumultuous, creative century, in a richly illustrated and accessibly written volume.      With over 300 illustrations, many in full color, The Arts ranges across every field of fine art, painting a vivid portrait of the changing styles--and the money, politics, and intellectual trends that have shaped twentieth-century art.  Unlike so many histories, this comprehensive narrative brings together both the visual and the performing arts, presenting an integrated picture of our century's changing ideas and artistic fashions.  The Arts describes modernism in literature (Eliot, Pound, and Joyce) alonside modernism in architecture (Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Bauhaus movement), and explores how artists from sculptors to musicians have responded to major political events.  And at a time when public debate is raging over public support for \"obscene\" art, this book delves into the social reality behind creative work.  The authors examine social standards and politics, and discuss the rise of powerful institutions in the U.S. and Europe--such as New York's Museum of Modern Art, various national theaters, the National Endowment for the Arts, the British Arts Council, and prestigious arts centers--as well as the impact of state support and the superheated art market.  The Arts comes right up to the present moment, exploring postmodern architecture, the conceptualist rebellion against art itself, and the death of the radical avant garde.  And throughout, scores of informatively captioned capsule biographies bring the works and personalities of twentieth-century art to life.      The world of art is fast-paced and exciting, a world where ideas and influences never stop changing.  The Arts, with its expansive scope and accessible format, brings this fascinating subject into pespective, vividly portraying the development of fine arts ina century when styles and tastes have been turned upside down again and again and again.",

As the lead singer of U2, Bono has sold 130 million albums, won fourteen Grammys, and played numerous sold-out world tours, but he has also lobbied and worked with world leaders from Bill Clinton and George W. Bush to Nelson Mandela on debt relief, AIDS, and other critical global issues. He has collaborated with the same musicians for nearly three decades and has been married to his childhood sweetheart since 1982. His life, at all turns, resists the rock star clich\u00e9s.  In a series of intimate conversations with his friend Michka Assayas, a music journalist who has been with the band since the very beginning, Bono reflects on his transformation from the extrovert singer of a small Irish post-punk band into one of the most famous individuals in the world; and from an international celebrity to an influential spokesperson for the Third World. He speaks candidly about his faith, family, commitment, influences, service, and passion. Bono: A Self-Portrait in Conversation is the closest we will come, for now, to a memoir from the iconic frontman of U2.",

        "Description": "From the perilous ocean crossing to the shared bounty of the first Thanksgiving, the Pilgrim settlement of New England has become enshrined as our most sacred national myth. Yet, as bestselling author Nathaniel Philbrick reveals in his spellbinding new book, the true story of the Pilgrims is much more than the well-known tale of piety and sacrifice; it is a fifty-five-year epic that is at once tragic, heroic, exhilarating, and profound.   The Mayflower's religious refugees arrived in Plymouth Harbor during a period of crisis for Native Americans as disease spread by European fishermen devastated their populations. Initially the two groups\u2014the Wampanoags, under the charismatic and calculating chief Massasoit, and the Pilgrims, whose pugnacious military officer Miles Standish was barely five feet tall\u2014maintained a fragile working relationship. But within decades, New England would erupt into King Philip's War, a savagely bloody conflict that nearly wiped out English colonists and natives alike and forever altered the face of the fledgling colonies and the country that would grow from them.   With towering figures like William Bradford and the distinctly American hero Benjamin Church at the center of his narrative, Philbrick has fashioned a fresh and compelling portrait of the dawn of American history\u2014a history dominated right from the start by issues of race, violence, and religion.",

        "Description": "The world is about to leave the relatively happy era of abundant cheap oil and enter into a long emergency in which peaking oil production will interact with other looming environmental and economic difficulties to effectively bring an end to civilization as currently constituted, argues Kunstler (a former editor at Rolling Stone). After describing the likely depletion of oil production in the very near future, he considers how it will interact with oil-driven geopolitics and attempts to burst any bubbles about the possibility of switching the economy to alternative fuels. He then considers looming environmental issues of climate change, epidemic disease, water scarcity, and habitat destruction, as well as the \"entropic mess that our economy has become,\" as part and parcel of the story of the development of oil-based industrialism and its coming end. After describing the chilling political, social, and economic consequences of the end of oil-based industrialism, he considers how Americans should react to the coming disaster, arguing that life will have to become more intensely local, that the economy will have to be structured around food production, that land will have to be reallocated in terms of purpose and ownership (involving the dismantling of suburbia), and people may have to cope with the regional breakup of the United States.

        "Authors": "By Wilson, William Julius",
        "Description": "Wilson, one of our foremost authorities on race and poverty, challenges decades of liberal and conservative pieties to look squarely at the devastating effects that joblessness has had on our urban ghettos. Marshaling a vast array of data and the personal stories of hundreds of men and women, Wilson persuasively argues that problems endemic to America's inner cities--from fatherless households to drugs and violent crime--stem directly from the disappearance of blue-collar jobs in the wake of a globalized economy. Wilson's achievement is to portray this crisis as one that affects all Americans, and to propose solutions whose benefits would be felt across our society. At a time when welfare is ending and our country's racial dialectic is more strained than ever, When Work Disappears is a sane, courageous, and desperately important work.\"Wilson is the keenest liberal analyst of the most perplexing of all American problems...[This book is] more ambitious and more accessible than anything he has done before.\"--The New Yorker",

        "Title": "World War IV: The Long Struggle Against Islamofascism",
        "Authors": "By Podhoretz, Norman",
        "Description": "For almost half a century\u2014as a magazine editor and as the author of numerous bestselling books and hundreds of articles\u2014Norman Podhoretz has helped drive the central political and intellectual debates in this country. Now, in this beautifully written and powerfully argued book, he\u00a0takes on the most controversial issue of our time\u2014the war against the global network of terrorists that attacked us on 9/11.\u00a0In World War IV, Podhoretz makes the first serious effort to set 9/11 itself, the battles that have followed it in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the war of ideas that it has provoked at home into a broad historical context. Through a brilliant telling of this epic story, Podhoretz shows that the global war against Islamofascism is as vital and necessary as the two world wars and the cold war (\u201cWorld War III\u201d) by which it was preceded. He also lays out a compelling case in defense of the Bush Doctrine, contending that its new military strategy of preemption and its new political strategy of democratization represent the only viable way to fight and win the special kind of war into which we were suddenly plunged.\u00a0Different in certain respects though the Islamofascists are from their totalitarian predecessors, this new enemy is equally dedicated to the destruction of the freedoms for which America stands and by which it lives. But it took the blatant aggression of 9/11 to make most Americans realize that war had long since been declared on us and that the time had come to fight back. Past administrations, both Republican and Democratic, had failed to respond with appropriate force to attacks by Muslim terrorists on American citizens in various countries, and even the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 was treated as a criminal act rather than an act of war. All this changed after 9/11, when the whole country rallied around President Bush\u2019s decision to bring the war to the enemy\u2019s home ground in the Middle East.\u00a0The successes and the setbacks that have followed are vividly portrayed by Podhoretz, who goes on to argue that, just as in the two great struggles against totalitarianism in the twentieth century, the key to victory in World War IV will be a willingness to endure occasional reverses without losing sight of what we are fighting against, what we are fighting for, and why we have to win.",

The goal of this text is to place an understanding of the developing world city in its wider global context. First, this is done by developing the concept of social surplus product as a key to understanding the character of the contemporary Third World city. Second, throughout this text, the city in developing areas is centrally placed in the context of global, social, economic, political and cultural change. Thus, the important themes of globalisation, modernity and postmodernity are examined both in relation to the structure of sets of towns and cities which make up the national or regional urban system, and in respect of ideas and concepts dealing with the morphology, structure and social patterning of individual urban areas.The City in the Developing World is a core text for second and third year undergraduates in the fields of geography, development studies, planning, economics and the social sciences, taking options which deal with development issues, development theory, gender and development and Third World development.",

Taking a philosophical view, Trillin has said, \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to know whether you could bring down a presidency with iambic pentameter until somebody tried it.\u201dNow Trillin is trying again, back at his pithy and hilarious best to comment on the President\u2019s decision to go to war in Iraq (\u201cThen terrorists could count on what we\u2019d do: / Attack us, we\u2019ll strike back, though not at you\u201d), his religiosity (\u201cHe treats his critics in the press / As if they\u2019re yapping Pekineses. / Reporters deal in mundane facts; / This man has got the word from Jesus\u201d), and whether he was wearing a transmitting device in the first presidential debate (\u201cCould this explain his odd expressions? Is there proof he / Was being told, \u2018If you can hear me now, look goofy\u2019?\u201d)Trillin deals with the people around Bush, such as Nanny Dick Cheney and Mushroom Cloud Rice and Orange John Ashcroft and Orange John\u2019s successor, Alberto Gonzales (\u201cThe A.G.\u2019s to be one Alberto Gonzales\u2013 / Dependable, actually loyal \u00fcber alles\u201d).

        "Description": "Probably the most infamous story in the Sherlock Holmes canon is \u201cThe Final Problem\u201d as it relates the facts of the death/murder of the master detective at Reichenbach Falls. On May 4, 1891, the detective met his archenemy Professor Moriarty on a ledge above the falls; the two became locked in a titanic hand-to-hand struggle before both tumbled over the precipice, presumably to their deaths, as witnessed afar by Dr.Watson. The outcry against the death of such a popular character was so great that in 1901 Conan Doyle was forced to give in to the pressure of his fan mail. He resurrected the detective by claiming that Holmes had managed to grab a tuft of grass during the fall into the \u201cdreadful cauldron\u201d and so had lived to solve another mystery.But what really happened that infamous day at Reichenbach Falls and why did Holmes disappear in the aftermath? And what of the infamous Moriarty? How did a noble mathematician become the Napoleon of Crime?The Shadow of Reichenbach Falls provides these answers and more. It turns out that the events were not just witnessed by Watson but by another young detective of the Victorian era\u2014Carnacki the Ghost Finder. Carnacki rescues an amnesiac gentleman from the base of the falls only to find himself and his companion doggedly pursued by an evil mastermind whose shadowy powers may reach from the bloody crime scenes of White Chapel to far beyond the grave.Filled with Holmesian lore and thrilling encounters evocative of Doyle\u2019s work in the Strand magazine, The Shadow of Reichenbach Falls will undoubtedly join the ranks of such successful Holmesian pastiches as The Seven Percent Solution, The West End Horror, and Murder by Decree.",

        "Description": "\"With a mood akin to WUTHERING HEIGHTS--and indeed the spirit of Emily Bronte\" (Irish Times), Edna O'Brien's critically acclaimed novel WILD DECEMBERS charts the quick but sure demise of relations between \"the warring sons of warring sons.\" Here in the countryside of western Ireland, \"ancient feuds, romantic passions, and misguided ideas of fidelity blend together in . . . [a] heartbreaking story\" (Wall Street Journal) leavened by the human comedy of which O'Brien rarely loses sight. A sister, a brother, and a stranger converge in a classic triangle, proceeding inevitably \"toward a climax that is Irish to the quick, violent and sad and, in a strange way, beautiful. Just like the novel itself\" (Washington Post).     WILD DECEMBERS is a triumphant work from a writer who wears well the mantle of her Irish forebears and yet who, with each new novel, breaks new ground all her own. In this, her latest, \"readers could not ask for a more profoundly satisfying book\" (Boston Herald).",

Soon recognized as a cryptographer of genius, he became head of communications at the Special Operations Executive (SOE), where he revolutionized the codemaking techniques of the Allies and trained some of the most famous agents dropped into occupied Europe, including \"the White Rabbit\" and Violette Szabo. As a top codemaker, Marks had a unique perspective on one of the most fascinating and, until now, little-known aspects of the Second World War.  Writing with the narrative flair and vivid characterization of his famous screenplays, Marks gives free rein to his keen sense of the absurd and his wry wit, resulting in a thrilling and poignant memoir that celebrates individual courage and endeavor, without losing sight of the human cost and horror of war.",
