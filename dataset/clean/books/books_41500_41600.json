        "Title": "Nature's Medicine: Plants that Heal: A chronicle of mankind's search for healing plants through the ages",
        "Authors": "By Swerdlow, Joel L. and Johnson, Lynn (PHT)",
        "Description": "For thousands of years -- indeed, for all of human history except for the past 50 to 70 years in Western societies -- plants have been our chief source of medicine. The fascinating story that unfolds in the pages of this book is much more than a catalog of natural cures. Equal parts scientific inquiry and cultural history, it's nothing less than a chronicle of the healer's art as it evolved from folk remedies to modern science. It's also an account of humanity's continuing quest to discover new medicines and to unravel the complex and often deeply mysterious interactions between the biochemistry of plants and the human body.  From the doctor-philosophers of classical antiquity to the shamans of today's rain forests, healers have prescribed a multitude of cures culled from the flora around them, and in many societies these ancient treatments are still in everyday use. In India, for example, Ayurvedic physicians continue a tradition first codified in written form many centuries before the birth of Christ. The origins of Chinese medicine are similarly shrouded in myth, but its effectiveness has been proved time and time again although the reasons why frequently remain elusive. And in many cases, Western medicine has been too quick to reject as \"old wives' tales\" the lessons learned and refined over countless generations.  In Nature's Medicine you'll learn how a malaria-stricken Spanish countess was cured by the bark of a Peruvian tree, the source of what we now call quinine, and how 18th-century doctors used digitalis for all sorts of ills -- but, ironically, not for heart disease. You'll discover that few natural compounds have been used as the basis for modern pharmaceutical drugs but that many have served as molecular templates for proprietary synthetic formulas. And you'll see how ancient theories based on different views of the human body can lead to surprisingly effective medicines.  Featuring some 200 full-color photographs, period illustrations from old medical texts, and watercolors illustrating a catalog of 102 healing herbs, Nature's Medicine is at once a vivid historical chronicle, a valuable compendium of healers' lore, and a revealing excursion into the world of plants whose power to cure has been known for millennia but is only beginning to be understood.",

That it can lift your mood, clear your head and give you perspective? Now what about 101 of the most uplifting stories you've ever read about people reaching out, stepping up and transforming their lives and the world around them?    At Chicken Soup for the Soul, we know that a story can change your heart. It can touch your mind. It can free your soul. The moment might be as simple as a small child giving water to a dog on a hot day or as heart-wrenching as a parent responding with love to the murder of their child. It might be as common as a class of poor immigrants giving their young instructor a new coat she needed but couldn't afford; as life changing as an unruly student learning to love math because of a dedicated teacher; as satisfying as someone apologizing for a hurtful action of several years before; or as monumental as the international work of Jimmy Carter and Oscar Arias, former President of Costa Rica.As these stories so wonderful illustrate, the power to change starts with you, but it doesn't end there. When we change one heart at a time-our own and then those around us-we create a better world. We hope these stories will touch and change your heart today.",

        "Description": "Beneath the holy mountain Croagh Patrick, in damp and lovely County Mayo, sits the small, sheltered village of Ballinacroagh. To the exotic Aminpour sisters, Ireland looks like a much-needed safe haven. It has been seven years since Marjan Aminpour fled Iran with her younger sisters, Bahar and Layla, and she hopes that in Ballinacroagh, a land of \u201ccrazed sheep and dizzying roads,\u201d they might finally find a home.From the kitchen of an old pastry shop on Main Mall, the sisters set about creating a Persian oasis. Soon sensuous wafts of cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron float through the streets\u2013an exotic aroma that announces the opening of the Babylon Caf\u00e9, and a shock to a town that generally subsists on boiled cabbage and Guinness served at the local tavern. And it is an affront to the senses of Ballinacroagh\u2019s uncrowned king, Thomas McGuire. After trying to buy the old pastry shop for years and failing, Thomas is enraged to find it occupied\u2013and by foreigners, no less. But the mysterious, spicy fragrances work their magic on the townsfolk, and soon, business is booming. Marjan is thrilled with the demand for her red lentil soup, abgusht stew, and rosewater baklava\u2013and with the transformation in her sisters. Young Layla finds first love, and even tense, haunted Bahar seems to be less nervous. And in the stand-up-comedian-turned-priest Father Fergal Mahoney, the gentle, lonely widow Estelle Delmonico, and the headstrong hairdresser Fiona Athey, the sisters find a merry band of supporters against the close-minded opposition of less welcoming villagers stuck in their ways. But the idyll is soon broken when the past rushes back to threaten the Amnipours once more, and the lives they left behind in revolution-era Iran bleed into the present.  Infused with the textures and scents, trials and triumph,s of two distinct cultures, Pomegranate Soup is an infectious novel of magical realism. This richly detailed story, highlighted with delicious recipes, is a delectable journey into the heart of Persian cooking and Irish living.",

In his work as a Miami crime scene investigator, Dexter Morgan is accustomed to seeing evil deeds\u2026particularly because, on occasion, he rather enjoys committing them himself. Guided by his Dark Passenger (the reptilian voice inside him), he lives his outwardly normal life adhering to one simple rule: he kills only very bad people. Dexter slides through life undetected, working as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, helping his fianc\u00e9 raise her two adorable (if somewhat\u2026unique) children, and always planning his next jaunt as Dexter the Dark Avenger under the light of the full moon. But then everything changes. Dexter is called to a crime scene that seems routine: a gruesome double homicide at the university campus, which Dexter would normally investigate with gusto, before enjoying a savory lunch. And yet this scene feels terribly wrong. Dexter\u2019s Dark Passenger senses something it recognizes, something utterly chilling, and the Passenger\u2014mastermind of Dexter\u2019s homicidal prowess\u2014promptly goes into hiding.With his Passenger on the run, Dexter is left to face this case all alone\u2014not to mention his demanding sister (Sergeant Deborah), his frantic fianc\u00e9e (Rita), and the most frightening wedding caterer ever to plan a menu. Equally unsettling, Dexter begins to realize that something very dark and very powerful has its sights set on him. Dexter is left in the dark, but he must summon his sharpest investigative instincts not only to pursue his enemy, but to locate and truly understand his Dark Passenger. To find him, Dexter has to research the questions he\u2019s never dared ask: Who is the Dark Passenger, and where does he come from? It is nothing less than a search for Dexter\u2019s own dark soul\u2026fueled by a steady supply of fresh doughnuts.Macabre, ironic, and wonderfully entertaining, Dexter in the Dark goes deeper into the psyche of one of the freshest protagonists in recent fiction. Jeff Lindsay\u2019s glorious creativity is on full display in his most accomplished novel yet.",

In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within.Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police.Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",

And one that I ultimately had to leave.\" Trained to become a geisha from the age of five, Iwasaki would live among the other \"women of art\" in Kyoto's Gion Kobu district and practice the ancient customs of Japanese entertainment. She was loved by kings, princes, military heroes, and wealthy statesmen alike. But even though she became one of the most prized geishas in Japan's history, Iwasaki wanted more: her own life. And by the time she retired at age twenty-nine, Iwasaki was finally on her way toward a new beginning. Geisha, a Life is her story -- at times heartbreaking, always awe-inspiring, and totally true.",

Beautifully wrought, deeply affecting, Moon Women is a resounding portrait of three generations of remarkable women, separated by a secret only one of them can tell.In the lush North Carolina foothills, the Moon women have put down roots: matriarch Marvelle Moon, who\u2019s starting to lose her grip on the world after more than eighty years of life; her middle-aged daughters, Ruth Ann and Cassandra; and Ruth Ann\u2019s nineteen-year-old daughter, Ashley, fresh out of rehab, unmarried, and three months pregnant.Despite Ruth Ann\u2019s best efforts to live a life that\u2019s all her own, her family is coming together around her. Marvelle and Ashley need a place to live and Ruth Ann is unable to turn either of them away; and her womanizing ex-husband has been coming around again, dredging up the past. Now a flurry of outbursts, emotions, and outrages is shattering Ruth Ann\u2019s separate peace. And as this flawed family comes together, so, too, do the stories of the people Ruth Ann thought she knew best.For here is Ashley, who has spent nineteen years running furiously away from home, now finding herself on a strange journey with her unraveling grandmother. And here is Cassandra, protected by layers of obesity and loneliness, wondering how to put magic back in her life. And Marvelle, slowly losing touch with reality, privately contemplating the story of her life and the secret that would change everything for everyone \u2014 if they only knew....By turns fierce and tender, harrowing and heartbreaking, Moon Women resonates with emotional power, holding us captive under its beguiling spell. It is an astonishing debut from a powerfully original new voice in contemporary fiction.",
