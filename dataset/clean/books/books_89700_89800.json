        "Description": "America's Conversation with FDRFor readers of The Greatest Generation, an extraordinary window on the '30s and '40s By the time FDR took his oath of office on March 4, 1933, Americans had been in the depths of the Great Depression for four years. One week later, the President gave the first of what would be thirty-one Fireside Chats.MacArthur Award-winning historian Lawrence W. Levine and independent scholar Cornelia Levine have combed through the millions of letters that flooded the White House in response to the Chats. Grateful, infuriated, proud, scolding, the letters, collected here and combined with the Levines' vivid historical commentary, give testimony to an extraordinary time in our nation's past.Encouraged by the President (\"Tell me your troubles\"), farmers, salesmen, housewives, new immigrants, and old Republicans all wrote, telling him about their lives and what they thought of his initiatives. Their words paint a remarkable picture of America, from the hardship of the Depression, to the promise of the New Deal, to the turmoil surrounding our nation's entry into World War II.Praise for Lawrence W. Levine:\"One of our era's most original historians.\"          \u2014Henry Louis Gates, Jr.\"A master of American history.\"           \u2014Mike Davis, author of City of Quartz",

        "Description": "(Playbill Broadway Yearbook). Many of the people who work on Broadway keep scrapbooks of their experiences: photos, signed posters, ticket stubs, and, of course the Playbills. Playbill Books, a division of the iconic 111-year-old company that designs the programs for every show on Broadway, has expanded this idea into a new project that it hopes will become a Broadway institution:  The Playbill Broadway Yearbook . It takes the form of a high school or college yearbook, packed with photos and memorabilia from the entire 2004-2005 season. This inaugural edition will include chapters on every show that ran during the season   not just the new shows, but the long-running ones from seasons past as well. In addition to all the headshots of all the actors who appeared in Playbill, the book will have photos of producers, writers, designers, stage managers, stagehands and musicians. The goal is to include as many of the faces that worked on Broadway and who made themselves available.

        "Description": "Want to decorate like a millionaire? You can--even without a lot of money. All it takes is a well-chosen focal point, that one special something, to make an entire room look newly and expensively designed. If you know what you like, but can't always put your finger on it till you see it, open up and dip into these dozens of marvelously photographed ideas, all selected with comfort, taste, need, and lifestyle in mind. Think about the effect of an unusual wall treatment, or an eye-catcher prominently displayed on a shelf: people's attention will jump right over to that object. And, when they leave, they'll remember the rest of the room being equally beautiful and imaginatively done. One way to achieve this magic is to use something you already have for a different purpose--a candle sconce as a hanging plant holder or a metal shelf as a drapery valence. Page after fabulous page demonstrates how small touches--even the way your bathroom towels are folded and hung on the bar--make an enormous difference, on the wall, the table, the mantle, the bed...everywhere, indoors and out!",

He is more than happy to return the favors by silencing four men awaiting trial in a sensational case against organized crime. Special Agent George Baker is the man who has assembled the evidence to put those same four men away for life. When one is knifed under the watchful eye of a policeman outside a New York courtroom, and another is found slumped over a Las Vegas gaming table, Baker enters a cat-and-mouse game to entrap Cardinali before his whole case is destroyed.But for Baker's adversary, it is the sting of the stiletto as it sinks into another human being that keeps Cesare Cardinali killing - not the debt he presumes to owe to the Mafia kingpin. And once he has begun to savor that encompassing rush, nobody - friend, enemy, or mistress - is likely to stop him from knowing it again.",

They were ferocious eaters and talkers, devouring rumors and innuendo with gusto. Food was their common language, and everyone understood the dialects.\" -- Aunt Tempe, reminiscing about family dinnersFrom Michael Lee West, author of the acclaimed American Pie, She Flew the Coop, and Crazy Ladies, comes a delightfully quirky memoir of an adventurous food-obsessed life, laced with delicious secret recipes passed from generation to generation. Wonderfully presented and thoroughly entertaining, this warm and witty work unites West's evocative voice and humor with the uniquely American form of kitchen tales in the tradition of Laurie Colwin.West lends her distinctive humor and often hilarious insights to stories about her trials and tribulations as a Southern woman who became an \"accidental gourmet.\" In this irresistible memoir mothers swing from chandeliers, elderly aunts brew love potions, a South American nymphomaniac stirs up trouble at a Louisiana barbecue joint, Margaret Mitchell's bed is discovered during a routine antique hunt, a cabbage-eating ghost haunts relatives, mother and daughter peek under fig leaves on statues, and bees attack--all in pursuit of good food.By watching a multitude of relatives cook, squabble, and carry on tradition, Michael Lee West went from a noncooking student to a full-on gourmet of food and words. Using her own experience and the witticisms of relatives, or clever inspirations overheard in parking lots on the way to the mayor's funeral, West fills these pages with insights such as: \"Potato salad is our friend. It will never let you down. It's a shame we have to eat it, but that's life\" and \"Live and learn. Die and get food. That's the Southern way.\" Often bawdy and always entertaining, West is wonderfully outrageous, charming, and delightful. \"Anybody can cook. But it takes a special person to feed the souls of her guests.\"-- Miss Johnnie, sitting in a rocking chair, musing about hospitality, 1979",
