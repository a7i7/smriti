        "Description": "It's the summer of 1960 in Atkinson, Vermont. Maria Fermoyle is a strong but vulnerable divorced woman whose loneliness and ambition for her children make her easy prey for dangerous con man Omar Duvall. Marie's children are Alice, seventeen\u2014involved with a young priest; Norm, sixteen\u2014hotheaded and idealistic; and Benny, twelve\u2014isolated and misunderstood, and so desperate for his mother's happiness that he hides the deadly truth he knows about Duvall. We also meet Sam Fermoyle, the children's alcoholic father; Sam's brother-in-law, who makes anonymous \"love\" calls from the bathroom of his failing appliance store; and the Klubock family, who\u2014in contrast to the Fermoyles\u2014live an orderly life in the house next door.Songs in Ordinary Time is a masterful epic of the everyday, illuminating the kaleidoscope of lives that tell the compelling story of this unforgettably family.",

        "Description": "The Simple Science of a Happy FamilyFrom raising children to getting along with in-laws, what do people with close and loving families do differently than those with strained or unfulfilling relationships? Sociologists, therapists, and psychiatrists have spent entire careers investigating the ins and outs of family dynamics, yet their findings are inaccessible to ordinary people, hidden in obscure journals to be shared with other experts. Now, David Niven, the international bestselling author of The 100 Simple Secret series has collected the most current and significant data from more than a thousand of the best scientific studies on families and then spelled out the findings in plain English.The advice is based not on one person's unique experiences or opinions, but offers for the first time the research of noted scientists studying average American families. These findings have been boiled down to one hundred essential ways to find and maintain love, joy, and satisfaction in all family relationships. Each statistic is accompanied by a true story about a real family showing the results in action.Don't Forget the Past: Parents who share stories of family history with their children create higher levels of concern for family members and increase the likelihood of their children's happiness.No Price Tag: Once basic necessities are met, the increasing economic status of one's family has zero effect on the likelihood of feeling satisfied with life.Let Every Opinion Be Heard: Senior citizens having trouble living in their own homes are 84 percent more likely to be satisfied with their housing situation if they feel as if their concerns are an important part of selecting a new home or facility.The Greatest Gift: Life satisfaction is 72 percent more likely among those who feel content with their family life.",

She demonstrates in no uncertain terms that personal values are never someone else's reponsibility but your own, and why choosing not to honor them actually compounds unhappiness. Finally she explains that by disciplining self-indulgence and rising above temptation we can discover the infinite pleasures, the true happiness, of the moral high ground.Dr. Laura delivers not only a compelling argument for an ethical approach to life but also an invaluable inspiration to rebuilding character, conscience, and courage. Here is a work that can make a genuine difference in the quality of your own life and the lives of those we love.",

But what about the peloton and the role it plays in supporting the leader? What about the difference between a stage win and a time trial? What about the Tour's curiously chivalric code of behavior? What about the caravan?With the popularity of Armstrong and the Tour outstripping our knowledge of bicycle racing, here is The Tour de France Companion, a fully illustrated primer that explains the strategies, ground rules, history, personalities, techniques, and technology behind one of the world's most spectacular and brutal sporting events. It's all clear: How teams work together. How their bikes are different from our bikes. What it takes to be a racer--the rare combination of slow- and fast-twitch muscles, a huge cardiovascular system, and an extraordinary toughness that allows you to endure more pain than your rivals. The jerseys: yellow, green, polka-dot, white, and the \"combativity prize\" to the rider who tries the hardest (look for a red race number). The complicated timing structure, including why it's so difficult to finish a tour--every rider must finish within ten percent or so of the fastest guy every single day, or head for home. Even what happens when the leader needs to make a rest stop--no, the other contenders don't zoom off into the sunset. Includes a glossary, stats, historic timeline, 2004 tour map, and more.",

For years Americans have turned to the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators to spot trends in our economy. Now The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators provides an accessible guide to sweeping - and alarming - trends in American society.The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators vividly demonstrates that since 1960 - while population, wealth, and welfare benefits climbed - America's values have deteriorated. Drawing on data from the Census Bureau, the FBI, and other government sources, Bennett provides eye-opening statistical and numerical breakdowns, charts and graphs, and a brief analysis of the data. Here are some of the startling findings: since 1960 violent crime has increased by 560 percent; the number of unmarried pregnant teenagers has nearly doubled; teen suicide has increased by more than 200 percent and the number of divorces has increased nearly 200 percent, while the marriage rate is at an all-time low.Parents, educators, and everyone across the political spectrum will find The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators an invaluable sourcebook as well as a dramatic call to arms.",

They warned in articles and interviews about the appearance of a new breed of terrorists who were determined to kill on the grand scale. More than a year before September 11, 2001, they began writing The Age of Sacred Terror to sound the alarm for a nation that had not recognized the gravest threat of our time. One of their book\u2019s original goals has remained: to provide the insights to understand an enemy unlike any seen in living memory\u2014one with an extraordinary ability to detect weakness and exploit it, one with a determination to inflict catastrophic damage, one that will not be deterred. But after September 11, a second, equally crucial goal was added: to understand how America let its defenses down, how warnings went unheeded, and how key parts of the government failed at vital tasks. The Age of Sacred Terror also describes the road ahead, where the terrorists will look to draw strength, and what the United States must do, at home and abroad, to stop them. For a year after the attacks that redefined terrorism and devastated the public\u2019s sense of security, America has been searching for answers about those responsible for one of the darkest days in our history and explanations for the glaring gaps in our defenses. The Age of Sacred Terror provides both, with unique authority. It is the book that Americans must read to understand the foremost challenge we face.",

        "Description": "This thought-provoking and timely book\u00a0from a #1 New York Times bestselling novelist and noted child psychologist reveals the factors that often lead to explosive and shocking juvenile violence.\u201cEthically and morally, kids are works in progress. Throw in psychopathy and you\u2019ve got a soul that will never be complete.\u201dIn this powerful, disturbing book, bestselling author and noted child psychologist Jonathan Kellerman shines a penetrating light on antisocial youth\u2014kids who kill without remorse\u2014asserting that \u201cpsychopathic tendencies begin very early in life, as young as three, and they endure.\u201d\u00a0Criticizing our quick impulse to blame violent movies or a \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d\u00a0society, Kellerman convinces us that it is the kids themselves who need to be examined. Carefully. How do children become cold-blooded killers? Kellerman warns that today\u2019s aggressive bully is tomorrow\u2019s Mafia don, cult leader, or genocidal dictator. Violently psychopathic youths possess an overriding need for power, control, and stimulation, and all display a complete lack of regard for the humanity of others. He examines the origins of psychopathy and the ever-shifting debate between nurture and nature, offering some controversial solutions to dealing with homicidal tendencies in children.As timely as today\u2019s headlines, more gripping than fiction, Savage Spawn is a provocative look at the links between society and biology, children and violence. Kellerman\u2019s sobering message will remain with you long after the last page is turned.",

Now, after breaking up with his longtime boyfriend, Smith looks back to his painfully normal childhood to see where all the trouble really began. Like every other American kid, Bob's adolescence was marked by alternating moments of blissful ignorance, hazy confusion, and humiliating self-consciousness. And in these pages, Bob evokes his youth with a vividness that will make you shudder and howl with recognition.In these hysterically humorous pages, Bob Smith introduces readers to his comically unsympathetic grandmother, who makes light of his carsickness: \"Bob only throws up because he's near the window and he can\"; to his first teacher crush, whose \"five-o'clock shadow could plunge a room into darkness\"; and to his first brush with fame, when he fainted from his chair during a biology filmstrip (\"Way to go, Smith!\"). Sharp, observant, ingeniously ironic and wholly satisfying, this new Lambda Award-nominated collection is at once bittersweet nostalgic fun and a testament to the unquestionable gifts of a highly original comic writer.",

The Feast of Love is just that -- a sumptuous work of fiction about  the thing that most distracts and delights us.  In a re-imagined Midsummer Night's  Dream, men and women speak of and desire their ideal mates; parents seek out their  lost children; adult children try to come to terms with their own parents and, in  some cases, find new ones. In vignettes both comic and sexy, the owner of a coffee  shop recalls the day his first wife seemed to achieve a moment of simple perfection,  while she remembers the women's softball game during which she was stricken by the  beauty of the shortstop. A young couple spends hours at the coffee shop fueling the  idea of their fierce love. A professor of philosophy, stopping by for a cup of coffee,  makes a valiant attempt to explain what he knows to be the inexplicable workings  of the human heart  Their voices resonate with each other -- disparate people joined  by the meanderings of love -- and come together in a tapestry that depicts the most  irresistible arena of life. Crafted with subtlety, grace, and power, The Feast of  Love is a masterful novel.\"Supurb.... A near perfect book, as deep as it is broad in its humaneness, comedy and wisdom.\" -- The Washington Post Book World",

Yet aside from earning them improvements in their business performance, the shift into more-process-centered organizations is causing fundamental changes in the corporate world, changes that business leaders are only now beginning to understand. What will the revolutions final legacy be? Beyond Reengineering addresses this question, exploring reengineering's effects on such areas as: Jobs: What does process-centering do to the nature of jobs? What does a process-centered workplace feel like? Managers: What is the new role of the manager in a process-centered company? Education: What skills are vital in the process-centered working world, and how can young or inexperienced workers prepare? Society: What are the implications of process-centering for employment and the economy as a whole? Investment: What are the characteristics of a successful 21st-century corporation? An informed look at one of the most profound changes to ever sweep the corporate world, Beyond Reengineering is the business manual for the 21st century.",

        "Title": "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man",
        "Authors": "By Faludi, Susan",
        "Description": "One of the most talked-about books of last year, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Backlash now explores the collapse of traditional masculinity that has left men feeling betrayed. With Backlash in 1991, Susan Faludi broke new ground when she put her finger directly on the problem bedeviling women, and the light of recognition dawned on millions of her readers: what's making women miserable isn't something they're doing to themselves in the name of independence. It's something our society is doing to women. The book was nothing less than a landmark. Now in Stiffed, the author turns her attention to the masculinity crisis plaguing our culture at the end of the '90s, an era of massive layoffs, \"Angry White Male\" politics, and Million Man marches. As much as the culture wants to proclaim that men are made miserable--or brutal or violent or irresponsible--by their inner nature and their hormones, Faludi finds that even in the world they supposedly own and run, men are at the mercy of cultural forces that disfigure their lives and destroy their chance at happiness. As traditional masculinity continues to collapse, the once-valued male attributes of craft, loyalty, and social utility are no longer honored, much less rewarded. Faludi's journey through the modern masculine landscape takes her into the lives of individual men whose accounts reveal the heart of the male dilemma. Stiffed brings us into the world of industrial workers, sports fans, combat veterans, evangelical husbands, militiamen, astronauts, and troubled \"bad\" boys--whose sense that they've lost their skills, jobs, civic roles, wives, teams, and a secure future is only one symptom of a larger and historic betrayal.

A placard around his neck bears the ominous words The Secret Alliance Has Spoken. Rafferty plunges into the case with his usual gusto, but finds more questions than answers. Was the murder the work of the union-busting Citizens Alliance or wild-eyed anarchists? Was the victim linked to an empire of corruption controlled by the city's slippery mayor? And how did the young man come to possess a photograph of a prominent citizen engaged in sexual congress? As the puzzle deepens and the dangers mount, Rafferty is joined, just in time, by his old friends Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson.",

But first she has to journey  to California to be reunited with her mother and brother. No sooner does she arrive  there than she learns that Malcolm X has been assassinated.

        "Description": "America's democratic ideals have long been the hope of the world, but our allies increasingly see us as abandoning those ideals. It's not hard to understand why. In the months before 9/11, the United States walked away from a number of international treaties including the Kyoto Accord. After the attack, the United States turned a cold shoulder to NATO's offers to assist with the invasion of Afghanistan, unilaterally terminated the ABM treaty, and actively opposed the creation of an International Criminal Court. Then came the war on Iraq, begun despite the clear refusal of the United Nations Security Council to authorize an invasion.Obsessed with our own immediate military and economic security, we now deem institutions like NATO and the UN irrelevant. We have abandoned containment for a policy of preventive attacks on potential threats. More and more, we act alone, with little regard for the needs and goals of other nations.Rogue Nation is not an argument against American dominance or the exercise of American power. It's an argument against stupidity, arrogance, and ignorance in the exercise of power. Prestowitz explores the historical roots of the unilateral impulse and shows how it now influences every important area of American foreign policy. Even now, when the need for multilateral action has never been greater, we continue to act contrary to international law, custom, and our own best interests.",

        "Description": "Did Woodrow Wilson murder his first wife? Of course not. Did Hillary Clinton throw the lamp? Maybe. From Thomas Jefferson to William Jefferson Clinton, Scorpion Tongues is a popular history of gossip in American politics. Complete with wickedly delightful anecdotes of major and minor politicians and entertainers over the last 200 years, Gail Collins examines the evolving relationship between politicians and the press and the blurring of the lines between politicians and celebrities. Supported by extensive research and written with an entertaining flair, she speculates on how gossip reflects the current moral compass of the time, noting how a rumor, like an unpredictable summer tornado, can flatten one reputation while a similar story passes over another with hardly a rustle. \"Hilariously readable\" (The Economist), Scorpion Tongues offers sinful scandals and mild hearsay for every taste.",

Such a book is Masters of the Art of Command, a wide-ranging series of essays on military leaders, ancient and modern,   whose actions and personalities provide insights into the interplay of   time, circumstance, and individual character and ability that makes  for  success--or, equally instructive, for failure.\"In a lively and perceptive introductory essay, Stokesbury sketches the ever-changing circumstances, tools, and social purposes of warfare to reveal its essential continuity of principle. In the series of essays that follow, Blumenson casts a wide net--over 'Some Masters of the Art' (Sulla, Saxe, Thomas, and Huebner, among others); over 'Masters of Mobile Warfare' (Iberville, Crook, Wolseley, Hart, Montgomery, and Patton); over 'Coalition Warfare' (Rochambeau, Eisenhower, and various command problems and situations); and over special problems such as military obedience, Hitler and his generals, and the 'maverick' military leader.\"For the general reader, this book will provide a fascinating trip across historical fields of battle; for the military professional or student of military history, it should strike sparks of recognition and illumination, and even touch a few nerve endings in the process. One can hardly ask for more.\"--Col John G. Thompson, USAWC",

Although any seven-year-old will have moments of exuberance, security, and happiness, in general this is an age of introspection. As it begins, parents and teachers may welcome the quiet after the tussles and tangles of Six. But once the child of Seven starts to withdraw it\u2019s almost as though he doesn't know where or when to stop. Seven-year-olds feel picked on by family, friends, and teachers alike; they worry that no one likes them; they expect every little task to prove too difficult to handle; tears come easily at this age. \u00a0 With wit and wisdom, Dr. Ames of the highly respected Gesell Institute and Carol Chase Haber offer insights into what children this age are feeling and thinking, and how parents can best deal with these moody, serious Sevens. \u00a0 Included in this book: \u2022 New body awareness \u2022 Sulking \u2022 Concerns about fairness \u2022 Stories from real life \u2022 Fascination with horror, gore \u2022 Threats of running away from home \u2022 Life in the second grade \u2022 Books for Sevens and the parents of Sevens \u00a0 \u201cLouise Bates Ames and her colleagues synthesize a lifetime of observation of children, consultation, and discussion with parents.

        "Description": "Locked in the Cabinet is a close-up view of the way things work, and often don't work, at the highest levels of government - and a uniquely personal account by the man whose ideas inspired and animated much of the Clinton campaign of 1992 and who became the cabinet officer in charge of helping ordinary Americans get better jobs. Robert B. Reich, writer, teacher, social critic - and a friend of the Clintons since they were all in their twenties - came to be known as the \"conscience\" of the Clinton administration and one of the most successful Labor Secretaries in history. Here is his sometimes hilarious, sometimes poignant chronicle of trying to put ideas and ideals into practice.With wit, passion, and dead-aim honesty, Reich writes of those in Washington who possess hard heads and soft hearts, and those with exactly the opposite attributes. He introduces us to the career bureaucrats who make Washington run and the politicians who, on occasion, make it stop; to business tycoons and labor leaders who clash by day and party together by night; to a president who wants to change America and his opponents (on both the left and the right) who want to keep it as it is or return it to where it used to be. Reich guides us to the pinnacles of power and pretension, as bills are passed or stalled, reputations built or destroyed, secrets leaked, numbers fudged, egos bruised, news stories spun, hypocrisies exposed, and good intentions occasionally derailed. And to the places across America where those who are the objects of this drama are simply trying to get by - assembly lines, sweatshops, union halls, the main streets of small towns and the tough streets of central cities.Locked in the Cabinet is an intimate odyssey involving a memorable cast - a friend who is elected President of the United States, only to discover the limits of power; Alan Greenspan, who is the most powerful man in America; and Newt Gingrich, who tries to be. Plus a host of others: White House staffers and cabinet members who can't find \"the loop\"; political consultant Dick Morris, who becomes \"the loop\"; baseball players and owners who can't agree on how to divide up $2 billion a year; a union leader who accuses Reich of not knowing what a screwdriver looks like; a heretofore invisible civil servant deep in the Labor Department whose brainchild becomes the law of the land; and a wondrous collection of senators, foreign ministers, cabinet officers, and television celebrities. And it is also an odyssey for Reich's wife and two young sons, who learn to tolerate their own cabinet member but not to abide Washington.",

But the greatest threat to Hitler's dream of a Thousand Year Reich lies east, where his forces are pitted in a death match with a Russian enemy willing to pay any price to defend the motherland. Hitler rolls the dice, hurling his best SS forces and his fearsome new weapon, the Mark VI Tiger tank, in a last-ditch summer offensive, code-named Citadel.The Red Army around Kursk is a sprawling array of infantry, armor, fighter planes, and bombers. Among them is an intrepid group of women flying antiquated biplanes; they swoop over the Germans in the dark, earning their nickname, \"Night Witches.\" On the ground, private Dimitri Berko gallops his tank, the Red Army's lithe little T-34, like a Cossack steed. In the turret above Dimitri rides his son, Valya, a Communist sergeant who issues his father orders while the war widens the gulf between them. In the skies, Dimitri's daughter, Katya, flies with the Night Witches, until she joins a ferocious band of partisans in the forests around Kursk. Like Russia itself, the Berko family is suffering the fury and devastation of history's most titanic tank battle while fighting to preserve what is sacred - their land, their lives, and each other - as Hitler flings against them his most potent armed force.Inexorable and devastating, a company of Mark VI Tiger tanks is commanded by one extraordinary SS officer, a Spaniard known as la Daga, the Dagger. He'd suffered a terrible wound at the hands of the Russians: now he has returned with a cold fury to exact his revenge. And above it all, one quiet man makes his own plan to bring Citadel crashing down and reshape the fate of the world.",
