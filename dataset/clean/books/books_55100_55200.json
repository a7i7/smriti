        "Description": "Do clouds truly have silver linings? Betty Rollin answers with a resounding yes in this wise, moving, and funny book about the surprising upsides to life\u2019s most challenging, painful, and seemingly insurmountable low blows. Rollin has been there. After being diagnosed with breast cancer more than thirty years ago\u2013and again nine years later\u2013she managed to find an astonishingly bright side to the darkness. She shares her often zany and unpredictable personal experiences of turning the worst into the best, and shows how others have done the same\u2013thriving in adversity to a remarkable degree and coming to recognize their various blessings in disguise.Steve Jobs describes how being fired from Apple, the company he founded, was one of the best things that ever happened to him. Homemaker Sally Fleming made a better life for herself and her family after a fire. Only when workaholic CEO Eugene O\u2019Kelly was diagnosed with a terminal illness did he really begin to live his life to the fullest. Bill Clinton, Charles Colson, and others describe life changes after adversity. Rollin reveals the science behind the theory of adversarial, or post-traumatic, growth. This paradox is not about denying hardship but about finding a way to benefit from it. Seeing the bright enables us to find the good, whatever form it takes, within the bad and proceed from there. Poignant, timely, universal, and inspiring, Here\u2019s the Bright Side proves that amid life\u2019s struggles and losses, there is much to be gained\u2013wisdom, strength, and, perhaps most important, gratitude. \u201cTry feeling gloomy and grateful all at once,\u201d says Rollin. \u201cYou can\u2019t. Gratitude picks you up and puts you in a place where gloom cannot thrive.\u201d",

        "Title": "Dragon Rising: An Inside Look at China Today",
        "Authors": "By Becker, Jasper",
        "Description": "Jasper Becker's book, The Chinese, was hailed as the best single-volume introduction to this enormous, inscrutable society. The Washington Post said, \"He has been everywhere and asked every question,\" describing his conclusions as \"right in both details and analysis.\" Since then, China's role in world affairs has only grown greater. No nation on Earth is as newsworthy as 21st-century China?and no book could be timelier than Dragon Rising, appearing just as world attention begins to focus on the 2008 Beijing Olympics and China's all-out effort to present itself as a modern world power. As interest grows, Becker is the ideal guide to the profound changes that are already reshaping economic, diplomatic, and military strategies all over the globe.  Intertwining in-depth analysis with revealing anecdotal evidence, Becker addresses every major question. What form will China's government take? How will communism's legacy affect modernization? Can Shanghai's success with urban capitalism be replicated elsewhere? Will wholesale cultural and economic change be resisted by the millions facing sudden transition from an authoritarian state to a market-driven society? How will the new China cope with pollution, unemployment, and voracious demand for energy? Each chapter examines a specific region and such key local issues as poverty, minority unrest, and official corruption, then places them in the broader context of Chinese society as a whole. Vividly illustrated with photographs that capture the paradox of an ancient culture remaking itself into a dynamic consumer society, Dragon Rising is a wonderfully written, well-rounded, wide-ranging portrait of China's problems and prospects.",

Tomatoes are stuffed with bread, garlic, and herbs before grilling. Artichokes are grilled and drizzled with lemon juice and oregano. Italians do extraordinary things with seafood, too. Even the simplest grilled shrimp is unforgettable. And what do you serve with your classic Grilled Tuna \"Originata\"? In Grill Italian you will find a chapter of traditional pasta and salad accompaniments.In his introduction, Wright tackles the burning questions about grilling: Which makes better-tasting food, gas or charcoal? Supermarket briquets or hard-to-find hardwood lump charcoal? It doesn't really matter, Wright says. The reason food tastes good when grilled is that fat drips down on hot coals or lava rocks and returns in the form of smoke to flavor the food.While your backyard may not overlook the azure waters of the Tyrrhenian Sea, with Grill Italian you can bring the intense, natural flavors of Italian grilling to your table.",

She introduces us to and takes us into the homes of these unusually creative people, who share her belief that thrift, economy, and ingenuity translate into high style indeed.There are before-and-after pictures, tips on repair and storage hints on how to bargain, ideas for themed collections and even a list of what to bring on junking expeditions. The author reveals the price of almost every one of the hundreds and hundreds of items pictured, and best of all provides a directory to more than two \"junking sites\" nationwide.American Junk is a one-of-a-kind book for those who appreciate the rare, the idiosyncratic, and the unexpected - those who realize that there are as many kinds of junk as there are individuals.",

        "Description": "The ideas in Busy but Balanced are for the people who need them the most-those of us out in the world putting our longings, goals, and ideas into action and balancing that with creating a nourishing home and deeply connecting with our children.  It's not about giving up desire but, instead, creating a right relationship with all aspects of ourselves and our world.  Rather than breathlessly grasping at the shards of our lives, we can boldly and calmly expand to embrace all aspects of it-alert and relaxed.A mother of two young children expressed what many of us feel:  \"I want a simple life; I want a busy life.  I don't want it cluttered with junk, but I want it vibrant.  My relationship is with my family, and I want that at the core of my life; but I also want meaningful work. My family is forever so I want that to thrive, but I want the day in and day out at work to be good too.\"Fear of change locks many of us into rote living-treadmill days.  Busy but Balanced, a practical and inspirational guide, will help you take action month by month, manage change, even invite it in, to create a full life lived with no regrets.  Making choices allows you to live sanely with more joy, energy, and success-without sacrifice.  ---From the Introduction",

Mandating a testing regime to force schools to continually improve student performance, it uses school choice and additional learning resources as sticks and carrots intended to improve low-performing schools and districts. The focus is on improving alternatives to children in low-performing schools.Here top experts evaluate the potential and the problems of NCLB in its initial stages of implementation. This first look provides valuable insights, offering lessons crucial to understanding this dramatic change in American education.",

        "Title": "Celebrating Family Milestones: By Making Art Together",
        "Authors": "By Linesch, Debra, Ph.D.",
        "Description": "As each family grows and develops, everyone experiences the challenge of changes and transitions. Although adults frequently have trouble coping with change, it can be much more difficult for a child. Even birthdays, temporary separations or friends moving away can result in confused feelings that are very difficult for children to express and handle by themselves. The basic message of Celebrating Family Milestones is that families can communicate with each other and provide mutual support by making art together.    The author is a professional psychologist who has used art therapy to reach children with serious problems they were unable to deal with verbally. She has applied the same techniques to help families (including her own) weather transitions and grow closer and stronger.    This book deals with two major problems that impede communication: lack of time together and the difficulty of expressing            feelings through words alone. By taking time on a regular basis to make art together, families participate in an enjoyable activity that provides the setting for communication. Making art together helps family members to express feelings with more than just words, which are often so difficult to find, especially for children.    Although children will usually say they're okay, they often hide the fear or confusion they feel inside. In their art children will express - often unconsciously - what they really feel. The results provide valuable clues for parents, who can use this opportunity for discussion and reassurance if necessary.    Projects cover a wide range of family experience, including the birth of a new baby, the death of a grandparent, a temporary separation during a parent's business trip, the celebration of New Year's and the importance of the family tree. Every project is complete in itself, yet the author leaves room for             improvisation to suit each family's particular situation.    Celebrating Family Milestones will be welcomed by parents and educators alike. The simple but distinctive projects require no particular skill and no expensive materials. The emphasis is on the process of working together to make art and the feelings expressed through this activity, rather than the final product. However, many of the pieces made with the help of this book will ultimately become family treasures, rich with memories and associations.",

        "Description": "Despite the increased focus on self-esteem over the past three decades, depression in children has continued to grow, now affecting a quarter of all kids today. To combat this trend, Dr. Seligman began the Penn Depression Prevention Project, the first long term study aimed at 8 to 12 year olds. His findings were revolutionary, proving that children can be against depression by being taught how to challenge their pessimistic thoughts.   The Optimistic Child offers parents and teachers the tools developed in this study to teach children of all ages life skills that transform helplessness into mastery and bolster self-esteem. Learning the skills of optimism not only reduces the risk of depression but boosts school performance, improves physical health, and provides children with the self-reliance they need as they approach the teenage years and beyond. world of optimists is a bigger world, a world of more possibilities, says Seligman. Filled with practical advice and written in clear, helpful language, this book is an invaluable resource for caregivers who want to open up this world for their children.",

Once there, she urges the reader to grab a pen, grasp a keyboard, and seize the moment when perception fires revelation and language becomes art.Each page features an essay exploring an aspect of the writing process, an exercise to get the reader writing, and a quotation to tickle the mind and keep the writing going.

        "Description": "Award-winning author Paul Levine captures the dark side of the legal world with gripping, mordantly witty prose that \"gets leaner, meatier, better with every book\" (Miami Herald). Now, he delivers a thrillingly authentic page-turner about the murderous secrets of those who make and break the law at the highest level: the United States Supreme Court.  Lisa Fremont is a rising young lawyer gifted with a brilliant mind, natural beauty -- and an alluring sensuality. A newly hired law clerk on the staff of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Truitt, Lisa has a bright future. She also has a past that her curriculum vitae doesn't reveal....Long before she was Lisa Fremont, Esquire, she was Angel, an underage stripper in San Francisco's Tiki Club. And long before Max Wanaker was president of Atlantica Airlines, he was the wealthy benefactor who took her off the streets.Her driving ambition put her at the top of her class at Stanford, but her tuition, a highpowered career head start, and a new life came courtesy of Max, who knew a good bet when he saw it. Max took his angel far with a devil of a deal -- now, he's calling in the debt.  Three years ago, on its approach to Miami International, Atlantica Flight 640 crashed, claiming hundreds of lives and sparking a multimillion-dollar legal battle that is about to come before the Supreme Court. The swing vote belongs to Sam Truitt, and Max is depending on Lisa's expertise in the art of persuasion to save Atlantica. Lisa knows there's only one way to get Justice Truitt's vote: put aside her passion for justice and get into Truitt's life, into his head -- and into his bed.  But Lisa's obligation to Max is about to be overruled by a raw desire for Sam Truitt....One of the nation's most powerful men, Justice Truitt is also just a man -- with a failing marriage and a sharp, sexy law clerk succeeding in winning him over. Not knowing whom to trust as he steps into the minefield of the Atlantica case, he puts his career and his life on the line to strip away layers of corruption and violence outside the system -- and within. For even among his fellow Justices -- as tangled and deadly as nine scorpions in a bottle -- Truitt may find the deadly sting of malevolence at the highest levels of Law.  In the Machiavellian maze of political intrigue and personal betrayal that is the Supreme Court, Lisa Fremont and Sam Truitt could make one hell of a legal team. But inside the hidden sanctums of the halls of justice, there's only one rule to live by: stay one step ahead of those who live by no law at all.",
