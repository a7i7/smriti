        "Title": "Baking from the Heart: Our Nation's Best Bakers Share Cherished Recipes for The Great American Bake Sale (A Share Our Strength Book to Fight Hunger)",
        "Authors": "By Rosen, Michael J.",
        "Description": "Baking is about memories: recipes handed down from generation to generation and tastes that conjure childhood\u2014think of Proust\u2019s madeleines or your mom\u2019s chocolate cake.  Sweets are often bound up in our emotional life as adults, too: they\u2019re how we reward ourselves or our children, how we celebrate holidays, birthdays, and special occasions, and how we honor guests.  In Baking from the Heart, more than fifty of the nation\u2019s preeminent bakers share their recipes for cookies, cakes, and other dessert favorites, and the memories of why they hold that recipe dear.  From the Apple Snacking Spice Cake that Joanna Chang made her fourth-grade teacher to show her how much she loved her to the Polvorones that were a Sunday after-church treat in Miguel Ravago\u2019s home, these are recipes\u2014and stories\u2014to treasure.When James Beard Award\u2013winner Greg Patent was a teenager, he won a trip to New York City to compete in the Pillsbury Bake-Off with his Cherry-Apricot Coconut Bars.  Forty years later, his mother earned a place in that same competition with her Walnut Fudge Bars.  World-renowned chocolatier Jacques Torres tucked a few pints of hand-picked Michigan blueberries into his luggage so he could again make Blueberry Dame Blanche, the jam-filled cookies he made when he was a child in France, with his aging mother. For her son Gio\u2019s first Valentine\u2019s Day at school, Food TV\u2019s Gale Gand concocted Marshmallow Heart Throbs, a cupcake he could cut into the shape of a heart.  When Jimmy Schmidt\u2019s family vacationed in Wisconsin, his contribution to his mother\u2019s Black Walnut Pound Cake were the walnuts he picked and shelled with his siblings, aided by their father who would crack the hulls by driving over them in his \u201955 Chevy.  Like many of the other contributors, Jimmy Schmidt serves up two recipes with reminiscences (the walnut cake and his Blueberry Slump) for our delectation.  Baking from the Heart is also sweet inspiration for anyone who wants to join in The Great American Bake Sale\u2122.  When Share Our Strength\u2014the nation\u2019s preeminent hunger-fighting organization\u2014joined with PARADE magazine to launch The Great American Bake Sale\u2122 in 2003, the country\u2019s response was overwhelming: nearly half a million people baked, bought, or sold, raising over a million dollars to end childhood hunger.  (More information appears inside.)A portion of the proceeds from the sale of this book benefit Share Our Strength, one of the nation\u2019s preeminent anti-hunger agencies.",

A classically trained anthropologist, she answers questions we all have about our pets' behavior. Do dogs have different barks that mean different things? What makes a dog difficult to house-train? Why do certain dogs and cats get along so well? How does Snoopy recognize people he sees only once a year, while Misty barks at strangers she sees every day?  The Social Lives of Dogs presents marvelous evidence of the power of the group -- and shows us that those who are fortunate enough to be given the trust of an honorable dog will also have their lives enriched.",

        "Authors": "By Yancey, Philip",
        "Description": "Philip Yancey has a way of confronting our most cherished but misguided notions about faith. In The Bible Jesus Read, he challenges the perception that the New Testament is all that matters and the Old Testament isn\u2019t worth taking the time to read and understand. Yancey admits that, like many Christians, he usually avoided the Old Testament. After all, why bother with writings that can be so baffling, boring, even offensive to the modern mind? But a surprising discovery awaited Yancey when he began to explore how the Old Testament related to his life today. Those seemingly irrelevant Hebrew Scriptures took on a startling immediacy, portraying a passionate relationship between God and people against the broad backdrop of human experience. Like nothing else, the Old Testament depicts the cries, the complaints, the deep, insistent questionings of the heart, the stuff of life we all must contend with. With his candid, signature style, Yancey interacts with the Old Testament from the perspective of his own deeply personal journey. From Moses, the amazing prince of Egypt, to the psalmists\u2019 turbulent emotions and the prophets\u2019 oddball rantings, Yancey paints a picture of Israel\u2019s God--and ours--that fills in the blanks of a solely New Testament vision of the Almighty. Probing some carefully selected Old Testament books--Job, Deuteronomy, Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and the Prophets--Yancey reveals how the Old Testament deals in astonishing depth and detail with the issues that trouble us most. The Old Testament in fact tackles what the New Testament often only skirts. But that shouldn\u2019t surprise us. It is, after all, the Bible Jesus read. The Bible Jesus Read will give you abundant new insights into the heart of God the Father. And as you read with a fresh eye the prayers, poems, songs, and bedtime stories that Jesus so revered, you will gain a profound new understanding of Christ. \"The more we comprehend the Old Testament,\" Yancey writes, \"the more we comprehend Jesus.\"",

When she looks at her sister Sonia, she sees svelte and success. When she looks at God, she sees that divine love can't possibly be doled out equally. All her life, Lucia has coped by throwing herself into taking care of those who seem more worthy of God's goods, and feeding the dreams she has buried alive. But when tragedy strikes Lucia's family, she meets Sullivan Crisp--a decidedly offbeat psychologist who is trying to cope with his own shattered past. They form an alliance to try to hold her family together and, in the process, both tentatively dip their toes into the waters of healing. Step by faltering step they wade in, forging an unlikely community and digging deep for the courage to face a lurking danger that could pull them under . . . or remind them what it's like to dance on the waves.",

The success or failure of a stepparent to bond with stepchildren can make or break a new marriage.  But this book has a refreshing message--it is possible to achieve longlasting, rewarding relationships with your new children.  Most stepparents feel caught in a bind because in order to connect with their stepchild, they have to reach out--but not too much, too little, or too deliberately.  And relationships with stepchildren are inherently different from those with biological children who love their parent unconditionally.  But these 7 basic steps will give you the essentials, from deciding what kind of stepparent you want to be to realizing that love comes later.",

        "Title": "Martha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres Handbook",
        "Authors": "By Stewart, Martha, Spungen, Susan, and Gallaher, Dana (PHT)",
        "Description": "No one knows better how to give a party than Martha Stewart--and as she proves in this comprehensive and visually dazzling handbook, great parties begin with great hors d'oeuvres. Three hundred all-new recipes, each photographed in full color, show why Martha Stewart is still America's style authority and most trusted party host.It was fifteen years ago that Martha Stewart first turned her creativity and talent for teaching to this subject, when she defined the look and flavor of party appetizers for professionals and home cooks in Martha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres. Since then, America's tastes have evolved and Martha's own approach to food has expanded to encompass flavors from around the world, seasonal ingredients fresh from the garden, and\u00a0\u00a0innovative preparations all presented with an unsurpassed eye for beauty.In this book, after laying out the basic foundations and techniques, Martha presents chapters on different hors d'oeuvre categories that are brimming with new ideas--Layered and Stacked; Wrapped, Rolled, Filled, Folded, and Stuffed; and Skewered and Threaded. Whether a classic cocktail party food reinvigorated with her wit and style--chicken salad tea sandwiches turned on their sides and encrusted with sesame seeds, for example--or deliciously decadent dips for crudit\u00e9s and seafood updated with Indian dhal or white beans and mustard greens; tiny toasted breadboxes filled with Welsh rarebit; or savory sips of soups in edible cups, these impeccable jewels are as exciting as anything Martha has ever invited her readers to serve on the buffet or tea table or pass among guests.Reflecting Martha's favorite way to entertain now--informal and relaxed--there is also Bites and Pieces, a chapter packed with simple recipes for parties that please the guests without undoing the host. Marinated olives, spiced and seasoned nuts, handmade cheese crackers, and spicy cocktail ribs can be prepared quickly and easily in advance and arranged before the doorbell rings. Even the drinks have been provided: classic and contemporary cocktails, imaginatively garnished, are accompanied by a guide to stocking the bar and serving champagne.Everything about Martha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres Handbook has been considered to create a book that is easy to use. The size was chosen to comfortably fit in the hand, in the cookbook holder, or on the kitchen counter. Color photographs in the front of the book help cooks select which hors d'oeuvres to combine for their own parties; the cross-referenced recipes in the back have been tested in Martha's own kitchen and in the test kitchens of Martha Stewart Living; and two place-marking ribbons keep track of both picture and recipe. And every detail has been covered--tips on techniques and ingredients, serving ideas, menu suggestions, recipe variations, advice on party planning, and even a glossary of equipment, special ingredients, and supplies, with a guide to finding them. With its range of recipes, its wealth of ideas, its lavish photography, and its innovative format, Martha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres Handbook is simply the most instructive, inspirational, and indispensable guide to hors d'oeuvres ever compiled.",
