New co-author Clay Christensen provides his insights on innovation management and new market entries through several new cases. Approximately 40% of the cases are entirely new to this edition.Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation takes the perspective of the general manager at the product line, business unit, and corporate levels. The book not only examines each of these levels in some detail, but also addresses the interaction between the different levels of general management - for example, the fit between product strategy and business unit strategy, and the link between business and corporate level technology strategy.Each part of the book starts with an introductory chapter laying out an overall framework and offering a brief discussion of key tools and findings from existing literature. The remainder of each part offers a selected handful of seminar readings and case studies. Almost all of the cases deal with recent events and situations, including several that are concerned with the impact of the Internet. A few \"classics\" have been retained, however, because they capture a timeless issue or problem in such a definitive way that the historical date of their writing is irrelevant.",

        "Title": "The Creation of the Future: The Role of the American University",
        "Authors": "By Rhodes, Frank Harold Trevor",
        "Description": "Is the university a dinosaur: huge, lumbering, endearing in its own way, yet unsuited to today's world? Is it a thing of the past, unnecessary in an age of the Internet and online learning? In a book likely to provoke people who are loyal to the ideal of the university as well as those who foresee its demise, Frank H. T. Rhodes acknowledges that the university is an imperfect institution, but argues that it plays an essential role in modern society. In the process, he articulates strong opinions on a range of difficult issues.  The Creation of the Future is no defense or promotion of the status quo. Focusing on American research universities, Rhodes makes the case that they are an irreplaceable resource, quite literally a national and international treasure, whose value must be preserved through judicious renewal and reform, beginning with a rededication to teaching as a moral vocation. Rhodes discusses where the research university is today and how it got here, as well as where it must go in the future. In the process, he addresses a wide range of contemporary challenges facing the institution, including*why universities can no longer be \"ivory towers\"*why post-tenure review of professors is desirable*whether grading standards have become too lax*why unionization of graduate students is inappropriate*why affirmative action is necessary*how governance and leadership can be improved*how to maintain a sense of commitment to the university in the face of increasing disciplinary specialization*why faculty must affirm that university membership has not only its privileges, but also its price.*what should and should not be done to control the rapid rise in tuition.*whether curricula of professional schools should be more heavily weighted toward the liberal arts.*why service is a social obligation of all universities, not just land-grant institutions.*why research is vital to effective teaching.His eighteen-year tenure as president of Cornell University gives Rhodes a unique perspective on a system he finds both invaluable and in need of change. Although he is an enthusiastic advocate, he pulls no punches in recommending sweeping changes. The greatest catastrophe facing universities today, he writes, is loss of community: \"Without community, knowledge becomes idiosyncratic. The lone learner, studying in isolation, is vulnerable to narrowness, dogmatism, and untested assumption; pursued in community, learning will be expansive and informed, contested by opposing interpretations, leavened by differing experience, and refined by alternative viewpoints.\"In championing a new relevance for the American research university, Rhodes argues for renewal through the application of old virtues to new realities. Campus culture, he says, must embrace the human experience in all its richness, breadth, and ambiguity if it is to survive and thrive.",

Moving from the desolation of North Korea to the oak-and-leather preserves of Wall Street to the subterranean surveillance headquarters in the Pentagon, By Dawn's Early Light traces the journey of Sloane Ryder, a young, straight-shooting financial analyst who gets caught in the undertow of large-scale political maneuverings involving the United States' ever-sensitive relationship with China. While Washington, Wall Street, and Beijing jockey for position in East Asia, Sloane uncovers a plot -- woven by some of the most eminent figures in government -- to murder the first woman president of the United States. As she frantically pieces together a series of strange but seemingly unrelated events, her trail leads her to the Handyman, a merciless killer-for-hire. Suddenly she finds she's playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse where each move could be her last.  By Dawn's Early Light is a Roman candle of interlocking conspiracies, Faustian bargains, and shadowy alliances among unlikely parties. A high-wire act of collusion and double-cross, its shocking plot twists will keep readers reeling till the very last pages.",

Sadly for his countless admirers, he hitched his own ride to the great beyond much too soon. Culled posthumously from Adams\u2019s fleet of beloved Macintosh computers, this selection of essays, articles, anecdotes, and stories offers a fascinating and intimate portrait of the multifaceted artist and absurdist wordsmith. Join Adams on an excursion to climb Kilimanjaro . . . dressed in a rhino costume; peek into the private life of Genghis Khan\u2014warrior and world-class neurotic; root for the harried author\u2019s efforts to get a Hitchhiker movie off the ground in Hollywood; thrill to the further exploits of private eye Dirk Gently and two-headed alien Zaphod Beeblebrox. Though Douglas Adams is gone, he\u2019s left us something very special to remember him by. Without a doubt.\u201cWorth reading and even cherishing, if only because it\u2019s the last we\u2019ll hear from the master of comic science fiction.\u201d\u2014The Star-Ledger",

Inspiration for the MAJOR MOTION PICTURE starring Academy Award winner Brie LarsonTo five-year-old-Jack, Room is the world. . . . It's where he was born, it's where he and his Ma eat and sleep and play and learn. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits. Room is home to Jack, but to Ma it's the prison where she has been held for seven years. Through her fierce love for her son, she has created a life for him in this eleven-by-eleven-foot space. But with Jack's curiosity building alongside her own desperation, she knows that Room cannot contain either much longer.Room is a tale at once shocking, riveting, exhilarating--a story of unconquerable love in harrowing circumstances, and of the diamond-hard bond between a mother and her child.",

During this season the Church reads consecutively from the Acts of the Apostles, recounting the external life of the Church after Pentecost. The accompanying readings from the Gospel according to John portray the internal life of Christian disciples and promise a coming Paraclete to be sent by the Father. Father Brown's title A Once-and-Coming Spirit signifies these two great biblical sources that he reflects on. He shows how these readings speak to our time as we live out the external history of a visible Church while internally drawing life from Jesus as branches on the vine. His comments offer an opportunity to appreciate the intent of the season after Easter and to prepare ourselves for the intensified gift of the spirit at Pentecost.",

This book is must reading for anyone who would understand the spirituality of young people at the turn of a new millennium.--Robert A. Ludwig, author of Reconstructing Catholicism for a New GenerationIn Virtual Faith, Beaudoin explores fashion, music videos, and cyberspace concluding that his generation has fashioned a theology radically different from, but no less potent or valid than, that of their elders.Beaudoin's investigation of popular culture uncovers four themes that underpin his generation?s theology. First, all institutions are suspect -- especially organized religion. Second, personal experience is everything, and every form of intense personal experience is potentially spiritual. Third, suffering is also spiritual. Finally, this generation sees ambiguity as a central element of faith. This book opens a long overdue conversation about where and how we find meaning, and how we all can encourage each other in this central human searching.Tom Beaudoin earned his Master of Theological Studies from Harvard University School of Divinity in 1996 and is currently working toward a Ph.D. in Religion and Education at Boston College.",

        "Authors": "By Jones, Charles O.",
        "Description": "Popular interpretations of American government tend to center on the presidency. Successes and failures of government are often attributed to presidents themselves. But, though the White House stands as a powerful symbol of government, the United States has a separated system intentionally designed to distribute power, not to concentrate it. Charles O. Jones explains that focusing exclusively on the presidency can lead to a seriously distorted picture of how the national government works. The role of the president varies widely, depending on his resources, advantages, and strategic position. Public expectations often far exceed the president's personal, political, institutional, or constitutional capacities for achievement. Jones explores how presidents find their place in the permanent government and how they are \"fitted in\" by others, most notably those on Capitol Hill. This book shows how a separated system of government works under the circumstances created by the Constitution and encouraged by a two-party system. Jones examines the organizational challenges facing presidents, their public standing and what it means, presidential agendas and mandates, and lawmakinghow it works, where the president fits in, and how it varies from issue to issue. He compares the post-World War II presidents and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each in working within the separated system. Jones proposes a view of government as a legitimate, even productive, form of decisionmaking and emphasizes the varying strategies available to presidents for governing. He concludes with a number of important lessons for presidents and advice on how to make the separated system work better.",

Jonah Gersten, M.D., a Park Avenue plastic surgeon, clearly adored her. He was handsome, successful, and a doting dad to their four-year-old triplets Dashiell, Evan, and Mason. But when Jonah is found in the Upper East Side apartment of second-rate \u201cescort\u201d Dorinda Dillon, Susie is overwhelmed with questions left unanswered. It\u2019s bad enough to know your husband\u2019s been murdered, but even worse when you\u2019re universally pitied (and quietly mocked) because of the sleaze factor. None of it makes sense to Susie\u2014not a sexual liaison with someone like Dorinda, not the \u201cbetter not to discuss it\u201d response from Jonah\u2019s partners. With help from her tough-talking, high-style Grandma Ethel who flies in from Miami, she takes on her snooty in-laws, her husband\u2019s partners, the NYPD, and the DA (is the person arrested for the homicide the actual perp, or just an easy mark for a prosecutor who hates the word \u201cunsolved\u201d?), as she tries to prove that her wonderful life with Jonah was no lie.   Susan Isaacs brilliantly turns the conventions of the mystery on end as Susie Gersten, suburban mom, floral designer, and fashion plate, searches not so much for answers to her husband\u2019s death as for answers to her own life.",

        "Title": "Against the Tide: How a Compliant Congress Empowered a Reckless President",
        "Authors": "By Chafee, Lincoln",
        "Description": "In this smart, candid, and surprising political memoir, Lincoln Chafee offers a behind-the-scenes look at the first six years of the Bush Administration from the vantage point of one of the few Republican moderates in the Senate.            When Senator Chafee (R-RI) went to Washington, he encountered a Republican Party drifting so far to the right it no longer stood for the mainstream principles that united Americans. Instead, under the direction of George W. Bush, the Party had fallen victim to extremism. In the face of this trend, Chafee stood fast as one of the most liberal Republicans in the Senate, seeking to cut across partisan lines at the very time that they threatened to irrevocably divide the nation.             A political iconoclast, Chafee was the only Republican senator to have expressed support for same-sex marriage; the only Republican to vote in favor of reinstating the top federal tax rate on upper-income payers; the only Republican in the Senate to have voted against authorization of the use of force in Iraq; the only Republican to vote for the Levin-Reed amendment calling for a nonbinding timetable for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq; and the only Republican to vote against Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito. Chafee favored increased federal funding for health care, supported affirmative action and gun control, supported women\u2019s reproductive rights, and endorsed federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. Sometimes referred to by conservatives as a RINO (Republican in Name Only), Chafee turns the tables on the right and asks why it has enabled Bush Jr. to pull the GOP and the nation away from traditional principles of fiscal conservatism, respect for our environment, and aversion to foreign entanglements.              Unabashedly frank, Chafee\u2019s memoir recounts his political journey from small-town mayor to a voice crying from the congressional wilderness. He offers a forward-looking assessment of what comes next for the Republican and Democratic parties, and he also addresses the potential rise of a third party within the void created by bipartisan extremism. Most important, Chafee sounds a wake-up call to his Party, and to all Americans, by challenging our government to strive, as Abraham Lincoln once articulated, \u201cto elevate the condition of men.\u201d",

Nine years later, her disappearance on an around-the - world flight brought her extraordinary life to an abrupt and mysterious end.Based on a decade of archival research through Earhart's letters, journals, and diaries, and drawing on interviews with the aviator's friends and relatives, East to the Dawn provides the most authoritative and richly textured account of both Earhart's record-setting aviation career and her personal life: her early years with her grandparents, her experiences as a nurse and social worker, her famous marriage to publisher George Putnam, and her secret affair with Gene Vidal, head of the Bureau of Air Commerce. As the Los Angeles Times raved, East to the Dawn is \"a fully realized portrait of a truly remarkable woman.\"\"The mountain of new material it marshals guarantees East to the Dawn a permanent place on the shelf of Amelia Earhart references.\"\u00f9NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW",

        "Description": "Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop was the largest landowner and richest woman in the Hawaiian kingdom. Upon her death in 1884, she entrusted her property--known as Bishop Estate--to five trustees in order to create and maintain an institution that would benefit the children of Hawai\u2018i: Kamehameha Schools. A century later, Bishop Estate controlled nearly one out of every nine acres in the state, a concentration of private land ownership rarely seen anywhere in the world. Then in August 1997 the unthinkable happened: Four revered kupuna (native Hawaiian elders) and a professor of trust-law publicly charged Bishop Estate trustees with gross incompetence and massive trust abuse. Entitled \"Broken Trust,\" the statement provided devastating details of rigged appointments, violated trusts, cynical manipulation of the trust\u2019s beneficiaries, and the shameful involvement of many of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s powerful.No one is better qualified to examine the events and personalities surrounding the scandal than two of the original \"Broken Trust\" authors. Their comprehensive account together with historical background, brings to light information that has never before been made public, including accounts of secret meetings and communications involving Supreme Court justices.",

        "Title": "The Secrets of Economic Indicators: Hidden Clues to Future Economic Trends and Investment Opportunities, 2nd Edition",
        "Authors": "By Baumohl, Bernard",
        "Description": "\u201cThis is the real deal. Baumohl miraculously breathes life into economic indicators and statistics.\u201d  \u2013The Wall Street Journal      \u201cThis is the most up-to-date guide to economic indicators and their importance to financial markets in print. The coverage of less-reported indicators, especially those from nongovernment sources, is hard to find elsewhere. The inclusion of the actual published tables helps the newer student of the markets find the data in the public release. For anyone trying to follow the economic data, this should be next to your computer so that you can understand and find the data on the Internet.\u201d  \u2013David Wyss, Chief Economist, Standard and Poor\u2019s     \u201cI find Baumohl\u2019s writing fascinating. In addition to the famous indicators, he includes many that I hadn\u2019t heard of. I really appreciate that he tells you exactly where to find each indicator on the Web. Just about anyone who\u2019s serious about understanding which way the economy is headed will want to read this book. It could be a classic.\u201d  \u2013Harry Domash, Columnist for MSN Money and Publisher, Winning Investing Newsletter      \u201cBernie Baumohl has accomplished something of real value in The Secrets of Economic Indicators. He has successfully demystified the world of financial and economic news that bombards us in our daily lives. Both professional investors and casual observers of the world of finance and economics will be grateful for what he has done. The constant stream of heretofore bewildering news from the world of business and finance can now be easily understood. Every businessperson or investor should keep a copy of Baumohl\u2019s book close at hand as he or she catches up on the business, stock market, and economic events of the day. It is great, at long last, to have someone who has eliminated what may have been so perplexing to so many and to have done so with such remarkable clarity.\u201d  \u2013Hugh Johnson, Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of Johnson Illington Advisors       \u201cBernie Baumohl has written a must-read educational and reference book that every individual investor will find indispensable for watching, monitoring, and interpreting the markets. The daily flow of high frequency economic indicators is the stuff that makes financial markets move and that can signal the big trends that make or break investor portfolios. Most important, Bernie\u2019s long experience in reporting economics for Time Magazine helps make the \u2018dismal science\u2019 lively and interesting.\u201d  \u2013Allen Sinai, President and Chief Global Economist, Decision Economics, Inc.     \u201cBaumohl has a gift for taking a complicated subject and allowing it to read like a fast-moving novel. My confidence in reading and understanding economic indicators as portrayed in this book made me realize the possibilities this information holds for improving my personal net worth as well as navigating my business toward higher profits. I recommend this book if you care about your future finances.\u201d  \u2013Morris E. Lasky, CEO, Lodging Unlimited, Inc.; Manager and consultant for $6 billion in hotel assets; Chairman, Lodging Conference; Chairman, International Hotel Conference     \u201cI think this is an excellent book. It\u2019s well written, accessible to a variety of readers, deals with an interesting and important subject, and covers the topic well. It deserves to get a lot of notice and use.\u201d  \u2013D.

        "Description": "The experience of war has affected every generation in the 20th and 21st century. Every soldier has a story to tell, and since the year 2000 the Veteran's History Project, a new permanent department of the Library of Congress, has been carefully collecting and preserving the memories of the veterans of all wars. The collection is astonishing in its scope. In addition to more than 50,000 recorded oral histories, the VHP has amassed thousands of letters, photographs, scrapbooks, and invaluable mementos from nearly a century of warfare.In the first book to showcase the richness and depth of this collection historian TK has organized the book into chapters by themes common to all war experiences: Basic Training, First Combat, Courage, Special Bonds, Fate, Fun, and Coming Home. Short introductory essays introduce each topic, but historian TK then allows the veterans their chance to speak, deftly interweaving the letters, photographs, sketches, and pages of compelling oral history of U.S. veterans' experiences in World War I and II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. Brief connecting passages provide background information where necessary.    Readers will discover the extraordinary memoirs of men like John Casper Wister, a so-called \"ordinary soldier\" who vividly described army life in World War I and tried to warn his fellow soldiers about Germany's threat in the years following the war. They'll experience the courage of soldiers like Bruce Fenchel, who fought all five of the major battles of Europe under the command of General Patton. Blasted in a tank explosion at Chaumont, he hung onto a gas truck with frozen hands long enough to be dropped at a Belgian family home and pub, where he was hidden in the attic. After fierce battles at Bastogne and the Rhine River, he witnessed terrifying sites of torture apparatus and death when his division liberated the Ohrdurf Concentration Camp. They'll meet Red Cross worker Peggy Henry, who was plunged into a harrowing story of survival during the Battle of the Bulge when she and two local women had to flee the advancing German army under cover of darkness. They'll read about the bonds of brotherhood experienced by Walter Morris, who trained the Army's first all-black paratrooper unit. They'll read about families and sweethearts on the homefront, and share the remarkable stories of \"ordinary\" wives like Margerie Gufein, who each month during World War II and the Korean War created a handmade \"Goofein Journal\" to update her husband on family happenings. Photographs of these touching homemade newspapers illustrate the text. They'll share the extraordinary story of a husband and wife who volunteered to go to Vietnam together rather than be separated by the draft, and meet Rod Hinsh, an army special forces fighter assigned to the highly unusual task of guarding USO performer Martha Ray during the Vietnam War. Twenty-three years after the war, Ray vividly recalled their first meeting. They'll also see how the legacy of war continues in the modern world, experiencing how the story of was has changed with emails, digital photographs, and embedded journalists. And finally they'll read the heartwarming tale of Ray Shipley, a veteran of World War II and Korea, who each day for the past two months has been rising at 6am to go to BWI airport to extend a handshake and free phone cards to soldiers returning from Iraq on leave. Though he has no official authority, he carries their bags, points them to their connecting flight, and never forgets to say \"welcome home.\"    Through the diverse stories collected in this volume emerges the moving story of America at war. This is a book that will provoke memories and thoughtful reflection and truly celebrate the sacrifices made by the millions of veterans who have fought to defend our freedom.
