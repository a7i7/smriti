        "Title": "Word Fugitives: In Pursuit of Wanted Words",
        "Authors": "By Wallraff, Barbara",
        "Description": "Despite the many thousands of dictionary words at our disposal, our language can be dismayingly inadequate. How many times have you searched for a word that means just what you want it to but failed to find anything suitable anywhere? Most of us, it turns out, lead lives rife with experiences, people, and things that have no names.At least, they lacked names until now. Word Fugitives comes to the rescue, supplying hundreds of inspired words coined or redefined to meet everyday needs. For instance, wouldn't it be handy to have a word for the momentary confusion people experience when they hear a cell phone ringing and wonder whether it's theirs? (How about fauxcellarm, phonundrum, or pandephonium?)Or what about a word for offspring who are adults? (Try unchildren or offsprung.) Or a word for the irrational fear when you're throwing a party that no one will show up? (That might be guestlessness, empty-fest syndrome, or fete-alism.)This mind- and vocabulary-expanding book grew out -- way out -- of Barbara Wallraff's popular column in The Atlantic Monthly. Brimming with irresistible diversions and pop quizzes; illuminated by contributions and commentary from authors, linguists, and leading language authorities; and enlivened by pleas for help from people whose words have yet to be found, Word Fugitives will captivate and inspire anyone who ever struggles to describe the world that he or she, or they, or thon (thon? see page 141) lives in.",

        "Title": "The Bush Agenda: Invading the World, One Economy at a Time",
        "Authors": "By Juhasz, Antonia",
        "Description": "The Bush Agenda is the first book to expose the Bush Administration's radical economic agenda for global domination, a plan more extreme, unilateral and audacious than any of his predecessors, a plan that has created the greatest level of violent opposition to America and Americans in recent history.The Bush Agenda: Invading the World, One Economy at a Time explores the Bush Administration's plan to invade the world through a corporate globalization agenda, first in Iraq, then the Middle East with the proposed U.S.-Middle East Free Trade Area, and ultimately as a cornerstone to the global Bush Doctrine of Pax Americana. What is Bush's \"free trade?\" It's an economic model that argues that by removing restrictions on multinational corporations, these companies will be freed to become engines of economic growth in countries around the world, but in fact bring vast wealth of a small number of global elites while entire populations suffer dislocation, poverty and violence, creating a perfect Petri dish for breeding terrorists. The instruments for this takeover include such corporations as Bechtel, Lockheed Martin, ChevronTexaco, Halliburton, and many others. This book addresses the history of U.S. economic relations throughout the world over the past 25 years, the key role of U.S. corporations, and the larger Bush economic agenda and what the potential impact of this agenda will be on the United States and the world. It concludes with specific alternatives to guide the U.S. on a more peaceful and sustainable course in the future. Using Naomi Klein's No Logo and Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation as models, The Bush Agenda is based on hard analytic fact and presented so that it will not only be persuasive, but highly engaging and entertaining to a broad audience.",

Now, in this fifteenth mystery in her much-beloved Faith Fairchild series, she takes us to the blustery slopes of a Vermont ski resort, where murder makes an unwelcome appearance at the Fairchild family reunion.When caterer Faith Fairchild learns of her father-in-law\u2019s plan to celebrate his seventieth birthday by treating his children, their spouses, and his grandchildren to a weeklong stay at the Pine Slopes resort, her reaction is mixed. Yes, she likes to ski and yes, she loves the kin of her husband, the Reverend Thomas Fairchild, but both in smaller and shorter doses.The Fairchilds have been coming to the ski area since Tom and his siblings were toddlers and are old friends of the owners, the Staffords. All starts well as the family settles into neighboring condos, until Faith discovers a body on one of the cross-country trails -- the apparent victim of a heart attack. Then Pine Slopes' star chef vanishes without a trace. One catastrophe follows another: a malicious prank at the sports center, a break-in at the Fairchild condo, and one of the chairlifts is sabotaged. Who is the mysterious woman living in the \"gingerbread cottage\" deep in the woods? And what are adolescents Ophelia Stafford and Faith's nephew Scott -- filled with angst and anger -- up to? Family secrets abound and family dynamics explode.Then one morning skiers arrive and are horror-stricken to find the slopes covered with patches of red snow, the result of a body falling, or being pushed, into the water supply for the snow-making guns.

        "Description": "The literary debut of the funniest and most incisive new voice to come along since Michael Moore-and the acclaimed director of the film phenomenon of the year.  Can man live on fast food alone? Morgan Spurlock tried to do just that. For thirty days, he ate nothing but three \"squares\" a day from McDonald's as part of an investigation into the effects of fast food on American health. The resulting documentary won him resounding applause and a worldwide release that broke box-office records. Audiences were captivated by Spurlock's experiment, during which he gained twenty-five pounds, his blood pressure skyrocketed, and his libido all but disappeared.  But this story goes far beyond Spurlock's good-humored \"Mc-Sickness.\" He traveled across the country-into schools, hospitals, and people's homes -to investigate school lunch programs, the marketing of fast food, and the declining emphasis on health and physical education. He looks at why fast food is so tasty, cheap, and ultimately seductive, and what Americans can do to turn the rising tide of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes that have accompanied its ever-growing popularity. He interviewed experts in twenty U.S. cities-from surgeon generals and kids to lawmakers and marketing gurus-who share their research, opinions, and \"gut feelings\" on our ever-expanding girth and what we can all do to offset a health crisis of supersized proportions.  In this groundbreaking, hilarious book, \"benevolent muckraker\" Morgan Spurlock debuts a wry investigative voice that will appeal to anyone interested in the health of our country, our children, and ourselves.",

They say that Falun Gong has become a dangerous threat to the largest nation on Earth. In a return to the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, they have burned thousands of Falun Gong books and literature. They have beaten and detained thousands of practitioners. They have issued an arrest warrant for Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi. They are sentencing some practioners to long periods of incarceration at show trials. World leaders and human rights groups are speaking out.Why is this happening? Is it because Falun Gong has attracted an estimated l00 million practitioners? What is Falun Gong's appeal? What is it that China fears?This is their story. Largely Unheard. Until Now.This timely non-fiction book presents the inside story of China's crackdown on Falun Gong, taking a stand against the most blatant and pervasive political book burning since the days of Hitler's rise to power. By offering Falun Gong's story in the context of the current crisis in China, it provides an important look at a dramatic underreported and unfolding story. In China, their point of view has been banned. It deserves to be heard worldwide.Veteran journalist Danny Schechter executive produced \"China Now\" for Channel 13 in 1991.

They're from all walks of life; and then on the other side you've got this picture that the Chinese government is painting, and the two just don't match.\"-Adam Montanaro, Falun Gong practitioner (USA)",

She recounts the myths of Arthur and his knights in the authentic voices of the medieval authors.Brimming with art from illuminated manuscripts, woodcuts, paintings, and sculptures, supported by boxed essays focusing on the archetypal historical, literary, and legendary background, Chronicles of King Arthur is a rich tapestry of language and imagery, a delight for anyone who again wants to read these great captivating myths of the Western world.",

In her quest for the sources of feminine representation, Ussher  interviewed dozens of women - as well as some men - and combed popular  media - from Seventeen to Cosmopolitan and Dallas to Donahue - to  identify what shapes women's symbolic images of sex and femininity.  Ussher argues that women have effectively resisted and subverted these  archetypal fantasies of femininity, and in the process of so doing,  reframed the very boundaries of sex. In this way, she exposes as myth  much of what we think we know about \"woman\" and about \"sex.\"",

        "Description": "He played in casinos around the world with a plan to make himself richer than anyone could possibly imagine -- but it would nearly cost him his life.Semyon Dukach was known as the Darling of Las Vegas. A legend at age twenty-one, this cocky hotshot was the biggest high roller to appear in Sin City in decades, a mathematical genius with a system the casinos had never seen before and couldn't stop -- a system that has never been revealed until now; that has nothing to do with card counting, wasn't illegal, and was more powerful than anything that had been tried before.Las Vegas. Atlantic City. Aruba. Barcelona. London. And the jewel of the gambling crown -- Monte Carlo.Dukach and his fellow MIT students hit them all and made millions. They came in hard, with stacks of cash; big, seemingly insane bets; women hanging on their arms; and fake identities. Although they were taking classes and studying for exams during the week, over the weekends they stormed the blackjack tables only to be harassed, banned from casinos, threatened at gunpoint, and beaten in Vegas's notorious back rooms.The stakes were high, the dangers very real, but the players were up to the challenges, consequences be damned. There was Semyon Dukach himself, bored with school and broke; Victor Cassius, the slick, brilliant MIT grad student who galvanized the team; Owen Keller, with stunning ability but a dark past that would catch up to him; and Allie Simpson, bright, clever, and a feast for the eyes.In the classroom, they were geeks. On the casino floor, they were unstoppable.Busting Vega$ is Dukach's unbelievably true story; a riveting account of monumental greed, excess, hubris, sex, love, violence, fear, and statistics that is high-stakes entertainment at its best.",

It has been a life of family picnics, books and wine, a cherished house, and her own exquisitely designed garden\u2014sunny and comfortable. But then the carefully managed life to which Rose has become accustomed comes crashing down around her when\u2014over the course of a few days\u2014her marriage and her career both fall apart.   Can Rose, whose anguish is barely softened by the ministrations of friends and grown children with their own problems, ever start over? Not easily.

Especially when an old flame suddenly reappears.   Full of humor, clever insight, and a whimsical sense of the absurd, Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman is an irresistible and finely written fantasy for anyone who ever wondered what a certain age would look like from beyond the looking-glass-and who will find it ripe with promise that the best days are yet to come.",

And Vernon, as his only buddy, has become the focus of the town's need for vengeance.The news of the tragedy has resulted in the quirky backwater being flooded with wannabe CNN hacks all-too-keen to claim their fifteen minutes and lay the blame for the killings at Vernon's feet.

The book features more than two dozen veterans from all military branches, from fighter pilots, nurses, medics, and foot soldiers to prison guards, POWs, and reservists, each accompanied by a compelling photograph. Together they comprise a group portrait of American men and women located all over the country and from all age, race, and socioeconomic groups -- men and women whose voices, surprisingly, are rarely heard in the din of discussion on this endlessly analyzed subject. They speak from veterans' hospitals, homes, army bases, and homeless shelters. While their viewpoints are as diverse as their backgrounds -- some supportive, some opposing, some simply confused -- \"In Conflict\" captures one thing these eloquent commentators share: all have been irrevocably changed by their experience.",

        "Title": "Duane's Depressed",
        "Authors": "By McMurtry, Larry",
        "Description": "Funny, sad, full of wonderful characters and the word-perfect dialogue of which he is the master, Larry McMurtry's new novel is the final and eagerly awaited volume of the trilogy that now includes The Last Picture Show (one of his most acclaimed and beloved novels), Texasville, and Duane's Depressed.  Set in Thalia, Texas, the small town that McMurtry literally put on the map when he wrote The Last Picture Show (and that bears a more than passing resemblance to his own hometown, Archer City), Duane's Depressed follows those of the characters who have survived into their twilight years.  In The Last Picture Show and the books that follow, McMurtry has created a cast that has achieved instant recognition, both in print and on the screen -- Duane and his friend and rival, Sonny, both high school seniors in the small and shrinking oil patch town of Thalia, obsessed with sex and touchingly vulnerable behind a facade of teenage toughness; Jacy, the prettiest (and richest) girl in town, who survives small-town teenage sex to become a movie star; Ruth Popper, the sadly romantic wife of Coach Popper; Jacy's hell-raising mother; Karla, who later marries Duane; Lester, the high school geek who goes on to become the town banker and eventually does time in prison for writing up inappropriate loans -- all with a life of their own, as rich and as surprising as only Larry McMurtry could imagine.  Now, in Duane's Depressed, McMurtry brings the Thalia saga to an end with Duane confronting depression in the midst of plenty. Surrounded by his children, who all seem to be going through life crises involving sex, drugs, and violence; his wife, Karla, who is wrestling with her own demons; and friends like Sonny, who seem to be dying, Duane can't seem to make sense of his life anymore, and shocks his loved ones and the local countryside by giving up his pickup truck to go on foot (and later by bike) -- a sign of depression (if not madness) by local community standards -- which will soon lead him to abandon Karla and his family and emulate Thoreau, and will eventually make him a patient of Dr. Honor Carmichael, a lesbian psychoanalyst who has put out her shingle in Wichita Falls and with whom Duane falls inappropriately in love, and to make a friend of Gay-lee, a whore who lives near him in the hellish motel he has chosen to stay in when not in his rustic cabin, and to whom Duane gives Shorty, his Queensland blue heeler and companion, as he gradually makes his way through a protracted end-of-life crisis in which he is finally cured by reading Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, a combination of penance and prescription from Dr. Carmichael that somehow works.  Here is McMurtry's strongest and most appealing \"contemporary\" novel since the much acclaimed Terms of Endearment -- the work of a powerful, mature artist, with a deep understanding of the human condition, a profound ability to write about small-town life, and perhaps the surest touch of any American novelist for the tangled feelings that bind and separate men and women.  Utterly unsentimental, often hilarious, sometimes tragic and shocking, and in the end full of hope, Duane's Depressed is one of McMurtry's strongest novels, a major work of art by any standard.",

Here are reports on failed nation-building missions in Kabul and Baghdad. Here, too, the story of a rancher who has fallen prey to a Bush-Cheney interior department that is perhaps a wee bit too cozy with the oil industry. Bushwhacked is highly original and entirely thought-provoking\u2014essential reading for anyone living in George W. Bush's America.",

        "Description": "\"Friendship matters to women; it matters a lot; women today -- with lives often in transition -- depend on friends more than ever. Many who once believed marriage was the center of life...now know that friends may be the difference between a lonely life and a lively one.\"  In I Know Just What You Mean, Pulitzer prize-winning columnist Ellen Goodman and novelist/journalist Patricia O'Brien provide a thoughtful, deeply personal look at the enduring bonds of friendship between women. Friends for over a quarter of a century, they bring to their book the unique mix of insight and humor that only such a long and rich relationship can produce.  \"You might say we've been writing this book for twenty-six years. Maybe it's the logical outcome for two writing friends. It amazes us now to look back and see what we've been building: the story of our friendship is the story of our divorces, our children, careers, loves, losses, remarriages.We rarely made a move without each other's opinion or listening ear...We moved from youth through middle-age with the requisite accumulation of both wisdom and caution that -- when shared -- made each of us stronger than we would have been alone.\"  Drawing on interviews with numerous women from all stages of life -- teenagers, young mothers, elderly women, women in politic and business, sports and media celebrities -- the authors reach beyond their own experiences, providing an intimate look at friendships that begin everywhere from kindergarten to nursing homes. They tell the touching, funny, and sometimes painful stories of women who don't shy away from confronting the problems and demands of friendship.  \"When we asked women how they defined what a close friend is, they leaped past such qualifiers to describe the impact: being known and accepted, understood to the core; trust and loyalty you can count on, having someone on your side. Having someone to share worries and secrets as well as the good stuff of life. Someone who needs you in return.\"  The authors explore the problems of famous friends -- how do you stay close when your best friend is one of the richest and most powerful women in the world? They write about friendships that have endured through hardship and misfortune, survived the problems of competing with each other. Looking through history and Hollywood, real life and fiction, they get to the heart of relationships between women.  \"Somewhere in the meaning of the word 'trust' is the assumption that a friend has your best interest at heart. Friends can be the collaborators, the instigators who make change possible. They are often the ones who urge us to take a leap, who jump with us or help us scramble back up the other side.\"  Throughout the book, there is an ongoing dialogue between Goodman and O'Brien that is sure to resonate with every woman who cherishes her female friends. \"Talk is at the very heart of women's friendship, the core of the way women connect. It's the given, the absolute assumption of friendship. It can be serious or funny, painful or exuberant, intense or joyous. But at the heart of the connections made is one sentence that women repeat over and over: 'I know just what you mean.'\"",

Growing up in a loving and supportive middle-class family in Washington, DC, in the &#39;60s, Naomi Jefferson worries about what to wear, her bra size and meeting boys, and she has dreams of one day opening her own clothing store. While she knows racism is a problem (occasional brushes with the uglier side of people don&#39;t let her forget it), Naomi is, at heart, just like any other teenage girl.  All of that changes when Joshua, Naomi&#39;s older brother, is killed in an accident on his way to a civil rights demonstration in Chicago. Racism becomes a personal issue, and Naomi decides that she needs to help bring about changes in the system. At college in Atlanta, she becomes immersed in politics, organizing protests and butting heads with school administrations as well as with her boyfriend, who isn&#39;t too friendly to the cause. Disillusioned by authority figures and betrayed by the man she loves, Naomi returns home, confused about the world and her place in it. Witty, sensitive, bittersweet and triumphant, Big Girls Don&#39;t Cry is a compelling portrait of a woman who refuses to compromise her standards -- cloudy as they may be at times -- in her quest for satisfaction. In Big Girls Don&#39;t Cry, Briscoe has created a heroine and a story to which any woman who has faced the frustrations of glass ceilings, the pain of loss and sacrifice and the perils and pleasures of love will immediately relate.",

        "Description": "One of the best-known, most frequently performed of modern plays, A Doll's House richly displays the genius with which Henrik Ibsen pioneered modern, realistic prose drama. In the central character of Nora, Ibsen epitomized the human struggle against the humiliating constraints of social conformity. Nora's ultimate rejection of a smothering marriage and life in \"a doll's house\" shocked theatergoers of the late 1800s and opened new horizons for playwrights and their audiences.But daring social themes are only one aspect of Ibsen's power as a dramatist. A Doll's House shows as well his gifts for creating realistic dialogue, a suspenseful flow of events and, above all, psychologically penetrating characterizations that make the struggles of his dramatic personages utterly convincing. Here is a deeply absorbing play as readable as it is eminently playable, reprinted from an authoritative translation.",

Armani! Versace! at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about \u201cThe Boss from Hell.\u201d Narrated in Andrea\u2019s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda\u2019s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day\u2014and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone.

It was a crucial friendship, and a unique one\u2014a president  and a prime minister spending enormous amounts of time together (113 days during  the war) and exchanging nearly two thousand messages. Amid cocktails, cigarettes,  and cigars, they met, often secretly, in places as far-flung as Washington, Hyde  Park, Casablanca, and Teheran, talking to each other of war, politics, the burden  of command, their health, their wives, and their children. Born in the nineteenth  century and molders of the twentieth and twenty-first, Roosevelt and Churchill had  much in common. Sons of the elite, students of history, politicians of the first  rank, they savored power. In their own time both men were underestimated, dismissed  as arrogant, and faced skeptics and haters in their own nations\u2014yet both magnificently  rose to the central challenges of the twentieth century. Theirs was a kind of love  story, with an emotional Churchill courting an elusive Roosevelt. The British prime  minister, who rallied his nation in its darkest hour, standing alone against Adolf  Hitler, was always somewhat insecure about his place in FDR\u2019s affections\u2014which was  the way Roosevelt wanted it. A man of secrets, FDR liked to keep people off balance,  including his wife, Eleanor, his White House aides\u2014and Winston Churchill. Confronting  tyranny and terror, Roosevelt and Churchill built a victorious alliance amid cataclysmic  events and occasionally conflicting interests. Franklin and Winston is also the story  of their marriages and their families, two clans caught up in the most sweeping global  conflict in history. Meacham\u2019s new sources\u2014including unpublished letters of FDR\u2019 s great secret love, Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, the papers of Pamela Churchill Harriman,  and interviews with the few surviving people who were in FDR and Churchill\u2019s joint  company\u2014shed fresh light on the characters of both men as he engagingly chronicles  the hours in which they decided the course of the struggle. Hitler brought them  together; later in the war, they drifted apart, but even in the autumn of their alliance,  the pull of affection was always there. Charting the personal drama behind the discussions  of strategy and statecraft, Meacham has written the definitive account of the most  remarkable friendship of the modern age.",

Stopping to rest at the Italian village of Bolzano, Casanova secures a loan to rebuild his life, and resumes his art of seduction. But there is another reason he has come to this particular village: the memory of a duel he fought long ago with the duke of Parma over a girl named Francesca. Casanova lost the fight; Francesca became the duke\u2019s wife; and the duke spared Casanova\u2019s life on condition that he never set eyes on her again. The village of Bolzano is part of the duke\u2019s lands. Now an old man, the duke arrives at the inn with a love letter he has intercepted from his wife to Casanova. He could kill Casanova on the spot but instead makes him an irresistible offer, one that will ultimately be the downfall of the notorious lover. Brimming with the richness and psychological tension that made Embers an international best seller, Casanova in Bolzano is further proof that S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai stands among the twentieth century\u2019s greatest literary voices.",
