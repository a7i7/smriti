LewisLike Lewis, Jarrett Stevens wants to truly know and experience God, not some distorted and destructive image of the Almighty formed over the years. With wry humor and profound insights, Stevens searches to align his broken images of God with the images of God found in the Bible. Attempting to recapture the spirit of J. B. Phillips' classic, Your God Is Too Small, Stevens addresses various assumptions we have about God and sorts through twelve different views of God---six destructive and six constructive. God is not, for instance, the cop around the corner waiting to catch you breaking the law. Neither is he a talent show judge, wincing as you struggle through life. What if those destructive images we've shaped were replaced with more positive ones---a neighbor you can call for help in the dead of night ... or a tired-eyed father waiting for his child to return home safely? These images come straight from Jesus' teachings and invite us into a new experience with the true and living God.",

Parents, teachers, bosses, and institutions all   give less encouragement to women than men, and women still grow up believing that   they must defer to men in order be seen as feminine.  If their ambition does survive   into adulthood, too often those ambitions must be downsized or abandoned to accommodate   \u201cwifely\u201d duties of household chores and child care.   As a result, women--unlike   men\u2013continually have to re-shape their goals and expectations. Yet expressing ambition,   pursuing it, and getting recognition for one\u2019s accomplishments is critical to identity   and happiness.  In this groundbreaking work, Anna Fels draws on extensive research   and years of her psychiatriac practice to offer an original and deeply useful examination   of ambition in women\u2019s lives.  In the process, she illuminates just what is necessary   for women to articulate--and fulfill--their dreams.",

        "Description": "Early one morning in New York City, Will Heller, a sixteen-yearold paranoid schizophrenic, gets on an uptown B train alone. Like most people he knows, Will believes the world is being destroyed by climate change; unlike most people, he\u2019s convinced he can do something about it. Unknown to his doctors, unknown to the police\u2014unknown even to Violet Heller, his devoted mother\u2014Will alone holds the key to the planet\u2019s salvation. To cool down the world, he has to cool down his own overheating body: to cool down his body, he has to find one willing girl. And he already has someone in mind.  Lowboy, John Wray\u2019s third novel, tells the story of Will\u2019s fantastic and terrifying odyssey through the city\u2019s tunnels, back alleys, and streets in search of Emily Wallace, his one great hope, and of Violet Heller\u2019s desperate attempts to locate her son before psychosis claims him completely. She is joined by Ali Lateef, a missing-persons specialist, who gradually comes to discover that more is at stake than the recovery of a runaway teen: Violet\u2014beautiful, enigmatic, and as profoundly at odds with the world as her son\u2014harbors a secret that Lateef will discover at his own peril.  Suspenseful and comic, devastating and hopeful by turns, Lowboy is a fearless exploration of youth, sex, and violence in contemporary America, seen through one boy\u2019s haunting and extraordinary vision.",

        "Description": "Unlike their counterparts on the high school or elementary school level, those who teach college students have extensive training in their various disciplines, but surprisingly little instruction in the craft of teaching itself. The Chicago Handbook for Teachers is an extraordinarily helpful guide for all those who face the challenge of putting together material for a course and then making it work. Representing teachers at all stages of their careers, the authors, including distinguished historian Alan Brinkley, offer practical advice for almost any situation a new teacher might face, from preparing a syllabus to managing classroom dynamics. Beginning with a nuts and bolts plan for designing a course, the handbook also explains how to lead a discussion, evaluate your own teaching, deliver an effective lecture, supervise students' writing and research, create and grade exams, and more. Other sections address the less straightforward aspects of teaching, such as dealing with \"diversity issues\" and knowing where to draw the line in relationships with students. Particularly timely is an up-to-date discussion of when and how best to incorporate the Internet and other electronic resources into your teaching. Indispensable for graduate students and new teachers, The Chicago Handbook for Teachers is also a useful refresher for the experienced professionals.",

There was too much bad blood between the Coalition and the Horde and, for intensely personal reasons, Brit wasn't sure that she was through spilling it!  But now a peaceful accord had made Finn Rorkken, a notorious Drakken rogue, second in command on her starship, and--through some grand cosmic irony--front and center in her thoughts...and her heart. Warleader. Pirate.Either title sat easily on Finn's battle-hardened shoulders.  Though second in command to \"Stone-Heart\" Bandar? That one would take some getting used to. Peace required as much sacrifice as war so he'd comply even if his reaction to the gorgeous admiral fell decidedly outside protocol. But would he end up kissing or killing her if the galaxy's tentative truce turned into all-out war?",
