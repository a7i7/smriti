        "Authors": "By Miller, Sue and Kenison, Kartina (EDT)",
        "Description": "Since its inception in 1915, the Best American series has become the premier annual showcase for the country's finest short fiction and nonfiction. For each volume, a series editor reads pieces from hundreds of periodicals, then selects between fifty and a hundred outstanding works. That selection is pared down to the twenty or so very best pieces by a guest editor who is widely recognized as a leading writer in his or her field. This unique system has helped make the Best American series the most respected -- and most popular -- of its kind.This year's Best American Short Stories features a rich mix of voices, from both intriguing new writers and established masters of the form like Michael Chabon, Edwidge Danticat, Richard Ford, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Arthur Miller. The 2002 collection includes stories about everything from illicit love affairs to family, the immigrant experience and badly behaved children -- stories varied in subject but unified in their power and humanity. In the words of this year's guest editor, the best-selling author Sue Miller, \"The American short story today [is] healthy and strong . . . These stories arrived in the nick of time . . . to teach me once more what we read fiction for.\"",

        "Authors": "By Chapman, Audrey B.",
        "Description": "As a family and relationship therapist for fifteen years, Audrey Chapman has witnessed firsthand the battle that is raging between African-American men and women. Women are tired of bearing the burden, emotionally and economically, for the \"ills\" of the black community. Men feel dominated and overshadowed by these same women, and devise outrageous games of subterfuge to wrest control and mask their own vulnerability. Both feel bitter toward a society that thwarts the attainment of their goals while criticizing them for not doing better. The result: a vicious cycle of expectation and disappointment that poisons the ground for loving connections.In Entitled to Good Loving, Chapman explains that this struggle between partners in fact reflects an individual's internal conflict - one entailing control, emotional deprivation, the need for nurturance, and a sense of powerlessness - the roots of which can be traced to family structures and societal attitudes. Through numerous case studies featuring intimate revelations from both men and women, Chapman shows how a sense of \"entitlement\" - about how one's love partner should make up for one's past - can lead to unrealistic expectations and even destructive behavior.",

        "Description": "Now available as an audio CD, in Eudora Welty's own voice, or as a book.Eudora Welty was born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi. In a \"continuous thread of revelation\" she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection: the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction.Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South--of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught--would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance. Until publication of this book, she had discouraged biographical investigations. It undoubtedly was not easy for this shy and reticent lady to undertake her own literary biography, to relive her own memories (painful as well as pleasant), to go through letters and photographs of her parents and grandparents. But we are in her debt, for the distillation of experience she offers us is a rare pleasure for her admirers, a treat to everyone who loves good writing and anyone who is interested in the seeds of creativity.",

Moved by Pipher's insight yet driven to hear the unfiltered voices of today's adolescent girls, Shandler yearned to speak for herself, and to provide a forum for other Ophelias to do so as well. A poignant collection of original pieces selected from more than eighthundred contributions, Ophelia Speaks culls writings from the hearts of girls nationwide, of various races, religions, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Ranging in age from twelve to eighteen, the voices here offer a provocative and piercingly real view on issues public and private, from body image to boys, politics to parents, school to sex. Framing each chapter are Shandler's own personal reflections, offering both the comfort of a trusted friend and an honest perspective from within the whirlwind of adolescence. In these pages, you will see your best friend, your daughter, your sister--and yourself. At once filled with heartbreak and hope, in these pages Ophelia speaks.",

With dazzling wit and acuity, three-time Pulitzer Prize finalist Leslie Savan dissects contemporary language to discover what our most popular idioms reveal about America today. She traces the paths that words and expressions travel from obscurity to ubiquity.  She describes how \u201creal people\u201d create slang and colorful phrases (I don\u2019t think so; Bring it on!; Dude; Outside the box); how the media, advertising, politics, and business mine the language for these phrases in order to better sell products, ideas, and personalities; and how these expressions, now that they\u2019ve hit the big time, then burst out of our mouths as \u201ccelebrity words,\u201d newly glamorous and persuasive.  Words like Duh! and Whatever have become such an indispensable form of communication that they\u2019re replacing our need to articulate any real thought. Whether it\u2019s George Tenet convincing George W. Bush that finding WMD in Iraq would be \u201ca slam dunk\u201d or Microsoft telling you that its latest software is a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d this bright, snappy language affects us all\u2013up close and personal.Smart, dynamic, and great fun, Slam Dunks and No-Brainers is\u2013for everyone who loves the mysteries and idiosyncrasies of language\u2013well, a no-brainer.",

Bowing to an urgent summons from his former lover, Justin de Quincy hastens to Paris only to find that the Lady Claudine was, in fact, acting on behalf of his nemesis Prince John. As the Queen's man, de Quincy has already encountered John's murderous side. But now John tells him of a document implicating him in a plot to kill his brother, King Richard. The document is a forgery, and, despite his hunger for the crown, John is innocent of the charge. Still, a brother who looked with amiable contempt at John's earlier intrigues would hardly risk regicide. John must find the forger and prove the document false before Richard hears of it, and he entreats Justin to help him.  It takes more than John's wily charms to persuade Justin: It is only when he realizes that the welfare of the woman he serves, Eleanor of Aquitaine, is also at risk that Justin concedes. It is a concession that will take him to a bloody chamber on Mont-Saint-Michel, to a stinking dungeon in Brittany, to a murderous encounter in a Paris cemetery, and, ultimately, to the unraveling of a conspiracy that might have changed the course of history.",

B. Blakey, co-owner of a Tulsa, Oklahoma, hardware store, was thirty-three and had broken off an engagement with a local beauty. Having second thoughts, he went to Enid, Oklahoma, to see her at the home of friends - and one Josie Walker opened the door.B.B. and Josie would write over seven hundred letters to each other over the next year and a half as they fell deeply in love. As Josie traveled through a more innocent America, B.B.'s letters marked \"Personal\" and \"Special Delivery\" found her in small towns and train stops. Now this wonderful exchange of writing, so filled with the joy of discovering each other, is collected here by B.B. and Jo's granddaughter, award-winning photographer Keri Pickett. Along with their commentary on love, marriage, and family, she shows us a relationship most people only dream about - and to which all of us aspire.",

In Home from Nowhere Kunstler not only shows that the original American Dream -- the desire for peaceful, pleasant places in which to work and live -- still has a strong hold on our imaginations, but also offers innovative, eminently practical ways to make that dream a reality. Citing examples from around the country, he calls for the restoration of traditional architecture, the introduction of enduring design principles in urban planning, and the development of public spaces that acknowledge our need to interact comfortable with one another.",

        "Authors": "By Lee, Robert Earl",
        "Description": "Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was one of the most notorious pirates ever to plague the Atlantic coast. He was also one of the most colorful pirates of all time, becoming the model for countless blood-and-thunder tales of sea rovers. His daring exploits, personal courage, terrifying appearance, and fourteen wives made him a legend in his own lifetime. The legends and myths about Blackbeard have become wilder rather than tamer in the 250 years since his gory but valiant death at Ocracoke Inlet. It is difficult for historians, and all but impossible for the general reader, to separate fact from fiction. Author Robert E. Lee has studied virtually every scrap of information available about the pirate and his contemporaries in an attempt to find the real Blackbeard. The result is a fascinating and authoritative study that reads like an exciting swashbuckler. Lee goes beyond the myths and the image Teach so carefully cultivated to reveal a new Blackbeard\u2014infinitely more interesting as a man than as a legend. In the process, he has captured the spirit and character of a vanished age, \"the golden age of piracy.\"Robert E. Lee was a former law professor who traced his own ancestry to a possible link with Blackbeard. A native of Kinston, North Carolina, he earned degrees from Wake Forest, Columbia, and Duke universities. The author of sixteen law books, Lee wrote the newspaper column \"This is the Law\".",

        "Title": "Faithful Travelers",
        "Authors": "By Dodson, James",
        "Description": "In Final Rounds, James Dodson told the poignant story of the golf trip of a lifetime with his terminally ill father. Now, armed with a fly-fishing rod and reel, he embarks with his seven-year-old daughter on an equally memorable journey across America in search of clear-running streams, swift elusive fish, and the eternal truths that only nature can provide.It has been said that life is what happens while you're waiting to go fishing. Only weeks after his eleven-year marriage abruptly ended in an amicable divorce, James Dodson decided to go on a fly-fishing pilgrimage west. His goal: to heal his wounded spirit and explain as best he could the vagaries of life and love to his beautiful, precocious seven-year-old daughter, Maggie.With his beat-up truck, Old Blue, and his aging retriever, Amos, Dodson and Maggie travel without plans or reservations, following where the spirit--and the lure of America's mighty rivers--leads them, on their way to one of America's grandest treasures: Yellowstone National Park. On the way, Dodson discovers a great deal about fishing, about America, and about the special relationship that exists only between a father and daughter. They travel from the Adirondacks, once a fly-angler's haven, to the mist-shrouded Niagara Falls. From the Michigan lakes where Ernest Hemingway roamed as a boy to small-town county fairs. From the majesty of Mount Rushmore to the mysticism of Harney's Peak, where Black Elk had his legendary visions, to finally the fly-fisherman's paradise of the San Juan River. Together father and daughter are bound by a tie as resilient and unpredictable as a fly-fisherman's line. For as the emotional waters in which they fish become ever more turbulent, Maggie's unspoken feelings of grief, anger, and blame begin to surface--a depth of hurt that forces Dodson to face his own unacknowledged pain and, worse, leaves him feeling helpless to make everything all right in his daughter's life again. Yet if fly-fishing has taught James Dodson anything, it is the rewards of patience, of following the wisdom of the course of the stream, the unexpected revelations reflected in still pools, and, of course, an abiding belief in plain dumb luck. With a little of each, these faithful travelers will find their way home again.Literate, honest, and deeply observant, Faithful Travelers is a beautiful meditation on the bond between parent and child and the nature of love and loss. In Faithful Travelers, James Dodson proves that sometimes life isn't what happens while you're waiting to go fishing: sometimes it happens while you're there.",

Bush It seems like too easy a target, too cheap a laugh, but Mark Crispin Miller, with the deftly trenchant wit that always distinguishes his writing, uses the blunders and malapropisms of George W. Bush to make a larger point about the way in which we elect our presidents. Miller places Bush in the context of other notorious dunces-in-chief, and shows him indisputably in a league of his own. The book is a raucously funny ridewhether it's Bush envisioning \"a foreign-handed foreign policy\" or Miller skewering vociferous cultural conservatives like William Bennett and Lynne Cheney for their silence on Bush's particular \"West Texas version of Ebonics\"but there is also a strong undercurrent of outrage. Only because our elections have become so dependent on television and its emphatic emptiness, Miller argues, can a man of such sublime and complacent ignorance assume the highest office in the land. To quote Bush himself, \"It's not the way America is all about.\"",

As he seeks to understand the events of the day his brother died, Richard finds the calm surface of his life disturbed when secrets kept by the women in his family begin to emerge.Among his bachelor brother's papers, Richard discovers a letter from his wife, Sarah, that hints at an infidelity. Shaken and confused, he finds himself tempted by an attractive woman who had known his brother. And when Richard's daughter, Anna, vulnerable after her recent divorce, becomes involved with a married man, Charles Norden, her affair changes her life and shakes the very foundation of the MacEwan family.The lives of these four characters - and the troubling legacy of James - are rendered in luminous detail and quietly breathtaking prose. A first novel that is \"old-fashioned\" in the most satisfying ways, In the Deep Midwinter presents a family and a world in crisis, a transformation as mysterious as winter becoming spring.",

But one proud young Aztec, Tenamaxtli, refuses to bow to the foreign conquerors - and secretly begins to recruit, from among the struggling survivors of the Conquest, an army of insurrection.On his courageous quest he finds high adventure, passionate women, unlikely allies, bright hope, and bitter tragedy. Driven by his dream of restoring the lost glory of the Aztec empire, he will come to threaten the seemingly invincible power of mighty Spain.Until now, Tenamaxtil's rebellion has been little remembered, perhaps because it shed no glory on the men who would write the history books, but on its outcome depended the future of all North America. Aztec Autumn re-creates this forgotten chapter of history in all its splendor.",

Set in the politically chaotic Dominican Republic of the late nineteenth century, on the campuses of three American universities, and in the idealistic Communist Cuba of the 1960s, this story is based on the real lives of a volatile, opinionated, romantic, intrigue-loving family.Salome Urena's fervent patriotic poems turned her - at seventeen - into the Dominican Republic's national icon. In stark contrast, her daughter, Camila, shy and self-effacing, bent to accommodate the demands of her father and brothers (a president, an ambassador, an international literary star) - trying to hide her preference for women, to stay out of the spotlight, and to offend no one. Whereas her mother dedicated her brief life to educating Dominican girls to serve their turbulent new nation, Camila spent her career anonymously explaining the Spanish pluperfect to upper-class American girls.We meet Camila in 1960 when she is sixty-five years old and about to retire from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. This is Camila's last chance to choose a final destiny for herself. In the process of deciding, Camila uncovers first the reality of her mother's tragic personal life and, finally, where she must place her own kind of passion and commitment.Latina poet and university professor Alvarez brings many common bonds to this novel based on \"la musa de la patria,\" Salome Urena, and her daughter, Profesora Camila Henriquez-Urena. Not the least of these is an undaunted female stance from inside a powerful Caribbean family.",

Marie Curie's shrewd though controversial insight was that radioactivity was an atomic property that could be used to discover new elements. While her work won her two Noble Prizes and transformed our world, it did not liberate her from the prejudices of either the male-dominated scientific community or society.In Obsessive Genius, the author and historian Barbara Goldsmith has discovered the woman behind the icon we have come to believe in - an all-too-human woman trying to balance a scientific career with the obligations of family, the prejudice of society, the constant search for adequate funding, and the battle for recognition.Using original research (diaries, letters, and family interviews) to peel away the layers of myth, Goldsmith offers a portrait of Marie Curie, her amazing discoveries, and the immense price she paid for fame.",

But when Eliza sweeps her school and district spelling bees in quick succession, Saul takes it as a sign that she is destined for greatness.  In this altered reality, Saul inducts her into his hallowed study and lavishes upon her the attention previously reserved for Aaron, who in his displacement embarks upon a lone quest for spiritual fulfillment.  When Miriam's secret life triggers a familial explosion, it is Eliza who must order the chaos.Myla Goldberg's keen eye for detail brings Eliza's journey to three-dimensional life. As she rises from classroom obscurity to the blinding lights and outsized expectations of the National Bee, Eliza's small pains and large joys are finely wrought and deeply felt.Not merely a coming-of-age story, Goldberg's first novel delicately examines the unraveling fabric of one family.  The outcome of this tale is as startling and unconventional as her prose, which wields its metaphors sharply and rings with maturity.  The work of a lyrical and gifted storyteller, Bee Season marks the arrival of an extraordinarily talented new writer.",

        "Authors": "By Carlson, Richard (EDT) and Shield, Benjamin (EDT)",
        "Description": "In thirty-seven original essays written for this book, some of the world's leaders in healing explore their personal and professional experiences in order to uncover the underlying principles on which all healing rests.  Rather than focusing on diverse techniques, the writers seek the \"golden thread\" that ties together the wide range of approaches to healing.In simple, direct language, the contributors explore the complex nature of healing from many viewpoints.  We hear from physicians, psychologists, nurses, metaphysical healers, and shamans.Their topics include:what healing really is and how it takes placethe power of the healer withinwhat to look for in a healerthe function of spirituality in healingthe dramatic effects of the healing relationshipthe role of attitudes and emotionslove as a healing forcehealing and deathThe result is a grand synthesis of heartfelt thinking that offers a treasury of profound insights for people in the healing professions, people who seek to develop their own healing capacities, people who wish to benefit from healers, and anyone interested in the magical properties of human relationships.",

People want to learn about religions because they know that religions have great answers to the big questions.Award-winning authors Rabbi Marc Gellman and Monsignor Thomas Hartman have produced a unique way of looking at the world's religions. Instead of isolating each religion in its own separate chapter, this book unites the religions by showing how each of them answers these universal questions:How should we live?What happens to us after we die?Why does bad stuff happen to good folks?How can we talk to God?With a refreshing combination of humor and sensitivity, a rabbi and priest show us how Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and the other great religions teach us to live. This wise and often thoughtprovoking book shows us that each religion has its own wisdom and its own wonderful stories. It also explains who works for God, why the world's religions are so different, and why some days of the year have become holy.How Do You Spell God? helps us appreciate religions from all over the world. It will also help us better understand our planet, our families, and ourselves.",

        "Description": "Why do some companies create sustained, superior profits year after year? Why are they always far ahead of competitors in discovering the ever-changing profit zones of their industry? Why do others languish as their traditional way of doing business turns into a no-profit zone? The Profit Zone provides the answers. It is an original and practical explanation of how and why high profit happens, revealing the strategies of twelve of today's great success stories--a group of companies and executives that have created over $700 billion in market value for their shareholders. More importantly, it shows the lessons that can be learned from the business design of these companies--adaptations that enabled them to always be several steps ahead of competitors in meeting customer priorities. Some examples:The profit lessons any product company can learn from Jack Welch's \"sell solution, not just the box\" business design at GE.How Nicholas Hayek's creation of low-end, profitable firewall brand--the Swatch--protects the rich profitability of the high-end products at his companyHow Roberto Goizueta's decision that the consumer was not the only important customer created the basis for Coke's triumph's over Pepsi.Why Charles Schwab's switchboard business design created a new way of doing business for millions of new customers in financial services.How managers of small and mid-size businesses such as Madden Communications and middle managers in large companies have used Slywotzky and Morrison's ideas to move their companies to the profit zone.",
