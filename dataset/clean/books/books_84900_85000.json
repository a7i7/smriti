And she's learned it all from her favorite book: Lord Thistlebottom's Book of Pitfalls and How to Survive Them. But there's one situation Roxie doesn't know how to handle and that's dealing with Helvetia's Hooligans, the meanest band of bullies in school.   Then Roxie and the hooligans are stranded together on a desert island, the hideout of a couple of criminals on the lam. Can five kids, armed with only a load of survival tactics and a little bit of teamwork, vanquish the villains and find their way home?   &#149; Do not panic. Dig a hole around yourself and spit. The saliva will fall downward, telling you which direction is up.",

        "Description": "In The Caper of the Crown Jewels, Jack is summoned to solve a matter of grave national importance: the theft of the Crown Jewels of the British Empire from the Tower of London. Arriving on the scene, he is greeted by a traditional Tower guard- a Yeoman Warder (or Beefeater)- who explains what's missing: The Imperial State Crown, the Sovereign's Orb, and the Sovereign's Scepter with the cross containing the finest-cut diamond in the world, the Star of Africa. Jack identifies Ivan the Incredible and his assistant, Jazz, as the thieves immediately--but puzzling out how they did it is stickier. The famous Tower has the most advanced security in the world, and even using his impressive gadgets (the Encryption notebook, Heli-Spacer, Rock Corer, and Rope Tornado) Jack is flummoxed by how the jewels were spirited out. However, Jack can conjure up more than gadgets--he foils the evil magicians with some powerful mojo of his own, dispels an invisibility enchantment, and narrowly avoids the executioner's block before restoring the jewels to the crown and earning the gratitude of the Queen herself!",

        "Title": "The Ecological Risks of Engineered Crops (The MIT Press)",
        "Authors": "By Mellon, Margaret and Rissler, Jane",
        "Description": "What will it mean to have a steady stream of animal and microbial genes entering the gene pools of plants in wild ecosystems? Private companies and the federal government are pouring significant resources into biotechnology, and the major application of genetic engineering to agriculture is transgenic crops. This carefully reasoned science and policy assessment shows that the commercialization and release of transgenic crops on millions of acres of farmland can pose serious\u2014and costly\u2014environmental risks. The authors propose a practical, feasible method of conducting precommercialization evaluations that will balance the needs of ecological safety with those of agriculture and business, and that will assist governments seeking to identify and protect against two of the most significant risks. Rissler and Mellon first define transgenic plants and review research currently under way in the field of crop biotechnology. They then identify and categorize the environmental risks presented by commercial uses of transgenic crops. These include the potential of transgenic crops to become weeds or to produce weeds with transgene properties such as herbicide resistance that may require costly control programs. Plants engineered to contain virus particles may facilitate the creation of new viruses that can affect economically important crops. Looking at global seed trade, the authors discuss the relationship between commercial approval in the United States and environmental risks abroad. Of particular concern is the flow of novel genes into the centers of crop biodiversity, primarily in the developing world, that could threaten the genetic base of the world's future food supply. The authors conclude by reviewing the current status of U.S. regulations governing transgenic crops. They discuss the difficulties that this new terrain presents to regulators, and offer recommendations concerning the commercial development, risk assessment, and regulation of these crops.

The courtyard and walls are decorated with beautiful paintings and clay animals, all made by Gugu herself. Best of all, when Kukamba visits, she gets to help shape and paint some of the wonderful zebras, elephants, and birds that Gugu is always adding to the house. When the heavy rains come and her grandmother's showpieces are destroyed, Kukamba is crushed. But the Gugu helps her see that an ending can also be a beginning, and art is not the only beauty the world has to offer. Set in the grassy plains of Zimbabwe and gracefully illustrated in watercolors, GUGU'S HOUSE is a unique tribute to the spirit of creativity and the immutable cycles of nature.",

Thirty years later, a postgraduate of the University of the Wilderness, and for a decade past a national hero, he was persuaded to dictate to a literate friend his own story of his life to date.The account\u2014as modest and undemonstrative as Carson's feats were remarkable\u2014covers his life as a trapper, Indian fighter, guide, and buffalo hunter up to the fall of 1856. Among the high spots during these years were his trapping expedition to California with Ewing Young (1829\u20131831), his celebrated duel with Shunar at the Green River rendezvous of 1837, the three expeditions with John C. Fr\u00e9mont (1842, 1843\u20131844, 1845), his exploits in the Mexican War (l846\u20131848), and his service as an Indian agent.",

In the middle of her final exams, she receives tragic news that her husband, who is also head of the microbiology department, has committed suicide while on sabbatical at a super-secret bio-weapons program in Fort Detrick, Maryland. Known by insiders as \"The Devil's Workshop,\" the program is run by the fierce Admiral James G. Zoll.Meanwhile, hobos Lucky Cunningham and Hollywood Mike are passing through Vanishing Lake, Texas, where, unbeknownst to them, Admiral Zoll is using the nearby prison as a testing ground for the latest bio-weapons capable of targeting specific ethnic groups from the inside--through the victim's DNA. As a bio-accident turns Vanishing Lake into a living hell and threatens to land the bio-weapons into the hands of a band of white supremacists, The Devil's Workshop unfolds via a uniquely entertaining narrative triumvirate: Stacy, Lucky, and Hollywood Mike's tinseltown mogul father, Buddy Brazil. Combining classic elements of science gone awry with a cast of characters that firmly fuses America's dust bowl past with its sensational present, The Devil's Workshop is a thrilling race against a racially charged doomsday.",

        "Authors": "By Thibault, Jane Marie",
        "Description": "\u201cMay you live to be 120!\u201d This old Jewish birthday blessing leads to a question Jane Marie Thibault regularly asks attendees at her workshops and retreats: Would you accept the gift of 120 years with joy and gratefulness, or would your response depend on your circumstances?As Thibault is now an older adult herself and has been working with older adults as a clinical gerontologist for nearly 30 years, she has been confronted by the challenge many older adults face in relating to the message of the Gospel in this later season of life. The material for 10 Gospel Promises for Later Life emerged as Thibault began to explore questions spawned by this blessing and compiled a list of ten challenges aging presents and the fears that accompany these challenges: fear of being left alone at the end of life, fear of not being good enough to go to heaven, fear of being a burden to others, fear that there\u2019s nothing to live for now that the best years are over, difficulty believing in an afterlife, regretting missed opportunities to use talents, fear that it\u2019s too late to fix relationships, feeling unneeded, wishing life had been different, and fear of extended suffering. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thibault then took these fears to the Gospel in a spirit of prayer and meditation. As she read she asked whether the Gospel speaks to the fears of aging, whether there is any good news in the \u201cGood News\u201d for older adults, and whether aging as a Christian is different from aging in secular society. The message she found is that Jesus offers the promise of abundant life to the older adult. Some of the Gospel promises that emerged were: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are the beloved children of God the good parent.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have a mission and purpose that is lifelong.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As spiritual siblings, we are interdependent upon each other for mutual care and assistance.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Powerlessness is powerful.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All that is, is gift, and God will continue to provide for us.\u00a0 \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Forgiveness is offered to us, but it must be shared.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suffering can have meaning for ourselves and others.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Renewal is necessary for life; it is never too late to grow in wisdom and grace.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Death is not the end of life.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will never be left alone; Christ is with us always.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In each chapter Thibault addresses a particular fear, giving an example of how it has affected the daily life of a person in a negative way. She then presents a response, a promise of the Gospel. After examining the promise and discussing how it provides a message of hope in later life, she provides questions for personal reflection and group discussion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10 Gospel Promises for Later Life is an excellent resource for older and middle-aged adults and for those who care for them.

        "Description": "In the years following his and Francis Crick\u2019s towering discovery of DNA, James Watson was obsessed with finding two things: RNA and a wife. Genes, Girls, and Gamow is the marvelous chronicle of those pursuits. Watson effortlessly glides between his heartbreaking and sometimes hilarious debacles in the field of love and his heady inquiries in the field of science. He also reflects with touching candor on some of science\u2019s other titans, from fellow Nobelists Linus Pauling and the incorrigible Richard Feynman to Russian physicist George Gamow, who loved whiskey, limericks, and card tricks as much as he did molecules and genes. What emerges is a refreshingly human portrait of a group of geniuses and a candid, often surprising account of how science is done.",
