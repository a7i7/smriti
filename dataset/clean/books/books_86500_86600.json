        "Description": "At a crossroads in her life, Lucy Jarrett returns home to upstate New York from Japan, only to find herself haunted by her father's unresolved death a decade ago. Old longings stirred up by Keegan Fall, a local glass artist who was once her passionate first love, lead her into the unexpected. Late one night, as she paces the hallways of her family's rambling lakeside house, she discovers, locked in a window seat, a collection of objects that first appear to be idle curiosities, but soon reveal a hidden family history. As Lucy explores these traces of her lineage---from an heirloom blanket and dusty political tracts to a web of allusions depicted in stained-glass windows, both in her hometown and beyond---a new family narrative emerges. It will link her to a unique slice of the suffragette movement, and yield dramatic insights that will free her to live her life to its fullest and deepest.With revelations as captivating as the deceptions at the heart of her best-selling phenomenon, The Memory Keeper's Daughter. Kim Edwards now gives us a powerful family story and a story of love lost and found. The Lake of Dreams is an arresting novel in which every vibrant detail is as carefully placed as a puzzle. With her signature gifts for lyricism, Suspense, and masterly storytelling, Kim Edwards's new novel will delight those who loved The Memory Keeper's Daughter and mesmerize millions of new fans.",

So when the family's heir, Ro Curtlee, was convicted of rape and murder a decade ago, the fallout for those   who helped to bring him to justice was swift and uncompromising.

        "Title": "The Longest War: The Enduring Conflict between America and Al-Qaeda",
        "Authors": "By Bergen, Peter L.",
        "Description": "TEN YEARS HAVE PASSED since the shocking attacks on the World Trade Center, and after seven years of conflict, the last U.S. combat troops left Iraq\u2014only to move into Afghanistan, where the ten-year-old fight continues: the war on terror rages with no clear end in sight. In The Longest War Peter Bergen offers a comprehensive history of this war and its evolution, from the strategies devised in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to the fighting in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and beyond. Unlike any other book on this subject, here Bergen tells the story of this shifting war\u2019s failures and successes from the perspectives of both the United States and al-Qaeda and its allies. He goes into the homes of al-Qaeda members, rooting into the source of their devotion to terrorist causes, and spends time in the offices of the major players shaping the U.S. strategic efforts in the region. At a time when many are frustrated or fatigued with what has become an enduring multigenerational conflict, this book will provide an illuminating narrative that not only traces the arc of the fight but projects its likely future. Weaving together internal documents from al-Qaeda and the U.S. offices of counterterrorism, first-person interviews with top-level jihadists and senior Washington officials, along with his own experiences on the ground in the Middle East, Bergen balances the accounts of each side, revealing how al-Qaeda has evolved since 9/11 and the specific ways the U.S. government has responded in the ongoing fight. Bergen also uncovers the strategic errors committed on both sides\u2014the way that al-Qaeda\u2019s bold attack on the United States on 9/11 actually undermined its objective and caused the collapse of the Taliban and the destruction of the organization\u2019s safe haven in Afghanistan, and how al-Qaeda is actually losing the war of ideas in the Muslim world. The book also shows how the United States undermined its moral position in this war with its actions at Guant\u00e1namo and coercive interrogations\u2014including the extraordinary rendition of Abu Omar, who was kidnapped by the CIA in Milan in 2003 and was tortured for four years in Egyptian prisons; his case represents the first and only time that CIA officials have been charged and convicted of the crime of kidnapping. In examining other strategic blunders the United States has committed, Bergen offers a scathing critique of the Clinton and Bush administrations\u2019 inability to accurately assess and counter the al-Qaeda threat, Bush\u2019s deeply misguided reasons for invading Iraq\u2014including the story of how the invasion was launched based, in part, on the views of an obscure academic who put forth theories about Iraq\u2019s involvement with al-Qaeda\u2014and the Obama administration\u2019s efforts in Afghanistan. At a critical moment in world history The Longest War provides the definitive account of the ongoing battle against terror.",

The Judas Gate is just as timely---and just as surprising.A disturbing audiotape has made its way to General Charles Ferguson, adviser to the Prime Minister, and from him to the President of the United States: battlefield chatter from an ambush in Helmand province, Afghanistan, in which twelve U.S. Army Rangers and a British medical team died. Most of the Taliban voices are Afghan, but not all of them---shockingly, some of them are British, and one in particular, the voice of the commander, bears an Irish accent.The idea that one of their own could be responsible for such a massacre is appalling, and Ferguson immediately puts Sean Dillon in charge of hunting the traitor down. But Dillon has his own way of doing things and, he will eventually discover, so does his quarry. Not only will Dillon be going to war---the war will be coming to him.Filled with suspense, driven by characters of complexity and passion, The Judas Gate is an unforgettable novel by the man \"who has produced some of the best suspense fiction of the past fifty years\" (The San Diego Union-Tribune).Since The Eagle has Landed---one of the biggest-selling thrillers of all time---every novel JACK HIGGINS has written, including his most recent works, The Wolf at the Door and A Darker Place, has become an international bestseller. He has had simultaneous number-one bestsellers in hardcovery and paperback, and many of his books have been made into successful movies, including The Eagle has Landed, To Catch a King, On Dangerous Ground, Eye of the Storm, and Thunder Point.Higgins, who lived in Belfast until he was twelve, had several close calls with bombs and gunfire at an early age. After leaving school at fifteen, he served three years with the Royal Horse Guards in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. Subsequently, he was a circus roustabout, a factory worker, a truck driver, and a laborer, before entering college at age twenty-seven. He has degrees in sociology, social psychology, and economics from the University of London, and a doctorate in media from Leeds Metropolitan University.A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and an expert scuba diver and marksman, Higgins lives on Jersey in the Channel Islands.",

For web-connected readers, it features more than 500 links to never-before-available original documents from Donald Rumsfeld's extensive personal archive. It includes State Department cables, correspondence, and memoranda on topics such as Vietnam, Watergate, the days following 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and much more. Available in ePub and Adobe Reader.Like Donald Rumsfeld, Known and Unknown pulls no punches.  With the same directness that defined his career in public service, Rumsfeld's memoir is filled with previously undisclosed details and insights about the Bush administration, 9/11, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  It also features Rumsfeld's unique and often surprising observations on eight decades of history: his experiences growing up during the Depression and World War II, his time as a Naval aviator; his service in Congress starting at age 30; his cabinet level positions in the Nixon and Ford White Houses; his assignments in the Reagan administration; and his years as a successful business executive in the private sector.  Rumsfeld addresses the challenges and controversies of his illustrious career, from the unseating of the entrenched House Republican leader in 1965, to helping the Ford administration steer the country away from Watergate and Vietnam, to bruising battles over transforming the military for the 21st century, to the war in Iraq, to confronting abuse at Abu Ghraib and allegations of torture at Guantanamo Bay.  Along the way, he offers his plainspoken, first-hand views and often humorous and surprising anecdotes about some of the world's best known figures, from Margaret Thatcher to Saddam Hussein, from Henry Kissinger to Colin Powell, from Elvis Presley to Dick Cheney, and each American president from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George W. Bush.  Rumsfeld relies not only on his memory but also on previously unreleased and recently declassified documents.  Thousands of pages of documents not yet seen by the public will be made available on an accompanying website.  Known and Unknown delivers both a fascinating narrative for today's readers and an unprecedented resource for tomorrow's historians.  Proceeds from the sales of Known and Unknown will go to the veterans charities supported by the Rumsfeld Foundation.",

But Cay\u2019s adventurous spirit, fostered by growing up with her three brothers, is piqued while visiting her godfather in South Carolina.

        "Description": "After a bestselling and acclaimed diversion into fiction, Chuck Klosterman, author of Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs, returns to the form in which he\u2019s been spectacularly successful with a collection of essays about our consumption of pop culture and sports.Q: What is this book about?  A: Well, that\u2019s difficult to say. I haven\u2019t read it yet\u2014I\u2019ve just picked it up and casually glanced at the back cover. There clearly isn\u2019t a plot. I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s a lot of stuff about time travel in this book, and quite a bit about violence and Garth Brooks and why Germans don\u2019t laugh when they\u2019re inside grocery stores. Ralph Nader and Ralph Sampson play significant roles. I think there are several pages about Rear Window and college football and Mad Men and why Rivers Cuomo prefers having sex with Asian women. Supposedly there\u2019s a chapter outlining all the things the Unabomber was right about, but perhaps I\u2019m misinformed.  Q: Is there a larger theme?  A: Oh, something about reality. \u201cWhat is reality,\u201d maybe? No, that\u2019s not it. Not exactly. I get the sense that most of the core questions dwell on the way media perception constructs a fake reality that ends up becoming more meaningful than whatever actually happened. Also, Lady Gaga.  Q: Should I read this book?  A: Probably. Do you see a clear relationship between the Branch Davidian disaster and the recording of Nirvana\u2019s In Utero? Does Barack Obama make you want to drink Pepsi? Does ABBA remind you of AC/DC? If so, you probably don\u2019t need to read this book. You probably wrote this book. But I suspect everybody else will totally love it, except for the ones who totally hate it.",

        "Title": "The Price of Everything: Solving the Mystery of Why We Pay What We Do",
        "Authors": "By Porter, Eduardo",
        "Description": "Everything has a price, but it isn't always obvious what that price is.  Many of the prices we   pay seem to make little sense. We shell out $2.29 for a coffee at Starbucks when a nearly identical brew can be had   at the corner deli for less than a dollar. We may be less willing to give blood for $25 than to donate it for free.   Americans hire cheap illegal immigrants to fix the roof or mow the lawn, and vote for politicians who promise to   spend billions to keep them out of the country. And citizens of the industrialized West pay hundreds of dollars a year   in taxes or cash for someone to cart away trash that would be a valuable commodity in poorer parts of the world.    The Price of Everything starts with a simple premise: there is a price behind each choice that we   make, whether we're deciding to have a baby, drive a car, or buy a book. We often fail to appreciate just how critical   prices are as a motivating force shaping our lives. But their power becomes clear when distorted prices steer our   decisions the wrong way. Eduardo Porter uncovers the true story behind the prices we pay and reveals   what those prices are actually telling us. He takes us on a global economic adventure, from comparing the relative   price of a vote in corrupt S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and in the ostensibly uncorrupt United States, to assessing the cost of happiness   in Bhutan, to deducing the dollar value we assign to human life. His unique approach helps explain: * Why   polygamous societies actually place a higher value on women than monogamous ones. * Why someone may find   more value in a $14 million license plate than the standard issue, $95 one. * Why some government agencies believe   one year of life for a senior citizen is four times more valuable than that of a younger person. Porter   weaves together the constant-and often unconscious-cost and value assessments we all make every day. While   exploring the fascinating story behind the price of everything from marriage and death to mattresses and   horsemeat, Porter draws unexpected connections that bridge a wide range of disciplines and cultures. The result is a   cogent and insightful narrative about how the world really works.    Watch a Video",

Set on the coast of Maine over the course of four summers, Red Hook Road tells the story of two families, the Tetherlys and the Copakens, and of the ways in which their lives are unraveled and stitched together by misfortune, by good intentions and failure, and by love and calamity. A marriage collapses under the strain of a daughter\u2019s death; two bereaved siblings find comfort in one another; and an adopted young girl breathes new life into her family with her prodigious talent for the violin. As she writes with obvious affection for these unforgettable characters, Ayelet Waldman skillfully interweaves life\u2019s finer pleasures\u2014music and literature\u2014with the more mundane joys of living. Within these resonant pages, a vase filled with wildflowers or a cold beer on a hot summer day serve as constant reminders that it\u2019s often the little things that make life so precious.",

        "Description": "\"There are cynics who say that a party platform is something that no one bothers to read and it doesn't very often amount to much.  Whether it is different this time than it has ever been before, I believe the Republican Party has a platform that is a banner of bold, unmistakable colors, with no pastel shades.\" \u2013Ronald Reagan, 1976 Republican National Convention When Ronald Reagan was called to the podium by President Ford during the 1976 Republican National Convention, he had no prepared remarks. But the unrehearsed speech he gave that night is still regarded as one of the most moving speeches of his political career. The reason he was able to give such a powerful speech on a moment's notice was that he was proclaiming the core principles of his heart and soul, which he had been teaching and preaching for years.The New Reagan Revolution reveals new insights into the life, thoughts, and actions of the man who changed the world during the 1980s. The challenges and threats we face today are eerily similar to the conditions in the world before the beginning of the Reagan era. The good news is that we already know what works. Ronald Reagan has given us the blueprint. This book is not merely a diagnosis of our nation's ills, but a prescription to heal our nation, rooted in the words and principles of Ronald Reagan. In these pages, you'll find a plan for returning America to its former greatness, soundness, and prosperity. It's the plan Ronald Reagan developed over years of study, observation, and reflection. It's a plan he announced to the nation, straight from his heart, one summer evening during America's 200th year. It's the plan he put into action during his eight years in office as the most effective president of the 20th century, and it is the plan we can use today to help return America to its former greatness, soundness, and prosperity.",

How do I fix that?\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t give you a lecture on flash ratios, or start a discussion on flash synchronization and rear curtain sync. I\u2019d just say \u201cLower your shutter speed to 1/60 of a second. That should do it\u201d Well, that\u2019s what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets I\u2019ve learned just like I would with a friend\u2014without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.\u201d Each page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better.

        "Description": "Ten years ago, Claire Dederer threw out her back while breastfeeding her baby daughter. Told to try yoga by everyone from the woman behind the counter at the co-op to the homeless guy on the corner, she overcame her doubts and signed up for her first class. And she fell madly in love.Over the next decade, Dederer would tackle poses such as lotus, wheel, and the dreaded crow. She became fast friends with some of them, while others provoked long-standing feuds.It wasn't just her back that was demanding Dederer do something differently. On the surface, life at home looked pretty idyllic. But she found herself thinking more and more about the forces that had shaped her generation. They were children of the 1970s---their mothers had run away to find them-selves and hadn't been afraid to make a few messes along the way. The daughters, as a result, grew up determined to be good, good, good. They would buy organic, create an enriching home environment, and make their own baby food---even if it meant feeling hemmed in by an anxiously conscientious little world. Yoga seemed to fit right into this program.To her surprise, Dederer found that the poses weren't just acrobatic feats (though they were that, too). The deeper she explored them, the more they tested her most basic ideas of what makes a good mother, daughter, friend, wife. Suddenly, headstand was a way to wrestle with anxieties she had always dodged, jump-through helped her understand her mother's flight (and, maybe, her own pursuit of freedom), and the dreaded crow reminded her that losing one's balance could be worth a great deal more than keeping both feet on the ground.As Dederer's practice deepened, the poses that once seemed so daunting now pushed her toward a life that was a little more improvisational---and a little less tidy. Witty and heartfelt, sharp and irreverent, Poser is the story of Dederer's discovery that what she needed most of all was less goodness---and more joy.",

        "Title": "The Quiet World: Saving Alaska's Wilderness Kingdom, 1879-1960",
        "Authors": "By Brinkley, Douglas",
        "Description": "In what is clearly a labor of love, Brinkley (history, Rice U.) recounts an environmentalist's history of Alaska from its purchase by the US in 1880 to the formation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 1960. He charts the wilderness movement through the lives of advocates ranging from itinerant artists and lady bush pilots, to ardent wildlife biologists, to a Supreme Court justice and the President of the United States. Using these biographies as mileposts, he chronicles such conservation achievements as the Glacier Bay and Denali National Parks, Gates of the Arctic National Wildlife Preserve, and the Tongass and Chugach National Forests. Brinkley sketches a portrait of stunning locales and abundant wildlife; industry; politics; unremitting progress; and a surprisingly diverse cast of champions, including John Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, Ansel Adams, Rachel Carson, Allen Ginsberg, and even the Walt Disney Studios.

        "Authors": "By Kelly, Erin",
        "Description": "From an incredible new voice in psychological suspense, a novel about the secrets that remain after a final bohemian summer of excess turns deadly.  This taut psychological thriller begins when Karen and her nine-year- old daughter, Alice, pick up Rex from a ten-year stint in prison for murder. Flash back to the sultry summer in 1990s London when Karen, a straight-A student on the verge of college graduation, first meets the exotic, flamboyant Biba and joins her louche life in a crumbling mansion in Highgate. She begins a relationship with Biba's enigmatic and protective older brother, Rex, and falls into a blissful rhythm of sex, alcohol, and endless summer nights. Na\u00efvely, Karen assumes her newfound happiness will last forever. But Biba and Rex have a complicated family history-one of abandonment, suicide, and crippling guilt-and Karen's summer of freedom is about to end in blood. When old ghosts come back to destroy the life it has taken Karen a decade to build, she has everything to lose. She will do whatever it takes to protect her family and keep her secret. Alternating between the fragile present and the lingering past with a shocker of an ending, The Poison Tree is a brilliant suspense debut that will appeal to readers of Kate Atkinson, Donna Tartt, and Tana French.",

Lampooned by the Left and Lionized by the far Right, his bluster-and-tears brand of political commentary has commandeered attention on both sides of the aisle.Glenn Beck has emerged over the last decade as a unique and bizarre conservative icon for the new century. He encourages his listeners to embrace a cynical paranoia that slides easily into a fantasyland filled with enemies that do not exist and solutions that are incoherent, at best. Since the election of President Barack Obama, Beck\u2019s bombastic, conspiratorial, and often viciously personal approach to political combat has made him one of the most controversial figures in the history of American broadcasting.In Common Nonsense, investigative reporter Alexander Zaitchik explores Beck's strange brew of ratings lust, boundless ego, conspiratorial hard-right politics, and gimmicky morning-radio entertainment chops.Separates the facts from the fiction, following Beck from his troubled childhood to his recent rise to the top of the conservative media heap Zaitchik's recent three-part series in Salon caused so much buzz, Beck felt the need to attack it on his show Based on Zaitchik's interviews with former Beck coworkers and review of countless Beck writings and television and radio shows Explains why Beck is always crying, why he has so many conservative enemies, why he's driven by conspiracy theories, and why he's dangerous to the health of the republicA contributing writer to Alternet, Zaitchik's reporting has appeared in the New Republic, the Nation, Salon, Wired, Reason, and the BelieverBeck, a perverse and high-impact media spectacle, has emerged as a leader in a conservative protest movement that raises troubling questions about the future of American politics.",

        "Description": "An eye-opening and previously untold story, Factory Girls is the first look into the everyday lives of the migrant factory population in China.China has 130 million migrant workers\u2014the largest migration in human history. In Factory Girls, Leslie T. Chang, a former correspondent for the Wall Street Journal in Beijing, tells the story of these workers primarily through the lives of two young women, whom she follows over the course of three years as they attempt to rise from the assembly lines of Dongguan, an industrial city in China\u2019s Pearl River Delta.As she tracks their lives, Chang paints a never-before-seen picture of migrant life\u2014a world where nearly everyone is under thirty; where you can lose your boyfriend and your friends with the loss of a mobile phone; where a few computer or English lessons can catapult you into a completely different social class. Chang takes us inside a sneaker factory so large that it has its own hospital, movie theater, and fire department; to posh karaoke bars that are fronts for prostitution; to makeshift English classes where students shave their heads in monklike devotion and sit day after day in front of machines watching English words flash by; and back to a farming village for the Chinese New Year, revealing the poverty and idleness of rural life that drive young girls to leave home in the first place. Throughout this riveting portrait, Chang also interweaves the story of her own family\u2019s migrations, within China and to the West, providing historical and personal frames of reference for her investigation.A book of global significance that provides new insight into China, Factory Girls demonstrates how the mass movement from rural villages to cities is remaking individual lives and transforming Chinese society, much as immigration to America\u2019s shores remade our own country a century ago.",

In the other, Michel Houellebecq, bestselling author of The Elementary Particles, widely derided as a sex-obsessed racist and misogynist. What began as a secret correspondence between bitter enemies evolved into a remarkable joint personal meditation by France\u2019s premier literary and political live wires.\u00a0 An instant international bestseller, Public Enemies has now been translated into English for all lovers of superb insights, scandalous opinions, and iconoclastic ideas.In wicked, wide-ranging, and freewheeling letters, the two self-described \u201cwhipping boys\u201d debate whether they crave disgrace or secretly have an insane desire to please. L\u00e9vy extols heroism in the face of tyranny; Houellebecq sees himself as one who would \u201cfight little and badly.\u201d L\u00e9vy says \u201clife does not \u2018live\u2019\u201d unless he can write; Houellebecq bemoans work as leaving him in such \u201ca state of nervous exhaustion that it takes several bottles of alcohol to get out.\u201d There are also touching and intimate exchanges on the existence of God and about their own families.Dazzling, delightful, and provocative, Public Enemies is a death match between literary lions, remarkable men who find common ground, confident that, in the end (as L\u00e9vy puts it), \u201cit is we who will come out on top.\u201d",

        "Description": "Something scary is happening to boys today. From kindergarten to college, American boys are, on average, less resilient and less ambitious than they were a mere twenty years ago. The gender gap in college attendance and graduation rates has widened dramatically. While Emily is working hard at school and getting A&#39;s, her brother Justin is goofing off. He&#39;s more concerned about getting to the next level in his videogame than about finishing his homework. Now, Dr. Leonard Sax delves into the scientific literature and draws on more than twenty years of clinical experience to explain why boys and young men are failing in school and disengaged at home. He shows how social, cultural, and biological factors have created an environment that is literally toxic to boys. He also presents practical solutions, sharing strategies which educators have found effective in re-engaging these boys at school, as well as handy tips for parents about everything from homework, to videogames, to medication.",

In this deeply personal and controversial memoir, Father Albert Cuti\u00e9 tells about the devastating struggle between upholding his sacred promises as a priest and falling in love. Already conflicted with growing ideological differences with the Church, Cuti\u00e9 was forced to abruptly change his life the day that he was photographed on the beach, embracing the woman he would later call his wife.Once a poster boy of the Roman Catholic Church-loved and admired by millions-Cuti\u00e9 found that he was not happy and able to live as a celibate priest, especially having to defend the number of positions he was no longer in agreement with. For years he kept his relationship a secret, while he soul searched and prayed for answers. The love that he deemed a blessing was bringing him closer to God, but further from the Church. In Dilemma, Cuti\u00e9 tells about breaking that promise, reigniting the very heated debate over mandatory celibacy for Catholic priests, beginning a new way of life and discovering a new way of serving God.",

Each chapter focuses on one of 11 countries or on the European Union, and four additional countries are available as online chapters or in a custom print solution (Brazil, Canada, Japan, and South Africa). The introduction establishes a comparative structure based on five themes: conflict, democratization, economic liberalization, globalization, and challenges, which are then explored for each country through boxed features that are color-coded for easy cross-reference and comparison. The countries discussed are categorized by economic development, helping students hone their skills of comparison, synthesis, and interpretation by studying countries of similar economic status. With this uniquely effective text, students can gain an understanding of important political trends and concepts, an exposure to politics in a number of countries, and a desire to dig more deeply into the fascinating field of comparative politics.",

Since the dubious \u201cchurch\u201d is in Milt\u2019s county, Laura wants him to look into young Trent and Amanda\u2019s whereabouts.What Milt finds is more than enough to alarm a mother.

Hoping it\u2019s a cow, Milt dares the barbed wire and a suspicious bull, to find instead the body of Amanda. Milt\u2019s investigation is barred at every turn by \u201cBrother Grigsby,\u201d his wife, and their mostly female followers (an amazing number of whom are pregnant).
