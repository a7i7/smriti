Except for moral and political issues that aroused in me a desire to speak out, I have done my utmost throughout my life, for the sake of my children and myself, to remain silent...But now, in my seventieth year, I have decided to tell the story of my life as best I can, so that my children can separate the truth from the myths that others have created about me, as myths are created about everyone swept up in the turbulent and distorting maelstrom of celebrity in our culture.\"To date there have been over a dozen books written about Marlon Brando, and almost all of them have been inaccurate, based on hearsay, sensationalist or prurient in tone. Now, at last, fifty years after his first appearance onstage in New York City, the actor has told his life story, with the help of Robert Lindsey.",

Ursula K. Le Guin sends representatives of the Ekumen into the violent later years of a planetary civil war. Dan Simmons once again billiantly  mixes allegory and space adventure in his dangerous, religion-dominated cosmos of Hyperion. Greg Bear reexplores his artificial universe, \"The Way\", from Eon, Eternity and Legacy.Orson Scott Card recounts the momentous first meeting of his time-and-planet-hopping protagonist Ender Wiggin with Ender's computer based, soon to be companion, Jane.Gregory Benford rockets us back to the Galactic Center, Anne McCaffrey's Ship Who Sang sings again, and Joe Haldeman's Forever War rages on eternally. Here, also, are new stories by David Brin, Nancy Kress, Frederik Pohl, and Robert Silverberg himself--each venturing further into univestigated corners of familiar galaxies to delve into the perilous mystery of being human.Perhaps the greatest concentration of science fiction talent ever in one volume, Far Horizons is an unprecedented masterpiece -- one that reopens vast empires of imagination and adventure to new explorations and appreciations. It is a major SF event, sure to bring unparalleled joy to the hearts of serious fans everywhere.",

Here indeed is a monumental Faust, an audacious man boldly wagering with the devil, Mephistopheles, that no magic, sensuality, experience, or knowledge can lead him to a moment he would wish to last forever. Here, in Faust, Part I, the tremendous versatility of Goethe\u2019s genius creates some of the most beautiful passages in literature. Here too we experience Goethe\u2019s characteristic humor, the excitement and eroticism of the witches\u2019 Walpurgis Night, and the moving emotion of Gretchen\u2019s tragic fate.This authoritative edition, which offers Peter Salm\u2019s wonderfully readable translation as well as the original German on facing pages, brings us Faust in a vital, rhythmic American idiom that carefully preserves the grandeur, integrity, and poetic immediacy of Goethe\u2019s words.",

Someone walks into the bedroom of her Montecito home and takes fourteen-year-old Emma Lancaster away. That is the first crime. A frantic search begins. Eight days later, abduction becomes murder. Police hunt for Emma Lancaster's killer. A year later, they make an arrest.With an outraged town crying out for blood, powerful media tycoon Doug Lancaster vows to see his daughter's accused murderer convicted and put to death. One man stands in his way. He believes that the rush to judgment in itself is a crime. Once a hard-driving, take-no-prisoners Santa Barbara D.A., Luke Garrison sent a defendant to the death chamber - only to discover he was innocent. The last thing he needs is to come back to a place crawling with memories and bad dreams.But there's something strange about the Emma Lancaster case - too many loose ends that don't add up. Although his instincts tell him to leave it alone, Luke is determined to get at the truth. If he plays it right, it could give him back his life. If he's wrong, he could die. And a killer could walk.",

She writes with a keen and amused eye about growing up in an immigrant Jewish family, coming of age in New York in the 1950s, marrying her high school beau, and then arriving at feminist consciousness in the 1970s like so many others of her generation. But unlike many of her contemporaries who left first marriages for independence, Schwartz stayed loyal to her marriage. With refreshing candor Schwartz describes the ongoing challenge of marriage, where success is never without ambivalence and humor. Her essays are wise and warm without being sentimental, and the characters in Schwartz's world are quirky and as charming, well rounded, and complex as those found in any novel.",

While nothing is fail-safe, there are things you can do to halt the downward slide in your family. This book gives dynamic biblical solutions to people who are asking: - Why don't I have passion in my spiritual life? - Is it still possible to restore my marriage? - Can I raise my children to be \"on fire\" for God? - Where do I start? Bruce Wilkinson shows how, in the midst of a society without morals, a passionate relationship with Jesus is possible -- not just a \"mountaintop experience,\" but an everyday vibrant relationship.

        "Description": "Politicians and the media are natural enemies, but in recent times, the relationship has exploded into all-out war. Think about bimbo eruptions, DUI arrests, cocaine parties, National Guard service records, Swift Boat veterans. Think about two generations of Bush presidents up against Dan Rather. Think about who lost. Visit our website for sample chapters! Craig Crawford has seen it all up close and personal, and he is disturbed by what he sees. When politicians turn the public against the media, everyone loses\u2014especially unbiased and courageous news reporting. When veteran White House correspondent Helen Thomas is banished from her front row post, as she has been in the current administration, the American public is denied the chance to consider her pointed questions, even if they go unanswered. Worse, when traditional reporters and media are displaced, the pundits and alternative media take over. Rush, the O'Reilly Factor, Comedy Central's Jon Stewart, and the bloggers have their place in American politics, and the 2004 elections showed the incredible power of the Internet. These media, however, are a different breed, as Crawford points out\u2014they serve a purpose, but at a cost. They become \"opinion merchants,\" bartering outrageous assertions for audience appeal with little attention to the truth. These days, the truth is hard to find. If the press is not believed\u2014or believable\u2014because politicians have turned the public against it, then the press is not free, but under the thumbs of politicians. Without a free press, there is no democracy. That, says Craig Crawford, is where we find ourselves today. If you don't like the news, attack the messenger, and it will go away. Going, going, gone.",

And in Memphis, two white men and a white woman are planning to capitalize on the confrontation between the races by kidnapping the grandson of a wealthy black entrepreneur and pinning the crime on white supremacists. The problem is that Podjo, Rufus, and Reeny have only an amateur's understanding of what a kidnapping entails -- and a total, terrifying incomprehension of their victims.In September September a magisterial historian of the Civil War charts its distant repercussions in the streets of the contemporary South. By turns wryly comic, ribald, and chilling, Shelby Foote's novel is at once a convincing thriller and a powerful tragicomedy of race.September September has been adapted by Larry McMurtry for the Turner Network Television film Memphis, starring Cybill Shepherd.",

A classical pianist, SAT whiz, computer genius, graduate of Annapolis, naval officer, Dream Team Olympics member, philanthropist, community activist, and Christian, he's a true Renaissance athlete. Yet this thirty-year-old husband and father still asks his parents for advice. Wouldn't you like to sit in the Robinsons' living room and learn why David thinks he has the greatest parents on earth?How to Raise an MVP lets you feel like you're at a warm and personal family gathering. Ambrose and Freda Robinson, along with their three children, David, Kimberly, and Chuck, share anecdotes of family life and offer insight into successful parenting. In the Robinson house there were no TV baby-sitters, no back talkers, and no underachievers. But there were three children who knew they were loved and that they had the potential to dream and to do anything they wanted to do.From bringing a baby home for the first time to watching their children leave the nest, Ambrose and Freda tell about raising a family - and the lessons they learned along the way. They talk frankly about the hard times as well as the good times, and discuss specific issues such as honesty, academics, curfews, sibling rivalry, dating and sex, racism, anger, communication, building a career, and more.",

        "Authors": "By Galal, Ahmed (EDT) and Lawrence, Robert Z. (EDT)",
        "Description": "In April 1997, Egyptian President Mubarak and U.S. Vice President Gore agreed to explore the possibility of creating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Egypt and the United States. The very idea of such an agreement has been met by controversy and skepticism from critics in both countries. The authors of this book, however, believe that the case for considering an FTA between the U.S. and Egypt rests on solid economic and political grounds. An agreement could help promote Egyptian economic reform and growth, while providing substantial economic benefits to the U.S. Politically, it could strengthen American ties with an ally who plays a crucial role in helping to achieve peace in the region and in maintaining a stable supply of oil in the Middle East.This book offers U.S. and Egyptian policymakers answers to such pertinent questions as: What form should an FTA agreement take? Should it concentrate on border barriers or cover other aspects such as investments and services? What are the likely implications for both countries? And how will such an agreement affect the rest of the region? Its conclusions will be relevant to policymakers elsewhere in their pursuit of similar regional trade agreements.Copublished with the Egyptian Center for Economic Studies",

I'm not free. I\u2019m engaged--\" \"Oh, Cam, don\u2019t!\" she begged. \"It cannot be. It is too late. There is no way--\" A tremor coursed through her -- a premonition of danger. This was madness, she knew. The two were as much star-crossed lovers as Romeo and Juliet, theirs as forbidden a love by all the same barriers of family, church, and honor. \"There has to be a way. There must be. We'll find a way!\" Cam declared as he drew her into his arms. \"Cam, let me go. We must forget this ever happened.\" \"How can we?\" he asked in anguish.

In fact, the opposite holds true, with management often expecting that more work will be produced in less time. People today are juggling family responsibilities, jobs, and social obligations. In their haste to achieve it all, something is still lacking.In Gracious Living in a New World, Alexandra Stoddard offers her ideas for achieving a gracious lifestyle. Her inspiration stems from the experiences she shared with her husband, Peter, when they moved from New York City to a little cottage in a tiny sea-side Connecticut village.  Alexandra Stoddard's message is positive and practical. It is also relevant to everyone. City-slickers and village dwellers alike will find relief and refuge amongst Alexandra's trademark colorful pages.  But most importantly, readers will find the inspiration to live a gracious life.",

In Breaking the Da Vinci Code: Answers to the Questions Everyone's Asking, Darrell Bock, Ph.D., responds to the novelist's claims using central ancient texts and answers the following questions: Who was Mary Magdalene?Was Jesus Married?Would Jesus Being Single be Un-Jewish?Do the So-Called Secret Gnostic Gospels Help Us Understand Jesus?What Is the Remaining Relevance of The Da Vinci Code?Darrell Bock's research uncovers the origins of these codes by focusing on the 325 years immediately following the birth of Christ, for the claims of The Da Vinci Code rise or fall on the basis of things emerging from this period. Breaking the Da Vinci Code, now available in trade paper, distinguishes fictitious entertainment from historical elements of the Christian faith. For by seeing these differences, one can break the Da Vinci code.",

        "Title": "A Justice for All: William J. Brennan, Jr., and the Decisions That Transformed America",
        "Authors": "By Eisler, Kim Isaac",
        "Description": "Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., was both a radical egalitarian and a prime mover on the United States Supreme Court. From 1956 to 1990 - through the Warren, Burger, and Rehnquist eras - he effected both judicial and social change via decisions on racial desegregation, pornography, the application of the Bill of Rights to the states, privacy, and abortion. Brennan's stamp is on nearly every contemporary American social issue. A Justice for All, the first biography of Justice Brennan, gathers his considerable achievements in the context of his times and his life.Brennan had been the original \"stealth\" nominee to the United States Supreme Court. Having served eight years as a state court judge in New Jersey, Brennan was a total unknown on the national stage when President Eisenhower limited his search for a new justice to a Northeastern Catholic currently serving on a state court. In a rancorous confirmation hearing that foreshadowed events of the eighties and nineties, Brennan tangled with Senator Joseph McCarthy. Taking his place on a Supreme Court bench surrounded by such towering figures as Earl Warren, Felix Frankfurter, Hugo Black, William Douglas, and John Harlan, Brennan observed, \"I felt a little like the mule at the Kentucky Derby.\"But in a career that would span one-third of a century, Brennan proved to be one of the most visionary and influential justices in the history of the Supreme Court. Not content merely to interpret the Constitution, Brennan rewrote American law in the fields of obscenity, criminal rights, affirmative action, and privacy.This account of the life of an extremely private and little-understood man brings the reader face to face with the clash of intellectual forces that created the landmark rulings of the Warren court. In the midst of these colliding giants was an unpresuming lawyer from Newark who took Warren's broad concepts and wrote them into law; who convinced a firebrand like William O. Douglas, that, at times, it paid to compromise; and who willingly braved personal and professional confrontations with his former Harvard University law professor, Felix Frankfurter.In his three years of research, author Kim Isaac Eisler utilized the private papers of Justices Brennan, Douglas, Harlan, Warren, and Black, among others; interviewed dozens of former Brennan clerks; and found childhood friends and onetime law partners to reveal what lit the fire inside this history-making judicial activist.A Justice for All is the remarkable tale of a man who operated within the marble walls of the Supreme Court with the consummate skills of a dealmaker, creating majorities, writing laws, and all the while steering clear of political fire. In so doing, he succeeded in changing American law and society.",
