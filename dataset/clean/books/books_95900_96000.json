Dr. Mike Flynn's single mom taught him early how to cook and clean, and there's nothing like vacuuming or doing dishes to help a guy relax. Annabelle Ronaldi is an artist without a domestic bone in her body. Since her fiance's death, she can't paint, and life looks hopeless. Until the day after her sister's wedding, when she wakes up with Mike next to her in bed, and then she's really beside herself - because the handsome stranger is a dead ringer for her dead fiance. After their mind-blowing one night stand, Mike is sure this is the woman he wants to take care of forever, but she acts like she's seen a ghost. While Mike sets to work wooing Annabelle, she sets to work sniffing out the truth of the convoluted family secret that turns everybody's lives upside down.

        "Description": "Michele Bachmann is one of the most compelling leaders in America.  But despite all the magazine covers and cable television stories, most  people don't know who she really is, where she comes from, or what she  believes. So she decided to tell her own story and let the reader decide.As you'll learn in this fascinating memoir, Bachmann wasn't the type  of kid who started dreaming about the White House in elementary school.  She grew up in Iowa and Minnesota as a typical midwestern girl, grounded  by her family and her faith. She was raised to believe in the American  dream: that anyone could succeed if they worked hard and took advantage  of this country's boundless opportunities.She followed her dreams to college and law school, pursued a career as  a federal tax attorney, started a successful business with her loving  husband, raised five great kids and (over time) twenty-three foster  children. By her early forties she was very happy as a full-time mom and  homemaker and was a leading education reform advocate in Minnesota.Then she became what she calls \"an accidental politician.\"The political insiders who ran Minnesota held a one-party line-Al  Franken-style liberalism. Bachmann became especially concerned about a  state-mandated education curriculum that stressed political correctness  over academic excellence. She started making calls, writing letters, and  recruiting others to act. When her state senator (an entrenched insider)  refused to listen, someone had to challenge him for his seat. No one else  volunteered, so Bachmann jumped in-and won.That was the start of an amazing journey from obscurity to the state  senate, to the U.S. Congress, to an underdog campaign for president.  Along the way her style has been consistent. She says what she means and  she does it. She is the rare political figure who fights for her beliefs.  She speaks from the heart, with common sense about limited government,  the sanctity of life and marriage, the power of free enterprise, and the  need to confront America's enemies. She also talks about putting  principles above partisanship, even if that means ruffling the feathers  of the Republican elite.As Bachmann puts it, the Republican coalition is traditionally a  \"three-legged stool\"-economic conservatives, social conservatives, and  national security conservatives. Like Ronald Reagan, she represents all  three groups. And in addition, as the founder of the Tea Party caucus in  Congress, Bachmann considers the Tea Party the dynamic fourth leg of the  coalition, in support of a return to constitutional conservatism.This book will show you why Michele Bachmann believes ordinary people  can take on the establishment and win. \"Armed with values and faith,  supported by family and fellow citizens, together we can do much. We can  secure what people are yearning for-the chance to take our country back.  Just watch.\"",

        "Description": "All of Java's Input/Output (I/O) facilities are based on streams,  which provide simple ways to read and write data of different types.  Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its own  application. The universe of streams is divided into four large  categories: input streams and output streams, for reading and writing  binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and writing textual  (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar with the basic  kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a CipherInputStream  for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream for automatically  compressing data? Do you know how to use buffered streams effectively  to make your I/O operations more efficient? Java I/O tells you all  you ever need to know about streams--and probably more.A discussion of I/O wouldn't be complete without treatment of character  sets and formatting. Java supports the UNICODE standard, which provides definitions for the character sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the first programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually  any language. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting  textual and numeric data. Java I/O shows you how to control number  formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but outdated) ASCII  character set, and get a head start on writing truly multilingual software.Java I/O includes:Coverage of all I/O classes and related classesIn-depth coverage of Java's number formatting facilities and its support for International character sets",

Pursuing that vision, C#'s designers succeeded in creating a safe, simple, component-based, high-performance language that works effectively with Microsoft's .NET Framework.  Now the favored language among those programming for the Microsoft platform, C# continues to grow in popularity as more developers discover its strength and flexibility.  And, from the start, C# developers have relied on Programming C# both as an introduction to the language and a means of further building their skills. The fourth edition of Programming C#--the top-selling C# book on the market--has been updated to the C# ISO standard as well as changes to Microsoft's implementation of the language.  It also provides notes and warnings on C# 1.1 and C# 2.0.Aimed at experienced programmers and web developers, Programming C#, 4th Edition, doesn't waste too much time on the basics.  Rather, it focuses on the features and programming patterns unique to the C# language.  New C# 2005 features covered in-depth include:Visual Studio 2005GenericsCollection interfaces and iteratorsAnonymous methodsNew ADO.NET data controlsFundamentals of Object-Oriented ProgrammingAuthor Jesse Liberty, an acclaimed web programming expert and entrepreneur, teaches C# in a way that experienced programmers will appreciate by grounding its applications firmly in the context of Microsoft's .NET platform and the development of desktop and Internet applications.  Liberty also incorporates reader suggestions from previous editions to help create the most consumer-friendly guide possible.",

He could watch as much television as he wanted; his best friend Charlie visited him often enough; and Nurse Ophelia--the prettiest no-nonsense nurse ever--sometimes took him bowling. Of course, that didn't mean he had it easy. His allergies restricted his diet to strawberry smoothies, and being the only kid at the hospital could get lonely. But it never once crossed Zack's mind to leave...until the night someone crashed through the front doors and told him to run. Now he's on a race for answers--about his past, his parents, and his strange sickness--even as every step takes him closer to the darkest of truths.",

If you look to your circumstances alone, it may seem that God has forgotten you. But He hasn\u2019t. He can\u2019t. And He wouldn\u2019t even if He could.

Douglas and, more recently, Christ the Lord by Anne Rice and Stone Tables by Orson Scott Card, The Masada Scroll is bold and reverent, with deep and important meaning for today\u2019s world. \u00a0At the heart of this timely novel is the discovery of a previously unknown gospel that predates the four gospels of the New Testament. The scroll introduces a mysterious symbol that combines the Star of David, the Cross of Christianity and the Crescent and Star of Islam. None of these symbols existed at the time the Gospel was written, adding to the mystery that Michael Flannery, an Irish priest, must unravel. \u00a0Flannery discovers that the symbol represents the Trevia Dei, or Three Paths to God. At the heart of Jesus\u2019 message is the unity of the paths that lead to God. The true meaning of Trevia Dei has become perverted over the centuries, turning the message of unity into a single path to salvation. \u00a0But there are those who do not want the message of this wonderful book of light and love brought to our troubled world, who have chosen to separate rather than unite God\u2019s children.\u00a0The Masada Scroll is the story of the new Apostles who struggle to bring the simple message of Jesus back into a world desperate for joy.\u00a0The Masada Scroll is a tale of the timeless quest for spiritual truth and redemption. It is a story that will change the way you look at the world\u2026and your own heart.",

        "Description": "The Bush administration is out but the American public continues to suffer from its disastrous domestic and foreign policies. In this excellently documented work, presidential scholar Shirley Anne Warshaw offers an in-depth analysis and exploration of the political maneuvering that got us into our current mess. Combining her study of the motivations of both Dick Cheney and George W. Bush, knowledge of the spheres in which they operated, and personal interviews with White House staff and Washington insiders, Warshaw demonstrates that these complementary conservatives were nothing less than co-presidents.  Breaking with popular sentiment, she denies that Bush's authority was hijacked or stolen. Bush, rather, focused on building what he called a moral and civil society, anchored by a war on science and by the proliferation of faith-based programs, while allowing Cheney to lead in business and foreign policy. Warshaw highlights Cheney's decades-long career in Washington and his familiarity with its inner workings to present a complete picture of this calculating political powerhouse who continues to capture headlines. From Cheney's unprecedented merging of the vice president's office into the president's to his abhorrence of what he deemed congressional interference in the president's ability to do his job, Warshaw paints an intriguing, and at times frightening, portrait.",

His is a patriot's passion: his motive is to save the American republic he loves.\"---Jonathan Freedland, The New York Review of Books\"The role of the prophet is an honorable one. In Chalmers Johnson the American empire has found its Jeremiah. He deserves to be heard.\"---Andrew J. Bacevich, The Washington Post Book World\"Chalmers Johnson's important new book is something with which everyone who aspires to a worthwhile opinion about this country's future must contend.\"---Los Angeles Times (On Nemesis)\"Trenchantly argued, comprehensively documented, grimly eloquent Worthy of the republic it seeks to defend.\"---The Boston Globe (On the Sorrows of Empire)\"Stunning and shocking...Blowback is a wake-up call for America.\"---John Dower, Pulitzer Prize-Winning Author of Embracing DefeatIn his prophetic book Blowback, published before 9/11, Chalmers Johnson warned that our secret operations around the globe would exact a price at home. Now, in a brilliant series of essays, Johnson measures that price, assesses the dangers America faces, and shows just how the United States became a superpower living desperately beyond its means. Our reliance on Pentagon economics, a global empire of bases, and war without end is, he declares, nothing short of \"a suicide option.\"Dismantling the Empire explores the subjects for which Johnson is now famous, from the origins of blowback to Barack Obama's Afghanistan conundrum, including our inept spies, our devastatingly bad behavior in other countries, our ill-fought wars, and our capitulation to a military that has taken ever more control of the federal budget. There is, he proposes, only one way out: President Obama must begin to dismantle the empire before the Pentagon dismantles the American dream. If we do not learn from the fates of past empires, he suggests, our decline and fall are foreordained. This is Johnson at his best: delivering both a warning and an urgent prescription for a remedy.",

Flash forward to present-day Jerusalem, where 35-year-old Israeli counterterrorism agent Sam Deker has just thwarted the most recent act of violence\u2014an attempt by radical Palestinians to blow up the Dome of the Rock mosque and pin the blame on right-wing Orthodox Jews. The threat, however, is a diversion. Deker himself is the real target. He is captured and taken to neighboring Jordan, where he is tortured because of his deep knowledge of Israel\u2019s most closely guarded state secret. Deker escapes with his comrade Uri Elezar, making it all the way to the border, only to be taken down at the banks of the Jordan River. This time, however, Deker wakes up in the middle of the ancient Israelite army on the eve of its historic siege of Jericho. Deker doesn\u2019t know if he is dead, in some torture-induced psychosis, or really back in time. But General Bin-Nun has declared a colossal holy war, and he\u2019s sending Deker and Elezar on a dangerous mission to spy on the Promised Land in advance of the invasion. For Deker, it\u2019s his only hope to escape this genocidal hell. Then he finds himself in the arms of a beautiful enemy named Rahab, caught in a web of deadly betrayal, as he struggles to unlock the truth, secure Israel\u2019s future and his own, and save the twenty-first century from The Promised War.",
