As he sets out in pursuit of vengeance, entering the nightmarish Court of the Ruby Grail, increasingly more enchanted (and confused) by his love for the mysterious Ursula, he finds himself facing demonic adversaries, war and political intrigue.Against a backdrop of the wonders--both sacred and profane--and the beauty and ferocity of Renaissance Italy, Anne Rice creates a passionate and tragic legend of doomed young love and lost innocence.",

What is shown taking place on the grassy knoll proves beyond a doubt that a second killer was involved.Then the tape disappears. Enlisting the help of his childhood friend, beautiful Nicki Anderson, Cole plunges into a desperate search for answers about his father, his family, and the secrets that have blackened a nation's soul for over thirty years.The hunter becomes the hunted when operatives of a super-secret agency buried deep in the Defense Department embark on a killing mission sanctioned by Operation Snowfall, a shadowy organization that trades in disinformation and death.But it is only a small part of a much larger conspiracy linked to a powerful family's controlling interests in unions and the illegal drug trade - one that reaches all the way to the President himself. Cole's only hope of survival is to find the tape and get it into the public arena at last ... before the truth about what really happened that long-ago day in Dallas is buried forever.",

        "Title": "The Line of Fire: From Washington to the Gulf, the Politics and Battles of the New Military",
        "Authors": "By Crowe, William J., Jr.",
        "Description": "On September 19, 1992, Admiral William J. Crowe, Jr., made headlines with his endorsement of Democrat Bill Clinton as President of the United States. Washington took sharp notice: Crowe, a staunch advocate of military strength, had served for four years - under both Presidents Reagan and Bush - as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As the top-ranking officer in the American military, he held all of its branches and forces, outposts from the South Pacific to the North Atlantic, from Antarctica to Central America, under the sweep of his command. To this day, many Clinton strategists perceive Crowe's endorsement and his subsequent work for Clinton as one of the campaign's turning points.It was an unexpected move. But Washington, luckily, had learned to expect surprises from the candid, witty Oklahoman whose tenure as commander was marked by an openness to change rarely encountered in the military hierarchy's upper ranks.As his memoir, The Line of Fire, makes clear, quick change has been a constant in Crowe's career - a fast flight up the chain of command that began just after World War II at the height of the Cold War, reaching its apex with the thaw and the beginning of a new era in foreign relations. Few military men's careers provide such a vantage on so many momentous transitions and events: women in the ranks; the new high-tech range of weaponry and machinery; and the rise of a new breed of military leader, men like Crowe himself, trained in the halls of Congress as well as on the battlefield. Crowe shows where the military has been - and where it must go.He takes us into the secret world of the Pentagon, where we see the sophisticated war games staged by the highest officials in the land. He takes us inside the story of the build-up of tensions in the Gulf, explaining what we have never really understood about the accidental shoot-down of an Iranian Airbus by the cruiser Vincennes and about the U.S. raid on Libya (why we never intended to kill Qaddafi; why Caspar Weinberger would never admit that the U.S. did hit the French embassy). Admiral Crowe shows us the most significant military and political events of the last decade as we have never seen them before.Crowe explains why nuclear weapons are our least effective defense; takes a critical look at Desert Storm (an ideal battle situation); speculates on the ending of the Cold War (George Bush was only one of the many contributors); and tells the story of his special friendship with Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergei Akhromeyev (the Soviet chief of staff), who shared many of his concerns about the future of nuclear weapons and U.S.-Soviet relations.As never before, Crowe's memoir explains the world of political maneuvering that lies behind military decision-making. From the battlefield to Capitol Hill, Crowe gives a candid, always interesting look at modern military life - and his concerns for our future.",

Is violence a necessary aspect of the hero? And daring? Why did the cult of the hero flower in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in a way it hadn't for two hundred years? Was the figure of Nelson\u2014intemperate, charming, theatrical, anxious, impetuous, considerate, indifferent to death and danger, inspirational to those around him, and, above all, fixed on attack and victory\u2014an aberration in Enlightenment England? Or was the greatest of all English military heroes simply the product of his time, \"the conjurer of violence\" that England, at some level, deeply needed?It is a story rich with modern resonance. This was a battle fought for the control of a global commercial empire. It was won by the emerging British world power, which was widely condemned on the continent of Europe as \"the arrogant usurper of the freedom of the seas.\" Seize the Fire not only vividly describes the brutal realities of battle but enters the hearts and minds of the men who were there; it is a portrait of a moment, a close and passionately engaged depiction of a frame of mind at a turning point in world history.",

        "Authors": "By Piven, Frances Fox",
        "Description": "The bestselling political thinker analyzes the impact of the Iraq War on domestic policy. The overwhelming attention paid to America's imperial posture overseas has turned our eyes away from a crucial dimension of belligerent foreign policy: the domestic politics of war. Frances Fox Piven, one of the country's most celebrated social scientists, raises questions others have not. She examines the ways the war on terror served to shore up the Bush administration's political base and analyzes the manner in which flag-waving politicians used the emotional fog of war to further their regressive social and economic agendas. In the past, governments tried to reward their citizens for their costly sacrifices in blood and money. During World War II, tax rates on the wealthy rose to 90 percent; toward the end of the Vietnam War, eighteen-year-olds were given the right to vote. In this war, by contrast, democratic rights are being rolled back and taxes on the rich have been slashed. Even veterans' benefits have been sharply reduced. The War at Home makes sense of these developments by putting the current domestic fallout of war in the context of history and by turning an unsentimental eye on the domestic motivations of American militarism.",

        "Description": "Star Jones Reynolds had done it all. College on scholarship, law school on loans, and life by faith. She had achieved a prestigious career as a lawyer and prosecutor, provided much-needed calm and insight while reporting the Rodney King and O. J. Simpson trials on television, and landed a spot cohosting one of America's most popular daytime television shows, The View. Then why was she feeling so down?It all began when Star took a close look at herself and her life and realized she wasn't happy with what she saw: obesity precluded her from crossing her legs, she needed an asthma inhaler, she couldn't fasten her own necklace, and, worst of all, she got too tired to shop -- a disaster because Star Jones Reynolds is a seriously committed shopper.Then she realized something else: with all her extraordinary accomplishments, none of it mattered without true love. Thinking long and hard, she finally understood that she hadn't yet met the man of her dreams because she wasn't ready for him.Star decided to make it happen. She began a personal journey to reconstitute her physical look, emotional state, and already strong spirituality. Even if she didn't find love, it would be a win-win situation because she'd emerge from the experience a healthier, happier woman -- one who could truly shine. Unless you live on another planet, you know Star succeeded in her quest and did find true love -- and it wasn't that hard at all. In Shine, she shares it all in her wise, revealing, irreverent, laugh-out-loud style.Shine is divided into three main sections, each exploring core issues of interest to women. Part One guides women toward being their most attractive physical selves using Star's personal secrets on losing weight and finding hair, fashion, and makeup chic (inexpensively). Part Two asks tough questions about emotional preparedness for a relationship and shows you how to think like lawyers, and how to get your financial and emotional houses in order. Part Three delves into a woman's spiritual life -- discover how to talk to God no matter what your religion. Spiking the book are Star's \"absolutes\" -- truisms that have always worked for her and continue to give her guidance -- quizzes and self-assessment exercises that will help you focus on your particular strengths and weaknesses.Everyone knows Star Jones Reynolds is a success story, a happy, rough-edges-to-emotional-and-financial-riches tale. Until you read this book, you won't know how she got there -- and how you can echo her triumphs and shine.",

        "Title": "Target U.S.A.: The Inside Story of the New Terrorist War",
        "Authors": "By Mizell, Louis R., Jr.",
        "Description": "\"Many Americans still believe that terrorism plagues only other nations, places such as Jerusalem and Beirut, Belfast and London, Tokyo and Paris, Berlin and Bogot\u00e1. Not here, not in the United States, they think. Their perception is dead wrong.\" \u2014from the Introduction  An enemy with a thousand faces has declared war on the United States, and the fighting has already commenced. The battlefields are neither deserts nor tropical jungles, but office buildings, hotels, churches, airports, and even quiet suburban streets. The enemy soldiers, rarely in uniform, are virtually invisible. The war is terrorism and, as the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings have so chillingly shown, it is unlike any other threat the United States has ever encountered. In this riveting frontline report, renowned counterterrorism expert Louis R. Mizell tells the inside story of the escalating terrorist war in America. Drawing on his firsthand experience as an intelligence officer with the U.S. State Department, Mizell details the methods, the motives, and the tactics of extremist groups and individuals while revealing the big picture that most of the media either misses or ignores. Target U. S. A. is a vivid, fast-paced narrative filled with chilling accounts of terrorist acts from around the country. Mizell paints a hardhitting portrait of a once shielded society that is no longer a safe haven. The facts are documented, disturbing, and alarming: Puerto Rican terrorists planted a bomb in a New York tavern, killing five; Sikh terrorists systematically assassinated targets in the Midwest; a team of Libyan terrorists set up a secret training camp in Colorado; and Croatian terrorists committed scores of violent acts that were reported as street crime. Shocking you-are-there accounts expose undercover terrorist actions at universities, hotels, restaurants, and banks, as well as brazen, broad daylight assassination attempts on political leaders. Using professional sources unavailable to most researchers, Mizell provides up-to-date information on established foreign and domestic groups, new emerging operations, and current targets, trends, and tactics in terrorism \u2014information the general public never sees. Particularly provocative is his report on how many unpublicized terrorist operations occur almost daily on American soil, often appearing as routine bank robberies or gun shop burglaries. With special access to interrogation reports, confiscated documents, and other previously untapped confidential materials, Mizell supplies profiles of terrorists \u2014the nationalists, the ideologues, the religious zealots, and the unaffiliated loners \u2014that will change the way you read the news. If it is true that the best defense of democracy is an informed citizenry, Target U. S. A. is urgent, compelling, and essential reading for all Americans. \"Shattering the talking-head world of touchie-feelie pseudoacademics and wannabe counterterrorists, Lou Mizell's ground-level lessons from the real world give us an accurate, frightening look at some of the world's most resourceful, enterprising, and deadly terrorists. Mizell is a warrior who has put his life on the line, and his experience can help teach us how to survive these nasty, nasty times.\" \u2014John Weisman, author of the New York Times bestselling Rogue Warrior series. \"Mizell writes from his own experience, which is the stuff of suspense fiction, except it's all real. We all need to pay attention to what he has to say before it's too late.\"\u2014Mark Olshaker, novelist and coauthor of Mindhunter and Journey into Darkness. \"Effective security depends upon good intelligence. Lou Mizell understands this better than anyone. He has smelled the cordite and walked amidst the shattered glass and shattered lives. Every reader could learn from Lou's experience.\" \u2014Donald E. Moss, Deputy Chief, NYPD, Retired Former Chief of Bronx Detectives. \"Target U. S. A. provides essential knowledge of domestic terrorist activities for all law enforcement personnel. Lou Mizell has provided a spellbinding summary of the current threat to our nation. This book is a must read.\" \u2014Lieutenant Colonel Matt Tyszka, Connecticut State Police.",

        "Authors": "By Conway, Jill Ker",
        "Description": "The acclaimed author of the best-selling The Road from Coorain and True North now gives us the third book in her remarkable continuing memoir\u2014describing the pleasures, the challenges, and the constant surprises (good and bad) of her years as the first woman president of Smith College.The story opens in 1973 as Conway, unbeknownst to her, is first \u201clooked over\u201d as a prospective candidate by members of the Smith community, and continues as she assesses her passions and possibilities and agrees to the new challenge of heading the college in 1975. The jolt of energy she gets from being surrounded by several thousand young women enables her to take on the difficulties that arise in dealing with the diverse Smith constituencies\u2014from the self-appointed protectors of the great male tradition of humanistic learning to the equally determined young feminists insisting on change. We see Conway juggling the needs and concerns of faculty, students, parents, trustees, and alumnae, and re-defining and redesigning aspects of the college to create programs in line with the new realities of women\u2019s lives. We sense the urgency of her efforts to shape an institution that will attract students of the 1990s and beyond.Through it all we see Jill Ker Conway coping with her husband\u2019s illness, and learning to protect and sustain her inner self. As the end of a decade at Smith approaches, we see her realizing that she has both had her education and made her contributions, and that it is time now for her to graduate.",

        "Title": "The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America",
        "Authors": "By Micklethwait, John and Wooldridge, Adrian",
        "Description": "With a unique blend of insight, balance, and wit, two of our most renowned America watchers brilliantly anatomize the conservative movement and explain how it has stamped its program so deeply into American life.  The Right Nation is not \"for\" liberals, and it's not \"for\" conservatives. It's for any of us who want to understand one of the most important forces shaping American life. How did America's government become so much more conservative in just a generation? Compared to Europe-or to America under Richard Nixon-even President Howard Dean would preside over a distinctly more conservative nation in many crucial respects: welfare is gone; the death penalty is deeply rooted; abortion is under siege; regulations are being rolled back; the pillars of New Deal liberalism are turning to sand. Conservative positions have not prevailed everywhere, of course, but this book shows us why they've been so successfully advanced over such a broad front: because the battle has been waged by well-organized, shrewd, and committed troops who to some extent have been lucky in their enemies.  John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, like modern-day Tocquevilles, have the perspective to see this vast subject in the round, unbeholden to forces on either side. They steer The Economist's coverage of the United States and have unrivaled access to resources and-because of the magazine's renown for iconoclasm and analytical rigor-have had open-door access wherever the book's research has led them. And it has led them everywhere: To reckon with the American right, you have to get out there where its centers are and understand the power flow among the brain trusts, the mouthpieces, the organizers, and the foot soldiers. The authors write with wit and skewer whole herds of sacred cows, but they also bring empathy to bear on a subject that sees all too little of it. You won't recognize this America from the far-left's or the far-right's caricatures. Divided into three parts-history, anatomy, and prophecy-The Right Nation comes neither to bury the American conservative movement nor to praise it blindly but to understand it, in all its dimensions, as the most powerful and effective political movement of our age.",

        "Title": "Megatrends Asia: Eight Asian Megatrends That Are Reshaping Our World",
        "Authors": "By Naisbitt, John",
        "Description": "Writing with the combination of acute perceptions and broad sweep of his previous Megatrends bestsellers, Naisbitt describes the dramatic events that are now taking place in Asia as once isolated nation-states expand their individual economies and develop a powerful new synergy that works to their mutual benefit. Although the United States continues to focus on Europe, Naisbitt shows why the collapse of the Soviet Union and the formation of the European Community cannot match in importance the modernization of Asia and the profound impact it will have on American business. Within five years, he writes, Asia's combined gross national product will be double that of Europe and will represent one third of the entire world economy. In the twenty-first century Asia will become both our major competitor and the major consumer of American goods and services.Among the major trends that herald this remarkable transformation are the shift from the primacy of nation-states to business networks, from export-led economies to consumer-driven economies, and from labor-intensive industries to high technology. Add to these the social changes evolving from increased individualism, rapid urbanization, and the emergence of women, and it becomes clear in which direction Asia is heading. But while it has been quick to adapt Western technologies, Naisbitt explains, Asia has rejected the Western political and social formulations that run counter to its own heritage and traditions. Asia is modernizing in \"the Asian way.\"All of these megatrends will profoundly influence the way Asia does business with the West - and the way America does business with Asia. There are unprecedented opportunities and, Naisbitt warns, enormous challenges. An astute observer of the Asian scene for three decades, he spells out these pitfalls and opportunities, drawing upon a wide range of informed sources and his own interviews with political leaders, intellectuals, entrepreneurs, and businessmen and -women of many nations. With his unmatched gift for describing complex issues and events in lucid terms without distortion or oversimplification, Naisbitt is once again in the vanguard, forecasting a global shift of the world's economic, political, and cultural center of gravity that will have enormous consequences for us all.",

        "Description": "Read All About It! is a searing indictment of how the corporate owners of American newspapers have sacrificed the ideals of the free press at the altar of profit and how democracy has suffered as a result. Jim Squires comes to this subject with unimpeachable credentials: from 1981 to 1989 he was the editor of the Chicago Tribune, where he saw firsthand how the shortsightedness of corporate managers can divert a newspaper's journalistic mission and imperil its long-term economic health.With passion, style, and vivid stories, Squires makes his case by deftly and humorously interweaving his own experiences with the larger economic trends in the industry. When he first became a reporter in 1962, the old newspaper families who ran the nation's press still saw their business as a public trust. Each newspaper had a distinctive voice, and press barons like Hearst and Pulitzer influenced the world around them, even as they promoted their own politics, ideals, and personalities. In their diversity and passion lay the strength of the free press in America.But those days are gone, writes Squires, and the news business now combines the culture of television with the conscience of Wall Street. Newspaper journalism today is largely the province of large corporations which care more about private profit than public debate. Most of the old newspaper families have given up the fight - and even those that remain have become corporatized themselves. The result is an American press that is more concerned with selling its readers something than challenging or informing them.Squires reserves his harshest criticism for the \"bean counters\" who now manage most of the nation's great newspapers and who view these once-powerful voices of democracy as cash cows to be milked in the corporate financial interest. He pulls no punches in his excoriating rebuke of the executive class, laying bare their hypocrisies and their contempt for the traditional values of journalism.Unleashed and undominated, Squires sounds a call to arms against the subjugation of the free press in America - before it's too late.",

        "Authors": "By Thompson, Tracy",
        "Description": "Tracy Thompson was a well-regarded reporter for The Washington Post when, in 1989, she found herself in the terrifying, suicidal free-fall of a major depressive episode, the return of a Beast that had haunted her since her childhood in the traditionalist South.She survived - but unlike countless writers before her, Thompson did not survive to write a book about \"madness\" or about twentieth-century victimization. Instead, like a good reporter, she kept notes and asked questions. The result is a lyrical yet dispassionate account of a lifelong battle to survive a mental illness. It chronicles her struggle to reclaim her career, her growing intellectual interest in depression, and her sobering realization of the toll her illness took on the people who loved her.",

        "Description": "A scroll is discovered, buried among the ancient papyri of the Dead Sea. Although fragile and crumbling, the scroll is mostly intact, the faded lines of Koine script still legible. When Father Leo Newman, a priest from Rome, is called to Jerusalem to help decipher the scroll's meaning, he soon discovers that the text appears to be a fifth gospel - one that tells the story of Jesus' life and crucifixion from the point of view of Judas Iscariot. If the scroll is authentic - and if the radical, incendiary story it tells is true - all of Christianity itself will be open to a complete reinterpretation.Leo is poised on the brink of an abyss, for, while he unravels the mysteries of the scroll, he is also fighting an impossible attraction to a married woman, Madeleine Brewer. Leo's whole life has been held together by the strength of his faith and his intellect, but now the testimony of the Judas scroll and the desires that make him human threaten to throw his entire vocation into question. At the same time, images of his mother's passionate and tragic affair in wartime Rome are coming back to haunt him, stories of love and betrayal that may undermine his beliefs just as deeply as the Gospel of Judas.",

        "Title": "The Big Enchilada: Campaign Adventures with the Cockeyed Optimists from Texas Who Won the Biggest Prize in Politics",
        "Authors": "By Stevens, Stuart",
        "Description": "Six years ago he owned a baseball team. Now he's the leader of the free world. The Big Enchilada is a comic anthem to the wild and improbable crusade that propelled George W. Bush into the White House and to the close-knit group of Texans who made it happen, written by \"the Bush campaign's Renaissance man\" (Time magazine).  Writer and political strategist Stuart Stevens has been hailed by Martin Amis as \"the perfect companion: brave, funny, and ever-watchful,\" and The New Yorker has praised him for having \"a wonderful eye for the curiosities of human behavior.\" Here he tells the surprisingly funny, adrenaline-fueled story of the Bush campaign the public never saw -- from the Austin coffee shop where Stevens watched Karl Rove sketch out the Republican master plan on a napkin to the small Methodist church in Crawford, Texas, where the blue-jeaned future president prepared for the make-or-break debates that no one expected him to win. He offers the inside view of the rise and flameout of maverick John McCain; the struggle to come up with a message that could be heard over a booming economy (\"Times have never been better. Vote for change,\" campaign aides joked); and the fierce debates over the upside and downside of \"going negative\" against a vulnerable adversary.  Above all, Stevens turns the familiar political tale of disillusionment on its head. From the moment he arrived in Austin to join the campaign -- \"Stevens, get in here and let's bond!\" the governor said -- he discovered the peculiar pleasure of working with people who not only respected and admired their candidate but actually liked him. They faced formidable obstacles, from a nation surfing a vast wave of peace and prosperity to an experienced opponent whose seasoned advisers bragged that the campaign would be \"a slaughterhouse.\" But Texans, as Stevens learned, are a confident bunch, and the Bush crowd remained convinced they would win the biggest prize of all -- even on the brink of losing. This is the story of what it was like as only an insider could tell it.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Book of Humorous Prose: From William Caxton to P.G. Wodehouse",
        "Authors": "By Muir, Frank (EDT)",
        "Description": "If puritanism is, as H.L. Mencken once said, the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy, then this glorious, monumental collection by one of England's most popular humorists is a puritan's nightmare. Focusing primarily on the 19th and 20th century, but with material dating back to Columbus, Frank Muir has packed this volume with enough joy and laughter to sink the Mayflower.       The range of comic material is amazing--from the gentle, charming comedy of manners, to biting satire, to outrageous parody. There are excerpts from the novels of Jane Austen and P.G. Wodehouse and Mark Twain, complete short stories by O. Henry and Frank O'Connor, classic tall tales from Australia (including one by \"Banjo\" Patterson, who also wrote \"Waltzing Matilda\"), passages from Groucho Marx's correspondence with Warner Brothers, newspaper columns written by Art Buchwald and Myles na Gopaleen (the novelist Flann O'Brien), a selection of Samuel Johnson's comic definitions, plus a sprinkling of egregious puns, witty sayings, and even the clever names of stores (such as the New York restaurant \"Just for the Halibut\" and the London beauty parlor \"Curl Up and Dye\"). Muir has gathered work from over two hundred writers and from every English-speaking country. Virtually all of your favorites are here: Jonathan Swift, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Laurence Sterne, Anita Loos, Ring Lardner, Alexander Woollcott, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, S.J. Perelman, Damon Runyon, Fran Lebowitz, Joseph Heller, Evelyn Waugh, Garrison Keilor, Erma Bombeck, Tom Wolfe, and countless others. In addition, there are comic pieces from writers you wouldn't expect to find--such as Thomas Hardy or Lawrence Durrell--and many many writers you may not have discovered yet, such as Jerome K. Jerome or Daisy Ashford (who wrote an unintentionally hysterical novel at age nine, which she published in her thirties).       Frank Muir is one of Britain's best-loved humorists, the host of a highly popular television show and the prolific author of dozens of hilarious books, including the best-selling The Frank Muir Book. Here he provides not only a painfully funny collection, but also generous introductions to each writer, which are comic gems in themselves. Except for the occasional puritan, this is a book that everyone will enjoy.",

        "Authors": "By Gibson, William",
        "Description": "Reflecting our world in a uniquely haunting way, The X-Files has engendered a new look of mystery, conspiracy, phenomenon, and fear. These enigmatic, elusive images have had a profound and compelling impact on our visual reality, both feeding into and drawing from mainstream America&#39;s fascination with the subversive, the disowned, and the disillusioned. This innovative volume, a visual response to Chris Carter&#39;s dark, uneasy creation, collects the works of more than sixty cutting-edge artists.  Representing a cross section of contemporary visual arts, these photographers, painters, scultptors, graphic designers, and digital media artists have produced works that reflect their personal interpretation of The X-Files: as a cultural phenomenon, as a new chapter in television history, as an engrossing cosmic conspiracy. Many pieces are accompanied by a statement from the artist, explaining the inspiration behind his or her contribution--ranging from an episode to a line of dialouge, form a particular incident to a theme within the entire series. Illustrated with video stills from the episodes, this volume shows the strong influence of The X-Files imagery on the artistic mind.  In this introduction to this powerful collection of images, acclaimed writer William Gibson noted that The X-Files \"is a disturbing and viscerally satisfying expression of where we&#39;ve come from, where we are today, and all those places we simultaneously yearn and dread to go.\" Starling, beautiful, and thought-provoking, this unusual volume expands the creative vision of The X-Files, and of contemporary art itself.",
