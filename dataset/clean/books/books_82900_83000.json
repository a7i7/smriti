        "Title": "The Stupid Crook Book (Volume 1)",
        "Authors": "By Gregory, Leland",
        "Description": "Police arrived on the scene of a recreational vehicle park to discover a very sick man vomiting and complaining of stomach cramps. The man admitted he had attempted to siphon gas from a motor home but inadvertently put the siphon tube in the wrong tank. Instead of gasoline, the man sucked out the contents of the sewage holding tank. If stupidity were lethal, all of the criminals highlighted in The Stupid Crook Book would be dead. This book from highly successful author Leland H. Gregory III captures hilarious tales of captured criminals who are so dumb you almost feel sorry for them. Almost. This lineup of criminal bozos includes: * Michael Anthony Silver, who made a $250 call to a 1-900 psychic hotline in the course of robbing a home. When the phone bill came later that month the homeowners called the police, who traced the call back to the hotline. It turns out Silver used his real name with the psychic.* A would-be bank robber who fainted when a bank teller told him she had no money. The police later found his getaway car and discovered the key locked inside it.* Tony Bariteau, who was arrested and pled guilty to breaking into the Deja Vu store in Troy, Alabama-twice! He was arrested because the same witness spotted him smashing the same window and stealing much of the same merchandise. Deja vu indeed.* A wanted fugitive from Maryland who was running low on cash and stopped by a police station in Texas to ask for gas money. The police saved him the expense and gave him a free ride back to prison.The Stupid Crook Book builds on the successful trail Gregory blazed with America's Dumbest Criminals, the book he coauthored that spent 17 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.

Written in a charming, engaging style, it is a contemporary corporate fable\u2014a tale for our times. This special 20th anniversary edition includes many new tips, tools, and strategies for peacocks and penguins alike\u2014as well as an entirely new bonus parable. Through the story of Perry the Peacock and his fine feathered friends, authors Gallagher and Schmidt bring to life the challenges of birds of different feathers who struggle to be successful in the conformity-minded Land of Penguins. Their travails illuminate the challenges of creating a pluralistic corporate culture in which the talent, energy, and commitment of all employees are fully engaged.  People who have new ideas that differ from business as usual are often ignored or criticized for the very thing that makes them valuable: their originality and creativity. This unique book helps organizations break out of \"penguin thinking\u201d in order to tap into and leverage the creativity of diversity. Learn how to cultivate an organizational culture in which new ideas can flourish and innovation can take flight.",

When Francesca -- an artist whose risqu\u00e9 paintings are much desired by wealthy gentlemen buyers -- learns of Admiral Lord Nelson's decree that no lady may gain passage on an English ship without a husband, she dares to do the unthinkable: find an eligible English bachelor and marry him at once.  Estranged from his noble family, Captain Lord Edward Ramsden has built a stellar naval career. Proper and upstanding, he shocks himself by impulsively exchanging vows with this forward and flirtatious lady in distress. But in London, their mock marriage is turned upside down when Edward is unexpectedly named a duke -- and Francesca his unlikely duchess -- stunning the genteel ton. Their newfound social status invites danger and scandal -- and now the duke risks all to win the heart of the woman he loves madly -- his bold-spirited duchess.",

In this imaginative and surprisingly profound book, Stephen Kendrick reveals Sherlock Holmes as spiritual guide. Drawing on the teachings of Christianity, Buddhism, and Judaism--as well as a host of thinkers as varied as Albert Einstein, Gandhi, and Vincent van Gogh--Kendrick explores the stories of Sherlock Holmes and finds remarkably prescient religious insights. He shows us the link between careful observation of clues and the Buddhist concept of \"Bare Attention.\" He illuminates the parallel between the great sleuth's pursuit of justice and God's actions on the scene of the first murder, when Cain slew Abel. And in the detective's open, engaged mind, Kendrick finds a model for uniting the principles of science with a sincere spiritual quest. The result is a book of inspiration for the modern, skeptical searcher--and an entertaining work that sheds new light on the methods of the world's greatest detective.",

More than 200 color photographs capture the many qualities described.In an anecdotal style, and with infectious enthusiasm, Christopher Brickell offers wealth of planting advice, as well as useful tips on many aspects of honing the gardener's skill. Expert guidance is given on the selection and maintenance of all major plant categories - trees, shrubs, climbers and wall shrubs, herbaceous perennials bulbs, alpines warm-climate and greenhouse plants, and short-lived plants.The plants are organized by season, with separate sections for those \"high-performance\" plants that do well in more than one season. This arrangement makes it easy for the reader to adopt the author's planting choices to create year-round impact in the garden, with carefully staged seasonal highlights.At the back of the book is a practical reference section, which includes detailed listings of nurseries and other sources of plants.Produced in association with The Royal Horticultural Society, The Gardener's Companion is an authoritative plant selector wide a personal voice. For the enthusiastic novice as much as for the committed gardener, this indispensable guide promotes new standards of excellence in the garden, distilling the taste and expertise of one of the world's foremost plant experts.",
