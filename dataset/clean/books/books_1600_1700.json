Only one thing can ease the physical torture of waitressing at a local Mexican restaurant \u2014 a dreamy waiter named Ethan who definitely has romantic designs on . . . Disha, Janet's best friend.  Janet, of course, is mature enough to get over it \u2014 except for the fact that Disha now won't hang out with anyone but her possessive new beau.  And if that's not appalling enough, even the Mad Cow is newly besotted \u2014 with a bearded suitor who has her singing old folk songs and boycotting evil corporate greed.  Good thing Janet is sensible enough to start an advice column for the school paper and has her mates David and Marcus to talk to, as the entire female species seems to have gone insane.Detailed in humorously melodramatic diary entries and including a glossary of Britishisms, PLANET JANET IN ORBIT follows the precarious path of a comically self-absorbed teen who is learning some useful lessons about loyalty, family, and friendship.",

Presidential Inaugurations is no exception, as it illuminates the new life of the president from the moment he is elected to the moment he takes office. As might be expected from the most knowledgeable observer of American presidents, every chapter brings fresh delights that range from the sublime to, inevitably, the ridiculous. Boller accompanies Lincoln on his mysterious first entrance into Washington and renders the poignancy of FDR's last inauguration. There is the surprising appearance of Tallulah Bankhead at Truman's inauguration and the charming report on Eisenhower's 1953 inaugural by Jacqueline Bouvier. Highlighting inaugural moments from 1789 to 2001, Presidential Inaugurations presents the United States displaying its pride, its passions, and its prejudices as it greets a new leader.",

But instead of ending her life, this cataclysmic event sparks a strange and powerful new beginning.After the lightning strike, the chill in her spirit starts to have physical manifestations.

Hearing of a fellow lightning-strike survivor - a man who was apparently dead for forty minutes, then simply got up and walked away - she goes in search of him. Perhaps Lazarus Jones, as he is known, can teach her to live without fear. He turns out to be her perfect opposite, a man whose breath can boil water and whose touch scorches. As an obsessive love affair begins between them, both hide their most dangerous secrets - what happened in the past that turned one to ice and the other to fire. And everyone in her fragile network of friends and family will be drawn into the conflagration of their joining.",

Many entries are accompanied by sections that focus on specific themes, such as singing dynasties, the relationships between opera and cinema and between the opera singer and the impresario, the origins of American opera, the artistic and musical life that accompanies a festival, madness in opera, and operas as symbols of great theaters.

        "Authors": "By Harry, Mikel J. and Schroeder, Richard",
        "Description": "The extraordinary breakthrough management program--heralded by GE, Motorola, and AlliedSignal--that is sweeping corporate America with its unprecedented ability to achieve superior financial results.Six Sigma is the most powerful breakthrough management tool ever devised, promising increased market share, cost reductions, and dramatic improvements in bottom-line profitability for companies of any size. The darling of Wall Street, it has become the mantra of Fortune 500 boardrooms around the world because it works.What is Six Sigma? It is first and foremost a business process that enables companies to increase profits dramatically by streamlining operations, improving quality, and eliminating defects or mistakes in everything a company does, from filling out purchase orders to manufacturing airplane engines. While traditional quality programs have focused on detecting and correcting defects, Six Sigma encompasses something broader: It provides specific methods to re-create the process itself so that defects are never produced in the first place.Most companies operate at a three- to four-sigma level, where the cost of defects is roughly 20 to 30 percent of revenues. By approaching Six Sigma--fewer than one defect per 3.4 million opportunities--the cost of quality drops to less than 1 percent of sales.This is because the highest quality also results in the lowest costs. When GE reduced its costs from 20 percent to less than 10 percent, it saved a billion dollars in just two years--money that goes directly to the bottom line. This is the reason Wall Street and corporations as diverse as Sony, Ford, Nokia, Texas Instruments, Canon, Hitachi, Lockheed Martin, American Express, Toshiba, DuPont, and Polaroid have embarked on corporate-wide Six Sigma programs.Six Sigma should be of paramount importance to every forward-thinking executive and manager determined to make their company world-class in their industry.",

        "Authors": "By Craig, David (ILT) and Tanaka, Shelley",
        "Description": "It was the greatest invasion the world had ever seen. Officially known as \"Operation Overlord,\" this World War II assault began on the morning of June 6, 1944. Thousands of American, British, and Canadian soldiers aboard hundreds of landing craft attacked beaches along nearly fifty miles of France's coastline in Normandy. Backing them up were the big guns of some of the mightiest ships in the Allied navies, and countless bomber, fighter, and transport aircraft. By the end of that day, an Allied army had made it ashore despite sometimes fierce opposition, signaling the end of Nazi tyranny over Europe. Using the real-life stories of young men caught up in this great event, along with original paintings, photographs, and memorabilia, D-Day, the book, will present a compelling account of this world-changing day. Shelly Tanaka is the author of many acclaimed books of nonfiction for children, including the first two books in The Day That Changed America Series: Gettysburg and The Alamo. She is also the author of Attack on Pearl Harbor and many of the books in the \"I Was There\" series.",

        "Title": "Railroads Triumphant: The Growth, Rejection, and Rebirth of a Vital American Force",
        "Authors": "By Martin, Albro",
        "Description": "In 1789, when the First Congress met in New York City, the members traveled to the capital just as Roman senators two thousand years earlier had journeyed to Rome, by horse, at a pace of some five miles an hour. Indeed, if sea travel had improved dramatically since Caesar's time, overland travel was still so slow, painful, and expensive that most Americans lived all but rooted to the spot, with few people settling more than a hundred miles from the ocean (a mere two percent lived west of the Appalachians). America in effect was just a thin ribbon of land by the sea, and it wasn't until the coming of the steam railroad that our nation would unfurl across the vast inland territory.     In Railroads Triumphant, Albro Martin provides a fascinating history of rail transportation in America, moving well beyond the \"Romance of the Rails\" sort of narrative to give readers a real sense of the railroad's importance to our country. The railroad, Martin argues, was \"the most fundamental innovation in American material life.\" It could go wherever rails could be laid--and so, for the first time, farms, industries, and towns could leave natural waterways behind and locate anywhere. (As Martin points out, the railroads created small-town America just as surely as the automobile created the suburbs.) The railroad was our first major industry, and it made possible or promoted the growth of all other industries, among them coal, steel, flour milling, and commercial farming. It established such major cities as Chicago, and had a lasting impact on urban design. And it worked hand in hand with the telegraph industry to transform communication. Indeed, the railroads were the NASA of the 19th century, attracting the finest minds in finance, engineering, and law.     But Martin doesn't merely catalogue the past greatness of the railroad. In closing with the episodes that led first to destructive government regulation, and then to deregulation of the railroads and the ensuing triumphant rebirth of the nation's basic means of moving goods from one place to another, Railroads Triumphant offers an impassioned defense of their enduring importance to American economic life. And it is a book informed by a lifelong love of railroads, brimming with vivid descriptions of classic depots, lavish hotels in Chicago, the great railroad founders, and the famous lines. Thoughtful and colorful by turn, this insightful history illuminates the impact of the railroad on our lives.",

Are the bones those of a mother and child? Are they actual human remains or fakes? Were they planted there - and if so, why?It could be nothing more than a ruthless and enterprising pub owner looking to create a local legend that will help lure trade. Or it could be something far worse - something as grisly as the death of a recent immigrant found brutally murdered at a local housing project, or the murder of Donald Cruikshank, a recently paroled rapist whose body is found just as a young woman goes missing. The missing girl is a friend of Inspector rebus's colleague Detective Siobhan Clarke, and Siobhan is shocked to find herself in the same intricate web of murderers as Rebus - all somehow tied to that pile of bones under Fleshmarket Alley.In a race to stop the killings before more bodies turn up - even as the possibility of romantic entanglements distracts and entices them - rebus and Siobhan plumb the darkest corners of their beloved city and confront the lawless, conscienceless men who dwell there.",

        "Description": "Peter Arnett is undeniably the dean of his generation's war correspondents, a breed apart. Daring, wily, willing to put himself at enormous risk for a story. Arnett is a thinking man and a man of action.From his youth in New Zealand in the 1940s, Arnett knew journalism would be his ticket to the world. And it was - to Bangkok; then to Laos, where Arnett swam across the Mekong River to file his dispatches from Thailand; and then on to Indonesia, where he traveled with Sukarno until he was expelled after only thirteen months for his reporting on the developing war.In 1962, Arnett was sent to Vietnam along with David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan, Mal Browne, Stanley Karnow and the rest of a new young group of foreign correspondents that would later include Dan Rather, Ted Koppel and Peter Jennings. When American ground forces were committed, Arnett went right in with them. His controversial coverage for the Associated Press incurred the wrath of President Johnson but won him a Pulitzer Prize. After the fall of Saigon, when many of his peers had gone, Arnett stayed behind to get the whole story.With the dedication, passion and intelligence that one finds in great foreign correspondents, Arnett has pursued the whole story ever since. After covering wars in Cyprus and Lebanon, he joined CNN in 1981. News was going live, twenty-four hours a day, and Arnett was going with it - from San Salvador to Moscow to Iraq. And then to Afghanistan, after the defeat of the Soviet-sponsored government, a place of anarchic conflict, where Islamic radicals plot to export terrorism to the mainland United States.Satellite communications have forever changed the way we see war. Arnett's on-the-ground reporting of the Gulf War from Baghdad had an immediacy and suspense we had not experienced before. No one who watched will ever forget.Now, in the same vivid eye-of-the-Desert-Storm way in which he reported the drama and danger of the Gulf War, Peter Arnett shares the adventures, the gambles and the glory of his lifemore than thirty-five years inside the world's war zones.",

In this rollicking follow-up to Tim Cockey's \"witty, punchy, snappy, well-written, and dang funny debut\" (Harlan Coben, author of The Final Detail), a surprise blizzard dumps more than snow on the steps of Sewell & Sons funeral home--it leaves behind the corpse of a murdered waitress as well. Hitch's television meteorologist girlfriend sees the crime as an opportunity to move into hard news. Her unctuous mentor wants to beat Hitch to the punch. Hitch's snooping takes him from low-life strip joints to high-tone mansions, proving yet again that undertakers and their clue-happy cohorts can be a pretty lively bunch.",

        "Description": "Now available in paperback, the New York Times bestseller. When John F. Kennedy called America \"the land we love\" more than 42 years ago, he was reminding us of the lofty ideals on which our country was founded. But what are those ideals, and how have Americans defined them Is America the land of George Washington and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who rallied the country's spirits for unity in wartime, or is it a land of dissent, a land in which Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Martin Luther King, Jr. remind us of our duty to protect our most fundamental freedoms? Are we defined by the speeches of Thomas Jefferson and Ronald Reagan or by the humor of H.L. Mencken and Mark Twain? Caroline Kennedy's answer in A Patriot's Handbook is that we are all of those things and more. The poems, songs, speeches, letters, and historical documents that Caroline Kennedy has chosen for this remarkable collection remind us of the foundations on which America was built. But they also ask us to examine what it truly means to be a \"patriot,\" even if our assumptions are challenged along the way, because it is only by doing so that America can \"truly be our own.\" Voices as diverse as the nation itself:  Thomas Jefferson Cole Porter Chief Red Jacket Amy Tan Betty Friedan Albert Einstein George W.

        "Description": "\"I'm still here, still arriving at the White House in the wee hours of the morning, reading the papers and checking the wire, still waiting for the morning briefing, still sitting down to write the first story of the day and still waiting to ask the tough questions.\"  From the woman who has reported on every president from Kennedy to Clinton for United Press International: a unique glimpse into the White House -- and a telling record of the ever-changing relationship between the presidency and the press.  From her earliest years, Helen Thomas wanted to be a reporter. Raised in Depression-era Detroit, she worked her way to Washington after college and, unlike other women reporters who gave up their jobs to returning veterans, parlayed her copy-aide job at the Washington Daily News into a twelve-year stint as a radio news writer for UPI, covering such beats as the Department of Justice and other federal agencies.  Assigned to the White House press corps in 1961, Thomas was the first woman to close a press conference with \"Thank you, Mr. President,\" and has covered every administration since Kennedy's. Along the way, she was among the pioneers who broke down barriers against women in the national media, becoming the first female president of the White House Correspondents Association, the first female officer of the National Press Club and the first woman member, later president, of the Gridiron Club.  In this revealing memoir, which includes hundreds of anecdotes, insights, observations, and personal details, Thomas looks back at a career spent with presidents at home and abroad, on the ground and in the air. She evaluates the enormous changes that Watergate brought, including diminished press access to the Oval Office, and how they have affected every president since Nixon. Providing a unique view of the past four decades of presidential history, Front Row at the White House offers a seasoned study of the relationship between the chief executive officer and the press -- a relationship that is sometimes uneasy, sometimes playful, yet always integral to democracy.  \"Soon enough there will be another president, another first lady, another press secretary and a whole new administration to discover. I'm looking forward to it -- although I'm sure whoever ends up in the Oval Office in a new century may not be so thrilled about the prospect.\"",
