        "Title": "Unlikely Allies: How a Merchant, a Playwright, and a Spy Saved the American Revolution",
        "Authors": "By Paul, Joel Richard",
        "Description": "The gripping true story of how three men used espionage, betrayal, and sexual deception to help win the American Revolution. Unlikely Allies is the story of three remarkable historical figures. Silas Deane was a Connecticut merchant and delegate to the Continental Congress as the American colonies struggled to break with England. Caron de Beaumarchais was a successful playwright who wrote The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro. And the flamboyant and mysterious Chevalier d?Eon ?officer, diplomat, and sometime spy?was the talk of London and Paris. Is the Chevalier a man or a woman? When Deane is sent to France to convince the French government to support the revolutionary cause, he enlists the help of Beaumarchais. Together, they successfully smuggle weapons, ammunition, and supplies to New England just in time for the crucial Battle of Saratoga, which turned the tide of the American Revolution. And the catalyst for Louis XVI?s support of the Americans against England was the Chevalier d?Eon, whose decision to declare herself a woman helped to lead to the Franco-American alliance. These three people spin a fascinating web of political intrigue and international politics that stretches across oceans as they ricochet from Versailles to Georgian London to the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) in Philadelphia. Each man has his own reasons for wanting to see America triumph over the British, and each contends daily with the certainty that no one is what they seem. The line between friends and enemies is blurred, spies lurk in every corner, and the only way to survive is to trust no one. An edge-of-your-seat story full of fascinating characters and lavish with period detail and sense of place, Unlikely Allies is Revolutionary history in all of its juicy, lurid glory.",

        "Description": "Dear Readers,There are at least five good reasons to Tip It! right now.1. My daughter Kathy put out her memoir last year, which was real nice except for the controversial parts. And it got to be a #1 New York Times bestseller. Congratulations, Kathleen! But now it\u2019s my turn. I\u2019ve written my own book. I have things to say, too, without having to be all controversial like you were. Tip it! 2. People recognize me on the street a lot now and come over, nicely, and say \u201cMaggie, you remind me of my own mother.\u201d And they say \u201cMaggie, I love your show\u201d\u2014referring to Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List as my show. Sometimes I correct them, I say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s not my show.\u201d But sometimes . . . I don\u2019t correct them. It\u2019s kind of fun being a star, isn\u2019t it Tip it! 3. If you want to know a few things about my daughter Kathleen that only a mother could know (How the heck did she get this way? Did she always swear so much, for Chrissake?), you have come to the right book. Tip it! 4. You know how a box of wine is never empty just because the spigot seems to have run dry (There\u2019s always a little more if you just tip it!) This book is like that. There\u2019s so much in it\u2014never-before-published Griffin family photos!, a love story (me and my dear departed husband Johnny), a whole guide to good living (including how to survive on what\u2019s in your purse), and a lot of funny business in this book from Kathleen (she made comments in this book; readers, I was not able to stop her!). So take this book and Tip It! 5. And be sure to get the last drop out of living. Isn\u2019t it nice that \u201cTip It\u201d acts as a toast I\u2019m 90 years old, and I think \u201cTip It!\u201d even works pretty well as a motto for living to the fullest. So, Tip It! today.Yours,Maggie GriffinA funny thing happened on the way to Kathy Griffin\u2019s skyrocketing stardom. The more she told stories about her mother, Maggie, in her stand-up act and on her Emmy-winning television show, Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List, the more popular her mother became. (At the mere mention of Maggie, a stadium full of fans will cheer, \u201cTip It! Tip It!\u201d)Shocked by Kathy, exasperated by Kathy, grudgingly amused by Kathy, and at the end of the day, always a loving mother to Kathy, Maggie Griffin has become the darling Gracie to Kathy\u2019s George Burns, the wry Cher to Kathy\u2019s Sonny Bono, the spry, sweet Roadrunner to Kathy\u2019s Wile E.

        "Authors": "By Ross, Adam",
        "Description": "David Pepin has been in love with his wife, Alice, since the moment they met in a university seminar on Alfred Hitchcock. After thirteen years of marriage, he still can\u2019t imagine a remotely happy life without her\u2014yet he obsessively contemplates her demise. Soon she is dead, and David is both deeply distraught and the prime suspect.The detectives investigating Alice\u2019s suspicious death have plenty of personal experience with conjugal enigmas: Ward Hastroll is happily married until his wife inexplicably becomes voluntarily and militantly bedridden; and Sam Sheppard is especially sensitive to the intricacies of marital guilt and innocence, having decades before been convicted and then exonerated of the brutal murder of his wife.Still, these men are in the business of figuring things out, even as Pepin\u2019s role in Alice\u2019s death grows ever more confounding when they link him to a highly unusual hit man called Mobius. Like the Escher drawings that inspire the computer games David designs for a living, these complex, interlocking dramas are structurally and emotionally intense, subtle, and intriguing; they brilliantly explore the warring impulses of affection and hatred, and pose a host of arresting questions. Is it possible to know anyone fully, completely? Are murder and marriage two sides of the same coin, each endlessly recycling into the other? And what, in the end, is the truth about love?Mesmerizing, exhilarating, and profoundly moving, Mr. Peanut is a police procedural of the soul, a poignant investigation of the relentlessly mysterious human heart\u2014and a first novel of the highest order.",

But, until now, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy have never told this astonishing tale in their own way and with their own words.For Leigh Anne and Sean, it all begins with family. Leigh Anne, the daughter of a tough-as-nails U.S. marshal, decided early on that her mission was to raise children who would become \"cheerful givers.\" Sean, who grew up poor, believed that one day he could provide a home that would be \"a place of miracles.\" Together, they raised two high-spirited children-Collins and Sean Jr.-who shared their deep Christian faith and their commitment to making a difference. And then one day Leigh Anne met a homeless African American boy named Michael and decided that her family could be his. She and her husband taught Michael what this book teaches all of us: everyone has a blind side, but a loving heart always sees a path toward true charity.Michael Oher's improbable transformation could never have happened if Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy had not opened their hearts to him. In this touching, funny, and profoundly inspiring book, the Tuohys take us on an extraordinary journey of faith and love-and teach us unforgettable lessons about the power of cheerful giving.",

        "Description": "Considered to be \u201cas monumental\u2014and enigmatic\u2014a legend as American sport has ever seen\u201d ( Sports Illustrated ), Willie Mays is arguably the greatest player in baseball history, still revered for the joy and passion he brought to the game. Mays began as a teenage phenom in the Negro Leagues, became a cult hero in New York, and was the headliner in Major League Baseball\u2019s bold expansion to California. With 3,383 hits, 660 home runs, and 338 stolen bases, he was a blend of power, speed, and stylistic bravado that fans had never seen before. Now, in the first biography authorized by and written with the cooperation of Willie Mays, James Hirsch reveals the man behind the player..Willie is perhaps best known for \u201cThe Catch\u201d\u2014his breathtaking over-the-shoulder grab in the 1954 World Series. It is a classic visual that represents a transcendent figure who ushered in a new era of baseball, received standing ovations around the globe, and\u2014during the turbulent civil rights era\u2014advocated understanding and reconciliation. However, the years of racial attacks, the stress of celebrity, and the mental and physical demands of the game also took a toll. Meticulously researched and drawing on lengthy interviews with Mays, as well as with close friends, family, and teammates, Hirsch presents a complex portrait of one of America\u2019s most significant cultural icons..",

It is a story of mid-life longings and discoveries, of lessons learned in the search for home and a new sense of purpose, and the bittersweet intensity of life with teenagers--holding on, letting go.   Poised on the threshold between family life as she's always known it and her older son's departure for college, Kenison is surprised to find that the times she treasures most  are the ordinary, unremarkable moments of everyday life, the very moments that she once took for granted, or rushed right through without noticing at all.  The relationships, hopes, and dreams that Kenison illuminates will touch women's hearts, and her words will inspire mothers everywhere as they try to make peace with the inevitable changes in store.",

        "Description": "A revealing, forward-looking examination of the outsize influence Google has had on the changing media Landscape. There are companies that create waves and those that ride or are drowned by them. As only he can, bestselling author Ken Auletta takes readers for a ride on the Google wave, telling the story of how it formed and crashed into traditional media businesses?from newspapers to books, to television, to movies, to telephones, to advertising, to Microsoft. With unprecedented access to Google?s founders and executives, as well as to those in media who are struggling to keep their heads above water, Auletta reveals how the industry is being disrupted and redefined. Using Google as a stand-in for the digital revolution, Auletta takes readers inside Google?s closed-door meetings and paints portraits of Google?s notoriously private founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, as well as those who work with?and against?them. In his narrative, Auletta provides the fullest account ever told of Google?s rise, shares the ?secret sauce? of Google?s success, and shows why the worlds of ?new? and ?old? media often communicate as if residents of different planets. Google engineers start from an assumption that the old ways of doing things can be improved and made more efficient, an approach that has yielded remarkable results? Google will generate about $20 billion in advertising revenues this year, or more than the combined prime-time ad revenues of CBS, NBC, ABC, and FOX. And with its ownership of YouTube and its mobile phone and other initiatives, Google CEO Eric Schmidt tells Auletta his company is poised to become the world?s first $100 billion media company. Yet there are many obstacles that threaten Google?s future, and opposition from media companies and government regulators may be the least of these. Google faces internal threats, from its burgeoning size to losing focus to hubris. In coming years, Google?s faith in mathematical formulas and in slide rule logic will be tested, just as it has been on Wall Street. Distilling the knowledge accrued from a career of covering the media, Auletta will offer insights into what we know, and don?t know, about what the future holds for the imperiled industry.",

The Audacity to Win is his story of that   groundbreaking achievement, taking readers inside the remarkable campaign that led to the election of the first   African American president. For two years Plouffe worked side by side with Obama, charting the course   of the campaign. His is the ultimate insider\u2019s tale, revealing both the strategies that delivered Obama to office and   how the candidate and campaign handled moments of great challenge and opportunity. Moving from the   deliberations about whether to run at all, through the epic primary battle with Hillary Clinton and the general   election against John McCain, Plouffe showcases the high-wire gamesmanship that fascinated pundits and the   drama and intrigue that captivated a nation. The Audacity to Win chronicles the arrival of a new   moment in American life at the convergence of digital technology and grassroots organization, and the exciting   possibilities revealed by a campaign that in many ways functioned as a $1 billion start-up with laser-like focus and   discipline. In this extraordinary book, David Plouffe unfolds one of the most important political stories of our time,   one whose lessons are not limited to politics, but reach to the greatest heights of what we dream about for our   country and ourselves.

If not, you may be missing out on a potent competitive tool.In Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning, Thomas H. Davenport and Jeanne G. Harris argue that the frontier for using data to make decisions has shifted dramatically. Certain high-performing enterprises are now building their competitive strategies around data-driven insights that in turn generate impressive business results. Their secret weapon? Analytics: sophisticated quantitative and statistical analysis and predictive modeling.Exemplars of analytics are using new tools to identify their most profitable customers and offer them the right price, to accelerate product innovation, to optimize supply chains, and to identify the true drivers of financial performance. A wealth of examples&#151;from organizations as diverse as Amazon, Barclay\u2019s, Capital One, Harrah\u2019s, Procter & Gamble, Wachovia, and the Boston Red Sox&#151;illuminate how to leverage the power of analytics.",

Our local newspaper ran a front-page story not too long ago about a study revealing that one in five people in our city lives in poverty. This is a book about those two numbers.Jesus Wants to save Christians is a book about faith and fear, wealth and war, poverty, power, safety, terror, Bibles, bombs, and homeland insecurity. It's about empty empires and the truth that everybody's a priest. It's about oppression, occupation, and what happens when Christians support, animate and participate in the very things Jesus came to set people free from. It's about what it means to be a part of the church of Jesus in a world where some people fly planes into buildings while others pick up groceries in Hummers.",

        "Description": "The Golden Gate Bridge links the urbanity of San Francisco with the wild headlands of Marin County, as if to suggest the paradox of California and America itself-the place that Fitzgerald saw as the last spot commensurate with the human capacity for wonder. The bridge, completed in 1937, also announced to the world America's engineering prowess and full assumption of its destined continental dominance. The Golden Gate is a counterpart to the Statue of Liberty, pronouncing American achievement in an unmistakable American fashion. The nation's very history is expressed in the bridge's art deco style and stark verticality. Kevin Starr's Golden Gate is a brilliant and passionate telling of the history of the bridge, and the rich and peculiar history of the California experience. The Golden Gate is a grand public work, a symbol and a very real bridge, a magnet for both postcard photographs and suicides. In this compact but comprehensive narrative, Starr unfolds the hidden-in-plain-sight meaning of the Golden Gate, putting it in its place among classic works of art.",

        "Description": "Noted campaign scholars James W. Ceaser, Andrew E. Busch, and John J. Pitney Jr. take readers along on the longest, most expensive, and in many ways most dramatic presidential campaign in American history. Drawing on their extensive knowledge of political history and deep resources of current political science, the authors capture the astonishing twists of fate, uncanny detours, and remarkable surprises that made the 2008 election truly historic. With President George W. Bush's approval ratings at record lows, the 2008 election was a contest that Democrats were predicted to win. And with Barack Obama's victory over John McCain, they did. But it was the highly unlikely journey to this likely destination that set this presidential election apart from others. As they have every four years since 1992, James W. Ceaser and Andrew E. Busch once again provide the most comprehensive and authoritative account of the presidential election. Joined on this book by John J. Pitney Jr., the authors chronicle the epic journey culminating in the election of the first African American president_of a group of extraordinary candidates and a nation.Epic Journey Authors' Blog: www.epicjourney2008.com",

After being released from prison and winning South Africa's first free election, Nelson Mandela presided over a country still deeply divided by fifty years of apartheid. His plan was ambitious if not far-fetched: use the national rugby team, the Springboks-long an embodiment of white-supremacist rule-to embody and engage a new South Africa as they prepared to host the 1995 World Cup. The string of wins that followed not only defied the odds, but capped Mandela's miraculous effort to bring South Africans together again in a hard-won, enduring bond.",

        "Description": "An established resource through three editions, the  Introductory Textbook of Psychiatry has been thoroughly revised and tightened up to make it an even more effective text. The authors, long respected as teachers, clinicians, and researchers, have trimmed the content of the previous edition to make the book more practical and easier to use. Throughout, they continue to interweave recent advances in psychiatry with the core knowledge that students new to the field need-from grasping the neurobiology and genetics of mental illness to understanding the DSM system to assessing patients.

It introduces students to a wide range of psychiatric diagnoses-covering epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment-while providing additional coverage of special topics such as violence and suicide, legal issues that affect psychiatry, childhood disorders, sleep disorders, and both psychosocial and somatic therapies. As a teaching resource, it boasts several key features: \u2022 tools that enhance learning, such as compelling case vignettes and \"clinical pearls\"-even more numerous in this edition-plus self-assessment questions\u2022 a detailed introduction to the interview process, including specific questions that the clinician might ask patients\u2022 a critical review of DSM-IV-TR covering all disorders, arranged by diagnostic class\u2022 eleven chapters devoted to specific conditions, from cognitive disorders to personality disorders to impulse-control disorders, with handy tables of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, practical assessment tips, and other key points\u2022 a single-chapter introduction to the basics of child psychiatry, covering mental retardation, autism, ADHD, and more\u2022 up-to-date information on drugs-including newer antidepressants-and guidelines for electroconvulsive therapy\u2022 a glossary of key psychiatric terms, new to this edition Useful as either an introductory text or a primary reference, the  Textbook encourages students to appreciate the art and science of contemporary psychiatry and to enjoy working with psychiatric patients. And as a concise summary of the field, it also serves as a reliable and an eminently readable refresher for busy practitioners.",

Suddenly, this mother of a six-year-old is the young widow in a bucolic small town. And this is only the beginning. Seven months after Henry's death, just when Julie thinks she is emerging from the worst of it, comes the rest of it: She discovers that what had appeared to be the reality of her marriage was but a half-truth. Henry had hidden another life from her.\"He loved you so much.\" That's what everyone keeps telling her. It's true that he loved Julie and their six-year-old daughter ebulliently and devotedly, but as she starts to pick up the pieces and rebuild her life without Henry in it, she learns that Henry had been unfaithful throughout their twelve years of marriage. The most damaging affair was ongoing--a tumultuous relationship that ended only with Henry's death.For Julie, the only thing to do was to get at the real truth--to strip away the veneer of \"perfection\" that was her life and confront each of the women beneath the veneer.Perfection is the story of Julie Metz's journey through chaos and transformation as she creates a different life for herself and her young daughter. It is the story of coming to terms with painful truths, of rebuilding both a life and an identity after betrayal and widowhood. It is a story of rebirth and happiness--if not perfection.",
