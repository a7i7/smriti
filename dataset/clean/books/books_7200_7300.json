What happens over the next four years will challenge the things he holds infallible: his faith, his heritage, and his parents\u2019 omniscience. As we follow Porter\u2019s college career, full of outrageous pranks and ribald humor, we sense a quiet, constant flow toward maturity. Peppered with memorable characters and resonant with details of place and time, The Whisper of the River is filled with the richness of spirit that makes great fiction. \u00a0 \"Wry, incisive, delicately structured, emotionally complex, and hilarious.\" --\u00a0Atlanta Magazine",

Starring in MTV's most popular show ever, the Osbournes have proven that the family of a heavy metal superstar can teach America what parenting is all about with their new twist on family values. So what's made Ozzy into such a great father? Experience. You name it, he's done it. He's bitten the heads off doves and bats, urinated on the Alamo (while wearing a woman's dress!), and been addicted to drink and drugs. With his first band, Black Sabbath, he practically invented heavy metal. As a solo performer, he's sold millions of albums, and helped turn the annual Ozzfest tour into one of the biggest events in music.Learn how Ozzy went from being banned at the Alamo to a guest at the White House, from bats to Beverly Hills. It's all in here, with plenty of trivia-like why oldest daughter, Aimee, didn't want to be a part of series- and all the parenting tips any father needs to be as good a dad as Ozzy.",

        "Description": "In 1996, there were violent intrastate conflicts in ninety countries around the world. Governments, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and scholars continue to investigate how these deadly conflicts can be prevented. In order to assess what has been learned about conflict prevention and encourage further examination of cases and strategies, the Center for Preventive Action (CPA) of the Council on Foreign Relations convenes an annual conference. CPA's December 1996 Conference on Preventive Action examined three regions where CPA has programs--Nigeria, the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, and the South Balkans--and three tools of prevention--religion, economic sanctions and incentives, and small weapons disarmament. This conference volume is the second book in CPA's series of Preventive Action Reports. It uses CPA's case studies to examine the effectiveness of the tools of preventive action, and draws on comparative studies to guide the analysis of the case studies. Included: Edward J. Laurance of the Monterey Institute of International Studies on small weapons disarmament; David Cortright of the Fourth Freedom Forum and George Lopez of the Kroc Institute of International Peace Studies, University of Notre Dame, on the use of economic sanctions and incentives; Reverend Donald Shriver of Union Theological Seminary on religion and violence prevention; Steven Burg of Brandeis University on the South Balkans; Michael Lund of Creative Associates International on Burundi and the Great Lakes region of Central Africa; and Peter Lewis of American University on Nigeria.",

James Kennedy takes readers to the core of today's cultural erosion.The United States' rich heritage of Christian liberty is now being corrupted by those who are trying to rewrite or reinterpret history. Even our traditional values are being undermined by our educational system. More than ever, we need to assert the truth - the truth of the existence of sin and of the absolute nature of morality.As Christians, we have the hope and promise of ultimate victory, but it is not enough to merely hope for better things. We have been a \"silent majority\" for too long - it is time to become committed. It takes everyone. As Dr. Kennedy says, \"Somehow, somewhere, we must all be involved.\"Character - the \"sense that things have eternal consequences\" - is a foundational principle in the Christian life. Character & Destiny challenges all Christians with the paramount question, \"Do we have the resolve to make character once more a priority in our lives?\"",

The message remains just as urgent today as it did eight years ago: while much has been accomplished, we must meet a global environmental challenge that reaches into every aspect of our society.In brave and unforgettable terms, Earth in the Balance probes the roots of the environmental crisis and offers a bold and forceful vision of a new, more sustainable path. Having provoked international discussion upon its original publication, it continues to confront us with profound challenges. Human civilization must change its course if we are to heal our ailing environment and preserve the earth's ecology for future generations.Vice President Gore describes in a new foreword to this classic what we have achieved and what remains to be done, and issues a clarion call to begin the millennium with an \"Environment Decade.\" It is time to reflect deeply on the fate of our planet and commit ourselves to its future.",

The players leave. The teams leave. The whole sport goes out on strike. And the ticket prices go up. Again. The only thing that's left is the uniforms - if the marketing geniuses haven't changed those too.Now nationally known columnist and sportswriter Mike Lupica gives vent to the anger that has permeated so much of contemporary sports discussion, delivering a broadside that not only lays out where we are, but investigates how we got there. Step by step, he explores how the players, the owners, the agents, the commissioners, even his own media, brought us to this state - and then proposes some revolutionary ideas of his own about how fans, individually and together, can make the whole runaway industry sit up and take notice.",

Rose is amazed that her occupation as an aroma-therapist is causing such consternation among the townsfolk, when what else goes on within the village limits seems so much worse: there's a housewife who's a hooker, a sex-starved neighbor and a troublesome Peeping Tom. Beneath the all-pervasive aroma of garden lavender there's a distinct scent of scandal here, and Rose thinks that her small transgressions seem paltry in comparison -- until she starts to get intimately involved with the sexy local builder ... and her ex-lover arrives out of nowhere with a shocking announcement ... and she unwittingly finds herself in the center of a chaotic, rumor-fed hurricane of scandal that ensures her life is even more complicated than it was before.

Clear black and white illustrations as well as an exquisite four-color photographic insert, bring this exciting world vividly to life. In addition, a selection of appendices cover everything from birding organizations to birding publications.The most important qualification for birdwatching is a desire to do it--and BIRDING FOR BEGINNERS is just the guide to help make that desire a pleasurable reality.",
