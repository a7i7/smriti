        "Authors": "By Linklater, Andro",
        "Description": "With the same mix of compelling narrative history and captivating historical argument that made his previous book, Measuring America, such a success, Andro Linklater relates in fascinating detail how, the borders and boundaries that formed states and a nation inspired the sense of identity that has have ever since been central to the American experiment.Linklater opens with America's greatest surveyor, Andrew Ellicott, measuring the contentious boundary between Pennsylvania and Virginia in the summer of 1784; and he ends standing at the yellow line dividing the United States and Mexico at Tijuana. In between, he chronicles the evolving shape of the nation, physically and psychologically. As Americans pushed westward in the course of the nineteenth century, the borders and boundaries established by surveyors like Ellicott created property, uniting people in a desire for the government and laws that would protect it. Challenging Frederick Jackson Turner's famed frontier thesis, Linklater argues that we are , thus, defined not by open spaces but by boundaries. \"What Americanized the immigrants was not the frontier experience\" Linklater writes, \"but the fact that it took place inside the United States frontier.\" Those same borders had the ability to divide as well as unite, as the great battle over internal boundaries during the Civil War would show. By century's end, however, we were spreading U.S. power beyond our borders, an act that, seen through Linklater's eyes, offers an intriguing perspective on our role in the world today.Linklater's great achievement is to weave these provocative arguments into a dramatic storyline, wherein the actions of Ellicott, Thomas Jefferson, the treasonous general James Wilkinson, Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, and numerous hitherto invisible settlers, all illuminate the shaping of the nation. This brilliant book will alter forever readers' perception of America and what it means to be an American.",

        "Authors": "By Lutzer, Erwin W.",
        "Description": "YOU CAN START OVER AGAIN Many Christians become so discouraged because of their sins and failures that they give up on ever having fellowship with God again. They also fear that their broken relationships will never heal. For everyone who has wished for a fresh beginning, here is good news. This gentle, affirming book emphasises how much God wants his wandering children to return to him. Award-winning author and pastor Erwin Lutzer provides solutions to common questions about how to reconnect with God and with those we are estranged from. Thanks to God\u2019s grace, it is never too late to do what\u2019s right.  In this powerful, practical book, bestselling author Erwin Lutzer shows you how to clear your conscience and reestablish broken relationships. Worthy or not, you can know real, lasting peace - and the assurance that God still has a plan for your life.Story Behind the BookThe idea for this book came to me when speaking at Promise Keepers. There were many men who came to faith in Christ, but then failed in their walk the next week or the next month. So they assumed that this new life was not for them; they thought that God was so angry with their failure, they might just as well live on the fringes of the Christian faith, rather than making it the core of their lives. This is a message of grace, not only in establishing our relationship with God, but in reconciling with those we have wronged, or who have wronged us.",

This is no simple cat-and-mouse story, but a nonstop thriller in which you'll never guess who's the cat and who's the mouse until the shattering conclusion.J. D. Cade was trained to kill by his country. To kill without leaving the slightest suspicion as to who pulled the trigger. He did his duty and put the past behind him. Or so he thought. Now someone is blackmailing him to use his deadly skills one more time. Someone is using his only son as a pawn to force him to do what he swore he'd never do again: kill a human being. And this time the target is Franklin Delano Rawley-the first African-American on the verge of becoming the president of the United States. As J. D. penetrates the inner circle of the Rawley campaign and gets to know the man he must kill, the more he realizes how difficult it will be to pull the trigger. But in order to spare Rawley's life while saving his own son, J. D. must somehow find out who is behind the conspiracy that could change the fate of a nation. It won't be easy. J. D.'s every move is being watched by his blackmailer. He has already drawn the attention of a suspicious Secret Service agent. And he has met an old army \"friend\" working in the Rawley campaign. Just as troubling is J. D.'s attraction to Rawley's beautiful campaign manager. If J. D. does have to kill the candidate, he will have to betray her, too.Time is running out. When J. D. finally pulls the trigger, who will live and who will die? Rawley? J. D.'s son? Or J. D. himself? And who will be the next president? You won't find out until the explosive conclusion of Joseph Flynn's totally unique thriller, one that defies you to guess the answers.",

        "Description": "An absorbing example of political journalism, The Nixon Memo is a case study of Richard Nixon's relentless quest for political rehabilitation. At issue is the key role of this former president of the United States (best known for his involvement in the famous \"watergate\" scandal) in the post-cold war debate about aiding Russia in its uncertain revolution.The story begins on March 10, 1992. Nixon had written a private memo critical of president George Bush's policy toward Russia. The memo leaked and exploded on the front page of The New York Times. Why would Nixon attack Bush, a fellow party member fighting for re-election? Why on an issue of foreign affairs, which was Bush's strength? The questions are as intriguing as the answers, and distinguished journalist and scholar Marvin Kalb offers a suspenseful, eye-opening account of how our conventional wisdom on United States foreign policy is shaped by the insider's game of press/politics.This story of Nixon's Machiavellian efforts to pressure the White House, by way of the press, into helping Boris Yeltsin and Russia sheds new light on the inner workings of the world inside the government of the United States. Marvin Kalb read the documents behind the Nixon memo and interviewed scores of journalists, scholars, and officials in and from Washington and Moscow. Drawing on his years of experience as a diplomatic correspondent, he identifies and illuminates the intersection of press and politics in the fashioning of public policy.\"An absorbing and often compelling argument that Richard Nixon directed his own political rehabilitation on the world stage, using presidents, lesser politicians, and the press as his supporting cast. This is a first-class job of unraveling a complex and usually unseen tapestry.\"--Ted Koppel\"With Marvin Kalb's captivating account, Richard Nixon continues to fascinate us even in death.\"--Al Hunt",

        "Description": "\u201cSince the first navy frogmen crawled onto the beaches of Normandy, no SEAL has ever surrendered,\u201d writes Chuck Pfarrer. \u201cNo SEAL has ever been captured, and not one teammate or body has ever been left in the field. This  legacy of valor is unmatched in modern warfare.\u201dWarrior Soul is a book about the warrior spirit, and it takes the reader all over the world. Former Navy SEAL Chuck Pfarrer recounts some of his most dangerous assignments: On a clandestine reconnaissance mission on the Mosquito Coast, his recon team plays a deadly game of cat and mouse with a Nicaraguan patrol boat. Cut off on the streets of Beirut, the author\u2019s SEAL detachment must battle snipers on the Green Line. In the mid-Atlantic, Pfarrer\u2019s unit attempts to retrieve\u2014or destroy\u2014the booster section of a Trident ballistic missile before it can be recovered by a Russian spy trawler. On a runway in Sicily, his assault element surrounds an Egyptian airliner carrying the Achille Lauro hijackers.These are only a few of the riveting stories of combat patrol, reconnaissance missions, counter-terrorist operations, tragedies, and victories in Warrior Soul that illustrate the SEAL maxim \u201cThe person who will not be defeated cannot be defeated.\u201d",

        "Authors": "By Cathcart, Thomas and Klein, Daniel",
        "Description": "Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein, authors of the national bestseller Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar, aren\u2019t falling for any election year claptrap\u2014and they don\u2019t want their readers to either! In Aristotle and an Aardvark Go to Washington, our two favorite philosopher-comedians return just in time to save us from the double-speak, flim-flam, and alternate reality of politics in America. Deploying jokes and cartoon as well as the occasional insight from Aristotle and his peers, Cathcart and Klein explain what politicos are up to when they state: \u201cThe absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.\u201d (Donald Rumsfeld), \u201cIt depends on what the meaning of the word \u2018is\u2019 is.\u201d (Bill Clinton), or even, \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident\u2026\u201d (Thomas Jefferson, et al). Drawing from the pronouncements of everyone from Caesar to Condoleeza Rice, Genghis Kahn to Hillary Clinton, and Adolf Hitler to Al Sharpton. Cathcart and Klein help us learn to identify tricks such as \u201cThe Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy\u201d (non causa pro causa) and the \u201cThe Fallacy Fallacy\u201d (argumentum and logicam). Aristotle and an Aardvark is for anyone who ever felt like the politicos and pundits were speaking Greek. At least Cathcart and Klein provide the Latin name for it (raudatio publica)!",

But I've had my share of struggles over the years, and I know a thing or two about what has worked for me. I have chosen to be an active participant in my life rather than a spectator, and in so doing I have chosen how to be a woman, how to be a wife, and how to be a mother in ways that are uniquely my own. I offer the stories of these choices as evidence of the power of sheer determination, will, and faith in God.You've seen her on television with her husband, Dr. Phil.

In Inside My Heart, Robin speaks woman to woman, inspiring you to embrace and celebrate the many roles you play and encouraging you to make deliberate choices that lead to a richer, happier, and more meaningful life. She shares with you the life-changing moments of her childhood years, dating and marrying Dr. Phil McGraw, raising two sons, and asserting herself as a woman in a man's world to show you that you have the power to make choices in your life. In fact, she's convinced that you must choose to go after the life you want.With a deep and abiding faith in God, Robin McGraw shares her story so you too can make choices that reflect your own heart's truest priorities and highest goals.",
