Kirk braves the perils of the Badlands to confront a Romulan Bird of Prey that has entered Federation space in pursuit of a fleeing smuggler. But trespassing Romulans may be the least of Kirk's problems when the mysterious forces at work in the Badlands threaten both his ship and his crew!  A generation later, Jean-Luc Picard faces the same phantom menace when he commands his Enterprise into the Badlands on a mission vital to Federation-Cardassian relations.

In the most candid and outrageous look at Wall Street since Liar's Poker, Cramer, co-founder of TheStreet.com, radio and television commentator, and for years a premier money manager, takes readers on the wild ride that is Wall Street -- revealing how the game is played, who breaks the rules, and who gets hurt. Confessions of a Street Addict takes us from Cramer's roots in the middle-class Philadelphia suburbs to Harvard, where he began managing money, and then to Goldman Sachs, where he went into business with his wife -- Karen, the \"Trading Goddess\" -- as his partner. He brilliantly describes the life of a money manager: the frenetic pace, the constant pressure to outperform the market and other fund managers, and the sharklike attacks fund managers make as they circle a fund perceived to be in trouble. Throughout the book Cramer is characteristically outspoken, offering his hard-won insights about the market and everyone in it, himself included. There has never been a more eloquent market insider than Cramer, nor a more high-octane book about Wall Street.",

        "Description": "As a child, Elias Chacour lived in a small Palestinian village in Galilee. The townspeople were proud of their ancient Christian heritage and lived at peace with their Jewish neighbors. But early in 1947, their idyllic lifestyle was swept away as tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed and nearly one million forced into refugee camps.  An exile in his native land, Elias began a years-long struggle with his love for the Jewish people and the world's misunderstanding of his own people, the Palestinians. How was he to respond? He found his answer in the simple, haunting words of the Man of Galilee: \"Blessed are the peacemakers.\"  In Blood Brothers, Chacour blends his riveting life story with historical research to reveal a little-known side of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the birth of modern Israel. He touches on controversial questions such as \"What behind-the-scenes politics touched off the turmoil in the Middle East?\", \"What does Bible prophecy really have to say?\", and \"Can bitter enemies ever be reconciled?\" Originally published by Chosen Books in 1984 and now expanded with a new introduction by the author, a new foreword by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, and a \"Since Then\" epilogue by writer David Hazard, this compelling book offers readers hope-filled insight into living at peace in the most volatile region of the world.",

Now, in Gone for Soldiers, Jeff Shaara carries us back fifteen years before that momentous conflict, when the Civil War's most familiar names are fighting for another cause, junior officers marching under the same flag in an unfamiliar land, experiencing combat for the first time in the Mexican-American War.In March 1847, the U.S. Navy delivers eight thousand soldiers on the beaches of Vera Cruz. They are led by the army's commanding general, Winfield Scott, a heroic veteran of the War of 1812, short tempered, vain, and nostalgic for the glories of his youth. At his right hand is Robert E. Lee, a forty-year-old engineer, a dignified, serious man who has never seen combat.Scott leads his troops against the imperious Mexican dictator, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. Obsessed with glory and his place in history, Santa Ana arrogantly underestimates the will and the heart of Scott and his army. As the Americans fight their way inland, both sides understand that the inevitable final conflict will come at the gates and fortified walls of the ancient capital, Mexico City.Cut off from communication and their only supply line, the Americans learn about their enemy and themselves, as young men witness for the first time the horror of war. While Scott must weigh his own place in history, fighting what many consider a bully's war, Lee the engineer becomes Lee the hero, the one man in Scott's command whose extraordinary destiny as a soldier is clear.In vivid, brilliant prose that illuminates the dark psychology of soldiers and their commanders trapped behind enemy lines, Jeff Shaara brings to life the haunted personalities and magnificent backdrop, the familiar characters, the stunning triumphs and soul-crushing defeats of this fascinating, long-forgotten war. Gone for Soldiers is an extraordinary achievement that will remain with you long after the final page is turned.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Description": "Over the past century, America's Eagle Scouts have earned a reputation for service, virtue, and leadership that is recognized throughout the world. But few people realize the full extent to which Eagle Scouts have made a mark on American history. They have served as astronauts, soldiers, politicians, and businessmen, but they have also been the fathers, brothers, Scoutmasters, coaches, and other role models who have played an integral part in American life. Alvin Townley set out across the country to hear the stories of these Eagle Scouts. He spoke with individuals from every region, of every age and every background, some of whom have risen to fame as public figures while others have left a lasting impact outside of the spotlight. The Eagle Scouts who share their experiences include Bill Gates, Sr., Bill Bradley, J. W. Marriott, Jr., Ross Perot, Michael Bloomberg, Richard Lugar, Michael Dukakis, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, coach Chan Gailey, and Capt. Jim Lovell of Apollo 13. The book also explores the virtues of a Tuskegee Airman, a Vietnam War POW, a September 11 NYPD hero, a crew of Hurricane Katrina relief workers, and a host of others from every walk of life. During his journey, Alvin discovered stories of character, courage, and inspiration that belong not only to Eagle Scouts but to all Americans. These stories form the heart of Legacy of Honor and offer us a chance to appreciate the profound impact that Eagle Scouts have had on American history and the lasting role they will play in our country's future.",

Of even more concern are two interwoven German operations. The first is a government scheme for Jews outside the Fatherland to purchase the freedom of their relatives in concentration camps, who will then be transported to Argentina and Uruguay. The second has to do with where that money is going: a plan called Operation Phoenix, which will establish safe havens for senior Nazi officials in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. Needless to say, the OSS is very interested in both of them, and if Frade can somehow find out a little more ... without getting killed, that is.

        "Title": "Getting into Guinness: One Man's Longest, Fastest, Highest Journey Inside the World's Most Famous Record Book",
        "Authors": "By Olmstead, Larry",
        "Description": "A fascinating mix of participatory journalism and history, Getting Into Guinness is the never-before-told story of the bestselling copyrighted book of all time. Veteran reporter Larry Olmsted began a personal quest to break an existing world record, then to set another one, and soon he was fully immersed in the crazy and highly competitive world of record breaking. This is his behind-the-scenes report of the characters who created the famous record book and continue to make it wackier and wackier with every passing year. The enthralling 50-year history of the Guinness World Records is a story of phenomenal success, equally compelling failures, and extreme oddities. People all over the world strive to get into the book, often in the most unbelievable ways. Olmsted chronicles some of the funniest and most interesting Guinness record holders from a uniquely insider perspective: he himself is one of them. It all began with a gentleman's wager over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the grouse. The attempt to answer this question has sold more than 100 million books in dozens of languages and every corner of the globe. Today, there is heated competition for the record to hold the most records (currently held by Ashrita Furman, 114 records and counting), as well as classic curiosities that have lasted for decades (the tallest man in history is still Robert Wadlow, at 8' 11\"). Interwoven into all of this is Olmsted's account of his own two successful record-setting attempts, the first involving traveling halfway around the world with his golf shoes\u2014\"Greatest Distance Between Two Rounds of Golf on the Same Day\"\u2014and the second causing him to nearly lose his mind while playing the world's longest poker session.Why do people devote so much energy to get into the record book, often at great risk? Why do the most extreme fans devote their entire lives to this pursuit? Why is society so obsessed with records and record breaking? Why do Americans alone buy a million and a half copies of the famous book every year, propelling it to the top of the bestseller lists decade after decade? Why do readers of all generations remember the same record-holding icons, the fattest twins, the longest fingernails, and the tallest man? After his own journey inside the world of record breaking, these are the questions Olmsted attempts to answer.In the tradition of the bestselling Word Freak\u2014a m\u00e9lange of travelogue, memoir, investigative journalism, and history\u2014Getting Into Guinness is a must-read for anyone who has ever read Guinness World Records and wondered why someone would grow their fingernails for an entire lifetime.",

        "Authors": "By Millman, Chad and Papale, Vince",
        "Description": "The true story of the NFL's oldest rookie In 1976, Vince Papale was thirty, a former schoolteacher and part-time bartender, and a season ticket-holder for his beloved Philadelphia Eagles. When he heard that Coach Dick Vermeil was holding open tryouts, he decided to give it a shot. Shocking himself and the coaches, he ran an explosive 40-yard-dash in just 4.5 seconds--a world-class time--and was offered a contract on the spot. When he joined the team, Papale became the oldest non-kicking rookie in NFL history, a fan favorite who played for four years and was named a team captain. Invincible is Vince Papale's story, and a tie-in to the Disney Pictures film of the same name starring Mark Wahlberg as Papale and Greg Kinnear as Vermeil. But more than just a tie-in, it tells Papale's story in his own words, covering subjects not included in the film. Like Rudy, Glory Road, and Rookie, it is the true story of an ordinary man who achieves an extraordinary goal.",

Exported from the United States and still controlled by it, the game is also a crucial arena of intercultural relations. Sugarball describes how Dominican baseball fosters national pride and competition with the United States while at the same time promoting acceptance of the North American presence in the country.\u00a0Alan M. Klein traces the introduction and development of baseball in the Dominican Republic, provides lively sketches of fans, stadiums, and players, and discusses such issues as the origin of the Dominican baseball academies and the growing international competition for Dominican players. Throughout, he evokes the wild enthusiasm that Dominicans have for the game and shows how it mirrors the conflict they feel between allowing and resisting American hegemony in their country. Klein relates the efforts of major league teams to seek talent in the Dominican Republic and shape the game to suit their own purposes?efforts that resemble other exploitative enterprises in the third world. These activities evoke little resentment, because for many Dominican young men baseball is the only way out of a life of unemployment or of hard labor in cities or cane fields. At the same time, their prowess at baseball encourages the Dominicans to oppose further interference from the Americans: having produced more major league baseball players than any other country apart from the Untied States, they feel they can make certain claims for the game as their own.",

Now, he's joining NAL with one of the most exciting books he's published in years-Power Aging. Cutting-edge science is proving in clinical trials for the first time that antioxidants, like vitamin C and beta-carotene, as well as lesser-known substances such as trimethylglycine, can effectively fight the symptoms of aging. We stand at the brink of a new paradigm that will change the very meaning of growing old.  Gary Null's Power Aging is a practical guide that anyone in their 40s, 50s, and beyond can use to live a longer, healthier life.  Part I explains how our modern environment, as well as our own biological processes, contribute to aging.  Part II looks at hormonal keys to health, and shows how they can address specific concerns- from maintaining cardiovascular function, facing the specter of cancer, and staying mentally sharp.  Part III puts it all together in a practical way, including a new diet and exercise program.",

The American people are looking for real answers; the next president must mobilize our government and our citizens in ways that no president has done since FDR. America needs the power of progress . . . once again.At the turn of the twentieth century, the American Dream was beginning to dim in a nation riven by growing inequalities in wealth and run by a powerful network of privileged industrialists and their political allies. But that era also gave birth to a renaissance in American political thought that forever changed our nation.At a time when conservative ideology served as an excuse for the accumulation of wealth and privilege, the original Progressive movement created a new political order built on America\u2019s basic principles\u2014justice and equality for all, economic opportunity, and a commitment to the common good.The lives of all Americans have been profoundly improved by the achievements of progressive reformers, from the eight-hour workday and voting rights to our victory in the Cold War and the economic gains middle-class Americans enjoyed under our most recent progressive president, Bill Clinton. Today\u2019s challenges demand a second great Progressive era. America needs an economy in which workers at every income level share in our riches; a climate policy that stops global warming and ends our addiction to fossil fuels; and American leadership in the global fight against terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and poverty.In The Power of Progress, John Podesta\u2014former Clinton chief of staff\u2014along with his colleague, John Halpin, explains how progressive values changed America in the wake of the Gilded Age and how these values will reshape America after the Bush presidency. Tapping the spirit of great progressive leaders from Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt to Martin Luther King Jr., The Power of Progress provides the road map toward a government responsive to the needs of its citizens; one that is focused on our generation\u2019s greatest challenges: combating global warming, growing our economy and expanding the middle class, and meeting America\u2019s twenty-first-century security challenges.",

        "Title": "Stirring of Soul in the Workplace",
        "Authors": "By Briskin, Alan",
        "Description": "This deeply lyrical book offers perspective for those struggling to hear the quiet voice of the soul over the din of the contemporary workplace. Alan Briskin shows how the modern organization has gradually increased its demands on us-beginning with our bodies, then our minds, and now our souls. But through the moving personal stories of people fighting to reclaim their souls, he also sends a message that encourages individuals to keep their spiritual integrity and values alive. In The Stirring of Soul In the Workplace, Briskin weaves together lessons from history, psychology, and management theory, with numerous real-life examples, to tell the story of how the modern workplace has evolved to value technology and productivity over soulfulness and relationship. From the Industrial Revolution&apos;s marriage of mechanization and efficiency to the management theories of the early 20th century, Briskin traces the emergence of the quest for efficiency and control in the workplace. He questions the corporate concept of \"individual personality\" that asks us to check our emotions, fantasies, imaginations, and souls at the door. He describes the history of the soul as a dynamic force that continues to influence our behavior, and shows how excluding it from our work life actually flattens our potential and dampens our creativity. Rather than solve the conventional question organizations have been asking for years-how can we change people?-Alan Briskin examines how organizations can better reflect personal and human values in the workplace. For organizations that too often have sacrificed the well-being of the individual for the goals of the organization, the author suggests a more active way of taking up our work roles that can bring more of our experience and imagination into play. He points out that meaning cannot come from corporate mission statements or reengineering programs. Instead, it needs to be nurtured through dialogue and reflection, the courage to ask troubling questions, and a willingness to face the consequences of our collective and individual actions. When we learn to honor the contradictions, uncertainties, and interconnections inherent in the workplace, the energies of the soul will begin to stir with revitalizing results.",

Communities In Schools (CIS) reaches more than one million at-risk students and their families annually in more than 3,000 American schools. These kids would fall far below the national average for every measure of student success. Yet 98 percent of CIS-tracked students stayed in school. Why? What makes the difference? The Last Dropout offers nine key principles that Communities In Schools has tested over three decades. Interwoven are the dramatic life stories of CIS founder Bill Milliken and his colleagues, a journey that began in the turbulent 1960s as youth workers with a spiritual mission struggled to turn around the lives of dropouts and addicts. It traces the evolution of the CIS movement from a handful of groundbreaking \"street academies\" to a national network of hundreds of local affiliates. The Last Dropout also features stories about how CIS leaders have adopted these principles in their own communities, with stunning results!",

        "Description": "Murder stalks the campus in this exciting, witty, fast-paced, and extremely atmospheric novel, the third Ivy League Mystery  by critically acclaimed writer Pamela Thomas-Graham.  Harvard economics professor Nikki Chase has come to Princeton for the weekend, primarily to take part in a conference on world economy, but also to pay a quick visit to her younger brother, a graduate student there, and to attend a party honoring Princeton professor Earl Stokes, an old friend and mentor who is rumored to be considering giving up his dual responsibilities as head of  Afro-Am Studies and professor in the Economics Department  and to make a move to Harvard.  Nikki is no stranger to the political games that are played among the professorial ranks, both intermurally and intramurally, so she is not surprised that she finds Professor Stokes under attack both from those who don't want him to leave Princeton and from those who definitely do not want to see him at Harvard. Stokes, after all, hasn't just risen in the ranks; he has become a star thanks to his recent controversial bestselling book, Color Counts.  So when Stokes's body is found in the smoldering ruins of the new Afro-Am Studies building, which was still under construction, Nikki is reluctant to accept the findings of the Princeton police that his death was an accident. There remain too many unanswered questions and, as Nikki is acutely aware, there are too many people who had a lot to gain from Earl Stokes's death.  Soon, despite warnings from his friends, her own department head, and the Princeton police, Nikki Chase has begun her own investigation into her mentor's death, abetted by a Princeton debutante and a wealthy alumna. What she uncovers threatens to cause a major upheaval, not only on the Princeton campus, but back at Harvard as well.  Smart and sassy and sexy, Orange Crushed is a thoroughly engaging page-turner that will appeal to all fans of mystery, with a distinctive and entertaining heroine readers will adore.",

Sometimes the memories return in a dream: She and her mother are climbing the stairs, following her dripping-wet sister through the bedroom to a door. The door leads to the upstairs bathroom, but when Heather opens it they are standing in a marble chamber on the edge of a glassy lake. Ismay watches as a white thing floats toward them, its face submerged, and her mother calls, absurdly, \"Don't look!\" But of course she does. She looks into the water and sees her stepfather Guys face, his lifeless, frightened eyes, staring up at her.Now, nine years after Guy was found dead in the bathtub, she and Heather still live in their childhood home, which has since been renovated into two flats, one upstairs for their mother and aunt, with Heather and Ismay downstairs. The police determined the cause of death was an accident, and to this day the two sisters never talk about what happened.Although Ismay finds herself feeling intensely protective of her little sister and of the secret they share, their lives move placidly, even happily, forward. It seems as if the mysterious death of their stepfather is behind them. But when Headier becomes seriously involved with a man for the first time, Ismay's long-repressed memories can no longer be ignored. With painful inevitability, the surprising truth will emerge whether Ismay wants it to or not.",

        "Authors": "By Bahn, Paul G. (EDT)",
        "Description": "We humans have always possessed a deep curiosity about our origins and past.  Indeed, as far back as 600 B.C. a Babylonian king excavated a temple floor laid 3,200 years before his time.  Archaeology, to paraphrase Colin Renfrew, is a history of self-discovery, and for that reason it holds attraction for all peoples and all cultures.    The Cambridge Illustrated History of Archaeology exploits our fascination with our past. It tells the story of those explorations that have helped shape our knowledge of history--from early digging in Greece and the Near East through the unearthing of sites in Europe to the archaeological finds of the Americas, Africa, and Australasia.  It chronicles the development of archaeology from the crude fumblings of early antiquaries to the sophisticated digs of the present day. The team of experts under the guidance of Paul Bahn attempts to strike a balance between spectacular discoveries, such as the tomb of Tutankhamen, and the equally important progress of ideas. At the same time, they describe the often colorful roles of leading characters and set them against the social background of their times.  It is hoped that many present and future general readers and amateur archaeologists will uncover much of interest in this book.   Paul Bahn is the author of many books about archaeology, including The Bluffer's Guide to Archaeology (1989) and Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice (with Colin Renfrew, 1991).",

        "Description": "To Everything There is a Season is a joyous and sometimes light-hearted account of a psychotherapist and her creation of a woodland garden which slowly evolved into a spiritual place of growth for the soul. The author shares her hands-on experience of planning, planting and nurturing a garden of beauty and serenity. The result is a celebration of the joys of being at one with the earth. With sensitivity and warmth, Alice Miller shows us how to make it all happen as she moves with ease from horticulture to humor to spirituality. This is a story about garden paths \u2014 themselves a metaphor for life. The book begins with the gardens of youth and then moves on to the creation of a real woodland garden and the author's subsequent spiritual journey. These garden paths serve as a vehicle for guiding the reader through the growing process, both literally and metaphorically. The story is told not in the abstract but rather in a personal and self-disclosing narrative. At the core of this book is a strong Judeo-Christian perspective. This view may not, however, always qualify as spiritual in the \"traditional\" sense. This perspective is more like life itself, as the author shares both amusing as well as profound experiences. Her humor is firmly grounded, however, in substantial and universal beliefs. Threaded through the later chapters are themes of laughter, prayer, grace and faith. The author also addresses her increasing awareness that our earthly environment must be considered as more than a \"gift,\" but also as a sacred trust to be preserved for future generations. It is the author's intention that at the close of this book, readers will find themselves wanting to follow the path of their own garden journey. For, clearly, the message of this book is that there is a garden within each of us, simply waiting to happen.",

Crystal nodded, dazed, knowing somehow that if he had proposed a trip to Mars she would have been helpless to refuse. She had come to Virginia to work, not to fall in love -- certainly not with someone like Kip Montrose. Both Kip and his ancestral mansion, Montclair, had captured her imagination. The history of the house intrigued her as much as its master. Even ten years after the end of WWI, the families of Mayfield, VA, still feel its destructive effects. With his days as a dare-devil flying ace behind him, Kip Montrose is having a hard time settling down in the small Southern town and finding a new direction for his life. At the same time, the twins, Cara and Kitty Cameron, are also trying to rebuild their lives shadowed by loss. Then, the arrival of Crystal Kirk, an attractive young career woman, to rent Eden Cottage, and the return of Garnet with Bryane, and her English companion, Jill, sparks excitement, romance, as well as unexpected problems. The era of the Roaring Twenties brings new challenges to the younger members of the Montrose and Cameron clans, as they search for new purpose for their lives, face their inherited destiny, and hope for lasting love. Suddenly, a senatorial campaign tears the families apart and plunges old friends into a bitter political battle in which both winners and losers attain unexpected results.",

Iraq sits on the world's largest supply of oil, and with the world's energy requirements continuously rising, Iraq will play an ongoing role in the global economy and the political environment throughout the Gulf region and the Middle East.Polk's concise, authoritative overview of Iraq's history shows how the pattern of outside intervention was established first by the Ottoman Turks and the Persian Safavids and later by England, Russia, and Germany. After World War I came British rule, followed by a brief and uneasy period of independence that sparked Iraqi nationalism, leading Saddam Husain to power with American military and financial aid and covert CIA involvement. The Iraq-Iran War and the invasion of Kuwait was followed by the Gulf War, the sanctions period, and the Bush administration's decision to invade. Finally, there is the American occupation and the challenges, opportunities, and options that Iraqis and Americans face now and in the future.",

        "Description": "In the spellbinding tradition of Minette Walters and Ruth Rendell, author Julia Wallis Martin crafts an intelligent, atmospheric British suspense novel as engrossing as it is original.An entire house, long submerged in the dark waters of a reservoir, unearths a starting find: the corpse of Helena Warner, an Oxford college student who disappeared twenty years earlier. For former homicide detective Bill Driver, it means the reopening of a case that, in his mind, was never really closed. And Driver thinks he knows who did it. But three of Helena's friends-- her cold former lover Ian Gilmore, her jealous best friend Joan Poole, and talented but institutionalized artist Richard Wachmann-- conspire to keep a decades-old, deadly secret from seeing the light of day...all the while, a killer continues to strike again and again.",
