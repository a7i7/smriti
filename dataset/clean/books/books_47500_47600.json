        "Description": "The bestselling author of The Devil Wears Prada and Everyone Worth Knowing returns with the story of three best friends who vow to change their entire lives...and change them fast.Emmy is newly single, and not by choice. She was this close to the ring and the baby she's wanted her whole life when her boyfriend left her for his twenty-three-year-old personal trainer -- whose fees are paid by Emmy. With her plans for the perfect white wedding in the trash, Emmy is now ordering takeout for one. Her friends insist an around-the-world sex-fueled adventure will solve all her problems -- could they be right?Leigh, a young star in the publishing business, is within striking distance of landing her dream job as senior editor and marrying her dream guy. And to top it all off, she has just purchased her dream apartment. Only when Leigh begins to edit the enfant terrible of the literary world, the brilliant and brooding Jesse Chapman, does she start to notice some cracks in her perfect life...Adriana is the drop-dead-gorgeous daughter of a famous supermodel. She possesses the kind of feminine wiles made only in Brazil, and she never hesitates to use them. But she's about to turn thirty and -- as her mother keeps reminding her -- she won't have her pick of the men forever. Everyone knows beauty is ephemeral and there's always someone younger and prettier right around the corner. Suddenly she's wondering...does Mother know best?These three very different girls have been best friends for a decade in the greatest city on earth. As they near thirty, they're looking toward their future...but despite all they've earned -- first-class travel, career promotions, invites to all the right parties, and luxuries small and large -- they're not quite sure they like what they see...One Saturday night at the Waverly Inn, Adriana and Emmy make a pact: within a single year, each will drastically change her life. Leigh watches from the sidelines, not making any promises, but she'll soon discover she has the most to lose. Their friendship is forever, but everything else is on the table. Three best friends. Two resolutions. One year to pull it off.",

They categorize knowledge work into four sequential activities--accessing, generating, embedding, and transferring--and look at the key skills, techniques, and processes of each. While they present a practical approach to cataloging and storing knowledge so that employees can easily leverage it throughout the firm, the authors caution readers on the limits of communications and information technology in managing intellectual capital.",

After all, low cholesterol and a flat stomach won't get you very far if back or neck problems, or a worn out knee or shoulder, keep tripping you up.This first-of-its-kind program is designed to ensure that your frame can go the distance, with durability to match the muscle tone and conditioning we all want. And unlike other workouts, Framework starts with a unique self-test that uncovers potential problems with your frame, your workout, your nutrition, and more. It even combines diet and lifestyle advice with a balanced, customizable workout that acknowledges the fact that our bodies are all a little different and often need special attention. It teaches you to pay attention to what your body tries to tell you, and when it is being challenged by a special problem, whether it is a heel spur or stress on the job.Best of all, Nicholas A. DiNubile, M.D., who serves as orthopedic consultant for the Philadelphia 76ers as well as the Pennsylvania Ballet, shows you how to work around--helping without hurting--any muscle or joint problems you may already have. And it all takes only 1 hour a day, 3 days a week.",

        "Description": "Ambassador Ed Rowny holds a unique position in American history as a key arms control advisor and negotiator for presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush. No other policy-maker has ever negotiated for and counseled five presidents and their cabinets. Ambassador Rowny's revealing memoirs contain startling and sometimes amusing anecdotes about Henry Kissinger, Jim Baker, Amy Carter, drunken Soviet negotiators, Ronald Reagan, Leonid Brezhnev, Mikhail Gorbachev, and many other U.S. and world figures. It Takes One to Tango highlights what took place behind closed doors and is highly critical of George Bush's presidency.By the man who helped negotiate and then sink SALT II, this outspoken account of events at the highest government levels is a wry inside look at five U.S. administrations and a barbed commentary on the major players in the foreign policy and national security arenas. This is the book that tells you what it's like to sit at the conference table with presidents, how Brezhnev and Gorbachev behaved, what Ronald Reagan said about Raisa Gorbachev - and which emperors had no clothes. Ambassador Rowny provides an unprecedented look at world leaders, the Washington elite, and negotiating about life and death.",

The excruciatingly funny The Nature and Purpose of the Universe asks whether Eleanor Mann\u2019s Job-like suffering is really her fault, while Titanic takes us into the heart of children\u2019s anger with their parents and parents\u2019 manipula\u00adtion of their children. In Beyond Therapy, two horrifyingly human therapists pursue their own needs at the expense of the most mismatched couple ever to meet through a personal ad.Also including ?Dentity Crisis and The Actor\u2019s Nightmare, this collection demonstrates that laughter is the best surgery, slicing through prejudice and hypocrisy, cutting out dead beliefs and inflamed opinions. These dark comedies, lit by lightning bolts of truth and humor, are among the most illuminating in American drama, by ?one of the most explosively funny American dramatists\u201d (Newsweek).Includes:The Nature and Purpose of the Universe?Dentity CrisisTitanicThe Actor\u2019s NightmareSister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for YouBeyond Therapy",

        "Title": "Burnham's Celestial Handbook: An Observer's Guide to the Universe Beyond the Solar System, Vol. 3",
        "Authors": "By Burnham, Robert",
        "Description": "Volume III of a comprehensive three-part\u00a0guide to\u00a0celestial objects outside our solar system concludes with listings from Pavo to Vulpecula. While there are many books on stars, there is only one Celestial Handbook. Now completely revised through 1977, this unique and necessary reference is available once again to guide amateur and advanced astronomers in their knowledge and enjoyment of the stars.After an extensive introduction in Volume I, which gives the beginner enough information to follow about 80 percent of the body of the material, the author gives comprehensive coverage to the thousands of celestial objects outside our solar system that are within the range of telescopes in the two- to twelve-inch range.The objects are grouped according to the constellations in which they appear. Each constellation is divided into four subject sections: list of double and multiple stars; list of variable stars; list of star clusters, nebulae and galaxies; and descriptive notes. For each object the author gives names, celestial coordinates, classification, and full physical description. These, together with a star atlas, will help you find and identify almost every object of interest.But the joy of the book is the descriptive notes that follow. They cover history, unusual movements or appearance, and currently accepted explanations of such visible phenomena as white dwarfs, novae and super novae, cepheids, mira-type variables, dark nebulae, gaseous nebulae, eclipsing binary stars, the large Magellanic cloud, the evolution of a star cluster, and hundreds of other topics, many of which are difficult to find in one place. Hundreds of charts and other visual aids are included to help in identification. Over 300 photographs capture the objects and are works of beauty that reflect the enthusiasm that star gazers have for their subject.Robert Burnham, Jr., who was on the staff of the Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona, conceived the idea of The Celestial Handbook decades ago, when he began assembling a notebook of all the major facts published about each celestial object. In its former, privately printed edition, this handbook was acclaimed as one of the most helpful books for astronomers on any level.",

        "Title": "Hannah's Gift: Lessons from a Life Fully Lived",
        "Authors": "By Housden, Maria",
        "Description": "Every once in a while a book comes along that can change your life\u2013a book so special, it is destined not just to be read but to be cherished, to be passed from one reader to another as a precious gift. Filled with wisdom and grace, tears and laughter, Hannah\u2019s Gift is one such book. Within these pages Maria Housden shares the transformative lessons in living she received from her three-year-old daughter Hannah, who brought courage, honesty, and joy to her struggle with cancer. During the last year of her short life, Hannah was fearless in the way she faced death\u2013and irrepressibly joyful in the way she approached living. The little girl who wore her favorite red Mary Janes into the operating room changed the life of everyone who came in contact with her. Now, in a book that preserves Hannah\u2019s indomitable spirit, Maria Housden offers the gift of her daughter\u2019s last year to all of us. In a lyrically told narrative, both moving and unforgettable, Housden recounts Hannah\u2019s battle with cancer in simple, straightforward language that transcends grief and fear to become a celebration. From Hannah\u2019s story emerge five profound lessons\u2013of truth, joy, faith, compassion, and wonder\u2013that have the power to change our lives. During her illness Hannah showed how we can truly live in the moment and break free from lives suffocated by too many unlived joys. Even more memorable is the message Hannah delivered after her death to those she loved\u2013a message of hope for anyone faced with the deepest questions of life and death.Hannah\u2019s Gift nourishes the soul with an ageless wisdom all the more invaluable for having come from someone so young. A remarkable story, remarkably told, it will bring comfort to anyone touched by loss, and renewed faith in the power of love.Closing her eyes and extending her arms, Hannah began to dance. Oblivious to everything but the shoes on her feet, she skipped and clicked across the floor, twirling in circles, faster and faster. There was something about her pure joy and the defiant nobility of the red shoes that caught everyone\u2019s attention....The true measure of a life is not its length but the fullness with which it is lived",

And our Philippine Islands? We are the small chickens.\u201dOnce in a great while comes a storyteller who can illuminate worlds large and small, magical and true to life. When the Elephants Dance\u00a0\u00a0 introduces us to the incandescent voice of Tess Uriza Holthe, who sets her remarkable first novel in the waning days of World War II, as the Japanese and the Americans engage in a fierce battle for possession of the Philippine Islands. The Karangalan family and their neighbors huddle for survival in the cellar of a house a few miles from Manila. Outside the safety of their little refuge the war rages on\u2014fiery bombs torch the beautiful Filipino countryside, Japanese soldiers round up and interrogate innocent people, and from the hills guerillas wage a desperate campaign against the enemy. Inside the cellar, these men, women, and children put their hopes and dreams on hold as they wait out the war, only emerging to look for food, water, and medicine.Through the eyes of three narrators, thirteen-year-old Alejandro Karangalan, his spirited older sister Isabelle, and Domingo, a passionate guerilla commander, we see how ordinary people must learn to live in the midst of extraordinary uncertainty, how they must find hope for survival where none seems to exist. They find this hope in the dramatic history of the Philippine Islands and the passion and bravery of its people. Crowded together in the cellar, the Karangalans and their friends and neighbors tell magical stories to one another based on Filipino myth and legend to fuel their courage, pass the time, and teach important lessons. The group is held spellbound by these stories, which feature a dazzling array of ghosts, witches, supernatural creatures, and courageous Filipinos who changed the course of history with their actions. These profoundly moving stories transport the listeners from the chaos of the war around them and give them new resolve to fight on.With When the Elephants Dance Holthe has not only written a gripping narrative of how Alejandro, Isabelle, Domingo and their community fight for survival, but a loving tribute to the magical realism that infuses Filipino culture. The stories shared by her characters are based on the same tales handed down to Holthe from her Filipino father and lola, her grandmother. This stunning debut novel is the first to celebrate in such richness and depth the spirit of the Filipino people and their fascinating story and marks the introduction of a talented new author who will join the ranks of writers such as Arundhati Roy, Manil Suri, and Amy Tan.",

Five years out of law school, with an apartment not much bigger than one of her beloved Prada shoe boxes and a burgeoning reputation as one of the city\u2019s fiercest litigators, Manny is an unabashed shopaholic who changes her hair color weekly, carries her poodle, Mycroft, everywhere, and whose idea of therapy is the preparation of an eight-course Italian meal. Dr. Jake Rosen is the deputy chief medical examiner of New York City, a confirmed workaholic and bachelor who lives alone in an oversized nineteenth-century Manhattan brownstone littered with morbid memorabilia and forensic artifacts, and who divides his life between the autopsy table and Chinese takeout. When a body is unearthed beneath the construction site of a mall near the Catskill Mountains, Jake is called to the scene by his elderly mentor, Dr. Pete Harrigan, to examine the bones.  Further investigation reveals a gruesome discovery: additional skeletal remains with striking abnormalities. After one of the victims is identified, the family of the deceased retains Manny to represent them, and, with Jake, she is swept into a terrifying vortex of murder and deceit, where a mounting body count hides both a shocking cover-up and a devastating love story.

The commercial world has rushed  headlong into doing business on the Web, often without integrating sound  security technologies and policies into their products and methods. The  security risks--and the need to protect both business and personal  data--have never been greater. We've updated Building Internet  Firewalls to address these newer risks.What kinds of security threats does the Internet pose? Some, like  password attacks and the exploiting of known security holes, have been  around since the early days of networking. And others, like the  distributed denial of service attacks that crippled Yahoo, E-Bay, and  other major e-commerce sites in early 2000, are in current headlines.Firewalls, critical components of today's computer networks,  effectively protect a system from most Internet security threats. They  keep damage on one part of the network--such as eavesdropping, a worm  program, or file damage--from spreading to the rest of the network.  Without firewalls, network security problems can rage out of control,  dragging more and more systems down.Like the bestselling and highly respected first edition, Building  Internet Firewalls, 2nd Edition, is a practical and detailed  step-by-step guide to designing and installing firewalls and configuring  Internet services to work with a firewall. Much expanded to include  Linux and Windows coverage, the second edition describes:Firewall technologies: packet filtering, proxying, network address  translation, virtual private networksArchitectures such as screening routers, dual-homed hosts, screened  hosts, screened subnets, perimeter networks, internal firewallsIssues involved in a variety of new Internet services and protocols  through a firewallEmail and News Web services and scripting languages (e.g., HTTP, Java, JavaScript,  ActiveX, RealAudio, RealVideo)File transfer and sharing services such as NFS, SambaRemote access services such as Telnet, the BSD \"r\" commands, SSH,  BackOrifice 2000 Real-time conferencing services such as ICQ and talk Naming and directory services (e.g., DNS, NetBT, the Windows Browser) Authentication and auditing services (e.g., PAM, Kerberos, RADIUS); Administrative services (e.g., syslog, SNMP, SMS, RIP and other  routing protocols, and ping and other network diagnostics) Intermediary protocols (e.g., RPC, SMB, CORBA, IIOP)Database protocols (e.g., ODBC, JDBC, and protocols for Oracle,  Sybase, and Microsoft SQL Server)The book's complete list of resources includes the location of many  publicly available firewall construction tools.",
