        "Description": "This supplement to accompany  Fundamentals of Physics, 6th Edition  provides hundreds of fresh problems to instructors for use in their classes. All begin with the basic key idea and then build step-by-step to a solution. Halliday (U. of Pittsburgh), Robert Resnick (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), and Jearl Walker (Cleveland State U.) also include a wide range of checkpoint-style, organizing, and discussion questions. Some of the problems involve applied physics, and certain chapters contain clustered problems that involve a common theme or technique, as well as tutorial problems, which demonstrate worked-out solutions and allow students to develop the thought process behind solving physics problems.

Nelson Searcy and Kerrick Thomas, founding pastors of The Journey Church in the heart of New York City, suggest that this failure is due to widely held beliefs about small groups that just aren\u2019t true\u2014and they aim to debunk the myths and set the record straight! Drawing from the startling success of small groups at The Journey Church (which has had over 100-percent participation in small groups for more than 4 years) Searcy and Thomas show how church leaders can implement a life-changing small-group ministry that gets the maximum number of people involved and solves many of the important (yet irritating) problems facing churches of all sizes.",

Still reeling from the tragedy, Ziele transferred to a police department north of New York, to escape the city and all the memories it conjured. But only a few months into his new life in a quiet country town, he's faced with the most shocking homicide of his career to date: Young Sarah Wingate has been brutally murdered in her own bedroom in the middle of an otherwise calm and quiet winter afternoon. After just one day of investigation, Simon's contacted by Columbia University's noted criminologist Alistair Sinclair, who offers a startling claim about one of his patients, Michael Fromley\u2014that the facts of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to Fromley's deranged mutterings.But what would have led Fromley, with his history of violent behavior and brutal fantasies, to seek out Sarah, a notable mathematics student and a proper young lady who has little in common with his previous targets? Is Fromley really a murderer, or is someone mimicking him?This is what Simon Ziele must find out, with the help of the brilliant but self-interested Alistair Sinclair\u2014before the killer strikes again.With this taut, atmospheric, and original story of a haunted man who must search for a killer while on the run from his own demons, Stefanie Pintoff's In the Shadow of Gotham marks the debut of an outstanding new talent, the inaugural winner of the Minotaur Books/Mystery Writers of America Best First Crime Novel Competition.In the Shadow of Gotham is the winner of the 2010 Edgar Award for Best First Novel.",

        "Description": "In this right-wing critique of American policy towards the Middle East, the author boldly declares at the outset that the \"enemy\" is \"Islam itself, as expressed by the life and teachings of Muhammad, as witnessed by the sociopolitical and religious movement that the Prophet unleashed against Judeo-Christian civilization, as upheld by contemporary Sunnis and Shi'ites around the world.\" Almost all of his criticisms of past and present US policy flow from this not particularly nuanced idea. Thus the blunders of US policy include the alleged failure of Jimmy Carter to adequately support the Shah of Iran when he was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution, the \"betrayal\" of Saddam Hussein as he fought his war with Iran, the waging of the first Gulf War to protect the Saudis, the ignoring of the possibility of nuclear materials falling into Muslim hands, the siding with Muslims during the Balkan wars, and the failure to crack down on immigrants.

Customized amenities provide homeowners comforts they couldn\u2019t afford otherwise and often more economical and environmentally smart ways. Think of luxury bathrooms with multilevel showers or oversized whirlpool tubs, skylights, staircases, ceramic tile and much, much more. Prefab Elements discusses this phenomenon, presenting scores of new materials and items that can be used either in a total prefab environment built from scratch or as individual items in a renovation or redesign. Building on the bestselling success of Prefab Modern, this inspiring book also provides a fascinating history of how the prefab movement really got started and how architects like Frank Lloyd Wright became increasingly involved with early prefab development. A source list and glossary are included to help homeowners get up to speed on this all the new exciting opportunities prefabricated elements offer today.",

Clarke\u2019s writing for decades. With Time\u2019s Eye and Sunstorm, the first two books in their acclaimed Time Odyssey series, Clarke and his brilliant co-author Stephen Baxter imagined a near-future in which the Firstborn seek to stop the advance of human civilization by employing a technology indistinguishable from magic.Their first act was the Discontinuity, in which Earth was carved into sections from different eras of history, restitched into a patchwork world, and renamed Mir. Mir\u2019s inhabitants included such notables as Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and United Nations peacekeeper Bisesa Dutt. For reasons unknown to her, Bisesa entered into communication with an alien artifact of inscrutable purpose and godlike power\u2013a power that eventually returned her to Earth. There, she played an instrumental role in humanity\u2019s race against time to stop a doomsday event: a massive solar storm triggered by the alien Firstborn designed to eradicate all life from the planet. That fate was averted at an inconceivable price. Now, twenty-seven years later, the Firstborn are back.This time, they are pulling no punches: They have sent a \u201cquantum bomb.\u201d Speeding toward Earth, it is a device that human scientists can barely comprehend, that cannot be stopped or destroyed\u2013and one that will obliterate Earth.Bisesa\u2019s desperate quest for answers sends her first to Mars and then to Mir, which is itself threatened with extinction. The end seems inevitable. But as shocking new insights emerge into the nature of the Firstborn and their chilling plans for mankind, an unexpected ally appears from light-years away.",

        "Description": "Six Sigma changed the face of manufacturing quality. Now, HumanSigma is poised to do the same for sales and services. Human Sigma offers an innovative research-based approach to one of the toughest challenges facing sales and services companies today: how to effectively manage the employee-customer encounter to drive business success.What would your company look like if you could increase the revenue and profitability potential of every customer by more than 20 percent? What if you could double the productivity of every employee? And what if these two phenomena together could drive overall organizational performance exponentially? What would your company look like? And how would you go about creating this kind of change? One thing is certain: Business leaders are never going to inspire higher levels of employee productivity and build more passionate customer relationships by doing the same things they have tried for the past 25 years. Business leaders need something fresh. Something new. The last thing they need is more of the same old conventional wisdom about \u201csatisfying\u201d their employees and their customers. Based on solid research by The Gallup Organization, Human Sigma will appeal to senior leaders and line managers alike who are looking for a way to dramatically increase productivity, retain a base of high value customers, and improve overall business performance. Human Sigma is: \u2022 Rigorous: Based on research involving hundreds of companies, and over 10 million employees and 10 million customers around the world. \u2022 Innovative: Cutting-edge management science supported by data, including brain imaging research into customer\u2019s emotional connections to the companies they love. \u2022 Practical: The principles in the book were developed from observations of real-life successes, not some fictional freaks-of-nature that exist only in a laboratory. As such, the lessons contained in the book have been tested in the real world, and can be applied in many situations. \u2022 Interactive: The book contains a code that can be used to estimate the potential value of HumanSigma to readers\u2019 organizations.",

If you want to take best advantage of the power and flexibility of this popular Oracle tool, you need this book.SQLPlus is an interactive query tool that is ubiquitous in the Oracle world. It is present in every Oracle installation and is  available to almost every Oracle developer and database  administrator. SQLPlus has been shipped with Oracle since at  least version 6. It continues to be supported and enhanced  with each new version of Oracle, including Oracle8 and Oracle8i.  It is still the only widely available tool for writing SQL scripts. Despite this wide availability and usage, few developers and DBAs know how powerful SQLPlus really is.This book introduces SQLPlus, includes a quick reference to  all of its syntax options, and, most important, provides chapters that describe, in step-by-step fashion, how to perform all of the  tasks that Oracle developers and DBAs want to perform with SQLPlus --  and maybe some they didn't realize they COULD perform with SQLPlus.  You will learn how to write and execute script files, generate ad hoc reports, extract data from the database, query the data dictionary  tables, customize your SQLPlus environment, and use the SQLPlus  administrative features (new in Oracle8i).This book is an indispensable resource for readers who are new to SQLPlus, a task-oriented learning tool for those who are already using it, and a quick reference for every user.A table of contents follows:Preface Introduction to SQLPlus Interacting with SQLPlus Generating Reports with SQLPlus Writing SQLPlus Scripts Extracting Data with SQLPlus Exploring Your Database with SQLPlus Advanced Scripting Tuning and Timing The Product User Profile Administration with SQLPlus Customizing Your SQLPlus EnvironmentAppendicesA.

        "Description": "On the cover of this book is a Pacific yew tree, found in the ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest. The bark of the Pacific yew tree produces Taxol, found to be a highly effective drug against ovarian and breast cancer. Taxol blocks mitosis during eukaryotic cell division. The supply of Taxol from the Pacific yew tree is vanishingly small, however. A single 100-year-old tree provides only about one dose of the drug (roughly 300 mg). For this reason, as well as the spectacular molecular architecture of Taxol, synthetic organic chemists fiercely undertook efforts to synthesize it. Five total syntheses of Taxol have thus far been reported. Now, a combination of isolation of a related metabolite from European yew needles, and synthesis of Taxol from that intermediate, supply the clinical demand. This case clearly demonstrates the importance of synthesis and the use of organic chemistry. It's just one of the many examples used in the text that will spark the interest of students and get them involved in the study of organic chemistry!",
