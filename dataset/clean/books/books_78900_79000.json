        "Title": "Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)",
        "Authors": "By Emerson, Robert M., Fretz, Rachel I., and Shaw, Linda L.",
        "Description": "In this companion volume John van Maanen's Tales of the Field, three scholars reveal how the ethnographer turns direct experience and observation into written fieldnotes upon which an ethnography is based.Drawing on years of teaching and field research experience, the authors develop a series of guidelines, suggestions, and practical advice about how to write useful fieldnotes in a variety of settings, both cultural and institutional. Using actual unfinished, \"working\" notes as examples, they illustrate options for composing, reviewing, and working fieldnotes into finished texts. They discuss different organizational and descriptive strategies, including evocation of sensory detail, synthesis of complete scenes, the value of partial versus omniscient perspectives, and of first person versus third person accounts. Of particular interest is the author's discussion of notetaking as a mindset. They show how transforming direct observations into vivid descriptions results not simply from good memory but more crucially from learning to envision scenes as written. A good ethnographer, they demonstrate, must learn to remember dialogue and movement like an actor, to see colors and shapes like a painter, and to sense moods and rhythms like a poet.The authors also emphasize the ethnographer's core interest in presenting the perceptions and meanings which the people studied attach to their own actions. They demonstrate the subtle ways that writers can make the voices of people heard in the texts they produce. Finally, they analyze the \"processing\" of fieldnotes--the practice of coding notes to identify themes and methods for selecting and weaving together fieldnote excerpts to write a polished ethnography.This book, however, is more than a \"how-to\" manual. The authors examine writing fieldnotes as an interactive and interpretive process in which the researcher's own commitments and relationships with those in the field inevitably shape the character and content of those fieldnotes. They explore the conscious and unconscious writing choices that produce fieldnote accounts. And they show how the character and content of these fieldnotes inevitably influence the arguments and analyses the ethnographer can make in the final ethnographic tale.This book shows that note-taking is a craft that can be taught. Along with Tales of the Field and George Marcus and Michael Fisher's Anthropology as Cultural Criticism, Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes is an essential tool for students and social scientists alike.",

        "Authors": "By Adams, Scott",
        "Description": "In The Dilbert Principle and current bestseller Dogbert&#39;s Top Secret Management Handbook, Scott Adams skewers the absurdities of today&#39;s corporate world. Now he takes the next step, turning his keen analytical focus on how human greed, stupidity and horniness will shape the future.   With this book, Adams follows in the footsteps of other great futurists, i.e., sitting at home making stuff up that can&#39;t be proven wrong for many years. Featuring the same mix of essays and cartoons that made The Dilbert Principle so uniquely entertaining, The Dilbert Future offers predictions on business, technology, society and government. Nobody is spared this time. Some predictions:  Children: They are our future, so we&#39;re pretty much hosed. Tip: Grab what you can while they&#39;re still too little to stop us.   Human Potential: We&#39;ll finally learn to use the 90 percent of the brain we don&#39;t use today, and find out that there wasn&#39;t anything in that part.   Longevity: We&#39;ll all live to 140. The Olympics will expand to include new events such as Complaining and Slow Driving.   Computers: Technology and homeliness will combine to form a powerful type of birth control.",

Successful people don\u2019t try to do everything. They learn to focus on the most important tasks and make sure those get done. They eat their frogs. There\u2019s an old saying that if the first thing you do each morning is eat a live frog, you\u2019ll have the satisfaction of knowing you\u2019re done with the worst thing you\u2019ll have to do all day. For Tracy, eating a frog is a metaphor for tackling your most challenging task\u2014but also the one that can have the greatest positive impact on your life. Eat That Frog! shows you how to organize each day so you can zero in on these critical tasks and accomplish them efficiently and effectively. In this fully revised and updated edition, Tracy adds two new chapters. The first explains how you can use technology to remind yourself of what is most important and protect yourself from what is least important. The second offers advice for maintaining focus in our era of constant distractions, electronic and otherwise.  But one thing remains unchanged: Brian Tracy cuts to the core of what is vital to effective time management: decision, discipline, and determination. This life-changing book will ensure that you get more of your important tasks done\u2014today!",

        "Authors": "By Lewis, David (EDT)",
        "Description": "Do you want to become more confident handling an oil brush? How about developing your skill in manipulating and mixing oil colors? This volume, filled with the experience and techniques of ten of today's finest oil painters, shows you how to discover and paint your own successful paintings, covering everything from the importance of brush selection to capturing the color nuances of a collapsing wave.Together these artists offer a treasury of instruction in oil technique: Charles Reid shows you how to handle an oil brush with dexterity and how to make handling and mixing color simple. Wendon Blake, George Cherepov, Paul Strisik, and Richard Schmid teach you how to capture the magnificence of a full landscape, and the more subtle characteristics of the countryside; Foster Caddell shows you how to overcome elementary errors in composition, balance of values and especially how to handle color in the landscape; E. John Robinson demonstrates how to capture the color and awesome power in the sea and shore; Ken Davies teaches you how to render sharp focus still lifes in oil; and John Howard Sanden, Charles Pfahl and Jane Corsellis show you how to paint the human portrait and figure, perhaps the most intriguing painting subject of all. The book is divided into seven sections: oil Brushwork, handling color, landscapes, color in landscapes, seascapes, sharp focus, and figures and portraits. Each section's full-color step-by-step demonstrations clearly illustrate how the artists achieve their striking results, and how you can too.Profusely illustrated and entirely in color, Oil Painting Techniques is required reading for the amateur or intermediate oil painter who wants to develop his skill in this medium.",

        "Description": "With the explosive shock of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park and Stephen King's Carrie, Jupiter's Daughter introduces an unforgettable young heroine, the first human whose entire genetic character is programmed before birth. The result of a unique combination of scientific ambition and financial greed, this super baby is born into a world not quite ready for her.When venture capitalist Dalton Stewart meets up with Nobel Prize-winning Harold Goth and his controversial experiments with human genes, a risky plan is born: to develop and exploit a computer program that will create a markedly superior child. Dalton's own wife, Anne, is chosen - without her knowledge - to be the mother of the first genetically engineered improvement of the human species.The night Genevieve Stewart is born - at midnight, on January 1, 2000 - her creator dies and his laboratory is destroyed. And the world's most dangerous human experiment begins.Anne is both enchanted and frightened by her daughter's precocity. Genny's health is perfect, her intelligence and physical strength way above average, and her senses supernaturally keen. And as she matures, she begins to demonstrate mysterious mental and physical powers.This extraordinary child - and the program that created her - become the focus of a deadly international competition involving a sadistic German baroness and the governments of the United States and Japan. How Genny and her mother ultimately outwit and defeat those who conspire to exploit the child forms the story's central narrative and its stunning conclusion.The all-too-possible secret of Genny's genetic programming takes us to the dark heart of the controversial science of genetics and raises profoundly disturbing ethical questions.",

        "Title": "The Great Depression Ahead: How to Prosper in the Crash Following the Greatest Boom in History",
        "Authors": "By Dent, Harry S.",
        "Description": "The first and last economic depression that you will experience in your lifetime is just ahead. The year 2009 will be the beginning of the next long-term winter season and the initial end of prosperity in almost every market, ushering in a downturn like most of us have not experienced before. Are you aware that we have seen long-term peaks in our stock market and economy very close to every 40 years due to generational spending trends: as in 1929, 1968, and next around 2009? Are you aware that oil and commodity prices have peaked nearly every 30 years, as in 1920, 1951, 1980 -- and next likely around late 2009 to mid-2010? The three massive bubbles that have been booming for the last few decades -- stocks, real estate, and commodities -- have all reached their peak and are deflating simultaneously.Bestselling author and renowned economic forecaster Harry S. Dent, Jr., has observed these trends for decades. As he first demonstrated in his bestselling The Great Boom Ahead, he has developed analytical techniques that allow him to predict the impact they will have. The Great Depression Ahead explains \"The Perfect Storm\" as peak oil prices collide with peaking generational spending trends by 2010, leading to a more severe downtrend for the global economy and individual investors alike.He predicts the following:? The economy appears to recover from the subprime crisis and minor recession by mid-2009 -- \"the calm before the real storm.\"? Stock prices start to crash again between mid- and late 2009 into late 2010, and likely finally bottom around mid-2012 -- between Dow 3,800 and 7,200.? The economy enters a deeper depression between mid-2010 and early 2011, likely extending off and on into late 2012 or mid-2013.? Asian markets may bottom by late 2010, along with health care, and be the first great buy opportunities in stocks.? Gold and precious metals will appear to be a hedge at first, but will ultimately collapse as well after mid- to late 2010.? A first major stock rally, likely between mid-2012 and mid-2017, will be followed by a final setdback around late 2019/early 2020.? The next broad-based global bull market will be from 2020-2023 into 2035-2036.Conventional investment wisdom will no longer apply, and investors on every level -- from billion-dollar firms to the individual trader -- must drastically reevaluate their policies in order to survive. But despite the dire news and dark predictions, there are real opportunities to come from the greatest fire sale on financial assets since the early 1930s. Dent outlines the critical issues that will face our government and other major institutions, offering long- and short-term tactics for weathering the storm. He offers recommendations that will allow families, businesses, investors, and individuals to manage their assets correctly and come out on top. With the right knowledge and preparation, you can take advantage of new wealth opportunities rather than get caught in a downward spiral. Your life is about to change for reasons outside of your control. You can't change the direction of the winds, but you can reset your sails!",

Forty turkeys roasted to find the best Thanksgiving bird. Duck prepared ten different ways to ensure the crispiest skin and moistest meat. Countless chickens basted and turned to determine that preheating the roasting pan is the secret to the tastiest one. No other cookbook has taken this approach to the subject, and no other book has broken such new ground in the kitchen.Master recipes provide all the basics to prepare poultry in particular styles--from fried chicken to braised quail, saut\u00e9ed turkey cutlets to roasted Cornish game hens.The variations follow: an exhaustive listing that will yield fresh recipes for years to come. These include delights like Saut\u00e9ed Chicken Cutlets with Marsala, Chicken and Herb Dumplings with Spring Vegetables, and Cincinnati-Style Turkey Chili. There are even recipes specially designed to make use of leftovers. For grill enthusiasts, sidebars cover such topics as finding the best charcoal and setting up the grill for indirect cooking. Recipes range from easy grilled chicken wings to a show-stopping grill-roasted whole turkey guaranteed to be the best you've ever tasted. Step-by-step illustrations guide the reader through every technique. Informative sidebars rate everything from roaster racks to canned chicken broth. Enlightening, instructive, and invaluable, this is a book that any cook interested in poultry--and in learning the best way to prepare any bird--can't afford to be without.",

The White House: The History of an American Idea celebrates the mansion's 200 years in a readable, richly illustrated volume that brings together, for the first time, the story of the architecture of the White House and the story of the first families and designers who shaped it.Highlighted by little known details about official and domestic life, The White House reveals the numerous changes the building has undergone and the paradox of its survival. Designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban, the house required preservation efforts fewer than 25 years after its construction. Burned to a smoke-blackened shell by the British in 1814, the house was rebuilt, later to be threatened with replacement but retained, condemned to destruction but made new. Many of the resident presidents hired architects and made changes, small and large. This volume offers rare glimpses of long-vanished interiors and the discarded contributions of such giants of American architecture and design as Benjamin Latrobe, Thomas U. Walter, Louis Comfort Tiffany, and Charles McKim. Illustrations include drawings and photographs from the Historic American Buildings Survey as well as a large selection of historical plans, prints, and photographs, many never before brought together in one volume.Although built in the experimental years of the new nation and altered over its 200-year history, the White House remains the natural symbol of the American presidency and perhaps the best-known residence in the world. The White House tells the story of constant change-architectural, social, and political. The history of the house is a story of survival and growth that parallels that of the nation it has come to symbolize.",

        "Description": "Forget \"re-engineering,\" \"self-directed teams,\" \"cultural change,\" and all the rest of today's trendy management fads - fads that seem to come and go as fast as new car models or the latest clothing fashions. If you're looking for the management system with genuine staying power and that can produce dramatic and measurable results over both the short and long term, this revealing guide by one of the nation's leading behavioral psychologists describes the most important management strategy you will ever implement in your company.The system? \"It's the same as it's always been,\" explains Dr. Aubrey C. Daniels, \"the precise application of the laws that govern human behavior.\" By identifying what reinforces the people in your company and skillfully managing those reinforcers, you can attain the kind of individual performance that adds up to great organizational performance. The step-by-step methods you'll learn from this book are applicable to all people and all organizations all of the time! Use Dr. Daniels' tested performance management system to define reinforcers that work - and tailor them to meet individual employees' needs; set fair performance measurement standards - implement and maintain them with minimal cost and effort; provide constant feedback and reinforcement - the most powerful tools for enabling employees to improve and maintain their own performance; build effective reinforcers into every area of your organization - from compensation and incentive packages... to work rules... to office machinery that's employee-friendly; and eliminate those management practices which have been shown not to bring out the best in people - including slogans, exhortations, and numerical goals and quotas.Backed by performance management case studies at 3M, Xerox, Hewlett Packard, and other major firms, Bringing Out the Best in People gives you not only the tools you need to permanently revitalize productivity, but also a powerful reinforcement system for transforming your employees' work into something they're ready, willing - and yes, eager - to do.",

        "Title": "Turbulence in World Politics",
        "Authors": "By Rosenau, James N.",
        "Description": "In this ambitious work a leading scholar undertakes a full-scale reconceptualization of international relations. Turbulence in World Politics is an entirely new formulation that accounts for the persistent turmoil of today's world, even as it also probes the impact of the microelectronic revolution, the postindustrial order, and the many other fundamental political, economic, and social changes under way since World War II. To develop this formulation, James N. Rosenau digs deep into the workings of communities and the orientations of individuals that culminate in collective action on the world stage. His concern is less with questions of epistemology and methodology and more with the development of a comprehensive theoryone that is different from other paradigms in the field by virtue of its focus on the tumult in contemporary international relations. The book depicts a bifurcation of global politics in which an autonomous multi-centric world has emerged as a competitor of the long established state-centric world. A central theme is that the analytic skills of people everywhere are expanding and thereby altering the context in which international processes unfold. Rosenau shows how the macro structures of global politics have undergone transformations linked to those at the micro level: long-standing structures of authority weaken, collectivities fragment, subgroups become more powerful at the expense of states and governments, national loyalties are redirected, and new issues crowd onto the global agenda. These turbulent dynamics foster the simultaneous centralizing and decentralizing tendencies that are now bifurcating global structures. \"Rosenau's new work is an imaginative leap into world politics in the twenty-first century. There is much here to challenge traditional thought of every persuasion.\" --Michael Brecher, McGill University",
