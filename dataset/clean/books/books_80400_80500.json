        "Authors": "By Ledeen, Michael A.",
        "Description": "From Accomplice to Evil: \u201cThe world is simmering in the familiar rhetoric and actions of movements and regimes\u2014from Hezbollah and al Qaeda to the Iranian Khomeinists and the Saudi Wahhabis\u2014who swear to destroy us and others like us, and we are repeating the errors of the recent past. Like their 20th-century predecessors, they openly proclaim their intentions, and carry them out whenever and wherever they can. Like our 20th-century predecessors, we rarely take them seriously or act accordingly.\u201d Acknowledging the existence and actions of evil enemies means accepting that we are at war, and then designing and con duct - ing a strategy to win. Accomplice to Evil takes a com pre hensive look at the errors we have made in the past when dealing with a mounting enemy force, why we\u2019ve refused to acknowledge the implications of a rising evil, and how we can defeat the forces that threaten us today.",

        "Description": "On the street and in the corridors of power, religion is surging worldwide. From Russia to Turkey to India, nations that swore off faith in the last century--or even tried to stamp it out--are now run by avowedly religious leaders. This book examines this new world, from exorcisms in S\u00e4ao Paulo to religious skirmishing in Nigeria, to televangelism in California and house churches in China. Since the Enlightenment, intellectuals have assumed that modernization would kill religion--and that religious America is an oddity. As these authors argue, religion and modernity can thrive together, and America is becoming the norm. The failure of communism and the rise of globalism helped spark the global revival, but, above all, 21st century religion is being fueled by a very American emphasis on competition and a customer-driven approach to salvation, and its destabilizing effects can already be seen far from Iraq or the World Trade Center.--From publisher description.",

That requires a technique book.\"What you'll find in this book is an alphabetical list of sixty-five recipe-driven, technique-centered explications that build out into hundreds of dishes.\"Armed with the knowledge of the simple mechanics of a dish, the five or so steps it takes to make it, you can walk into the market, find what's fresh (or on special), bring it home, and have dinner on the table without any worries, any overly romantic pretensions, or any cookbooks piled on the floor: fresh every time\u2014and your way, too.\"\u2014from the Introduction\"The recipes are structured without being fussy and the majority are relatively easy.

        "Title": "Small Pieces Loosely Joined: A Unified Theory Of The Web",
        "Authors": "By Weinberger, David",
        "Description": "The Web has not been hyped enough. That's the startling thesis of this one-of-a-kind book that's sure to become a classic work of social commentary. Just as Marshall McLuhan forever altered our view of broadcast media, Weinberger shows that the new medium of the Web is not only altering social institutions such as business and government but, more important, is transforming bedrock concepts of our culture such as space, time, the public, and even reality itself.Weinberger introduces us to denizens of this new world, among them Zannah, whose online diary turns self-revelation into play; Tim Bray, whose map of the Web reveals what's at the heart of the new Web space; and Danny Yee and Claudiu Popa, part of the new breed of Web experts we trust despite their lack of qualifications. Through stories of life on the Web, an insightful take on some familiar (and some unfamiliar) Web sites, and a wicked sense of humor, Weinberger puts the Web into the social and intellectual context we need to begin assessing its true impact on our lives. The irony, according to Weinberger, is that this new technology is more in tune with our authentic selves than is the modern world. Funny, provocative, and ultimately hopeful, Small Pieces Loosely Joined makes us look at the Web--and at life--in a new light.From Small Pieces Loosely Joined:The Web has sent a jolt through our culture, zapping our economy, our ideas about the sharing of creative works, and possibly even institutions such as religion and government. Why? How do we explain the lightning charge of the Web? If it has fallen short of our initial hopes and fears about its transformational powers, why did it excite those hopes and fears in the first place? Why did this technology hit our culture like a bolt from Zeus?Suppose--just suppose--that the Web is a new world we're just beginning to inhabit...If the Web is changing bedrock concepts such as space, matter, time, perfection, public, knowledge, and morality--each a chapter of this book--no wonder we're so damn confused. That's as it should be. The Web is enabling us to rediscover what we've always known about being human: we are connected creatures in a connected world about which we care passionately...If this is true, then for all of the over-heated, exaggerated, manic-depressive coverage of the Web, we'd have to conclude that the Web in fact has not been hyped enough.",

        "Description": "A brilliantly imagined, lavish, and transporting novel of a young woman's search for the truth about her family's mythic past  Meg Mabry has spent her life with her back turned to her legendary family legacy. In the 1890s her great-grandmother Hannah Bass composed starkly revealing diaries of her life on the southwestern frontier, first as a Harvey Girl at the glamorous Montezuma Resort in New Mexico and later as the wife of brilliant, and often-absent, railway engineer Eliott Bass. A generation later, Hannah's daughter, Claudia Bass, renowned historian known to all as Bassie, staked her academic career and reputation on these vibrant accounts, editing and publishing them to great acclaim. Thanks to the journals and to the industry Bassie created around them, Hannah would forever be one of the most romantic and famous figures of southwestern history.  Meg, however-Bassie's granddaughter-finds the family lore oppressive. When an excavation on the old Bass family property beckons a now-elderly and viper-tongued Bassie back to the fabled land of her childhood, Meg only grudgingly consents to accompany her. Determined not to live under the shadow of her ancestry, Meg has never even read the journals. But when an unexpected discovery casts doubt on the history recorded in their pages and harbored in Bassie's memories, Meg finally succumbs to the allure of her great grandmother's story and ventures even deeper into Hannah's life to unlock the mystery at the journal's core.  Reminiscent of Carol Shields's The Stone Diaries and the novels of Anita Shreve, The Night Journal is an enthralling tale in which Indian ruins, majestic desert hotels, and the hardship and boldness of frontier life fit seamlessly with a modern-day story of coming to terms with loss, family secrets, and shattering truths that lie shrouded in memory.",

        "Description": "Read Josh Sundquist's posts on the Penguin Blog.       One moment Josh Sundquist was your typical energetic and inquisitive nine year- old boy.  The next, his entire life   changed when he was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, a particularly virulent cancer strain that would eventually   claim Josh's left leg. Told in a wide-eyed, winning, heartbreaking voice, Just Don't Fall is the story of the   boy Josh was and of the young man he became. His story begins in a small, close-knit Southern town, where his   father-an aspiring pastor questioning his faith, and his mother-- homeschooling an ever- growing brood of   children-struggle to make ends meet. Josh journeys through a dizzying array of hospitals and eventually lands at a   pivotal place: the nearby mountain, where he makes his first attempt to ski. It is on the slopes, and later,   on the race course, that Josh's world bursts wide open in a way no one could have ever anticipated. The inspiration   to ski, however, and to become a champion, is not all that Josh has to contend with- there is adolescence to   navigate, the transition from homeschool to public high school, and girls. There is an increasingly turbulent and   difficult home life, with another cancer scare, a wayward brother, and dwindling finances to pay for training. Finally,   there is the wild, bumpy road to the Paralympics in Turin, with a misanthropic coach, training in the Rockies, and a   timeless friendship with a charismatic, imposing Brooklyn homeboy named Ralph. Through it all, Josh is   forced to question his abilities, his sanity, his will, his faith in himself, and his faith in God. Because of, not despite,   these myriad obstacles in his path, Josh is able to achieve a genuine grace: the grace to risk failure and to succeed.    It is the grace of a young boy becoming a man and of a champion realizing his greatest dream.  Josh Sundquist   shows us with charm, humility and remarkable strength that even if we fall, this inner grace can lift us up and carry   us over the many mountains we all must face.",

Its direct style, clarity, and beauty place it at the forefront of Buddhist sacred literature, and its noble intent raises it to the highest level of humanity's spiritual guides. Easily accessible to any reader, the Dhammapada offers a wealth of wisdom for the novice, as well as the most ardent and experienced of spiritual seekers.Gathered by Buddhist masters into related groups \u2014 \"On Earnestness,\" \"Flowers,\" \"The Fool,\" \"The Wise Man,\" \"Happiness,\" \"Pleasure\" \u2014 these ancient texts transcend the limitations of time, tradition, and culture to express the ethical principle underlying all wise and compassionate philosophy and conduct. Here are the Four Truths that reveal the nature of the world and our lot in it; here also is the Eightfold Path, the way to enlightenment, incorporating the means to overcome the essential suffering revealed by the Four Truths as the essence of life. The Dhammapada serves as a coherent summation of the necessities for following the Eightfold Path as well as an encouraging and thought-provoking resource to consult along the way.Expressed with great beauty and translated with painstaking scholarship, this classic guide is certain to stimulate, challenge, and inspire students of religion and philosophy as well as all who thirst for enlightenment.",

In her novels, home-cooked food, family, renaissance art, Italian history, and local politics play as central a role as an unsolved crime. The Girl of His Dreams opens with a major event in Brunetti\u2019s family, and keeps the theme of family close to the fore. When a friend of Guido Brunetti\u2019s brother, a priest recently returned from years of missionary work in Africa, calls on the Commissario with a request, Brunetti suspects the man has hidden motives. An American-style Christian sect has begun meeting in private homes in the city, and it\u2019s possible the priest is merely apprehensive of the competition. Nevertheless, Brunetti and his wife, Paola, decide to go undercover. But when a girl\u2019s body is found floating in a canal, Brunetti must put everything aside to investigate the secretive world of her people, the gypsies, who exist on the fringes of society. Thought provoking, eye opening, and profoundly moving, The Girl of His Dreams is classic Donna Leon\u2014and a spectacular, heart-wrenching addition to the series. \u00a0 \u201cA showcase of nuanced characterization, acute observation and seamless plotting.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post",
