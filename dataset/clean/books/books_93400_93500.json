Gripping, unnerving, exhilarating, and haunting, Sleepless is well worth staying up for.What former philosophy student Parker Hass wanted was a better world. A world both just and safe for his wife and infant daughter. So he joined the LAPD and tried to make it that way. But the world changed. Struck by waves of chaos carried in on a tide of insomnia. A plague of sleeplessness.Park can sleep, but he is wide awake. And as much as he wishes he was dreaming, his eyes are open. He has no choice but to see it all. That's his job. Working undercover as a drug dealer in a Los Angeles ruled in equal parts by martial law and insurgency, he's tasked with cutting off illegal trade in Dreamer, the only drug that can give the infected what they most crave: sleep.After a year of lost leads and false trails, Park stumbles into the perilous shadows cast by the pharmaceuticals giant behind Dreamer. Somewhere in those shadows, at the nexus of disease and drugs and money, a secret is hiding. Drawn into the inner circle of a tech guru with a warped agenda and a special use for the sleepless themselves, Park thinks he knows what that secret might be.\u00a0To know for certain, he will have to go deeper into the restless world. His wife has become sleepless, and their daughter may soon share the same fate. For them, he will risk what they need most from him: his belief that justice must be served. Unknown to him, his choice ties all of their futures to the singularly deadly nature of an aging mercenary who stalks Park.The deeper Park stumbles through the dark, the more he is convinced that it is obscuring the real world. Bring enough light and the shadows will retreat. Bring enough light and everyone will see themselves again. Bring enough light and he will find his way to the safe corner, the harbor he's promised his family. Whatever the cost to himself.It is July 2010.The future is coming.Open your eyes.",

Western governments, greedy for the natural resources, turn a blind eye to the routine oppression, deaths, and disappearances. To bring attention to the plight of her people, Sophia turns to economic terrorism, devising a plan to sabotage world currency markets. The goal: bring the mightiest corporations and economies to their knees. Her scheme will be neither cheap nor easy. Money she gets from some dubious backers, but she is also needs highly secret financial information\u2014and some very special software to manipulate it. For these, she heads to the International Monetary and Financial Organization (IMFO) where she must woo Harry Hoffinger, whose cutting-edge computer model is crucial to Sophia\u2019s plan. Sophia\u2019s penchant for confidential data\u2014and for Harry\u2014catches the eye of Celine O\u2019Rourke, an embittered IMFO veteran, whose dogged pursuit of Sophia\u2019s secret takes her from the riot-torn streets of Jakarta to the corridors of power in Washington DC and the hallowed halls of the Palais des Nations in Geneva. As the financial markets begin to crumble, and the lives of key finance ministers hang in the balance, both women will learn the price of love\u2014and the cost of betrayal.",

A better question is: Do you want to know everything about Microsoft Word? Probably not. You don't want to know all the command options, all the typographical mumbo-jumbo, or even all those special features that you know are in there but terrify you. No, all you want to know is the single answer to a tiny question. Then you can happily close the book and be on your way. If that's you, you've found your book.Good news: This book is not meant to be read from cover to cover. Microsoft Word 2000 For Dummies is full of self-contained sections, each of which describes how to perform a specific task or get something done. Sample sections you encounter in this book includeSaving your stuffCutting and pasting a blockQuickly finding your placeAligning paragraphsA quick way to cobble a table togetherA caption for your figureStep-by-step mail merging guideThere are no keys to memorize, no secret codes, no tricks, no pop-up dioramas, and no wall charts. Instead, each section explains a topic as if it's the first thing you read in this book. Nothing is assumed, and everything is cross-referenced. Technical terms and topics, when they come up, are neatly shoved to the side where you can easily avoid reading them. The idea here isn't for you to learn anything. This book's philosophy is to help you look it up, figure it out, and get back to work.This book informs and entertains. And it has a serious attitude problem. After all, the goal of the book is not to teach you to love Microsoft Word. Instead, be prepared to encounter some informative, down-to-earth explanations \u2013 in English \u2013 of how to get the job done by using Microsoft Word. You take your work seriously, but you definitely don't need to take Microsoft Word seriously.",

Interspersed with memorable images from the climax of Super Bowl XLII, Paolantonio tackles varying American themes from Manifest Destiny to \u201cfourth and one\u201d as he goes deep in order to answer the age-old questionWhy does America love football so much? An unabashedly celebratory explanation of America\u2019s love affair with the game and the men who make it possible, this work sheds light on topics such as how the pioneers and cowboys helped create a game that resembled their march across the continent, why rugby and soccer don't excite the American male like football does, how rule changes are continually made to enhance the dramatic action and create a better narrative, the eternal appeal of the heroic quarterback position, the military lineage from General Douglas MacArthur to the New York Jets\u2019 head coach Eric Mangini, and how the burgeoning medium of television identified and exploited the NFL\u2019s great characters.

        "Title": "Doing Virtuous Business: The Remarkable Success of Spiritual Enterprise",
        "Authors": "By Malloch, Theodore Roosevelt",
        "Description": "Can the concept of \"Spiritual Capital\" actually ensure a company's success?Critics of capitalism view big businesses as insatiable masters of the universe with little regard for the public. They label those who create wealth as greedy, malicious, and unscrupulous.\u00a0Doing Virtuous Business\u00a0answers these charges head-on. In this insightful and original book, Theodore Roosevelt Malloch presents the bold idea that the creation of wealth by virtuous means is the most important thing that can be done for society.Doing Virtuous\u00a0Business\u00a0explains the true purpose of business and illuminates the connection between a free economy and religious liberty.\u00a0 Drawing from the notion of \"social capital,\" which has been developed by generations of scholars, Malloch adds the concept of \"spiritual capital\" as a foundation for social progress and also a necessity for responsible and successful enterprise. He details the virtues that sustain a business and a free market\u2014virtues that build up a network of trust, which is critical to the global economy.Malloch reveals that a company's\u00a0soul\u00a0determines its \"spiritual capital,\" an equally imperative foundation to success.\u00a0 From Wal-Mart to IBM, Malloch demonstrates how companies that operate on ethical models informed by spiritual traditions have outperformed their competitors.\u00a0 This book is a welcome moral defense of free enterprise and a sensible guide for achieving the ideal of virtuous business.\u00a0Besides making the world a better place, Malloch argues, virtuous enterprise makes companies far more successful and profitable than they otherwise would be. He presents case studies of virtuous business in the Judeo-Christian tradition as well as statistical analysis demonstrating how companies that operate on ethical models have outperformed their competitors over the long run.",

        "Description": "The latest book from Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf explains why global imbalances cause financial crises\u2014including the one ravaging the United States right now\u2014and outlines the steps for ending this destructive cycle.Reviewing global financial crises since 1980, Wolf lays bare the links between the microeconomics of finance and the macroeconomics of the balance of payments, demonstrating how the subprime lending crisis in the United States fits into a pattern that includes the economic shocks of 1997, 1998, and early 1999 in Latin America, Russia, and Asia. He explains why the United States is now the \"borrower and spender of last resort,\" makes the case that this is an untenable arrangement, and argues that global economic security depends on the ability of emerging economies to develop robust financial systems based on domestic currencies.Sharply and clearly argued, Wolf\u2019s prescription for fixing global finance illustrates why he has been described as \"the world's preeminent financial journalist.\"",

The once-humble tape has hit the big time, and now there are duct-tape clubs, competitions and websites. In the words of Red Green, head possum on the PBS-syndicated The Red Green Show, \"Spare the duct tape, spoil the job.\"    In this instructive, entertaining and downright funny how-to book, Joe Wilson shows how to rip, cut and fold ordinary duct tape to make 18 amazing projects, including:  Wallet  Barbecue apron  Lunchbox  Tool belt  Cell phone            holder  Baseball cap  TV chair caddy  Raingear for pets  Toilet roll cover  Halloween masks.

As the ship makes its way across the Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal, into the Mediterranean, the boys tumble from one adventure to another, bursting all over the place like freed mercury. But there are other diversions as well: one man talks with them about jazz and women, another opens the door to the world of literature.

Another Cat\u2019s Table denizen, the shadowy Miss Lasqueti, is perhaps more than what she seems. And very late every night, the boys spy on a shackled prisoner, his crime and his fate a galvanizing mystery that will haunt them forever.    As the narrative moves between the decks and holds of the ship and the boy\u2019s adult years, it tells a spellbinding story\u2014by turns poignant and electrifying\u2014about the magical, often forbidden, discoveries of childhood and a lifelong journey that begins unexpectedly with a spectacular sea voyage.",

        "Description": "\u201cNewton's contribution is as cogent an inventory of Eisenhower's White House years as I've ever read. He blends masterful writing with historic detail and provides the value-added of Ike as the man and the leader.\u201d\u2014Chuck Hagel, Distinguished Professor, Georgetown University; U.S. Senator (1997\u20132009)Newly discovered and declassified documents make for a surprising and revealing portrait of the president we thought we knew.America\u2019s thirty-fourth president was belittled by his critics as the babysitter-in-chief. This new look reveals how wrong they were. Dwight Eisenhower was bequeathed the atomic bomb and refused to use it. He ground down Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism until both became, as he said, \"McCarthywasm.\" He stimulated the economy to lift it from recession, built an interstate highway system, turned an $8 billion deficit in 1953 into a $500 million surplus in 1960. (Ike was the last President until Bill Clinton to leave his country in the black.) The President Eisenhower of popular imagination is a benign figure, armed with a putter, a winning smile, and little else. The Eisenhower of veteran journalist Jim Newton's rendering is shrewd, sentimental, and tempestuous. He mourned the death of his first son and doted on his grandchildren but could, one aide recalled, \"peel the varnish off a desk\" with his temper. Mocked as shallow and inarticulate, he was in fact a meticulous manager. Admired as a general, he was a champion of peace. In Korea and Vietnam, in Quemoy and Berlin, his generals urged him to wage nuclear war. Time and again he considered the idea and rejected it. And it was Eisenhower who appointed the liberal justices Earl Warren and William Brennan and who then called in the military to enforce desegregation in the schools.Rare interviews, newly discovered records, and fresh insights undergird this gripping and timely narrative.JIM NEWTON is a veteran journalist who began his career as clerk to James Reston at the New York Times. Since then, he has worked as a reporter at the Atlanta Constitution and as a reporter, bureau chief and editor at the Los Angeles Times, where he presently is the editor-at-large and author of a weekly column. He also is an educator and author, whose acclaimed biography of Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice for All: Earl Warren and the Nation He Made, was published in 2006. He lives in Pasadena, CA.",

        "Description": "From the bestselling author of The Double Bind, Skeletons at the Feast, and Secrets of Eden, comes a riveting and dramatic ghost story. In a dusty corner of a basement in a rambling Victorian house in northern New Hampshire, a door has long been sealed shut with 39 six-inch-long carriage bolts.             The home's new owners are Chip and Emily Linton and their twin ten-year-old daughters. Together they hope to rebuild their lives there after Chip, an airline pilot, has to ditch his 70-seat regional jet in Lake Champlain after double engine failure. Unlike the Miracle on the Hudson, however, most of the passengers aboard Flight 1611 die on impact or drown. The body count? Thirty-nine \u2013 a coincidence not lost on Chip when he discovers the number of bolts in that basement door. Meanwhile, Emily finds herself wondering about the women in this sparsely populated White Mountain village \u2013 self-proclaimed herbalists \u2013 and their interest in her fifth-grade daughters. Are the women mad? Or is it her husband, in the wake of the tragedy, whose grip on sanity has become desperately tenuous?   The result is a poignant and powerful ghost story with all the hallmarks readers have come to expect from bestselling novelist Chris Bohjalian: a palpable sense of place, an unerring sense of the demons that drive us, and characters we care about deeply. The difference this time? Some of those characters are dead.",

        "Description": "If chefs are the new rock stars, Anne wants you to rock in your own kitchen!\u00a0For Anne Burrell, a classically trained chef and host of Food Network\u2019s Secrets of a Restaurant Chef (where she shares impressive recipes and smart techniques that anyone can master), and Worst Cooks in America (the show that transforms hopeless home cooks), being a rock star in the kitchen means having the confidence and ability to get a great meal on the table without a sweat.\u00a0 In her debut cookbook, she presents 125 rustic yet elegant recipes, all based on accessible ingredients, along with encouraging notes and handy professional tricks that will help you cook more efficiently at home.With Anne's guidance, even the novice cook can turn out showstoppers like Whole Roasted Fish or Rack of Lamb Crusted with Black Olives, which are special enough for guests but easy enough for a weekday evening. For Piccolini (Little Nibbles), try making Truffled Deviled Eggs, Sausage and Pancetta Stuffed Mushrooms, or Baked Ricotta with Rosemary and Lemon. Delicious first courses include Pumpkin Soup with Allspice Whipped Cream and Garlic Steamed Mussels with Piment\u00f3n Aioli. And if you're craving pasta, Chef Anne's Light-as-a-Cloud Gnocchi, Sweet and Spicy Sausage Rag\u00f9, or Killer Mac and Cheese with Bacon will blow you away.Whether she's telling you how to use garlic most effectively (\"perfume the oil, remove the garlic, and ditch it\u2014it's fulfilled its garlic destiny!\") or reaffirming the most important part of cooking (it should have the \u201csparkle factor!\u201d), you will never feel alone at the stove. Anne's effervescent personality and unmatched vitality will be there every step of the way--as teacher, coach, cooking partner, and friend.Organized from \u201cPiccolini and Firsts\u201d to \u201cPasta, Seconds, Sides,\u201d and, of course, \u201cDessert\u201d Cook Like a Rock Star is all about empowering you with the confidence to own what you do in your kitchen, to be excited by what you're making, and to experience the same kind of joy that Anne feels everyday when she cooks and eats.",
