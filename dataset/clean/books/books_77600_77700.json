        "Description": "\"Few books in recent years, if any, offer such a comprehensive overview of what ails India, its politicians and its people; and few writers, apart from Nirad Chaudhury and V. S. Naipaul, benefit so obviously from the perspective Tharoor offers, that of an Indian with a profound empathy for his native culture, combined with the insight made possible by following India's progress from afar.\"--New York Times\"A hard-hitting, powerfully analytical and supremely articulate new book. . . . Tharoor discusses the 'flawed miracle of Indian democracy' from various angles, opting for a take-no-prisoners approach as he criticizes politicians, unpacks layers of misguided governmental policies and exposes the atavistic tendencies of special-interest pols.\" --Newsday\"Tharoor looks back at his country's first 50 years of independence, describing its challenges (illiteracy, poverty, sectarian violence and the ever-present caste problem) and its triumphs (a thriving democracy, a burgeoning economy) in lively, informative prose. He is particularly adept at describing all that India and Indians are not--not the same ethnicity, religion or language--to arrive at the nation's essence: that 'the singular thing about India was that you could only speak of it in the plural'.\" --Seattle Times",

Such change will not come from governments or corporations, she argues, but from the ageless process of thinking together in conversation. Turning to One Another encourages this process. Part I explores the power of conversation and the conditions-simplicity, personal courage, real listening, and diversity-that support it. Part II contains quotes and images to encourage the reader to pause and reflect, and to prepare for the work ahead-convening truly meaningful conversations. Part III provides ten \"conversation starters\"-questions that in Wheatley&apos;s experience have led people to share their deepest beliefs, fears, and hopes.",

        "Description": "Spicy. Sweet. Tasty. Tart. No . . . were not talking about the lovely ladies of Wisteria Lane, but their cooking. Bree, Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle may not be traditional housewives, but they do have their special talents in the kitchen. In The Desperate Housewives Cookbook, they share those recipes . . . and so much more!Tune in to ABC's monster hit Desperate Housewives on any given Sunday night, and youll salivate over everything from Bree's ber-gourmet repasts to Susan's what's-a-spatula simple suppers. They may have wildly different personalities and story lines, but if there's one thing the four heroines have in common, it's food. In The Desperate Housewives Cookbook, the show's millions of fans will find recipes for all the foods made famous by the show, as well as many others inspired by each housewife. For example:-Bree's elegant, impressive dinners feature dishes like Basil Pure Soup, Braised Duck, and Chicken Cutlets Saltimbocca.-Lynette's time-challenged lifestyle leads to quick, healthy, everyday fare like French Toast for Breakfast (or Dinner) with Blueberry Syrup; Warm Turkey, Muenster, and Coleslaw Wraps; and Potato Casserole.-Susan's lack of kitchen skills means that her dishes are of the couldnt-be-simpler (but still mouthwatering) variety, like a Salad of Roasted Peppers, Fresh Mozzarella, and Arugula; Foolproof Macaroni and Cheese; Chocolate Butterscotch Bars; and Garlic Mashed Potatoes.-Gabrielle enjoys the finest things in life -- and food is no exception. Her meals are gourmet, and most definitely prepared by a personal chef. Her faves include Shrimp with Chorizo and Red Pepper, Guacamole with Warm Chips, and Pineapple-Peach Smoothies.-Edie uses food for seduction as much as for sustenance. Her sensual favorites include Oysters Poached in Champagne and Cream, Sausage Puttanesca, and Ambrosia.",

        "Description": "Much has been written about the group of 14th-century warrior monks known as the Knights Templar. Some authors, such as Dan Brown in The Da Vinci Code, portray them as folk heroes wrongly accused. Others disagree, saying the Templar story is ultimately one of greed, deception, and idolatry. Just who were the Knights Templar? And what is their legacy? In The Templar Papers, author and historian Oddvar Olsen has assembled a veritable Who's Who of experts to unravel the mystery. Instead of rehashing previous scholarship, this book delves into new aspects of Templar lore, such as the origins of the order and its supposed survival after 1314. It attempts to answer the following:Were the Templars devil worshippers who venerated a mysterious head? Was the head that of John the Baptist? What exactly did they find in Solomon's Temple? Did they keep, and later hide, the Holy Grail and the Ark of the Covenant?You'll also discover the Templar link to Mary Magdalene and the Freemasons, including answers to questions such as:Were Jesus and Mary lovers or, in fact, husband and wife?Did Mary give birth to a child after Jesus' death? Did Freemasonry originate from the Templars?The Templar Papers offers the inquisitive reader several lifetimes of research and insight. This is a distinctive and truly unique compilation that will stimulate your mind and settle the controversy.",

Author Philip Buonpastore, a motorcycle journalist and retired US Air Force photographer, helps readers gear up to get back on a motorcycle (or get on one for the first time).In Part 1, Becoming a Motorcyclist,\u201d Buonpastore discusses the basics of buying the right bike, gear, and equipment and getting the bike up to speed. The book continues with a good overview of learning to ride, the importance of taking a road course, venturing out on the first ride, and extending rides to long-distance jaunts. Throughout Part 1 are sidebars by riding- safety instructor and expert Walt Fulton, offering sound advice on safety precautions and execution for every leg of the new and returning rider\u2019s journey. The author emphasizes what older riders should be aware of and which factors can affect their rides.

        "Description": "Anyone can tell you that sex is important, complex, exciting - and often difficult. We want affection? We want thrills? We want escape? We want true love? We want the raw edge?However rough the terrain, we occupy the land of sex and move in it. We keep our eyes closed or keep them open, make do with the body or use props. We're straight, we're gay, we're bi. We like sex lyrical, we like sex raunchy. We need familiarity, we crave newness. But can we communicate what we want? Do we admit it to ourselves?In this book, fifty-two people do admit their needs and communicate unforgettably while doing so. From twelve-yearold Amos Hartigan, who has yet to kiss a girl, to Judith Rothstein, age fifty-seven, who figures she has slept with a thousand men; from Jackie Dunhill, a bisexual finding liberation through S/M, to Protestant minister Eli Gregory, married and faithful for forty years, we learn about their realities and fantasies, their histories and hopes. They speak with extraordinary candor and in explicit detail about what they do. They reveal the singular landscape of their emotions: rapture, humor, pain, guilt, resignation, and passion. In many cases, they talking they do changes their lives immediately.Harry Maurer, the author of two previous oral histories, began this book because he noticed how hard it is for people to speak plainly about sex. By inviting such frank testimony from his subjects, he has cut through dogma, fear, and posturing to paint a serious and original group portrait of Americans as sexual beings. Sex: An Oral History is more illuminating than a library of how-to manuals, more erotic than a shelf of the best sex scenes in fiction.",

        "Description": "A plan to destroy America, a hundred years in the making, is about to be unleashed . . . can it be stopped? There is a powerful technique called the Overton Window that can shape our lives, our laws, and our future. It works by manipulating public perception so that ideas previously thought of as radical begin to seem acceptable over time. Move the Window and you change the debate. Change the debate and you change the country. For Noah Gardner, a twentysomething public relations executive, it\u2019s safe to say that political theory is the furthest thing from his mind. Smart, single, handsome, and insulated from the world\u2019s problems by the wealth and power of his father, Noah is far more concerned about the future of his social life than the future of his country. But all of that changes when Noah meets Molly Ross, a woman who is consumed by the knowledge that the America we know is about to be lost forever. She and her group of patriots have vowed to remember the past and fight for the future\u2014but Noah, convinced they\u2019re just misguided conspiracy-theorists, isn\u2019t interested in lending his considerable skills to their cause. And then the world changes. An unprecedented attack on U.S. soil shakes the country to the core and puts into motion a frightening plan, decades in the making, to transform America and demonize all those who stand in the way. Amidst the chaos, many don\u2019t know the difference between conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact\u2014or, more important, which side to fight for. But for Noah, the choice is clear: Exposing the plan, and revealing the conspirators behind it, is the only way to save both the woman he loves and the individual freedoms he once took for granted. After five back-to-back #1 New York Times bestsellers, national radio and Fox News television host Glenn Beck has delivered a ripped-from-the-headlines thriller that seamlessly weaves together American history, frightening facts about our present condition, and a heart-stopping plot. The Overton Window will educate, enlighten, and, most important, entertain\u2014with twists and revelations no one will see coming.",

        "Title": "Spoken from the Heart",
        "Authors": "By Bush, Laura",
        "Description": "In this brave, beautiful, and deeply personal memoir, Laura Bush, one of our most beloved and private first ladies, tells her own extraordinary story.Born in the boom-and-bust oil town of Midland, Texas, Laura Welch grew up as an only child in a family that lost three babies to miscarriage or infant death. She vividly evokes Midland's brash, rugged culture, her close relationship with her father, and the bonds of early friendships that sustain her to this day. For the first time, in heart-wrenching detail, she writes about the devastating high school car accident that left her friend Mike Douglas dead and about her decades of unspoken grief.  When Laura Welch first left West Texas in 1964, she never imagined that her journey would lead her to the world stage and the White House. After graduating from Southern Methodist University in 1968, in the thick of student rebellions across the country and at the dawn of the women's movement, she became an elementary school teacher, working in inner-city schools, then trained to be a librarian. At age thirty, she met George W. Bush, whom she had last passed in the hallway in seventh grade. Three months later, \"the old maid of Midland married Midland's most eligible bachelor.\" With rare intimacy and candor, Laura Bush writes about her early married life as she was thrust into one of America's most prominent political families, as well as her deep longing for children and her husband's decision to give up drinking. By 1993, she found herself in the full glare of the political spotlight. But just as her husband won the Texas governorship in a stunning upset victory, her father, Harold Welch, was dying in Midland.  In 2001, after one of the closest elections in American history, Laura Bush moved into the White House. Here she captures presidential life in the harrowing days and weeks after 9/11, when fighter-jet cover echoed through the walls and security scares sent the family to an underground shelter. She writes openly about the White House during wartime, the withering and relentless media spotlight, and the transformation of her role as she began to understand the power of the first lady. One of the first U.S. officials to visit war-torn Afghanistan, she also reached out to disease-stricken African nations and tirelessly advocated for women in the Middle East and dissidents in Burma. She championed programs to get kids out of gangs and to stop urban violence. And she was a major force in rebuilding Gulf Coast schools and libraries post-Katrina. Movingly, she writes of her visits with U.S. troops and their loved ones, and of her empathy for and immense gratitude to military families.  With deft humor and a sharp eye, Laura Bush lifts the curtain on what really happens inside the White House, from presidential finances to the 175-year-old tradition of separate bedrooms for presidents and their wives to the antics of some White House guests and even a few members of Congress. She writes with honesty and eloquence about her family, her public triumphs, and her personal tribulations. Laura Bush's compassion, her sense of humor, her grace, and her uncommon willingness to bare her heart make this story revelatory, beautifully rendered, and unlike any other first lady's memoir ever written.",

Resettling in America, the couple swore eternal fidelity to each other, but also swore to never, ever, under any circumstances get legally married. (Both were survivors of previous bad divorces. Enough said.) But providence intervened one day in the form of the United States government, which-after unexpectedly detaining Felipe at an American border crossing-gave the couple a choice: they could either get married, or Felipe would never be allowed to enter the country again. Having been effectively sentenced to wed, Gilbert tackled her fears of marriage by delving into this topic completely, trying with all her might to discover through historical research, interviews, and much personal reflection what this stubbornly enduring old institution actually is. Told with Gilbert's trademark wit, intelligence and compassion, Committed attempts to \"turn on all the lights\" when it comes to matrimony, frankly examining questions of compatibility, infatuation, fidelity, family tradition, social expectations, divorce risks and humbling responsibilities. Gilbert's memoir is ultimately a clear-eyed celebration of love with all the complexity and consequence that real love, in the real world, actually entails.",

With consumers avoiding the country's worst calorie offenses, some restaurants saw fit to remove them from the menu entirely. Consider this:\u00b7 After Chili's Awesome Blossom took the runner-up spot on the \"Worst Foods in America\" list, Chili's removed the appetizer from their menu entirely.\u00b7 Pepperidge Farm followed suit after being placed on the Worst Foods list and discontinued their Roasted Chicken Pot Pie.\u00b7 When Jamba Juice earned a citation on the Worst Drinks in America list, the chain stopped serving the largest size of their Chocolate Moo'd smoothie and recommitted itself to becoming one of the healthiest restaurant chains in the nation. The problem is, as the old crop of calorie atrocities were eliminated, a new army of gut-bombs emerged in their place. That's why the authors created Eat This, Not That! 2010, to empower you with the knowledge to battle a food industry bent on sabotage your waistline with unwanted and unnecessary calories.

When a brilliant American battleship gun designer dies in a sensational apparent suicide, the man's grief-stricken daughter turns to the legendary Van Dorn Detective Agency to clear her father's name. Van Dorn puts his chief investigator on the case, and Isaac Bell soon realizes that the clues point not to suicide but to murder. And when more suspicious deaths follow, it becomes clear that someone-an elusive spy-is orchestrating the destruction of America's brightest technological minds... and the murders all connect to a top- secret project called Hull 44. But that is just the beginning. As the intrigue deepens, Bell will find himself pitted against German, Japanese, and British spies, in a mission that encompasses dreadnought battleships, Teddy Roosevelt's Great White Fleet, Chinatown, Hell's Kitchen, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Isaac Bell has certainly faced perilous situations before, but this time it is more than the future of his country that's at stake- it's the fate of the world.",

Anita Blake is back in St. Louis and trying to live a normal life-as normal as possible for someone who is a legal vampire executioner and a U. S. Marshal. There are lovers, friends and their children, school programs to attend. In the midst of all the ordinary happiness a vampire from Anita's past reaches out. She was supposed to be dead, killed in an explosion, but the Mother of All Darkness is the first vampire, their dark creator. It's hard to kill a god. This dark goddess has reached out to her here-in St. Louis, home of everyone Anita loves most. The Mother of All Darkness has decided she has to act now or never, to control Anita, and all the vampires in America.  The Mother of All Darkness believes that the triumvirate created by master vampire Jean-Claude with Anita and the werewolf Richard Zeeman has enough power for her to regain a body and to immigrate to the New World. But the body she wants to possess is already taken. Anita is about to learn a whole new meaning to sharing her body, one that has nothing to do with the bedroom. And if the Mother of All Darkness can't succeed in taking over Anita's body for herself, she means to see that no one else has the use of it, ever again.  Even Belle Morte, not always a friend to Anita, has sent word:  \"Run if you can...\"",

Unwilling to accept the drug company's disingenuous excuse of production line problems, Dr. Kender hires private investigator Erin Pulaski to prove that something more sinister is going on at Schiffer Hartwin. Meanwhile, in Maryland, married FBI agents Lacey Sherlock and Dillon Savich are investigating a rather unusual case: Senator David Hoffman is experiencing a ghostly apparition with possible malicious intent. The case is baffling, and Sherlock and Savich are not sure what to believe, even after witnessing the disturbing specter for themselves. They're no closer to cracking the case when a call comes in from Connecticut: A top foreign Schiffer Hartwin employee has been found murdered behind the drug company's U.S. headquarters. Unbeknownst to the FBI, Erin Pulaski had uncovered a bombshell in her investigation: The Culovort shortage is set to bring in a windfall profit in excess of two billion dollars. Upon learning of the murder, Erin is certain it has something to do with her findings, but she risks exposing herself by coming forward. As the feds move in, the case becomes even more complicated for Erin, since the murder of a foreign national on federal land can mean only that the pharmaceutical house has a secret of epic proportions-one it would do anything to keep hidden.",

There's plenty of it around, and we all love to eat it. So why should anyone need to defend it? Because in the so-called Western diet, food has been replaced by nutrients, and common sense by confusion--most of what we\u2019re consuming today is longer the product of nature but of food science. The result is what Michael Pollan calls the American Paradox: The more we worry about nutrition, the less healthy we see to become. With In Defense of Food, Pollan proposes a new (and very old) answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words: \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" Pollan\u2019s bracing and eloquent manifesto shows us how we can start making thoughtful food choices that will enrich our lives, enlarge our sense of what it means to be healthy, and bring pleasure back to eating. \"Michael Pollan [is the] designated repository for the nation's food conscience.\" -Frank Bruni, The New York Times \" A remarkable volume . . . engrossing . . . [Pollan] offers those prescriptions Americans so desperately crave.\" -The Washington Post \"A tough, witty, cogent rebuttal to the proposition that food can be redced to its nutritional components without the loss of something essential... [a] lively, invaluable book.\" --Janet Maslin, The New York Times \"In Defense of Food is written with Pollan's customary bite, ringing clarity and brilliance at connecting the dots.\" -The Seattle TimesMichael Pollan\u2019s most recent book\u00a0Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation--the story of our most trusted food expert\u2019s culinary education--was published by Penguin Press in April 2013, and in 2016 it serves as the inspiration for a four-part docuseries on Netflix by the same name.",
