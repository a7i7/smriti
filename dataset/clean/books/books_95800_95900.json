Du Bois proposed the notion of the \"talented tenth,\" an African American elite that would serve as leaders and models for the larger black community. In this unprecedented collaboration, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and Cornel West--two of Du Bois's most prominent intellectual descendants--reassess that relationship and its implications for the future of black Americans. If the 1990s are the best of times for the heirs of the Talented Tenth, they are unquestionably worse for the growing black underclass. As they examine the origins of this widening gulf and propose solutions for it, Gates and West combine memoir and biography, social analysis and cultural survey into a book that is incisive and compassionate, cautionary and deeply stirring. \"Today's most public African American intellectual voices...West and Gates have made a valuable contribution.\"--Julian Bond, Philadelphia Inquirer\"Brilliant...a social, cultural and political blueprint...that attempts to illumine the future path for blacks and American democracy.\"--New York Daily News\"Henry Louis Gates., Jr., and Cornel West are among the most renowned American intellectuals of our time.\"--New York Times Book Review",

In a series of provocatively titled essay-like chapters, Garrison offers snapshots that take you from her evangelical press trip to the Promised Land in January, 2007, to the Presidential Promised Land, a.k.a. the 2008 elections. You will be treated to thoughtful, well-placed jabs at the shallow, self-reflective, self-righteous finger-pointing of those modern Christians who bend Heaven and theology to make Jesus into someone just like them. Along the way, Garrison captures glimpses of God as she spots both ordinary radicals operating below the spiritual radar and those extraordinary individuals who actually walk the walk.     At the crux of this sojourn is thoughtful and articulate consideration of how we \u201clost\u201d Jesus in the first place, and why we might want to stand face to face with him if we\u2019re going to truly model ourselves after him. Garrison suggests that real spiritual discernment involves looking Jesus up rather than serving him up.",

Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, this may be the most deliciously candid memoir ever written about official Washington\u2014a laugh-out-loud cri de coeur that shows what can happen to idealism in a town driven by self-interest.\u00a0 \u00a0Despite being raised by reliably liberal parents, Matt Latimer is, from an early age, lured by the upbeat themes of the Reagan Revolution and, in the tradition of Mary Tyler Moore, sets off from the Midwest for the big city, determined to \"make it after all.\"\u00a0 In Matt's glory-filled daydreams, he will champion smaller government and greater self-sufficiency, lower taxes and stronger defense\u2014and, by the force of his youthful passion, eradicate do-nothing boondoggleism and lead America to new heights of greatness.But first he has to find a job.\u00a0Like an inside-the-Beltway Dante, Matt chronicles his descent into Washington, D.C., hell, as he snares a series of increasingly lofty\u2014but unsatisfying\u2014jobs with powerful figures on Capitol Hill. One boss can't remember basic facts. Another appears to hide from his own staff, barricading himself in his office. When Fate offers Matt a job as chief speechwriter for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Matt finds he actually admires the man (causing his liberal friends to shake their heads in dismay), his youthful passion is renewed. But Rummy soon becomes a pi\u00f1ata for the press, and the Department of Defense is revealed as alarmingly dysfunctional.\u00a0Eventually, Matt lands at the White House, his heart aflutter with the hope that, here at last, he can fulfill his dream of penning words that will become part of history\u2014and maybe pick up some cool souvenirs. But reality intrudes once again. More like The Office than The West Wing, the nation's most storied office building is a place where the staffers who run the country are in way over their heads, and almost everything the public has been told about the major players\u2014Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Rove\u2014is wrong.\u00a0Both a rare behind-the-scenes account that boldly names the fools and scoundrels, and a poignant lament for the principled conservatism that disappeared during the Bush presidency, Speech-less will forever change the public's view of our nation's capital and the people who joust daily for its power.",

One evening, while the author was sitting by her wood stove, feet buried beneath her dog and a stack of seed catalogs by her side, she wondered, \"Why isn't there a 'Thomas Jefferson' around I can talk to?\" After all, continued her musing, popular history has it that it was Thomas Jefferson who, at the dawn of our republic, convinced his countrymen that tomatoes weren't poisonous. So began the imagined conversations with Thomas Jefferson. Ms. Simon, whose previous books were historical romances, now finds inspiration from her peppers and peas. Dear Mr. Jefferson is a passionate, sometimes whimsical, always fascinating narrative, construed as letters to Thomas Jefferson. In these letters she tells him of the trials and tribulations of growing vegetables and flowers while relaying Jefferson's own gardening stories and passions as if she were having a dialogue with him. The book's charm and humor is heightened with personal anecdotes borne out of the author's attempt to explain the conundrums and advances of modernity to the eighteenth-century renaissance man.",

        "Title": "The Pressured Child: Freeing Our Kids from Performance Overdrive and Helping Them Find Success in School and Life",
        "Authors": "By Thompson, Michael and Barker, Teresa",
        "Description": "The push for students to excel at school and get into the best colleges has never been more intense. In this invaluable new book, the bestselling co-author of Raising Cain addresses America\u2019s performance-driven obsession with the accomplishments of its kids\u2013and provides a deeply humane response.\u201cHow was school?\u201d These three words contain a world of desire on the part of parents to know what their children are learning and experiencing in school each day. Children may not divulge much, but psychologist Michael Thompson suggests that the answers are there if we know how to read the clues and\u2013equally important\u2013if we remember our own school days.School, Thompson reminds us, occupies more waking hours than kids spend at home; and school is full not just of studies but of human emotion\u2013excitement, fear, envy, love, anger, sexuality, boredom, competitiveness. Through richly detailed interviews, case histories, and student e-mail journals, including those of his own children, Thompson illuminates the deeper psychological journey that school demands, a journey that all children must take in order to grow and develop, whether they are academic aces or borderline dropouts. Most of us remember this journey, if we are honest with ourselves, but our children must experience it in their own way, for better or worse.In stories that are by turns poignant, shocking, uplifting, and inspiring, we see students grapple with the textured reality of their lives, devising their own unique strategies to survive and thrive in school. For parents, this book reveals the hidden emotional landscape of the school day and points toward the answers we both desire and dread as we seek to help our children find success in school and beyond.Bridging the worlds of the growing and the grown-up, and told in Thompson\u2019s compassionate voice as both psychologist and father, The Pressured Child shows us how to listen for the truth of our children\u2019s experience\u2013and how to trust, love, and ultimately let go of a child. It is a crucial book for our stressful age\u2013and an ideal resource for families struggling to survive it.",

One of the first (and the best-informed) Western observers to say that the United States could not win there either, he was killed in Vietnam in 1967 while accompanying a Marine platoon. Written by his widow Dorothy, Bernard Fall: Memories of a Soldier-Scholar tells the story of this courageous and influential Frenchman, who experienced many of the major events of the twentieth century. His mother perished at Auschwitz, his father was killed by the Gestapo, and he himself fought in the Resistance. It focuses, however, on Vietnam and on two love stories. The first details Fall\u2019s love for Vietnam and his efforts to save the country from destruction and the United States from disaster.  The second shows a husband and father dedicated to a cause that continuously lured him away from those he loved. With a foreword by the late David Halberstam.",

Shiva, like the Hindu god of destruction after which it was named, annihilates entire colonies with the help of its fiendish subordinates. Commander Claire Normandy struggles to prepare for Shiva's attacks, while Pilot Harry Silver realizes that he must deal with his own demons in order to help her. When the Berserkers approach, a decision is made to destroy the destroyer, whatever the cost. Neither side, however, is prepared for the incredible risks that emerge as the attack becomes imminent. Can Normandy, Silver, and their forces face the possibility that something wholly unexpected yet eerily familiar lies gnarled within the steel?",

        "Description": "Everywhere in America, the forces of digitization, innovation, and personalization are expanding our options and bettering the way we live. Everywhere, that is, except in our politics. There we are held hostage to an eighteenth century system, dominated by two political parties whose ever-more-polarized rhetorical positions mask a mutual interest in maintaining a stranglehold on power.The Declaration of Independents is a compelling and extremely entertaining manifesto on behalf of a system better suited to the future--one structured by the essential libertarian principles of free minds and free markets. Gillespie and Welch profile libertarian innovators, identify the villains propping up the ancien regime, and take aim at do-something government policies that hurt most of those they claim to protect. Their vision will resonate with a wide swath of frustrated citizens and young voters, born after the Cold War's end, to whom old tribal allegiances, prejudices, and hang-ups about  everything from hearing a foreign language on the street to gay marriage to drug use simply do not make sense.",
