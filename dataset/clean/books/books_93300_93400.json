In December 1944, while supporting General MacArthur's invasion of the Philippines, Admiral William \"Bull\" Halsey neglected the Law of Storms, placing the mighty U.S. Third Fleet in harm's way. Drawing on extensive interviews with nearly every living survivor and rescuer, as well as many families of lost sailors, transcripts and other records from naval courts of inquiry, ships' logs, personal letters, and diaries, Bruce Henderson finds some of the story's truest heroes exhibiting selflessness, courage, and even defiance.",

Jones an owner and enthusiast of the breed for nearly thirty years. While most upland bird hunters prefer a surefire pointing breed, Jones delights in the existential rhythm of working the fields with a good flushing dog - it's the spontaneity and the teamwork, not the number of kills, that mark the spirit of the hunt for him. During the past eleven years, Luke, a black Lab who's nearing retirement age, has been an invaluable companion both in the field and at home. But as Luke gets older, Jones realizes that it's time to train a new dog. That's when he decides to get Jake. And upon their first meeting, Bob can tell that this eight-week-old yellow Lab has all the makings of a beautiful, strong hunting dog.Accompanied by Bill Eppridge's lively photographs, Upland Passage is a wonderful weave of history, biography, and personal philosophy. Tracing the roots of the Labrador to its earliest ancestors, Robert Jones examines the relationship between man and dog, teaching us the elements of proper training, and showing us the lessons both man and dog stand to learn from each other.",

Full-color photos demonstrate the various stages of the organizing process, illustrating not just \"before and after,\" but the realistic, messy, all-important steps in between. Leist\u2019s method is based on the underlying principle that \u201cit\u2019s not about the stuff.\u201d She touches on the psychological reasons behind clutter and not letting go \u2014 such as procrastination, denial, thrift, and family history \u2014 but her underlying premise is that being organized is an on-going process, not a one-day event. By learning to sort, prioritize, and make fast, rational decisions about their household goods, readers become more efficient and functional not just at home, but in other areas of life as well.",

In Alphabet Juice, he celebrates the juju, the crackle, the sonic and kinetic energies, of letters and their combinations. He has a strong sense of right and wrong, but he is not out to prescribe proper English. His passion is for questions such as these: Did you know that both mammal and matter derive from baby talk? Have you noticed how wince makes you wince?Three and a half centuries ago, Thomas Blount produced his Glossographia, the first dictionary to explore derivations of English words. This Blount's Glossographia takes that pursuit to new levels. From sources as venerable as the OED and as fresh as Urbandictionary.com, and especially from the author's own wide ranging experience, Alphabet Juice derives an organic take on language that is unlike, and more fun than, any other.\"Amusing, bemusing, and smart as hell.\" \u2014Daniel Okrent, Fortune\"Danced in Blount's arms, English swings smartly.\" \u2014Jack Shafer, The New York Times Book Review\"Gracefully erudite and joyous.\" \u2014Katherine A.

In Rocco's 5 Minute Flavor, every dish is ready in 5 minutes or less, using 5 ingredients, and all for under $5 per serving. This is fast food with all of Rocco's celebrated expertise with flavor; food that no one will believe didn't take hours of work. A James Beard Award, two restaurants, a network television show, and two cookbooks into his profession, Rocco left the day-to-day restaurant business after a long career and many, many hours behind the stove. He asked himself, \"Can a chef find happiness in New York City without a restaurant?\" The answer is yes. Rocco began exploring the good life, having dinner parties at home and cooking for himself, instead of chomping down leftovers at 2 A.M. He discovered the keys to liberating the busy home cook: shop smart, keep a few key pantry items on hand, and get the most out of your stove -- cooking over high heat is the secret to meals in 5 minutes.",

During a long and productive life, Wright designed some 800 buildings, received scores of honors and awards, and left an indelible imprint on modern architectural theory and practice.In this charming, readable memoir, Wright the architect and father comes to life through the vivid recollections and firsthand knowledge of his son. John Lloyd Wright characterizes his father as \u201ca rebel, a jolt to civilization, whose romantic theme \u2014 purposive planning and organic unity in inventing and combining forms \u2014 is an epoch in the architecture of the world.\u201d His unique view of the \u201cepoch\u201d will intrigue architects, students, and all who admire the work of this visionary and uncompromising spirit. An added attraction of this volume is the inclusion of the complete text of William C. Gannet's The House Beautiful, an extremely rare work designed and printed by Frank Lloyd Wright.",

        "Description": "Investigating interesting problems about the world makes mathematics compelling and engaging, but many students experience math as simply a set of rules and procedures to memorize and repeat on tests. Writing, however, frees students of the idea that mathematics is a collection of right answers owned by teachers.  In Writing to Learn Mathematics, Joan Countryman demonstrates how you can dramatically improve students' reasoning capabilities using:  journals learning logs letters autobiographies investigations formal papers.   The text provides descriptions of writing activities that classroom teachers can use to enhance the learning of math and includes examples of student writing, from short journal entries to excerpts from longer research papers. Most helpful are the topics suggested to explore at different levels of the primary and secondary mathematics curriculum, including descriptions of student responses to these presentations.  Readers of Writing to Learn Mathematics will discover how writing can help students develop concepts and thinking skills as well as free them to recognize what they know--and what they want to explore.",
