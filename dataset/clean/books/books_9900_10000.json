Trattner's From Poor Law to Welfare State has served as the standard text on the history of welfare policy in the United States. The only comprehensive account of American social welfare history from the colonial era to the present, the new sixth edition has been updated to include the latest developments in our society as well as trends in social welfare.Trattner provides in-depth examination of developments in child welfare, public health, and the evolution of social work as a profession, showing how all these changes affected the treatment of the poor and needy in America. He explores the impact of public policies on social workers and other helping professions -- all against the backdrop of social and intellectual trends in American history.From Poor Law to Welfare State directly addresses racism and sexism and pays special attention to the worsening problems of child abuse, neglect, and homelessness. Topics new to this sixth edition include:A review of President Clinton's health-care reform and its failure, and his efforts to \"end welfare as we know it\"Recent developments in child welfare including an expanded section on the voluntary use of children's institutions by parents in the nineteenth century, and the continued discrimination against black youth in the juvenile justice systemAn in-depth discussion of Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein's controversial book,The Bell Curve, which provided social conservatives new weapons in their war on the black poor and social welfare in generalThe latest information on AIDS and the reappearance of tuberculosis -- and their impact on public health policyA new Preface and Conclusion, and substantially updated BibliographiesWritten for students in social work and other human service professions, From Poor Law to Welfare State: A History of Social Welfare in America is also an essential resource for historians, political scientists, sociologists, and policymakers.",

        "Authors": "By Steinbruner, John D.",
        "Description": "In the final days of this century, the United States will need to amend the core of its foreign policy&#151;a formidable task in a large democracy. American thinking, still grounded in post-World War II perceptions, has failed to keep pace with the demands of a changing world. New realities in the U.S. and international economies, in security conditions, and in world politics call for restructuring American foreign policy.The policy experts contributing to this volume state the process of public debate that must precede the hard political choices ahead. Barry P. Bosworth and Robert Z. Lawrence consider the ramifications of an American economy no longer an implicit source of leverage in pursuing policy objectives. William W. Kaufmann prescribes ways to preserve international commitments and ensure American security in spite of fiscally constrained defense budgets. John D. Steinbruner discusses efforts to achieve a more stable military balance. In a related chapters, Kenneth Flamm and Thomas L. McNaugher propose a redraft of American investment patterns to make the defense technology more consistent with contemporary security requirements.All of this domestic restructuring will take place within the constraints and opportunities created by recent changes in China and the Soviet Union, continued economic expansion in Japan, and persistent unrest in the Middle East. Harry Harding and Ed A. Hewett review the prospects for reform in China and the Soviet Union. Harry Harding and Edward Lincoln describe the surge in many Asian economies and the increased importance of Japan as a world power. And in the final chapter, Harold H. Saunders turns attention to the Middle East, where identifying desirable solutions continues to be far easier than finding realistic methods for achieving them.The inauguration of a new administration creates an opportunity for political debate, a new conceptual focus, and effective political consensus. Restructuring American Foreign Policy opens the debate.",

The distance he put between himself and his Southern homeland widened until he eventually settled in Canada and into modern metropolitan life.Decades later, on a spring morning in 1990, the death of Mays' Aunt Vandalia summons him back to the South. As a result of his fateful return, Mays experiences an awakening of feelings and attitudes linked to his early life and family heritage, and he begins an exploration of his past. The secrets he uncovers in Vandalia's home motivate him to search for answers through the Virginia tidewater forests his ancestors cleared, the colonial plantations of his distant antebellum relatives, and the towns in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana where they lived through almost four hundred years of American history. Along the route of his journey he encounters echoes of Faulkner, remnants of civil war, and the spirits of colonial-era roads now laden with strip malls. And like many before him whose ties to their homelands have been broken, Mays struggles with the facts, stereotypes, and contradictions that exist today and color his native cultural landscape.",

But the new year has brought a barrage of new allegations, and the president and his advisers face once again the challenge of spinning the news to their advantage, a challenge they have mastered many times before.In Spin Cycle, award-winning Washington Post reporter Howard Kurtz reveals the inside workings of Clinton's well-oiled propaganda machine?arguably the most successful team of White House spin doctors in history. He takes the reader into closed-door meetings where Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Mike McCurry, Lanny Davis, and other top officials plot strategy to beat back the scandals and neutralize a hostile press corps through stonewalling, stage managing, and outright intimidation. He depicts a White House obsessed with spin and pulls back the curtain on events and tactics that the administration would prefer to keep hidden, including: The secret report that Hillary Clinton ordered on a reporter investigating the Whitewater affair as part of a plan to discredit her.A tense, almost paranoid White House atmosphere in which the spinmeisters do not question the President about the various scandals because they don't want to learn information they might have to reveal to prosecutors or the press.The secret meeting between a Clinton operative and the editor of The New York Times that led to a presidential interview in which Clinton knew the questions in advance.Bill Clinton's success in reaping favorable publicity by secretly courting selected reporters and columnists in off-the-record White House meetings.Al Gore's feelings of betrayal as the scandal-hungry press turned on him and jeopardized his presidential candidacy in 2000. Spin Cycle is an all-too-human drama in which political operatives wrestle with their consciences as they struggle to protect the boss. As the scandal drums beat louder and louder, Kurtz shows what it takes for the president and his people to survive, and what happens to the truth along the way.",

While the NASDAQ has generated over three trillion dollars in new wealth over the past ten years, many companies are still playing by yesterday's rules, growing incrementally or expanding through risky mergers and acquisitions. In today's high-stakes environment, the question is not whether to venture but how far and fast can your company grow through new business creation. In Venture Catalyst, Don Laurie offers an insider's perspective on the explosive world of corporate venturing through interviews with such pioneers as Roger Ackerman of Corning, David Wetherell of CMGI, and Mitch Kapor of Accel. Moreover, he offers a practical framework for identifying new sources of growth, launching and managing ventures, balancing the tension between established discipline and entrepreneurial creativity, and maximizing the value of ventures. For executives, managers, entrepreneurs, and investors alike, Venture Catalyst is a powerful guide to thriving in the new economy.",

        "Description": "One evening in 1955, Howard Spence, a Mississippi field representative for the NAACP investigating the Emmett Till murder, was confronted by Klansmen who burned an eight-foot cross on his front lawn. \"I felt my life wasn't worth a penny with a hole in it.\" Twenty-four years later, Spence had become a respected pillar of that same Mississippi town, serving as its first black alderman.The story of Howard Spence is just one of the remarkable personal dramas recounted in Black Lives, White Lives. Not all of the tales told by the sixteen blacks and twelve whites interviewed are as encouraging; some are bitter accounts of failed promises, misunderstandings, and lost opportunities. Black and white, rich and poor, men and women, collectively they reveal in their own words the paradoxical realities wrought by three decades of tumultuous racial change.Beginning in 1968, Bob Blauner and a team of interviewers began to record the words of those caught up in the crucible of rapid racial, social, and political change. Unlike most restrospective oral histories, these interviews capture \"live\" the intense racial tension of 1968 as people talk with unusual candor about their deepest fears and prejudices. The diverse experiences and changing beliefs of these individuals, most of whom were interviewed again in 1979 and 1986, become an extraordinary commentary on the development of race relations since the 1960s.",

What are they like? Where do they come from? How do they learn their craft? Why do some have one style and others another? And, most of all, how come some are more successful than others, more respected, more important in the history of their field?Koppett shows how the most successful and influential of the more than 500 men who have actually managed in the majors can trace their descent from three exceptional men: John McGraw, Branch Rickey, and Connie Mack. They not only fashioned modern baseball's development in the first half of the twentieth century, but their direct influence is still visible and ubiquitous in every ballpark today.Filled with anecdotes and the author's firsthand observations of the many managers he has known during his long career, The Man in the Dugout is destined to become the armchair-general's and second-guesser's bible - required reading for all fans, sports-writers, athletes, big-league managers, and would-be big-league managers.",

Trachtenberg asks why, although everybody agrees something must be done about our public education system, nothing, or next to nothing, has actually happened? If what our students most lack are technical and mathematical skills, is the debate over western tradition vs. multiculturalism a red herring? Can total quality management really work in the stratified environment of American higher education? Whether examining the role of business in education, the value of political correctness, the frayed self-image of American higher education, or the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., Trachtenberg brings to each topic not only his thought-provoking insight and wry humor, but his own wealth of real-life experience in education, government, and business.",

First on her comedy variety show on Fox and then through her critically acclaimed hit HBO series, Tracey Takes On, Tracey has fashioned an astonishingly diverse gallery of richly imagined characters, each of whom has something profoundly amusing to say about the best and worst of the human condition.In Tracey Takes On - the book - these vivid creations are given an opportunity to spout off on such loaded topics as mothers, royalty, and childhood. They're all here - Mrs. Noh Nang Ning, the wily donut shop owner who's a bottomless well of home-spun, donut-centric philosophy; Chic, the Middle Eastern New York City cab driver and unabashed Disco-machismo reactionary; the wickedly superior and detached Her Royal Highness; Trevor Ayliss, the endearingly contemplative gay flight attendant who's seen it all; Long Island yenta Fern Rosenthal; Sydney Kross, the slick, misanthropic criminal-defense lawyer; washed-up bombshell actress and shameless self-promoter Linda Granger; and many more, including Tracey herself.",

These true tall tales feature touring pros Lee Trevino, Seve Ballesteros, Greg Norman, Sam Snead, Nick Faldo, Jack Nicklaus, Craig Stadler, and Gary Player as well as celebrity golfers Fred Astaire and Bobby Knight, among others. In the unpredictable world of nutty golf records, golf balls wind up in some extremely hard-to-hit places--up trees, in pockets, or in the beaks of hungry ravens-while putters and drivers are strangled, hurled for distance, or dragged behind cars by their revenge-seeking owners. Topless dancers, de-pantsed pros, streaking fans, and caddying llamas find their way onto some of America's most famous courses. Witty, wild, and wacky, The Golf Nut's Book of Amazing Feats and Records is your guide to the fairway phenomena that never find their way into standard golf record books.   Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo are the authors of the Sports Hall of Shame book series and the nationally syndicated \"Sports Hall of \"Shame\" comic feature. George White is golf editor of the Orlando Sentinel and contributes to many golf magazines.",

        "Description": "Some fathers and sons go fishing together. Some play baseball. David and Daniel Hays decided to sail a tiny boat 17,000 miles to the bottom of the world and back. This is their story.David is romantic, excitable, and reflective; Daniel is wry, comic, and down-to-earth. Together their alternating voices weave a story of travel, of adventure, and of difficult, dangerous blue-water sailing. The Caribbean, the Panama Canal, the Galapagos Islands, Easter Island, Cape Horn, the Falklands - these far-flung places spring vividly to life in My Old Man and the Sea.Father and son don't always get along, though. Daniel has been an uneasy and uneven student. Now, just out of college, he's unsure what to do next. He sees his father growing older, slower, more forgetful. David is haunted by memories of his own father, of the things they never said to each other, and the fear that he'll make the same mistakes with his son. But he gets angry when Daniel treats him like an old man.On this voyage, the son will become the captain, and the father will relinquish control. Before long they are at sea, headed for the huge waves and unceasing wind of the Southern Ocean with only their skill as sailors, a compass, a sextant, a ship's cat, and Sparrow, the 25-foot boat they've built together.Lovers of sailing and travel books will find this often hilarious, often moving tale of voyage and self-discovery to be in the tradition of Farley Mowat's The Boat Who Wouldn't Float, Bruce Chatwin's In Patagonia, and Paul Theroux's The Happy Isles of Oceania. But more than that, it's the story of a father and son who go down to the sea to find each other, and of what they bring back.",

        "Description": "With the unmistakable fire that has lit up Democratic thinking for more than a decade, Mario Cuomo delivers in these pages a vivid rebuke to the radical Republicans running riot in Washington - and a clear-eyed, commonsense assessment of \"where we are, where we're going, and what we should do about it.\"Forthright in confessing his party's own failings, Cuomo is relentless in dismantling the opposition, using the floodlight of his clear prose to reveal the evasion and show the inadequacy of the Contract with America. In its place he offers a hopeful vision of what we the people might achieve if we can only learn to remember that \"we're all in this together.\"Those who feel Congress has swung dangerously rightward will find here both hope and ammunition. But the book is not for partisans only: all of us can benefit from Cuomo's plain-English explanations of the great social and economic challenges that dog America's present and define her future.Written with a depth of understanding drawn from twenty years of daily involvement with local, state, and federal government and six decades as the American son of quintessential immigrants, this book is, as Cuomo explains, in many ways a tribute to the extraordinary, uncompromising wisdom of people like his parents and the parents of his wife, Matilda, seekers and believers who taught him the lesson America needs so badly now: \"that what is right is usually also what is necessary; that in helping one another we almost always help ourselves.\"",

        "Authors": "By Ungar, Sanford J.",
        "Description": "Drawing on richly textured interviews conducted from one end of the country to the other, veteran journalist Sanford J. Ungar documents the real-life struggles and triumphs of America's newest immigrants and assesses their contributions. He finds that the self-chosen who arrive every day, most of them legally, still enrich our national character and experience and make invaluable political, economic, social, and even gastronomic contributions.Ungar takes us inside immigrant communities - the Koreans in Los Angeles, the Poles in Chicago, the Cubans in Miami, the Ethiopians in Washington - and shows how our melting pot is becoming a mosaic in which ethnic groups proudly maintain their identities and yet add to the common good. He also introduces us to remarkable individuals - an Indian hotel keeper in Pensacola, a Vietnamese samaritan in rural Ohio, a Syrian traditionalist in Houston, a Haitian community organizer in Boston - all grappling with what it means to become an American today. Here, too, are glimpses inside the little-known worlds of the undocumented Irish, competing to win visas in the federal lottery, and of the tiny community of Iranian Jewish immigrants from Mashad, fighting to preserve their uniqueness from the perceived threat of assimilation.Ranging the country's southern frontier, the author goes on night duty with Border Patrol agents in Texas and California, crosses from Tijuana with Mexicans trying to evade the law, and visits a sanctuary for illegal immigrants in Brownsville. He explores immigration crises on both coasts and examines the new anti-immigrant mood sweeping America, finally concluding that California's Proposition 187 is as un-American a law as any we have today.",

How Could You Do That?! argues passionately against the self-indulgent subjective morality used in our society to excuse all sorts of bad behavior.In her lively, pull-no-punches style, Dr. Laura takes on the moral dilemmas of our time: from the mindless pursuit of pleasure and immediate gratification to taking the easy way out when those actions produce ugly or uncomfortable life-altering consequences. She demonstrates in no uncertain terms that personal values are never someone else's responsibility, but our own, and why choosing not to honor them actually compounds unhappiness. Finally, she explains that by disciplining self-indulgence and rising above temptation we can discover the infinite pleasures, the true happiness, of the moral high ground.",

At thirty, the author was at Bill Clinton's side during the presidential campaign of 1992, & for the next five years he was rarely more than a step away from the president & his other advisers at every important moment of the first term. What Liar's Poker did to Wall Street, this book will do to politics. It is an irreverent & intimate portrait of how the nation's weighty business is conducted by people whose egos & idiosyncrasies are no sturdier than anyone else's. Including sharp portraits of the Clintons, Al Gore, Dick Morris, Colin Powell, & scores of others, as well as candid & revelatory accounts of the famous debacles & triumphs of an administration that constantly went over the top, All Too Human is, like its author, a brilliant combination of pragmatic insight & idealism.

        "Authors": "By Brin, David",
        "Description": "For two thousand years, Jijo, planet of fugitives, has sheltered six bands of sapient beings, each with a different reason for fleeing the ancient civilization of the Five Galaxies. On Jijo, races that had been deadly enemies on the star lanes have instead found ways to get along, in a rough but promising peace. Their greatest wish: to be left alone. Their greatest fear, foretold in a dour religion: an inevitable Judgment Day, when godlike Galactic authorities will punish their illegal colony.Has that day now come? As starships fill Jijo's skies, humans and other settlers realize that things are even worse than that. With galaxies in turmoil, all the venerable laws have been cast aside. Now meddlers, criminals, and fanatics feel free to plunder this isolated world or carry out ancient grudges, including genocide for one of Jijo's six races - and possibly for all.Amid this crisis, human settlers and their neighbors must make heroic - and terrifying - choices. A scientist must turn against the benefactors she'd been trained to love. A heretic finds himself called upon to rally believers in a cause he never shared. And four youngsters from wildly different races find that what started as a simple adventure - imitating exploits they read about in Earthling books by Verne and Twain - will take them to the dark abyss of Jijo's ocean in search of answers...and then far beyond.Above all, this is the tale of Earth Survey Ship Streaker, with her fugitive dolphin crew, whose forlorn odyssey brought her at last to Jijo in desperate search of refuge. What she finds instead are secrets that have lain hidden since the spiral galaxies first burgeoned with intelligence; that may spell Jijo's salvation - or destruction; and that may unlock destiny, not just for Earthclan, but for all Five Galaxies.",

        "Description": "Norton's latest creation is a faraway dukedom rich in intoxicating aromas: powerful fragrances carried on gentle breezes, some with the capacity to enchant and befuddle, some capable even of toppling great leaders from their thrones. A scullery maid - an orphaned child - possesses an uncanny ability to sense and understand the magical odors that pervade her world; a talent/curse that carries young Willadene far from the fetid kitchen and a repulsive impending marriage, into an apprenticeship with a revered herbalist and, ultimately, to the highest circles of the Ducal court.But there is a malevolence lurking within the castle's walls, inspiring brazen treacheries and usurpations...and a foul abduction as unthinkable as it is unexpected. Something horribly strange and forbidden has struck at the dawn of a new day of corruption and terror. And a young girl finds the heightened sense that has been her fortune now drawing her inextricably down into a maelstrom of evil. Now a great quest is in Willadene's future: a journey to a place of darkness; of tainted covenants and ancient battles of blood and sacrifice when monsters warred with heroes. For the extraordinary power that has molded her destiny is propelling her toward shocking self-knowledge and an impossible rescue in a realm of shadows, secrets, and devastated hope where the invincible lord of abominations reigns.",

        "Title": "Douglas MacArthur: The Far Eastern General",
        "Authors": "By Schaller, Michael",
        "Description": "With his chiseled face, corn-cob pipe, and a voice which \"could trumpet and drum,\" General Douglas MacArthur looked the part of a \"heaven born general.\"  Although he became arguably the best-known and most flamboyant American military leader of the twentieth century, the men who served in the trenches of Bataan sneeringly referred to him as \"Dugout Doug.\"  FDR privately termed MacArthur's defense of Corregidor \"criminal,\" and Truman called his self-promoted \"return\" to the Philippines \"a fiasco.\"      This eye-opening book, written by one of America's leading authorities on United States-East Asian relations, offers an intimately detailed portrait of MacArthur, focusing particularly on the General's two decades in the Far East. Far from depicting him in a flattering light, Michael Schaller demythologizes the \"American Caesar,\" and along the way gives us an insightful analysis of American foreign policy in Asia during those years.      Revealing MacArthur's military failings, Schaller describes the costly consequences of MacArthur's indecisive Pacific Island campaign during World War II, which the popular press often hailed as brilliant.  He also examines MacArthur's three futile attempts at the presidency and his destructive interference in foreign policy--ranging from his manipulation of policies in occupied Japan and his constant attacks on Truman's policy in China, to the Korean War when the seventy-year-old general willfully risked war with China and the Soviet Union to salvage his pride and humiliate his political enemies in Washington.       This thought-provoking biography provides invaluable background to America's present relations with the Far East, as well as an unforgettable portrait of a man driven by talent, opportunism, vision, egotism, and jealousy.",
