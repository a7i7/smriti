When Oliver's mother  is  diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease and dies soon  thereafter, Oliver's father's  life is changed as  well. Braver than his son with less of a future  before him,  George Watson, at seventy-two, quickly  embraces new relationships and, eventually,  a new  life. The sudden changes come as a shock to both  father and son.   Ben,  Oliver's oldest  son, rejects his father and reaches outward, under  the illusion  that he is grown-up and can make it  on his own. Melissa, the middle child, blames   Oliver for her mother's desertion. And Sam, the  \"baby,\" is too shaken to deal with  it at all.  Now the only parent, Daddy must somehow cope this, his troubled family  and  explore a world of new responsibilities, new women,  and new experiences.  Each of the three  men must start a new life: Oliver in New York and  then in Los  Angeles with his children; once he  faces the biggest change in his life; his widowed   father with the woman next door; and  seventeen-year-old Ben with his girlfriend  and baby. Nothing is  as it was before... nothing is as they once  thought it would  be. But in the end, different is  better... different is more... for each of them\u2014and  especially for \"Daddy.\"",

        "Authors": "By Nesbett, Peter T. (EDT), Dubois, Michelle (EDT), and Hills, Patricia (EDT)",
        "Description": "Over the Line: The Art and Life of Jacob Lawrence includes essays by eight distinguished art historians examining the ways in which Jacob Lawrence\u2019s art speaks so powerfully to different audiences. It is the first multi-author, in-depth probe of the artist\u2019s entire career: the nature of his work, his education, the critical climate in which he worked, and his use of materials and techniques. It reproduces, in full color, more than 200 works, most of which have not been published in color, or at all, in other books on the artist.An extensive chronology, collating events in his life with his public reception -- including selected exhibitions, publications, honors, and awards -- is illustrated with family photographs. Jacob Lawrence (1917-2000) spent his childhood in New York City, attending classes at the Harlem Community Art Center and the American Artists School, and later working for the Federal Art Project. While still in his twenties Lawrence exhibited his paintings at major museums across the country, including the Phillips Collection, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where he became the first African American artist represented in the permanent collection. He lived, painted, and taught in New York City until 1971, when he moved to Seattle to join the faculty of the University of Washington. He was the recipient of numerous awards including the National Medal of Arts.The paperback edition of Over the Line is published in conjunction with a major exhibition opening at the Phillips Collection, Washington, DC, on May 26, 2001, and traveling to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.",

        "Title": "Earth: The Making, Shaping and Workings of a Planet",
        "Authors": "By Elsom, Derek",
        "Description": "In the last quarter century our knowledge of the forces that shape the Earth has grown exponentially, even as one of those forces - the behavior of humankind - has threatened the very survival of the planet. Never have we enjoyed greater understanding of earth sciences than we do now - and never has such an understanding been more important. This book serves as an extraordinary introduction to the way the Earth works. Splendidly illustrated, clearly written, it is a complete, up-to-date reference on the making, shaping and workings of the planet, providing essential background to any informed discussion of the critical environmental issues that face us today.From the semi-molten interior just four miles beneath the ocean floor to the protective atmosphere hundreds of miles above, Earth explores the origin and nature of the living planet we inhabit, along with its inner workings, life-supporting rhythms and surface features.Five major sections survey the planet. Planet Earth considers the cosmic connections that bind us to the universe and the powerhouse sun that feeds our living world. The Interior ventures beneath land and ocean into turbulent volcanic realms and the constantly shifting rock fabric of the planet. Shaping the Land describes the powerful forces that sculpt our landscape and coastlines. Beyond the Land reveals the entangled relationship of ocean and atmosphere, and the extremes of weather that result. Finally, How Long Can It Last? looks at the Earth's declining health as we exploit its resources and disrupt the cycles that bring it life.Spectacular examples from around the globe, sophisticated graphics, a vast array of photographs and the latest research are combined to explain the ever-changing physical environment around us - the oceans, mountains, deserts, frozen wastes - and the processes at work both within and around them. The result is both beautiful and essential - a book that no responsible Earth-dweller can be without.",

They run a storefront shop called Curious Notions, selling what is in our world routine consumer technology-record players, radios, cassette decks--all of which is better than anything in this world, but only by a bit. Their real job is to obtain raw materials for our timeline. Just as importantly, they must guard the secret of Crosstime Traffic--for of the millions of parallel timelines, this is one of the few advanced enough to use that secret against us.Now, however, the German occupation police are harassing them. They want to know where they're getting their mysterious goods. Under pressure, Paul and Lawrence hint that their supplies comes from San Francisco's Chinese...setting in motion a chain of intrigues that will put the entire enterprise of Crosstime Traffic at deadly risk.",

        "Title": "Hog Pilots, Blue Water Grunts: The American Military in the Air, at Sea, and on the Ground",
        "Authors": "By Kaplan, Robert D.",
        "Description": "In this extraordinary book, Robert D. Kaplan lets readers experience up close the American military worldwide in the air, at sea, and on the ground: flying in a B-2 bomber, living on a nuclear submarine, and traveling with a Stryker brigade on missions around the world. Provided unprecedented access, Kaplan moves from destroyers off the coast of Indonesia to submarines in the central Pacific, from simulated Iraqi training grounds in Alaska to technology bases in Las Vegas, from army and marine land forces in the heart of the Sahara Desert, to air bases in Guam and Thailand and beyond. Hog Pilots, Blue Water Grunts provides not only a riveting ground-level portrait of the Global War on Terrorism on several continents, but also a gritty firsthand account of how U.S. soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen are protecting sea-lanes, providing disaster relief, contending with the military rise of China, fighting the war in Iraq, and crafting contingency plans for war with North Korea and Iran. Expanding on Kaplan\u2019s acclaimed Imperial Grunts, the first volume of his exploration of the American military, which \u201coffers the reader an enlightened way to understand what is happening in the world\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle), Hog Pilots, Blue Water Grunts shifts focus to the Pacific, where emerging Asian powers present vexing diplomatic and strategic challenges to U.S. influence. In this volume, Kaplan completes his analysis of army Special Forces and the marines, while also taking readers into the heart of the myriad tribal cultures of the air force, surface and subsurface navies, and the regular army\u2019s Stryker brigades. Kaplan goes deep into their highly technical and exotic worlds, and he tells this story through the words and perspectives of the enlisted personnel and junior officers themselves\u2013men and women who, as he writes, have \u201chad their national identities as Americans engraved in sharp bas-relief.\u201d This provocative and illuminating book, like Imperial Grunts before it, not only conveys the vast scope of America\u2019s military commitments, which rarely make it into the news, but also shows us astonishing and vital operations right as they unfold\u2013from the point of view of the troops themselves.",

Open up this collection to view a wondrous array of optical effects: specks seem to move, grey spots appear and disappear, circles gyrate, patterns pulsate, and straight lines wave and bend. Shapes and drawings keep you from distinguishing what's there, and make you perceive things that aren't. Objects appear different from a distance than they do close up. They'll forever change the way you look at things.",
