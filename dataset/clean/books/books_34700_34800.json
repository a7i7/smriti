        "Title": "Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10",
        "Authors": "By Robinson, Patrick and Luttrell, Marcus",
        "Description": "A Navy SEAL's firsthand account of American heroism during a secret military operation in Afghanistan.Inspiration for a major motion picture by Mark Wahlberg.  On a clear night in late June 2005, four U.S. Navy SEALs left their base in northern Afghanistan for the mountainous Pakistani border. Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader known to be ensconced in a Taliban stronghold surrounded by a small but heavily armed force. Less then twenty-four hours later, only one of those Navy SEALs remained alive.  This is the story of fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the desperate battle in the mountains that led, ultimately, to the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history. But it is also, more than anything, the story of his teammates, who fought ferociously beside him until he was the last one left-blasted unconscious by a rocket grenade, blown over a cliff, but still armed and still breathing. Over the next four days, badly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell fought off six al Qaeda assassins who were sent to finish him, then crawled for seven miles through the mountains before he was taken in by a Pashtun tribe, who risked everything to protect him from the encircling Taliban killers. A six-foot-five-inch Texan, Leading Petty Officer Luttrell takes us, blow-by-blow, through the brutal training of America's warrior elite and the relentless rites of passage required by the Navy SEALs. He transports us to a monstrous battle fought in the desolate peaks of Afghanistan, where the beleaguered American team plummeted headlong a thousand feet down a mountain as they fought back through flying shale and rocks. In this rich , moving chronicle of courage, honor, and patriotism, Marcus Luttrell delivers one of the most powerful narratives ever written about modern warfare-and a tribute to his teammates, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.",

        "Title": "When Grief Breaks Your Heart",
        "Authors": "By Moore, James W.",
        "Description": "Every week there are members of your church who have experienced or are facing grief. Knowing what to do or how to help in these situations can be difficult. Pastors and church leaders are involved as supporters of the bereaved as they walk with persons through their grief.Grief affects everyone. When Grief Breaks Your Heart is an ideal resource for pastors, chaplains, other grief counselors, church leaders, and grief support groups to use and to give to those who have experienced a loss.Sadness, sorrow, disappointment, mourning, and grief are facts of life. People need help in knowing how to deal with grief, how to work through it, and how to grow because of it. In When Grief Breaks Your Heart, best-selling author James W. Moore explores two major questions: \u2022 What does faith say about the grief experience? \u2022 How does faith help mend a broken heart? The book, therefore, is about grief and grace. Moore shows how these two words belong together: \u2022 God\u2019s grace sustains people through the grief experience \u2022 God\u2019s love supports people when they have nowhere else to turn \u2022 God\u2019s grace brings the healing touch people so desperately need when their hearts are crushed. This book is appropriate for anyone who is experiencing grief. Pastors especially will find it helpful to keep a quantity on hand to give to people during grief experiences and grief counseling.Memorial books are a lasting and fitting tribute to individual contributors who have honored their loved ones. See the Related Products Section below.Check out books on the subject of grief and appropriate Bulletins. See some examples in the Related Products Section below.Did you know. . . Grief is the normal response of sorrow, emotion, and confusion that comes from losing someone important to you. The word \"grief\" comes from the same root as \"grave.\" Although many times focused only on emotional responses to loss, grief also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, and philosophical dimensions. Grief responses are influenced by personality, family, culture, and spiritual and religious beliefs and practices.While many who grieve may be able to work through their grief independently, accepting additional support from counseling and support groups may promote the process of healing.The Book of Ecclesiastes reminds us \"For everything there is a season...a time to weep, and a time to laugh;a time to mourn, and a time to dance...\"",

It isn't the danger that has Clint in a lather, but Julie herself. The pretty, petite schoolteacher he's been hired to return to her wealthy fianc\u00e9 is no fainting trust-fund baby. She's more of a hellcat, one who won't be deterred when she sets her sights on something. And her sights are set on Clint.The one rule Clint never breaks is this--don't get involved with the client. He can look, but he definitely cannot touch--even if it's driving him crazy. Keeping Julie safe until he can figure out who's behind her kidnapping means never letting her out of his sight. And the closer he sticks to the feisty, seductive woman who makes him feel alive...the harder it gets for him to ever consider letting her go...\"Foster writes smart, sexy, engaging characters.\"--Christine Feehan\"A Lori Foster book is like a glass of good champagne--sexy and sparkling.\"--Jayne Ann Krentz",

Perspectives in the book touch on social interactions between students and teachers, the psychology of power struggles, and standards of behavior. Many of the shared stories are common ground between the authors and the reader. This book serves the teacher well. With educators as the target readers, Fay and Funk's book encourages teachers to try the 'Love and Logic' approach. For the seasoned teachers who find that the passion of teaching has been eroded away by the ever-changing dynamics of student populations this book is a must. For aspiring educators, this book would serve as a fundamental tool to hold dear through decades to come. Fay and Funk's ideas are fundamental to teaching--changes in time, structure, and students do not alter the messages in this book. The book is a tool that in its first reading presents a fresh outlook for teaching. Consecutive readings hone the teachers' skills to establish the environment needed for educators to educate and students to learn.",

Yet in the terror following the attack by deadly U-boats, the chaplains united in a final sacrifice that transformed every survivor who saw it-and inspired one man to trade the bitterness of the past for the promise of the future.",

        "Title": "A History of the Supreme Court",
        "Authors": "By Schwartz, Bernard",
        "Description": "When the first Supreme Court convened in 1790, it was so ill-esteemed that its justices frequently resigned in favor of other pursuits. John Rutledge stepped down as Associate Justice to become a state judge in South Carolina; John Jay resigned as Chief Justice to run for Governor of New York; and Alexander Hamilton declined to replace Jay, pursuing a private law practice instead.  As Bernard Schwartz shows in this landmark history, the Supreme Court has indeed travelled a long and interesting journey to its current preeminent place in American life.   In A History of the Supreme Court, Schwartz provides the finest, most comprehensive one-volume narrative ever published of our highest court.  With impeccable scholarship and a clear, engaging style, he tells the story of the justices and their jurisprudence--and the influence the Court has had on American politics and society.  With a keen ability to explain complex legal issues for the nonspecialist, he takes us through both the great and the undistinguished Courts of our nation's history.  He provides insight into our foremost justices, such as John Marshall (who established judicial review in Marbury v. Madison, an outstanding display of political calculation as well as fine jurisprudence), Roger Taney (whose legacy has been overshadowed by Dred Scott v. Sanford), Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, and others.  He draws on evidence such as personal letters and interviews to show how the court has worked, weaving narrative details into deft discussions of the developments in constitutional law.  Schwartz also examines the operations of the court: until 1935, it met in a small room under the Senate--so cramped that the judges had to put on their robes in full view of the spectators.  But when the new building was finally opened, one justice called it \"almost bombastically pretentious,\" and another asked, \"What are we supposed to do, ride in on nine elephants?\"  He includes fascinating asides, on the debate in the first Court, for instance, over the use of English-style wigs and gowns (the decision: gowns, no wigs); and on the day Oliver Wendell Holmes announced his resignation--the same day that Earl Warren, as a California District Attorney, argued his first case before the Court. The author brings the story right up to the present day, offering balanced analyses of the pivotal Warren Court and the Rehnquist Court through 1992 (including, of course, the arrival of Clarence Thomas).       In addition, he includes four special chapters on watershed cases: Dred Scott v. Sanford, Lochner v. New York, Brown v. Board of Education, and Roe v. Wade.  Schwartz not only analyzes the impact of each of these epoch-making cases, he takes us behind the scenes, drawing on all available evidence to show how the justices debated the cases and how they settled on their opinions.      Bernard Schwartz is one of the most highly regarded scholars of the Supreme Court, author of dozens of books on the law, and winner of the American Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award.  In this remarkable account, he provides the definitive one-volume account of our nation's highest court.",
