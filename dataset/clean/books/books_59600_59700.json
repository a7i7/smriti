        "Description": "It is 1942. Germany controls almost the entire resources of continental Europe and is poised to move into the Middle East. Japan has wiped out the western colonial presence in East Asia in a couple of months and is threatening northern India and Australia. The Soviet Union has lost the heart of its industry, and the United States is not yet armed. Democracy has had its day.The Allied victory in 1945 has since come to seem inevitable. It was not. In Richard Overy's incisive analysis, we see exactly how the Allies regained military superiority and why they were able to do it. Overy offers a brilliant analysis of the decisive campaigns: the war at sea, the crucial battles on the eastern front, the air war, and the vast amphibious assault on Europe. The eastern front was critical. Having lost four million men and tens of thousands of tanks and aircraft in the first six months of fighting, the Soviet Union was able to relocate its industrial base to the east, intensify its industrial production, and defeat the German forces at Stalingrad and Kursk. This was the turning point, the victory of one authoritarian system over another.Overy also explores the deeper factors affecting military success and failure: industrial strength, fighting ability, the quality of leadership, and the moral dimensions of the war.",

Reengineering goes beyond continuous improvement \"Continuous improvement is exactly the right idea if you are the world leader it is probably a disastrous idea if you are far behind in the world standard we need rapid, quantum-leap improvement. We cannot be satisfied to lay out a plan that will move us towards the existing world standard over some protracted period of time if we accept such a plan; we will never be the world leader.\" Paul O Neill, Chairman ALCOA",

When Francophile Alice Waters opened Chez Panisse in Berkeley in 1971, few Americans were familiar with goat cheese, cappuccino, or mesclun. But it wasn't long before Waters and her motley coterie of dreamers inspired a new culinary standard incorporating ethics, politics, and the conviction that the best-grown food is also the tastiest. Based on unprecedented access to Waters and her inner circle, this is a truly delicious rags-to-riches saga.",

In 1967, the Chinese destroyed monasteries across Tibet and forced thousands of monks into labor camps and prisons.

But, ironically, so was my later journey to God.'---Lee Strobel During his academic years, Lee Strobel became convinced that God was outmoded, a belief that colored his ensuing career as an award-winning journalist at the Chicago Tribune. Science had made the idea of a Creator irrelevant---or so Strobel thought. But today science is pointing in a different direction. In recent years, a diverse and impressive body of research has increasingly supported the conclusion that the universe was intelligently designed. At the same time, Darwinism has faltered in the face of concrete facts and hard reason. Has science discovered God? At the very least, it's giving faith an immense boost as new findings emerge about the incredible complexity of our universe. Join Strobel as he reexamines the theories that once led him away from God. Through his compelling and highly readable account, you'll encounter the mind-stretching discoveries from cosmology, cellular biology, DNA research, astronomy, physics, and human consciousness that present astonishing evidence in The Case for a Creator.

        "Authors": "By McPherson, James M., Kunstler, Mort, and Kunstler, Mort (ILT)",
        "Description": "In July 1863, as the Confederate army approached the crossroads village of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the prospect of victory for the South appeared bright. With morale low among the Union army in the wake of a succession of defeats, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Army Commander Robert E. Lee saw an opportunity to win a decisive battle on Union soil. After three bloody days, however, one-third of Lee's army had been killed or wounded, and Lee was forced to retreat to Virginia. This major loss, considered to be the Civil War's turning point, became the first of many Union victories that ultimately led to Appomattox and complete Confederate defeat.With dramatic text and pictures, Gettysburg humanizes this crucial battle: the thoughts, emotions, and actions of the men who commanded, fought, and died there. As Abraham Lincoln said four months after the battle, those who died at Gettysburg gave their last full measure of devotion that the nation might experience a new birth of freedom. This is the story of those brave men.",

        "Description": "The New York Times bestselling financial guide aimed squarely  at \"Generation Debt\"\u2014and their parents\u2014from the country's most trusted  and dynamic source on money matters. The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous & Broke is  financial expert Suze Orman's answer to a generation's cry for help.  They're called \"Generation Debt\" and \"Generation Broke\" by the media \u2014  people in their twenties and thirties who graduate college with a  mountain of student loan debt and are stuck with one of the weakest job  markets in recent history. The goals of their parents' generation \u2014 buy a  house, support a family, send kids to college, retire in style \u2014 seem  absurdly, depressingly out of reach. They live off their credit cards,  may or may not have health insurance, and come up so far short at the  end of the month that the idea of saving money is a joke. This  generation has it tough, without a doubt, but they're also painfully  aware of the urgent need to take matters into their own hands. The Money Book was written to address the specific financial  reality that faces young people today and offers a set of real, not  impossible solutions to the problems at hand and the problems ahead.  Concisely, pragmatically, and without a whiff of condescension, Suze  Orman tells her young, fabulous & broke readers precisely what  actions to take and why. Throughout these pages, there are icons that  direct readers to a special YF&B domain on Suze's website that  offers more specialized information, forms, and interactive tools that  further customize the information in the book. Her advice at times bucks  conventional wisdom (did she just say use your credit card?) and may  even seem counter-intuitive (pay into a retirement fund even though your  credit card debt is killing you?), but it's her honesty, understanding,  and uncanny ability to anticipate the needs of her readers that has  made her the most trusted financial expert of her day.Over the course of ten chapters that can be consulted methodically,  step-by-step or on a strictly need-to-know basis, Suze takes the reader  past broke to a secure place where they'll never have to worry about  revisiting broke again. And she begins the journey with a bit of  overwhelmingly good news (yes, there really is good news): Young people  have the greatest asset of all on their side \u2014 time.",

        "Description": "In the year 2060, cutting-edge investigative tools can help catch a killer. But there are some questions even the most advanced technologies cannot answer ...At the most solemn moment of a Catholic funeral Mass, the priest brings the chalice to his lips. Seconds later, he is dead on the altar. For the mourners packed into the pews, Father Miguel Flores's sudden demise is an unimaginable shock. When Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas confirms that the consecrated wine contained enough potassium cyanide to kill a rhino, she's prepared to plunge in and find out why, despite her discomfort with her surroundings. It's not the bodegas and pawnshops of East Harlem that bother her, though the neighborhood is a long way from the stone mansion she shares with her billionaire husband, Roarke. It's all that holiness flying around at St. Cristobal's that makes her uneasy.A search of the victim's simple, sparsely furnished room reveals few personal touches, except for a carefully hidden religious medal with a mysterious inscription, and a couple of underlined Bible passages. The autopsy reveals much more: faint scars of knife wounds, a removed tattoo - and evidence of plastic surgery suggesting \"Father Flores\" may not have been the man his parishioners thought. Now, as Eve pieces together clues that suggest identity theft, gang connections, and a deeply personal act of revenge, she hopes to track down whoever committed this unholy act. Until a second murder - in front of an even larger crowd of worshippers - knocks the whole investigation sideways.The way Eve sees it, vengeance may be the Lord's business, but if there's going to be any earthly justice in this case, it's up to her.",

And somehow she always happens to be involved in some of the twistiest, most challenging crime scenes imaginable. This time around she's called in to investigate what appears to be a locked-room mystery: A wealthy woman is murdered in the penthouse suite of a luxurious, high-security building. The building's intricate surveillance system didn't pick up anything, the entrance wasn't forced, and the victim's husband has an airtight alibi. Cases like this, Evelyn knows, can turn on the most microscopic piece of evidence--if she can find any. Things look even trickier when another victim turns up in another penthouse suite. Then Evelyn's best friend is attacked--and things get personal. And when a third person is found dead, Evelyn realizes that the killer's choice of victim is anything but random. . . .",

Woven into her plot is an eerie, little-understood but documented medical phenomenon -- the emergence of a donor's traits and memories in the recipient of a heart transplant.Natalie Raines, one of Broadway's brightest stars, accidentally discovers who killed her former roommate and sets in motion a series of shocking events that puts more than one life in extreme peril.While Natalie and her roommate, Jamie Evans, were both struggling young actresses, Jamie had been involved with a mysterious married man to whom she referred only by nickname. Natalie comes face to face with him years later and inadvertently addresses him by the nickname Jamie had used. A few days later, Natalie is found in her home in Closter, New Jersey, dying from a gunshot wound.Immediately the police suspect Natalie's theatrical agent and soon-to-be-ex-husband, Gregg Aldrich. He had long been a \"person of interest\" and was known to have stalked Natalie to find out if she was seeing another man. But no charges are brought against him until two years later, when Jimmy Easton, a career criminal, suddenly comes forward to claim that Aldrich had tried to hire him to kill his wife. Easton knows details about the Aldrich home that only someone who had been there -- to plan a murder, for instance -- could possibly know.The case is a plum assignment for Emily Wallace, an attractive thirty-two-year-old assistant prosecutor. As she spends increasingly long hours preparing for the trial, a seemingly well-meaning neighbor offers to take care of her dog in her absence. Unaware of his violent past, she gives him a key to her home...As Aldrich's trial is making headlines, her boss warns Emily that this high-profile case will reveal personal matters about her, such as the fact that she had a heart transplant. And, during the trial, Emily experiences sentiments that defy all reason and continue after Gregg Aldrich's fate is decided by the jury.In the meantime, she does not realize that her own life is now at risk.A compelling novel that probes the mysteries of the human heart and mind, Just Take My Heart is Mary Higgins Clark's most spellbinding tale.",

        "Description": "In this authoritative book, renowned U. S. News & World Report religion writer Jeffery L. Sheler sifts through the claims and counterclaims of contemporary biblical studies.  After carefully investigating the full spectrum of cutting-edge research and conflicting reports, he challenges the popular perception that the credibility of the Bible has been seriously undermined by critical scholarship.  Rather, he concludes that the weight of the historical evidence upholds the essential truth of the Exodus, the Gospel accounts of Jesus, and other vital elements of the Bible.The author draws extensively from his own interviews with leading Bible experts and on-site reports from Israel and Egypt in his examination of scholarship's hot-button issues, including:Dramatic archaeological discoveries that both affirm and challenge the history in the BibleThe controversial quest for the historical Jesus and its sometimes flawed arguments and skeptical assumptions regarding the reliability of the GospelsThe amazing revelations of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient texts that profoundly influence our understanding of the BibleThe mysterious phenomenon of The Bible Code and why there may be far less to its doomsday prophecies than meets the eyeSheler's considerable experience as a leading religion journalist enables him to get to the heart of the issues without the jargon.  Written in clear, compelling prose, Is the Bible True? presents a sophisticated analysis--informed by important scholarly work--in lucid, accessible terms.",

The monks were on food stamps. An ancient order was about to go belly-up.Then, one fateful day, Brother Ty decided to let God be his broker - and not only saved the monastery but discovered the 7-1/2 Laws of Spiritual and Financial Growth.Brother Ty's remarkable success has been studied at the nation's leading business schools and scrutinized by Wall Street's greatest minds, but the secret to the miracle is not to be found in any management analysis. The answer lies in the ancient texts used by the monks. Now, for the first time, Brother Ty reveals the secrets he found in those texts - complete with chapter and verse citations - and tells how you can get God to be your broker. But even more important than the money you'll make is the inner peace that you will achieve. Each chapter ends with a lesson and Market Meditation that will tell you whether to buy or sell, plus a \"host\" of other self-improvement strategies.",

Like football players in the \u201cred zone,\u201d they are struggling to complete the drive toward integrity and intimacy with God. That drive toward spiritual maturity requires both a shift of heart and a re-examination of the spiritual habits. What men lack today is, first, clear understanding of what God is really after in the relationship, and second, a clear plan connected to their goals that make sense practically and biblically. That\u2019s what makes this book special: It specifically reveals God\u2019s heart for men in the spiritual \u201cred zone,\u201d and sets forth the choices they must make to take the relationship with God all the way.Like other books in the \u201cEvery Man\u201d Series, Every Man, God\u2019s Man boldly gets into men\u2019s heads and gives hope. It helps them persevere in their pursuit of God. Provides new insight into God\u2019s objectives for them.

Scarcely less at risk, Matthew, an officer in England\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service, fights the war covertly from London. Only Hannah, living with her children in the family home in tranquil Cambridgeshire, seems safe.Appearances, however, are deceiving. By the time Joseph returns home to Cambridgeshire, rumors of spies and traitors are rampant. And when the savagely brutalized body of a weapons scientist is discovered in a village byway, the fear that haunts the battlefields settles over the town\u2013along with the shadow of the obsessed ideologue who murdered the Reavleys\u2019 parents on the eve of the war. Once again, this icy, anonymous powerbroker, the Peacemaker, is plotting to kill.Perry\u2019s kaleidoscopic new novel illuminates an entire world, from the hell of the trenches to the London nightclub where a beautiful Irish spy plies her trade; from the sequestered laboratory where a weapon that can end the war is being perfected to the matchless glory of the English countryside in spring. Steeped in history and radiant with truth, Angels in the Gloom is a masterpiece that warms the heart even as it chills the blood.From the Hardcover edition.",

Now she returns with a bracing new novel, at once an intricate mystery and a rich human drama set in the high-stakes atmosphere of a prestigious research institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Sandy Glass, a charismatic publicity-seeking oncologist, and Marion Mendelssohn, a pure, exacting scientist, are codirectors of a lab at the Philpott Institute dedicated to cancer research and desperately in need of a grant.  Both mentors and supervisors of their young postdoctoral prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Glass and Mendelssohn demand dedication and obedience in a competitive environment where funding is scarce and results elusive.  So when the experiments of Cliff Bannaker, a young postdoc in a rut, begin to work, the entire lab becomes giddy with newfound expectations.  But Cliff\u2019s rigorous colleague\u2013and girlfriend\u2013Robin Decker suspects the unthinkable: that his findings are fraudulent.  As Robin makes her private doubts public and Cliff maintains his innocence, a life-changing controversy engulfs the lab and everyone in it. With extraordinary insight, Allegra Goodman brilliantly explores the intricate mixture of workplace intrigue, scientific ardor, and the moral consequences of a rush to judgment.
