        "Description": "Our front pages scream US military, social and fiscal policy. It may appear that \u2014 with immigration questions, airport and border restrictions, debate about common currency and talk of private health clinics \u2014 we are drifting inevitably towards a greater political and philosophical alliance with the United States. The implication is that we share their values. As Canadians, we have long defined ourselves as \u201cnot Americans.\u201d We cherish our differences from our powerful neighbour but, as the United States grows ever more dominant on the world stage, can we hope to hold on to our national identity? Are we fated to become Americans in a generation or two? In Fire and Ice, Michael Adams challenges the myth of inevitability that has led us to believe our Canadian way of life is doomed to extinction. Drawing upon a decade of never-before released pulse-taking from both sides of the border, he reveals that Canada and the United States are not coming together, but are diverging in significant ways. From the vehicles we buy to the deference we pay to authority, Canadians prove to be firmly separate in their attitudes and opinions. If you have ever wondered whether Canada can survive and prosper as a distinct society in an era of globalization and dizzying technological change, Fire and Ice provides fascinating evidence that the cultural divergence between our country and the United States will continue for years to come.",

        "Description": "The wizard saved his greatest spell for last.  Tristen is the name of that Shaping, and Tristen knows nothing else for certain: Neither who he was, nor what he is, nor least of all why the wizard created him.And now the wizard is dead. And young Cefwyn is King. Cefwyn has a dream: A united Ylesuin, and a peace his land has never known. It is a dream that persists in spite of a court bent on ruling the King... self-serving barons who abhor wizards and foreigners.Hide your powers, the King asks Tristen. Cefwyn needs his only friend, this young man of mysterious origins who is more brother than vassal. He relies on Tristen, trusts him, protects him... and plans for a war that will bring his dreams to pass... or bring down ruin upon them all.And so a sword gathers dust in a corner of Tristen&#39;s room. One side says Truth. The other side says Illusion. The servants refuse to touch it... and Tristen ignores it with all his might.The eagerly awaited sequel to her acclaimed Fortress in the Eye of Time, C.J. Cherryh&#39;s newest high fantasy triumph continues the soaring tale of two friends, sovereign and sorcerer, in an age of wizardry. Fortress of Eagles is a legend in the making, an epic saga of destiny and ancient magic, an intimate tale of love and loyalty in a magical world spanning centuries.",

        "Description": "A revolutionary, twelve-week program to take you to the top level of fitness and wellness from \"one of the fittest men on earth\" (CNN International).  Sean Burch started out with a lofty goal: to climb Mount Everest solo and without supplementary oxygen. To accomplish this, Sean developed a training regimen that incorporated cardio and strength elements, nutrition, and mental conditioning. That program took him to Everest's summit and helped launch his career as one of the world's premier athletes. He is now considered an \"American Fitness Guru\" (Men's Journal) and sought after for his unique techniques and his contagious enthusiasm.  Hyperfitness means learning to test and challenge yourself every day. It means setting short-term and long-range goals and achieving them. It means pushing yourself and discovering that you are stronger, tougher, and more capable than you ever dreamed. With Sean's three building blocks to success-hyperstrength (exercise), hyperfare (nutrition), and hypermind (mental conditioning)-you can accomplish any physical and mental goal you can imagine in twelve short weeks.  But what sets this fitness book apart is Sean Burch's incredible personal story and his encouraging, no-holds-barred motivational approach. With such creative daily exercises as speed skater drills, aerial spins, scale the whale, and ski-mogul master jumps clearly illustrated throughout, the workouts are more like obstacle courses-challenging, varied, and fun. Whether you are preparing for a marathon or another event, or are just ready to dedicate yourself to getting in the best shape of your life physically and mentally, Hyperfitness will inspire you to reach the highest level of yourself possible.",

But nothing is as L\u00e9onie had imagined. Their aunt is young, willowy, and beautiful, and the estate is a subject of local superstition.

Each of 24 chapters introduces 15 new words, first placing the words in a brief essay that allows students to comprehend them in a given context. \u201cBrain Tickler\u201d questions that follow challenge students and help them determine whether they have gained some mastery of word usage. Sidebars appear on many pages with titles such as \u201cMajor Mistake Territory,\u201d alerting students to possible pitfalls and problems involving correct understanding of word meanings and normal usage. Each chapter concludes with an \u201cOn Your Own\u201d section, which invites students to use the target vocabulary list within the context of their own everyday speech. Morbid. . . furtively . . . predecessor . . . infer . . . are typical examples of words students will learn to use with ease. The book\u2019s vocabulary is neither too easy nor too arcane\u2014focusing instead on words that students should have at their command in high-school and by the time they enter college.",
