From his first consciousness of the \"little green room\" he finds himself in - the safe comfortable home that is his starting point - and his meeting with the guides who help him on his journey - this afterlife is a place both of wonder and familiarity.For as with every journey we face, the journey through the afterlife can be easy or difficult, an adventure or a trial. Daniel meets spirits who cannot escape the bounds their earthly life set out for them, and who continue to make the afterlife their own little hell. And Daniel learns that in order to do the work of God himself, one still must live well with others.Dr. Peck's In Heaven as on Earth can be read in several ways: It is a stirring work of imagination - a novel that gives us a fascinating view of what the afterlife may bring. It is also a profound book about the self - a book in which we come to see that Dr. Peck's vision of how to thrive in the afterlife can teach us important things about living our own lives here on Earth.",

Magueijo (theoretical physics, Imperial College, UK) has sought to resolve this and other contradictions of physics by controversially suggesting that the speed of light is in fact not an Einsteinian constant, but is instead a variable. Writing for a lay audience, he explains some of the implications of his theory, describes the path that led him to his conclusions, and discusses the reactions of the scientific community and others to his idea.

        "Description": "Why do Europeans and Americans see the world so differently? Why do Europeans and Americans have such different understandings of democracy in the twenty-first century? Why is Europe dying, demographically? In The Cube and the Cathedral, George Weigel offers a penetrating critique of \"Europe's problem\" and draws out its lessons for the rest of the democratic world. Contrasting the civilization that produced the starkly modernist \"cube\" of the Great Arch of La Defense in Paris with the civilization that produced the \"cathedral,\" Notre-Dame, Weigel argues that Europe's embrace of a narrow and cramped secularism has led to a crisis of civilizational morale that is eroding Europe's soul and failing to create the European future. Even as thoughtful Europeans and Americans wrestle with these grave issues, many European political leaders continue to insist-most recently, during the debate over a new European constitution-that only a public square shorn of religiously informed moral argument is safe for human rights and democracy. The most profound question raised by The Cube and the Cathedral is whether there can be any true \"politics\"-any true deliberation about the common good, and any robust defense of freedom-without God. George Weigel makes a powerful case that the answer is \"No\"-because, in the final analysis, societies and cultures can only be as great as their spiritual aspirations.",

        "Description": "A full year before the presidential election, four Newsweek reporters are detached from the magazine to work fulltime on getting inside the campaigns of the Republican and Democratic candidates. Because Newsweek promises not to reveal any information until after the votes are cast, the reporters receive highly unusual access. They travel with the candidates, live at their headquarters, befriend their staffs. They blend into the background, where they watch  and listen.     Evan Thomas has been the writer for this project for the last three elections, and each time, he has brilliantly woven together an award-winning narrative of the campaign,based on the reporting of the Newsweek team. The goal is a rich narrative, a telling, human, and personal  story of the extraordinary ordeal of running for the presidency. The characters are the candidates, their families, and their top advisers. They battle uncertainty, exhaustion,  a hostile media, and each other in a high-stakes contest that can produce only one winner. The 2004 election promised to be drama of a high order, a close, tense, bitter struggle in a deeply divided country caught in a strange and  hard war. Newsweek's reporters were there at the critical moments, recording the scenes that decided the outcome.    Post election, the Newsweek team will now produce an expanded version of the stories that appeared in the magazine and Thomas will write an essay on the new administration, its key players and its prospects, the tone and direction it is expected to set. The book that emerges will be a first draft of history\u2014not rough\u2014but knowing and  deeply reported.",

One-Up Trivia asks the questions that go beyond any other trivia game or quiz. It gives you not only the follow-up question to a \"known\" fact, but the answer and then some. You'll have trivia and true stories to share with and impress friends through many get-togethers! Get a leg up on the competition, and beat those so-called trivia buffs at their own game. Take trivia to the next level! Time: September 30, 1955, 5:59 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. Place: California Route 466 near Cholane at the 'Y' intersection with Route 41. Action: A brand new, silver Porsche Spyder 550, traveling at 85 mph crashes into a five year old, black and white Ford Custom Tudor coupe. Driver #1: At the wheel of the Porsche was rebel-without-a-cause, James Dean. The one-up: Who was Driver #2 in the Ford? Donald Turnupseed, a college student. Unlike Dean, he survived the crash. The Ford was repairable, but Dean's Porsche was described as \"crumpled up like an empty cigarette pack.\" No charges were laid. Was the Porsche a jinx car? Dean's friends had talked of it giving them a bad feeling, well before the accident and the strange things that followed it. When the ruined Porsche was stripped for parts, the engine went to professional racer, Troy McHenry. He totaled in his next event. Another racer, William Eschrid, installed the drive train: next race, same thing. A third collector bought the front tires; both blew out on the same trip. California Highway Patrol bought the shell to use as a drive-safely-or-else exhibit for teenagers. It fell off its pedestal...onto a Sacramento high school student.",

In the course of a single dramatic season, with euphoric wins and devastating losses, we come to know the intricacies of the major league scouting network and the rapidly changing profile of major league baseball.In the tradition ofThe Boys of Summer, The Last Best League is about dreams fulfilled and dreams denied, about Cape Cod and the rites of summer, and about the way one small town grows to love a group of young men coming of age in America.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Companion to the English Language",
        "Authors": "By McArthur, Tom (EDT)",
        "Description": "Language is the life blood of a culture, and to be interested in culture is in some sense to be interested in language, in the shapes and sounds of words, in the history of reading, writing, and speech, in the endless variety of dialects and slangs, in the incessant creativity of the human mind as it reaches out to others. It is surprising then that until now there has been no major one-volume reference devoted to the most widely dispersed and influential language of our time: the English language.     A language-lover's dream, The Oxford Companion to the English Language is a thousand-page cornucopia covering virtually every aspect of the English language as well as language in general. The range of topics is remarkable, offering a goldmine of information on writing and speech (including entries on grammar, literary terms, linguistics, rhetoric, and style) as well as on such wider issues as sexist language, bilingual education, child language acquisition, and the history of English. There are biographies of Shakespeare, Noah Webster, Noam Chomsky, James Joyce, and many others who have influenced the shape or study of the language; extended articles on everything from psycholinguistics to sign language to tragedy; coverage of every nation in which a significant part of the population speaks English as well as virtually every regional dialect and pidgin (from Gullah and Scouse to Cockney and Tok Pisin). In addition, the Companion provides bibliographies for the larger entries, generous cross-referencing, etymologies for headwords, a chronology of English from Roman times to 1990, and an index of people who appear in entries or bibliographies. And like all Oxford Companions, this volume is packed with delightful surprises. We learn, for instance, that the first Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard later became President (John Quincy Adams); that \"slogan\" originally meant \"war cry\"; that the keyboard arrangement QWERTY became popular not because it was efficient but the opposite (it slows down the fingers and keeps them from jamming the keys); that \"mbenzi\" is Swahili for \"rich person\" (i.e., one who owns a Mercedes Benz); and that in Scotland, \"to dree yir ain weird\" means \"to follow your own star.\"     From Scrabble to Websters to TESOL to Gibraltar, the thirty-five hundred entries here offer more information on a wider variety of topics than any other reference on the English language. Featuring the work of nearly a hundred scholars from around the world, this unique volume is the ideal shelf-mate to The Oxford Companion to English Literature. It will captivate everyone who loves language.",

His slow progress toward certain execution is nearing completion when Arthur Raven, a corporate lawyer who is Rommy's reluctant court-appointed representative, receives word that another inmate may have new evidence that will exonerate Gandolph.Arthur's opponent in the case is Muriel Wynn, Kindle County's formidable chief deputy prosecuting attorney, who is considering a run for her boss's job. Muriel and Larry Starczek, the original detective on the case, don't want to see Rommy escape a fate they long ago determined he deserved, for a host of reasons. Further complicating the situation is the fact that Gillian Sullivan, the judge who originally found Rommy guilty, is only recently out of prison herself, having served time for taking bribes.Scott Turow's compelling, multi-dimensional characters take the reader into Kindle County's parallel yet intersecting worlds of police and small-time crooks, airline executives and sophisticated scammers--and lawyers of all stripes. No other writer offers such a convincing true-to-life picture of how the law and life interact, or such a profound understanding of what is at stake--personally, professionally, and morally--when the state holds the power to end a man's life.",

        "Description": "Morgan Siler is one of Washington, D.C.'s most powerful K Street law firms, its roster of clients stocked with multi-billion-dollar corporations. Through the obsessive efforts of its founder's son, Peter Morgan, his father's old-fashioned business has been transformed into a veritable goliath, embracing bankruptcy and merger divisions that Archibald Morgan had deemed ungentlemanly. As Peter reaches the pinnacle of his career, his firm is embroiled in two difficult cases: a pro bono death-penalty case in Virginia, and a class-action lawsuit brought against Hubble Chemical of Texas after an on-site explosion killed dozens of workers. Assigned to these cases is a group of young associates and seasoned partners struggling to make their way in the firm. Mark Clayton, fresh out of law school, is beginning to loathe his dull workload, and to be frightened by the downgrading of his personal life, when he is assigned to the pro bono case. Assisting him is the mercurial Walker Eliot, a brilliant third-year associate whose passion for the law is as great as his skill at unraveling its intricacies. The aggressive, profane, and wildly successful litigator Harold Fineman is leading the Hubble defense, assisted by first-year Katja Phillips, whose twin devotion to productivity and idealism intrigue him, and Ryan Grady, another first-year, whose quest to pick up girls is starting to interfere with his work.In this complex, ambitious, and gripping first novel, Kermit Roosevelt vividly illustrates the subtle and stark effects of the law on the lives not only of a group of lawyers, but also on communities and private citizens. In the Shadow of the Law is a meditation about the life of the law, the organism that is a law firm, and its impact on those who come within its powerful orbit.",

Though millions of people manage to cook, care for children, or work despite their disability, they do so with fatigue, pain, and the grinding uncertainty of living with chronic illness.A thoughtful exploration of this experience, A Delicate Balance provides both up-to-date practical advice and inspiration for the millions of Americans who struggle daily against chronic illness. From locating a suitable health-care provider and making sense of the powerful emotions that accompany chronic illness, to seeking accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and applying for Social Security Disability Insurance, A Delicate Balance is informed by in-depth, personal interviews with patients, care providers, and family members. The result is a compassionate and immensely hopeful book for anyone touched by a chronic disease.",

Although it goes against his instincts to do so, he must hire an assistant to help him with his increasingly complicated professional and personal affairs. Considering at first only male applicants, he is dissatisfied with everyone he meets. Then one day at the bookstore he encounters Alma. A young woman with synthetic-looking blond hair and pale, tattooed skin, she stirs something inside Seigl -- pity? desire? responsibility? Though he's uncertain why, he decides she is the one -- she will be his assistant. Unaware of her torturous past -- the abuses she's suffered, the wrongs she's committed, and the hatred that seethes within her -- he has no idea that he is bringing into his home an enemy: an anti-Semite who despises him virulently and unquestioningly. Seigl allows Alma more and more deeply into his life, mindless of the danger she presents. Yet their closeness forces Seigl and Alma to make discoveries that cut to the core of their identities.With her unique, masterful balance of dark suspense and surprising tenderness, Joyce Carol Oates probes the tragedy of ethnic hatred and challenges accepted limits of desire.",

        "Description": "Lighthearted and altogether fascinating, When in Rome is a delightful backstairs tour of one of the world's most mysterious and eccentric cities. With his wife and three young sons, Robert Hutchinson moved to Rome shortly before his thirty-ninth birthday, intending to explore the Vatican in depth. He sought to capture \"the personality of the place: the smells and the traffic, the rich delicacies of Roman food, the perils of the Italian language, the way Italian monsignori push their way to the front of the line, just like their lay countrymen.\" When in Rome is the extraordinary journal of his Roman sojourn.With playful good humor, Hutchinson introduces the varied and colorful individuals who live and work in the Vatican. In the process, he explores the mysterious orders of medieval knights, some dating back to the First Crusade, which still play a vital role in the Vatican; explains how bumbling Vatican archaeologists found, and then lost, the bones of St. Peter; probes the sex lives of the popes, from the \"pornocracy\" of Sergius III to the incestuous orgies of Rodrigo Borgia; experiences high fashion in the Holy See, including a visit to the pope's personal tailor; encounters the weird relics of Catholicism, such as the mummified body of St. Pius X and a museum made entirely out of human bones; recounts the true story behind the True Cross, now kept in a run-down church near the Colosseum; and much, much more.Humorous, irreverent, but ultimately respectful, When in Rome does for the Vatican what A Year in Provence did for the French countryside, in an unforgettable and unprecedented eyewitness account of one of the most fascinating places on Earth.",

        "Authors": "By Bernstein, Michael Andre",
        "Description": "Galicia, Austria-Hungary, 1913. In the castle of a frontier town, on the border between Europe and the East, the worldly, corrupt Count-Governor Wiladowski watches helplessly while a wave of assassinations sweeps the empire, and his province. When a member of his own family is murdered, the count gives broad police powers to his spymaster, Jakob Tausk: a brilliant young Jew whose ruthless war on terror extends into every corner of the province and beyond, enlisting union organizers, financiers, aristocrats and their servants, and a young novelist and playwright, newly arrived in the Vienna of Franz Josef and Freud, hungry for literary success.In the wake of new terrorist attacks, a mysterious preacher appears in the provincial capital--one of the so-called \"wonder rabbis\" from the shtetls of the East-trailing a band of fanatical disciples who proclaim him the messiah. Word of the charismatic leader spreads quickly from the Jewish quarter to the castle itself, and soon Tausk finds himself serving two masters: the count and the richest man in the province, Moritz Rotenburg, who has a private interest in the wonder rabbi and whose only son has returned from university, burning for revolution, to gather disciples of his own.Moving from underground meetings and makeshift synagogues to the bedrooms of country estates and the secret high councils of the ailing thousand-year-old Habsburg Empire, Michael Andr\u00e9 Bernstein's compelling first novel evokes a densely believable world on the edge of collapse, full of the haunting suggestiveness of a fable or nightmare, and the erotic, mystical, and apocalyptic passions of an age.",

All Angel wanted was to be movie-star blond, change her name, and get as much attention as her prettier older sister Lina.Now Angel is nearing thirty, penning Catholic greeting cards for a living, and still jealous of her sister, who has a house in the suburbs, two kids, and a husband who loves her. So Angel does the next best thing: She answers a personal ad.Dirk Diederhoff is blond, teaches at Vassar, and is definitely not Italian. Nor is he the thrill-a-minute lover and soul mate Angel prays for.

The award-winning author of Pink Slip gets the rituals and rhythms of domestic life just right in Sometimes I Dream in Italian, a bittersweet comedy about sisters, lovers, and a family that doesn\u2019t quite translate.",
