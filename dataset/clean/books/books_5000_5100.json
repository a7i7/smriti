        "Authors": "By wouk, herman",
        "Description": "Herman Wouk has ranged in his novels from the mighty narrative of The Caine Mutiny and the warm, intimate humor of Marjorie Morningstar to the global panorama of The Winds of War and War and Remembrance. All these powers merge in this major new work of nonfiction, The Will to Live On, an illuminating account of the worldwide revolution that has been sweeping over Jewry, set against a swiftly reviewed background of history, tradition, and sacred literature.Forty years ago, in his modern classic This Is My God, Herman Wouk stated the case for his religious beliefs and conduct. His aim in that work and in The Will to Live On has been to break through the crust of prejudice, to reawaken clearheaded thought about the magnificent Jewish patrimony, and to convey a message of hope for Jewish survival.Although the Torah and the Talmud are timeless, the twentieth century has brought earthquake shocks to the Jews: the apocalyptic experience of the Holocaust, the reborn Jewish state, the precarious American diaspora, and deepening religious schisms. After a lifetime of study, Herman Wouk examines the changes affecting the Jewish world, especially the troubled wonder of Israel, and the remarkable, though dwindling, American Jewry. The book is peppered with wonderful stories of the author's encounters with such luminaries as Ben Gurion, Isidor Rabi, Yitzhak Rabin, Saul Bellow, and Richard Feynan.Learned in general culture, warmly tolerant of other beliefs, this noted author expresses his own other beliefs, this noted author expresses his own faith with a passion that gives the book its fire and does so in the clear, engaging style that--as in all Wouk's fiction--makes the reader want to know what the next page will bring. Herman Wouk writes, in The Will to Live On:\"And so the Melting Pot is beginning to work on Jewry. Its effect was deferred in the passing century by the shock of the Holocaust and the rise of Israel, but today the Holocaust is an academic subject, and Israel is no longer a beleaguered underdog. Amkha in America is not dying, it is slowly melting, and those are very different fates. Dying is a terror, an agony, a strangling finish, to be fought off by sheer instinct, by the will to live on, to the last breath. Melting is a mere diffusion into an ambient welcoming warmth in which one is dissolved and disappears, as a teaspoon of sugar vanishes into hot tea....Yet here in the United States, for all the scary attrition I have pictured, we are still a community of over five million strong. . . . At a far stretch of my hopes, our descendants could one day be a diaspora comparable to Babylonia. At the moment, of course, that is beyond rational expectation. We have to concentrate on lasting at all. . . .\"",

The shock wave that reverberated across the nation that night jolted this city \"too busy to hate,\" a booster's town scrambling to make itself the economic hum of what would become the New South. The explosion also shattered the illusions of a comfortable Reform Jewish congregation, for whom assimilation and acceptance had been proceeding nicely until they found themselves in the crossfire of a renewed battle between white and black.By weaving together the parallel experiences of four different Atlanta communities - the white power structure, the white supremacists, the African Americans, and the Jews - Melissa Fay Greene places at the center of her narrative Jacob Rothschild, the Temple's outspoken rabbi and the lightning rod for the predawn attack. With the visceral power of great writing, The Temple Bombing illuminates as never before the danger facing everyday citizens who try to lead moral lives in an era of defiance. It is a vivid social history, a courtroom drama, and a page-turning mystery rich in character and incident.",

        "Description": "In 1970, Kathy Boudin, revolutionary Weatherman, fled the ruins of a town house on West Eleventh Street in Greenwich Village after a bomb that was being made there exploded, killing three people, and America's sympathy with radicalism fell apart. The Weathermen had started as angry kids who planted stink bombs and emulated the Black Panthers, but the bomb they were building on Eleventh Street was deadly. Kathy, daughter of the celebrated lawyer Leonard Boudin, third generation of the famous Boudin family, emerged naked from the wreckage, was given some clothes by a neighbor, slipped into the night, and went underground for the next eleven years, her name soon appearing on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List.Susan Braudy tells the riveting story of the Boudin family circle through four generations. She writes of Kathy Boudin's childhood, growing up in Manhattan in an ambitious, liberal New York Jewish family, daughter of a revered left-wing labor and civil liberties lawyer and an intellectual poet mother.Braudy writes of Kathy's parents; her father, Leonard, who patterned his life after that of his uncle, the great labor lawyer and leftist legal scholar, Louis B. Boudin (in the 1930s he fought in court for new laws to protect and organize labor unions and was one of the foremost translators and interpreters of Karl Marx). Leonard Boudin fought on behalf of dissenters on the left. He argued the cases of Paul Robeson and the two-time convicted spy Judith Coplon before the Supreme Court, forcing the U.S. government to allow free travel to all citizens and preventing the admission of illegally gathered evidence, rulings that crucially curtailed the power of J. Edgar Hoover.Braudy writes of Boudin's legal work on behalf of such clients as Rockwell Kent and Julian Bond; his defense of Fidel Castro in connection with his seizure of American capital in Cuba; his case on behalf of Dr. Benjamin Spock (arrested for protesting the Vietnam War; Boudin put the war, not Dr. Spock, on trial); and his case on behalf of Daniel Ellsberg, helping him to leak the Pentagon Papers, which set the stage for Nixon's resignation.",

Increasingly, though, a growing number of writers turned their considerable talents to revitalizing the short story form. Enthusiastic readers found short stories to be perfectly suited to our times:  neat little bundles of life-as-it-is-truly-lived to be read in one sitting by the commuter, the traveller, or the busy person in search of intellectual nourishment and pleasure.Our premier issue of the Graywolf Annual salutes this literary renaissance by presenting a dozen stories by such gifted authors as Elizabeth Tallent, Richard Ford, Ellen Gilchrist, Tobias Wolff, and Margaret Atwood.",

It was a special place, where egg creams were stirred just so, where satin jackets were hip, where Manhattan was \"the city\" and just a nickel subway ride away, where you hung out day after day with the boys on the corner - your corner - and played stickball and stoopball through the long summer days, where Coney Island was a magical escape, Nathan's hot dogs gourmet cuisine, and the beloved Dodgers the emblem of a time and place. In these pages, you'll see why \"when you're from Brooklyn, everything else is Tokyo.\"It is also Larry King's own story about growing up and surviving in \"King's Country\" - and about why that name was so ironically and obviously fitting for his own Brooklyn days. In addition, he includes delightful anecdotes by other celebrities - those stars of stage, screen, and public life whom Larry interviews daily - who call New York's most famous borough home, for \"everyone started in Brooklyn\": Woody Allen, Barbra Streisand, Lou Gossett, Jr., Dom DeLuise, Eli Wallach, Isaac Asimov, and Joan Rivers, as well as many more. In fact, one out of every seven Americans can trace his or her roots to Brooklyn.Brooklyn is a metaphor - for all Americans - for the place where we grew up, the place that formed us, the place we may have left behind in order to become who we are today. When You're from Brooklyn, Everything Else Is Tokyo perfectly captures the spirit, the scents, and the sounds of a special time and place and, also, of a special state of mind.",

        "Title": "WAR WITHOUT BLOODSHED: The Art of Politics",
        "Authors": "By Clift, Eleanor and Brazaitis, Tom",
        "Description": "Americans equate Washington with politics. But the underpinnings of government remain intangible - complicated and tangled networks fleetingly exposed during election years. Few understand the intricate relationships that keep the machinery on Capitol Hill constantly churning, constantly changing. Behind each public figure is a deep and far-reaching infrastructure driven by calculated career moves and alliances with carefully chosen and cultivated colleagues. In War Without Bloodshed, journalists Eleanor Clift and Tom Brazaitis uncover the interlocking relationships on Capitol Hill far beyond the job descriptions taught in government and history classes.Each chapter is a slice of the capital's political culture as the authors unveil the tantalizing interplay between Washington posts and personalities. First they note the key positions: the pollster, the lobbyist, the committee chairman, opposition leader, the member of Congress, the chief of staff. They then spotlight exemplary representatives of each job: Stanley Greenberg, the president's pollster, who dreamed of a new Democratic majority, and Frank Luntz, whose polling helped shape the Republican Contract With America; Michael Bromberg, the lobbyist known as Mr. Health Care, who took on Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Paul Equale, the insurance lobbyist, who achieved success at the expense of his youthful idealism; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the philosopher-politician, who bedeviled the White House; Newt Gingrich, who led his party to power for the first time in forty years; Maxine Waters, the congresswoman from South Central Los Angeles, who refused to be marginalized by a white male power structure - Democratic or Republican; and Sheila Burke, the unassuming staffer who agitated the G. O. P.'s right wing by wielding power in the name of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.In War Without Bloodshed, Clift and Brazaitis reveal that every decision is political on Capitol Hill - from the title of a memorandum to the lunch date across the table to one's choice of footwear at a Georgetown dinner party. No career stays within strict partisan lines. The authors offer anecdotes about players from opposite sides who, perceived by the public as enemies, meet secretly - from Stan Greenberg breakfasting with Ronald Reagan's pollster to Newt Gingrich traveling to Texas to consult with Ross Perot. They alternately fraternize, antagonize, and move on. From each character's vantage point, the reader relives the jousting over health-care reform and the turmoil of a tumultuous election, and comes to understand that, in the end, politics is not just about winning and losing. The game is its own reward.",

        "Description": "Over the course of twenty acclaimed novels of suspense, most recently The Murder Book and A Cold Heart, New York Times bestselling author Jonathan Kellerman has pitted psychologist Dr. Alex Delaware against adversaries as disturbed and dangerous as Delaware is clever and compassionate. Now in Kellerman\u2019s gripping new novel, a different hero will hold the reader spellbound: a dedicated young psychologist, unschooled in the ways of violent crime and incalculable evil\u2013until his life is irreversibly touched by both . . . and he is thrust into a chilling hunt for a twenty-first-century Jack the Ripper.When his brief, passionate romance with nurse Jocelyn Banks is cut short by her kidnapping and brutal murder, Dr. Jeremy Carrier is left emotionally devastated, haunted by his lover\u2019s grisly demise and warily eyed by police still seeking a prime suspect in the unsolved slaying. To escape the pain, he buries himself in his work as staff psychologist at City Central Hospital\u2013only to be drawn deeper into a waking nightmare when more women turn up murdered in the same gruesome fashion as Jocelyn Banks . . . and the suspicion surrounding Jeremy intensifies. Now, the only way to prove his innocence and put his torment to rest is to follow the trail of a cunning psychopath.Spurring on Jeremy\u2019s investigation is Dr. Arthur Chess, an enigmatic pathologist who specializes in examining the dead, but harbors a keen fascination with the darker deeds committed by the living. Arthurdraws Jeremy into an unexpected friendship, and into the confidence of a cryptic society devoted to matters unknown and unspoken. When he suddenly slips away, Jeremy is left to contend with an onslaught of anonymous clues\u2013and the growing realization that a harrowing game of cat and mouse has been set in motion.But who besides Jeremy is playing\u2013and who is making the rules? Before the killer strikes again, Jeremy races to connect the disturbing puzzle pieces being fed to him. Yet his search for answers only seems to yield more questions. And deepening the mystery is the undeniable presence of someone watching it all\u2013and guiding Jeremy\u2019s investigation from behind the scenes. As the game intensifies, Jeremy must decide if a secret ally is setting him on the right path . . . or a sadistic enemy is setting him up for a fate far beyond even the most twisted imagination.",

Moore brings his wit and working-class voice to an American public desperate to save what's left of their American dream. His take-no-prisoners attitude is brutally funny, insightful, irrepressible. Whether he's lusting after the First Lady in \"My Forbidden Love for Hillary Clinton\" or sending campaign contributions to Pat Buchanan from the John Wayne Gacey Fan Club, conducting a Rodney King Commemorative Riot or trying to commit Congressman Bob Dornan to a mental hospital, issuing Corporate Crook Trading Cards, or encouraging Congress to take advantage of NAFTA by moving themselves to Tijuana, Michael Moore has the unique gift for making you think and laugh at the same time. He reflects an irreverent intelligence and biting humor so seldom heard in America today. Downsize This! is the perfect antidote to the mind-numbing throb of the election year.",

Through extensive research and interviews with juries, litigants, judges, lawyers, and legal scholars, Nader and Smith counter the corporate-financed propaganda blitz that has painted multibillion-dollar corporations as hapless victims of ordinary Americans bent on suing their way into prosperity. They argue that, in fact, our system has all but abandoned the ideal of providing every American access to justice. Instead, many courts have become the nearly exclusive domain of the country's largest and most powerful corporations - and their lawyers.",

But how many of us have actually sat down and calculated the chances that we could marry a millionaire? Or that the earth could be destroyed by an asteroid?  Now, with Gregory Baer's Life: The Odds, you can find out the answers to these questions and more in a fun, freewheeling, and compulsively readable way. Baer not only gives startling stats but also advice for nudging fate in your favor. Readers will discover the odds of: * Bowling a perfect game  * Catching a ball at a Major League Baseball game * Being canonized as a saint * Picking a winning stock * Surviving a train crash * Getting away with murder (or getting convicted)  * Being well endowed (or poorly endowed) * Reaching the summit of Mount Everest  A great book with a great hook, Life: The Odds is a sure bet to make you laugh-and to make you think.",

        "Description": "Your doctor is the second most important person taking care of your health. You're the first. This book was written so that you can do a better job, without going to medical school. It is designed to help you sort out the vital health information you need--what to consider, what to ignore, what to worry about, what to forget.Deciding how to take care of a pain, an injury, a fever--and whether to call in expert advice--is not always an easy task. Knowing how to prevent disease can be even harder: Will I really live longer and feel better if I cut down on dietary fat, or alcohol, or overwork? The main focus of this book is on prevention: habits you can modify, choices you can make in daily life. Good choices do make a difference. The life expectancy of American adults has been increasing, and it is quite clear that professional medical care is not the only reason people are living longer.But when you do call in the professionals, this book will guide you in asking the right questions about your diagnosis and treatment. When medical decisions must be made, you can be an active partner in making them.The doctors who wrote this book have made some fundamental assumptions about their readers: they are people who want to make their own choices about their health, based on the best possible evidence; they want straightforward information unencumbered with excessive detail; when they talk with their physician, they want to ask intelligent questions and understand the answers; they want to live a long life, but also enjoy it along the way; and they want to see \"the big picture\"--how their personal health is affected by environmental and social forces.",

        "Description": "At 3:58 in the morning of June 5, 2002, Ed and Lois Smart awoke to the sound of their nine-year-old daughter Mary Katherine\u2019s frightened voice. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.  Elizabeth is gone.\u201d  At first they thought she was having a bad dream about her older sister, but Mary Katherine\u2019s seeming bad dream would quickly become their worst nightmare.  Their daughter Elizabeth was gone.They were not sure why the media picked up on Elizabeth\u2019s story, but after their daughter was kidnapped she became the whole world\u2019s daughter.  After nine months of a strange, hard, sometimes rewarding, but mostly painful journey, Elizabeth was miraculously returned to them.  Just as millions throughout the world had grieved for her loss, now they celebrated her safe return.  In Bringing Elizabeth Home, Ed and Lois share the pain of every parent\u2019s worst fear: \u201cWhat would I do if my child was taken from me?\u201d  They also share a story of great hope, strong faith, and trust in God.  The Smart family had always been devoted to their Mormon faith, but through their terribly painful experience they gained a tremendous inner strength, which became the key to their survival.  They write, \u201cHaving our daughter back home, in our arms, is nothing short of a miracle.  It is the ultimate proof that God answers prayers.  Granted, sometimes the answer is not the one we pray for, but still it remains an answer.   We feel truly blessed that He answered our prayers the way we had hoped for, although we realize, regretfully, that this is not always the outcome in kidnapping cases.  We have met so many families with missing children and we\u2019ve seen how deep their pain goes . . . But what we hope to convey through our journey of faith and hope is that with a strong belief in God, all things are possible.  Miracles do happen.\u201dIn the end, the Smarts\u2019 story brings one point poignantly home--nothing is more important in this world than family. Not money.  Not work. Not a fancy new car or an expensive, big house.  Family, the prayers of so many friends and strangers, and trust in God are what got them through this experience--and having survived, they have no doubt that they can persevere in any situation as long as those three things are in their lives.  Though their story is filled with many incredible twists and turns, they never lost focus on what was important: bringing Elizabeth home.",

While your chronological age is fixed, your biological age may be years older--or younger--depending on a combination of factors. RealAge offers a revolutionary, systematic program that calculates the aging effect of more than 100 different health behaviors--ranging from diet and medication to stress control and chronic smoking--and enables you to assess your own biological age. Most important, it shows you how to design a specific path to improving or reversing your own aging trajectory.  Developed by Dr. Michael F. Roizen, chair of anesthesia and critical care at the University of Chicago and preventive gerontologist, along with four other scientists, the RealAge program is based on cutting-edge scientific research. Dr. Roizen and his team have pored over 25,000 medical studies, evaluating what they tell us about aging and what they tell us about the prevention of aging.  In RealAge, they present the complete results of their analysis for the first time.  Each chapter covers a broad health topic--for example, how the right vitamins and supplements, exercise, or diet can be used to control how your genes affect you--and calculates the RealAge advantage you will gain by adopting a specific behavior. Charts, fact sheets, and tests give you specific choices to make and describe benefits to be gained so you can measure your success.    Suggested behavior changes are rated in order of difficulty so you can decide whether the result is worth the effort.  Ultimately, this program is about maintaining your health. The better condition you are in, the better prepared you will be to fight the factors that age you. RealAge demonstrates that you can have more control over the aging process. It makes science simple and its promise is irresistible: You may live as young at seventy as you did at forty-four. Remeber your high school reunion?  Even though everyone was the same chronological age, people no longer looked the same. Some wore the years well, staying young and exuberant despite the passage of time, whereas others looked as if they had aged ten years more than everyone else--and probably had.  Did you know that:  Financial stress can make your RealAge two to thirty-two years older?  The difference between having the ideal blood pressure 115/76--and high blood pressure--higher than 140/90--can make a RealAge difference of more than twenty years?  A tablet of aspirin a day can make your RealAge 1.9 years younger?  Flossing daily and seeing a dentist and dental hygienist every six months can make your RealAge 6.4 years younger? In  RealAge you will discover many other easy-to-institute Age Reduction Strategies that will enable you to live longer and younger.",

        "Title": "Eat, Drink, & Be Merry: America's Doctor Tells You Why the Health Experts are Wrong",
        "Authors": "By Edell, Dean and Schrieberg, David",
        "Description": "\"Help me, Dr. Dean! I want to be healthy, but I just don't know where to turn for advice.\"No wonder. How often have you felt whipsawed by the experts, confused by conflicting advice, or torn with guilt over what you eat, drink, think? Prepare yourself for a shock: You can relax, enjoy life, and still be healthy. This is a different kind of health book by a different kind of doctor. Dr. Dean Edell, a former surgeon whose radio call-in show is heard by millions of listeners every day, sifts through the outrageous health claims flooding the media. He takes on the health gurus who urge you to abandon much of what you enjoy in life and make you worry needlessly. He frankly discusses sex and drugs, evaluates alternative medical practices, and pleads with our germ-phobic society to just calm down. He also gives you the scoop on what really goes on inside hospitals and inside the minds of doctors. Chill out. Dr. Dean is going to change the way you think. You can eat certain fat-laden foods and be healthy. You can exercise far less than you thought and in ways you never imagined. You can enjoy sex and even some mood-altering substances in moderation, and do a world of good for your body and mind. Dr. Dean's radio audience has heard him condemn the very media that keep him in business. In the book and on the air, Edell exposes the sloppy, irresponsible, and dangerous health reporting that is the daily fodder of newspapers, talk shows, and TV news segments. Scare stories and miracle cures make news, responsible follow-ups do not. From the headlines, you'd think that rare diseases like mad cow and ebola are lurking in every hamburger or on every toilet seat. Read the chapter on germs to learn why our abuse of antibiotics poses a far greater threat to our health. In other chapters you'll discover the link between chronic fatigue syndrome and environmental illness, and find out why you should relax and enjoy that glass of wine with dinner. Dr. Dean's experience within the medical establishment, in the alternative medicine community, and in the media give him a unique vantage point from which to evaluate breaking medical news. He offers a critical perspective that cannot be matched by anyone else today, either in the media or in medicine. Dr. Dean tells you what has been scientifically proved and what has not. Most important, he gives you the tools you need to make good personal health decisions about the next crop of health gurus and the next medical \"breakthroughs.\" He teaches you to rely on common sense and a critical eye, and to trust yourself and your judgment, based always on what is scientifically sound. Seasoned, frank, funny, and compassionate, Dr. Dean is an iconoclast who takes on the medical establishment, the health-and-fitness industry, and the media with equal gusto. In Eat, Drink, and Be Merry he offers you the truth about healthy living. Be forewarned: Some of your most cherished beliefs about health may fall by the wayside. Did You Know That . . . People who crave ice chips may have a nutritional deficiency? An octogenarian in China disclosed his secret of longevity: a diet that includes rats? Saturated fat may reduce the risk of stroke? Some canned and frozen foods can be more nutritious than fresh? Dementia appears to be less common among those who eat more fish? You can lose weight by fidgeting, chewing on a pencil, or drinking coffee? Exercising in polluted air is worse for your lungs than not exercising at all? Playing an instrument is not only good for your mental health, it burns 160 calories an hour? Certain snake oils may have actual therapeutic potential? Research shows that aloe vera slows healing of wounds? Sex can cure headaches? The aromas of pumpkin pie and lavender can be erotic stimulants? It can make a difference what gender your doctor is? Studies show that people often postpone dying until after holidays?",

But something goes horribly, tragically wrong during what should have been a simple transfer of goods. The sapphires vanish without a trace.

But something is troubling about this assignment, because someone else is chasing Kate Chandler as well.Only Kate suspects the awful truth: She's unwittingly stumbled into a conspiracy of deceit, betrayal, and cold-blooded murder that goes far beyond a simple jewel heist. And a chilling, threatening voice on the telephone only confirms her worst suspicions.

        "Description": "An evenhanded look at how democracies can fight terrorism while maintaining a healthy society.The bombings of the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma City federal building have shown that terrorist attacks can happen anywhere in the United States. Around the globe, massacres, hijackings, and bombings of airliners are frequent reminders of the threat of terrorism. The use of poison gas in the Tokyo subway has raised the specter of even more horrible forms of terror -- including the use of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. In this book, Philip Heymann argues that the United States and other democracies can fight terrorism while preserving liberty and maintaining a healthy, unified society. Drawing on his experience in the US Departments of State and Justice, he shows how domestic and foreign intelligence-gathering can thwart terrorism, how the United States must cooperate and share information with its allies, and how terrorism can be prevented in many cases. Terrorism will never disappear completely, but the policies Heymann offers can limit the harm to Americans and protect the integrity of US governmental processes.",

No one ever gets murdered in Kickapoo Falls, and it is up to Deputy Pennington, the trusted number-two man in the Sheriff's Department, to find the killer.
