        "Description": "\"Whatever\" is now the password into civilized youth culture. Alarming numbers of Christians eighteen to twenty-five years old believe that there is no such thing as absolute truth. Yet, Ryan Dobson proclaims, we can't even function if we believe that everything is relative. In his first book, the impassioned youth speaker explains God's establishment of absolutes, using relevant examples to awaken Christians to the world's desperate hunger for absolute truth -- and the church's duty to proclaim it.OUR GENERATION IS BEING DESTROYED BY RAMPANT TOLERANCE.  Somebody\u2019s cheating at school?  \u201cWell, that\u2019s his business.\u201d  Your roommate wants an abortion?  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it, but hey, it\u2019s her life.\u201d  Accepting everything means you believe in nothing. When it comes to right and wrong, sitting on the fence won\u2019t get you\u2014or the people you love\u2014anywhere. Passiveness is not love. Love is getting in people\u2019s face and telling them the truth.  Finally, someone has the courage to point out that some ideas are simply stupid. Honest and unflinching, Ryan Dobson will show you how to back up your beliefs and be intolerant\u2014in love.",

        "Description": "The famously false memoirs of James Frey may be yesterday\u2019s news, but as this funny riff reminds us, literary fakes are as old as literature itself. Ian Minot is an aspiring writer who labors over short stories that seem destined to remain unread. His beautiful Romanian girlfriend, Anya Petrescu, finds success more easily\u2014and leaves Ian for Blade Markham, a bloviating ex-gangbanger whose \u201cso-called memoir\u201d is a best-seller. When Ian is approached by ex-editor Jed Roth, who wants Ian to publish Jed\u2019s pulpy tale of book theft and murder as a memoir, then renounce it, it\u2019s a chance for both of them to get revenge: Jed on his former employer, and Ian on the world. Although Langer may be too cute for some (he employs made-up slang in which a penis is a portnoy), he does an engaging job with the hall-of-mirrors plot. And if readers can predict that the book they\u2019re reading is the one that Ian ends up writing, they\u2019ll never guess the ending. Just when you want a surprising twist, Langer delivers several.",

With Savannah Seasons Chef Terry, working with her daughter Alexis, brings all the warmth of the South, and the secrets of her culinary wizardry, into the kitchens of home cooks everywhere.She began cooking simply for her family--husband Michael, and daughters Alexis and Celeste--but for the past fifteen years Elizabeth Terry, winner of the l995 James Beard Award as Best Chef in the Southeast, and her eponymous restaurant in Savannah, have been known for serving simply prepared, perfectly fresh, innovative dishes in the Southern tradition. Unlike most great restaurants, Elizabeth on 37th is a family enterprise--as is Savannah Seasons. All of the two hundred recipes collected here have been tested by co-author Alexis in the Terry home kitchen (located \"above the store\") to ensure that they are well within the range of any amateur cook. From Hearty Okra Gumbo with Chicken and Shrimp to Savannah Red Rice, from Soft Shell Crabs to Ragout of Venison, you will find interpreted within these pages all the native bounty of a rich regional cuisine--shellfish, sweet Vidalia onions, and black-eyed peas; recipes for relishes and marinades; crisp, fresh salads; delicious baked goods, and much more. And throughout there are chef's tips and stories, in the voices of Elizabeth, Alexis, Michael, and Celeste, about the food, about life in Savannah, and about their experiences at \"the family restaurant.\" Savannah Seasons is not only a book of outstanding recipes but a book full of warmth, joy, and hospitality.",

        "Title": "Saint Saul: A Skeleton Key to the Historical Jesus",
        "Authors": "By Akenson, Donald Harman",
        "Description": "The gospels, scholars agree, were written after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. This catastrophic event, argues Donald Akenson, forever altered the outlook--and the agenda--of the Christian and Jewish faiths. Of all the New Testament writings, only Paul's letters were composed before 70 CE. Thus, Akenson says, they are the only direct evidence we have that is untainted by this profound and lasting shift in perspective. And yet this most important source on the life of Jesus is also the most neglected.       In Saint Saul, Akenson offers a lively and provocative account of what we can learn about Jesus by reading the letters of Paul, providing fresh new insights into both Jesus and Paul. Akenson painstakingly recreates the world of Christ, a time rich with ideas, prophets, factions, priests, savants, and god-drunk fanatics. He insistently stresses throughout the Jewishness of Jesus (for example, referring to Jesus and Paul as Yeshua and Saul, as they were then known). Equally important, he dismisses the traditional method of searching for facts about Jesus by looking for parallels among the four gospels; they were handed down to us as a unit by a later generation, he argues. Saul, although he did not know Yeshua personally, knew his most important followers, and wrote immediately after Yeshua's death. Saul's teachings were approved (though sometimes reluctantly) by Yeshua's brothers and other early leaders.      As an eminent historian, Akenson approaches his subject with a fresh eye and a scholarly rigor that is all too rare in this hotly disputed field. The result is a vibrantly written and provocative book that will captivate anyone seeking to know more about the historical Jesus and the earliest Christians.",

        "Authors": "By Feinstein, John and Mediate, Rocco",
        "Description": "The U.S. Open in June 2008 produced one of the most unexpected, dramatic, and memorable showdowns in golf history. Day after day, Rocco Mediate, a respected journeyman whose career had been dogged by injuries, pushed the seemingly invincible Tiger Woods to his physical and mental limits. Not even Mediate would ever have predicted that for five days, he would match the unbeaten world number one player, explosive shot for explosive shot.The first 72 holes ended with Mediate and Woods locked in a dead heat, and an 18-hole Monday playoff was required to decide a winner. When this was still not enough to break the tie, the two men went into a sudden-death round before a champion was finally crowned. Through each stage, the irrepressible Rocco rose to the ever-escalating pressure with clutch shots, grace, and humor, emerging as one of the most likable and intriguing golfers of our time.Now, at last, Rocco Mediate tells his own story: his life in golf, the battles to stay healthy enough to play, the everyday struggles of a tour player. It all leads up to his story of the Open, and the joy he felt as he seized the challenge he'd dreamed of and trained for his entire life. In this intimate collaboration with bestselling author John Feinstein, Rocco Mediate looks back at his life through the prism of the 2008 season and the life-changing tournament. And through interviews with Rocco's family, friends, and other top golfers, Feinstein vividly brings to life one of the most heroic golfing battles of all time.",

        "Authors": "By Ferguson, Niall",
        "Description": "Is America an empire? Certainly not, according to our government.\u00a0Despite the conquest of two sovereign states in as many years, despite the presence of more than 750 military installations in two thirds of the world\u2019s countries and despite his stated intention \"to extend the benefits of freedom...to every corner of the world,\" George W. Bush maintains that \"America has never been an empire.\" \"We don\u2019t seek empires,\" insists Defense Secretary Rumsfeld. \"We\u2019re not imperialistic.\"Nonsense, says Niall Ferguson. In Colossus he argues that in both military and economic terms America is nothing less than the most powerful empire the world has ever seen. Just like the British Empire a century ago, the United States aspires to globalize free markets, the rule of law, and representative government. In theory it\u2019s a good project, says Ferguson. Yet Americans shy away from the long-term commitments of manpower and money that are indispensable if rogue regimes and failed states really are to be changed for the better. Ours, he argues, is an empire with an attention deficit disorder, imposing ever more unrealistic timescales on its overseas interventions. Worse, it\u2019s an empire in denial\u2014a hyperpower that simply refuses to admit the scale of its global responsibilities. And the negative consequences will be felt at home as well as abroad. In an alarmingly persuasive final chapter Ferguson warns that this chronic myopia also applies to our domestic responsibilities. When overstretch comes, he warns, it will come from within\u2014and it will reveal that more than just the feet of the American colossus is made of clay.",

        "Description": "This is an accessible book that delineates how progressives and the progressive movement have created the American idea and ideals and forged the kind of country in which we want to live. It creates a platform from which to argue how progressives today are fighting to improve America, in contrast to how conservatives have always worked to defend the interests of elites.Each chapter will tell the reader a story focusing on different subjects, such as efforts to enact civil rights laws, social security, the middle class, how the idea of America changed the world, and why most of us can vote.Lux points out what he feels the Democrats have done wrong during the last decades and how the lessons of history can point to making positives changes. Lux shows how the progressives have been instrumental in creating big positive change moments, and argues that as a new administration takes office in 2009 the time will be ripe for a new big change moment,. He outlines how he believes progressive policies can be channeled to solves the big problems facing us today.",
