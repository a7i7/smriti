Because when Peter Tummelier, his buddy from childhood, suddenly appears, bodies start showing up, too.

Only by destroying his closest friend can Roscoe save his own family, clear his name, and avoid a hideous death himself.Sophisticated, suspenseful, and replete with page-turning drive that marks the finest thrillers, Tap, Tap is a riveting examination of the ties that bind - and the ties that strangle, too.",

        "Title": "Mandate of Heaven: A New Generation of Entrepreneurs, Dissidents, Bohemians, and Technocrats Lays Claim to China's Future",
        "Authors": "By Schell, Orville",
        "Description": "This astonishing new book by Orville Schell, for thirty years America's foremost chronicler of contemporary China, offers a unique look at the China of the mid-'90s and the generation that stands poised to inherit the \"mandate of heaven,\" the right to govern the world's largest nation.China's current leaders - already in their eighties and nineties - will soon be leaving the country's political scene. Their departure raises the ultimate question: Who will assume power? The generation that was the natural heir was decimated in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s and '70s. Thus, with the end of the Deng era, it is left to a new generation, with a drastically different set of experiences and priorities, to take over.The crackdown that followed the democracy protest in Tiananmen Square in 1989 seemed to foretell doom to international investment and any possibility of political freedom, but Deng Xiaoping, who had already begun instituting bold capitalist-style economic reforms in the 1980s, maneuvered China back onto the path of reform, and by 1992 China had become the fastest growing economy in the world. Yet China remains a place where even peaceful expression of political views is punishable by imprisonment.Traveling back to China many times since 1989, Schell takes readers on a series of trips inside the latter-day People's Republic to meet the people who acted out the drama of the Square and who are now playing the leading roles in China's high-speed rush into the future. With the intimacy of an old friend, Schell introduces us to these ordinary and extraordinary characters, not necessarily the children of the elite, as some might expect, but students, workers, peasants, entrepreneurs, teachers, soldiers, intellectuals, labor leaders, and pop stars.As China's importance on the world stage grows, it becomes increasingly necessary that the West acquaint itself with the \"new China\" and get to know these young people who must now negotiate a way out of their country's myriad contradictions. With his knowledge of Chinese history and his unparalleled understanding of the Chinese people, Schell is the perfect writer to interpret the changes that will determine the future of this important but uncertain land.",

        "Description": "Cousins Dahlia and Sunny Gordon were best friends growing up, bound by a shared love for making music that was as pure, powerful, and radiant as the California sunshine. When Dahlia's soulful lyrics combined with Sunny's soaring melodies, magic happened, and they promised they would stick together all the way to the top. But a darkness was already descending on Sunny, one that would ultimately plunge her into a nightmare of solitude and schizophrenia. And after their lives were torn apart, a quarter of a century would pass before the cousins would meet again.After long years of fruitless struggle, Dahlia still dreams of making it in the L.A. music business, a dream that comes to rest on one song. A lucky break has brought a composition she and Sunny wrote long ago to the attention of a powerful Hollywood producer. Desperate for success, Dahlia must find her cousin in order to secure the rights to the song that will win her fame and great fortune.But the world Sunny Gordon now inhabits is a place of madness and despair, and her obstinate refusal to sign a contract only infuriates Dahlia and strengthens her resolve. There are no depths Dahlia will not sink to in order to get what she wants -- even if it means moving her tragically damaged cousin, demons and all, into her own home.Yet selfish motives and greed are, remarkably, leading Dahlia somewhere she never imagined she'd go. For the first time since she was a girl -- and perhaps the first time ever -- she will have to put someone else's needs before her own, and her life will be unexpectedly transformed in the process.And sometimes, even when real life reaches its cruelest and lowest ebb, miracles do happen ...",

        "Authors": "By Hotchner, A. E. and Newman, Paul",
        "Description": "\u201cThere are three rules for running a business; fortunately, we don\u2019t know any of them.\u201dIn 1978, Paul Newman and A. E. Hotchner decided that rather than just distribute Paul\u2019s own salad dressing at Christmas to neighbors, they would offer it to a few local stores. Freewheeling, irreverent entrepreneurs, they conceived of their venture as a great way to poke fun at the mundane method of traditional marketing. Much to their surprise, the dressing was enthusiastically received. What had started as a lark quickly escalated into a full-fledged business, the first company to place all-natural foods in supermarkets. From salad dressing to spaghetti sauce, to popcorn and lemonade, Newman\u2019s Own became a major player in the food business. The company\u2019s profits were originally donated to medical research, education, and the environment, and eventually went to the creation of the eight Hole in the Wall Gang camps for children with serious illnesses. In these pages Newman and Hotchner recount the picaresque saga of their own nonmanagement adventure. In alternating voices, playing off one another in classic \u201cOdd Couple\u201d style, they describe how they systematically disregarded the advice of experts and relied instead on instinct, imagination, and mostly luck. They write about how they hurdled obstacle after obstacle, share their hilarious misadventures, and reveal their offbeat solutions to conventional problems. Even their approach to charity is decidedly different: every year they give away all the company\u2019s profits, empty the coffers, and start over again. The results of this amazing generosity are brought to life in heartwarming stories about the children at their camps.With rare glimpses into their zany style and their compassion for those less fortunate, Newman and Hotchner have written the perfect nonmanagement book, at once playful, informative, and inspirational.",

Everyone knows that feisty, sensual Gerry Fitzgerald wasn't always so outspoken. As a young, impressionable novitiate, Gerry became pregnant. She fled the altar just as she was about to take her vows to become a nun and never breathed a word about why. Twenty-eight years later the child she gave up for adoption has come back into her life, a grown woman looking for answers. For Gerry, the question is how to defuse the years of guilt, shame, and bitterness that divide her from her daughter, how to create and nurture a bond as fragile as a cobweb. As Gerry opens the emotional floodgates she also unexpectedly finds that her feelings for her lover, symphony conductor Aubrey Roellinger, grow more complex and consuming. No longer only a series of satisfying trysts with manageable emotional boundaries, their relationship has begun to crack open both their cautious hearts.  Compulsively readable, Taste of Honey brings fans back to the idyllic California valley with characters who take on new dimensions as their secrets emerge and their lives and loves progress.

So when dirty cops made him head for cover with Frank, his pious Jesuit brother in Mexico, he did it in his own unique style - disguised as a priest. But Frank never mentioned that Mexico was locked in its own bloody struggle, with government troops ruthlessly attacking the clergy and their faithful. Soon, the black robes that got Tommy across the border have him hanging from a noose in the dusty village square of Santa Maria.But then provinces or plain Irish luck collapses the scaffold, Tommy blasts his way free, and a whisper ripples through the crowd: Un milagro - a miracle! In the eyes of the peasants, he is now the padre with God on his side, a new leader who will deliver them from their misery. Frank sees Padre Tommy from a more mercenary angle - he knows his brother has all the skills to lead a fierce crusade in the name of the church. And heaven-sent Lourdes, the tragically beautiful nun who tends Tommy's wounds, knows only that her attraction to this priest is as powerful as it is forbidden.While Tommy ponders his divine change of fortune, Frank prepares a scheme more suitable for wise guys than men of the cloth.

His newest novel, Vitals, begins with a harrowing descent to a netherworld at the very bottom of the sea\u2013and then explodes to the surface in sheer terror.Hal Cousins is one of a handful of scientists nearing the most sought after discovery in human history: the key to short-circuiting the aging process. Fueled by a wealth of research, an overdose of self-confidence, and the money of influential patrons to whom he makes outrageous promises, Hal experiments with organisms living in the hot thermal plumes in the ocean depths. But as he journeys beneath the sea, his other world is falling apart.Across the country, scientists are being inexplicably murdered\u2013including Hal\u2019s identical twin brother, who is also working to unlock the key to immortality.

For he is not the first person to come close to ending aging forever\u2013and those who came before him will stop at nothing to keep the secret to themselves.

When the governor of the Bank of England invites her to his office, she's intrigued. When he explains that he suspects someone at the notoriously cutthroat Inter-Continental Bank of corrupt trading practices, she's not entirely surprised. But when he asks her to go undercover for him working at the bank, to discover and document the corruption, she's initially shocked. Why her? First, he says, because she knows the ins and outs of trading better than anyone else. And second, because due to her reputation as a bit of a wild card no one will imagine she could be working for the government. The glamour of all the secrecy, and the challenge of working for the government, prove too hard to resist, so Sarah agrees to go along. It all seems, at the beginning, on the up-and-up.James Bartrop, the director of Counter-Narcotics Crime at M16, has spent years tracking Anthony Fieri, a powerful Mafia financier whose long and illustrious career has included everything from drug and arms smuggling to political fixing and simple assassination. Bartrop now believes that Fieri has entered new territory, and is the invisible hand behind an elaborate scheme to take tens of millions of \"legitimate\" dollars out of the international currency markets. Bartrop will stop at nothing to find a clear, provable path through the complex web of financial fraud back to Fieri.Sarah soon uncovers clues to an illegal scheme reaping multimillion-dollar profits for a small group of corrupt traders, and she begins secretly gathering evidence to expose it. But when a friend and a colleague at the bank are murdered, she realizes there is much more going on than anyone is telling her, and that the fraud extends way beyond the world of merchant banking...",

        "Description": "John J. Sweeney and the new leadership of the AFL-CIO are committing millions of dollars and thousands of organizers to the mobilization of working people all over the country. America Needs a Raise is Sweeney's manifesto. It is a blunt yet compassionate account of the dilemmas facing American workers of all kinds: high tech and low, immigrant and native born, blue collar and white. Sweeney targets the growing disparity between rich and poor, the decline in the standard of living of middle- and working-class Americans, the overwork and unemployment, the racial polarization and ethnic animosity, and the gnawing sense of powerlessness and uncertainty that afflicts us all. He indicts corporate America too for its \" lean and mean \" abdication of social responsibility. He offers a way of dealing with the realities of the global economy that is more effective and humane than the downsizing of America and the sacrifice of working people on the altar of international competitiveness.

In the years following the Civil War, first-generation Irish-American Zachary O'Hara, son of a legendary Marine and a force of a man in his own right, finds himself playing a critical role in the very future of the Marines. If he can persuade the Secretary of the Navy that the Marines are more crucial than ever to America's safety and security -- all the while hefting a heavier secret weight in his heart -- he'll save the corps and make his career.But there's an obstacle in his path that this warrior had not planned on. Amanda Blanton Kerr, the daughter of a ruthless industrialist, is a woman on a mission of her own; passionate, obstinate, and whip-smart, she's an heiress poised to blaze a trail for her sex.O'Hara's Choice is the story of the inevitable collision of these two handsome, fighting spirits. Getting their souls' desire could jeopardize everything they -- and their parents before them -- scraped and struggled to achieve.Duty to country, love of family, and a tormented passion intertwine in this latest epic by Leon Uris, international bestselling author of such classics as Exodus, Trinity, and Battle Cry. A riveting, sweeping tale in inimitable Uris style, O'Hara's Choice is this master of the historical novel at his most brilliant.",

By describing the basic principles behind sociology, Charon encourages readers to think critically about their assumptions concerning their lives and society.

        "Description": "For fourteen years, critic Joe Queenan walked past the Winter Garden Theater in New York City without once even dreaming of venturing inside to see Cats. One fateful afternoon in March 1996, however, having grown weary of his hopelessly elitist lifestyle, he decided to buy a half-price ticket and check out Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking juggernaut. No, he did not expect the musical to be any good, but surely there were limits to how bad it could be. Here, Queenan was tragically mistaken. Cats, what Grease would look like if all the cast members were dressed up like KISS, was infinitely more idiotic than he had ever imagined. Yet now the Rubicon had been crossed. Queenan had involuntarily launched himself on a harrowing personal oddyssey: an 18-month descent into the abyss of American popular culture. At first, Queenan found things to be every bit as atrocious as he expected. John Tesh defiling the temple of Carnegie Hall reminded him of Adolf Hitler goose-stepping in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. The Celestine Prophecy and The Horse Whisperer proved to be prodigiously cretinous. And the sight of senior citizens forking over their hard-earned nickels and dimes to watch Joe Pesci in Gone Fishin' so moved Queenan that he began standing outside the theater issuing refunds to exiting patrons. But then something strange happened. Queenan started enjoying Barry Manilow concerts. He went to see Julie Andrews and Liza Minnelli and Raquel Welch in Victor/Victoria. He said nice things about Larry King and Charles Grodin in his weekly TV Guide column. He spent hours planted in front of the television, transfixed by special, two-hour episodes of Walker: Texas Ranger. He actually ordered the dreaded zuppa toscana at the Olive Garden. Most frightening of all, he shook hands with Geraldo Rivera. How Queenan finally escaped from the cultural Hot Zone and returned to civilization is an epic tale as heart-warming, awe-inspiring, and life-affirming as Robinson Crusoe, The Adventures of Marco Polo, Gulliver's Travels, and Swiss Family Robinson.

Stalking Horse is an odds-on favorite to win Shoemaker a huge and devoted readership.Colley Killebrew, the hero of Stalking Horse, was a jockey himself, one of the best in the business, until a race-fixing scandal got him barred from the track seven years before. But Colley blew more than his racing career - he also lost Francie Dorn, the irresistible redhead he loved. Colley wants Francie back and badly. So badly he'll even cut a deal with Raymond Starbuck the former track steward who destroyed his reputation.The deal works like this: Colley goes down to New Orleans to foul up a racetrack scam that a rich, sleek aristocrat named Remy Courville is running. If Colley can keep Remy and his unsavory cronies from muscling in on the old Magnolia Park track, Starbuck will give him ten thousand dollars and Francie Dorn's address. But Colley doesn't expect to run into Lea, Starbuck's leggy, blond daughter, who is as adept at seducing men as she is at blowing them away....From the racetrack barns to the mansions of Los Angeles and the steamy plantations of New Orleans, Shoemaker guides us through an intricate tale that could only play out at the races. With Stalking Horse, the fabled jockey who triumphed in four Kentucky Derbies takes yet another winner across the finish line.",

        "Description": "Net Worth explains how businesses can benefit by forming new partnerships with customers in matters of information capture and privacy. Consumers are losing patience with companies that use personal data about buying habits, income levels, and credit card usage for corporate gain. What consumers need is a new kind of business&#151;an information intermediary or infomediary&#151;to protect customers' privacy while maximizing their information assets. Companies playing the infomediary role will become agents of customer information, marketing such data to businesses on consumers' behalf and protecting consumer privacy. John Hagel, co-author of the bestselling Net Gain, teams with Marc Singer to lay out the underlying economic and competitive dynamics that will foster the emerging business of the infomediary. Net Worth identifies the convergence of commerce, technology, and consumer frustration as the incubator for the infomediary business, as consumers seek to release their personal information only when they can receive value in exchange for their data.",

        "Description": "He\u2019s a spit-and-polish Marine, a competitive boxer, a classics scholar, and an assistant DA in Manhattan. New York tabloids call him \u201cpit bull\u201d for his relentless prosecution of high-profile defendants like Sean \u201cPuff Daddy\u201d Combs and the \u201cbaby-faced butchers\u201d of Central Park. When Baghdad fell, Colonel Matthew Bogdanos was in Southern Iraq, tracking down terrorist networks through their financing and weapons smuggling\u2014until her heard about the looting of the museum. Immediately setting out across the desert with an elite group chosen from his multiagency task force, he risked his career and his life in pursuit of Iraq\u2019s most priceless treasures.Thieves of Baghdad takes you from his family\u2019s flight to safety at Ground Zero on 9/11, to his mission to hunt down al-Qaeda terrorists in Afghanistan, and into the war-torn streets of Baghdad on the trail of antiquities. Colorful characters and double-dealing are the norm as Bogdanos tries to sort out what really happened during the chaos of war. We see his team going on raids and negotiating recoveries, blowing open safes and mingling in the marketplaces, and tracking down leads from Zurich and Amman to Lyons, London, and New York. In an investigation that led to the recovery of more than 5,000 priceless objects, complex threads intertwine, and the suspense mounts as the team works to locate the most sensational treasure of all, the treasure of Nimrud, a collection of gold jewelry and precious stones often called \u201cIraq\u2019s Crown Jewels.\u201dA mixture of police procedural, treasure hunt, wartime thriller, and cold-eyed assessment of the connection between the antiquities trade and weapons smuggling, Thieves of Baghdad exposes sordid truths about the international art and antiquities market. It also explores the soul of a man who is equal parts hardened Marine, dedicated father, and passionate scholar. Most of all it demonstrates that, in a culture as old as that of the Middle East, nothing is ever quite what it seems.",

        "Description": "\"My heart stopped peacefully, its beating grew slow and weak, and then just -- stopped. I died young. There is, really, only a little to tell.\"And so ended, in 1900, the short but remarkable life of explorer and writer Mary Henrietta Kingsley, most of which was spent caring for her ailing mother, and attending to the business of her world-wandering father. But the moment she was unencumbered, she set out on her own journey of discovery. Blithely ignoring the narrowly circumscribed roles and rules for a young woman of her day, she traveled alone to West Africa, and went to places no European had ever been.\"Oh, silent friend, if you ever come to read this ... I am in Africa. Soon I will be walking inland, heading to places unknown.\"It is almost a hundred years later, on her fourteenth birthday, that Lily Austin first hears the name of Mary Kingsley, the only female face in a book full of male adventurers. That night, as an ice storm rages outside, something awful and unexpected befalls Lily; and this is why, as she matures into a young woman, it is to the writings of Kingsley that she returns again and again for solace and comfort -- which she finds, especially, in a secret cache of intimate letters Kingsley wrote to an unnamed woman in the distant future. Lily, the child of professional actors, begins to write a play about Kingsley.\"When they buried me at sea, off the coast of South Africa, the strangest thing happened. My coffin wouldn't sink. It floated away from the ship ... Imagine that. I was still sailing the seas, even in death. I was wandering away.\"On the surface, Lily Austin's life could not be more different from Mary Kingsley's. And yet, working on the play, she finds in her subject's wit and resourcefulness the inspiration -- the bravery -- she needs to navigate the complicated waters of intimacy and betrayal, kindness and love.A triumph of the imagination, Hello to the Cannibals is Richard Bausch's most dazzling and beautifully crafted novel to date.",

But a quieter event also takes place that day.  A woman arrives on the O\u2019Rourke doorstep to find a household on the brink of chaos but brimming with love--and, she hopes, answers. Kate Harris is searching for the key to her own mystery. Six months ago her younger sister fled far from their beloved home following a devastating confrontation.
