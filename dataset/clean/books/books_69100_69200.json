        "Description": "Burning vengeance...  Ethan MacCarrick was a heartbreakingly handsome rake until a powerful nobleman ordered him brutally beaten and his face scarred for a crime he didn't commit. Ethan's reprisal -- bankrupting the nobleman and forcing his exile -- does little to appease his wrath. Ten years later, a haughty, mysterious beauty enchants Ethan -- the daughter of his enemy. At last, Ethan will have the revenge he's craved; he'll promise her marriage, seduce her, then cast her aside.  Bitter hardships...  When Madeleine van Rowen's family was suddenly plunged into destitution and dishonor, she steeled herself against further heartache. She never weakened, never trusted, until a towering, scarred Highlander relentlessly pursues her, breaking down her defenses.  At what price forgiveness?   The passion between them burns hotter than Ethan's fury, and soon he finds he can't let her go. But when Madeleine uncovers the truth about him, can Ethan convince her to accept all he now offers -- when he once destroyed everything she had?",

        "Authors": "By Henle, Richard A., Kuvshinoff, Boris W., and Kuvshinoff, C. M.",
        "Description": "The advent of desktop computing has revolutionized the way work is organized and performed in today's office environments.  Yet the proliferation of competing software and hardware--with a mind-boggling array of applications --has also yielded widespread confusion. Too often the marvelous potential of desktop computing is victimized by poor planning and limited insight.  And new users are often ill equipped to see how their activity fits into \"the big picture.\" Now there is a remarkable new book that provides the global overview needed to truly understand and benefit from the huge capabilities offered by today's technology. \"Desktop Computers\" covers everything: the facts about available hardware and software options, what operating systems are and how they work, why networking may increase productivity, and how peripherals can enhance performance.  Unlike the swarm of books on specialized topics or name-brand software, this volume provides an overall perspective that makes it easier to grasp the function and best application of the entire many-faceted desktop system.  It is written by two experts with years of experience in computer design, user documentation, and teaching.  The text is carefully organized in an easy-to-read format, with many illustrations and practical examples.  It is the perfect guide for users and students seeking a clear understanding of desktop computing. It is also  an indispensable resource for all those interested in getting the most out  of computer resources: office managers, networking supervisors, database administrators, and technical support directors. Version 2: This book is required reading for novice and experienced desktop computer users. Both casual users and those who face the problem of setting up complex networks in office and engineering environments will benefit from this convenient guide to understanding desktop computer technology. In this book, authors Henle and Kuvshinoff bring not only their own experience in practical applications, but also 12 years of student projects and theoretical research to bear on this pervasive technology.  The book is a treasury of issues, technical considerations, perspectives, and other must know information. It includes many important topics including a solid historical background with prediction of trends; demystification of fundamental hardware and performance enhancements; application software tradeoffs in management, engineering, and how software relates to hardware; the operating system and its relationship to, and control of, the application software and hardware; synergistic coupling of peripherals with system hardware to enhance applications performance; and the sharing of applications and enhancement of productivity through networks. The open text design is easy to read with many illustrations and practical examples that help clarify difficult computing concepts.  To get the most out of computer resources, office managers, business professionals, students, and desktop computer users at all levels will find Desktop Computers: A Perspective a valuable, even indispensable resource.",

They read passionately, far above their grade level; tackle algebra; and stage Shakespeare so professionally that they often wow the great Shakespearen actor himself, Sir Ian McKellen. Yet Esquith teaches at an L.A. innercity school known as the Jungle, where few of his students speak English at home, and many are from poor or troubled families. What\u2019s his winning recipe? A diet of intensive learning mixed with a lot of kindness and fun. His kids attend class from 6:30 A.M. until well after 4:00 P.M., right through most of their vacations. They take field trips to Europe and Yosemite. They play rock and roll. Mediocrity has no place in their classroom. And the results follow them for life, as they go on to colleges such as Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford. Possessed by a fierce idealism, Esquith works even harder than his students. As an outspoken maverick of public education (his heroes include Huck Finn and Atticus Finch), he admits to significant mistakes and heated fights with administrators and colleagues. We all\u2014teachers, parents, citizens\u2014have much to learn from his candor and uncompromising vision.",

This vision was, of course, the product of his character and his experience. Beethoven the man and Beethoven the composer are not two unconnected entities, and the known history of the man may be used to throw light upon the character of his music.\"Clifton Fadiman has said of this classic study:\"It is the most interesting book on music that I have ever read and it is not written for musical experts; rather for people like myself who like to listen to music but can boast no special knowledge of it. It deals not only with music, on which I do not speak with authority, but with human life in general, about which you and I speak with authority every day of our lives.\"",

        "Description": "The #1 New York Times bestselling author and producer of the Fox television hit, Bones, returns with a spectacular new Tempe Brennan novel.There are 206 bones in the human body. Forensic anthropologists know them intimately, can read in them stories of brief or long lives and use them to reconstruct every kind of violent end. 206 Bones opens with Tempe regaining consciousness and discovering that she is in some kind of very small, very dark, very cold enclosed space. She is bound, hands to feet. Who wants Tempe dead, or at least out of the way, and why? Tempe begins slowly to reconstruct...Tempe and Lieutenant Ryan had accompanied the recently discovered remains of a missing heiress from Montreal to the Chicago morgue. Suddenly, Tempe was accused of mishandling the autopsy -- and the case. Someone made an incriminating phone call. Within hours, the one man with information about the call was dead. Back in Montreal, the corpse of a second elderly woman was found in the woods, and then a third.Seamlessly weaving between Tempe's present-tense terror as she's held captive and her memory of the cases of these murdered women, Reichs conveys the incredible devastation that would occur if a forensic colleague sabotaged work in the lab. The chemistry between Tempe and Ryan intensifies as this complex, riveting tale unfolds. Reichs is writing at the top of her game.Unabridged Compact Disk Includes a Bonus MP3 CD of Kathy Reichs' Deja Dead",

After centuries of building our cities into bustling centers of commerce and culture, we are beginning to slow down. The Road More Traveled shines a new light on the problem of traffic congestion in this easily accessible book. You'll learn how we can reclaim our mobility if we are willing to follow successful examples from overseas, where innovations in infrastructure and privatization have made other nations stronger and more competitive. By thoroughly debunking the myths that keep our policy makers trapped in traffic, the book argues that we can and should build our way out of congestion and into a fast-paced future.",

Known for his versatility, passion and fearlessness, he's become one of our most beloved actors.But in February 2008, Patrick announced he had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. Always a fighter, he refused to let the disease bring him to his knees, and his bravery has inspired both his legion of fans and cancer patients everywhere. Yet this memoir, written with wisdom and heart, recounts much more than his bout with cancer. In vivid detail, Patrick describes his Texas upbringing, his personal struggles, his rise to fame with North and South, his commercial breakthroughs in Dirty Dancing and Ghost, and the soul mate who's stood by his side through it all: his wife, writer and director Lisa Niemi.A behind-the-scenes look at a Hollywood life and a remarkable love, this memoir is both entertainment and inspiration. Patrick and Lisa's marriage is a journey of two lives intertwined and lived as one--throughout their years in Hollywood and at home on their working ranch outside Los Angeles, and culminating in the hope and wisdom they've imparted to all who know them. This book will open the door for families, individuals, and husbands and wives to grow, bond and discover entirely new levels of love and sharing, proving that life shouldn't be lived as a series of endings, but rather as the beginning of greater strength and love.",
