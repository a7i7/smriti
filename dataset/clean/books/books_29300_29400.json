As he grows older, it becomes clear that despite his desire, he lacks the talent, and he faces the painful knowledge that his more gifted friends have already surpassed him.Soon, however, that pain is overshadowed when his older brother, Daniel, finds a strange lump on his neck and Walter realizes that a happy family can change overnight. The year that follows transforms the McClouds, as they try to hold together in the face of the fearful consequences of Daniel's illness, and Walter makes discoveries about himself and his friendships that will change him forever.Decades later, after Walter has left home and returned, he must come to terms with the memories of that year, and grapple once and for all with the challenge of carving out a place for himself in this all-too-familiar world.A moving story of the torments of sexuality and the redemptive power of family and friendship, The Short History of a Prince confirms Jane Hamilton's place as a preeminent novelist of our time.",

        "Description": "Anatoly Dobrynin arrived in Washington in 1962. He was only forty-three, the youngest man ever to serve as Soviet ambassador to the United States. Amazingly he remained in Washington through the presidencies of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan. Dobrynin became the main back channel for the White House and the Kremlin to exchange ideas, negotiate in secret, and set up summit meetings. This arrangement became known as the confidential channel. Through this channel and his more public duties as ambassador he came to know the presidents, their most senior officials, and many members of the American establishment intimately. In Confidence is the story of those relationships.In Confidence is full of revelations that give us new insight into our own history, as well as into the saga of Soviet-American relations. To write it, Dobrynin spent months reviewing his own contemporary notes and official dispatches, as well as extensive material in the Foreign Ministry archives in Moscow. His memoir is an eyewitness document no student of the twentieth century can afford to miss.",

        "Authors": "By Horowitz, Helen Lefkowitz",
        "Description": "M. Carey Thomas (1857-1935) was an extraordinary woman whose career spanned the Victorian and modern worlds.Her story is superbly told in a biography that resonates with the complicated interplay between her necessarily hidden private life and her eminently visible and successful public life as president of Bryn Mawr College, as a founder of the Johns Hopkins medical school and the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, as a leader in the women's suffrage movement, and as the preeminent spokeswoman for education around the turn of the century. Behind closed doors, however, Carey Thomas was by no means the \"proper Quaker daughter\" many of her contemporaries assumed her to be. She was a freethinker. She was an ardent admirer of Swinburne, Rossetti, and the Pre-Raphaelites. She was a passionate woman whose lovers were women.In rich detail and with insight and balance, Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz recounts a life lived outside the bounds of nineteenth-century convention. She shows us the child overcoming a life-threatening and disfiguring burn; the schoolgirl deciding to devote her life to scholarship - and ultimately becoming one of the first American women to study for a doctorate in Germany. We see the Cornell woman - in an age when marriage eliminated the possibility of a serious career - promising her parents to avoid all encounters with men students; the young educator outwitting college trustees to develop her dreams of a rigorous education for women. Throughout, as the book reconstructs Thomas' consciousness and her understanding of herself as a woman of passion, Horowitz provides fresh insights into emotional and sexual life in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Carey Thomas was complexity itself. She was at once visionary and narrow, warm and hard, spontaneous and calculating. She demanded everything of the world and of herself. She brought equal intensity to her professional responsibilities and her personal relations. She lived at fever pitch.Helen Horowitz has given us a brilliant portrait of the vivid and sui generis woman who - in a world that held no models for her - created herself, full scale, in the grand manner.",

        "Authors": "By Somers, Suzanne and Greene, Robert A. (FRW)",
        "Description": "Getting older can be brutal\u2014women gain weight, lose their sex drive, experience hot  flashes, suffer memory loss, become short-tempered, find it difficult to sleep, and  on and on. It\u2019s not so easy for men, either\u2014they start to lose energy and stamina  as they age, too (and they have to live with women going through menopause). After  years of being thin and fit and full of energy, Suzanne herself encountered the \u201cSeven  Dwarfs of Menopause\u201d\u2014Itchy, Bitchy, Sweaty, Sleepy, Bloated, Forgetful, and All-Dried-Up.  Instead of living out the rest of her life cranky, sleep-deprived, and libido-less,  Suzanne set out to discover how she could get her mind, body, and life back and banish  those pesky dwarfs for good. The result is The Sexy Years: Discover the Hormone  Connection\u2014The Secret to Fabulous Sex, Great Health,   and Vitality, for Women and  Men. In this passionately argued and enormously practical book, Suzanne supports  her own research and experiences with the expertise of leading doctors in the field  of women\u2019s and men\u2019s health and sexuality to create an inspiring, accessible call-to-arms  to women to radically rethink how they approach life after fifty, and give them the  tools to turn their lives around.  Suzanne has discovered that the second half of  life has been more rewarding, fun, and purposeful than her younger years. The key  to her happiness? Taking natural bioidentical hormones. Natural hormones, which mimic  the hormones produced in our own bodies that are almost completely lost with aging,  are the answer to the symptoms of menopause that plague women. Recent findings from  the medical community show that synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may  be harmful to women\u2014thus, thousands of women are looking for what else they can do  to alleviate their symptoms. In The Sexy Years, Suzanne comes to the rescue with  a step-by-step plan and detailed information about how women can take control of  their health, for themselves and for their men, including: \u2022 What the differences  are between synthetic and bioidentical hormones, and why bioidentical hormones help  women lose weight, reinvigorate their sex lives, and fight the symptoms of aging \u2022 How doctors do not receive adequate training about hormones and are slaves to the  pharmaceutical industry, and what questions every woman must ask her physician about  hormone replacement therapy and her health \u2022 How Suzanne turned her life around,  with information about how often she visits her doctor, blood work, what hormones  she takes, how to get these hormones, and more \u2022 What male menopause, or andropause,  is and how men can also take bioidentical hormones and regain the energy they had  in their youth \u2022 What a variety of specialists think about natural hormones, health,  and sexuality\u2014Suzanne shares the best advice from these doctors and provides a resource  list of physicians and pharmacies With bioidentical hormone replacement therapy,  Suzanne has found the fountain of youth, the elixir that has made her feel thirty  years old again. In combination with her Somersize diet and fitness plan, which she  also writes about here, Suzanne has never felt better. The beauty of growing older,  she maintains, is that you can combine the wisdom of age with the vitality of youth.  Suzanne makes it perfectly clear how women and men can regain their zest for life  at any age. These really are the sexy years!",

This impassioned dialogue cuts through all the theories, platitudes, and controversies that surround parenting advice to define what every child must have in the first years of life. The authors, both famed advocates for children, lay out the seven irreducible needs of any child, in any society, and confront such thorny questions as: How much time do children need one-on-one with a parent? What is the effect of shifting caregivers, of custody arrangements? Why are we knowingly letting children fail in school? Nothing is off limits, even such an issue as whether every child needs or deserves to be a wanted child. This short, hard-hitting book, the fruit of decades of experience and caring, sounds a wake-up call for parents, teachers, judges, social workers, policy makers-anyone who cares about the welfare of children.",

        "Description": "A Copublication of Seven Stories Press and Akashic BooksThe Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq is the first book to hold the president and his team accountable for the government\u2019s campaign of disinformation leading up to the war in Iraq. The administration repeatedly attested that Saddam Hussein had developed weapons of mass destruction and was close to using them; downplayed the cost and risk of the proposed invasion and occupation; shamelessly evoked the atrocious abuse of power of Hussein and his family while brooking no commitment to rebuild the country after the terrifying \"shock and awe\" campaign, or to do anything to improve the lot of the Iraqi people; and, most outrageously, provided substanceless theory linking Saddam Hussein to the attacks of September 11, thereby cynically manipulating the anger and sorrow of the American citizenry. The charade has culminated in the slow bloodletting of U.S. forces still stationed in Iraq, held there because it would not be politically expedient to admit the failure of \"democratization.\"While Bush II appears intent on conducting an unending global war against \"evildoers,\" little public debate has gone into assessing the aims and strategies of such a broad campaign. In The Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq, coauthors Christopher and Robert Scheer and Lakshmi Chaudhry of the influential web magazine AlterNet.org have aggregated the hard questions that the purported leadership of the U.S. must answer.Christopher Scheer is managing editor of AlterNet.org, the popular news and commentary website. Scheer has written screenplays for Oliver Stone and previously worked for the San Francisco Examiner. Robert Scheer is the author of six books, the host of NPR affiliate KCRW\u2019s \"Left, Right, and Center,\" and a contributing editor to both the Los Angeles Times and The Nation.

Following the flood, survivors from a previously tightly knit community were crowded into trailer homes with no concern for former neighborhoods. The result was a collective trauma that lasted longer than the individual traumas caused by the original disaster. Making extensive use of the words of the people themselves, Erikson details the conflicting tensions of mountain life in general\u2014the tensions between individualism and dependency, self-assertion and resignation, self-centeredness and group orientation\u2014and examines the loss of connection, disorientation, declining morality, rise in crime, rise in out-migration, etc., that resulted from the sudden loss of neighborhood.",

But when gay developers from Man-hattan, searching for a new place for summer shares and tea dances, get a look at its gently curving beaches, they hatch an ingenious plan to transform the sleepy Rhode Island hideaway into the next gay hotspot. If only someone would tell the townsfolk.As a contingent of gym-buffed and cell-phone-toting vacationers descends on the village, some locals are outraged, others strangely titillated. Hollis Wynbourne, a reclusive antiques dealer and longtime subject of gossip, is drawn from his cocoon by the sight of sunbathing beauties; wealthy Wesley Herndon suddenly finds the town overrun with his two favorite attractions, frisky hunks and yachts of pedigree; and Anthony, a callow eighteen-year-old, embarks on a sentimental education he never expected to get in his own backyard. An uproarious send-up of both small-town provincialism and the absurdities of contemporary gay life, The Summer They Came will capture you with its portrait of a town you thought you knew, run amuck.",

But this is the first to take the reader, through a mother's eyes, into the day-to-day life of a child with ADD and its dynamics in the home and beyond.Ann Colin's compelling journal recounts her son Willie's first five years of life. Willie is intelligent, creative, affectionate, and amusing. He is also overly excitable and belligerent. We follow Colin and her husband from school to school, doctor to doctor, seeking a correct diagnosis - from an insensitive preschool staff, to the psychologist who pronounces Willie brain-damaged when he walks on tiptoe, to the seesaw of medical opinion on treatment and drugs.It is a marathon that takes them from bewilderment and exhaustion, through coping, to triumph. For a family facing ADD or any other crisis, and for educators and therapists, Willie is an inspiration and a lifesaver.",

And yet, most of what we know about it is wrong. The details of the Plague etched in the minds of terrified schoolchildren -- the hideous black welts, the high fever, and the awful end by respiratory failure -- are more or less accurate. But what the Plague really was and how it made history remain shrouded in a haze of myths.Now, Norman Cantor, the premier historian of the Middle Ages, draws together the most recent scientific discoveries and groundbreaking historical research to pierce the mist and tell the story of the Black Death as a gripping, intimate narrative.",

        "Description": "One of the most accomplished literary artists of our time, John Crowley has given us fiction that illuminates and astounds -- from the wonder and whimsy of Little, Big to the poignancy and lyrical beauty of The Translator. Now he turns his unique genius in a different direction to imagine the novel the great, haunted, and enigmatic Romanticpoet Lord Byron never penned ... but very well might have.Documents discovered in a rotting old trunk in an English storage room prove that the manuscript of a novel by Byron once existed, and that it was saved from destruction, read, and annotated by Ada, Countess of Lovelace, a brilliant mathematician and Byron's abandoned daughter, during the final, agonizing months of her young life. While the curious mystery of what became of the manuscript itself is explored, we are permitted to read it -- the whole of Byron's only novel -- beginning to end.And what a novel it is -- a thrilling romance chock-full of treacheries and deceits, loves and fortunes gloriously gained and tragically lost; a tale of blood, vengeance, and mystery, of thrilling escapes and ruthless murder. Yet in the story of Ali -- the bastard son of the demonic Lord Sane, torn from his life in high Albania to be raised a proper, if penniless, English gentleman -- Ada finds gripping revelations of its author's hidden character, and glimpses into the secrets of his soul.John Crowley's masterly creation is, in itself, a stunning and unprecedented act of literary impersonation. But Lord Byron's Novel is much more, weaving strands from different centuries into an extraordinary tapestry of loss and discovery, and the powerful, invisible threads that eternally bind parent to child. It is the story of a dying daughter's poignant attempt to understand the famous absent father she longed for to her last day, and the contemporary tale of the determined young woman who, by learning the secret of Byron's manuscript and Ada's devotion, reconnects with her own father, who was driven from her life by a crime as terrible as any Byron was accused of.  John Crowley's novel is a wonder -- a modern masterwork that moves, enlightens, and satisfies on every  level.",

On the planet Entibor, he found shelter and domestic tranquillity with his old love, Elaeli Inadi, at the price of what he had left behind: a dispersed and shattered Mage-Circle, an estranged brother who had tried to kill him, and a homeworld on the cusp of massive cultural upheaval.Now the bill is coming due, and Arekhon finds himself impelled homeward by strange dreams and prophetic visions. The Great Working - the effort to do the unthinkable and reunite a galaxy long sundered by the Gap Between - remains incomplete, left unfinished in the aftermath of the dissolution of Arekhon's Mage-Circle. But too much energy and too many lives have been poured into the Working already, and it cannot end so long as any of the Circle members remain alive and bound into it.Home, unfortunately, isn't a safe place for Arekhon to be at the moment. For Eraasi has changed - and the great fleet-families at the center of Eraasian culture are girding for war.",

        "Title": "Abide With Me: A Novel (Invisible Life Trilogy)",
        "Authors": "By Harris, E. Lynn",
        "Description": "The Invisible Life Trilogy In three linked novels\u2014 Invisible Life , Just As I Am , and Abide With Me \u2014E. Lynn Harris opens the door to a world rarely depicted in popular literature, the gay and bisexual black community. Written with sensitivity and sass, the novels have all appeared on the Blackboard bestseller list and have won enthusiastic acclaim from critics and a broad range of readers. The questions, discussion topics, and suggested reading list that follow are designed to enhance your reading group's discussion of the books and the insights they offer into the lives of men and women, gay and straight, as they face such universal problems as finding and keeping love, making the right career choices, and dealing with sometimes difficult parents, co-workers, and friends. At the center of the Invisible Life trilogy is Raymond Tyler, a man struggling to do the right thing without betraying his past or sacrificing his dreams. The son of a successful lawyer in Birmingham, Alabama, Raymond always assumed he would follow in his father's footsteps. His life takes an unexpected turn, however, when he finds himself attracted to a handsome fraternity brother at college. Their carefully cloaked relationship\u2014at once confusing, exhilarating, and frightening\u2014marks the first step in Raymond's journey toward self-discovery and self-acceptance. It is a journey that takes him from the tradition-bound South to the uninhibited world of gay Manhattan, to a thriving Seattle, where his legal career and his love-life seem destined for lasting success. Along the way, Raymond encounters a rich and diverse array of people, including the flamboyant, openly gay Kyle; the beautiful, loving Nicole, an aspiring actress; and Basil, a dashing and dangerous football player. Their stories join with Raymond's in a fast-paced chronicle that proves that love, friendship, and sexual desire frequently defy conventional expectations and explanations. Harris's novels not only recount the changes and choices the individual characters confront, they evoke in telling detail the society in which those choices are made. From the importance of church and family to the consequences of biases based on skin color, sexual orientation, and gender, Harris uncovers the ties that bind and the issues that divide the African American community today.",

        "Authors": "By Barber, Benjamin R and Schulz, Andrea (EDT)",
        "Description": "Jihad vs. McWorld is a groundbreaking work, an elegant and illuminating analysis of the central conflict of our times: consumerist capitalism versus religious and tribal fundamentalism. These diametrically opposed but strangely intertwined forces are tearing apart--and bringing together--the world as we know it, undermining democracy and the nation-state on which it depends. On the one hand, consumer capitalism on the global level is rapidly dissolving the social and economic barriers between nations, transforming the world's diverse populations into a blandly uniform market. On the other hand, ethnic, religious, and racial hatreds are fragmenting the political landscape into smaller and smaller tribal units. Jihad vs. McWorld is the term that distinguished writer and political scientist Benjamin R. Barber has coined to describe the powerful and paradoxical interdependence of these forces. In this important new book, he explores the alarming repercussions of this potent dialectic for democracy.A work of persuasive originality and penetrating insight, Jihad vs. McWorld holds up a sharp, clear lens to the dangerous chaos of the post-Cold War world. Critics and political leaders have already heralded Benjamin R. Barber's work for its bold vision and moral courage. Jihad vs. McWorld is an essential text for anyone who wants to understand our troubled present and the crisis threatening our future.",

        "Authors": "By Roberts, Arthur O.",
        "Description": "\"If you have ever wondered whether the idea of heaven is merely a theoretical human construct, then this book is for you. If you have ever entertained doubts or questions about a future existence after this life, then this book is for you. If you have ever thought of heaven's residents as rather dull, ethereal beings perched on billowing clouds strumming golden harps, then this book is for you. If you have ever imagined heaven to be simply one never-ending worship service, then this book is for you.\" -- from the Introduction by Richard J. FosterAs long as people have lived, they have dreamed and wondered about the life that comes after this one. In Exploring Heaven, Arthur O. Roberts distills the best of Christian thought and speculation to answer the age-old questions about eternal life. Drawing from a wealth of timeless wisdom, Roberts not only sketches out the overwhelming evidence that eternal life is a reality, he also describes everything from heaven's location and its inhabitants to the nature and rhythm of eternal life.Speculating about heaven can be a risky business, but Roberts is firmly grounded in Christian tra-dition and classical scholarship. Part philosopher and part pastor, he employs biblical evidence, scientific proofs, personal anecdotes, and philo-sophical musings to create a complete and prag-matic picture of life after death. While the heaven he depicts is a place filled with joy and worship, it is hardly a fairyland of clouds and harps where the saved lounge about for eternity. Instead, he believes humans will work, play, socialize, and learn, continuing the process of discipleship started on earth. And unlike philosophers who dismiss physi-cal bodies as so much excess baggage, Roberts be-lieves that we will continue to inhabit our (greatly enhanced) bodies after death. Indeed, we will live much as we do now, with one key exception: heaven will be free of sin.Both pragmatic and celebratory, equal parts wise and inspiring, Exploring Heaven will appeal to everyone who has ever wondered about the nature of eternal life.",

Everyone has their own experiences, but we eventually share one common bond -- we all make it through these restless teenage years, and somehow, we all survive. We all walk that thin line between adult and child trying to steady ourselves on our own two feet. We all have bad-hair days and broken-heart days and I-wish-I-were-somebody-else days. We all stress out over school and work and learning to drive and looking good and fitting in. We all learn the hard way that people and moments don't last forever and that pimples are just a part of life. We all struggle with friends who get in way over their heads, and we all struggle with parents who constantly bug us about being in way over their heads, and we all struggle with parents who constantly bug us about being in way over our own. We al want to be the most popular, the prettiest, the smartest, the most athletic, and the best and most perfect at everything we do. And somehow, we all make it out alive with great memories, great friendships, and great stories.BEING A TEEN is one girl's account of her teen years that will help make your own experience a little bit easier. Young enough to remember all the gruesome and hilarious details, but old enough  to reflect on those years with a bit of insight, author Diane Mastromarino has filled the pages of this book with her own teen tales, as well as poetry and quotations written by teens and famous authors. It is a book you will learn from, laugh at, and, without a doubt, relate to. BEING A TEEN is the perfect companion, offering the advice you need to hear, the laughter to keep you going, and the reassurance that you are not going through this alone.",

He suggests that the cybernetic theory of decision as developed in such diverse fields as information theory, mathematical logic, and behavioral psychology generates a systematic but non-rational analysis that seems to explain quite naturally decisions that are puzzling when viewed from the rational perspective. When combined with the basic understanding of human mental operations developed in cognitive psychology, the cybernetic theory of decision presents a striking picture of how decision makers deal with the intense uncertainty and fundamental value conflicts that arise in bureaucratic politics. To illustrate the advantages of using cybernetic theory, Steinbruner analyzes the issue of sharing nuclear weapons among the NATO allies.",
