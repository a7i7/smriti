While nothing is fail-safe, there are things you can do to halt the downward slide in your family. This book gives dynamic biblical solutions to people who are asking: - Why don't I have passion in my spiritual life? - Is it still possible to restore my marriage? - Can I raise my children to be \"on fire\" for God? - Where do I start?  Bruce Wilkinson shows how, in the midst of a society without morals, a passionate relationship with Jesus is possible -- not just a \"mountaintop experience,\" but an everyday vibrant relationship. This popular book is newly released with an updated cover!",

        "Description": "Love and marriage are the concerns of Shakespeare\u2019s The Taming of the Shrew. Lucentio\u2019s marriage to Bianca is prompted by his idealized love of an apparently ideal woman. Petruchio\u2019s wooing of Katherine, however, is free of idealism. Petruchio takes money from Bianca\u2019s suitors to woo her, since Katherine must marry before her sister by her father\u2019s decree; he also arranges the dowry with her father. Petruchio is then ready to marry Katherine, even against her will. Katherine, the shrew of the play\u2019s title, certainly acts much changed. But have she and Petruchio learned to love each other? Or is the marriage based on terror and deception? The authoritative edition of The Taming of the Shrew from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play\u2019s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare\u2019s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library\u2019s vast holdings of rare books -An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading Essay by Karen Newman The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world\u2019s largest collection of Shakespeare\u2019s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

The second reason is even simpler.  Christian discipleship is Christian stewardship.  How could it be anything else?  How else do God's people grow in grace?\"In the tradition of Schaller's many other top-selling books, 44 Ways to Expand the Financial Base of Your Congregation contains strategies tested and proven in scores of local congregations across the U.S. and Canada.  The 44 strategies are humorously illustrated by Edward Lee Tucker's \"Friar Tuck\" cartoon characters.",

With his famous insight, lucidity, and redoubtable grasp of history, Chomsky offers his views on the invasion and occupation of Iraq, the doctrine of \"preemptive\" strikes against so-called rogue states, and the prospects of the second Bush administration, warning of the growing threat to international peace posed by the U.S. drive for domination. In his inimitable style, Chomsky also dissects the propaganda system that fabricates a mythic past and airbrushes inconvenient facts out of history.Barsamian, recipient of the ACLU's Upton Sinclair Award for independent journalism, has conducted more interviews and radio broadcasts with Chomsky than has any other journalist. Enriched by their unique rapport, Imperial Ambitions explores topics Chomsky has never before discussed, among them the 2004 presidential campaign and election, the future of Social Security, and the increasing threat, including devastating weather patterns, of global warming. The result is an illuminating dialogue with one of the leading thinkers of our time\u2014and a startling picture of the turbulent times in which we live.",

Thinking herself impervious to romance of any kind, Emma tries to arrange a wealthy marriage for poor Harriet, but refuses to recognize her own feelings for the gallant Mr. Knightley. What ensues is a delightful series of scheming escapades in which every social machination and bit of \"tittle-tattle\" is steeped in Austen's delicious irony. Ultimately, Emma discovers that \"Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common.\"&&LBR&&R&&LBR&&RVirginia Woolf called Jane Austen \"the most perfect artist among women,\" and Emma Woodhouse is arguably her most perfect creation. Though Austen found her heroine to be a person whom \"no one but myself will much like,\" &&LI&&REmma&&L/I&&R is her most cleverly woven, riotously comedic, and pleasing novel of manners.&&LBR&&R&&LBR&&R&&L/P&&R&&LP style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"&&R&&LSTRONG&&RSteven Marcus&&L/B&&R&&L/B&&R is Professor of English and Comparative Literature and George Delacorte Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, and a specialist in nineteenth-century literature and culture.
