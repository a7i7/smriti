        "Title": "An American Place: Celebrating the Flavors of America",
        "Authors": "By Forgione, Larry",
        "Description": "Larry Forgione, hailed as the godfather of American cooking, is a man with one passion: to reintroduce the essential American flavors lost to us in the rush for newer, quicker, and better. This culinary visionary, largely responsible for the rebirth of farmers' markets across America and the availability of such quality ingredients as free-range chicken and the field green salad, has finally produced his master cookbook. Sure to become the primer that will inspire a whole new generation of American cooks, An American Place returns traditional American cuisine to its rightful place at the pinnacle of vigorous and soul-satisfying flavor. Forgione takes the best flavors from the past and revitalizes them with the freshest, ripest, and richest native ingredients. Here are nearly three hundred mouthwatering recipes that celebrate the real bounty of American cooking: fish and shellfish from America's shores, everything from chicken, duck, and venison to beef, pork, and lamb from our forests and our farms, and wonderful breads and old-fashioned desserts from our bakeshops. When food industry people want to know what's going to be happening in American food next year, they call Larry Forgione. In An American Place, in addition to revitalizing traditional fare, he also offers food that won't remind you of anything you've ever tasted before. Forgione's recipes will surprise you, delight you, inspire you, and show you what today's outstanding American ingredients, used imaginatively, can pro, duce: rich Roasted Corn and Beef Soup, an elegant Lobster and Fennel in Napa Cabbage Leaves, silken Pumpkin-Corn Pudding, Scalloped Ginger Sunchokes, Pork with Peppered Apples and Onions, tart and tangy Key Lime Chiffon Angel Food Cake. His main courses, like Salmon with Cracked Wheat Crust, Breast of Chicken with Artichoke Sauce, and Grilled Spring Lamb with Rhubarb and Dandelion, offer complex and vibrant tastes that are light, healthful, and simple to cook. Dishes such as Sauteed Shrimp with Watercress, Warm Smoked Trout Salad, and Grilled Chicken with Summer Vegetable Compote will bring you delicious and impressive results without your having to spend hours in the kitchen, Forgione's American food not only tastes good, it feels good, with comfort food like sublime cod cakes and tartar sauce, and the creamiest of golden hashed brown potatoes. There's food that will remind you of the homey kind of favorites that your mother cooked (or wished she had): a thick, pureed vegetable soup, warm chicken salad, Apple Pandowdy, Spiced Ginger Ice Cream. Here also are recipes that belong to the \"bring them back alive\" school of American heritage: dishes like Waldorf Salad, Old-Fashioned Caesar Salad, Baked Lobster Savannah, and Fried Ipswich Clams that Forgione returns to their former greatness. And here also are some rare and wondrous dishes from the past for which the wisdom was knowing when to leave well enough alone. The Old-Fashioned Strawberry Shortcake recipe offered here is just the way it started out years ago: the best unsweetened whipped cream, the ripest berries, and a home-baked biscuit. Forgione's passionate return to freshness has given birth to such cottage industries as local goat cheese producers, growers of specialty berries and field lettuces, the proliferaton of smoked and cured fish and shellfish of all kinds, the return of old-fashioned apple varieties, even the raising of buffalo, which he brought back to the American menu nearly a full century since it last appeared. An American Place is, hands down, the most important American cookbook of the decade.",

        "Title": "Judy Garland: The Secret Life of an American Legend",
        "Authors": "By Shipman, David",
        "Description": "This is the most revealing and controversial biography ever published about Judy Garland. There have been many books about her, but you have never met the real Judy until now.In the hearts and minds of millions, she will always be Dorothy, the girl next door who traveled over the rainbow. But Judy's life behind the cameras and beyond the gaze of her fans was often filled with suffering. The ungainly daughter of mismatched parents - an ambitious mother and a gentle gay father - Frances Gumm and her sisters did the vaudeville circuit all over the country, and her voice eventually got her a movie contract. Judy Garland (as she was renamed) won fame serenading Clark Gable - then she went on to win everyone's heart in The Wizard of Oz.Judy was MGM's greatest asset. With a voice unparalleled in show business, she hoofed with the best of them and also showed enormous talent and sensitivity as an actress. To protect their prize star the studio advised Judy to take pills - diet pills to keep her naturally heavy body in line, sleeping pills to sleep, uppers to wake her up in the artificially early movie-making mornings. Judy soon got hooked on pills and booze - a lifelong problem that eventually killed her in 1969.Here is the first true portrait of the dark side of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Based on research from many firsthand sources, Judy Garland is the most unflinchingly detailed account to date of Judy's career ups and downs, emotional turmoil, tempestuous marriages, and severe addictions. Garland made several suicide attempts and had many abortions, notably one after an affair with a famous bisexual actor. Judy Garland reveals Judy's bisexuality. Many of her lovers were gay men, and she frequently turned to other women for romantic solace.But although she had heartaches, Judy had many triumphs as well. Judy Garland has vivid behind-the-scenes accounts of the making of The Wizard of Oz, A Star Is Born, Meet Me in St. Louis, and her other film masterpieces. Judy had a dazzling concert career, and her records still brighten the lives of her admirers almost twenty-five years after her death.Filled with fresh insights and illustrated with astonishing photographs. Judy Garland is riveting, balanced, and authoritative - unquestionably the definitive biography of the woman many consider to be the greatest entertainer of the twentieth century.",

        "Description": "More Civil War Curiosities contains strange but true stories from the four-year conflict that raged across a one-thousand-mile battle front with more than three million men in uniform. Anything could and often did happen. Webb Garrison recounts instances of friendly fire casualties, the unperfected art of spying, banishments and deportings, grisly tales of missing limbs, name changes for both people and ships, disguises that worked (and some that did not), and many \"firsts\" and \"lasts.\"Fragging, or purposely killing a fellow soldier, was the probable cause of the death of Thomas Wilson, a tyrannical Federal general. He died in action at the battle of Baton Rouge when, according to one account, he was seized by a group of his own men who held him in front of a cannon before it was fired at the enemy.When Confederate Gen. Jubal Early marched on Frederick, Maryland, he offered not to torch the town for a payment of $200,000. It took the townspeople a day to borrow the money?and 87 years to pay it back. When Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, failed to raise a ransom of $500,000, Early's subordinate, Gen. John McCausland, burned the town to the ground.The arm of Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson was amputated when he was wounded at the battle of Chancellorsville. Following the operation, Jackson's corps chaplain gave the arm a respectful burial?complete with a gravestone?in his family's cemetery. When the general died a week later, the rest of him was buried in Lexington, Virginia.Hiram Ulysses Grant was mistakenly listed as Ulysses Simpson Grant by the congressman appointing him to West Point. Grant did not protest, and the name stayed with him all the way to the presidency of the United States.",

        "Title": "The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World",
        "Authors": "By Greenspan, Alan",
        "Description": "In the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, in his fourteenth year as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan took part in a very quiet collective effort to ensure that America didn't experience an economic meltdown, taking the rest of the world with it. There was good reason to fear the worst: the stock market crash of October 1987, his first major crisis as Federal Reserve Chairman, coming just weeks after he assumed control, had come much closer than is even today generally known to freezing the financial system and triggering a genuine financial panic. But the most remarkable thing that happened to the economy after 9/11 was...nothing. What in an earlier day would have meant a crippling shock to the system was absorbed astonishingly quickly. After 9/11 Alan Greenspan knew, if he needed any further reinforcement, that we're living in a new world - the world of a global capitalist economy that is vastly more flexible, resilient, open, self-directing, and fast-changing than it was even 20 years ago. It's a world that presents us with enormous new possibilities but also enormous new challenges. The Age of Turbulence is Alan Greenspan's incomparable reckoning with the nature of this new world - how we got here, what we're living through, and what lies over the horizon, for good and for ill-channeled through his own experiences working in the command room of the global economy for longer and with greater effect than any other single living figure. He begins his account on that September 11th morning, but then leaps back to his childhood, and follows the arc of his remarkable life's journey through to his more than 18-year tenure as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, from 1987 to 2006, during a time of transforming change. Alan Greenspan shares the story of his life first simply with an eye toward doing justice to the extraordinary amount of history he has experienced and shaped. But his other goal is to draw readers along the same learning curve he followed, so they accrue a grasp of his own understanding of the underlying dynamics that drive world events. In the second half of the book, having brought us to the present and armed us with the conceptual tools to follow him forward, Dr. Greenspan embarks on a magnificent tour de horizon of the global economy. He reveals the universals of economic growth, delves into the specific facts on the ground in each of the major countries and regions of the world, and explains what the trend-lines of globalization are from here. The distillation of a life's worth of wisdom and insight into an elegant expression of a coherent worldview, The Age of Turbulence will stand as Alan Greenspan's personal and intellectual legacy.",

        "Description": "Whether or not you know or even understand it, you are living a life of faith. Perhaps not the conventional, Christian ideal of faith, but faith nonetheless. You flip the light switch and have faith that the light will come on. You turn the key and expect the engine to start. But what about the big things in life? Do you have faith that you'll remain healthy? Faith that your children will be safe from violence? We all face situations that we cannot control. All we can do is trust-and have faith-that God will see us through.Rather than a complicated, theological enigma, Sheila Walsh explains that faith is a simple, life-giving gift God offers His children. And since it is a gift, He expects us to share it-to give it away. By sharing biblical and modern examples of women of faith, Sheila opens our eyes to the extravagant gift God has for each of us.",

        "Description": "Philip Roth's new novel is a candidly intimate yet universal story of loss, regret, and stoicism. The best-selling author of The Plot Against America now turns his attention from \"one family's harrowing encounter with history\" (New York Times) to one man's lifelong skirmish with mortality.The fate of Roth's everyman is traced from his first shocking confrontation with death on the idyllic beaches of his childhood summers, through the family trials and professional achievements of his vigorous adulthood, and into his old age, when he is rended by observing the deterioration of his contemporaries and stalked by his own physical woes.A successful commercial artist with a New York ad agency, he is the father of two sons from a first marriage who despise him and a daughter from a second marriage who adores him. He is the beloved brother of a good man whose physical well-being comes to arouse his bitter envy, and he is the lonely ex-husband of three very different women with whom he's made a mess of marriage. In the end he is a man who has become what he does not want to be.The terrain of this powerful novel -- Roth's twenty-seventh book and the fifth to be published in the twenty-first century -- is the human body. Its subject is the common experience that terrifies us all.Everyman takes its title from an anonymous fifteenth-century allegorical play, a classic of early English drama, whose theme is the summoning of the living to death.",

        "Description": "\"See to it, Blackwood,\" says the Cardinal Archbishop of Chicago, and Blackie Ryan, the Cardinal's auxiliary bishop, doesn't exactly jump (he never jumps), rather he moseys down to Washington, D.C., where one of his friends, Jack Patrick McGurn, called \"Machine Gun McGurn\" by the media, has surprisingly just been elected president and needs his help.Blackie's first confrontation is with Washington bureaucracy; the powers that be don't want to give Blackie a pass to wander in and out of the Oval Office at will. The bureaucracy blinks first and Blackie gets his pass.Blackie, who can do anything, has been called on to deal with ghosts in the White House. Yes, poltergeists. But there are more problems in the White House than ghosts. A conspiracy abroad in the land results in two men trying to blow up the White House. Happily, Blackie has one of his intuitive moments and manages to get a picture of the terrorists, and he didn't forget to take the cap off his camera. He also got the license number of the getaway car. Blackie also has to deal with four enchantingly beautiful women who, without knowing it, may be responsible for the strange ghostlike behavior of an unhappy spirit. None of these things does Blackie find daunting. He stumbles about his business and waits for enlightenment to come. The Bishop in the West Wing is one of the finest of the Blackie Ryan stories .We meet again a great cast of characters: Sean Cronin, the Cardinal Archbishop of Chicago, who is turning out to be one of the treasures of modern American detective fiction; Mike Casey, the cop turned painter, and Dr. Kate Murphy, Blackie's beautiful and terrifyingly smart sister. With this cast of characters the poor ghosts deserve our pity.Andrew Greeley was a guest at the White House three times during the most recent administration and his keen eye and powers of observation are put to remarkable use in this latest Blackie Ryan mystery/adventure.",

        "Authors": "By Beck, Martha Nibley",
        "Description": "Leaving the Saints is an unforgettable memoir about one woman\u2019s spiritual quest and journey toward faith. As \u201cMormon royalty\u201d within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Martha Beck was raised in a home frequented by the Church\u2019s high elders\u2014known as the apostles\u2014and her existence was framed by their strict code of conduct. Wearing her sacred garments, she married in a secret temple ceremony\u2014but only after two Mormon leaders ascertained that her \u201cpast contained no flirtation with serious sins, such as committing murder or drinking coffee.\u201d She went to church faithfully with the other brothers and sisters of her ward. When her son was born with Down syndrome, she and her husband left their graduate programs at Harvard to return to Provo, Utah, where they knew the supportive Mormon community would embrace them.However, soon after Martha began teaching at Brigham Young University, she began to see firsthand the Church\u2019s ruthlessness as it silenced dissidents and masked truths that contradicted its published beliefs. Most troubling of all, she was forced to face her history of sexual abuse by one of the Church\u2019s most prominent authorities. This book chronicles her difficult decision to sever her relationship with the faith that had cradled her for so long and to confront and forgive the person who betrayed her so deeply. This beautifully written, inspiring memoir explores the powerful yearning toward faith. It offers a rare glimpse inside one of the world\u2019s most secretive religions while telling a profoundly moving story of personal courage, survival, and the transformative power of spirituality.",

        "Authors": "By Thompson, Michael and Barker, Teresa",
        "Description": "The push for students to excel at school and get into the best colleges has never been more intense. In this invaluable new book, the bestselling co-author of Raising Cain addresses America\u2019s performance-driven obsession with the accomplishments of its kids\u2013and provides a deeply humane response.\u201cHow was school?\u201d These three words contain a world of desire on the part of parents to know what their children are learning and experiencing in school each day. Children may not divulge much, but psychologist Michael Thompson suggests that the answers are there if we know how to read the clues and\u2013equally important\u2013if we remember our own school days.School, Thompson reminds us, occupies more waking hours than kids spend at home; and school is full not just of studies but of human emotion\u2013excitement, fear, envy, love, anger, sexuality, boredom, competitiveness. Through richly detailed interviews, case histories, and student e-mail journals, including those of his own children, Thompson illuminates the deeper psychological journey that school demands, a journey that all children must take in order to grow and develop, whether they are academic aces or borderline dropouts. Most of us remember this journey, if we are honest with ourselves, but our children must experience it in their own way, for better or worse.In stories that are by turns poignant, shocking, uplifting, and inspiring, we see students grapple with the textured reality of their lives, devising their own unique strategies to survive and thrive in school. For parents, this book reveals the hidden emotional landscape of the school day and points toward the answers we both desire and dread as we seek to help our children find success in school and beyond.Bridging the worlds of the growing and the grown-up, and told in Thompson\u2019s compassionate voice as both psychologist and father, The Pressured Child shows us how to listen for the truth of our children\u2019s experience\u2013and how to trust, love, and ultimately let go of a child. It is a crucial book for our stressful age\u2013and an ideal resource for families struggling to survive it.",

Together, these four friends keep a collective journal they call \"If This World Were Mine,\" and share their personal diaries each month at a gathering filled with humor, gossip, and affirmation.But after five years, the once-strong bonds of friendship are weakening, and the group must handle challenges of work, lost love, and a stranger in their midst: gray-eyed John Basil Henderson, a former NFL star whose past has begun to haunt him. As the group members confront their true feelings toward each other, resentments and long-held secrets surface, and the stability of the group begins to disintegrate. When one of them faces death, the crisis forces the friends to recognize and accept the inner strength that the group has nurtured in each of them.

Emily is the middle child, restless and divorced, the one who every one assumed would be the first after Mudear to crack. The youngest is wild Annie Ruth, a TV anchorwoman who is pregnant out of wedlock and plagued by visions of menacing cats. Ernest, their father, is a kaolin mine worker who is so overwhelmed by all the females around him that sometimes he just wants to yell out, \"Womens taking over my house!\"As the sisters reminisce, they are unaware that even though Mudear's body is laid out in Parkinson Funeral Home, she is not so easily buried. Her spirit refuses to die, and she floats around Mulberry, watching her daughters stretched out on her porch smoking cigarettes, drinking her husband's liquor from her best glasses, and talking about marijuana like \"some damn black girl hippies.\"In alternating voices, each member of the Lovejoy family tells us what preys on his or her mind. As they prepare for the memorial, sit up with the body, and at the funeral itself, each must come to grips with her relationship to Mudear. At the same time, each must define what a mother, a black mother - their mother - is.",

Her lucrative auto factory job has brought her a spectacular home in Detroit and a promising future for her four lively children. Yet Ginger can no longer ignore the restlessness deep within her soul - the education she put aside, the goals she never quite attained, the dreams she deferred to help those who depended on her the most. It's time she realized her own talents and identity through the challenges of the white-collar world just within her grasp.But Ginger soon finds there is no leaving behind the pain and insecurities of the past... or the family ties that seem to strengthen and limit her all at once. And she soon discovers that her love for Jackson - whose jealousy and controlling nature threaten far more than her dreams - may be a heartbreaking illusion that no amount of passion can sustain. Knowing everything she cherishes is at stake, Ginger must chart the farthest limits of responsibility, ambition, and love - and perhaps find a fulfillment only the hardest of choices can bring.",

In Reflections of Heaven, Shockey shares the most compelling accounts he has heard over the past decade, and also offers profound insight into what the increasing presence of the divine in daily life can mean in the new millennium.Beginning with his own personal story, Shockey goes on to introduce others who relate their miraculous experiences, ranging from visions of heaven to the presence of angels. He then puts these encounters in an enlightening context as he explores discernible patterns of divine intervention in history, as well as in the Bible. In doing so, he takes readers on an unforgettable spiritual odyssey that will change the way they look at the here-and-now--and the hereafter.",

This fascinating book, assembled by the editors of the journal First Things, explores the religious and social development of the West during the past one thousand years by looking at ten people who defined the millennium. Written by a team of renowned scholars, the book treats the second millennium century by century, choosing one historical figure as the prism through which to view each period. While the individuals chosen are not necessarily \"representative\" figures--in some instances they are people who opposed the \"spirit of the times\"--the compelling personalities limned in these chapters help us to understand better where we have come so far. Insightful, authoritative, and a pleasure to read, these narratives not only open intriguing windows on key dimensions of the Christian West but also provide a panoramic view from which to comprehend all of modern history--a view well worth pondering as we begin the third one thousand years.",

And while many more have been created, increasingly, the jobs that are disappearing are those of higher-paid, white-collar workers, and many of the new jobs pay much less than those they replaced.What is going on?To find out, The New York Times sent a team of reporters across the country, to interview workers and managers and owners alike, to see how they have survived the economic storms that have left a trail of anguish and upheaval. Their report, after a six-month investigation, originally appeared in a critically acclaimed seven-part series in The New York Times.Now, expanded as a book, The Downsizing of America makes for riveting reading. It puts a human face on a historic predicament that is as ubiquitous as it is painful. It is a revealing look at an America in which the rules of the game seem to be drastically changed.",

Today, we are preoccupied with?and increasingly divided over?how to cope with the problems of poor and dependent Americans, most of whom cannot or will not work at the jobs available. Mead provides overwhelming and disturbing evidence that passive poverty?the failure of most of the poor to work at all?reflects defeatism more than lack of opportunity. In this controversial book, Mead proposes concrete steps to overcome the inertia of the nonworking poor trapped in the welfare system. If the poor return to work, he suggests, American politics would focus once again on the problems of the working Americans.",
