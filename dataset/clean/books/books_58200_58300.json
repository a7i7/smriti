        "Description": "An ambitious fiction debut filled with lust, longing, and moral depravity.The tales in Too Beautiful for You, Rod Liddle\u2019s dazzling debut, sweep readers into the lives of characters whose sexual frustrations and deviant desires lead them to the very edge of acceptable behavior\u2014and sometimes way beyond.In a mischievous, macabre tale about a man who loses his arm in an accident on the way back from an assignation, Liddle shows just how far a husband will go to hide his infidelity from his wife. Another philandering husband, operating much closer to home, doesn\u2019t let fleeting pangs of guilt curtail his hunger for the sexual treats proffered by his mother-in-law. Bizarre happenings are not confined to the sexually adventuresome: one woman notices that her skin is hardening into a sort of insect carapace after she uses a depilatory gel; a suicide bomber is forced to acknowledge his abysmal failure as a terrorist when he tries to blow up a Jewish art gallery with a package of trout; and a man planning to jump out a window finds some of his colleagues all too ready to assist him. Liddle presents his panoply of misfits and miscreants without passing judgment. The passions they harbor and the acts they commit may be shocking and scandalous, but Liddle shows that these hapless men and women are not so very different from the rest of us. Sharp-witted, sexy, and psychologically astute, Too Beautiful for You breaks through literary and social taboos with style and humor, reminiscent of the early work of Martin Amis.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Description": "New York Times bestselling authors Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen conclude their inventive trilogy with this remarkable answer to the great \u201cwhat if\u201d of the American Civil War: Could the South have indeed won? After his great victories at Gettysburg and Union Mills, General Robert E. Lee\u2019s attempt to bring the war to a final conclusion by attacking Washington, D.C., fails. However, in securing Washington, the remnants of the valiant Union Army of the Potomac, under the command of the impetuous General Dan Sickles, is trapped and destroyed. For Lincoln there is only one hope left: that General Ulysses S. Grant can save the Union cause. It is now August 22, 1863. Lincoln and Grant are facing a collapse of political will to continue the fight to preserve the Union. Lee, desperately short of manpower, must conserve his remaining strength while maneuvering for the killing blow that will take Grant\u2019s army out of the fight and, at last, bring a final and complete victory for the South. Pursuing the remnants of the defeated Army of the Potomac up to the banks of the Susquehanna, Lee is caught off balance when news arrives that General Ulysses S. Grant, in command of more than seventy thousand men, has crossed that same river, a hundred miles to the northwest at Harrisburg. As General Grant brings his Army of the Susquehanna into Maryland, Robert E. Lee\u2019s Army of Northern Virginia maneuvers for position. Grant first sends General George Armstrong Custer on a mad dash to block Lee\u2019s path toward Frederick and with it control of the crucial B&O railroad, which moves troops and supplies. The two armies finally collide in Central Maryland, and a bloody week-long battle ensues along the banks of Monocacy Creek. This must be the \u201cfinal\u201d battle for both sides. In Never Call Retreat, Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen bring all of their critically acclaimed talents to bear in what is destined to become an immediate classic.",

The dog owner's terrified tot, drenched with rain, loses sight of her mother in the flurry of activity and screams, \"\"Mommy! I want Mommy!\"\" Instantly Rachel is hurled back in time to a day in her own childhood when her baby sister Michelle uttered the same cry while thunder crashed and rain poured down on them. The unearthed memory feels like a fragment from a nightmare, and Rachel doesn't understand its meaning or the anguish it stirs up in her. When she seeks answers she learns nothing from Michelle or from Judith, their loving but manipulative mother. Judith is a psychologist who is only too happy to have her adult daughters still living in her elegant Tudor house outside Washington, DC. But their apparently serene home is a house of secrets where Judith's unspoken rules forbid questions about the family history or the daughters' long-dead father. As more baffling memories surface, Rachel begins to suspect that nothing about her family is what it seems. Fighting her mother's attempts to control her, Rachel embarks on a quest that takes her deep into her own memory as well as halfway across the country. The heartbreaking truth she uncovers will shatter her world and force her to make an unthinkable choice. The Heat of the Moon is Sandra Parshall's first novel.",

        "Authors": "By Daschle, Thomas, Greenberger, Scott S. (CON), and Lambrew, Jeanne M. (CON)",
        "Description": "A much-needed and hard-hitting plan, from one of the great Democratic minds of our time, to reform America\u2019s broken health-care system. Undoubtedly, the biggest domestic policy issue in the coming years will be America\u2019s health-care system.  Millions of Americans go without medical care because they can\u2019t afford it, and many others are mired in debt because they can\u2019t pay their medical bills. It\u2019s hard to think of another public policy problem that has lingered unaddressed for so long. Why have we failed to solve a problem that is such a high priority for so many citizens?      Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle believes the problem is rooted in the complexity of the health-care issue and the power of the interest groups\u2014doctors, hospitals, insurers, drug companies, researchers, patient advocates\u2014that have a direct stake in it. Rather than simply pointing out the major flaws and placing blame, Daschle offers key solutions and creates a blueprint for solving the crisis.       Daschle\u2019s solution lies in the Federal Reserve Board, which has overseen the equally complicated financial system with great success.  A Fed-like health board would offer a public framework within which a private health-care system can operate more effectively and efficiently\u2014insulated from political pressure yet accountable to elected officials and the American people. Daschle argues that this independent board would create a single standard of care and exert tremendous influence on every other provider and payer, even those in the private sector.      After decades of failed incremental measures, the American health-care system remains fundamentally broken and requires a comprehensive fix.  With his bold and forward-looking plan, Daschle points us to the solution.",

        "Description": "Ambassador Graham gets past the political buzzwords to define what he believes to be the real issues of WMDs. These include the lack of basic information about what WMDs are and can do and how US policies influence their creation, stockpiling and use. He asserts that the US needs to re-assume leadership of efforts to reduce or eliminate WMD stockpiles and opportunities for use. He also believes recent US policies undermine international treaties that have, so far, kept down distribution of WMDs. He notes in particular the lack of support of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by the US, and how failure of the NPT will turn the lack of control of Russian nuclear material into a major disaster. Graham also believes not enough is being done to reduce the risks of WMD use or sale by volatile states such as Syria, Egypt, Iran, Israel, India, Pakistan and Libya, and that North Korea's nuclear weapons and programs are particularly dangerous. He contrasts the actions of these so-called \"rogue states\" with the assertions of the US, Britain, France, and Russia that they have the right to use nuclear weapons regardless of their signing the NPT.

        "Description": "\"The style is very clear and concise, and the treatment is authoritative throughout.\" \u2014 ChoiceRelativity remains a topic of crucial interest for scientists grappling with its implications for physics, astronomy, cosmology, and other disciplines. Laymen, too, are fascinated by relativity theory, which overturned the classical order of Newtonian physics and postulated ideas about space and time that often seem to contradict common sense.The present work is a very clear, concise, and authoritative exposition of both the special and general theories of relativity. Intended for nonscientific readers with a knowledge of high school math, the book offers illuminating coverage of such topics as the speed of light, simultaneity, time distortion of space and mass, journeys to the stars, dimension and hyperspace, the theory of general relativity, anomalies in space, and the structure and evolution of the universe.Readers with an inquisitive bent for cosmic affairs will enjoy this mind-stretching journey into the mysteries and majesty of the physical universe, where they'll share the author's explanations and speculations about why the speed of light is the speed of time, whether it may be possible to travel backward in time, how black holes are formed, how it is possible that space is curved, and much more. For anyone curious about the nature of the universe and how relativity theory continues to help scientists unlock its secrets, this accessible popular treatment is an invaluable companion and guide.",

        "Description": "Rebecca Cole--once an actress/activist and now the owner of the trend-setting Greenwich Village store Potted Gardens--introduces a whole new way to garden. Using any container--from the bed of a toy truck to a bedpan--and any kind of plant--from rose to weed--would-be gardeners can follow Rebecca's guidance and plant a bit of beauty in a corner of their homes or gardens.Starting at the beginning--what a garden means to urban dwellers and their country cousins and how to stimulate your own imagination--she then helps us hunt for plants at neighborhood nurseries and markets (which she advocates over catalogue shopping); gather containers from dumps, attics, flea markets, and antiques stores; and put it all together in potted gardens for windowsill, desk, and patio. In a chapter on terraces, she turns to the great outdoors, explaining the design and creation of complete gardens made up of\u00a0\u00a0containers, artfully arranged to make the most of small spaces. And all along the way she shares her own experiences with breaking all the rules to achieve ebullient flowering displays.With nearly 200 spectacular photographs, illustrated step-by-step instructions on how to plant in wooden boxes, metal containers, and how to plant bulbs; tips on maintaining a finished potted garden; suggestions on further reading; and a glossary--Potted Gardens is the everyday companion for the new and experienced container gardener alike.Rebecca Cole is the proprietor of one of New York City's most talked-about shops, Potted Gardens, where she mixes well-loved antiques (and old sinks and watering cans) with flowers and plants. She has made appearances on \"Our Home\" and \"Home Matters\" and is a regular guest on \"Fox After Breakfast.\" Her work has been featured in Architectural Digest, Travel and Leisure, House Beautiful, the New York Times, and Victoria, among others. She lives in New York City.Richard Felber has been photographing America's gardens for two decades. Among the many magazines that have published his work are House Beautiful, Garden Design, and New York magazine. This is his first book. He lives in Connecticut.Grab a pot, a wooden box, or a tin can; gather your bulbs and flowers; and read Rebecca Cole's Potted Gardens for a whole new way to look at gardening.",

Everybody forgets things sometimes -- from your keys to your lunch date to the name of an acquaintance. According to Dr. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA Center on Aging, much of this forgetfulness can be eliminated easily through his innovative memory exercises and brain fitness program -- now available for the first time in a book. Using Small's recent scientific discoveries, The Memory Bible can immediately improve your mental performance. One of the ten commandments that Dr. Small has pioneered to improve your memory immediately is LOOK, SNAP, CONNECT: 1: LOOK: actively observe what you want to learn2: SNAP: create a vivid snapshot and memorable image3: CONNECT: visualize a link to associate images In addition, Dr. Small's comprehensive program includes a \"brain diet\" of memory-enhancing foods and a list of the most effective drugs, as well as a workbook with a weekly and daily calendar. Remember, as Dr. Small says, \"Great memories are not born, they are made.\"",

Kay argues that although NATO has evolved to some degree, it remains an institution dependent upon the United States with uncertain long-term prospects for playing a constructive role in Europe. Indeed, the author shows that if not implemented carefully, NATO enlargement may actually decrease rather than increase stability in the region.",

        "Description": "Europe 1992, the market integration of the twelve European Community (EC) member states, has attracted widespread attention as an economic project of enormous importance. But though journalists and scholars have focused much attention on the economic aspects of Europe 1992, the program's impact on the governance of the EC has been largely ignored\u2014even though the creation of a single market is intimately linked to changes in governance.With each member state having a very different institutional structure, the variation within the EC is far greater than that found in federations such as the United States. Though this variety adds to the complexity of consensus building among the members, it allows effective representation of diverse national interests and needs, thus making the EC a very strong, competitive force. To negotiate effectively with this \"new\" Community, international policymakers will need a greater understanding of how the EC will operate in the wake of the Maastricht Summit.Euro-Politics examines various aspects of the institutional dynamics of the EC and offers important insight into policy making within the Community. David Cameron discusses the origin of the 1992 program and examines the role of the nation-state in the Community. Guy Peters surveys the \"political\" and executive institutions, while Martin Shapiro discusses the European Court of Justice and the evolution of judicial review within the Community. John Woolley examines the European Monetary System and the movement  toward the \"EuroFed,\" Gary Marks studies the importance of the Regional Funds for both the EC and selected member states, and Peter Lange discusses the Social Charter and its implications for  both employers and unions. Alberta Sbragia concludes with an analysis of institutional dynamics and policymaking with the Community in light of the new questions they raise for traditional notions of governance.",

        "Description": "Amid all of the criticisms of America's war in Iraq, one essential voice has remained silent\u2014until now. In his groundbreaking new memoir, Wiser in Battle, Lieutenant General Ricardo S. Sanchez, former commander of coalition forces in Iraq, reports back from the front lines of the global war on terror to provide a comprehensive and chilling exploration of America's historic military and foreign policy blunder.With unflinching candor, Sanchez describes the chaos on the Iraqi battlefield caused by the Bush administration's misguided command of the military, as well as his own struggle to set the coalition on the path toward victory. Sanchez illuminates the fallout of the communication breakdown between the leadership on the front and the politicians in Washington, revealing fractious discussions he had with, among others, Ambassador Paul Bremer and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.Drawing on his tenure on the ground, Sanchez shows how minor insurgent attacks grew into synchronized operations that finally ignited into a major insurgency and all-out civil war. He provides an insider's account of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, explaining the circumstances that led to the abuses, who perpetrated them, and what the formal investigations revealed\u2014all the while reflecting on America's objectionable use of torture and the grave need for the country's leadership to pursue an ethical course of action in the war on terror. Sanchez also details the cynical use of the Iraq War for political gain in Washington and shows how the pressure of an around-the-clock news cycle drove and distorted critical battle decisions, such as troop drawdowns, the fight for Fallujah, and the transfer of sovereignty.In addition, Sanchez shares the story of his career. He tells of the journey from his poverty-stricken youth on the Texas banks of the Rio Grande to joining the Reserve Officers' Training Corps at sixteen and later serving in Kosovo, Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and, ultimately, Iraq. At the time of his retirement, Sanchez was the highest-ranking Hispanic in the U.S. Army.The first book written by a former on-site commander in Iraq, Wiser in Battle is essential reading for all who wish to understand the current war and the American military's role in the new century.",

Was it a misdial or an aborted crime report?Brynn stumbles onto a scene of true horror and narrowly escapes from two professional criminals. She and a terrified visitor to the weekend house, Michelle, flee into the woods in a race for their lives. As different as night and day, and stripped of modern-day resources, Brynn, a tough deputy with a difficult past, and Michelle, a pampered city girl, must overcome their natural reluctance to trust each other and learn to use their wits and courage to survive the relentless pursuit. The deputy's disappearance spurs both her troubled son and her new husband into action, while the incident sets in motion Brynn's loyal fellow deputies and elements from Milwaukee's underside. These various forces race along inexorably toward the novel's gritty and stunning conclusion.The Bodies Left Behind is an epic cat-and-mouse chase, told nearly in real-time, and is filled with Deaver's patented twists and turns, where nothing is what it seems, and death lingers just around the next curve on a deserted path deep in the midnight forest.",

        "Description": "When you're in your late twenties and nothing in your life seems to be falling into place, knitting is an awfully seductive way to spend your free time. After all, as long as you're following the instructions, you can knit row after row with the knowledge that the pattern will emerge and you'll end up with just what you wanted.  Life, on the other hand, doesn't come with a stitch counter, so Kathleen, Sari, and Lucy, the heroines of KNITTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE, just have to figure things out as they go along.  Their weekly Sunday knitting circle is the only thing holding them together as Kathleen is cut off financially by her family and forced to enter `the real world' for the very first time at the age of twenty-seven, Sari finds herself falling for the man who made her life a living hell in high school but who now desperately needs her help, and Lucy finds herself torn between emotion and reason when her lab and her boyfriend are assailed by an animal-rights group.At their club meetings, they discuss the really important questions: how bad is it, really, to marry for money if you like the guy a lot anyway? Can you ever forgive someone for something truly atrocious that they've done? Is it better to be unhappily coupled than happily alone? And the little ones: Can you wear a bra with a hand-knit tube top? Is it ever acceptable to knit something for a boyfriend? And why do your stitches become lopsided after your second martini?In Claire LaZebnik's hilarious and sometimes heartbreaking novel, Sari, Lucy, and Kathleen's lives intersect, overlap, unravel, and come back together-the result is an utterly satisfying read.",
