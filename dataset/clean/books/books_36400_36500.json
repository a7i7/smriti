They'd eloped to Gretna Green in a fiery passion, but passion can sometimes burn too hot to last.But now, Rees makes her a brazen offer, and Helene decides to become his wife again...but not in name only. No, this time she decides to be very, very wicked indeed.",

With The Forbidden Zone, he continues his journey beyond the cutting edge of terrifying suspense into the sphere of a relentless psychological thriller only he could have written.Every small town has a special place like the mound. Lovers go there to woo, families picnic in summer, children sled in winter. For the community of Oscola, New York, the mound has never been dangerous...until now.Now something beyond cunning or imagining, something that appears undeniably evil is hiding beneath the mound. The terror comes from out of time, space, and the depths of the human mind with its alien needs and desires. It spreads its roots in secret...changing, transforming, reshaping reality. It seeks to sweep aside all that the good townfolk love and cherish: their past, their hopes, the promise of their souls. It fills the innocent earth with its presence - it screams with power.How can ordinary people protect themselves from this evil? How can they fight its weapon of soulbreaking potency - a sweetly seductive yet unspeakably savage pleasure too intense to resist? Brian Kelly, a courageous physicist still grieving over the hideous death of his first wife and child, suspects that the shell of reality must have been torn to let in this monstrosity. He must discover a way to repair the rift. His very pregnant second wife, Loi, a beautiful and brilliant refugee from the pain of Vietnam, has battled demons before. She's ready to dare anything to save her unborn son.The tough yet dangerously vulnerable Ellen Maas, a big-city reporter trying to revive the local paper, must finally commit to destroying the beast - or perish herself. Bob West, a cop who saw every kind of madness and violence during the war, will return to the law of the jungle - or worse - if it will save his family.They must band together to unmask and defeat the invincible evil beneath the mound. But even in their most private imaginings they cannot conceive of the power they will confront and the vengeance it can wreak on any who oppose its design of conquest. Only an impossible gamble will give the town of Oscola a chance to prevail, and only Brian and Loi know the stakes.",

Now at last, the internationally famous pediatrician, in collaboration with an eminent child psychiatrist, has brought his unique insights to the preschool and first-grade years. In his warm, funny, empathic tone, he again listens to the child's perspective while also showing his characteristic compassion for the parents' feelings.Parents will welcome the unique features of this important new guide.

On a cold March night New York Times  reporter John Schuyler Moore is summoned to the East River by his friend and former Harvard classmate Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a psychologist, or \"alienist.\" On the unfinished Williamsburg Bridge, they view the horribly mutilated body of an adolescent boy, a prostitute from one of Manhattan's infamous brothels.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The newly appointed police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt, in a highly unorthodox move, enlists the two men in the murder investigation, counting on the reserved Kreizler's intellect and Moore's knowledge of New York's vast criminal underworld. They are joined by Sara Howard, a brave and determined woman who works as a secretary in the police department. Laboring in secret (for alienists, and the emerging discipline of psychology, are viewed by the public with skepticism at best), the unlikely team embarks on what is a revolutionary effort in criminology-- amassing a psychological profile of the man they're looking for based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who has killed before. and will kill again before the hunt is over.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fast-paced and gripping, infused with a historian's exactitude, The Alienist  conjures up the Gilded Age and its untarnished underside: verminous tenements and opulent mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills. Here is a New York during an age when questioning society's belief that all killers are born, not made, could have unexpected and mortal consequences.",

        "Authors": "By Kinnane, Adrian",
        "Description": "In 1802 E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company sprouted, like an acorn, close to the young oak of American life. In the early years DuPont explosives helped the new nation build canals and railroads, ports and harbors, and dams and mines. DuPont munitions also served national needs during time of war.The company's diversification into plastics, dyes, and synthetic materials after 1900 matched new technologies to the needs of a complex, maturing society. DuPont's pioneering research yielded a host of new products like neoprene and nylon, and its service in the Manhattan Project in World War II helped bring that prolonged conflict to a decisive end. The post-war years brought sharp competition and high-stakes global challenges. DuPont restructured its business and research efforts, mining science for useful discoveries in diverse fields like energy, health, electronics, specialty fibers, and biotechnology. Its international impact, reputation, and market reach grew as well. And when science helped galvanize the environmental movement, DuPont led industries worldwide to a renewed sense of stewardship for the earth's resources.Today DuPont operates in more than 70 countries throughout the world, and its vision and impact are global. But it has held to a core of enduring values, a deep taproot drawing on the past to sustain the present and nurture the future. Harnessing fundamental discoveries in science to create value in world markets, DuPont people have transformed their company successfully for two centuries, making DuPont one of the most successful and sustained industrial enterprises in the world. Their story makes for exciting history, and this book tells how they did it.",
