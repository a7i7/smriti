But that\u2019s easier said than done. Statistically, half of all employment decisions result in a mishire: The wrong person winds up in the wrong job. But companies that have followed Bradford Smart\u2019s advice in Topgrading have boosted their successful hiring rate to 90 percent or better, giving them an unbeatable competitive advantage.Now Smart has fully revised his 1999 management classic to reintroduce the topgrading concept, which works for companies large and small in any industry. The author spells out his practical approach to finding and managing A-level talent\u2014as well as coaching B players to turn them into A players. He provides intriguing case studies drawn from more than four thousand in-depth interviews.As Smart writes in his introduction, \u201cAll organizations, all businesses live or die mostly on their talent, and any manager who fails to topgrade is nuts, or a C player. . . . Those who, way deep down, would sooner see an organization die than nudge an incompetent person out of a job should not read this book... Topgrading is for A players and all those aspiring to be A players.\u201dOn the web: http://www.topgrading.com/",

        "Authors": "By Loflin, Jones and Musig, Todd",
        "Description": "What do you do when your life feels as busy as a three-ring circus?  Juggling Elephants tells a simple but profound story about one man with a universal problem. Mark has too much to do, too many priorities, too much stress, and too little time.  As he struggles to balance his many responsibilities without cracking under the pressure, Mark takes a break to attend the circus with his family.  There he has a surprising conversation with a wise ringmaster. He leaves with a simple but powerful lesson: Trying to get everything done is like juggling elephants -- impossible.  So Mark begins to think about his work, family, and personal life the way a ringmaster thinks about the many acts in a three-ring circus. He discovers that managing his various acts can be fun and easy once he changes his attitude and follows his new friend's ongoing guidance. Mark soon realizes: \u00a0\u2022\u00a0If you keep trying to juggle elephants, no one, including you, will be thrilled with your performance.\u00a0\u2022\u00a0A ringmaster cannot be in all three rings at once.\u00a0\u2022\u00a0The key to the success of a circus is having quality acts in all three rings.\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Intermission is an essential part of any good circus.  Juggling Elephants is a wonderfully lighthearted guide for everyone who feels like they're about to be squashed. It will help you better focus your time and energy, so you'll be able to enjoy more of the things that are important to you. Above all, it will teach you how to run your circus, instead of letting the circus run you.",

Each finds this intimate and exhilarating, as they are able to reveal things that would never be spoken aloud. Yet as the months pass, their letters depict two very distinct views of their time apart and of their marriage. As the separation begins to unravel the threads that bind their marriage together, we bear witness to the evolution and eventually the breakdown of communication. For their \"season of celibacy,\" as they originally joked, is proving to be more of a challenge than either had ever imagined, one that tests the strength of their marriage and their commitment to one another.",

Imagine averting a tantrum because your baby was able to communicate her desire for a favorite toy without tears, or simply sharing in your baby's wonderment at the sight of a bird on a tree-before he has even uttered his first word! Generally, children do not develop the motor skills necessary to speak until they are two, and yet they are able to communicate using sign language as early as six months. Written by an experienced signer and a mother of three, this illustrated step-by-step guide will allow readers to join the ranks of parents around the world who experience the rich rewards of communicating with their preverbal babies by using sign language.  Studies have shown that babies who are taught to use signs to express themselves before they can actually speak are more contented because they can communicate their basic needs (and ideas!) and also are more skilled at speaking once they begin to acquire language. Full of practical tips, real anecdotes, and straightforward diagrams of more than sixty basic American Sign Language signs, Baby Talk is the essential baby-signing handbook for parents, relatives, and caregivers-and their babies, who are just a little too young to express themselves verbally.",

        "Description": "No one conducts a more chilling, suspenseful, thoroughly engrossing tour through the winding corridors of criminal behavior and the secret chambers of psychopathology than Jonathan Kellerman, the bestselling \u201cmaster of the psychological thriller\u201d (People). Now the incomparable team of psychologist Alex Delaware and homicide cop Milo Sturgis embark on their most dangerous excursion yet, into the dark places where risk runs high and blood runs cold.It\u2019s a story tailor-made for the nightly news: Dylan Meserve and Michaela Brand, young lovers and fellow acting students, vanish on the way home from a rehearsal. Three days later, the two of them are found in the remote mountains of Malibu -battered and terrified after a harrowing ordeal at the hands of a sadistic abductor. The details of the nightmarish event are shocking and brutal: The couple was carjacked at gunpoint by a masked assailant and subjected to a horrific regimen of confinement, starvation and assault.  But before long, doubts arise about the couple\u2019s story, and as forensic details unfold, the abduction is exposed as a hoax. Charged as criminals themselves, the aspiring actors claim emotional problems, and the court orders psychological evaluation for both. Michaela is examined by Alex Delaware, who finds that her claims of depression and stress ring true enough. But they don\u2019t explain her lies, and Alex is certain that there are hidden layers in this sordid psychodrama that even he hasn\u2019t been able to penetrate.Nevertheless, the case is closed\u2013only to be violently reopened when Michaela is savagely murdered. When the police look for Dylan, they find that he\u2019s gone. Is he the killer or a victim himself? Casting their dragnet into the murkiest corners of L.A., Delaware and Sturgis unearth more questions than answers\u2013including a host of eerily identical killings. What really happened to the couple who cried wolf? And what bizarre and brutal epidemic is infecting the city with terror, madness, and sudden, twisted death?",
