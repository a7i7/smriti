        "Description": "First published in 1855, Bulfinch's Mythology has introduced generations of readers to the great myths of Greece and Rome, as well as time-honored legends of Norse mythology, medieval, and chivalric tales, Oriental fables, and more. Readers have long admired Bulfinch's versions for the skill with which he wove various versions of a tale into a coherent whole, the vigor of his storytelling, and his abundant cross-references to poetry and painting, demonstrating the relationship of literature and art. Now The Age of Fable, the first section of the Mythology, is available in this inexpensive, highly readable edition. Drawing on the works of Homer, Ovid, Virgil, and other classical authors, as well as an immense trove of stories about the Norse gods and heroes, The Age of Fable offers lively retellings of the myths of the Greek and Roman gods: Venus and Adonis, Jupiter and Juno, Daphne and Apollo, and many others.The myths and legends so vividly retold in this volume underlie much of the art, literature, and culture of Western civilization. As Bulfinch put it, \"Without a knowledge of mythology, much of the elegant literature of our own language cannot be understood and appreciated.\" With this inexpensive edition of The Age of Fable, readers can immerse themselves in these seminal myths, increasing their appreciation and understanding of Western culture, while enjoying the myths purely as the great stories they are.",

Sample urges leaders and aspiring leaders to focus on some key counterintuitive truths. He offers his own down-to-earth, homespun, and often provocative advice on some complex and thoughtful issues. And he provides many practical, if controversial, tactics for successful leadership, suggesting, among other things, that leaders should sometimes compromise their principles, not read everything that comes across their desks, and always put off decisions.",

There's little as thrilling as firefighting-at least to Rowan Tripp. The Missoula smoke jumpers are in Rowan's blood: her father is a legend. She's been fighting fires since her eighteenth birthday. At this point, returning to the wilds of Montana for the season feels like coming home-even with reminders of the partner she lost last season still lingering. Fortunately, this year's rookie crop is one of the strongest ever-and Gulliver Curry's one of the best. He's also a walking contradiction, a hotshot firefighter with a big vocabulary and a winter job at a kids' arcade. Everything is thrown off balance when a dark presence lashes out against Rowan, looking to blame someone for last year's tragedy. Rowan knows she can't complicate things with Gull-any distractions in the air or on the ground could mean the end-but if she doesn't find someone she can lean on, she may not make it through the summer. . . .",

At the time of his death, Oliver was working on a new book about Mozart. Though the official report states that Oliver died in a tragic accident, the facts don\u2019t add up. But as Ben and Leigh dig deeper, they find that Oliver\u2019s research reveals that Mozart, a notable Freemason, may have been killed by a shadowy and powerful splinter group of the organization. The only proof lies in a missing letter, believed to have been written by Mozart himself. When Leigh and Ben receive a video documenting a ritual sacrifice performed by hooded men, they realize that the sect is still in existence today and will stop at nothing to keep its secrets. From the dreaming spires of Oxford and Venice\u2019s labyrinthine canals to the majes\u00adtic architecture of Vienna, Ben and Leigh must race across Europe to uncover the truth behind the Mozart conspiracy before they become its next victims. In the tradition of Robert Ludlum and Dan Brown, Scott Mariani\u2019s The Mozart Conspiracy is an electrify\u00ading thriller and the start of an exciting new series.",

        "Description": "In 2003, after winning six of the twelve majors from 2000 to 2002, Tiger Woods struggled with his swing, leaving him lagging behind the field at both the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship. With Woods out of the picture, the stage was set for a newcomer to claim the top position. Nobody expected that four virtual unknowns would become first-time champions. In his debut in a major, Ben Curtis became the only player since 1913 to prevail on his first time out. Mike Weir--considered good but not great--triumphed in the Masters, becoming the first Canadian to win a major. In the U.S. Open, Jim Furyk was victorious, and the PGA Championship was claimed by the unknown Shawn Micheel. Here, John Feinstein returns to that unlikely year to chronicle the struggles of these four players, giving readers an insider's look into how winning (and losing) major championships changes players' lives.--From publisher description.",

And especially to a young Israeli couple devastated by their own, very personal loss and unable to reach out to each other in their private pain.After centuries of war and decades of crime, the prospect of international harmony is tantalizing the tiny nation of Israel. After millennia of waiting, the prospect of a rebuilt Temple on Jerusalem's holy mount seems a miraculous gift. And to Israeli Major Isaac Ben-David, disillusioned by loss and hungry for meaning, the opportunity to work for peace is all but irresistible.Isaac's opportunity lies with Adrian Romulus, the president of the European Union Council of Ministers. He's a charismatic, visionary world leader with a workable plan for solving the world's problems. Tall, handsome, and deeply spiritual, he is also personally interested in the nation of Israel. Everyone agrees he's a man who can bring peace to a troubled world.But why do thoughts of Romulus trouble Isaac's wife, Sarah, an Israeli security officer? How can Romulus know Isaac and Sarah's most private secrets? And why is he so obsessed with an ancient spearhead in an Austrian museum?Just who is Adrian Romulus, anyway? And what are his plans for Isaac Ben-David-and the world?",

        "Title": "Jihad Incorporated: A Guide to Militant Islam in the Us",
        "Authors": "By Emerson, Steven",
        "Description": "What is the structure of al Qaeda and radical Islamic activity in the United States today? How has it evolved since 9/11? To what extent does domestic radical Islamism pose a threat to US national security at home and abroad? The Investigative Project on Terrorism, founded in 1995 by Steven Emerson, maintains the largest nongovernmental data and intelligence library in the world on militant Islam. The Project assists the White House, the FBI, the Justice Department, Department of Homeland Security, and other government departments with counterterrorism activities. Together with a staff of experts, Executive Director Steven Emerson has compiled this thorough factual overview of the Islamist terrorist threat to the United States. Unlike The 9/11 Commission Report, which was focused mainly on the retrospective analysis of al Qaeda activities leading up to the attack of September 11, 2001, Jihad Incorporated provides an in-depth examination of radical terrorist organizations and their financial support networks operating in the United States and abroad. Divided into three sections, the work first sets the stage for the current situation by reviewing the lessons learned from previous terrorist plots and attacks both within our borders and against American interests abroad. Emerson and colleagues profile key players in the terrorist network and describe their various criminal activities before and since 9/11. The second section analyzes organizations in the Middle East besides al Qaeda that have established ties in the United States: Hamas, Hizballah, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and radical groups in Pakistan. The third section analyzes the subtle, wide-ranging support system for terrorist activities that exists within our own borders: charities and foundations that secretly solicit for terror; the complex corporate web of companies, charities, and nonprofit corporations known as the SAAR Network; mosques that provide cover for terrorists; the use of the Internet for terrorist communication; and lobbying efforts by Muslim American organizations to influence the top echelons of the federal government. In a dangerous age, this is an important book for all Americans to read.",
