They include works by artists ranging from Durer and Brueghel to Rousseau and Klee, pottery and sculpture from ancient Greece, Oriental scrolls and wall paintings, and are accompanied by quotations from Plato and Shakespeare to Wordsworth and Walt Whitman.In making her choice, Sylvia Judson's intention was \"to communicate a sense of affirmation, of wonder, of trust. This is a spirit alien to much of the art of our insecure time, but one which I am confident will some day return.\"The Quiet Eye was first published as a large format art book in 1954, when it won immediate acclaim. The 1982 edition features a more convenient size and some color images that were originally published in black and white.",

        "Description": "An unorthodox, yet highly effective approach to team learning.Part novel, part workbook, Light Bulbs for Leaders is brimming with insights, ideas, tools, and step-by-step guidelines all packaged in a down-to-earth, easy-to digest form.Book I, \"A Tale of Teamwork and Continuous Learning,\" tells the fictional story of Fulcrum Corporation and its efforts to regain the considerable ground it has lost in recent years. Faced with rapidly shrinking budgets and mounting competition, CEO Gary Anderson concludes that radical culture change is Fulcrum's only hope for survival.He appoints a learning team of six senior managers, Janice, Ted, Pat, Andy, Lois, and John, to thrash out the details of just how this can be accomplished. As the story unfolds, you follow the team's adventures as they attempt to fulfill their mission and to transform Fulcrum from a fractious collection of brilliant high-tech cowboys into a learning organization of team players. You experience their setbacks and successes as they attempt to surmount the psychological and procedural obstacles every team must overcome before achieving its goals. And you follow them as they take what they've learned back to their own groups to successfully lead the team learning process. Along the way, you gain valuable insights into the human subtleties of team learning and acquire practical lessons that you can apply in your own team-building efforts.Book II, \"The Light Bulbs,\" lists the 88 epiphanies--moments in the story when the team \"got it\"--that are crucial to creating a high-performing team.Book III, \"A Guide to Team Learning,\" helps you make effective use of the lessons learned in Books I and II. Packed with checklists, exercises, charts, and other visual aids, this handbook helps you master the skills you need to overcome impasses in the team learning process and to achieve ever higher levels of team performance and productivity.An enlightening and entertaining read and a valuable blueprint for transforming any organization into a learning organization, Light Bulbs for Leaders is a must-have management and training resource.\"There cannot be a successful organization in America today that doesn't depend upon teamwork for superior performance and growth. During a time when rapidly shifting societal and economic changes are scrambling conventional notions about personal interactions, Light Bulbs for Leaders is the perfect descrambler. Its technical approach is the right mix of creativity, boldness, and scar tissue, all presented in an arrestingly readable package.\"--Norman R.

        "Description": "In the summer of 1990, the first nearly complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton ever found was excavated in the Montana badlands under the supervision of one of the world's leading dinosaur paleontologists, Dr. John Horner.That same year a second, even more complete, skeleton was found in South Dakota. Together these skeletons are yielding surprising new insights into the most famous of the dinosaurs. We know more today than ever before about the anatomy and behavior of T. rex, and about the world in which it lived.Among the surprising discoveries explained in this book are T. rex was a far sleeker carnivore than previously thought, perhaps weighing less than 6 1/2 tons, no more than a bull elephant; T. rex's principal habitat was forest, not swamp or plain; T. rex may have been warm blooded, and it may be that its body temperature cooled as it matured; T. rex's arms were shorter than previously thought, but even more powerful; and there appear to have been two forms of T. rex, perhaps male and female.The Complete T. rex is beautifully illustrated with reproductions of paintings by leading dinosaur artists, and photographs, including Dr. Horner's excavation and restoration of a T. rex skeleton.Written by a celebrated dinosaur scientist, this is the most complete and important account ever of the life and times of the king of dinosaurs.",

        "Description": "Folksy and fresh, endearing and affecting, Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe is the now-classic novel of two women in the 1980s; of gray-headed Mrs. Threadgoode telling her life story to Evelyn, who is in the sad slump of middle age. The tale she tells is also of two women--of the irrepressibly daredevilish tomboy Idgie and her friend Ruth--who back in the thirties ran a little place in Whistle Stop, Alabama, a Southern kind of Cafe Wobegon offering good barbecue and good coffee and all kinds of love and laughter, even an occasional murder. And as the past unfolds, the present--for Evelyn and for us--will never be quite the same again... \"Airplanes and television have removed the Threadgoodes from the Southern scene. Happily for us, Fannie Flagg has preserved a whole community of them in a richly comic, poignant narrative that records the exuberance of their lives, the sadness of their departure. Idgie Threadgoode is a true original: Huckleberry Finn would have tried to marry her!\" --Harper Lee, Author of To Kill a Mockingbird \"A real novel and a good one... [from] the busy brain of a born storyteller.\" --The New York Times \"It's very good, in fact, just wonderful.\" --Los Angeles Times \"Funny and macabre.\" --The Washington Post \"Courageous and wise.\" --Houston Chronicle",

Publicly declared a bastard at the age of three, daughter of a disgraced and executed   mother, last in the line of succession to the throne of England, Elizabeth I inherited   an England ravaged by bloody religious conflict, at war with Spain and France, and   badly in debt. When she died in 1603, after a forty-five year reign, her empire   spanned two continents and was united under one church, victorious in war, and blessed   with an overflowing treasury. What\u2019s more, her favorites\u2014William Shakespeare, Sir   Francis Drake, and Sir Walter Raleigh\u2014had made  the Elizabethan era a cultural Golden   Age still remembered today. But for Elizabeth the woman, tragedy went hand in hand   with triumph. Politics and scandal forced the passionate queen to reject her true   love, Robert Dudley, and to execute his stepson, her much-adored Lord Essex. Now   in this spellbinding novel, Rosalind Miles brings to life the woman behind the myth.   By turns imperious, brilliant, calculating, vain, and witty, this is the Elizabeth   the world never knew.  From the days of her brutal father, Henry VIII, to her final   dying moments, Elizabeth tells her story in her own words.",

All too soon he finds himself in the vortex of a plot that includes seduction, secret political documents, and more than one murder. Rich in historical detail of a decaying world that agonizes-as does fencing itself-over the ideals of honor and chivalry, The Fencing Master is superb literature and a true page-turner.",

        "Title": "Flesh in the Age of Reason: The Modern Foundations of Body and Soul",
        "Authors": "By Porter, Roy",
        "Description": "Starting with the grim Britain of the Civil War era, with its punishing sense of the body as a corrupt vessel for the soul, Roy Porter charts how, through figures as diverse as Locke, Swift, Johnson, and Gibbon, ideas about medicine, politics, and religion fundamentally changed notions of self. He shows how the Enlightenment (with its explosion or rational thinking and scientific invention of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries) provided a lens through which we can best see the profound shift from the theocentric, otherwordly, Dark Ages to the modern, earthly, body-centered world we live in today. As man made in God's image gave way to the Enlightenment's notion of the Self-made man, the body moved center stage. Porter writes brilliantly on the ways in which men and women flaunted, decorated, tanned, and dieted themselves: activities that we find familiar but that a Puritan divine would have considered satanic. And he explores how, at the end of the century, the human soul took on a new significance in the works of Godwin, Blake, and Byron.",

        "Title": "Juicing the Game: Drugs, Power, and the Fight for the Soul of Major League Baseball",
        "Authors": "By Bryant, Howard",
        "Description": "It has come to be known as \"the Juiced Era.\" In the decade that followed the 1994 players' strike, Major League Baseball rode the greatest offensive explosion of the twentieth century to reap unprecedented profits and become more popular than it had been in decades. It was a miraculous comeback for a sport that appeared to have incurred irreversible damage from the 232-day strike that forced the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in ninety years. Commissioner Bud Selig proudly declared it a renaissance.But there was a dark side to Selig's renaissance, a black cloud that would soon cast a shadow over the entire sport, calling into question some of the game's greatest accomplishments and casting several of the era's greatest players as cheaters and liars.Juicing the Game, the first complete history of the Juiced Era exposes baseball's crippling lack of leadership and pursuit of profit at the expense of the integrity of the game and its record book. Drawing from interviews with all of the era's major figures - including Commissioners Bud Selig and Fay Vincent, Players Association heads Donald Fehr and Marvin Miller, baseball executives Sandy Alderson and Rob Manfred, team executives Billy Beane and Brian Cashman, and players ranging from Reggie Jackson to Tony Gwynn to Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield - as well as original research by Bill James, it combines hard-hitting investigative journalism with a dramatic narrative that leaves no stone unturned, from Jose Canseco's controversial career and Brady Anderson's fluke 1996 season to the BALCO investigation and the congressional hearings in the spring of 2005. It is a captivating history of a tainted era that has in turn tainted the game forever.",
