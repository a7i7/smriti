Included here are many easy-to-follow recipes for baked goods (which are usually laden with dairy products) for the lactose intolerant or milk-allergic sufferer who must either learn to bake milk-free or go without cakes, cookies, pies, muffins, biscuits, and puddings. The appendix also lists recipes for baked goods that are egg-free.\"Most people who deal with food intolerances day in and day out become pretty good 'scratch' cooks. I wrote this book as an all-occasion cookbook. The idea is to give you lots of choices. The Milk-Free Kitchen is focused on all the things you can have. The idea behind every recipe here is that the food should taste good. I hope you will enjoy your milk-free meals and that you and the people with whom you share them will not feel deprived or 'different'\"\u2014Beth Kidder",

Along the way, they explain how to build a coalition when it is needed to implement the program efficiently.

Rather than embracing a merely reactive approach to human error, Marx argues for holding people accountable based on the quality of their choices\u2014not merely the positive or negative outcomes in any given situation. On a macro level, this would include retiring the medical malpractice system, re-evaluating tort reform objectives and incorporating error-reporting systems into healthcare and aviation sectors. On a micro level, Marx encourages readers to release their expectations of perfection and embrace personal accountability for choices they and their neighbors make daily.",

Every year on the first Monday of December, Marnie and her twelve closest girlfriends gather in the evening with batches of beautifully wrapped homemade cookies. Everyone has to bring a dish, a bottle of wine, and their stories. This year, the stories are especially important. Marnie's oldest daughter has a risky pregnancy. Will she find out tonight how that story might end? Jeannie's father is having an affair with her best friend. Who else knew about the betrayal, and how can that be forgiven or forgotten, even among old friends such as these? Rosie's husband doesn't want children, and she has to decide, very soon, whether or not that's a deal breaker for the marriage. Taylor's life is in financial freefall. Each woman, each friend has a story to tell, and they are all interwoven, just as their lives are.On this evening, at least, they can feel as a group the impulses of sisterly love and conflict, the passion and hopefulness of a new romance, the betrayal and disillusionment some relationships bring, the joys and fears of motherhood, the agony of losing a child, and above all, the love they have for one another. As Marnie says, the Christmas Cookie Club, if it's anything, is a reminder of delight.The Christmas Cookie Club is about the paths Marnie and her friends have traveled, the absolute joy they take in life and love despite the decisions they've regretted, the hard choices and amends they've had to make, and the sacrifices along the way. Ultimately, The Christmas Cookie Club is every woman's story. As you read about Marnie and her friends, their struggles and triumphs, what makes them laugh and what has made them cry, you'll see yourself and some of the ingredients of your own story. Celebrating courage and joy in spite of hard times and honoring the importance of women's friendships as well as the embracing bonds of community, Ann Pearlman has written a novel that speaks to us all.",

Drawing on previously untapped sources and building on original research from coauthor Joshua Rosner\u2014who himself raised early warnings with the public and investors, and kept detailed records\u2014Morgenson connects the dots that led to this fiasco. Morgenson and Rosner draw back the curtain on Fannie Mae, the mortgage-finance giant that grew, with the support of the Clinton administration, through the 1990s, becoming a major opponent of government oversight even as it was benefiting from public subsidies. They expose the role played not only by Fannie Mae executives but also by enablers at Countrywide Financial, Goldman Sachs, the Federal Reserve, HUD, Congress, the FDIC, and the biggest players on Wall Street, to show how greed, aggression, and fear led countless officials to ignore warning signs of an imminent disaster.

        "Description": "Would You Rather...? takes the idea of parlor game questions to a new level of debate and lunacy. It&#39;s a chunky book of 400 questions that range from the heinous to the nauseating to the downright disturbing, each a field-tested conversation starter\u2014because no matter how strange or far-fetched, Would You Rather...? knows that choice provokes thinking, and thinking is fun. Some questions, like a Rorschach test, reveal values: Would you rather . . . Age only from the neck up -OR- age only from the neck down? Be stupid and rich -OR- smart and poor? Some delight in their own grossness: Eat three earthworms -OR- wear a necklace made of them on your wedding day? Be trapped in an elevator with wet dogs -OR- three fat men with bad breath? Some churn up prejudices: Lose your mate to the same sex as yourself -OR- the opposite sex? Some create that squirming sensation: Get a bad case of poison ivy way up inside your nose -OR- inside your inner ear? Or ethical dilemmas: Be president of a firm that poaches endangered species -OR- work for a corrupt politician? And some are just deliciously absurd: Catch a porcupine thrown from a second-story window -OR- a skunk thrown from the same window? Each question is followed up with related, often off-the-wall information, from odd trivia to dumb jokes to the occasional practical advice (go for the skunk\u2014the porcupine&#39;s got 30,000 quills, while tomato juice will take away the skunk smell).",

Now, in The Wrecking Crew, Frank examines the blundering and corrupt Washington those politicians have given us. Casting back to the early days of the conservative revolution, Frank describes the rise of a ruling coalition dedicated to dismantling government. But rather than cutting down the big government they claim to hate, conservatives have simply sold it off, deregulating some industries, defunding others, but always turning public policy into a private-sector bidding war. Washington itself has been remade into a golden landscape of super-wealthy suburbs and gleaming lobbyist headquarters\u2014the wages of government-by-entrepreneurship practiced so outrageously by figures such as Jack Abramoff.It is no coincidence, Frank argues, that the same politicians who guffaw at the idea of effective government have installed a regime in which incompetence is the rule. Nor will the country easily shake off the consequences of deliberate misgovernment through the usual election remedies. Obsessed with achieving a lasting victory, conservatives have taken pains to enshrine the free market as the permanent creed of state.Stamped with Thomas Frank\u2019s audacity, analytic brilliance, and wit, The Wrecking Crew is his most revelatory work yet\u2014and his most important.",

It's been four years since Tara stole Amy's fianc\u00e9---four years since Amy swore she'd stop playing second fiddle to spotlight-hog Tara. Amy thought she had finally made peace with herself, but when Tara asks whether she's dating anyone, Amy can't bear to admit there's no man in her life. Instead, she claims she's getting married in six months, figuring she'll never see Tara again, so the lie won't come back to haunt her. Wrong. The next day, Amy learns that her publishing house has just acquired a lifestyle book called Simply Beautiful by none other than Tara---and that Amy's job will be to make it a bestseller. Now she'll not only have to promote her nemesis to the media, she'll also have to dig up a temporary Mr. Right. When she enlists a commitment-phobic mystery writer as the pawn in her game of payback, she stumbles on the surprising truth about Tara's \"lifestyle\"---and her own fears about falling in love. What follows is a laugh-out-loud story of betrayal, reconciliation, romance, and the unbreakable bonds of friendship.

Would you work in a nuclear power plant on a daily basis?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These 250 delicately calibrated questions confront head-on what we stand for and what we value--and what stakes we'd sacrifice for those beliefs. With the same insight and wit that have made the If . . . series and How Far Will You Go? wildly and enduringly popular, Would You? is an endlessly fascinating exercise, a penetrating look into our moral and ethical selves.",

        "Description": "In MARIE ANTOINETTE, Evelyn Lever draws on a variety of resources, including diaries, letters, and firsthand accounts, to write this sumptuous, addictive delight. From family life in Vienna to the choke of the guillotine, this gripping work combines a fast-paced historical narrative with all the elements of scandalous fiction: Marie's wedding at Versailles to Louis XVI, the French court, boredom, hypocrisy, loneliness, allies, enemies, scandal, intrigue, sex, peasant riots, the fall of the Bastille, mob rule in Paris, imprisonment, and, finally, execution.From primary source documents Lever fashions an insightful glimpse into the French court at Versailles. The characters of court are expertly drawn. There is the dashing Axel Fersen, Marie's great love; Maria Theresa, the scheming mother trying to place her daughter on the Hapsburg throne; the legendary Madame du Barry, lover to Louis XV; and, of course, Marie herself. Luxuriously evocative of the Versailles court, historically sharp and witty, and detailing the compelling story of Marie Antoinette's life, Evelyn Lever's biography entrances readers.",

In Ruins is a meditation on ruins and, most particularly, a history of our fascination with them.When we contemplate ruins, Woodward suggests, we contemplate the prospect of the future. Ruins are also the jigsaw pieces of what once was, the clues to a past whose allure is heightened by the fact that it has vanished. And, finally, Woodward shows us how ruins serve as the source of inspiration for the artist who sees beauty in decay and desolation; he quotes by way of example what he calls the finest sonnet Shelley ever wrote: \"Round the decay/Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare/The lone and level sands stretch far away.\"",
