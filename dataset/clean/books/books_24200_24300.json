        "Description": "In spring, the hills and meadows of Texas and Wyoming are ablaze with the reds, oranges, and yellows of the Indian Paintbrush.  How this striking plant received its name is told in an old Indian legend.Many years ago, when the People traveled the Plains, a young Indian boy had a Dream-Vision in which it was revealed that one day he would create a painting that was as pure as the colors of the evening sky at sunset. The boy grew up to become the painter of the tribe, but although he found a pure white buckskin for a canvas and made paints from the brightest flowers and the reddest berries, he could not capture the sunset.How the young Indian artist finally fulfills his Dream-Vision is lovingly told and illustrated by Tomie dePaola, in words and pictures that capture the spirit and beauty of this dramatic legend.",

        "Authors": "By Woolf, Virginia",
        "Description": "One of the most distinguished critics and innovative authors of the twentieth century, Virginia Woolf published two novels before this collection appeared in 1921. However, it was these early stories that first earned her a reputation as a writer with \"the liveliest imagination and most delicate style of her time.\" Influenced by Joyce, Proust, and the theories of William James, Bergson, and Freud, she strove to write a new fiction that emphasized the continuous flow of consciousness, time's passage as both a series of sequential moments and a longer flow of years and centuries, and the essential indefinability of character.Readers can discover these and other aspects of her influential style in the eight stories collected here, among them a delightful, feminist put-down of the male intellect in \"A Society\" and a brilliant and sensitive portrayal of nature in \"Kew Gardens.\" Also included are \"An Unwritten Novel,\" \"The String Quartet,\" \"A Haunted House,\" \"Blue & Green,\" \"The Mark on the Wall,\" and the title story.In recent years, Woolf's fiction, feminism, and high-minded sensibilities have earned her an ever-growing audience of readers. This splendid collection offers those readers not only the inestimable pleasures of the stories themselves, but an excellent entr\u00e9e into the larger body of Woolf's work.",

Bumping along in his coach, the amiable parson buttonholes us with tales of his encounters with all manner of men and women - particularly the attractive ones. And, as drama piles upon drama, anecdote, flirtation and digression, his destination takes second place to an exhilarating voyage of emotional discovery. Interweaving sharp wit with gaiety, irony with sentiment, Sterne creates a deliberately artless novel which calls to mind the modernism of Virginia Woolf, James Joyce and Samuel Beckett. In A Sentimental Journey, Woolf declared, 'we are as close to life as we can be'.",

It is the story of the men and women who built the St. Louis, the George Washington, and the Golden Gate bridges, drawing not only on their mastery of numbers but on their gifts for persuasion and self-promotion. It is an account of triumphs and ignominious disasters (including the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which literally twisted itself apart in a high wind). And throughout this grandly engaging book, Petroski lets us see how bridges became the \"symbols and souls\" of our civilization, as well as testaments to their builders' vision, ingenuity, and perseverance.\"Seamlessly linked...With astonishing scope and generosity of view, Mr. Petroski places the tradition of American bridge-building in perspective.\"--New York Times Book Review",

Starting from Merton's entrance into the Abbey of Gethsemani in 1941, he highlights the development of Merton's monastic life against the cultural background of the American experience and the vast upheavals in the Roman Catholic Church, thus showing how his writings and continuing influence can only be understood against the background of his contemplative experience as a Trappist monk. Father Timothy Kelley, the current abbot of the Abbey of Gethsemani and a former novice under Merton, provides a foreword. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)",

Through vivid portraits of teenagers in Ohio and Indiana, Tom Shachtmanoffers an account of Amish life as a mirror to the soul-searching and questing that we recognize as a generally intrinsic part of adolescence.The trappings of the Amish way of life\u2014the \u201cplain\u201d clothes and electricity-free farms\u2014conceal the communities\u2019 mystery: how they manage to retain their young people and perpetuate themselves generation after generation. The key to this is the rumspringa, when Amish youth are allowed to live outside the bounds of their faith, experimenting with alcohol, premarital sex, trendy clothes, telephones, drugs, and wild parties. By allowing them such freedom, their parents hope they will learn enough to help them make the most important decision of their lives\u2014whether to be baptized as Christians, join the church, and forever give up worldly ways, or to remain out in the world.In this searching book, Shachtman draws on his skills as a documentarian to capture young people on the cusp of a fateful decision, and to give us an original and deeply affecting portrait of the Amish as a whole.",

Despite the \"solutions\" put forth by our country's leaders - seize more ships, impose harsher jail sentences, pursue foreign drug lords - the government's policies have failed to reduce drug abuse and drug crime. Today, as illegal drugs continue to disrupt our schools, our workplaces, and our communities, we face once again this crucial question: Does anything work?It is easy to get discouraged by the magnitude of America's drug habit and by the failures of the multibillion-dollar \"war on drugs,\" but Mathea Falco argues that we need not give in to such despair. One of our nation's leading experts on drug abuse, Falco showcases effective prevention, treatment, and law enforcement strategies from across the country to reveal what really works in the fight against drugs. Success stories include a school program in Kansas City that cuts youngsters' drug use by half; a neighborhood group in Washington, D.C., that is driving drug dealers off the streets; an anti-drug coalition in Miami that is creating new political priorities; and a treatment program in Los Angeles that keeps people off cocaine.For concerned citizens, parents, and government officials alike, The Making of a Drug-Free America offers workable courses of action that are already changing lives and transforming communities.",

        "Authors": "By Finnamore, Suzanne",
        "Description": "Otherwise Engaged is Suzanne Finnamore's wickedly funny account of an intelligent, rational woman's transformation into the harpy of anxieties that is the bride-to-be. When Michael pops the question, Eve is deliriously happy. She tells grocery clerks. She subscribes to bridal magazines. She delights in the rainbows that shower from the one-carat (okay, .81-carat) ring on her hand. For two days. As the cumulative stresses of ordering invitations, finding a dress, and organizing the Perfect Honeymoon fry Eve's nerves, the very real prospect of being with one man for the rest of her days reverberates through her consciousness like a Chinese gong. Suddenly the sight of Michael's discarded socks on the floor and his passing mentions of his former live-in French girlfriend incite doubt, argument, and public fainting. Uproarious, insightful, tender, Otherwise Engaged dashes our soap-bubble fantasies in favor of a hilariously realistic walk to the alter.",

        "Description": "Max Pauling, ex-CIA, ex-State Department, has taken early retirement to become a flight instructor in New Mexico. A colleague, also \"retired,\" shows up, offering a contract to fly medical supplies into Havana. This revs up Pauling's engines in several senses. Despite the misgivings of Jessica, his live-in lover, he takes the deal. After flying a roundabout route that takes him through Mexico, Miami, and Colombia, he lands in Havana, waiting for a contact who will \"help him with his Spanish.\"The first sight of her is both breathtaking - she is a beauty - and frustrating: She wants to move at her own pace. Max is a man of action, and waiting for the action to begin does nothing for his mood or blood pressure. The covert reason for their collaboration is to uncover the truth about an intense competition between rival U.S. pharmaceutical companies for access to Cuba's surprisingly high-quality anti-cancer research.Meanwhile, a former U.S. senator is leading a mission to Cuba to discuss the possibility of lessening tensions between the two countries, looking to ease America's controversial commercial embargo. And perhaps he has another mission, as well....",

        "Title": "Lady of Spain",
        "Authors": "By Taylor, Robert Love",
        "Description": "Lady of Spain is about love in the 1950s, when the solution to failed marriage was separate bedrooms and teenage sex was a furtive activity; when everybody - old and young - slow danced to romantic ballads played on the accordion. \"Lady of Spain, I adore you...\"The dancers are Bill and Billy Haynes, father and son, both spinning in the orbit of their Lady of Spain, Mrs. Haynes. Billy describes her: \"Have I said that my mother was a beautiful woman? She was. I found this somewhat of an embarrassment, another instance of how my family was not right. Mothers were supposed to be plump and gray, slightly younger versions of grandmothers, but mine was trim and dark, with auburn hair and hazel eyes that flashed brilliantly. Around the house during the summer she wore shorts and high-heeled wedge sandals, usually with a halter top...\"Bill is a compulsive philanderer. And Billy is at a sexual crossroads. By the end of their story, Bill has lost his Lady of Spain and Billy has traded her in for the girl who took his eagerly offered virginity. Billy's sexual coming-of-age is complicated by acute and persistent memories: of sales trips taken with his father and the visits they paid to ladies; of his mother's insistence that Billy play his accordion for her \"patients\" at a Veterans' Hospital party; of muffled quarrels and crying from the bedroom in the family's vacation cabin; of the feel of a satin gown against a boy's body and lipstick on his lips; of the inside of a DeSoto, front seat and back; of nakedness on the floor of a shoe store basement.Lady of Spain, unabashedly confronts the force of male sexuality, its obsessive grip, its complexity, its pain, its joy, and its music.",
