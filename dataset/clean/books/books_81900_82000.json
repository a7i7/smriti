        "Title": "Passages to the Presidency: From Campaigning to Governing",
        "Authors": "By Jones, Charles O.",
        "Description": "The standard view of the transition is based on a distinction between campaigning and governing, with election day as the marker: campaigning before, preparing to govern after. Yet changes are blurring the distinction between the two activities. The Clinton transition in 1992 is the watershed case. Dubbed the \"worst\" for failing to meet many of the standard tests, Clinton and his aides, nevertheless, were attuned to a campaigning style of governing that was fine-tuned after the 1994 mid-term election.Future transitions will be judged by a revised set of expectations. The conventional rules will be supplemented by tests that account for campaigning as integral to governing. What is called the \"permanent campaign\" is upon us. Presidents in the 21st century will prepare to govern more publicly from the start, anxious to establish and enhance their status in a more communal style of governing.This book considers the critical ten weeks of transition for recent party changes in the White House (Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Clinton) and signals a pivotal change for the future. Charles Jones identifies the conventional expectations for an effective transition in regard to such topics as dismantling the campaign, connecting with Congress, establishing a theme, and relating to the press.",

        "Description": "Henry Mitchell wrote for the Washington Post from the early 1970s to 1991. He was best known for his gardening columns, some of which have been gathered in two beloved books, The Essential Earthman and One Man\u2019s Garden. In addition to his gardening columns, Mr. Mitchell also wrote feature stories and for years had a general interest column that appeared on Fridays under the title Any Day. This book collects the most enduring of those brilliant columns. Henry Mitchell was a bit of a curmudgeon. He had an eye for cant and an even sharper eye for the deeper truths of reality. Never pompous, his columns were frequently hilarious. He could make you cry, he could make you weep and he could catch you up in the midst of a busy, confusing day and make you pause and reflect: Hey, look at this! He will make you feel good about being a flawed human, and he will even make you think that mortality isn\u2019t so bad.Readers who have enjoyed The Essential Earthman and One Man\u2019s Garden will thrill to discover their favorite author\u2019s additional accomplishments as they are represented in this lovely book. The illustrations are by Susan Davis, a gifted Maryland artist whose work accompanied many of Henry\u2019s columns during the 1980s and 1990s.",

Skeptics and True Believersis the culmination of that search\u2014a passionate, ever-inquisitive statement that science and religion can mutually reinforce the way we experience the world.Acknowledging that the scientific and the spiritual communities are increasingly split, Raymo builds strong bridges between them. He illustrates his argument with an array of thought-provoking stories, such as the remarkable migratory flight of a small bird called the red knot; the long, glorious glide of the Comet Hyakutake across the night sky; a hilarious alien abduction that didn't happen. Together, they are compelling evidence that religion should embrace the reliable knowledge of the world that science provides, while at the same time science should respect and nourish humankind's need for spiritual sustenance. \"Miracles are explainable,\" Raymo paraphrases the writer Tim Robinson, \"it is the explanations that are miraculous.\"For anyone drawn to reflect on life's meaning and purpose, Chet Raymo's uncompromising skepticism and reverence for mystery will affirm and inspire.",

        "Description": "He knows where Jimmy Hoffa was buried. He knows how to perform a \"hit\" seamlessly, having done so dozens of times for everyone from John Gotti on down. He has worked with big-time members of the underworld whose names read like something from a Mafia Who's Who - Fat Tony Salerno, Nicky Barnes, Chin Gigante, Crazy Joe Gallo, Jimmy Coonan, Mad Dog Sullivan. And he's telling it all in Contract Killer.Donald \"Tony the Greek\" Frankos, ex-Navy boxer, pimp, heroin dealer, burglar, loan shark, and contract killer, the \"last person anyone thought would rat,\" has turned state's evidence. One result is that John Gotti has offered $300,000 for Frankos's head; another is Contract Killer - a completely candid, extraordinarily vivid account of thirty years in organized crime. The result is the \"down and dirty truth\" - a chillingly fascinating story, an expose of some of the underworld's biggest secrets, and a shocking confession of his participation in the murder of Jimmy Hoffa.Co-authors William Hoffman and Lake Headley (whom Vincent Bugliosi called the \"the best p.i. in the world\") logged over 40,000 miles in verifying what Frankos said was the \"down and dirty truth\" of his life at the center of the underworld. Here are the most intimate details of Jimmy Hoffa's death, dismemberment, and burial - down to the lock of his hair saved for good luck; a portrayal of John Gotti in prison, where Frankos took the young, future godfather under his wing and showed him the ropes and where Gotti used fake furlough passes to sell drugs; Frankos's involvement in the Pierre Hotel heist, one of the biggest robberies of the decade; and for the first time the nitty-gritty truth behind the contract killing of Joey Gallo.Told in Frankos's own voice, Contract Killer is more than an extraordinarily vivid and detailed account of events expertly told and documented by Hoffman and Headley. It will spark the reopening of many investigations and may prove to be the most explosive and disturbing portrait of the mob yet.",

        "Title": "Re-engage!: America and the World After Bush: An Informed Citizen's Guide",
        "Authors": "By Cobban, Helena",
        "Description": "A veteran international journalist gives us a concise, readable guide that provides a new vision for the United States in the global community. Since 9/11, the United States has pursued a foreign policy some have called a \"control paradigm\"-a unilateral domination of world affairs through military means that tries to keep the lid on insecurity without addressing root causes or protecting human rights. The Bush administration's energetic use of this approach has ripped the fabric of America's relationship with the rest of the world. In this concise guide, veteran journalist Helena Cobban proposes moving the United States away from the control paradigm to a policy of global inclusion. Global inclusion seeks to repair the U.S. relationship with other countries, recommit the United States to effective participation in the United Nations and other multilateral institutions, and ground U.S. foreign policy firmly in the principle of human equality. It also involves moving away from the language of threats and fear to a language of challenge and possibility. This book outlines how a global inclusion policy would address key challenges faced not only by Americans but by the 95 percent of humanity who are not Americans: - Challenges of terrorism and weapons proliferation. - Growing global inequality.  - Rights abuses worldwide.  - Climate change.  - Shifting international power balances. Cobban reminds readers we do not need to do any of these things alone. Since 9/11, she has traveled to 18 foreign countries on four continents. She has heard how deep the desire is among people in China, sub-Saharan Africa, the Muslim world, Europe, and elsewhere for the United States to rejoin the world community on a sound and cooperative basis. In heartfelt, accessible prose with highly readable tables, graphics, websites, and other resources, she shows how we can re-engage as neighbors, as a country, and as a trusted international partner.",

        "Title": "Libertarianism: A Primer",
        "Authors": "By Boaz, David",
        "Description": "Tens of millions of Americans, from Generation X-ers to baby boomers and beyond, are rediscovering libertarianism, a visionary alternative to the tired party orthodoxies of left and right. In 1995 a Gallup poll found that 52 percent of Americans said \"the federal government has become so large and powerful that it poses an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens.\" Later that year,The Wall Street Journal concurred, saying: \"Because of their growing disdain for government, more and more Americans appear to be driftingoften unwittinglytoward a libertarian philosophy.\"Libertarianism is hardly new, but its framework for liberty under law and economic progress makes it especially suited for the dynamic new era we are now entering. In the United States, the bureaucratic leviathan is newly threatened by a resurgence of the libertarian ideas upon which the country was founded. We are witnessing a breakdown of all the cherished beliefs of the welfare-warfare state. Americans have seen the failure of big government. Now, in the 1990s, we are ready to apply the lessons of this century to make the next one the century not of the state but of the free individual. David Boaz presents the essential guidebook to the libertarian perspective, detailing its roots, central tenets, solutions to contemporary policy dilemmas, and future in American politics. He confronts head-on the tough questions frequently posed to libertarians: What about inequality? Who protects the environment? What ties people together if they are essentially self-interested? A concluding section, \"Are You a Libertarian?\" gives readers a chance to explore the substance of their own beliefs.Libertarianism is must reading for understanding one of the most exciting and hopeful movements of our time.",

        "Description": "\"Rebuilding KBW is eloquent testimony to the strength, spirit, and will of the people of our city.\" ?Richard D. Parsons, Chief Executive Officer, AOL Time Warner, Inc \"There are no management manuals for rebuilding a firm after the tragedy that KBW suffered on 9/11. KBW?s success in their restoration is a testament to the skill and determination of the people at the firm and the deeply felt need of their friends and supporters throughout the country to help them succeed. That business success was matched by their concern for the families of those who did not survive the 9/11tragedy. As a member of one of those families and a longtime friend and client of the firm, I am deeply moved by its story. KBW is, at the same time, but one example of the strength and spirit of Americans and New Yorkers who cannot be defeated by the forces of evil.\"  ?Thomas S. Johnson, Chairman and CEO, GreenPoint Financia No one would have blamed the management and employees of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods for giving up. The September 11 terrorist attack killed one-third of the company?s staff and obliterated its headquarters. Yet the men and women of KBW refused to quit. Triumph Over Tragedy tells the powerful and compelling story of KBW?s destruction and rebirth. Firsthand accounts from dozens of staff members at all levels describe the horrifying events of September 11, recall the devastation and suffering in the aftermath of the tragedy, and explain how, in the face of overwhelming destruction, they found the will and resources to survive and thrive The people of KBW set a new standard for disaster recovery and redefined our understanding of how much loss one company can endure and still rebuild. Their story offers lessons of hope and renewal that will inspire anyone struggling with personal or professional loss due to unforeseen tragedy",

        "Title": "Overtime! The Election 2000 Thriller",
        "Authors": "By Sabato, Larry J. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Read  never-before-published  anecdotes, commentaries, and interviews from key insiders about the most exciting Presidential Election in our nation's history!     Provides unique, riveting insider stories and analyses of the election that will capture readers' attention while helping them to understand why things happened as they did.   Contributors include: George Terwilliger (Bush legal team); Ron Klain and Jeremy Bash (Gore legal team); Donnie Fowler (Gore campaign advisor); Tom Fiedler (Editor,  Miami Herald); Larry J. Sabato and Joshua Scott (University of Virginia); Chuck Babbington (Washington Post); Diana Owens (Georgetown University); Tim Burger (NY Daily News); Jake Tapper (Salon.com/CNN); and Rhodes Cook (The Rhodes Cook Letter).   Offers never-before-published information about Election 2000!    Edited by Larry Sabato, this collection of first-hand stories and analyses offers stunning insights into \"the election of the century\" from the people who were there.  George Terwilliger from the Bush legal team and Ron Klain and Jeremy Bash from the Gore legal team provide insider accounts of the Florida ballot recount battle. Tim Burger of the  NY Daily News  writes a previously unpublished story about the Bush DUI, Diana Owen from Georgetown University provides unique coverage of the media consortium recount, and Tom Fiedler, editor of the  Miami Herald -which was at the \"center of the storm\"- writes the introductory chapter. Overtime stands far out from the crowd of books on Election 2000 because it contains original, never-before-seen material and because it offers a wide spectrum of insider views, providing a balance of journalistic, academic, and campaigner accounts.  Because it combines political journalism with solid political science research, it is both highly readable and enlightening.  And because Overtime was written and published after the initial rush of post-election books, it includes data and stories that have been revealed since the first wave hit the bookstands.  Overtime is not only an entertaining read with a unique insider's view, but will help readers truly make sense of this complex and historic election.  It walks readers through the story of the election, offers a context for understanding why things happened as they did, and leaves them with a more meaningful appreciation of the powerful effects this election had, and will continue to have, on our political system.   Larry J. Sabato  is at the  University of Virginia. According to The Wall Street Journal, Dr. Sabato is \"probably the most quoted college professor in the land.\" The Washington Post calls him \"the Mark McGwire of political analysts.\"  He has appeared on dozens of nationally broadcast television shows, including \"60 Minutes\", \"Nightline\", \"Face the Nation\", \"The Today Show\", \"Good Morning America\", \"48 Hours\", \"Larry King Live,\" and \"The Jim Lehrer News Hour.\"  Dr. Sabato is the Director of Government Studies at the University of Virginia and is the recipient of more than two dozen major scholarships, grants, and academic awards, and has written 19 books, including: Feeding Frenzy: How Attack Journalism Has Transformed American Politics (Lanahan, ISBN 0965268780); Peep Show: Media and Politics in an Age of Scandal (Rowman & Littlefield, ISBN 0742500101); and Dirty Little Secrets: The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics (Random House, ISBN 0812924991).",
