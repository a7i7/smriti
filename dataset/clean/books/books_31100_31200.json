        "Title": "Dr. Faustus (Dover Thrift Editions)",
        "Authors": "By Marlowe, Christopher",
        "Description": "One of the most durable myths in Western culture, the story of Faust tells of a learned German doctor who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power. Early enactments of Faust's damnation were often the raffish fare of clowns and low comedians. But the young Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe (1564\u20131593) recognized in the story of Faust's temptation and fall the elements of tragedy.In his epic treatment of the Faust legend, Marlowe retains much of the rich phantasmagoria of its origins. There are florid visions of an enraged Lucifer, dueling angels, the Seven Deadly Sins, Faustus tormenting the Pope, and his summoning of the spirit of Alexander the Great. But the playwright created equally powerful scenes that invest the work with tragic dignity, among them the doomed man's calling upon Christ to save him and his ultimate rejection of salvation for the embrace of Helen of Troy.With immense poetic skill, and psychological insight that foreshadowed the later work of Shakespeare and the Jacobean playwrights, Marlowe created in Dr. Faustus one of the first true tragedies in English. Vividly dramatic, rich in poetic grandeur, this classic play remains a robust and lively exemplar of the glories of Elizabethan drama.",

        "Description": "This book challenges Christians to think. Committed lay Christians, says Cobb, are already theologians; he wants them to realize this and\u00a0then to become good theologians. Laypersons are just as capable as professional theologians of intellectual hard work, but they no longer expect the church to ask this of them. Cobb discusses why it is important for Christians to think about their own beliefs and assumptions. He encourages readers to find and become conversation partners. He also suggests steps a Christian's thinking may take; sources the individual can draw on, including how professionals can help; and where this thinking may lead. Cobb asserts that if there is a renewal of thinking in the church, there will be church renewal. The goal is to focus and sharpen one's thinking so that it is one's own, and to apply that thinking to one's being and acting. Each chapter ends with a section \"Doing Your Theology\" which is a list of questions for reflection and discussion. Chapter titles include: On Becoming What You Are: A Theologian; Ethics and Theology; Shaping Up; Biblical Authority; Christians and Jews; Professionals: Help and Hindrance; Christian Counterattack; A Critique of Economics; A Critique of the University; An Afterword on Church Theology",

In this enlightening book, Carol Tavris unmasks the widespread but invisible custom -- pervasive in the social sciences, medicine, law, and history -- of treating men as the normal standard, women as abnormal. Tavris expands our vision of normalcy by illuminating the similarities between women and men and showing that the real differences lie not in gender, but in power, resources, and life experiences.

        "Description": "\"Izaak Walton was my excuse to go to England. I had been thinking through ideas to get money from Yale in the form of a traveling fellowship for two years, and several attempts had failed. My last--and best--idea was to suggest to the fellowship committee that I go to England and fish in the footsteps of a legitimate seventeenth-century author, Izaak Walton, who wrote The Compleat Angler, the third most frequently reprinted book in the English language, one that has been in print for over three hundred years. I told them during my interview that Walton&#39;s words spoke to me, that fishing was my passion, and that his book represented and defended every facet of the art more lucidly than I ever could.\"-- James ProsekJames Prosek has been called \"the Audubon of the fishing world\" by the New York Times. A passionate fisherman and talented artist from a young age, he published two illustrated books on fish and fishing while still an undergraduate at Yale. After winning a traveling fellowship to follow in the footsteps of Izaak Walton, The Compleat Angler became his obsession. He was fascinated by Walton, a humble man who won the friendship of kings, and he was intrigued by the book&#39;s philosophies concerning the timelessness and immortality that could be achieved by fishing. Although Walton was sixty when The Compleat Angler was published and Prosek only twenty when he set off to visit England, they each had traits in common: a love of fishing and an extraordinary ability to make friends.This is the story of a young man&#39;s pilgrimage through England, fishing the waters that are now privately held.  Along with wonderful stories about good times, great fishing, and fine eating, this trip becomes an exploration of Waltonian ideals: how to live with humor, wisdom, contentment, and simplicity.The original watercolors complementing the text are wonderful.  Like Walton&#39;s book, The Complete Angler is not about fishing but about life.  Or rather, it is about fishing--but fishing is life.",

I no see not that that frog has nothing of better than another.'\"You would probably be hard-pressed to identify the author of the above passage as Mark Twain. And no wonder: this little bit of Twain's wit is part of a translation he made from a French translation of his celebrated \"Frog\" tale. The French translation was published in the Revue des Deux Mondes, the \"Review of Some Two Worlds,\" as Twain styled it. The re-translation Twain made into English was supposed to be a clear demonstration of the French translator's incompetence. In any case, Twain, trusty tongue in cheek, obviously felt his re-translation to be the only suitable response to the French rendering of his inimitable tale. Certainly, the subtleties (such as they are) of the new English version will delight any language student.But \u2014 alas and alack \u2014 imagine Twain's consternation (after having given his pitiable French imitator his just desserts) upon learning that the Calaveras County incident had been recorded in Greece two thousand years earlier. Can the reader believe it? Do not confuse this book with the original story alone. It contains the original, the French \"traduction,\" Twain's re-translation, and a wealth of reflection by Twain. It is the only \"complete\" Jumping Frog.",

You'll meet great thinkers such as Pythagoras, Pascal, Pavlov, and Parkinson; ponder the origins and fate of the universe; and grasp why Freud and Marx are so important, even if they were ultimately wrong.From the sacred to the profane, the economic to the existential, chaos theory to the global village, Eureka! translates the most significant theories, laws, principles, and paradoxes into powerful, clear, and entertaining stories.

Both provide a superb introduction to the keen social perception, rich characterization, and narrative command of this Russian master.

        "Authors": "By Ibsen, Henrik",
        "Description": "The innovative dramas of Henrik Ibsen created a sensation among 19th-century audiences with their mordant attacks on social conventions. Among the finest of these ground-breaking works was Ghosts, first performed in 1881. In it, the playwright assailed the hypocrisy of moral codes, offering a daring treatment of such then-taboo issues as infidelity, venereal disease, and illegitimacy. Ibsen substituted the modern scientific idea of heredity for the ancient Greek concept of fate, exposing hidden sins of the past as the roots of corruption.The sins of the past are at the heart of the play, whose haunted heroine, Mrs. Helen Alving, has accepted her pastor's counsel and endured her husband's many infidelities in silence. Ten years after Alving's death, she is to dedicate an orphanage in his memory. Her son Oswald, kept innocent of his father's profligacy, returns home for the dedication. Oswald's attraction to the housemaid \u2014 in reality, his half-sister \u2014 conjures up the ghost of his parents' unhappy marriage. This disastrous romance, along with Oswald's increasing symptoms of the venereal disease inherited from his father, force Mrs. Alving to confront her own \"ghosts.\"A powerful and engrossing psychological drama, Ghosts serves as an excellent entr\u00e9e to Ibsen's other works and helps confirm his status as \"the father of modern drama.\"",

        "Authors": "By Pirandello, Luigi and Storer, Edward",
        "Description": "One of the major figures of modern theater, Luigi Pirandello (1867\u20131936) wrote dramas and satires that sparked controversy with their radical departures from conventional theatrical techniques. His most celebrated work, Six Characters in Search of an Author, embodies the Nobel Prize-winning playwright's innovations by presenting an open-ended drama on a stage without sets.First performed in 1923, this intellectual comedy introduces six individuals to a stage where a company of actors has assembled for a rehearsal. Claiming to be the incomplete, unused creations of an author's imagination, they demand lines for a story that will explain the details of their lives. In ensuing scenes, these \"real-life characters,\" all professing to be part of an extended family, produce a drama of sorts \u2014 punctuated by disagreements, interruptions, and arguments. In the end they are dismissed by the irate manager, their dilemma unsolved and the \"truth\" a matter of individual viewpoints.A tour de force exploring the many faces of reality, this classic is now available in an inexpensive edition that will be welcomed by amateur theatrical groups as well as students of drama.",
