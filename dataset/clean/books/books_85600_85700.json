Thassadit Amzwar's blissful exuberance both entrances and puzzles the melancholic Russell. How can this refugee from perpetual terror be so happy? Won't someone so open and alive come to serious harm? Wondering how to protect her, Russell researches her war-torn country and skims through popular happiness manuals. Might her condition be hyperthymia? Hypomania? Russell's amateur inquiries lead him to college counselor Candace Weld, who also falls under Thassa's spell. Dubbed Miss Generosity by her classmates, Thassa's joyful personality comes to the attention of the notorious geneticist and advocate for genomic enhancement, Thomas Kurton, whose research leads him to announce the genotype for happiness. Russell and Candace, now lovers, fail to protect Thassa from the growing media circus. Thassa's congenital optimism is soon severely tested. Devoured by the public as a living prophecy, her genetic secret will transform both Russell and Kurton, as well as the country at large. What will happen to life when science identifies the genetic basis of happiness? Who will own the patent? Do we dare revise our own temperaments? Funny, fast, and finally magical, Generosity celebrates both science and the freed imagination. In his most exuberant book yet, Richard Powers asks us to consider the big questions facing humankind as we begin to rewrite our own existence.",

        "Authors": "By Crandall, Robert W. and Furchtgott-Roth, Harold",
        "Description": "In 1984, Congress simultaneously eliminated state-local regulation of cable television rates and banned telephone companies from offering cable service in their own franchise areas. Five years later, the General Accounting Office discovered that basic cable rates had risen more than four times as rapidly as the overall consumer price level since rate deregulation. As a result, Congress began to move to reimpose cable rate regulation once again, finally succeeding (over President Bush's veto) in 1992.In this book, Robert Crandall and Harold Furchtgott-Roth examine the case of reregulating cable television and find that viewers gained far more than they lost during the brief deregulatory era because cable services expanded so rapidly in the deregulated environment. Moreover, they show that new technologies, such as direct-broadcast satellites, are likely to provide considerable market discipline for cable operators in the next few years, weakening any case for rate regulation. Given regulation's history of impeding innovation, they conclude that economic welfare is more likely to be enhanced by policies aimed at encouraging new entry into video services than by rate regulation.",

And isn\u2019t that just like this journey we\u2019re all on?\u201dWith wit, warmhearted humor, irresistible grace, and keen insights, Kathy and Ellie urge you to take a generous helping of the richly flavored abundant life that only God can give. They share how the soul-satisfying seasonings of faith, hope, and love can transform your attitude, outlook, and actions. Tied to their popular Spaghetti for the Soul Conferences, the authors dish up in this book biblical truths with lively storytelling and even some mouthwatering family recipes to help you experience fully a renewed zest for the God who invites you to \u201ctaste and see.\u201d",

        "Description": "Why do I have to repeat everything? Why does every conversation end in an argument? Communicating with our children. Conversing. Connecting. When did it become so difficult? And how do we begin to change it for the better? This book was designed to help parents answer these important questions, and it is based on two fundamental ideas: The first is that there are no bad children, and no deliberately bad parents -- but that sometimes, despite the best of intentions on both sides, there can be bad relationships between parents and children. The second is that, as parents, we must do everything we can to save those relationships, to reach out and really communicate with our children, because it is only through talking to them that we can create an environment for inspiration and change. In this compelling book, Shmuley Boteach, passionate social commentator and outspoken relationship guru, walks you through the critical conversations, including: cherishing childhood; developing intellectual curiosity; knowing who you are and what you want to become; learning to forgive; realizing the importance of family and tradition; being fearless and courageous. As a father of eight, Rabbi Shmuley speaks from a wealth of experience. He has written a book for parents of children of all ages, from toddlers, who are just beginning to become aware of the world around them, to adolescents, who must learn to navigate all sorts of tricky social and academic pressures. 10 Conversations will help you stay connected to your children so that they develop the kind of strong moral character that leads to rich, meaningful lives.",

        "Title": "Total Access: A Journey to the Center of the NFL Universe",
        "Authors": "By Eisen, Rich",
        "Description": "Rich Eisen always wanted to write a book, not only because he has a lotof fun, interesting stories he\u2019s been dying to share with everyone, but also becausehe\u2019s interviewed hundreds of athletes---many of whom like torefer to themselves in the third person. In his eleven years as a nationaltelevision sportscaster, Rich Eisen has been envious of those athletesbecause Rich Eisen has never been able to do that on his job, so thehost of NFL Network decided to write a book and use it as an admittedlyfeeble excuse to go third-person on everybody. Not throughout the wholebook, of course. That may get quite exhausting for the reader. But foran entire book jacket? Well, Rich Eisen was all over that.\u00a0That\u2019s the why behind this book. As for the how, Rich Eisen justtook it one sentence at a time and hoped for the best. You know, startwith a few words and turn those words into sentences which turned intoparagraphs and chapters and, eventually, into this book. Rich Eisendidn\u2019t worry about the big picture and just kept focusing on the thingsthat he could control---the keyboard, the ON/OFF button on hiscomputer, his dictionary, his thesaurus, and last---but certainly notleast---the spell-check on his word processing program. One day, whenit\u2019s all over, only then will Rich Eisen look back on his career andtry to put it all in perspective, but right now Rich Eisen absolutelyknows he would not be where he is today without his spell-check.\u00a0By now you must be wondering: What\u2019s this book about? It\u2019s about ajourney. It\u2019s about eating, living, and breathing the most popular sportin the history of America. The passion. The pageantry. The pigskin.Thanks to his role as host of the NFL Network\u2019s signature program, NFL TotalAccess, Rich Eisen gets to go to virtually every event on the NFLCalendar---the Super Bowl, the Pro Bowl, the Scouting Combine, the NFLDraft, and the Hall of Fame Induction Weekend. You name it, Rich Eisenis there. And thanks to this book, you can go along for the ride with him---in front of the camera interviewing league MVPs and formerpresidents of the United States or behind the scenes with some of thegame\u2019s all-time greats like Deion Sanders, Ray Lewis, and Brett Favre,just to name a few. I mean, Rich Eisen doesn\u2019t want to name-drop. Inall seriousness, Rich Eisen doesn\u2019t have an ego problem.\u00a0At any rate, if you love the NFL (and who doesn\u2019t), then this book isfor you. If you\u2019re curious what it would be like to live the sportyear-round, this book is for you. You see, it\u2019s not all about RichEisen. It\u2019s about you reading this book and enjoying it to itsfullest. At least Rich Eisen hopes you will.\u00a0Advance Praise for Total Access:\u201cI've always admired Rich Eisen\u2019s work, so it's no surprise to me that his book is very entertaining.\u00a0 What is a surprise is that he's somehow found time to write it in between the NFL Network\u2019s 6,347 hours of coverage of weak-side linebackers who could be draft-sleepers.\u00a0 That sort of programming and this book about it are both genuine public services.\u201d---Bob Costas\u201cA lot of things in our lives are far less than as advertised, but this book advertises Total Access and gives you Total Access. That\u2019s right. Total Access! I\u2019m not kidding. I liked this book and I\u2019m not a reader.\u201d---Tony Kornheiser, columnist for The Washington Post and co-host for ESPN\u2019s Pardon the Interruption\u201cRich uses his great sense of humor to detail the life of an on-air NFL personality. It is a world I know well, but still I couldn't stop turning the pages. It is a great read---a must for anyone who loves television and Pro Football.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0---Joe Buck, Fox Sports",

When her husband dies in a car crash--not long after announcing he wants a divorce--Jo Mackenzie packs up her two rowdy boys and moves from London to a dilapidated villa in her seaside hometown. There, she takes over her beloved Gran's knitting shop--a quaint but out-of-date store in desperate need of a facelift. After a rough beginning, Jo soon finds comfort in a \"Stitch and Bitch\" group; a collection of quirky, lively women who share their stories, and their addiction to cake, with warmth and humor. As Jo starts to get the hang of single-parent life in a small town, she relies on her knitting group for support. The women meet every week at the shop on Beach Street and trade gossip and advice as freely as they do a new stitch. But when a new man enters Jo's life, and an A-list actress moves into the local mansion, the knitting club has even more trouble confining the conversation to knit one, purl two. The Beach Street Knitting Society and Yarn Club is an uplifting, winning tale about the healing power of friendship and new beginnings. It's a charming novel that will delight all passionate knitters--and win over befuddled, would-be knitters, too.",

Hillary Clinton had charged this fiercely competitive, meticulously organized chef with bringing 'what's best about American food, wine, and entertaining to the White House.' His sophisticated contemporary food was generally considered some of the best ever served there.\"--Marian Burros, New York TimesWhite House ChefJoin Walter Scheib as he serves up a taste--in stories and recipes--of his eleven years as White House chef under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.Scheib takes readers along on his whirlwind adventure, from his challenging audition process right up until his controversial departure. He describes his approach to meals ranging from the intimate (rooftop parties and surprise birthday celebrations for the Clintons; Tex-Mex brunches for the Bushes) to his creative approach to bringing contemporary American cuisine to the \"people's house\" (including innovative ways to serve state dinners for up to seven hundred people and picnics and holiday menus for several thousand guests).Scheib goes beyond the kitchen and his job as chef. He shares what it is like to be part of President Clinton's motorcade (the \"security bubble\") and inside the White House during 9/11, revealing how he first evacuates his staff and then comes back to fix meals for hundreds of hungry security and rescue personnel. Staying cool under pressure also helps Scheib in other aspects of his job, such as withstanding the often-changing \"temperature\" of the White House and satisfying the culinary sensibilities of two very different first families.",

        "Title": "Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party",
        "Authors": "By Blumenthal, Max",
        "Description": "Over the last year, award-winning journalist and videographer Max Blumenthal has been behind some of the most sensational (and funniest) exposes of Republican machinations. Whether it was his revelation that Sarah Palin was \"anointed\" by a Kenyan priest famous for casting out witches, or his confronting Republican congressional leaders and John McCain's family at the GOP convention about the party's opposition to sex education (and hence, the rise in teen pregnancies like that of Palin's daughter), or his expose of the eccentric multimillionaire theocrat behind California's Prop 8 anti- gay marriage initiative, Blumenthal has become one of the most important and most constantly cited journalists on how fringe movements are becoming the Republican Party mainstream.Republican Gomorrah is a bestiary of dysfunction, scandal and sordidness from the dark heart of the forces that now have a leash on the party. It shows how those forces are the ones that establishment Republicans-like John McCain-have to bow to if they have any hope of running for President. It shows that Sarah Palin was the logical choice of a party in the control of theocrats. But more that just an expose, Republican Gomorrah shows that many of the movement's leading figures have more in common than just the power they command within conservative ranks. Their personal lives have been stained by crisis and scandal: depression, mental illness, extra-marital affairs, struggles with homosexual urges, heavy medication, addiction to pornography, serial domestic abuse, and even murder. Inspired by the work of psychologists Erich Fromm, who asserted that the fear of freedom propels anxiety-ridden people into authoritarian settings, Blumenthal explains in a compelling narrative how a culture of personal crisis has defined the radical right, transforming the nature of the Republican Party for the next generation and setting the stage for the future of American politics.",

The results have been news-making; her students blossom academically, winning essay contests, prizes, and entrance to the country's best colleges.  Armed with a strong sense of who they are and what they think, her students also blossom personally-resisting peer pressure, understanding racial and gender stereotypes, and connecting to the world in which they live.Drawing on over thirty years \"knee deep in adolescence\" as a teacher in a public middle school, Judy Logan shows that it is the very vulnerability of adolescence that makes it a time of tremendous opportunity for emotional, intellectual, and social growth.

        "Title": "Sarah from Alaska: The Sudden Rise and Brutal Education of a New Conservative Superstar",
        "Authors": "By Conroy, Scott and Walshe, Shushannah",
        "Description": "A year after a vice presidential campaign that remains as consequential as it was controversial, Sarah Palin is still the most dynamic yet polarizing Republican in America. Now Scott Conroy and Shushannah Walshe draw on their experiences as embedded reporters on Palin\u2019s campaign, exclusive on-scene coverage of Palin\u2019s post-election struggles in Alaska, and revealing interviews with former McCain/Palin staffers, top political minds, and Palin\u2019s family, friends, and foes in Alaska to tell the remarkable behind-the-scenes story of her improbable rise\u2014and its complicated aftermath. The result is a fair and fascinating portrait of Sarah Palin and of the American political process. Sarah from Alaska illuminates both the talents that helped make Palin a superstar and the traits that became liabilities under the intense pressures of a divisive national campaign. It reveals in riveting detail how Palin\u2019s vice presidential campaign became as dysfunctional as it was secretive, explores the circumstances behind her triumphs and baffling missteps, and provides new context for understanding her values, her political successes in Alaska, and her abrupt resignation from the governorship.  \u201cIt\u2019s easy to turn Sarah Palin into a caricature of either a heroic everywoman or ridiculous dolt,\u201d the authors say, \u201cbut the truth is that she is more complex than either her most passionate defenders or harshest critics give her credit for.\u201d Palin remains ambitious and enormously popular among social conservatives, and her future will be intrinsically interwoven with that of the Republican Party as it struggles to redefine itself and recapture the necessary margin for national political victory in the next decade. That makes Sarah from Alaska essential reading for anyone interested in American politics.",

His novella delivers what he promises. And the introduction is a heads-up plea for authors to ensure that their work will continue to be read after they are no longer around to write any more.\"\"",

        "Description": "Christmas is murder...when you're stranded with a killer  Not even a blizzard can keep Rex Graves away from Swanmere Manor, a secluded Victorian hotel in the English countryside owned by the eccentric Dahlia Smithings. But instead of Christmas cheer, the Scottish barrister finds a dead guest. Was it a stroke that killed old Mr. Lawdry? Or an almond tart laced with poison?  When more guests die, all hopes for a jolly holiday are dashed. Snowbound and terrified, no one can escape the cold-blooded killer. Rex takes it upon himself to unravel the mystery. A biography of President George W. Bush found charred in the fireplace might offer a few clues. Could the killer be the sherry-swilling handyman? The gay antiques dealer with the biting wit? The quarreling newlyweds? Surely it's not Helen D'Arcy, the lovely lass Rex seems to be falling for...  Praise:\"A must for cozy fans.\"\u2014Booklist (starred review) \"Christmas is Murder is a most enjoyable first mystery in what promises to be a fantastic series. Challinor writes with wit and cheek.\"\u2014Rick Miller, host of ABC's prime time hit series Just for Laughs",
