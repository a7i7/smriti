The result is a windfall of new information about language, about learning, and about children themselves.In Language Acquisition Jill and Peter de Villiers provide a lively introduction to this fast-growing field. Their book deals centrally with the way the child acquires the sounds, meanings, and syntax of his language, and the way he learns to use his language to communicate with others. In discussing these issues, the de Villiers provide a clear and insightful treatment of the classic questions about language acquisition: Does the child show a genetic predisposition for speech, or grammar, or semantics which makes him uniquely able to learn human language? What kinds of learning are involved in acquiring language and what kinds of experience with a language are necessary to support such learning? Is there a critical period during the child's development which is optimal for language acquisition? And what kind of psychological disabilities underlie the failure to acquire language?",

        "Title": "Invading Tibet",
        "Authors": "By Frutkin, Mark",
        "Description": "In 1904 a force of 2500 British Imperial troops invaded Tibet. Their mission was to march on the fabled capital of Lhasa and seize its ruler and spiritual head, the Dalai Lama, and compel him to expel foreign provocateurs. All this was but another strategic deployment in the Great Game being played by the major European powers as part of their international one-upmanship and global jousting.The soldiers were accompanied by London journalist Edmund Candler, who reported the experiences of the invaders (and published them in a book afterward: The Unveiling of Lhasa). As Candler notes, the further into the country they march, the odder things get, and the less certain they become of their mission. Tibet seems a cryptic place, full of magic and menace, rocks and snow and natives that look like clay. Most of the time it is as if they, the Westerners, are invading nothing. Tibet seems an awesome emptiness bounded by soaring mountains, yet something is there, awaiting them. But it is more like a rendezvous - an appointment with a metaphysical reality far greater than the Europeans' mechanistic concept.The Tibetan troops who resist are easily dispatched by the invaders' superior weapons, yet it is the English who are unnerved. The fallen defenders do not cry out, they do not weep. The deeper the British trek, the more penetrated and undone the soldiers feel. The commanding officer grows sick and weaker the further they advance, as if he himself were violated by the incursion. Some of the men under his command become contentious, others lust for punitive combat with no quarter given. Yet, as Candler observes, the enemy they most often engage is themselves.Unlike the rest, Candler is enthralled - mesmerized by the extraordinary terrain and events; it is obvious to him that no objective awaits the invasion force in Lhasa, despite what the officers insist. Yet he continues on with them, drawn by the ineffable beauty and mystery of this fabled realm into which they have trekked with their demonstrable superiority and high-minded, self-serving purposes.",

        "Authors": "By (WHISTLER, James McNeill), Freer, Charles Lang, and Merrill, Linda (EDT)",
        "Description": "With Kindest Regards records the extraordinary friendship between the American expatriate artist James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) and his most significant patron, Charles Lang Freer (1854-1919). By the time the industrialist from Detroit met the artist in 1890, Whistler was as notorious for his irascibility as he was famous for his artistic productions. Freer, however, would always maintain that he had never met a truer, nobler man. Their correspondence reveals a warmth and generosity in Whistler that has gone largely unobserved.The eighty-nine letters, telegrams, cablegrams, and calling cards chronicle the growth of Freer's Whistler collection, the largest and most important in the world. Linda Merrill sets the correspondence in context and traces the contacts between the two men during their long acquaintance. She observes how the previously unpublished letters cast new light on Freer's aesthetic education and expand the history of Whistler's later years. Even Freer's outstanding collection of Asian art began with the keen interest in Japanese art he shared with Whistler.Illustrated with works from the Freer collection and vintage photographs from the Freer Gallery Archives, With Kindest Regards makes important original documents accessible for the first time, augments the legends of Whistler's personality, and reveals the foundation of Charles Freer's legacy to the United States.",

Whether investigating a case or a problem of philosophy, the indefatigable Isabel Dalhousie, one of fiction\u2019s most richly developed amateur detectives, is always ready to pursue the answers to all of life\u2019s questions, large and small.With The Sunday Philosophy Club, Alexander McCall Smith, the author of the best-selling and beloved No. 1 Ladies\u2019 Detective Agency novels, begins a wonderful new series starring the irrepressibly curious Isabel Dalhousie.Isabel is fond of problems, and sometimes she becomes interested in problems that are, quite frankly, none of her business. This may be the case when Isabel sees a young man plunge to his death from the upper circle of a concert hall in Edinburgh. Despite the advice of her housekeeper, Grace, who has been raised in the values of traditional Edinburgh, and her niece, Cat, who, if you ask Isabel, is dating the wrong man, Isabel is determined to find the truth\u2013if indeed there is one\u2013behind the man\u2019s death. The resulting moral labyrinth might have stymied even Kant. And then there is the unsatisfactory turn of events in Cat\u2019s love life that must be attended to.Filled with thorny characters and a Scottish atmosphere as thick as a highland mist,The Sunday Philosophy Club is irresistible, and Isabel Dalhousie is the most delightful literary sleuth since Precious Ramotswe.",

When Catherine chose love over churchly devotion by falling in love with her Saxon nobleman, Edgar, her family had the earnest hope that married life would settle this most headstrong and unusual woman. But fate has a way of playing with mortals, and after suffering several miscarriages and the birth of a stillborn child, Catherine is inspired by a prophetic dream. She and Edgar will embark on a pilgrimage to the fabled monastery of Compostela, to petition St. James for a child, to take the holy waters, and to pray. During their journey Catherine and Edgar will encounter mad monks, some less-than-penitent crusaders, and a motley collection of pilgrims whose past deeds bind them all in a bizarre game of chance. When several pilgrims are gruesomely murdered, the trail of evidence points to an old sin left unshriven and a hidden villain whose quest for revenge may end in Catherine's death.",

When the newspaper is filled with stupid features about celebrities at the expense of hard news, the reader feels patronized. In the process, the critical relationship of reader to newspaper is slowly undermined.\"--from NEWS IS A VERBNEWS IS A VERBJournalism at the End of the Twentieth Century\"With the usual honorable exceptions, newspapers are getting dumber. They are increasingly filled with sensation, rumor, press-agent flackery, and bloated trivialities at the expense of significant facts. The Lewinsky affair was just a magnified version of what has been going on for some time. Newspapers emphasize drama and conflict at the expense of analysis. They cover celebrities as if reporters were a bunch of waifs with their noses pressed enviously to the windows of the rich and famous. They are parochial, square, enslaved to the conventional pieties. The worst are becoming brainless printed junk food. All across the country, in large cities and small, even the better newspapers are predictable and boring. I once heard a movie director say of a certain screenwriter: 'He aspired to mediocrity, and he succeeded.' Many newspapers are succeeding in the same way.\"",

        "Authors": "By Fulghum, Robert",
        "Description": "If I was absolutely certain about all things, I would spend my life in anxious misery, fearful of losing my way. But since everything and anything is always possible, the miraculous is always nearby and wonders shall never, ever cease.I believe that human freedom may be stated in one term, which serves as a little brick propping open the door of existence: Maybe.Such is the philosophy that has built Robert Fulghum's All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten, It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It, and Uh-Oh into international bestsellers.His first book of wit and wisdom, All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten, occupied the number one spot on the New York Times bestseller list for some 96 weeks. It was also number one in Ivy paperback, spent 133 weeks on the New York Times list, and has achieved the status of a contemporary classic. It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It, his second book, also soared to instant success, becoming part of publishing history by seizing the New York Times' top hardcover slot while Kindergarten remained a simultaneous hardcover and paperback bestseller. Uh-Oh, another number one bestseller, also reflects on the wonders of everyday life. Fulghum's books radiate a spiritual, yet down-to-earth universality that has made his writing appealing to readers in twenty-four languages; his books are distributed in ninety-three countries.To those modern classics, he now adds Maybe (Maybe Not), his wisest and most entertaining work to date. Opting for constant surprise, he continues to amuse and inspire with enlightenment encountered in the most unexpected ways and places.Consider Fulghum's thoughts on the secret life (that nonstop epic playing inside our heads, where all our best-laid dreams are hatched), on barbershop mythology, the shifting significance of nicknames over the course of a lifetime, or the circumstances of one's own conception. Contemplate along with him the revelations afforded by ironing a shirt, a rousing session of musical chairs, or the ethical struggle to decide a poinsettia's fate; acknowledge that love indeed transcends the ravages of time and that some family secrets can be gifts of joy.Maybe (Maybe Not) is Robert Fulghum at his best: balancing levity and gravity with amazing grace as he makes us a little more aware of the richness and fullness of our lives.",

The two Chinese rulers vying for power - the machiavellian Prime Minister and the ruthless Defense Minister - each seek to manipulate Clark against the other. But whom can he trust? Before he can unravel the final mystery, he must confront some fundamental facts about himself and the mission upon which he was sent. Why did his closest friend, the Secretary of State, really send him to China? Thrust into a deadly web of conspiracy, deceit, and betrayal, Clark races to uncover the truth as the West faces one of the most insidious threats to its security.Pax Pacifica delves brilliantly into the ancient art of Chinese political strategy that, pitted against a Western psychological mind-set, forces Clark to face the shifting realities that are an integral part of this rarely glimpsed realm of high-stakes international diplomacy.",

        "Description": "Beginning with his stunning first novel, A Short History of a Small Place, and in all the books that have followed, T. R. Pearson has created an ever-enlarging fictional realm where laugh-out-loud humor is interwoven with some of mankind's darkest impulses. The result is that seamless tapestry found in all true literature, the human comedy. With his unmistakable colloquial idiom, his hilariously eccentric characters, and the enduring resonance of his tales of fortune and folly, Pearson has given us a world that forever will be fixed in the geography of our imagination.In Cry Me a River, his sixth novel, Pearson writes of murder and its consequences in a small Southern town. When an officer of the law is brutally slain, a fellow cop - one with a particular sensitivity to the darker corners of the human heart - sets out to solve the crime, not at first suspecting that, in his words, \"we were after all, under the surface of things, a community of passionate people who sometimes slaughtered each other for love.\" By the book's end we know who done it and why, but the greatest pleasure lies in Pearson's own investigations into carnal relations, sexual jealousy, men and women, the mean, the low-down, and the dead. That he performs them with such winsome humor and unflagging originality is a tribute to his craft.Cry Me a River is Pearson at his finest. It is also his most accessible novel to date.",
