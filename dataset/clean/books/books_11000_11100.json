Many of the cities of our culture dismiss the Word of God. In What If the Bible Had Never Been Written?, D. James Kennedy and Jerry Newcombe show that this collection of books was indeed the inspiration for almost all of the great explorers, scientists, writers, artists, politicians, and educators the world has ever known. That such a book, which has influenced so many and stood the test of time for so long, is dimissed as folklore or myth,just goes to show what extremes nonbeleivers will go to rationalize their behavoir.From the Ten Commandments, which many of our laws and government are based upon, to the Golden Rule, a verse taken straight out of the New Testament, to many of today's most common phrases and expressions...there is no doubt as to the influence the Bible has on everyone, in some degree, every day. What If the Bible Had Never Been Written? provides a well-documented and in-depth look at the impact the Book of Books has had on humanity, pointing to specfic areas in today's society that would not be as they are now, if it were not for the Bible.",

        "Description": "Nine weeks after losing her husband, Charlotte escapes to a wooden motor yacht in New Hampshire, where her shipmates are an aging blue-haired widow, an emotional seventeen-year-old, and the ugliest dog in literature. A genuine bond develops among the three women, as their distinct personalities and paths cross and converge against the backdrop of emotional secrets, abuse, and the wages of old age.  Off the boat, Charlotte, an archaeologist, joins a local excavation to uncover an ancient graveyard. Here she can indulge her passion for reconstructing the past, even as she tries to bury her own recent history. She comes to realize, however, that the currents of time are as fluid and persistent as the water that drifts beneath her comforting new home.",

Scott Peck,\u00a0\u00a0M.D., offers a needed prescription for our deeply\u00a0\u00a0ailing society. Our illness is\u00a0\u00a0Incivility--morally destructive patterns of\u00a0\u00a0self-absorption, callousness, manipulativeness, and\u00a0\u00a0materialism so ingrained in our routine behavior that we\u00a0\u00a0do not even recognize them. There is a deepening\u00a0\u00a0awareness that something is seriously wrong with\u00a0\u00a0our personal and organizational lives. Using\u00a0\u00a0examples from his own life, case histories, and\u00a0\u00a0dramatic scenarios of businesses that made a conscious\u00a0\u00a0decision to bring civility to their organizations ,\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Peck demonstrates how change can be effected\u00a0\u00a0and how we and our organizations can be restored to\u00a0\u00a0health. This wise, practical, and radical book is\u00a0\u00a0a blueprint for achieving personal and societal\u00a0\u00a0well-being.",

Today, the near-bride, Adele Dobbin, and her two sisters, Lois and Kathleen, blame Harvey for what unkind relatives call their spinsterhood, and what potential beaus might characterize as a leery, united front. The doorbell rings one cold April night. Harvey Nash, older, filled with regrets (sort of), more charming and arousable than ever, just in from the Coast, where he's reinvented himself as Nash Harvey, jingle composer and chronic bachelor, has returned to the scene of his first romantic crime. Despite the sisters' scars and grudges, despite his platinum tongue and roving eye, this old flame becomes an improbable catalyst for the untried and the long overdue.????????The refined and level-headed Adele finds herself flirting with her boss--on public television. Entrepreneurial Kathleen is suddenly drinking cappuccino with Lorenz, the handsome doorman at the luxury high-rise where she owns a lingerie boutique. And Lois, the only sister to have embarked on the road to matrimony and, subsequently, divorce, revives her long-cherished notion that Harvey abandoned Adele rather than indulge his preference for another Dobbin.????????Both comic and compassionate, The Ladies' Man has all of Lipman's trademark wit, wattage, and social mischief--with an extra bite.",

By daring to enlarge her neighbors' lives, she crosses Mrs. Gamart, the local arts doyenne. Florence's warehouse leaks, her cellar seeps, and the shop is apparently haunted. Only too late does she begin to suspect the truth: a town that lacks a bookshop isn't always a town that wants one.",

Scholars, students, and general readers of all ages have wondered\u2014for centuries\u2014about whether Britain was ever really ruled by an Arthur who held court at a place called Camelot. In this book, the distinguished scholar Geoffrey Ashe offers convincing proof that King Arthur not only existed, but was more like the Arthur of legend than historians have previously suspected.In this exciting study, drawing upon myriad sources both literary and historical, Ashe traces the legend of King Arthur to its roots in the twelfth-century chronicles of Geoffrey of Monmouth. He then illustrates that a great deal of Geoffrey's history, which set out ot depict events and persons of fifth-century Britain, was based on fact. After challenging previous assumptions about where Arthur's court and other remnants can be found, Ashe identifies thereal King Arthur and provides powerful evidence to support his theory.Riothamus, an actual fifth-century British monarch, is the figure whom Ashe painstakingly identifies. But his study also investigates the histories behind other Arthurian phenomena, such as the key concepts of knighthood and chivalry. Throughout the book, the swep and grandeur of a tumultuous era in British and European history is vividly recounted as Ashe describes the origins and development of the Arthurian legend\u2014a legend that seems to grow ever more enchanting and spellbinding.Myths, legends, and literary mysteries mix with maps, relics, and historical facts inThe Discovery of King Arthur.

        "Authors": "By Perry, Paul and Brinkley, Dannion",
        "Description": "On September 17, 1975, Dannion Brinkley was talking on the phone during a thunderstorm. A bolt of lightning hit the phone line, sending thousands of volts of electricity into his head and down his body, throwing him several feet into the air. His heart stopped, and he died.When Brinkley revived in the morgue after twenty-eight minutes, he had an incredible story to tell. Saved by the Light is the profoundly moving personal account of his near-death experiences - the second NDE occurring fourteen years later - and the resulting spiritual transformation that has completely altered his life.After the lightning strike, Brinkley watched from above as loved ones and medics tried to start his heart. When doctors pronounced him dead he was already traveling through a dark tunnel toward a spirit being, who led him into a crystal city awash in light and tranquillity. Brought before thirteen angelic instructors in what he describes as \"a cathedral of knowledge,\" Brinkley was told of events that would shake the world before the year 2000 - including the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the Persian Gulf War, and America's current economic crisis. Of the 117 revelations that he recalls, 95 have already come to pass.During his long, painful convalescence, Brinkley not only revisited the spiritual advisers in his dreams but also discovered that he had developed the ability to read minds. Neither the medical establishment nor religious institutions truly believed his story or could offer help. Finally Brinkley connected with others who had had near-death experiences through Dr. Raymond Moody, author of Life After Life and Reunions and a foremost researcher in the field of NDEs. Moody was astounded by the complexity and detail of Brinkley's story.Brinkley's second NDE occurred in 1989, when his damaged heart gave out during an attack of pneumonia. Again he traveled to the crystal city, where he was reunited with his angelic instructors, and learned he was to use his new psychic and spiritual gifts to aid the dying and the desperate. He has since devoted his life to working with the sick and the elderly and to bringing the revelations he received to people around the world.Now he has written his story to inspire people everywhere. Filled with drama, excitement, and a boundless enthusiasm for life and its mysteries, Saved by the Light is a classic in its field.",

        "Description": "Love and survival. What do they have to do with each other?This book is based on a simple but powerful idea: Our survival depends on the healing power of love, intimacy and relationships. As individuals. As communities. As a country. As a culture. Perhaps even as a species.For the past 20 years, Dean Ornish, M.D., has directed clinical research, demonstrating -- for the first time -- that comprehensive lifestyle changes may begin to reverse severe coronary heart disease without drugs or surgery. Now, this \"impossible\" idea has become mainstream.Although most people tend to think of Dr. Ornish&#39;s program as being primarily about diet, he has found that perhaps the most powerful and meaningful intervention is love and intimacy and the emotional and spiritual transformation that often results. Yet those factors are largely ignored by the medical profession, which tends to focus primarily on the physical and mechanistic: drugs and surgery, genes and germs, microbes and molecules.Dr. Ornish is a pioneer once more as he persuasively argues that love and intimacy are a root of what makes us sick and what makes us well, what causes sadness and what brings happiness, what makes us suffer and what leads to healing.  If a new drug had that same impact, virtually every doctor in the country would be recommending it for their patients.There is a deep spiritual hunger in this country as we approach the end of the 20th century and a new millenium. According to Dr. Ornish, the real epidemic in our culture is what he calls emotional and spiritual heart disease, the profound sense of loneliness, isolation, alienation and depression that is so prevalent today as the social structures that used to provide us with a sense of connection and community break down. We are only now beginning to appreciate what the radical shifts in our society in the past 50 years really mean.Love and Survival also chronicles Dr. Ornish&#39;s personal journey along with his experiences as a physician and scientist. He also provides a comprehensive review of research supporting the powerful role of intimacy in health and illness, reveals in very personal terms his own struggles with intimacy and meaning and describes strategies and techniques for enhancing intimacy and communication. Love and Survival\u00a0is filled with powerful stories from Dr. Ornish&#39;s clinical and personal experiences. He takes his examination a step further by talking with eminent healers, scientists, theologians, psychologists, physicians, therapists and authors, each of whom provides a fascinating perspective on why love and intimacy are such powerful determinants of health and survival. In addition, Dr. Ornish&#39;s photographs, reflecting isolation and connection, illustrate the book.",

If you're Camille Delonga, you fight the urge to go lie down for a year or so ... and then you do what any self-respecting mother of the bride would -- you march right out and buy a sky-high stack of bridal magazines. Once upon a Wedding In award-winning author Kathleen Eagle's astonishing and warm new novel, we see just what happens to Camille, her family, and her friends when her beautiful and young daughter, Jordan, speaks those unforgettable words. After all, weddings are a time of unbelievable joy, a few tender tears -- and sometimes one huge headache. So Camille ignores the thought that her baby is simply too young to take such a big step and throws herself into action. There are flower arrangements to be chosen, favors to be lovingly created by her own two hands ... and lives to be put in order. And one of those disorganized lives belongs to her irrepressible, irresponsible, and somehow still irresistibleex-husband.  When they were younger -- as young as Jordan is now -- Camille loved Creed Burke with all her heart and soul. This passionate Lakota swept her off her feet and right to the justice of the peace. Their wedding had been hurried, private ... nothing like the extravaganza their daughter is now planning.Creed is a musician who never seems to stay in one place long enough. Yet his wanderlust has never quite quenched his and Camille's passion for each other or his love for their daughter.  But it did unravel their marriage. Now after years of cordial and casual, Camille finds that Creed is invading every aspect of her life. When she comes down for breakfast, he's sitting at the table helping himself to coffee. And when she goes out on the town with her girlfriends, he's sure to show up and ask her for a long, slow dance.  Slowly but surely, Creed is weaving himself back into the fabric of her life. And their daughter's upcoming wedding brings back so many tender, tempting, and confusing memories of their own fiery union.Her two best girlfriends aren't much help.  \"Maybe it'll all work out,\" says gentle Ellie, a not-so-closet romantic who is clearly hoping for a reconciliation. \"Don't trust him!\" warns Bridget. But can you really trust someone whose husband has just stormed out of the house? As for Camille's own mother, Rosie, who is facing a serious illness and still has an expectant gleam in her eye and a soft spot in her heart for her ex-son-in-law, she declares Life's too short to pass up another shot at happiness.So when the big day arrives Camille realizes there is only one answer: follow her heart. But where will it take her?Kathleen Eagle has written an extraordinary story, filled with the complexity of female friendships, the tempestousness of the mother-daughter relationship, and the power of everlasting love. Anyone who has ever been a mother, daughter, friend, or lover will never forget Once upon a Wedding.",

In the course of a career filled with violence and passion, Claude learns the arts of enameling and watchmaking from an irascible, defrocked abb\u00e9, apprentices himself to a pornographic bookseller, and applies his erotic erudition to the seduction of the wife of an impotent wigmaker. But it is Claude's greatest device-a talking mechanical head-that both crowns his career and leads to an execution as tragic as that of Marie Antoinette, and far more bizarre.Hailed by critics for the shimmering brilliance of its inventions and its uncanny fidelity to the textures of the past, A Case of Curiosities places Allen Kurzweil securely in the ranks of the finest literary artists of our time.",

        "Title": "The Best American Science Writing 2002 (Best American Science Writing)",
        "Authors": "By Cohen, Jesse (EDT) and Ridley, Matt (EDT)",
        "Description": "If, as Matt Ridley suggests, science is simply the search for new forms of ignorance, then perhaps it follows that with science's advances come new questions. Will human genetic engineering become commonplace? Will human cloning ever be safe? Are there many universes? How much will the climate change during the coming century?The Best American Science Writing 2002 gathers top writers and scientists covering the latest developments in the fastest-changing, farthest-reaching scientific fields, such as medicine, genetics, computer technology, evolutionary psychology, cutting-edge physics, and the environment. Among this year's selections: In \"The Made-to-Order Savior,\" Lisa Belkin spotlights two desperate families seeking an unprecedented cure by a medically and ethically unprecedented means -- creating a genetically matched child. Margaret Talbot's \"A Desire to Duplicate\" reveals that the first human clone may very likely come from an entirely unexpected source, and sooner than we think. Michael Specter reports on the shock waves rippling through the field of neuroscience following the revolutionary discovery that adult brain cells might in fact regenerate (\"Rethinking the Brain\"). Christopher Dickey's \"I Love My Glow Bunny\" recounts with sly humor a peculiar episode in which genetic engineering and artistic culture collide. Natalie Angier draws an insightful contrast between suicide terrorists and rescue workers who risk their lives, and finds that sympathy and altruism have a definite place in the evolution of human nature, David Berlinski's \"What Brings a World into Being?\" ponders the idea of biology and physics as essentially digital technologies, exploring the mysteries encoded in the universe's smallest units, be they cells or quanta. Nicholas Wade shows how one of the most controversial books of the year, The Skeptical Environmentalist, by former Greenpeace member and self-described leftist Bjorn Lomborg, debunks some of the most cherished tenets of the environmental movement, suggesting that things are perhaps not as bad as we've been led to believe. And as a counterpoint, Darcy Frey's profile of George Divoky reveals a dedicated researcher whose love of birds and mystery leads to some sobering discoveries about global warming and forcefully reminds us of the unsung heroes of science: those who put in long hours, fill in small details, and take great trouble.In the end, the unanswered questions are what sustain scientific inquiry, open new frontiers of knowledge, and lead to new technologies and medical treatments. The Best American Science Writing 2002 is a series of exciting reports from science's front lines, where what we don't know is every bit as important as what we know.",
