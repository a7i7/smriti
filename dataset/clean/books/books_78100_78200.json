        "Description": "For courses in world regional geography. Conceptual Exploration of World Regions and the Myriad Issues Critical to Geography TodayWorld Regions in Global Context presents a strong global sensibility and an emphasis on current events, with examples of interdependent development, spatial and social inequality, and questions of spatial justice. The authors maintain that regions are the outcomes of the twin forces of globalization and regionalization. Therefore, each regional chapter stresses the global systems of connection that drive unique regional processes, making regions different. By studying regions, students not only learn the critical elements of different places, but also come to understand the fundamental processes that drive change.\u00a0The Sixth Edition is a briefer, more visual text that still maintains its conceptual rigor by addressing today\u2019s critical geographic themes, incorporating deeper focus on sustainability issues, new human stories from the regions, cutting-edge data visualizations and infographics, including a completely modernized cartography program, and much more.Also Available with MasteringGeographyTM This title is also available with MasteringGeography\u2013an online homework, tutorial, and assessment program designed to work with this text to engage students and improve results.

        "Description": "Augusten Burroughs, David Sedaris, and David Rakoff have all produced winning memoirs of their demented,   alternately heartrending and sidesplitting late- twentieth-century American childhoods.  Now, first-time author Eric   Poole joins their ranks with his chronicle of a childhood gone hilariously and heartbreakingly awry in the Midwest of   the 1970s.  From the age of eight through early adolescence, Poole sought refuge from his obsessive-compulsive   mother, sadistic teachers, and sneering schoolyard thugs in the Scotchgarded basement of his family's suburban St.   Louis tract house. There, emulating his favorite TV character, Endora from Bewitched, he wrapped himself   in a makeshift caftan and cast magical spells in an effort to maintain control over the rapidly shifting ground   beneath his feet. But when a series of tragic events tested Eric's longstanding belief that magic can vanquish evil, he   began to question the efficacy of his incantations, embarking on a spiritual journey that led him to discover the   magic that comes only from within.

        "Title": "Pearl Buck in China: Journey to The Good Earth",
        "Authors": "By Spurling, Hilary",
        "Description": "\"Pearl Buck is one of the greatest writers on China, and Hilary Spurling has brought her and the China of her time to life with amazing immediacy and perception.\"---Jung Chang, Author of Wild Swans\"Hilary Spurling has given us a riveting, multidimensional portrait of a writer torn between her Chinese childhood and her American roots. Haunting, yet firmly rooted in Chinese history, Pearl Buck in China shows the real Pearl Buck behind the well-known iconic image.\"---Hannah Pakula, Author of The Last Empress\"A compelling study of a woman who tried to make sense of the poverty, violence, and suffering she saw as a child in rural China by setting down everything that happened to her, stripping away both the lies of her family and society in her search for self-identity and truth. Spurling's penetrating insight and virtuoso style create a fascinating portrait of an author's coming of age.\"---Jennet Conant, Author of Tuxedo Park and the Irregulars\"Boldly conceived and magnificently written, original, enlightening, and with a narrative as thrilling as an epic film, Pearl Buck in China is a triumphant landmark in the development of creative biography.\"---Elaine Showalter, Author of a Jury of her Peers\"From its wonderful opening sentence to its poignant close, this is a superb biography. Spurling has brought her characters to robust life. Readers will learn what they need to know about China in that tumultuous time and place at the beginning of the twentieth century.\"---Peter Conn, Vartan Gregorian Professor of English, University of Pennsylvania, and Author of Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography\"Hilary Spurling's riveting biography should bring Buck and her work back to the forefront of public consciousness as China once again looms large in our political and cultural lives. A marvelous book.\"---Erica Wagner, Literary Editor of The Times (London) and Author of Ariel's GiftOne of the Twentieth century's most extraordinary Americans, Pearl Buck was the First Person to Make China Accessible to the West. She recreated the lives of ordinary Chinese people in The Good Earth, an overnight worldwide bestseller in 1932, later a blockbuster movie. Buck went on to become the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Long before anyone else, she foresaw China's future as a superpower, and she recognized the crucial importance for both countries of China's building a relationship with the United States. As a teenager she had witnessed the first stirrings of Chinese revolution, and as a young woman she narrowly escaped being killed in the deadly struggle between Chinese Nationalists and the newly formed Communist Party.Pearl grew up in an imperial China unchanged for thousands of years. She was the child of American missionaries, but she spoke Chinese before she learned English, and her friends were the children of Chinese farmers. She took it for granted that she was Chinese herself until she was eight years old, when the terrorist uprising known as the Boxer Rebellion forced her family to flee for their lives. It was the first of many desperate flights. Flood, famine, drought, bandits, and war formed the background of Pearl's life in China. \"Asia was the real, the actual world,\" she said, \"and my own country became the dreamworld.\"Pearl wrote about the realities of the only world she knew in The Good Earth. It was one of the last things she did before being finally forced out of China to settle for the first time in the United States. She was unknown and penniless with a failed marriage behind her, a disabled child to support, no prospects, and no way of telling that The Good Earth would sell tens of millions of copies. It transfixed a whole generation of readers just as Jung Chang's Wild Swans would do more than half a century later. No Westerner had ever written anything like this before, and no Chinese had either.Buck was the forerunner of a wave of Chinese Americans from Maxine Hong Kingston to Amy Tan. Until their books began coming out in the last few decades, her novels were unique in that they spoke for ordinary Asian people---\"translating my parents to me,\" said Hong Kingston, \"and giving me our ancestry and our habitation.\" As a phenomenally successful writer and civil-rights campaigner, Buck did more than anyone else in her lifetime to change Western perceptions of China. In a world with its eyes trained on China today, she has much to tell us about what lies behind its astonishing reawakening.",

        "Title": "Horse Soldiers: The Extraordinary Story of a Band of US Soldiers Who Rode to Victory in Afghanistan",
        "Authors": "By Stanton, Doug",
        "Description": "The inspiration for the major motion picture 12 Strong from Jerry Bruckheimer, starring Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon. From the New York Times bestselling author of In Harm\u2019s Way comes a true-life story of American soldiers overcoming great odds to achieve a stunning military victory.Horse Soldiers is the dramatic account of a small band of Special Forces soldiers who secretly entered Afghanistan following 9/11 and rode to war on horses against the Taliban. Outnumbered forty to one, they pursued the enemy army across the mountainous Afghanistan terrain and, after a series of intense battles, captured the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which was strategically essential to defeat their opponent throughout the country. The bone-weary American soldiers were welcomed as liberators as they rode into the city, and the streets thronged with Afghans overjoyed that the Taliban regime had been overthrown. Then the action took a wholly unexpected turn. During a surrender of six hundred Taliban troops, the Horse Soldiers were ambushed by the would-be POWs. Dangerously overpowered, they fought for their lives in the city\u2019s immense fortress, Qala-i-Janghi, or the House of War. At risk were the military gains of the entire campaign: if the soldiers perished or were captured, the entire effort to outmaneuver the Taliban was likely doomed. Deeply researched and beautifully written, Stanton\u2019s account of the Americans\u2019 quest to liberate an oppressed people touches the mythic. The soldiers on horses combined ancient strategies of cavalry warfare with twenty-first-century aerial bombardment technology to perform a seemingly impossible feat. Moreover, their careful effort to win the hearts of local townspeople proved a valuable lesson for America\u2019s ongoing efforts in Afghanistan.",

        "Description": "In this candid and compelling memoir, the first lady of South Carolina reveals the private ordeal behind her very public betrayal\u2014and offers inspiration for anyone struggling to keep faith during life\u2019s most trying times.She\u2019s been a successful investment banker, a mother of four, and the campaign manager for one of American politics\u2019 rising stars\u2014her husband, Mark Sanford of South Carolina, once widely hailed as a possible candidate for president in 2012. Yet to most Americans, Jenny Sanford is best known for the one role she refused to play\u2014that of conventional political spouse standing silently by while her husband went before the media and confessed his infidelity. Instead, she stayed true\u2014to herself, to her faith, and to her highest ideals of parenthood and public service. She chose to let Mark Sanford deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character, even in the face of the lies their father has told. In Staying True, Jenny Sanford recalls her shock and anguish upon discovering that her husband was having an affair with a woman in Argentina, and the further pain when she learned\u2014just a day ahead of most Americans\u2014that he had not ended the affair when she believed he had. She reveals the source of her determination to be honest and forthright instead of the victim in the tabloid passion play that gripped the nation in June 2009.\u00a0But her story neither begins nor ends with Mark Sanford\u2019s astounding fall from grace. Writing with uncommon candor from a deep well of spiritual strength, Sanford shares personal stories and life lessons from before and after she stepped into the public realm. She recounts the many stresses\u2014as well as the myriad joys\u2014that she experienced on a daily basis while living in the governmental spotlight. (Just try keeping four young boys out of mischief in the governor\u2019s mansion!) And she describes the many ways that the seductions of power can drive apart even the most committed couples.At every step along her journey, Jenny Sanford has made choices: She gave up her career, moved far from her home state of Illinois, even changed her religious practices. Every choice was a glad concession to harmonious married life and, in some cases, to the support of her husband\u2019s political aspirations. But the one thing she never gave up was her sense of self, her inner moral compass. Her remarkable poise and decency make her a role model for men and women alike. Her story will empower anyone who has fought to maintain independence and integrity\u2014within a marriage or elsewhere in life.",

        "Title": "Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy",
        "Authors": "By Stiglitz, Joseph E.",
        "Description": "The Great Recession, as it has come to be called, has impacted more people worldwide than any crisis since the Great Depression. Flawed government policy and unscrupulous personal and corporate behavior in the United States created the current financial meltdown, which was exported across the globe with devastating consequences. The crisis has sparked an essential debate about America\u2019s economic missteps, the soundness of this country\u2019s economy, and even the appropriate shape of a capitalist system.Few are more qualified to comment during this turbulent time than Joseph E. Stiglitz. Winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics, Stiglitz is \u201can insanely great economist, in ways you can\u2019t really appreciate unless you\u2019re deep into the field\u201d (Paul Krugman, New York Times). In Freefall, Stiglitz traces the origins of the Great Recession, eschewing easy answers and demolishing the contention that America needs more billion-dollar bailouts and free passes to those \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d while also outlining the alternatives and revealing that even now there are choices ahead that can make a difference. The system is broken, and we can only fix it by examining the underlying theories that have led us into this new \u201cbubble capitalism.\u201dRanging across a host of topics that bear on the crisis, Stiglitz argues convincingly for a restoration of the balance between government and markets. America as a nation faces huge challenges\u2014in health care, energy, the environment, education, and manufacturing\u2014and Stiglitz penetratingly addresses each in light of the newly emerging global economic order. An ongoing war of ideas over the most effective type of capitalist system, as well as a rebalancing of global economic power, is shaping that order. The battle may finally give the lie to theories of a \u201crational\u201d market or to the view that America\u2019s global economic dominance is inevitable and unassailable.For anyone watching with indignation while a reckless Wall Street destroyed homes, educations, and jobs; while the government took half-steps hoping for a \u201cjust-enough\u201d recovery; and while bankers fell all over themselves claiming not to have seen what was coming, then sought government bailouts while resisting regulation that would make future crises less likely, Freefall offers a clear accounting of why so many Americans feel disillusioned today and how we can realize a prosperous economy and a moral society for the future.",

        "Authors": "By Thomas, Helen and Crawford, Craig",
        "Description": "Helen Thomas has covered the administrations of ten presidents in a career spanning nearly sixty years. She is known for her famous press conference closing line, \"Thank you, Mr. President,\" but here she trades deference for directness. Thomas and veteran journalist Craig Crawford hold nothing back as they use former occupants of the White House to provide a witty, history-rich lesson plan of what it takes to be a good president.   Combining sharp observation and dozens of examples from the fi rst presidency through the forty-fourth, the authors outline the qualities, attitudes, and political and personal choices that make for the most successful leaders, and the least. Calvin Coolidge, who hired the fi rst professional speechwriter in the White House, illuminates the importance of choosing words wisely. William Howard Taft, notorious for being so fat he broke his White House bathtub, shows how not to cultivate a strong public image. John F. Kennedy, who could handle the press corps and their questions with aplomb, shows how to establish a rapport with the press and open oneself up to the public. Ronald Reagan, who acknowledged the Iran-Contra affair in a television address, demonstrates how telling hard truths can earn forgiveness and even public trust.   By gleaning lessons from past leaders, Thomas and Crawford not only highlight those that future presidents should follow but also pinpoint what Americans should look for and expect in their president. Part history lesson, part presidential primer, Listen Up, Mr. President is smart, entertaining, and exceedingly edifying.",

        "Authors": "By Branson, Richard",
        "Description": "\"Oh, screw it, let's do it.\"That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard Branson, in slightly more than twenty-five years, to spawn so many successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that \"since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin.\" Since then, Branson has written his own \"rules\" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, \"Don't do it.\" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories: Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globeSigning the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil CollinsFighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishmentSwimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of MexicoSelling Virgin Records to save Virgin AtlanticStaging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .And much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.Also available in the UK from Virgin Publishing, and in Canada from General Publishing,From the Hardcover edition.",

While some have tended to view asset class mispricings as mere  \u201cnoise,\u201d this compelling book shows why they are  important signals of opportunities and risks that will shape the market for years to come. One of today's most respected names in finance, Mohamed El-Erian puts recent events in their proper context, giving you the tools that can help you interpret the markets, benefit from global economic change, and navigate the risks. The world economy is in the midst of a series of hand-offs. Global growth is now being heavily influenced by nations that previously had little or no systemic influence. Former debtor nations are building unforeseen wealth and, thus, enjoying unprecedented influence and facing unusual challenges. And new derivative products have changed the behavior of many market segments and players. Yet, despite all these changes, the system's infrastructure is yet to be upgraded to reflect the realities of today's and tomorrow's world. El-Erian investigates the underlying drivers of global change to shed light on how you should: Think about the new opportunities and risksConstruct an appropriately diversified and internationalized portfolioProtect your portfolio against new sources of systemic riskBest think about the impact of central banks and financial policies around the world Offering up predictions of future developments, El-Erian directs his focus to help you capitalize on the new financial landscape, while limiting exposure to new risk configurations. When Markets Collide is a unique collection of books for investors and policy makers around the world. In addition to providing a thorough analysis and clear perspective of recent events, it lays down a detailed map for navigating your way through an otherwise perplexing new economic landscape.",

Josey Cirrini is sure of three things:  winter is her favorite season, she\u2019s a sorry excuse for a Southern belle, and sweets  are best eaten in the privacy of her closet. For while Josey has settled into an  uneventful life in her mother\u2019s house, her one consolation is the stockpile of sugary  treats and paperback romances she escapes to each night. . . . Until she finds her closet  harboring Della Lee Baker, a local waitress who is one part nemesis\u2014and two parts  fairy godmother. With Della Lee\u2019s tough love, Josey\u2019s narrow existence quickly expands.  She even bonds with Chloe Finley, a young woman who is hounded by books that inexplicably  appear when she needs them\u2014and who has a close connection to Josey\u2019s longtime crush.

        "Title": "Impatient with Desire",
        "Authors": "By Burton, Gabrielle",
        "Description": "A great adventure.A haunting tragedy.An enduring love.In the spring of 1846, Tamsen Donner, her husband, George, their five daughters, and eighty other pioneers headed to California on the California-Oregon Trail in eager anticipation of new lives out West. Everything that could go wrong did, and an American legend was born.The Donner Party. We think we know their story--pioneers trapped in the mountains performing an unspeakable act to survive--but we know only that one harrowing part of it. Impatient with Desire brings us answers to the unanswerable question: What really happened in the four months the Donners were trapped in the mountains And it brings to stunning life a woman--and a love story--behind the myth.Tamsen Eustis Donner, born in 1801, taught school, wrote poetry, painted, botanized, and was fluent in French. At twenty-three, she sailed alone from Massachusetts to North Carolina when respectable women didn't travel alone. Years after losing her first husband, Tully, she married again for love, this time to George Donner, a prosperous farmer, and in 1846, they set out for California with their five youngest children. Unlike many women who embarked reluctantly on the Oregon Trail, Tamsen was eager to go. Later, trapped in the mountains by early snows, she had plenty of time to contemplate the wisdom of her decision and the cost of her wanderlust.Historians have long known that Tamsen kept a journal, though it was never found. In Impatient with Desire, Burton draws on years of historical research to vividly imagine this lost journal--and paints a picture of a remarkable heroine in an extraordinary situation. Tamsen's unforgettable journey takes us from the cornfields of Illinois to the dusty Oregon Trail to the freezing Sierra Nevada Mountains, where she was forced to confront an impossible choice.Impatient with Desire is a passionate, heart-wrenching story of courage, hope, and love in hardship, all told at a breathless pace. Intimate in tone and epic in scope, Impatient with Desire is absolutely hypnotic.Praise for Impatient with Desire\"Gabrielle Burton brings us a moving story of human courage and frailty. Tamsen Donner's tale will stay with you long after you've read the last page.\"--Nancy Horan, author of Loving Frank\"Few figures in the westward movement of this country have the almost mythic presence of Tamsen Donner. With her strong creative gifts, an exceptional talent for clear and moving narrative, and careful research, Burton has most surely succeeded in her intention to capture Tamsen Donner's spirit and has given us a marvelous, moving story of a brave, loving--and real--woman.\"--Isabel Zuber, author of Salt\"Told through fictional letters and diary entries written by Tamsen Donner, Impatient with Desire is a hauntingly lyrical story of the ill-fated Donner Party, one of the seminal events in America's westward movement. This bittersweet novel of love and sacrifice will tear at your heart.\"--Sandra Dallas, author of Prayers for Sale",

The line from the song goes, `you can have all this world, but give me Jesus. `This book does just that.\"---Reggie McNeal, Missional Leadership Specialist, Leadership Network Author, The Present Future and Missional RenaissanceChristians have made the gospel about so many things---things other than Christ. Religious concepts, ideas, doctrines, strategies, methods, techniques, and formulas have all eclipsed the beauty, the glory, and the reality of the Lord Jesus Himself. On the whole, Christians today are starved for a real experience of the living Christ. We know a lot about our Lord, but we don't know Him very well. We know a lot about trying to be like Jesus, but very little about living by His indwelling life.Jesus Manifesto presents a fresh unveiling of Jesus as not only Savior and Lord, but as so much more. It is a prophetic call to restore the supremacy and sovereignty of Christ in a world---and a church---that has lost sight of Him.Every revival and restoration in the church has been a rediscovery of some aspect of Christ in the process of answering the ultimate question that Jesus put to His disciples:\"Who do you say that I am?\"Read this book and see your Lord like you've never seen Him before.",

The Daily Five is a series of literacy tasks (reading to self, reading with someone, writing, word work, and listening to reading) which students complete daily while the teacher meets with small groups or confers with individuals.This book not only explains the philosophy behind the structure, but shows you how to carefully and systematically train your students to participate in each of the five components.Explicit modeling practice, reflecting and refining take place during the launching phase, preparing the foundation for a year of meaningful content instruction tailored to meet the needs of each child.The Daily Five is more than a management system or a curriculum framework; it is a structure that will help students develop the habits that lead to a lifetime of independent literacy.",

Lady Elizabeth, the youngest and most headstrong of the three Banning sisters, has been engaged three times, and has most scandalously broken off all three engagements. Her fear of becoming any man\u2019s property has kept her from marriage and earned her a reputation in the ton as a heartbreaking flirt. Neil Severin is a wicked rogue, black of heart and black of reputation. A man of no morals, devoid of compassion, he is a governmentsanctioned assassin. And his newest target is a man Beth holds dear. When the flame-haired beauty thwarts his plan, Neil exacts his own brand of spicy revenge. Beth despises him. Neil doesn\u2019t care. But circumstances most unexpectedly throw them together, and with Beth\u2019s life in danger, Neil finds himself in the unexpected role of hero, racing to save her before it\u2019s too late.

        "Description": "Nearly 60 percent of American households today consist of only one or two people, yet most cookbooks don\u2019t reflect this trend, with recipes designed for large families, yielding 6-8 servings. For individuals and small families who want to cook hearty, healthful meals but don\u2019t want to deal with all the leftovers, Beth Hensperger has the solution. The James Beard Award\u2013winning author follows up the best-selling Not Your Mother\u2019s\u00ae Slow Cooker Cookbook with Not Your Mother\u2019s\u00ae Slow Cooker Recipes for Two, a collection of 125 new recipes specially designed for the small slow cooker. As always, Hensperger\u2019s innovative recipes call for fresh, healthful ingredients and continue to prove that the slow cooker can produce amazing meals. While the recipes yield the perfect amount for two or three people, there is no shortage of flavor with dishes such as Quick Hominy and Zucchini Chili, Moroccan-Spiced Tomato Chicken with Almonds, Lamb Stew with Lemon and Garlic, and Vegetable Polenta with Mascarpone Cheese. The slow cooker is an essential countertop appliance for busy cooks, and this is the only book on the market specifically written for the increasingly popular 1 \u00bd- 3 \u00bd-quart slow cooker. Not Your Mother\u2019s\u00ae Slow Cooker Recipes for Two is great for the growing population of empty-nesters, working couples, singles, and small families who want the convenience of small slow-cooker cooking without sacrificing wholesomeness and flavor.",

        "Description": "The middle class, where the greatness of this nation is rooted, is under siege by an increasingly unethical system, managed by economic vampires who are sucking the lifeblood out of the American family and ripping the heart out of democracy itself. Big money-and the politicians who are swayed by it-play both parties against each other, using this false battle to distract most of us from the real war, which is a war against the American family.This is it, folks . . . the moment of truth. This will be the moment historians will look back upon and either say it was the moment this great ship of state corrected its course, or the moment it sailed completely away from its democratic ideals.To succeed, we have to reach back and rediscover our greatness. Progress may not come as fast as we, in our impatience and impertinence, demand. But if we are patient and persistent, it will come.All good things in life require a heavy lift, so roll up your sleeves. We are not done yet.--from Killer PoliticsAccording to a 2008 Pew Report, more than half of all Americans self-identify as middle class--but the actual number of Americans with middle-class incomes is declining. The middle class is going away. As increasing numbers of Americans are faced with obstacles to education, health care, jobs, and equity, the middle class as a financial bracket is being replaced by the middle class as little more than a state of mind. The richest Americans are growing exponentially wealthier, while the rest of us struggle to bear the financial and emotional burdens of an increasingly broken system.In Killer Politics, Ed Schultz pulls the wool back from our eyes, shows us what the state of the middle class really is, and gives us the tools we need to fight back.",

We begin to see ourselves as alone, isolated, or at odds with the rest of the universe. How can we learn to live in relationship in a more enlightened way?  In US: Transforming Ourselves and the Relationships That Matter Most, Lisa Oz, the bestselling coauthor of the YOU: The Owner\u2019s Manual series, takes readers on a transformational journey as she explores the three relationships that matter most: with the self, with others, and with the Divine. Interrelated and inseparable, these fundamental relationships determine the quality and the measure of our emotional and spiritual lives.  Drawing from ancient traditions, spiritual and holistic thinkers, and personal insights, Lisa Oz guides you on an engaging, thought-provoking, and ultimately inspirational path toward changing your self, your relationships, and your life. With remarkable candor and humor, Lisa offers personal anecdotes that highlight the truth and consequences of familiar interactions.

Lisa\u2019s writing on topics such as personal well-being, identifying your authentic self, conscious parenting, marital bonding, and truly compassionate living are persuasive because they are suggestive rather than prescriptive.

Kennedy\u2019s assassination. 9/11. John Hagee maintains that these American tragedies all have one element in common: they were unthinkable. And in the opening pages of his newest book, Can America Survive? Hagee uses these tragedies to prove two points: that the unthinkable can happen and, given the right conditions, the unthinkable can quickly become the inevitable.\u00a0In Can America Survive? Hagee asserts that the seeds for tragedy are once again being sown, evidenced by the disturbing economic, geopolitical, and religious trends that now threaten to dismantle the very nation itself. \u201cThink it can\u2019t happen?\u201d Hagee asks in a theme repeated throughout the book. \u201cThink again.\u201d Indeed, Hagee presents alarming examples of recent events, current research, scientific evidence, and biblical prophecy that are gathering to create a \u201cperfect storm\u201d that could bring down the \u201cunsinkable\u201d United States of America including:  The U.S.\u2019s negligent handling of Israel, and history\u2019s evidence of the danger to any nation that challenges Israel\u2019s God-mandated right to exist The dangerous belittling of Iran\u2019s nuclear threat by careless spy agencies\u2014and the super-weapon that could stop the U.S. in its tracks instantly The chilling biblical prophecy that confirms Iran as one of six countries that will form an Islamic military force \u201cas a cloud to cover the land\u201d The real $2.5 trillion price tag of healthcare reform, the international currency shifts, and the national economic trends that are poised to bring about the death of the American dollar The criminalization of Christianity around the world;Can America Survive? is not just a warning. It is a wake-up call and a rallying cry to Christian citizens everywhere to prevent the next unthinkable American disaster. After all, as Hagee points out, \u201cthose who do not remember the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them in the future.\u201d Think it can\u2019t happen? Think again.",
