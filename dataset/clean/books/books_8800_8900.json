        "Description": "\"In the past three years,\" as the authors of this book write, \"the frontier of the accelerating late industrial revolution has moved beyond Japan to the rest of East and Southeast Asia. The economic take-off of this region...is of historic significance for several reasons: The pace of economic and social change is faster than for any previous area or era.... With 1.8 billion people, the countries of Pacific Asia are much more populous than the original core areas.... In the developing countries of Pacific Asia, modernization is taking place in societies which have long historical traditions and cultures quite different from those of the West.\"The thrust of this book is the need for \"community-building\" with the emerging East and Southeast Asia on the part of the \"Trilateral\" areas--Japan, North America, and Europe. \"If Pacific Asia joins the Trilateral world as a region of economic prosperity, security, and good government, the countries within a 'zone of peace' will be dramatically extended.\" Recommendations focus on enhancing international security, continued economic progress, domestic and regional political stability, and accommodating Pacific Asia as \"partners in a global community.\"",

Everything looks better when he decides to take her and their daughter on a sudden trip to Mexico, where he can give Anna the carefully crafted letter that details the nature of his affair.One mistake: He's late meeting them at the airport. He misses the plane; he'll have to take the next flight: and then everything changes.In his first novel, the highly acclaimed The Player, Michael Tolkin explored the emotional geography of Griffin Mill, the Hollywood executive who literally gets away with murder. Now, in Among the Dead, the stakes are raised: What if the executive had a conscience? For Frank, there will be no escaping the consequences. A novel that begins as a domestic drama opens into a nightmare picture of the modern age.Among the Dead is a penetrating, unsettling, and brilliantly written catalog of the truths that lie just beyond the reach of language; a diabolic, blackly comic illumination of the darker corners of the human mind.",

This volume presents a selection of five of his best stories, each brimming with the energy, color, and drive typical of London's vivid story-telling style.\"The White Silence,\" \"In a Far Country,\" and \"An Odyssey of the North\" are suspenseful tales that bring the harshness of the frozen wilderness of the north powerfully to life. \"The Seed of McCoy\" reflects London's experience as a sailor in the South Pacific. The last story, \"The Mexican,\" displays London's celebrated talents as a sportswriter in this sympathetic portrayal of a prizefighter working for the success of the Mexican Revolution. Here are five stories that epitomize Jack London's mastery of the adventure story and the compelling prose style that influenced generations of writers.",

In this illustrated volume he describes the individuals, the historic movements, the watershed moments, and the horrific years that so profoundly changed the world and the Jewish people.In a text interwoven with and illuminated by more than 400 photographs, many of them never before published or long forgotten, we meet the widely dispersed turn-of-the-century Jewish communities of Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Then we encounter with startling immediacy, the impassioned Zionists who set out to reclaim Palestine and the immigrant waves that poured out of Eastern Europe in search of a better life in America - among them, the brilliantly creative writers, composers, actors, and comedians who enthralled millions; and the scientists, judges, legislators, entrepreneurs, and intellectuals whose numbers can hardly be counted but whose thoughts and deeds shaped the modern world.",

        "Authors": "By Kranish, Michael, Mooney, Brian C., and Easton, Nina J.",
        "Description": "On Jan. 27, 2004, Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts accomplished one of the most spectacular turnarounds in modern American politics when he capped a surprise win in the Iowa caucus with a victory in the New Hampshire primary. The 2004 Democratic presidential nomination is now (in the words of Robert Novak) \"John Kerry's to lose.\" Who is the man leading in the race to become the Democratic Party's nominee for president in 2004? And what kind of political leader is he?The outlines of John Kerry's life are familiar: A decorated Vietnam veteran who became an influential, if unlikely, anti-war protester. A lanky 60-year-old who quenches his thirst for danger with high-speed kiteboarding, windsurfing, piloting, motorcycling, and, in some cases, driving. A senator with a reputation as an investigator and foreign policy expert. A man married to one of the richest women in America. But beyond this broad picture, Kerry is something of a mystery to the public, largely because of a complex yet riveting personal and professional history outlined in this book.John F. Kerry: The Complete Biography, the first full and in-depth book about the candidate's life, is based on a highly regarded series on Kerry published in the Boston Globe, plus years of additional reporting. It will explore his background, his service in the military (including significant experiences omitted from Douglas Brinkley's bestselling Tour of Duty), his early legal and political career, his legislative record and the remarkable turnaround in his political fortunes during the 2004 election cycle. This incisive, frank look at Kerry's life, and at his strengths and liabilities, is important reading for anyone interested in the presidential campaign.",

        "Description": "What happened to the unity that so blessed America after 9/11? Where did our sense of determination go?Our political, journalistic, and cultural leaders have mounted a campaign to oppose and impede the war on terror that seemed so vital in that rare moment of clarity. This book is my personal cri du coeur about deception in politics, journalism, and business\u2014especially when it stops us from following through on the work 9/11 has left for us all to do.This book takes on some pretty sacred cows, but it's about time they became fair game.\u2014from the IntroductionAre you appalled by the antiwar tone the news media has taken since the war on terror began\u2014especially \"objective\" news outlets like the New York Times and the network news?Are you wondering when liberal celebrities like Barbara Streisand, Sean Penn, and Susan Sarandon suddenly became geopolitical oracles whose advice we're supposed to value above the wisdom of tenured experts?Are you at a loss to decide who has betrayed us more outrageously: the French who abandoned us in our time of need, or our own elected officials, who tapped our 401(k) savings and the tobacco-settlement windfall with equal abandon?In Off with Their Heads, syndicated columnist and Fox News Cannel political analyst Dick Morris points an accusing finger at the many ways the public has been lied to and misled, pickpocketed and endangered. Whether it's Bill Clinton, who ignored mounting evidence of impending terrorist catastrophe throughout the 1990s, or the members of Congress, who quietly sold our democracy down the river in exchange for lifetime incumbency, Morris rips the cover off the cowardly and duplicitous figures who have sacrificed America's interests for their own.From private corruption to public treachery, even longtime political buffs will marvel at the astonishing behavior Morris reveals at every level of society\u2014and at how it threatens to compromise the American way of life.",

In a concise, easy-to-read format, Dunnigan divulges 150 of the biggest misconceptions about the twentieth century, organizing them under a broad range of such categories as the military, entertainment, technology, and politics.In the same thoughtful but slightly irreverent style that has characterized the Dirty Little Secrets series, Dunnigan explains why nongovernment organizations are actually more powerful than many governments and how the use of droids or combat robots has gone largely unnoticed. He reports the real reason the human life span is so much longer now, and reveals that this century has been as plagued as the Middle Ages by religious wars. And while we might think that wars or epidemics have been the primary cause of death in the twentieth century, Dunnigan reveals that more people have been killed by their own governments than any other means.Perfectly timed for the approach of a new millennium, Dirty Little Secrets of the Twentieth Century reveals the shape of the past and direction of our future through the best-kept secrets and surprises of the century.",

        "Authors": "By Takiff, Michael",
        "Description": "Brave Men, Gentle Heroes presents the frank, moving, and harrowing stories of men who served in World War II and of their sons who served in Vietnam -- fathers and sons bonded as deeply by their common experience in war as by blood.These are men who served in the army, navy, air force, and Marine Corps. Officers and enlisted men, career servicemen and citizen soldiers. Men of European, African, Asian, Latino, and Native American ancestry. Men who speak with the authentic voices of an Indiana farmer, a Brooklyn bus driver, a Louisiana businessman, a Seattle machinist. The contrasts between World War II and Vietnam are everywhere in these compelling accounts: the clear aims of World War II, the muddled goals of Vietnam; the heroes' welcome accorded World War II veterans, the scorn heaped upon their sons. But the stories in Brave Men, Gentle Heroes are also rich with elements intrinsic to all wars and all soldiers: courage, honor, service, duty, youth, adventure, fear, idealism, love of country and of family, exasperation with military bureaucracy. In these pages you will find war's carnage and war's heroism, war's purpose and war's futility, war's meaning and war's tragic meaninglessness.Taken together, the stories in Brave Men, Gentle Heroes tell the history of two wars, each the defining experience of a generation. This is history told not at the level of presidents and generals, but through the recollections of men who shouldered the rifles, manned the ships, and flew the planes. We're familiar with the effects of the two wars on world politics. But what did they do to American families? Molded by the awful crucible of war, these seemingly ordinary men offer extraordinary insights into what it means to be a warrior, an American, a father, and a son.Brave Men, Gentle Heroes is a book for those who have been to war and those who have been spared its horror. It is a book for individuals to reflect upon and families to share.",

Readers flocked to the story of six friends in Boston because both the voice and the characters Valdes-Rodriguez created were utterly fresh.  A brand new, large, and eager audience came out for a book they felt had been created just for them-young American women whose Hispanic side had been overlooked by commercial novels until The Dirty Girls Social Club.In Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez' delicious new novel-each a Latina in her late 20's -take Los Angeles by storm in Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez' delicious new novel.  Marcella, Olivia and Alexis have bonded not only over the trouble with men but about how tough it is to make life work in L.A. no matter what you do.  Marcella is a hot young television actress, hardly able to enjoy the life she's bought for herself and certainly not enjoying her body, which is never quite perfect enough.  Olivia's boy is her toddler son-and she's tethered to him and to her suburban mommy track so tightly the other girls sometimes cringe.  Alexis has a smart mouth and an ample body; she's a beautiful musicians' manager with loads of style but about enough self-esteem to fill a Prada card case.  Her complicated love affair with the casually sexy Cuban rapper Goyo is a deeply satisfying romance that will delight readers almost as much as the emotional richness and girly fun of the heroines' friendship.",

        "Description": "Set in the apocalyptic atmosphere of 1900--a time when many Americans were looking for signs foretelling the end of the world--Feather Crowns is the story of a young woman who unintentionally creates a national sensation. A farm wife living near the small town of Hopewell, Kentucky, Christianna Wheeler gives birth to the first recorded set of quintuplets in North America.  Christie is suddenly thrown into a swirling storm of public attention. Thousands of strangers descend on her home, all wanting too see and touch the \"miracle babies.\" One visitor crawls right in through the window! The fate of the babies and the bizarre events that follow their births propel Christie and her husband far from home, on a journey that exposes them to the turbulent pageant of life at the beginning of the modern era.  Richly detailed and poignant, Feather Crowns focuses on one woman but opens out ultimately into the chronicle of a time and a people. Written in Bobbie Ann Mason&#39;s taut yet lyrical prose, the novel ranges from a peaceful farming community to a fire-and-brimstone revival camp, from seamy traveling shows to the hushed precincts of the nation&#39;s capital. Moving through the center of it all is Christie, a charming, headstrong, loving woman who struggles heroically to come to terms with the extraordinary events of her long life.  Feather Crowns is an American parable of profound resonance. Spellbindingly readable, it is a novel of classic stature destined to confirm Bobbie Ann Mason as one of America&#39;s most important writers.",

Now that the curtain has abruptly come down, she's back where it all started -- in tiny Mooney -- living in a rundown old house perched on the edge of nowhere, meaning to carry out her widowhood in the manner of her old maid Aunt Dove, in peaceful solitude.But life, and the folks of Mooney, have other plans for Lucy. In hardly any time at all, she's mortified her entire family. And without even trying, she's caught the eye of the local handyman, Ash Farrell -- lifting eyebrows and setting tongues wagging. Everyone in town, it seems, thinks theguitar-playing, lady-loving Ash is the wrong choice of company for a brand new widow. All Lucy Hatch knows for sure is that she hasn't had much worth remembering in her first thirty-three years. This is her life, after all, and for the very first time, she intends to live it.Marsha Moyer's exhilarating debut is a funny, poignant, and winsome tale about self-discovery and starting over at the beginning -- and of love popping up in the most unlikely place and time to transform a heart and nourish a soul.

        "Authors": "By Crace, Jim",
        "Description": "Lying in the sand dunes of Baritone Bay are the bodies of a middle-aged couple. Celice and Joseph, in their mid-50s and married for more than 30 years, are returning to the seacoast where they met as students. Instead, they are battered to death by a thief with a chunk of granite. Their corpses lie undiscovered and rotting for a week, prey to sand crabs, flies, and gulls. Yet there remains something touching about the scene, with Joseph's hand curving lightly around his wife's leg, \"quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.\" \"Their bodies had expired, but anyone could tell\u2014just look at them\u2014that Joseph and Celice were still devoted. For while his hand was touching her, curved round her shin, the couple seemed to have achieved that peace the world denies, a period of grace, defying even murder. Anyone who found them there, so wickedly disfigured, would nevertheless be bound to see that something of their love had survived the death of cells. The corpses were surrendered to the weather and the earth, but they were still a man and wife, quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.\"From that moment forward, Being Dead becomes less about murder and more about death. Alternating chapters move back in time from the murder in hourly and two-hourly increments. As the narrative moves backward, we see Celice and Joseph make the small decisions about their day that will lead them inexorably towards their own deaths. In other chapters the narrative moves forward. Celice and Joseph are on vacation and nobody misses them until they do not return. Thus, it is six days before their bodies are found. Crace describes in minute detail their gradual return to the land with the help of crabs, birds, and the numerous insects that attack the body and gently and not so gently prepare it for the dust-to-dust phase of death.",

Three pregnancies, three kids, a high-pressure career, and an unhappy marriage seemed to undermine her every effort to lose weight. But then Lunden decided to fight back. Today, she's fit and trim - and feels great. She still considers herself a work in progress, but her newfound energy fuels her career, her athletic passions, and her total state of well-being.Lunden has spent years in the kitchen cooking for her family, and the philosophy behind her recipes is simple: in addition to being low in fat, high in nutrition, and utterly delicious, each dish is easy to prepare (everyone is pressed for time), uses readily available ingredients (what is quinoa, anyway?), and adapts well to substitutions (if you hate peppers, use carrots instead).Each of the more than 100 recipes comes complete with nutritional information, serving size, and substitution possibilities. There are tasty appetizers like Quesadillas, soul-satisfying soups such as Italian Minestrone, and more than a dozen tempting salads, including Curried Chicken Salad with Mango. For main courses, Lunden serves up Spaghetti with White Bean Sauce, Chili Burgers, Chicken Fajitas, Roasted Salmon with Herb Crust, and other family favorites. Her daughter's vegetarianism inspired meatless main dishes such as Spinach Frittata with Spicy Tomato Sauce and vegetable accompaniments like Twice Baked Parmesan Potatoes and Sweet Potato and Parnsip Casserole. She also offers fun recipes for kids to make: Pita Pizza, Lasagna, and Macaroni and Cheese. And because everyone deserves dessert, there are Vanilla Cheesecake with Fresh Berries, Peach Melba with Raspberry Sauce, Country Apple Pie, and more.",

The father, Nelson O'Brien, is an enterprising Irish immigrant who travels to Cuba as a photographer during the Spanish-American War in 1898, and there he meets his future wife, the sensitive, aristocratic, poetic Mariela Montez. As they are enroute to America in 1902, their first daughter, Margarita, whose reminiscences inform much of this novel's narrative, is born at sea. The Montez O'Briens settle in a small Pennsylvania town, where Nelson practices his photography trade and runs the Jewel Box Movie Theater, and Mariela gives birth to thirteen more daughters and then, finally, a son.As Margarita looks back on her long and full life, the novel recounts the lives, loves, and tragedies of the Montez O'Briens and their always complex relations with one another. It also follows Emilio through his days in Greenwich Village, the army, and Hollywood, where, as Monty O'Brien, he stars in grade-B detective and Tarzan movies and pals around with screen idols like Errol Flynn. Never altogether at peace in the overwhelming feminine world of his family, he searches restlessly for an elusive true love. And after an unhappy early marriage, Margarita herself finds the deepest passion of her life in extreme old age.The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien is a raucous and heartfelt epic that spans both the continent and our century, a celebration of the moments of earthly happiness that give meaning to diverse yet deeply interrelated existences and of the constantly surprising, regenerating life force that keeps insisting on change and renewal.",

From Due West they moved to Covington, Georgia, and eventually to \"L.

A year on an army base in Alaska provided her first full exposure to the white world.

        "Description": "From Robert B. Reich-political economist, distinguished public servant, and author of The Work of Nations, Locked in the Cabinet, and other acclaimed and best-selling books-a brilliant analysis of the new economy and how it is affecting our lives, for better and for worse.The dizzying exuberance of the Internet-driven marketplace offers unprecedented opportunities and an ever-expanding choice of deals, products, investments, and jobs-ranging from the merely attractive to the nearly irresistible-for the people with the right talents and skills. The technology that is the motor of this transformation relentlessly sharpens competition. When consumers can shift allegiance with the click of a mouse, sellers must make constant improvements by cutting costs, adding value, and creating new products. This is a boon to us as consumers, but it's wreaking havoc in the rest of our lives.Reich demonstrates that the faster the economy changes-with new innovations and opportunities engendering faster switches by customers and inves-tors in response-the harder it is for people to be confident of what they will be earning next year or even next month, what they will be doing, where they will be doing it. In short, those fabulous new deals of the fabulous new economy carry a steep price: more frenzied lives, less security, more economic and social stratification, the loss of time and energy for family, friendship, community, and self.With the clarity and insight that are his hallmarks, and using examples from everyday life, Reich delineates what success is coming to mean in our time-the pitfalls and downturns hidden in the apparent advantages and advances-and suggests how we might create a more balanced society and more satisfying lives. The trends he discusses are powerful indeed, but they are not irreversible, or at least not unalterable.The Future of Success is a stunning, timely book, certain to galvanize the nation's attention and transform the way we look at our future.",

        "Authors": "By Peary, Danny and McCarver, Tim",
        "Description": "Nineteen Ninety-Eight was the greatest season in baseball history. While Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa engaged in an epic duel for baseball's most coveted individual record -- Roger Maris's 61 home runs, the New York Yankees set new standards for team excellence and established themselves as one of the greatest clubs in the history of the game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tim McCarver broadcast the climax of each of these extraordinary achievements and is uniquely positioned as a former player, a commentator, and writer to put 1998 into its proper perspective. McCarver is baseball's best analyst and, as he showed with Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans, he is as eloquent and witty on the page as he is behind the microphone. In The Perfect Season, McCarver revels in the homer race and the Yankees but shows that the season contained so much more, ensuring it will stand out as the best there has been. Star players performing to the height of their powers broke records set by true legends of baseball, linking today's players with those who exist somewhere between myth and memory: Ruth and Cobb; Gehrig and Mays. The Perfect Season describes the accomplishments of veterans like Juan Gonzalez, Roger Clemens, Ken Griffey, Jr., Mike Piazza, and Barry Bonds, and of the exceptional young players who hold the future of the game in their hands: Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra, and Kerry Wood. Tim McCarver also laments the passing of some friends and colleagues: Richie Ashburn, Harry Caray, and Dan Quisenberry, and celebrates the careers of some stars who retired after the 1998 season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Perfect Season is a comprehensive account of 1998 and the perfect souvenir of baseball's greatest year. With it, fans can remember the season in which they got back into the habit of watching the game and reestablished baseball as America's Pastime.",

This time, though, there is a suspect: In a shocking turn of events, Abigail Griffen, star prosecutor in the Multnomah County district attorney's office and estranged wife of Justice Griffen, is charged with first-degree murder.Abbie hires Matthew Reynolds, a legendary attorney who specializes in death-penalty defenses, to represent her. Reynolds is assisted by Tracy Cavanaugh, a young lawyer who had clerked with Laura Rizzatti on the Supreme Court. As Tracy investigates the Griffen case for Reynolds, she stumbles upon information that initially makes her think the Griffen and Rizzatti murders are related; she soon finds further evidence that hints of serious corruption on the Court. Ultimately, though, as she pieces the puzzle together, Tracy begins to suspect she's uncovered a plot so bizarre that she is no longer sure whom to trust, or where to turn.

        "Description": "Wall Street Journal reporter George Anders explains why managed care is so appealing to employers and insurers and how HMO bureaucrats can thwart necessary, even life-saving treatment under the guise of cost efficiency. Health Against Wealth takes an unflinching look at the profit-hungry entrepreneurs who have poured into this new \"health industry\" and provides alarming examples of political manipulation by increasingly powerful HMO lobbyists. At the same time, the book explores the hopes and frustrations of people in the health-care system: patients facing life-threatening crises, renowned doctors humbled by the constraints of the new medical bureaucracy, disillusioned social planners who genuinely thought they had found a better way to provide health care.Anders concludes with a compelling list of corrective measures that can make the managed-care revolution work in the public interest. He recommends a new round of consumer activism, tighter regulation of HMOs' ways of paying doctors and hospitals, and the creation of independent review boards to help make decisions about complex cases. He also calls for redefining the term \"emergency\" to ensure fuller coverage in a crisis; holding HMOs accountable for their mistakes through the courts; and forming doctor-employer partnership that can bypass HMOs entirely.",

It is there he meets Jessie, a Creole prostitute who engages him in a venture that has its origins in the complexities and despair of the conflict he has left behind. He also befriends a deputy inspector of customs named Herman Melville who, largely forgotten as a writer, is condemned to live in the wake of his vanished literary success and in the turmoil of his fractured family.Delving into the depths of this country's heart and soul, Frederick Busch's stunning novel is a gripping portrait of a nation trying to heal from the ravages of war--and of one man's attempt to recapture a taste for life through the surging currents of his own emotions, ambitions, and shattered conscience.",

Wurtman's Serotonin Seeker's Diet tells you how to allocate protein, carbohydrate, and fat dosages to literally increase the power of your brain to control your eating. The result? Restored energy, an end to emotional overeating, and permanent weight control. You will learn to identify your overeating triggers, follow a daily meal and snack plan that makes you feel so good you'll want to do it, avoid foods that exacerbate stress or block the stress-breaker foods from working, and combine exercise with stress-breaker foods to feel good and lose weight faster.Along with the basic Serotonin Seeker's Diet for daily stress, Wurtman offers food plans tailored for other situational and biological stresses known to interfere with serotonin activity: a PMS plan, a winter/summer food plan, an ex-smoker's food plan, a post-diet plan, a stressed-mommy plan, and a plan for those who work shifts and are awake when their bodies want to be asleep. Finally, you will learn how these plans can maximize the effects of new serotonin-based weight-loss medications.The Serotonin Solution is the only diet book based on Wurtman's original discovery of the scientific relationship between overeating and serotonin. It can help you banish emotional overeating forever and take control of your appetite for good.",

Not the new generation of talk-radio hosts, and not Bill O'Reilly, Roger Ailes, and the entire Fox network. This is the book Al Franken fans have been waiting for (and his foes have been dreading).

It was the era of Sinclair Lewis, Emma Goldman, William Randolph Hearst, and John Reed. It was a time of union busting, anarchism, and Tammany Hall.Lincoln Steffens\u2014eternally curious, a worldwide celebrity, and a man of magnetic charm\u2014was a towering figure at the center of this world. He was friends with everyone from Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to Ernest Hemingway and James Joyce. As an editor at McClure\u2019s magazine\u2014along with Ida Tarbell he was one of the original muckrakers\u2014he published articles that exposed the political and social corruption of the time. His book,Shame of the Cities, took on the corruption of local politics and his coverage of bad business practices on Wall Street helped lead to the creation of the Federal Reserve.Lincoln Steffens was truly a man of his season, and his life reflects his times: impetuous, vital, creative, striving. In telling the story of this outsized American figure, Justin Kaplan also tells the riveting tale of turn-of-the-century America.",

        "Authors": "By Zukav, Gary and Francis, Linda",
        "Description": "With the rare combination of profound psychological insight and deep spirituality that has already drawn millions of readers to his two great national bestsellers, The Seat of the Soul and Soul Stories, prize-winning author Gary Zukav now joins with his spiritual partner Linda Francis to help us to develop a new emotional awareness that is central to our spiritual development. In The Seat of the Soul, Zukav brilliantly set forth his fundamental concepts, explaining how the expansion of human perception beyond the five senses leads to a new understanding of power as the alignment of the personality with the soul -- \"authentic power.\" In Soul Stories, he showed how such concepts as harmony, cooperation, sharing, and reverence for Life express themselves in other people's lives. Now, in The Heart of the Soul, he and Francis take the next major step forward in showing us the importance of emotional awareness in applying these concepts to our own daily lives.  Zukav and Francis show how true emotional awareness transforms the human experience. Although developing emotional awareness is challenging and difficult because it requires becoming aware of our buried emotional pain, it is also enormously rewarding. The Heart of the Soul shows us how to free ourselves from our compulsions, fixations, obsessions, and addictions -- such as anger, workaholism, perfectionism, obsessive eating, alcohol and drug abuse, and sexual addiction -- that prevent us from living a fulfilling and meaningful life. It also provides the reader with the necessary tools to replace the desire to avoid painful emotions with the desire to explore every aspect of consciousness, and to cultivate the parts of ourselves that contribute the most to Life.   Emotional awareness -- becoming aware of everything we are feeling at every moment -- is one of the most challenging tasks we can undertake. As Zukav relates in the book, \"The longest journey that you will make in your life is from your head to your heart.\" For all of us, that is the unending journey toward spiritual growth -- toward wholeness, wisdom, and compassion -- and the healing that will allow us to achieve our fullest potential.  Zukav and Francis do not discount the violence and destruction that pervade our world, but they recognize a new, emerging consciousness that has the power to transform it. The Heart of the Soul will be a powerful revelation, enabling readers to recognize emotional awareness as a key component in the creation of authentic power. Filled with helpful tools, empowering practices, and compelling drawings, The Heart of the Soul is a life-changing work that can reshape our lives for the better. It is a book to read and reread many times.",

        "Title": "Danger in the Comfort Zone: From Boardroom to Mailroom -- How to Break the Entitlement Habit That's Killing American Business",
        "Authors": "By Bardwick, Judith M.",
        "Description": "Danger in the Comfort Zone examines the phenomenon of the \"entitlement\" mentality in the American workforce -- people's preoccupation with their rewards rather than their responsibilities. Bardwick describes three basic mindsets and shows the effect of each on individuals and their organizations: * Entitlement -- people feel entitled to rewards and lethargic about having to earn them; motivation and job satisfaction are low * Fear -- people are paralyzed; the threat of layoffs makes them focus on protecting their jobs rather than doing them well * Earning -- people are energized by challenge; they know their accomplishments will be noticed -- and rewarded In this paperback edition, Bardwick points out that although the \"fear\" element has undoubtedly grown in the last few years, the entitlement attitude is still firmly entrenched at all levels. She offers additional chapters with new, specific techniques for pulling people out of the quagmire of fear and complacency, and igniting them with the energy of true earning.",

        "Authors": "By Nader, Ralph and Smith, Wesley J.",
        "Description": "The airline industry is responsible for the lives of nearly half a billion people annually. As passenger loads increase, commercial air transportation grows more dangerous, and little is being done by the airlines or the Federal Aviation Administration to reverse the trend.In Collision Course, Ralph Nader and Wesley J. Smith warn that you, as an airline patron, face a growing list of perils: outmoded airline fleets, an increasing number of undertrained pilots, unreliable air traffic control equipment, aircraft maintenance fraud, inadequate inspections, insufficient crashworthiness, overcrowded airspace... even terrorism.Nader and Smith not only reveal how the lives of airline passengers are put at risk, they also outline specific steps the airlines, the FAA, and you can take to restore commercial aviation safety and reliability.Collision Course isn't just another expose of public endangerment by industry, nor is it merely another indictment of bureaucratic complacency. It's a call to action that could prevent thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries. This is one book that no airline passenger, carrier, or regulator can afford to ignore.",
