        "Authors": "By McClay, John B. and Matthews, Wendy L.",
        "Description": "The legal system isn't usually considered a wellspring of laughter, but every once in a while, a jovial judge is faced with a case of such absurdity that it fairly demands an equally amusing response. Presented here are some 100 of the most outrageous cases and judicial rulings ever handed down, dating from the present day back to the 13th century and covering such fertile legal--and laughable--grounds as a blowtorch-wielding hairdresser, the case of the bovine house-wrecker, the man who sued himself for breach of trust and other ticklish torts. From the case of Schwartz vs. Warwick-Philadelphia Corporation, which shows that brotherly love takes a backseat to backside injury when a slip and fall has plaintiffs seeking damages for their dented posteriors, to Aetna Insurance vs. Sachs, concerning a poodle who piddled on a priceless rug, these judicial rulings offer an hilarious perspective on the law and those who administer it.",

        "Description": "A modern day parable teaching the joy of generosity, service, and relationships.In the tradition of the best-seller The One Minute Manager, authors Ken Blanchard and fast-food entrepreneur S. Truett Cathy (Chic-Fil-A) create a parable that demonstrates the virtues of generosity.The Broker is a young man on the way up the corporate ladder who has found a niche for making money through high-tech investing. His imposing home, his chauffeur-driven limousine, his deep-sea fishing boat, and his rubbing shoulders with leading New York executives create the illusion of success, yet deep inside he is restless and feels insignificant. He reads an article about The Executive, the CEO of a very large and successful company, who claims the greatest joy in his life is his ability to give to others. This piques The Broker's curiosity. He thinks he might get a competitive edge by meeting with The Executive.The Broker is impressed by all the antique and collector automobiles in the first floor lobby of The Executive's office building. 'He must really worship cars,' he tells The Assistant. 'Not at all,' The Assistant says. 'He displays these extraordinary machines to inspire us--to remind us that each of us is unique.'The Broker's worldview continues to be shaken and turned upside down as he talks to The Executive and hears the principles that form his life. The Executive describes the plan he has developed that turns giving into a tremendous pleasure. He calls it The Generosity Factor--a way to give time, talent, treasure, and touch to those in need.The advice The Broker receives and the relationship he develops with The Executive provide a pleasant surprise and a unique twist on what it means to truly succeed--whether in business, at home, or in life.",

The financial and moral stakes of the case are staggering, and Seeley suspects that murder cannot be ruled out as a hardball litigation tactic of big-pharma adversary St. Gall Laboratories. As Seeley travels between San Francisco and Silicon Valley to prepare for trial, dark facts surface concerning the vaccine\u2019s discovery by Vaxtek scientist Alan Steinhardt and its alleged theft by St. Gall researcher Lily Warren. Ethical quandaries deepen into mortal danger as the trial, under the stern prodding of federal judge Ellen Farnsworth, rushes to its unexpected end. A timely and fascinating look at how the law operates at its most arcane yet financially consequential, A Patent Lie is further evidence that Paul Goldstein is an emerging master of the legal thriller.",

        "Description": "How an image-obsessed president transformed the way we think about politics and politicians. To his conservative supporters in 1940s southern California, Richard Nixon was a populist everyman; to liberal intellectuals of the 1950s, he was \"Tricky Dick,\" a devious manipulator; to 1960s radicals, a shadowy conspirator; to the Washington press corps, a pioneering spin doctor; to his loyal Middle Americans, a victim of liberal hatred; to recent historians, an unlikely liberal. Nixon's Shadow rediscovers these competing images of the protean Nixon, showing how each was created and disseminated in American culture and how Nixon's tinkering with his own image often backfired. During Nixon's long tenure on the national stageand through the succession of \"new Nixons\" so brilliantly described hereAmericans came to realize how thoroughly politics relies on manipulation. Since Nixon, it has become impossible to discuss politics without asking: What is the politician's \"real\" character? How authentic or inauthentic is he? What image is he trying to project? More than what Nixon did, this fascinating book reveals what Nixon meant.16 pages of photographs.",

Now with her evocative, luminous style and painstaking research, she takes her family's story even further, back to a little-chronicled, deliberately-forgotten time...and the struggle of three extraordinary generations of African-American men to forge brutal injustice and shattered promise into a limitless future for their children... RED RIVERFor the newly-freed black residents of Colfax, Louisiana, the beginning of Reconstruction promised them the right to vote, own property-and at last control their own lives.Tademy saw a chance to start a school for his children and neighbors. His friend Israel Smith was determined to start a community business and gain economic freedom. But in the space of a day, marauding whites would \"take back\" Colfax in one of the deadliest cases of racial violence in the South. In the bitter aftermath, Sam and Israel's fight to recover and build their dreams will draw on the best they and their families have to give-and the worst they couldn't have foreseen. Sam's hidden resilience will make him an unexpected leader, even as it puts his conscience and life on the line. Israel finds ironic success-and the bitterest of betrayals. And their greatest challenge will be to pass on to their sons and grandsons a proud heritage never forgotten-and the strength to meet the demands of the past and future in their own unique ways. An unforgettable achievement, a history brought to vibrant life through one of the most memorable families in fiction, RED RIVER is about fathers and sons, husbands and wives-and the hopeful, heartbreaking choices we all must make to claim the legacy that is ours.",

        "Description": "During the last ten years, Louise Erdrich has written seven critically acclaimed and best-selling books and has also given birth to three children. In The Blue Jays' Dance, her first major work of nonfiction, she brilliantly and poignantly examines the joys and frustrations, the compromises and insights, the difficult struggles and profound emotional satisfactions she experienced in the course of one twelve-month period - from a winter pregnancy through a spring and summer of new motherhood to a fall return to writing.Erdrich illuminates afresh the large and small events that mothers - parents - everywhere will recognize and appreciate. A keenly spiritual observer of the natural world, she turns a poet's eye to the harmony of growth and change, of beginnings and endings, of love and longing. From the vantage point of a small house in New England, she looks out to the North Dakota horizon of her childhood and inward to an infant's first glimpse of a wild bird.The Blue Jay's Dance takes the mundane routines of everyday life and renders them marvelous, even while it records the odyssey of a woman's deepening awareness of the rhythms that bind families together. Once again, Louise Erdrich discovers the universal within the particular moment and gives full-bodied expression to that most common and yet most mysterious of all human tasks: the passing on of life.",

What are your thoughts on newspapermen 'making the news?' Are actions like Hearst's ever justified? It has been speculated that the newspaper moguls of this era were working in conjunction with the government. Do you believe that there is truth to this speculation? 3. Between the unique romance, a major historical event, and a good old-fashioned spy story, White Rose has something for nearly everyone. What elements of this novel drew you in the most? 4. This seems like a novel that can be enjoyed by men and women alike. Any thoughts on this? 5. Which characters intrigued you the most? Why? 6. This novel is essentially a love story, a triangle, hence the juxtaposition of the chapters with Katherine Decker in Washington, D.C. What significance did Katherine's perspective contribute to the story? 7. There are plans to adapt White Rose into a movie, and a rumor that Hearst will play a bigger role in the movie version. If you were the casting director, who would you choose to play the parts of Evangelina, Carlos, Karl, and Katherine? 8. Were you able to figure out the clues in the poem that Evangelina wrote for Karl to help him break her out of prison? 9. Ms. Ephron's style is minimalistic. Did you feel the short, cinematic chapters transported you into late nineteenth century Cuba? 10. Do you think today's tabloid journalism is rooted in yellow journalism? 11. Have you read other novels or nonfiction about this period in Cuban history? If so, did you find consistencies in regard to the events depicted in White Rose? 12. What were your favorite moments in White Rose? 13. Can you think of other historical events and figures--that have not been previously mined--that would make for similarly exciting",

        "Description": "If it was once thought that to look into the heavens was to look into the face of God, then the brilliant and striking images we're now seeing from deep in space, many from the Hubble Space Telescope, provide a glimpse of an eternally careful handiwork once invisible to the naked eye. We can now look into the outermost reaches of space, with spiral galaxies cartwheeling against an infinitude of black space, exploding supernovas and stellar nurseries, vast clouds of dark dust slowly parting to reveal the luminous star clusters of a nebula. Until recently, neither astronomers nor the public had ever seen such wondrous phenomena like this before at such close range. The deep space images of embryonic solar systems, black holes, and dying stars are now within our reach-and they're changing the way we look at our universe, ourselves, and God. Hundreds of years ago, science and belief fought a bitter war resulting in a longstanding split between reason and faith. But as the 20th century draws to a close, the Big Bang theory and discoveries in the laws of the constants provide ample evidence of the fine-tuning required to bring about our universe, leading scientists to wonder: Could such a carefully balanced cosmology be merely an accident' The Hand of God sheds new light on the timeless relationship between maker and made, creator and creation. These remarkable images provide an awe-inspiring background for quotes by scientists, poets, artists, astronauts, and others who have struggled eloquently to make sense of the universe and God's hand in it.",

Unlike so many other children who fall through the cracks of our overburdened foster-care system, her experience was nothing short of miraculous, thanks to several extraordinary women who stepped forward to love, nurture, guide, teach, and challenge her to become the accomplished actress, philanthropist, and mother that she is today.Rowell spent her first weeks of life as a boarder infant before being placed with a Caucasian foster family. Although her stay lasted for only two years, at this critical stage Rowell was given a foundation of love by the first of what would be an amazing array of women, each of whom presented herself for different purposes at every dramatic turn of Rowell's life. In this deeply touching memoir, Rowell pays tribute to her personal champions: the mothers, grandmothers, aunts, mentors, teachers, and sisters who each have fascinating stories to tell. Among them are Agatha Armstead, Rowell's longest-term foster mother, a black Bostonian on whose rural Maine farm Rowell's fire to reach for greatness was lit; Esther Brooks, a Paris-trained prima ballerina, Rowell's first mentor at the Cambridge School of Ballet; Rosa Turner, a Boston inner-city fosterer who taught Rowell lessons of independence; Sylvia Silverman, a mother and teacher whose home in a well-kept middle-class suburban neighborhood prepared Rowell for her transition out of foster care and into New York City's wild worlds of ballet and acting and adulthood.In spite of support from individuals and agencies, Rowell nonetheless carried the burden of loneliness and anxiety, common to most foster children, particularly those \"orphans of the living\" who are never adopted. Heroically overcoming those obstacles, Rowell also reaches a moment when she can embrace her biological mother, Dorothy, and, most important, accept herself.Ultimately, The Women Who Raised Me is a story that belongs to each of us as it shines a glowing light on the transformational power of mentoring, love, art, and womanhood.",

        "Description": "The first-born son of his generation, Peter Balakian grew up in a close, extended family, sheltered by 1950s and '60s New Jersey suburbia and immersed in an all-American boyhood defined by rock 'n' roll, adolescent pranks, and a passion for the New York Yankees that he shared with his beloved grandmother. But beneath this sunny world lay the dark specter of the trauma his family and ancestors had experienced--the Turkish government's extermination of more than a million Armenians in 1915, including many of Balakian's relatives, in the century's first genocide.In elegant, moving prose, Black Dog of Fate charts Balakian's growth and personal awakening to the facts of his family's history and the horrifying aftermath of the Turkish government's continued campaign to cover up one of the worst crimes ever committed against humanity. In unearthing the secrets of a family's past and how they affect its present, Black Dog of Fate gives fresh meaning to the story of what it means to be an American.",

        "Title": "This Side of Eternity",
        "Authors": "By McMillan, Rosalyn",
        "Description": "From the beloved author of The Flip Side of Sin, One Better, Blue Collar Blues, and the national bestseller Knowing comes a beautiful and evocative story of one family's struggle for survival amid the hope and trauma of the civil rights movement in Tennessee. In what promises to be her most memorable book to date, Rosalyn McMillan brings to life one of the most extraordinary chapters in American history.  Rich in the tradition of Southern storytelling, This Side of Eternity is the tale of an African-American family's determination to stay together and to survive in any way they can in a world of discrimination, limited opportunity, and unendurable poverty. With powerful, penetrating language and richly developed characters, McMillan deftly weaves historical events into a compelling, unforgettable saga reminiscent of Gone With the Wind.  When Anne Russell's father is killed in an accident on the job in the late 1960s, her family must survive on its own through labor strikes, civil rights protests, and a racial tension that permeates every aspect of their daily lives. Struggling with the explosive social issues around her and the inertia of a family unwilling to seize a better life, Anne begins to make it on her own and embody the proud, indefatigable spirit of those around her who would succeed in changing the world.  Anne grows to learn, however, that changing the world can often be easier than changing the people around you, including those you love most. As the years pass, and the lessons of the movement that so affected Anne's family begin to fade, Anne finds herself continually trying to hold everyone together, despite their ongoing attempts to break everything apart. As children grow into adults, and parents into grandparents, the struggle for freedom and opportunity remains as daunting and relevant as when Anne was a child. Just as she once fought to save her siblings from the doldrums of poverty, she must now do the same for her own children.  This Side of Eternity is a truly unforgettable book that shows the strength of faith and family against the backdrop of the African-American experience through the civil rights movement and beyond. Rosalyn McMillan's finest work yet, it is guaranteed to rank among the best and brightest African-American fiction being written today.",

        "Authors": "By Palmer, Laura and Jessop, Carolyn",
        "Description": "The dramatic first-person account of life inside an ultra-fundamentalist American religious sect, and one woman\u2019s courageous flight to freedom with her eight children.When she was eighteen years old, Carolyn Jessop was coerced into an arranged marriage with a total stranger: a man thirty-two years her senior. Merril Jessop already had three wives. But arranged plural marriages were an integral part of Carolyn\u2019s heritage: She was born into and raised in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), the radical offshoot of the Mormon Church that had settled in small communities along the Arizona-Utah border. Over the next fifteen years, Carolyn had eight children and withstood her husband\u2019s psychological abuse and the watchful eyes of his other wives who were locked in a constant battle for supremacy.Carolyn\u2019s every move was dictated by her husband\u2019s whims. He decided where she lived and how her children would be treated. He controlled the money she earned as a school teacher. He chose when they had sex; Carolyn could only refuse\u2014at her peril. For in the FLDS, a wife\u2019s compliance with her husband determined how much status both she and her children held in the family. Carolyn was miserable for years and wanted out, but she knew that if she tried to leave and got caught, her children would be taken away from her. No woman in the country had ever escaped from the FLDS and managed to get her children out, too. But in 2003, Carolyn chose freedom over fear and fled her home with her eight children. She had $20 to her name.Escape exposes a world tantamount to a prison camp, created by religious fanatics who, in the name of God, deprive their followers the right to make choices, force women to be totally subservient to men, and brainwash children in church-run schools. Against this background, Carolyn Jessop\u2019s flight takes on an extraordinary, inspiring power. Not only did she manage a daring escape from a brutal environment, she became the first woman ever granted full custody of her children in a contested suit involving the FLDS. And in 2006, her reports to the Utah attorney general on church abuses formed a crucial part of the case that led to the arrest of their notorious leader, Warren Jeffs.",

For those who have the courage to look deeper, one scratch of the surface reveals a place of fierce loyalties, submerged passions and a violence reserved for anyone foolish enough to defy a time-honored way of life. At the center of this community - and of this astonishing novel - is Rose of Sharon. Cut off by the death of her son and by her own fears from the only life she ever imagined, Rose has become numb to her neighbors' petty jealousies and to the casual brutalities of her husband, Dashnell.As she goes about the business of making a home for her husband and caring for a mother whose disappointment in her permeates every frail connection they achieve, Rose observes life around her with a merciless and razor-sharp eye. She sees the legacy of hate that shapes the lives of her family and friends in their small southern town; the men whose misplaced pride finds its only solace in occasional eruptions of savagery; and the women who ward off loneliness and desperation with their hurtful gossip. Rose privately opposes the things she sees, but keeping the secrets of Prince George County has become second nature. Until one night when those secrets are shattered by a single gunshot and Rose makes a decision from which there is no turning back. With one life-altering act, Rose finally dares to tell the truth - and earns her one chance at redemption.",
