        "Description": "Nicholas Barber is a twenty-three-year-old priest who, fearing the wrath of the bishop for breaking his vows of chastity, takes up with a troupe of traveling players. Coming to a small town in the middle of winter, the troupe puts on their usual morality play but gets caught up in a drama of a different kind: a murder has taken place, and a mute-and-deaf girl stands condemned, awaiting execution. Seeing an opportunity to attract a larger audience than ever, the players go through the town collecting information about the murder, which they weave into their next performance. As they perform, the story takes on a life of its own. Soon they learn that their drama is far closer to the dangerous truth than they originally imagined - and they are summoned to perform for the local potentate, the powerful Lord de Guise, who has his own reasons to be interested in their version of events.Bringing fourteenth-century England to vibrant life, Barry Unsworth deftly shows us a time that is far off yet strangely familiar, where underneath medieval trappings lie the same corruption and moral dilemmas we face today.",

With the final installment, The Granny, our comedic and lovable heroine, Agnes Browne, has a French lover, six children in their twenties\u2014including one in prison\u2014and a wee grandchild of her own. But the world is spinning fast for Agnes\u2014especially considering that her lover wants her to become \"a sexual animal\" and that her family's far-flung fortune is beyond her control. The members of the Browne family split up to make it in the world on their own until a tragedy brings the brood back together again\u2014and love keeps them that way forever.",

But it's a dangerous game she's put into play, dangling the bait (whose name is Melissa) squarely in front of her unfaithful husband. No sooner have she and David settled themselves in the first-class dining saloon than a stranger appears at their table. It's no coincidence. Their dinner companion turns out to be a charming bounder named Burton Rutledge, the sort, David says, \"who if he can convince us he's got plenty of money, then there's no way we'd suspect he might be after ours.\"Slowly, inexorably, like the first-growth clarets served at table, their offshore stories unfold to breathe with life and energy, enlivened every nautical mile by vintage Higgins dialogue.",

Without Remorse, however, goes beyond anything he has ever done.Its hero is John Kelly, a man well familiar to Clancy's readers by his code name, Mr. Clark. In The Sum of All Fears, he hunted down nuclear terrorists. In Clear and Present Danger, he led aerial raids against drug lords. In The Cardinal of the Kremlin, he spirited away a KGB chief's family by submarine. But nothing will ever be as deadly - or as personal - as the danger he must face in Without Remorse.John Kelly, former Navy SEAL and Vietnam veteran, is still getting over the accidental death of his wife six months before, when he befriends a young woman with a decidedly checkered past. When that past reaches out for her in a particularly horrifying fashion, he vows revenge and, assembling all of his old skills, sets out to track down the men responsible, before it can happen again.At the same time, the Pentagon is readying an operation to rescue a key group of prisoners in a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp. One man, they find, knows the terrain around the camp better than anyone else they have: a certain former Navy SEAL named John Kelly.Kelly has his own mission. The Pentagon wants him for theirs. Attempting to juggle the two, Kelly (now code-named Mr. Clark) finds himself confronted by a vast array of enemies, both at home and abroad - men so skillful that the slightest misstep means death. And the fate of dozens of people, including Kelly himself, rests on his making sure that misstep never happens.Men aren't born dangerous. They grow dangerous. And the most dangerous of all, Kelly learns, are the ones you least expect...As Clancy takes us through the twists and turns of Without Remorse, he blends the exceptional realism and authenticity that are his hallmarks with intricate plotting, knife-edge suspense and a remarkable cast of characters.",

Her two smart-alecky kids are driving her to distraction, and she has to work as an office temp just to make ends meet. In her spare moments, she scribbles away at country music lyrics and dreams of a career in Nashville. And all the while, she still obsesses over what Tom is doing, even to the point of carrying on elaborate fantasy conversations with the \"other woman.\"But just when Polly thinks she's finally ready for social life as a newly single woman, her eighty-two-year-old grandmother drops in for a visit - and then decides to stay, disrupting the whole household. Something even more surprising is waiting right outside Polly's front door, although it's not quite what she thought she was hoping for....Banished from the home they fashioned together, Tom is actually more present than he ever was before. Guilt and renewed faith have brought him back to the house he spent so much time away from. But Polly, driven by her own longing and confusion, turns away from home - to her first brave but hesitant steps toward a freedom that might only be an illusion, then to the arms of a familiar stranger, finally and inevitably to the rich heritage she has almost forgotten, the country music of her early years. With her grandmother as a constant reminder of her Oklahoma childhood, Polly's lyrics begin flowing from her troubled heart - sometimes revealing more about living and loving than she knows, but always taking her back to a past she barely remembers and forward to a present she is only now beginning to understand.Filled with the small truths that hit close to home, Sweet Remedy is a rueful and funny account of the painful lessons of domestic life and love, where the bitter mixes with the sweet in surprising proportions. As her ornery grandmother stubbornly forces a mysterious inheritance on her, Polly slowly comes to realize that the heart often knows what the mind doesn't. And when a stalker who has pursued her for weeks brings fear and then shocking violence into her home, Polly finds the strength not just to survive but to heal - herself and her family. A good dose of her grandmother's secret remedy evokes in Polly and Tom memories of a past too rich to discard and a future too full of unexpected passion and promise to jeopardize.",

Food and fiber may be grown indoors in giant bacteria baths, partially eliminating the farmer and the soil for the first time in history. Animal and human cloning could be commonplace, with \"replication\" increasingly replacing \"reproduction.\" Millions of people could obtain a detailed genetic readout of themselves, allowing them to gaze into their own biological futures and predict and plan their lives in ways never before possible. Parents may choose to have their children gestated in artificial wombs outside the human body. Genetic changes could be made in human fetuses to correct deadly diseases and disorders and enhance mood, behavior, intelligence, and physical traits.The new genetic commerce raises more troubling questions than any other economic revolution in history. Rifkin explores these and many other critical issues in this book about the coming era.",

He's been cohabiting with Ashley since college, and is caught in the dilemma of whether to break up with her or give in to marriage. Meanwhile, Ashley's efforts to earn a graduate degree seem futile considering that her diploma has taken up residence under the sofa cushions. Stuck in dead-end jobs; weary of commercial, corporate, and parental influences; searching for their own identities; Ashley, Craig, and the other characters of our noise find refuge in the brash world of indie rock, thrift stores, coffee houses, zines, and cheap beers. There are Eileen, who ends up in Kitty, Virginia, by accident and forgets to leave, and the members of Bottlecap, Kitty's hometown band, trying to decide whether to sell out and go to the West Coast or continue in the life of a small band. Chipp and Randy start a zine as a way to get their blood flowing for the first time even as Dave, the struggling founder of Violent Revolution Records, works as a waiter to fund his record label.  Funny, realistic, perverse, our noise captures the lives, loves, and record collections of a thrift-store-clothed group of twentysomethings trying to make their way in a real world that is nothing like what they expected.",

Here, she reviews the latest scientific research and shows, contrary to popular belief, that children of working mothers turn out just as well as those raised by stay-at-home mothers.

Isn't it lovely?\" His mother's exclamations barely penetrated Toshi's mind: he was already floating away on a never-ending love affair with Audrey and the culture she so exquisitely personified.Growing up in a tiny fishing village, Toshi spent troubled nights sleeping between his parents, rolling back and forth from his father, smelling of soy sauce and beer, to his mother, sweating green tea and miso. But he never understood the root of his mother's dark sadness, nor why, since the day she left them to live on her own, his father wouldn't talk about it.For Toshi, now twenty-three and fresh from living above his father's noodle shop, Tokyo is a strange and exciting place. The busy metropolis overwhelms him and American influence is everywhere; establishments such as Let's California Beer Garden and Fly Sexy Snack Bar abound. An illustrator for the popular comic strip Chocolate Girl, Toshi enrolls in classes at the Very Romantic English Academy. His glamorous teacher, Jane, lures him into an obsessive sexual relationship that disturbs yet intrigues him. But it takes a frightening incident played out under a blossoming cherry tree in Aoyama Cemetery to convince him that something's not entirely right with Jane...Then there's Paul, the big, red-haired copywriter who becomes Toshi's best friend. With his palatial apartment and insatiable appetites, Paul seems to symbolize America itself - a land so expansive it spills over into the rest of the world. When he goes bar hopping in Tokyo's gay district, Toshi gladly accompanies him, lending a sympathetic ear to Paul's laments about being dumped by yet another Japanese boyfriend. And Toshi, tentatively, begins to talk about Lucy, the enchanting composer with the beautiful neck. She seems to like Toshi, but maybe he's just misreading American signals - again.",

Mrs. Lindbergh was in her nineties and had been rendered nearly speechless years earlier by a series of small strokes that also left her frail and dependent on others for her care. As an accomplished author who had learned to write in part by reading her mother's many books, Reeve was deeply saddened and frustrated by her inability to communicate with her mother, a woman long recognized in her family and throughout the world as a gifted communicator.  No More Words is a moving and compassionate memoir of the final seventeen months of Reeve's mother's life. Reeve writes with great sensitivity and sympathy for her mother's plight, while also analyzing her own conflicting feelings. Anyone who has had to care for an elderly parent disabled by Alzheimer's or stroke will understand immediately the heartache and anguish Reeve suffered and will find comfort in her story.",

Hewitt includes material targeted to people of faith when appropriate and appeals to all readers who consider themselves conservative or center-right.The recklessness of our leaders on security and many other crucial issues has never been clearer, and acting in response to that recklessness has never been so urgent.

In his brilliant and startling new novel, Jonathan Kellerman, perennial bestselling author and premier proprietor of the psychological thriller, gives a sharp and timely twist to homicide's central question.Someone has murdered euthanasia champion Dr. Eldon Mate--a self-styled Dr. Death responsible for scores of assisted suicides. In a burst of bloody irony, the killer chooses to dispatch the doctor in the back of Mate's own suicide van, hooking him up to the killing apparatus dubbed \"the Humanitron\"--and adding some butchering touches of his own. The case is assigned to veteran LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis, who turns, once again, to his friend Dr. Alex Delaware. But working this case raises a conflict of interest for Alex so profound that he can't even discuss it with Milo. The tension that develops between cop and psychologist further complicates an already baffling and complex murder investigation--one whose suspects include the families of Dr. Mate's \"travelers,\" Mate's own son, and a psychopathic killer who relishes the geometry of death. Dr. Death is a rich brew of unforgettable characters, labyrinthine plotting, page-turning prose, and the unique insights into the darkest corners of the human mind that have earned Jonathan Kellerman international accolades as the master of psychological suspense.",

        "Authors": "By Blackthorn, John",
        "Description": "In an era when embassies, army bases, and entire skyscrapers are blasted into rubble in an apocalyptic instant, this tense story of vengeance run amok is an introduction to the twenty-first century and is as newsworthy as it is nerve rattling. A sophisticated thriller in the spirit of Graham Greene, it is informed by geopolitical savvy and a storytelling talent that reveals how the Cold War's most dangerous episode was far from resolved in 1962.Set on the eve of the Cuban revolution's fortieth anniversary celebration, Sins of the Fathers adds a chilling coda to the Cuban missile crisis as an American historian finds himself caught in a race against the clock between the Cold War past he's studying and a catastrophic act of urban terrorism whose seeds were planted almost four decades earlier.A purely academic project swiftly turns personal as subtle hints concerning dual mysteries accumulate at the edge of Professor McLemore's consciousness. Who is the elderly man glimpsed in Havana's rare shadows? Why does Sam Ramsay of the U.S. Interest office take such a special interest in an unassuming history professor? What could McLemore's radiant interpreter, Trinidad Santiago, have to do with Cuban State Security? And if McLemore's father left his wife and young son bound for Cuba in April 1962, why did he never return?As the sins of their fathers are visited on the sons and daughters of Cuban missile crisis veterans, McLemore discovers the missing piece of a deadly thirty-seven-year-old puzzle in Cuba's dusty archives. But he doesn't know where that crucial piece fits, and those who might be able to tell him have too many state secrets to conceal. After four decades of assassination attempts, disinformation, and dirty tricks on all sides, the CIA and the Cuban State Security Department aren't about to trust each other. As the timer ticks inexorably toward New Year's Day, 1999, both sides face a life-or-death decision--cooperate or perish.",

        "Title": "Global Embrace: Corporate Challenges in a Transnational World",
        "Authors": "By Wendt, Henry",
        "Description": "The emergence of transnational corporations is one of the most far-reaching and controversial transformations under way in the world today. Yet transnationals - often confused with the old-style multinationals they are rapidly displacing - are often barely understood, even by the people they most directly affect.Now comes Global Embrace, a lucid guide to the global village that addresses not only the interplay of markets and competitive strategies but moves beyond narrow business concerns to explore the challenges this new corporate form poses to employees, managers, shareholders, political leaders, and citizens everywhere.Henry Wendt, the chairman of SmithKline Beecham, has spent his entire career in international business. The announcement by Smith-Kline, a distinctly American maker of pharmaceuticals and health care products, and Beecham, a British company in similar lines of business, of their friendly merger on April 12, 1989, represented the largest cross-border merger ever, and created at a stroke the kind of enormous transnational corporation that is changing the face of global competition. Who better, then, than Henry Wendt to describe the transnational world he has helped bring into being?Taking a penetrating look at the nature and impact of transnationals, Wendt describes the hard work that faces companies making the leap to transnational status. He provides valuable models of transnational strategy, organizational behavior, and operating structure, and he shows how to combine them to create superior transnational performance. He examines the perplexing issues of internal governance and external regulation raised by these vastly influential organizations. And he asks - and answers - the tough questions that trouble ordinary citizens.He also offers a provocative look at the contradictory elements that make up the emerging transnational world. On the one hand, increasingly global standards of quality, performance, and behavior threaten to produce a single, homogeneous world. On the other, the last two decades have seen a vast upsurge in ethnic, cultural, and regional assertiveness around the world, usually at the expense of the nation-state. Paradoxically, argues Wendt, it is the very emergence of the transnational world that encourages local diversity and, for the first time, makes such diversity economically feasible. Bringing together all these strands of business strategy, global economics, and political policy, Wendt envisions a future in which \"tribes and transnationals\" are held together in a mutual global embrace that will utterly change the world of business - and the business of the world.",
