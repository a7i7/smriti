        "Description": "A savagely smart, darkly comic literary debut, New World Monkeys exposes the false idols of marital tranquillity, small-town idyll, and corporate Darwinism in the dazzling voice of a major new talent. Duncan and Lily, young and adrift in a prickly marriage and lackluster careers, flee Manhattan for the peaceful allure of a recently inherited crumbling Victorian home. But the two are left with little time to ponder the traditional \"he said, she said\" failings of a relationship: On an upstate road miles shy of their house, a wild boar leaps to his death in front of their Saab\u2013an accident whose consequences will haunt them throughout the summer. That was no ordinary hog.Lily and Duncan arrive in the eccentric town of Osterhagen to discover the boar had a name: The Sovereign of the Deep Wood. That it was the town mascot. And, as the hapless urbanites are coerced into the vortex of tea socials, cannon fire, and communal history, they realize that the residents of the bizarre hamlet intend to seek justice for their fallen hero.  Next come the bones. Duncan, an adman whose controversial new campaign could make or break his career, wants a temporary escape from the pressures of urban life. But his pastoral retreat darkens when an attempt at gardening turns up a human femur in the lawn, a headstone inscribed simply Tinker, 1902, and a sense that Lily\u2019s family may have violence in its aristocratic blood.  And then there\u2019s Lloyd. Lily, conflicted about her marriage and her career, spends her days at the local library researching her impossibly arcane dissertation topic but can\u2019t seem to make any progress. One day she observes the town pervert in action and befriends him.Lloyd, a Peeping Tom, invites her to follow him on a bird\u2019s-eye tour of Osterhagen that may help her home in on her own flaws and failings.Keep digging.Thrown together in their complicity over the boar\u2019s death, fueled to exhume Tinker\u2019s bones from the garden, and inspired by Lloyd\u2019s philosophical savoir faire, Duncan and Lily begin to excavate the profound truth about themselves and their marriage. But how deep can the two dig before the summer\u2019s violent beginning catches up with them?",

Wealth management expert Kenneth Solow takes a fresh look at the investment industry's reliance on Buy-and-Hold investing, exposing the flaws and potential dangers of this investment approach in secular bear markets.  Patiently waiting for stocks to deliver historical average returns does not rise to the level of an investment strategy, according to Solow, who recommends a different approach called Tactical Asset Allocation. A provocative and thoughtful critique of the current state of the money management industry, Buy and Hold is Dead (AGAIN) is an invaluable investment guide for our financially challenging times.",

Meanwhile, Pitt\u2019s supervisor, the formidable Victor Narraway, finds himself accused of embezzling government funds. With Pitt incommunicado in France, Narraway turns to Pitt\u2019s clever wife, Charlotte, for help.

This is the reason that up until now, diets have only had a 2% success rate. Tired of saying, \"I can&#39;t do this!\" when looking at diet programs? Then let Dr. Colbert help you take advantage of the latest medical breakthroughs that show you how to work with your body, rather than against it to lose weight easily and keep it off for life. Forget the old diets that work against you. With Dr. Colbert&#39;s diet, you can say, \"I can do this!\"As a medical doctor, Don Colbert deals every day with getting verifiable results that prove a patient is on his or her way to long-term health, not just fixing an immediate problem. And that is what this book is about. Far from being a diet, this program offers principles that are meant to last for life, principles that have been proven to work for thousands of individuals for more than a decade and counting. Dr. Colbert helps readers:Learn the top five reasons why diets failExplore several fundamentals of weight lossOvercome specific roadblocks to weight loss including insulin resistance, neurotransmitter imbalance, hormonal imbalance, and inflammationDesign a program catered just for them, including snacking, cooking, eating out, shopping, supplements, and much more",

        "Title": "Running Training Like a Business: Delivering Unmistakable Value",
        "Authors": "By Van Adelsberg, David and Trolley, Edward A.",
        "Description": "Many of today's business leaders champion learning as essential to business success, backing their belief with massive investments in Training and Development (T&D). In fact, T&D investments reach $56 billion per year in the U.S. alone. In this era of unprecedented opportunity, the time is right for T&D to become a full-fledged \"player\" in the world of business. At issue, the authors contend, is T&D's inability to seize this opportunity and deliver unmistakable value to its most influential customers-the exectuvies who pay for trainiing services but are unable to see clear business value being returned on their companies' training investments. The authors also contend that T&D must alter the traditional precepts that keep it \"separate form the business\" and \"out of the loop\" strategically. Van Adelsberg and Trolley suggest that the key to delivering unmistakable business value lies in transforming T&D-in spirit and in practice-from a funciton to a business. The authors draw on their experiences working inside Moore Corporation, DuPont, Mellon Bank, Kaiser Permanente, Texas Instruments, and other top businesses to illustrate how \"Running Training Like a Business\": 1. Eliminates the many hidden costs of training; 2. Re-focuses T&D from delivering training content to addressing business issues; 3. Makes T&D a full stategic partner in business decision making; 4. Ensures that training measurement is \"baked in, not bolted on\"; 5. Improves the effectiveness and efficiency of internal and/or external T&D organizations. Trolley and van Adelsberg lead the reader through a proven four-step process for transforming traditional training organizations into training enterprises capable of delivering unmistakable value, quarter after quarter and year after year.",

Disguising herself as a eunuch named Anastasius, Anna moves freely about in society, using her skills as a physician to manoeuver close to the key players involved in her brother\u2019s fate. With her medical practice thriving, Anna crosses paths with Zoe Chrysaphes, a devious noblewoman with her own hidden agenda, and Giuiliano Dandolo, a ship\u2019s captain conflicted not only by his mixed Venetian-Byzantine heritage but by his growing feelings for Anastasius.Trying to clear her brother\u2019s name, Anna learns more about Justinian\u2019s life and reputation\u2014including his peculiar ties to Bessarion\u2019s beautiful widow and his possible role in a plot to overthrow the emperor. This leaves Anna with more questions than answer, and time is running out. For an even greater threat lies on the horizon: Another Crusade to capture the Holy Land is brewing, and leaders in Rome and Venice have set their sights on Constantinople for what is sure to be a brutal invasion. Anna\u2019s discoveries draw her inextricably closer to the dangers of the emperor\u2019s treacherous court\u2014where it seems that no one is exactly who he or she appears to be.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Richly detailed and finely wrought, The Sheen on the Silk is a bold and brilliant work that affirms Anne Perry\u2019s talent as a master storyteller.",

        "Description": "In Hamlet, when the melancholy prince kills Polonius, the dramatic tension is enhanced by the audience's knowledge that Polonius lurks behind the curtain, and that Hamlet will mistake him for his detested stepfather.  Though this tension is understood and appreciated by readers of the play, its dynamics of raw intensity are perhaps best understood by the interplay between performers and audience members.  By addressing both enthusiasts of theater and enthusiasts of dramatic literature, Thaiss and Davis demonstrate how one's understanding of drama is enriched by critical attention to both performance and text.  It specifically addresses the writing needs of a novice playwright, not in conjunction with \"writing about literature,\" but about the play as subject in its own right.    This book provides critical analysis of play texts, as well as performance reviews, theater history research, and other examples that enliven understanding and promote versatility.  In its sequence of chapters, it addresses projects of increasing sophistication, from performance reviews and play analyses to theater history research and dramatic theory papers.  As a general guide to good writing, this book also promotes learning and critical/creative thought.  Introductory chapters cover the principles of good writing and offer strategies to help readers overcome writer's block, organize effectively and avoid common usage and style pitfalls.    Anyone interested in drama and/or literature.",

An incisive and spirited portrait of the twentieth century\u2019s wiliest political survivor and his fiefdom, Cuba Confidential is the gripping story of the shattered families and warring personalities that lie at the heart of the forty-three-year standoff between Miami and Havana.Famous to many Americans for her cover stories and media appearances, Ann Louise Bardach has been covering Cuba for a decade. She\u2019s talked to the crooks, spooks and politicians who have made history, and to their hired assassins and confidants. Based on exclusive interviews with Fidel Castro, his sister Juanita, his former brother-in-law Rafael D\u00edaz-Balart, the family of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, the friends and family of the legendary American fugitive Robert Vesco, the intrepid terrorist Luis Posada Carriles, and the inner circles of Jeb Bush and the late exile leader Jorge Mas Canosa, Cuba Confidential exposes the hardball take-no-prisoners tactics of the Cuban exile leadership, and its manipulation and exploitation by ten American presidents.Bardach homes in on Fidel Castro and his cronies, taking us closer than we\u2019ve ever been\u2014and on the militant exiles who have devoted their lives, with CIA connivance, to trying to eliminate him. From Calle Ocho to Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s kitchen table in C\u00e1rdenas, from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to Union City to Washington, D.C., Ann Louise Bardach serves up an unforgettable portrait of Cuba and its exiles.",

        "Authors": "By Wetzel, Dan and Haskins, Don",
        "Description": "Timed to the release of Jerry Bruckheimer's movie, the moving autobiography of Hall of Fame basketball coach Don Haskins and his storied team of players, the Texas Western MinersIn 1966, college basketball was almost completely segregated. In the championship game for the NCAA title that year, Don Haskins, coach of the then little-known Texas Western College, did something that had never been done before in the history of college basketball. He started five black players, and in the now legendary game, unseated the nationally top-ranked University of Kentucky. Broadcast on television throughout the country, the Miners victory became the impetus for the desegregation of all college teams in the South during the next few years.Now, for the first time, Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins tell his story. Beginning as a small-town high school basketball coach, Haskins was known for his tough coaching methods and larger-than-life personality. As a child growing up during the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma, he developed a strong set of values and discipline that he would instill in his players throughout his coaching career. With recollections from his former players, including those of the 1966 team, along with Haskins's own Seven Principles for Success, Glory Road is the inspiring story of a living legend and one of the most respected coaches of all time.With a foreword by basketball legend Bobby Knight, and coinciding with the release of the film Glory Road, the story of Don Haskins and his championship team is sure to become a classic for sports fans and historians.",

        "Title": "Seeds of Terror: How Heroin Is Bankrolling the Taliban and al Qaeda",
        "Authors": "By Peters, Gretchen",
        "Description": "Most Americans think of the Taliban and al Qaeda as a bunch of bearded fanatics fighting an Islamic crusade from caves in Afghanistan. But that doesn't explain their astonishing comeback along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Why is it eight years after we invaded Afghanistan, the CIA says that these groups are better armed and better funded than ever?Seeds of Terror will reshape the way you think about America's enemies, revealing them less as ideologues and more as criminals who earn half a billion dollars every year off the opium trade. With the breakneck pace of a thriller, author Gretchen Peters traces their illicit activities from vast poppy fields in southern Afghanistan to heroin labs run by Taliban commanders, from drug convoys armed with Stinger missiles to the money launderers of Karachi and Dubai.This isn't a fanciful conspiracy theory. Seeds of Terror is based on hundreds of interviews with Taliban fighters, smugglers, and law enforcement and intelligence agents. Their information is matched by intelligence reports shown to the author by frustrated U.S. officials who fear the next 9/11 will be far deadlier than the first--and paid for with drug profits.Seeds of Terror makes the case that we must cut terrorists off from their drug earnings if we ever hope to beat them. This war isn't about ideology or religion. It's about creating a new economy for Afghanistan--and breaking the cycle of violence and extremism that has gripped the region for decades.",
