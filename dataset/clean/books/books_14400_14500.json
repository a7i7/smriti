Though Lily is a tentmaker - an ordained priest who makes a living outside the church - she is an old hand at filling in for parishes that are temporarily without a rector.Soon after Lily takes over the job however, she begins to suspect both the official version of the priest's death and those who insist on its truth. As she relentlessly pursues the deadly secrets hidden deep within the heart of the parish, Lily discovers that she may pay for her role of truth-seeker with her own life.",

        "Title": "Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital",
        "Authors": "By Lankford, Nelson D.",
        "Description": "Through the winter and early spring of 1865, while Union armies ranged at will across the South, Richmond still glittered witht the hard defiance of a city long at war. But this last flicker of resolve only made the city's fall all the more devastating. By the morning of April 2, Gen. Robert E. Lee's command had been corroded by desertion, and the forces of his opponent were growing daily. Lee could no longer hold the line of forts and trenches that guarded the Confederate capital. To save his army, he had to retreat. To avoid capture, the government needed to abandon the city that night. Faced with the inevitability of Grant's triumph, Jefferson Davis and his cabinet fled, leaving Richmond to its fate - looting, fire, capture, and the end of hope for a southern nation.As the last southern soldiers left at dawn on Monday, they fired tobacco warehouses and all the bridges across the river. A rising wind spread embers of destruction over the rooftops. When the Union army marched in, it found the city ablaze. To an eyewitness, the sun shone through the thickening smoke \"like a great beacon of woe, or the awful unlashed eye of an avenging Deity.\"For staunch Confederates, for local Unionists who opposed them, and for the liberated slaves, the city's fall turned the world upside down. In their grief and despair, and their stubborn, sometimes violent resistance to reunification, the vanquished Confederates could not have known that the conquest of Richmond heralded the birth of the modern United States of America.In this book, Nelson Lankford draws upon a treasure trove of diaries, letters, memoirs, and newspaper reports to create a narrative of novelistic immediacy that relives the experiences of the men and women, both black and white, who witnessed these tumultous events that convulsed their city.",

Now Wiltse brings Becker back in a thriller that breaks all the rules and takes the reader to the edge.The Edge of Sleep reunites John Becker with FBI agent Karen Crist, his former protegee and ex-lover. Crist is at her wit's end: little boys are disappearing, only to turn up murdered at an alarming - and increasing - rate. The killer is in free-fall: out of control, desperate, unchecked.What Becker and Crist don't suspect is that the murderer in no way fits the standard serial-killer profile. So even when they come face to face with the guilty, neither Becker's instincts nor Crist's training puts them any closer to breaking this chilling streak of crime. Before they come close to unmasking the killer, they will themselves become not so much the hunters as all-too-easy prey.Fast-paced and hard-driving, The Edge of Sleep is a brilliant novel of the hunter and the hunted that secures Wiltse's reputation as a writer who can keep readers up all night.",

Now the story continues, as the passionate and talented children of Damia and Afra Lyon confront the alien threat first detected by their grandmother the Rowan.Laria, Isthian, Rojer, and Zara Lyon share aspects of the telepathic, empathic, and telekinetic powers that have marked their family for generations. But as the family expands, it is clear that not all talents are alike: each of the four young Lyons has a very personal kind of ability. When they join forces together, as will be required to destroy the deadly Hiver aliens, their powers and their deep family bond make them the most powerful fighting force the Human and Mrdini races can create.And the peaceful races of the universe need every ounce of power that the Lyon clan can muster. The Hivers' own world has been destroyed by a sun gone nova, which has left them in search of a new home. The Hivers are a logical race, and their approach to finding this home is straightforward: when they locate a world that seems suitable, they destroy all life on it in preparation for Hiver occupation.The Lyons have seen the devastation the Hivers are capable of causing, and they understand all too well that the time has come to move into space in pursuit of this deadly enemy. None of them welcomes war, but the blackened worlds the Hivers leave behind are a powerful statement of its necessity. When the time comes, they will be ready with the full force of their power.",

She just wishes she were. She's been living with her widowed father, Gabriel, a practicing sorcerer. But Gabriel has discovered hitherto-unknown magical secrets that can bring their possessor great riches, absolute power, and forbidden knowledge.

There, grieving and lonely, she places a personal ad, looking for a pen pal with whom she can discuss botany. Little does she know that she's actually placed an ad in Play Plant magazine, and that her new pen pal, Herb, thinks she's interested in romance.Meanwhile, an ambitious wizard has learned of the existence of Spring's secrets.

But the novel's first sentence hints of mysterious revelations to come: \"There are at least a dozen errors here.\"Step by step, the book's narrator - himself mysterious - sets about correcting the errors, investigating the deceptive but appealing Wesley Sultan by way of the lives he touched and often manipulated: his wives, his siblings, his girlfriends, his children. Each chapter reprints the obituary but each time with a new handwritten amendment - correction piling upon correction until the original has been effectively demolished. It seems that businessman Wesley - handsome, dapper, flirtatious, and ambitious - lived a far more tangled and ambiguous life than the one he presented to the world.A Few Corrections is both a psychological detective story and an epitaph for a vanishing figure - the gallant, sports-car-driving local Romeo who flourished in midcentury throughout small-town America. Written with humor and lyrical dash, it is also a compelling novel that explores its subject with wit and a flowering tenderness.",

Together, she and her human must unravel a veritable cat\u2019s cradle of ambition, greed, and murder at the center of which waits a killer with the most tangled of motives.CATCH AS A CAT CANSpring has come to the Blue Ridge Mountains, and spring fever to the tiny town of Crozet. As the annual Dogwood Festival approaches, romantic maneuvers are rampant.

As for Mrs. Murphy, her interest in the exploding bird population is intensified by Pewter\u2019s discovery of a dead rare woodpecker near the back porch. Feline intuition tells her more mysteries lie ahead. And they do. A case of stolen hubcaps seems relatively straightforward until the truck that transported them to the unsuspecting O\u2019Bannon brothers\u2019 upscale salvage yard turns out to be completely untraceable. And while everybody deplores the tipsy, raunchy behavior of young mechanic Roger O\u2019Bannon, nobody is sure it accounts for his sudden death over a sobering cup of coffee. But when his brother Sean will not authorize an autopsy and presses on with preparations for the Wrecker\u2019s Ball, the climax of the season\u2019s junketing, people start to whisper.Then, as violent thunderstorms sweep in from the west to shadow spring festivities, another death occurs\u2013could it be murder?

        "Title": "Longaberger: An American Success Story",
        "Authors": "By Shook, Robert L. and Longaberger, Dave",
        "Description": "Dave Longaberger was one of the most remarkable entrepreneurs of his generation. His vision, his unorthodox business methods, and his belief in people resulted in the creation of one of the largest and most successful private companies in America.Longaberger: An American Success Story is Dave's fascinating firsthand account of how he created and grew his company into the largest basket manufacturer in the United States, employing thousands of people, revitalizing his community, and inspiring everyone involved with a commitment to quality, craftsmanship, and a unique management philosophy.As Dave himself admits in this moving and compelling memoir, he was an unlikely success story. In addition to having epilepsy and a stutter, Dave suffered from a learning disorder, finally graduating high school at the age of twenty-one. Yet, he ran two profitable businesses, a restaurant and a grocery store -- which, to the horror of bankers and friends, he then sold in order to finance his struggling basket company.Dave was a business maverick who only let adversities make him stronger and more versatile. He became renowned for his managerial skills -- and his sense of humor. More than once he started a food fight at a company event or launched a wild idea -- like the basket-shaped headquarters building -- that just happened to work perfectly.This engaging story shows how Dave Longaberger shared his life and unconventional business sense to create what is now the $1 billion-in-sales Longaberger Company. Join him on his journey as he takes his own unique route to success. Learn about the many original and highly unusual management practices that not only contributed to the strength of the Longaberger enterprise but can make any business run more profitably. Follow Dave's example and develop the entrepreneurial skills necessary for business success.Longaberger: An American Success Story is an affirmation of the American values of independence, hard work, and business ethics. Inspirational as well as informative, this is a moving portrait of an enterprise and an entrepreneur, both of whom are loved and revered by the thousands of people whose lives they have enriched.About The Longaberger CompanyFrom a bare-bones beginning with a handful of part-time employees in 1972, Longaberger today, under the leadership of president and CEO Tami Longaberger, employs some 8,700 people and inspires some 70,000 independent sales associates across the United States. The Longaberger Company has a sprawling campus of office facilities, production plants where basket makers create more than 40,000 high-quality baskets every day, and tourist attractions in and around central Ohio.",

Random House will be donating all its profits to Project Recovery OKC, Inc., to benefit the victims of the bombing and their families.In Their Name is a moving tribute to those who died in the disaster and a compelling narrative of the rescue efforts. Much of the book is in the words of the survivors, their rescuers, the families of those involved, doctors and other medical staff, and children.The stories here go far beyond any news account of the outrage. They document in vivid detail how people behaved in the crisis. Who converged on the Federal Building in the first minutes after the explosion, what did they find, and how did they respond to the appalling sights?The Reverend Billy Graham has contributed a foreword, and there is an epilogue from Governor and Mrs. Keating, who led their city and state with great fortitude and sensitivity in its ordeal. Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor, from the Great Plains himself, has written about his own remarkable experience reporting from Oklahoma City.",
