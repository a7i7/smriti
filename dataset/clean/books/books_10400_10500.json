        "Description": "Ronald Reagan's political career and his status as a cultural icon have been observed from every angle, but his role as a father to his daughter has been seen only in the harsh light of Patti's well-publicized tensions with Nancy Reagan. But now Patti Davis has reconciled with her mother and the catalyst was Angels Don't Die. In fact, her parents were so touched by the book they have contributed introductory comments. Angels Don't Die is a moving tribute to Ronald Reagan's spiritual strength and offers an intimate portrait that will appeal to people everywhere who admire the Reagans as well as to anyone contending with the challenges of parent-child relationships.Putting aside past hurts and misunderstandings, Patti Davis writes lyrically of the lessons she learned from watching her father cope with the various crises in his life. She writes of his forgiveness of John Hinckley, Reagan's would-be assassin, and of his near-death experience following surgery. She reveals Ronald Reagan to be a simple, quietly heroic man whose faith in God has never wavered.",

        "Description": "They have wielded enormous financial power and dominated world politics for more than half a century. They have been appointed to positions of great power and have been elected as governors, congressmen, senators and presidents. They have shaped our past and, with our country at war under the leadership of their number one son, they are, more critically than ever, shaping our future.As the Bush family has risen to dominance, so too they have been master orchestrators of their own public image, acting and operating under the shield of privacy their money and status have always afforded them. Until now.Number One bestselling author and investigative biographer Kitty Kelley has closely examined the lives of Jacqueline Onassis, Nancy Reagan, Frank Sinatra, and the British Royal family. Now the First Lady of unauthorized biography reckons with the first family of the United States\u2014and the result is at once a rich and shocking history and a very human portrait of the world\u2019s most powerful dynasty.An important work on wealth, power, and class in America, The Family is rich in texture, probing in its psychological insight, revealing in its political and financial detail, and stunning in the patterns that emerge and expose the Bush dynasty as it has never before been exposed. Ms. Kelley takes us back to the origins of the family fortune in the Ohio steel industry at the turn of the last century, through the oil deals and international business associations that have maintained and increased their wealth over the past hundred years. The book leads us through Prescott Bush\u2019s first entr\u00e9e into government at the state level in 1950s\u2019 Connecticut, to George Herbert Walker Bush\u2019s long and winding road to the White House, to his son\u2019s quick sweep into the same office. Along the way, we see the complex relationships the Bushes have had with the giants of the century\u2014Eisenhower, Nixon, Joseph McCarthy, Kissinger, Reagan, Clinton\u2014as well as the often ruthless methods used to realize their goals.Perhaps most impressive\u2014and surprising\u2014is the way the book delves behind the obsessively protected public image into the family\u2019s intimate private lives: the matriarchs, the mistresses, the marriages, the divorces, the jealousies, the hypocrisies, the golden children, and the black sheep.At a crucial point in American history, Kitty Kelley is the one person to finally tell all about the family that has, perhaps more than any other, defined our role in the modern world. This is the book the Bushes don\u2019t want you to read.  This is The Family.",

Then whatever their ages, now is the time to teach them the money skills they will need every day of their lives.Neale S. Godfrey is not onlyan expert in family finance but also a parent who puts her advice to work in her own home.Chairman of the Children's Financial Network, mother of two, and a frequent commentator on national television, Godfrey has designed a unique program for kids -- from those as young as three to those in their teens -- that teaches them how to earn, save, and spend money wisely while it lets parents clearly communicate their family's values.

Do you give her the money? Your five-year-old wants an allowance. Should he get it if he doesn't do his chores? Your daughter's best friend is going to Florida on vacation.How do you explain why your family can't go? What and why do you kids need to know about your finances?  For parents who want to teach their kids the value of money and personal values, there's no better guide than Money Doesn't Grow On Trees.",

You could say BALLS is the story of a coach's kick-off, his first, second, and third downs . . . and his punt. But BALLS is a coach's story that belongs to the coach's wife. To her, and to his mother, his mother-in-law, his daughter, his assistants' wives, his players' mothers and girlfriends, and even his players' grandmothers. It's the women standing behind this handsome football hero who tell the story behind the headlines of Mac Gibbs, Birmingham University coach Catfish Bomar's star quarterback, who married Dixie Carraway, the beautiful homecoming queen. Set in Alabama, home state of the legendary Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, BALLS is told by fifteen women and one little girl touched by Mac Gibbs's fall from fame as a college quarterback to infamy as head coach of the Birmingham University Black Bears. It's told in those women's voices, from their seats in the stands. They watch the other women, worry when players are slow to get up off the ground, pray when players are carried off on stretchers. They don't care much for the \"science\" of the game--or its brutality. They see football as it really is--sexy, dirty, sweaty, painful, empowering, corrupt. The story they tell is often funny and not always pretty, as the view from deep inside rarely is. This is a novel that moves with the force of a fourth down charge, and shimmers with the tears of the women waiting outside the locker-room door when the game is lost. The author, twice a head coach's wife, knows whereof she writes so brilliantly. She also knows a lot about love. And BALLS is, above all, a love story.",

        "Description": "In this debut story collection\u2013the first by a woman who served in Vietnam\u2013 Susan O\u2019Neill offers a remarkable, unprecedented glimpse into the war from a female perspective. All the nurses who served there shared a common bond: to attend to the wounded. While men were sent to protect America\u2019s interests at any cost, nurses were trained to save the lives of anyone\u2013soldier or citizen, ally or enemy\u2013who was brought through the hospital doors. It was an important distinction in a place where killing was sometimes the only objective. And since they were so vastly outnumbered, women were both revered and sexually craved.For these women and the men among whom they worked and lived a common defense against the awful onslaught of dead and dying, wounded and maimed, was a feigned indifference, the irony of the helpless. \u201cDon\u2019t mean nothing\u201d became their mantra, a small bunker in the real war\u2013the war against total mental breakdown. Powerful, provocative, and often wonderfully funny, each of these tales offers new and profound insight into how the war in Vietnam forever changed the lives of everyone who served there. \u201cBroken Stone\u201d is an astute look at the relinquishing of faith and the sacredness of sex. The tremendously touching \u201cButch\u201d is a story of love, loss, and the native casualties of war. And the darkly hilarious \u201cMonkey on Our Backs\u201d follows the escapades of a much-maligned and detested pet primate who causes one Lieutenant so much grief that she asks a Marine to kill it. But like the cat that came back, the monkey remains\u2013a reminder that taming a jungle is an exercise in futility. A moving contribution by a woman to the literature of Vietnam, Don\u2019t Mean Nothing is eye-opening and unforgettable. Here is a book that enlarges our understanding of the American experience in Vietnam",

Now in paperback, Profiles in Courage for Our Time pays tribute to 13 such heroes in the same spirit as the original collection. Some of our greatest writers have brought their formidable talents to this celebration of modern political bravery including Michael Beschloss, Anna Quindlen, Bob Woodward, and Marian Wright Edelman. Also included is Caroline Kennedy's profile of the latest award recipient, Kofi Annan. These are just a few of the luminaries who eloquently and passionately record the experiences of the award winners. This celebration of modern political bravery demonstrates that heroism among today's elected officials is as possible and inspiring as ever. \"The Profiles in Courage Award seeks to honor those whose lives of service prove that politics can be a noble profession. We hope that Americans realize that there are men and women serving at all levels of our government who are legends of our time.\" --Caroline Kennedy",

I'm deeply moved that Oprah Winfrey has selected this novel for Oprah's Book Club, a family novel presented to Oprah's vast American family.\"--Joyce Carol OatesMoving away from the dark tone of her more recent masterpieces, Joyce Carol Oates turns the tale of a family struggling to cope with its fall from grace into a deeply moving and unforgettable account of the vigor of hope and the power of love to prevail over suffering.The Mulvaneys of High Point Farm in Mt. Ephraim, New York, are a large and fortunate clan, blessed with good looks, abundant charisma, and boundless promise. But over the twenty-five year span of this ambitious novel, the Mulvaneys will slide, almost imperceptibly at first, from the pinnacle of happiness, transformed by the vagaries of fate into a scattered collection of lost and lonely souls.It is the youngest son, Judd, now an adult, who attempts to piece together the fragments of the Mulvaneys' former glory, seeking to uncover and understand the secret violation that occasioned the family's tragic downfall. Each of the Mulvaneys endures some form of exile- physical or spiritual - but in the end they find a way to bridge the chasms that have opened up among them, reuniting in the spirit of love and healing.Profoundly cathartic, Oates' acclaimed novel unfolds as if, in the darkness of the human spirit, she has come upon a source of light at its core. Rarely has a writer made such a startling and inspiring statement about the value of hope and compassion.",

Multiple Sclerosis covers all the latest information on how to control the symptoms of the disease -- including thorough discussions of the roles of stress, diet, and pregnancy -- along with providing an analysis of the current treatments and of all the latest medical breakthroughs. Also covered are:  * The diagnosis (including the revolutionary process of magnetic resonance imaging) * The varying symptoms and courses of the disease * The emotional problems that can come with MS and how to cope with them  Whether you've just been diagnosed as having MS or you've lived with it for a while, or even if the person with MS is someone you know and love, you should know that misinformation is a far greater enemy than the disease. So though Multiple Sclerosis doesn't provide you with a cure, it can give you the best tool to beat MS -- the facts.",

The project is designed to contain nuclear waste for ten-thousand years, the amount of time it will take for the waste to no longer be radioactive. It is an ambitious project, especially in light of the fact that in this century alone we lacked the foresight to anticipate Y2K. Given this daunting responsibility, the project employs an artist, a botanist and an architect to contribute visual warnings to the site, in a manner decipherable to future generations. Conrad imagines an influential poetry professor who insists that the project also include a poem, a great poem, an epic poem. It is this poem that brings us to the center of an extended circle of minor poets who are continually upstaging, back-stabbing and falling in and out of love with one another. Set against the vibrant backdrop of Chicago, this is a story of science and poetry, manipulation and intrigue, and the lengths to which people will go for their passions.",

        "Title": "Remember This Time",
        "Authors": "By Broder, Bill and Broder, Gloria Kurian",
        "Description": "Based on research, oral history tapes and interviews, Remember This Time recreates Western Russia during the First World War and Bolshevik Revolution through the powerful, yet intimate story of the Chodorov family from 1914 through 1919. At the center is Kala, the second oldest of four daughters, a patriotic and spirited sixteen year old when the novel begins, a young woman characteristic of the hardworking, energetic life of the times, devoted and proud of her family, her traditions, and her home town of Lyesk. As war escalates and the Russians enforce a scorched earth policy, Kala's beloved Lyesk--in the midst of what was known as the Pale of Jewish Settlement--is destroyed. Against her mother's wishes, she becomes a refugee, joins her Russian countrymen on their retreat into Great Russia while her sisters and parents hide in the woods to await the advancing German armies and plan to rebuild their burnt-out home under the new government. With drama, humor; care for historical detail, and a story-telling magic, the authors make one feel so close to the people of the time that it is like hearing the story of one's own family. They follow Kala on her grueling march, during her love affair and marriage to a young revolutionary and during their life together in Moscow as civil war erupts. They show her disillusionment with the new socialist people's government and describe her eventual return to Lyesk, where she is witness to the town being ruled and victimized successively by the Germans, the Poles, the Bolsheviks, and, once again, the Poles. They share the intimacies of the Chodorov family life, including small and great moments of happiness and tragedy. Throughout, we see how the family's loyalties are challenged, their endurance tested, and finally understand why they choose to flee the home they love. Ultimately, the Chodorovs epitomize the dilemma of the world split apart by rival ethnic and national clalins, representing that generation of immigrants who came to America in the twenties full of dreams and anger.",

        "Description": "With an enchanting blend of magical realism, politics, and romance reminiscent of her classic bestseller The House of the Spirits, Isabel Allende presents a soul-baring memoir that seizes the reader like a novel of suspense.   Written for her daughter Paula when she became ill and slipped into a coma, Paula is the colorful story of Allende's life -- from her early years in her native Chile, through the turbulent military coup of 1973, to the subsequent dictatorship and her family's years of exile. In the telling, bizarre ancestors reveal themselves, delightful and bitter childhood memories surface, enthralling anecdotes of youthful years are narrated and intimate secrets are softly whispered.   In an exorcism of death and a celebration of life, Isabel Allende explores the past, questions the gods, and creates a magical book that carries the reader from tears to laughter, from terror to sensuality to wisdom. In Paula, readers will come to understand that the miraculous world of her novels is the world Isabel Allende inhabits -- it is her enchanted reality.",
