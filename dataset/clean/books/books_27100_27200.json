Colonel Evan Burton, has the courage and the local experience to track down Kelly Trost.

        "Description": "You don't have to believe in God in order to experience God. -- Deepak Chopra The best-selling author of Ageless Body, Timeless Mind and The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success has written his most ambitious and important work yet -- an exploration of the idea that everyone can have the direct experience of divinity. According to Chopra, the brain is hardwired to know God. The human nervous system has seven biological responses that correspond to seven levels of divine experience. These are shaped not by any one religion (they are shared by all), but by the brain's need to take an infinite, chaotic universe and find meaning in it. As we make sense of the swirling \"quantum soup,\" we inevitably find the face of God. In this remarkable book Chopra shows us how. And along the way we delve into such mysteries as religious awakening, ecstasy, genius, telepathy, multiple personality, and clairvoyance -- all parts of the \"mind field\" that quantum physics discovered almost a hundred years ago. This invisible place, although it appears to be an empty void, is actually the womb of creation. Here God is our co-creator in the constant process of self-creation that is life itself. As we come to know God better, we gain direct access to healing, love, and miracles. How to Know God is Deepak Chopra's writing at its very best, an internationally celebrated blend of philosophy and science applied to the greatest subject of all. This is the quest each of us is on, whether we realize it or not. For, as Chopra writes, \"God is our highest instinct to know ourselves.\" This book makes a dramatic and enduring contribution to that knowledge.",

As he delivers the address, Diaz is strangely captivated by what he sees, recognizing in the couple's behavior something of himself. Later, he discovers that Edith has left the hall without her purse - and he sets out to find her. From that moment, Edith and Andrew are drawn into the world of Diaz, his wife, and his campaign, a world they find increasingly seductive and disorienting.As the novel moves from New York to Mexico City, where the Diazes have their home, to the maquiladoras, cantinas, and strip clubs of Ciudad Juarez at the border, we watch these lives becoming entwined in ways none of them can see clearly. An \"exotic\" dance in the back room of a cantina; a do-or-die battle for the presidency; a bungled assassination; the shooting of a Mexican boy as he scales a border wall to the United States; and the legacy of Montezuma and Cortes, the Aztec and the European, converge as \"a culture that has calculated the exact year of its erasure collides with one that thinks it's the wrath of God.\"",

Drawing on period cookbooks, literary biography, letters, and memoirs, Deval weaves Pomme's tale in an unusual blend of fiction, and literary and culinary anecdote.Through food, Pomme explores love and romance, anger, greed, ambition, solitude, and art. Her ardent inquiry, which deliciously uncovers nearly 100 recipes associated with writers, includes polenta (Lord Byron sailed down the Grand Canal in Venice with his lover while nibbling polenta that she warmed between her breasts), Charles Dickens' own recipe for champagne punch as well as Evelyn Waugh's peppered champagne, biscuits Tortoni (the ice cream mousse favored by Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo at Tortoni's Cafe in Paris), Emily Dickinson's gingerbread, Virginia Woolf's cottage loaves, and more.Reckless Appetites is made with the perfect ingredients for all who love romance, literature, and food.",

        "Description": "Introduced by John Updike and published in America for the first time, The Haunted Major recounts a golf match of epic proportions between adversaries. In this uproarious tale about human conceit and the supernatural, Major the Honorable John William Wentworth Gore, an English gentleman of sublime self-esteem, challenges crack golfer Jim Lindsay to a game for the chance to propose marriage to Mrs. Gunter, a beautiful American millionairess. Although \"Jacky\" Core, the narrator, alleges to be a marvelously accomplished sportsman, he has never set foot on a fairway and has only seven days to learn to pitch, putt, and drive the course like a veteran.To prepare for the match, which is to take place on the fictitious St. Magnus links in Scotland (based on the Old Course at St. Andrews), Gore secretly hires a coach and transforms his hotel room into a golf studio, outfitted with turf, a moveable hillock, a bunker, and specially padded walls to absorb drives. Gore is set to win or lose like a gentleman when the revengeful ghost of a Scottish cardinal with some odd-shaped clubs materializes, adding an otherworldly twist to the story.This new edition, with John Updike's spirited introduction and Harry Furniss's humorous original illustrations, fixes The Haunted Major in the uppermost tier of sports classics.",

        "Description": "For most of the millions of Americans who go afield in pursuit of game in the 1990s, a hunt is about so much more than the act of hunting. It\u2019s also about connecting to the land, bonding with your hunting companions, and respecting the spirit of the chase. The core of the hunt, the very reasons that people go afield, is the same today as it was in 1900. Tradition. And tradition is what this book is about. A striking collection of stories and artwork, this is a celebration of our hunting heritage that\u2019s sure to evoke your own special hunting memories. \"100 Years of Hunting\" includes compelling stories about hunting game from the ever-popular whitetail to mule deer, elk, grizzly bear, bighorn sheep, grouse, ducks, pheasant, and more from the past 100 years. These engaging narratives are from such legends as Grover Cleveland, Zane Grey, Archibald Rutledge, Gordon MacQuarrie, Patrick F. McManus, Ernest Hemingway, and Robert Ruark. These hunting tales are paired with great artwork, including outstanding wildlife photography, hunting collectibles, sporting paintings, period ads, and historical images.",

        "Authors": "By Pincus, J. David and Debonis, J. Nicholas",
        "Description": "This book isn't like any business book you've probably ever seen. Part novel, part how-to, it's a totally gripping exploration of a vital message in an age of change: that the ability to communicate and collaborate can make or break an executive career.People at the top are under fire as never before, a fact keenly illustrated by the saga of Arlen Burch Royster. The CEO of Royal Accommodations, a national hotel chain, Royster has just learned that renegade managers have been cooking the company books. Not surprisingly, the world is about to learn it at the same time. Suddenly Royster has investigations to make and plenty of explaining to do - to his staff, board of directors, stockholders, employees, the media, the government, and all the others who seem to be hungering for his scalp. It's a new level of pressure for someone who clings to the vestiges of the \"me boss, you worker\" era, but this CEO's future - and perhaps the very existence of his company - hinges on his response.Royster is a fictional figurehead, but his crises are all too real. And that's where the balance of this extraordinary book comes in. Lead author J. David Pincus has researched matters of leadership and communication among executives in the Fortune 500 for the past ten years. His findings are interspersed throughout the episodes of Royster's story, adding detail to this exploration of corporate leadership. Here, too, are one-on-one exclusive interviews with America's actual \"top dogs\" - including Tom Clausen (Bank of America), Hicks Waldron (Avon), Walter Williams (Bethlehem Steel), Sandy Sigoloff (Wickes Companies), Henry Rogers (Rogers & Cowan), and Dick Schlosberg (The Los Angeles Times) - who describe how leaders must adapt to new realities in the workplace and marketplace.At the heart of Top Dog is a four-part model for all managers who recognize the growing importance of communication and relationship-building. Through case studies and anecdotes, it illustrates the leader's need for consistency (the need for credibility), compassion (the need to be empathetic and responsive), organization (the need to integrate strategies and tactics), and selectivity (the need to limit and focus communication).A fascinating blend of the \"real\" and the \"realistic,\" Top Dog chronicles the evolution of the CEO as facilitator and communicator. It will captivate everyone with a stake in corporate leadership and its rapidly changing nature.",

But privately he struggles with the knowledge that he has never recaptured the depth of intimacy he had with his first wife, Jitka, who died suddenly and young.On the day that his mother dies, a beautiful married stranger comes to hear him preach. As their relationship reintroduces him to the intimacy he knew with his lost Jitka, Daniel finds his heart reawakening. But their affair will lead him to betray everything he has lived for: his family, his vocation, and his future. Set in a Czech Republic in the throes of complete social and economic upheaval, the order that had underpinned Daniel's life falls apart, his intimacy with God splintered by that which he has found with another man's wife.",

Rose, the older, more practical one, is a widow who lives in New Mexico and has two ungrateful kids, a bored dog, and a horse with a bad back. Lily, the younger, more daring sister, lives in Southern California, where she has put her career before everything else\u2014including love. Lily and Rose flee to their parents' ranch, for some emotional detox. But the two haven't spoken in five long years, and spending time togther is the last thing they'd planned on. Nor had either anticipated being so actively pusued by lovestruck men. Readers will be in their corner all the way as they rediscover the bonds of sisterhood and slowly open their hearts to love.",
