        "Title": "FOR THE LIFE OF YOUR DOG: A Complete Guide to Having a Dog From Adoption and Birth Through Sickness and Health",
        "Authors": "By Louganis, Greg and Siino, Betsy Sikora",
        "Description": "Four-time Olympic gold medalist Greg Louganis triumphed with his #1 New York Times bestselling autobiography Breaking the Surface. That heartfelt, revelatory book would not have been complete without the loving portrayals of his protectors and closest friends: his dogs. Now Greg, a breeder and trainer of Harlequin Great Danes, has teamed up with award-winning animal writer Betsy Sikora Siino to create an extraordinary guide to dog ownership that overflows with insight, intelligence, and compassion. With the same winning spirit he brought to world-class diving, Greg embraces the challenges and joys of living with dogs -- and shares his incredible bond and insider's knowledge that has produced best-of-breed winners. His distinctive philosophy illuminates every page of this special volume that keeps the dog's best interests in mind throughout every phase of life -- as puppies, in their prime, and in the final years.  In matters of choosing a new dog, basic care, and specific health and behavioral concerns, Greg tells owners where to be tough (on sales contracts), where to be accommodating (with blind and deaf dogs) and everything in between. Passionate in his opinions and wonderfully effective, Greg includes:   Cures for chewing, barking, biting, and other so-called behavior problems Answers to the great housetraining disputes including the pros and cons of crating Specific feeding programs for optimal nutrition -- and for combating the greatest health threat to your dog: obesityAn exercise program for the canine athlete (and they're all athletes!)Training tips for obedience, showing, and search-and-rescuePreventive medicine, common illnesses from nose to tail, and age-related concernsAdvice on breeding, whelping, adopting your second (third, fourth...) dogs, and more!   Woven throughout are Greg's moving stories of his own dogs, such as his beloved Dane Ryan, who taught him to communicate with a dog who couldn't hear, and the hardships of saying goodbye to Donna, whose early death broke his heart.  For The Life of Your Dog is an inspiring and eye-opening reference. Delivered with Greg's delightful candor, his sound advice makes it a classic for new and long-time dog owners -- and anyone who has ever loved a dog.",

What about family and friends?-- How can I be sure we talk about adoption enough, but not too much?Whether parents adopted traditionally, as stepparents, or through donor insemination, surrogacy, or in vitro fertilization, Making Sense of Adoption will open the door to a lifetime of growth and understanding for adoptive families.",

        "Authors": "By Kinder, Gary",
        "Description": "In one of the most exciting adventure stories of our time, Gary Kinder combines maritime disaster with visionary underwater technology. In September 1857, the SS Central America, a side-wheel steamer carrying passengers returning from the gold fields of California, went down during a hurricane off the Carolina coast. It would be the worst peacetime disaster at sea in American history, claiming more than 400 lives and 21 tons of gold. In the 1980s a maverick engineer named Tommy Thompson set out to find the wreck of the Central America and salvage its treasure from the ocean floor. With nail-biting suspense, Kinder reconstructs the terror of the Central America's last days, when passengers bailed sea water from the hold, then chopped up the ship's timbersto use as impromptu life rafts before being cast into the sea themselves. He goes on to chronicle Thompson's epic quest for the lost vessel, an enterprise marked by hair-raising weather, the hostility of the deep ocean at 8,000 feet, highly experimental technology, and unscrupulous rival treasure-hunters. The result is a magnificent tale, filled with heroism, entrepreneurialism, and perseverance.The entrepreneur describes his efforts to locate the ship which sank off the coast of the Carolinas in 1857, carrying more than four hundred people and twenty-one tons of gold",

        "Title": "Condi vs. Hillary: The Next Great Presidential Race",
        "Authors": "By Morris, Dick and McGann, Eileen",
        "Description": "Who will be president in 2008? Many believe that the White House is Hillary Clinton's to lose. As long-time strategists Dick Morris and Eileen McGann reveal in Condi vs. Hillary, however, Hillary's plans for higher office are vulnerable to a challenge from a most unexpected quarter: the Bush administration's secretary of state and former national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice.Rice is the only figure on the national scene who has the credentials, the credibility, and the charisma to lead the GOP in 2008. And, as this first book on the subject demonstrates, a race between these two commanding, but very different, women is a very real possibility -- and would inevitably prove one of the most fascinating and important races in American history.Blending insider insight and political foresight, Condi vs. Hillary surveys the strengths and weaknesses of the two candidates, finding persuasive clues about what we might expect from each of them as a chief executive. It traces their very different childhoods -- Hillary Rodham's in unchallenging suburban comfort, Condi Rice's in Birmingham, Alabama, during the civil rights era -- and finds in each the roots of their latter-day selves. It explores their career in public life -- Hillary's as an ambitious liberal who attached herself to a governor on the rise, Condi's as a woman of broad and deep talents who has earned her own way. It turns a discerning eye on how each has spent her time in government, contrasting Condi's growth and maturation in office with Hillary's record of underachievement as both first lady and senator from New York. And it reveals how a draft-Condi movement could sweep the secretary of state into the presidency even as she forgoes campaigning to address her responsibilities as secretary of state.America, in short, may be on the verge of a perfect storm of twenty-first-century politics, pitting two of America's most popular -- and controversial -- women against each other, and offering Americans a choice between fulfilling the ambitions of one of our most polarizing figures . . . or changing history by electing not just the first woman, but also the first African American woman, to lead the free world into the future.",

        "Authors": "By Barnet, Richard J. and Barnet, Ann B.",
        "Description": "Drawing on insights from recent advances in neuroscience and psychological research, The Youngest Minds offers a new look at how children learn language, establish emotional ties, gain control of their own emotions, and embrace moral values. The authors discuss recent research and theory about the effects of early experience on the physiology of the brain. They show how a child's genetic inheritance and experiences interact at many different levels. The capacities for language, emotional development, and moral understanding are inborn, but they are fine-tuned by human relationships that influence the landscape of the brain.  The Youngest Minds explains how parents and other caregivers support the intertwined processes of language, intellectual, and emotional development with the experiences they provide for a baby. Through daily interactions, infants establish ways of responding that will influence them all their lives.  The preschool years are critical in the lives of children because their brains are developing more rapidly than at any other time in life. In these years, children are especially dependent on parents and other primary caregivers to meet their needs for love, security, stimulation, and challenge. The Barnets describe how children learn to control their anger, consider the feelings of others, assimilate the standards of acceptable behavior in their family and culture, and develop moral sensibilities.  Using studies that follow groups of children over many years, the authors explain how an accumulation of risks in early years can lead to serious trouble in adult life. But they also present research demonstrating that many children overcome great odds. The Youngest Minds outlines the essential characteristics of a good caregiving environment. Whether a child is cared for at home or at a day care center, certain conditions need to be met. Because of many changes in our society over the last few decades, families are finding it harder to provide the unstressful but challenging environment that much scientific evidence indicates babies need. The authors conclude with a look at who is taking care of America's young children and offer some ideas for improving the quality of their care.",

        "Title": "A DARKER SHADE OF CRIMSON (Ivy League Mysteries)",
        "Authors": "By Thomas-Graham, Pamela",
        "Description": "Being young, gifted, and black at Harvard has always been difficult. For Rosezella Maynette Fisher, outspoken sister girl and controversial Dean of Students at Harvard Law School, it was murder.  And the debonair new President of Harvard is a prime suspect.  A Darker Shade of Crimson is a novel about how Ella Fisher ended up dead on the first day of the fall semester, and how her friend Veronica (Nikki) Chase -- a smart, ambitious, attractive, and well-connected black economics professor -- sets out to solve the crime, and in the process uncovers some of Harvard's most deeply buried secrets.  At twenty-eight, Nikki is a rising star, the only black professor in Harvard's economics department. After stumbling over Ella Fisher's body during a blackout in a classroom building, she is quickly plunged into the investigation of her death. With the occasional tip from Raphael Griffin, a Harvard policeman, Nikki learns that plenty of people could have wanted Ella dead. There is the new Harvard President Leo Barrett, whose rise to the top Ella helped engineer. Before her death, many thought Ella was Leo's lover. Now he's looking perpetually exhausted and guilty. Did they have a fatal falling out? Or did Leo's high-society Brahmin wife, Victoria Wolcott Barrett, kill Ella to stop the affair? Perhaps the sleek university comptroller, Christian Chung -- whom Nikki comes to suspect is the leader of an embezzlement scheme that Ella uncovered just before she died -- did the deed. Or it could have been the Chairman of the Economics Department and Nikki's mentor, Ian McAllister, who suddenly seems to have unlimited cash. Finally, there's Ella's radical Afrocentric ex-husband Isaiah Fisher, who Nikki discovers was holding a long-buried secret over Ella's head.  Only two people seem to mourn Ella's passing: her blue-blooded, Wellesley-educated secretary, Lindsey Wentworth; and Ella's best girlfriend, Alix Coulter, an actress from Texas with attitude. With their help, Nikki sets out to unravel simultaneously the mystery of Ella's death and the complications of her own love life.

        "Description": "We are in San Francisco: Ricardo Arias is found dead in his apartment, the gun that killed him wedged in his mouth. The physical evidence might confirm suicide, but there is no doubt that it strongly suggests murder. The police investigation quickly uncovers a maze of emotion and conflict that surrounded the dead man in the last months of his life: an estranged wife, Terri Peralta; an ugly custody fight over their six-year-old daughter, Elena; threats of extortion; accusations of adultery; and sexual abuse of the child.And then the police uncover a murder suspect.He's Terri's new lover, Christopher Paget, a man of wealth and prominence, an extremely high-profile San Francisco defense attorney. Paget has motive - it's his son accused of abusing Elena, his personal and political plans for the future put at risk by the dead man's accusations - and his alibi is dangerously threadbare.Now, defense attorney becomes defendant. Now Paget's defense attorney, Caroline Masters - an equally high-powered lawyer and former judge - works desperately to raise reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury, even as Paget and Terri struggle to preserve their future and that of their cherished children. But as the trial progresses, we begin to see that what comes to light in the courtroom may be fatefully intertwined with what threatens to remain hidden: by Paget's refusal to testify on his own behalf, by Elena's tangled loyalties, and by Terri's inability - or unwillingness - to recall the details of her own childhood trauma.",

With Dixie City Jam, the writer USA Today called \"the Grisham Alternative\" enters the front ranks of contemporary fiction writers . . . and mainstream bestsellers.They're out there, under the salt - the bodies of German seamen who used to lie in wait at the mouth of the Mississippi for unescorted American tankers sailing from the oil refineries of Baton Rouge out into the Gulf of Mexico. As a child, Dave Robicheaux had been haunted by the sailors' images; then, as a young college student, he'd accidentally discovered one of their subs while scuba diving. Years later, in a New Orleans populated by desperate hustlers and millennium-watchers of all stripes, Robicheaux, a detective with the New Iberia sheriff's office, finds himself and his family at serious risk, stalked for his knowledge of a watery burial ground by a mysterious man named Will Buchalter - a man who believes that the Holocaust was one big hoax. American crime fiction's \"finest prose stylist\" (Los Angeles Times) is at the peak of his powers in Dixie City Jam as he looks long and deep into the human heart of darkness.",

In time she fulfilled that belief by becoming the first woman governor of Vermont. Throughout her career, Kunin found that the rules for women politicians were different: she would not be forgiven (nor would she forgive herself) for neglecting her family. She could not afford to display emotion at the wrong times lest she be thought \"weak.\" And she would have to learn to play political hardball with the best of them while keeping her integrity.In Living a Political Life, Kunin-who is now Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education-takes a frank look at the challenges that confronted her as she tried not just to succeed in politics but to set a precedent for other women. In doing so, she illuminates both what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a public servant and gives us a memoir as thoughtful and revealing as any to emerge from the corridors of power.",

The Lady of the Lake and her Fey people are creatures of power and mystery, a people to leave to their own devices. But it is equally frightening for young Niviene to leave the familiar safety of the Fey forest and venture into the world of humans - into Camelot - when Merlin, her mentor, requires her help in saving Arthur's kingdom.All the major Arthurian figures are in this wondrous tale: Arthur, Merlin, Morgan, Mordred, Lancelot and Gwenevere.

Some mysteries have no answers -- like why an airplane falls out of the sky, and why the woman you love was onboard that flight. When unfathomable tragedy strikes Boston private investigator John Francis Cuddy, all he can do is begin to grieve. There's no revenge. No perp. And no cure except time.  But when Cuddy is jarred by a call for help from an old Vietnam-era comrade, time is a luxury he can't afford. Cuddy goes because he has to. And what he finds in Fort Lauderdale is a tragedy that rivals his own: a proud vet brought down by a stroke, searching for his granddaughter's killer.  The girl was found dead in Colonel Nicolas Helides' heavily guarded mansion on the Intracoastal Waterway. Thirteen years old and far from innocent, Veronica Helides was hardly protected by her family's wealth. Used by her own father to revive his music career and the fortunes of a band named Spiral, Veronica had been molded into a sexually provocative rock starlet. By the time someone drowned her at her grandfather's birthday party, murder was merely the last crime committed against her.  Now Cuddy is picking apart a cast of players in the life of Colonel Helides and the granddaughter everyone called \"Very.\" From Helides' younger, depressive son to former groupies; from a mysterious spiritual advisor to the woman who married the colonel for his money and the license it would buy her, Cuddy is seeing the worst of human nature at a time when his own heart is broken in two. If that were not enough, the killing of a precocious victim may not have been the isolated act it first appeared.  In a powerful and mesmerizing novel of uncontrollable love, rage, and loyalty among families and friends, John Francis Cuddy isn't just trying to catch a killer -- he's trying to stop himself from free-falling into the ultimate human darkness.",

How can we apply to our own lives the lessons learned during this extraordinary time? In The Measure of Our Days, Jerome Groopman, an eminent physician, explores these central human questions through portraits of eight patients who have gazed into the face of death.The unforgettable individuals we meet here include Kirk, an aggressive venture capitalist who refuses to accept his fate and insists on the mega-gamble of risky kidney cancer treatments; Elizabeth, an imperious dowager with a rare blood disease, who is humbled by the fear of becoming helpless; Alex, an accomplished but emotionally unfulfilled architect, who begs for help in dying at the first icy touch of AIDS; and Elliott, who, in his triumph over leukemia, finally creates for himself a definition of success.Through the eyes of a generous and compassionate physician, each individual's experience is transformed from a medical case study into a spiritual journey of questioning and self-awareness.",

Years later, the brothers\u2019 bond remains so strong that it transcends the normal boundaries separating life and death. Charlie St. Cloud lives in a snug New England fishing village.  By day he tends the lawns and monuments of the ancient cemetery where his younger brother, Sam, is buried.  Graced with an extraordinary gift after surviving the accident, he can still see, talk, and even play catch with Sam\u2019s spirit.  But townsfolk whisper that Charlie has never recovered from his loss.Into his carefully ordered life comes Tess Carroll, a captivating, adventuresome woman training for a solo sailing trip around the globe.  Fate steers her boat into a treacherous storm that blows her back to harbor, to a charged encounter with Charlie, and to a surprise more overwhelming than the violent sea itself. Charlie and Tess discover a beautiful and uncommon connection that leads to a race against time and a desperate choice between death and life, between the past and the future, between holding on and letting go.Luminous, soulful, and filled with unforgettable characters, The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud is one of those rare, wise books that reveal the mysteries of the unseen world around us, gently transforming the worst pain of loss into hope, healing, and even laughter.  Suspenseful and deeply moving, its startling climax reminds us that sometimes tragedies can bring about miracles if we simply open our hearts.",

The background of the tragedy is here: the history of bad blood and broken treaties between the Sioux Nation and the United States, the underlying reason for Custer's expedition and for the convocation of Indians on the Little Bighorn that particular year. The author's analysis of Custer's motives and political ambitions sheds new light on an old mystery and will be hotly disputed by the general's admirers.",

        "Description": "This is a different kind of art history survey, more for individual interest than the classroom, in which 10 senior scholars in Britain and the U.S. write lengthy essays introducing the basic art history of major time periods from classical to contemporary and then, by way of illustration, choose 10 or 12 of their favorite works from that period. These follow the essay in full-page, high quality color plates with a full page of facing commentary, which has a strong focus on formal analysis. Annotation c.

        "Description": "\"One Adam Twelve, One Adam Twelve: We've got an APB on a young male, black coat with white highlights, flashing eyes that reflect light at night, and a long, sleek tail. Aliases include 'Kitty, Kitty, Kitty' and 'Stormy.' Armed with sharp claws and should be considered extremely dangerous . . .\"Officers Reed and Malloy would certainly be interested in some of the sneakiest beasts to ever roam the metropolis, aka the Feline Felons. Bad cats, after all, are the current rage, and this book has the rap sheet on all the unusual suspects. Author Debbie Keller knows a bad kitty when she sees one. Her uncompromisingly funny book pairs candid photos of cats caught in the act with clever descriptions of their crimes. Even the occasional, \"Is this the face of a cat who would toss a guinea pig out a window?\" protestation crops up, too. This cat patrol blotter of feline crimes includes reports such as:Prowler-A midnight prowler was reported in the vicinity of garbage cans on trash day. Police artists have released this composite silhouette: Suspect is a middle-aged male, brown hair, yellow eyes, stocky build, 91/2 inches tall. Answers to the name of \"Here Kitty\" or the sound of an opening can. Adorable kitty cats do more than sleep in the sun. They're resting up after a night of no good . . . and Feline Felons has \"Just the facts, ma'am.\"",
