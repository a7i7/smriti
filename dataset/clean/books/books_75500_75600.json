Meanwhile, he must juggle the ambitions of his sexy actress girlfriend with his own soaring celebrity. Written in the tradition of the scandalous tell-all biography, WALKING MAN satirizes so-called \"alternative\" culture while it fondly recollects the 80s and 90s zine scene. \"I loved this book from its first page. WALKING MAN tells an extremely funny story and is spot-on in its critique of pop culture trendiness\"--Joseph Weisberg.",

When a colleague suddenly dies, he is entrusted with the investigation and soon finds himself entwined in the most intimate knowledge of judge Valerio Garau's life - from his rich, orphaned childhood with its hints of scandal to the red-and-blue capsule with its grain of cyanide that one morning caused him to fall backward among the cafe tables while joking with his mistress.Was Garau's death suicide, mistake, or murder? His ex-wife or his mistress, his priestly uncle or his blind aunt, his colleagues or his lover's illustrious and influential husband: all of these could be suspected of wanting to free themselves of him. And who was Judge Garau? A cynic, a seducer, a liar, a naif? The investigator must reconstruct a life from the people and effects left behind: yellowed photographs of distant carnivals, archeological finds collected for who knows what passion or pretext, stolen letters, forced locks, police chiefs, homosexuals, and schoolmistresses...",

        "Description": "Only a handful of doctors have been responsible for the health and well-being of presidents of the United States. This is the highly personalized story of T. Burton Smith, M.D., White House doctor to President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George Bush during two of the most eventful years in recent U.S. history.Dr. Smith was with President Reagan during his meetings with world leaders from Mitterand and Kohl to Gorbachev and Hirohito. He was rarely more than a few minutes away from the president and First Lady in the White House, Camp David, aboard Air Force One, or at their 688-acre ranch in California. He was in charge of the physical examination that discovered a \"white glistening polyp the size of a golf ball\" in President Reagan's colon - a growth which could have cost America's 40th president his life.The practice of medicine has changed beyond recognition during the past 350 years. Dr. Smith examines it from Washington's day, when a popular remedy was deer antler shavings, to the present with emphasis given to the four presidents who were assassinated - Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley and Kennedy. He argues that even with today's medical advances Lincoln and Kennedy would have died, but that Garfield and McKinley would have been back to work in the White House only a few weeks after they were shot.Dr. Smith also describes the incredible care surrounding the two most recent occupants of the White House - Ronald Reagan and George Bush. He explains how six pints of refrigerated blood accompanied President Reagan on every trip he took. How the president wore a bulletproof raincoat to a ceremony overseas at which the Secret Service thought he might be shot. How food served to the president is purchased by plainclothes security men driving unmarked cars who never shop at the sane store twice in a row. And how he gave Ronald Reagan and George Bush direct orders that he expected them to obey, which they did!While Dr. Smith's book reveals the panorama of care surrounding the well-being of the men who have occupied the White House and their immediate families, it's also filled with fascinating minutiae. What, for example, do you give the president and First Lady for Christmas (and what do they give you)? How powerful was Nancy Reagan's astrologer? What caused her to summon Dr. Smith to her White House quarters to tell him \"You don't talk!\"? And where is the only place in the world that the president of the United States can go for a walk all by himself?Never before has a White House doctor described in such intimate detail what it's like to look after the most powerful man on earth. This book fills that void.",

Kalami, her handsome, charming patient, transports her with him from Lake Superior to a dazzling world that seems like a dream.But if Isavalta is a dream, Bridget's new life is a nightmare. Caught in a magical crossfire between the powerful Dowager Empress, her daughter-in-law, and the sorcerers who serve their mistresses and other more subtle ends, she doesn't know whom to trust, whom to beware.With the fate of an empire at stake and her heart torn by conflicting desires, she becomes a reluctant player in a deadly game of politics and magic with rules as hard to untangle as the knots in a silken tassel or the threads of a woven rug.",

        "Title": "The Russia Balance Sheet",
        "Authors": "By Aslund, Anders and Kuchins, Andrew",
        "Description": "Russia has been on a wild roller-coaster ride for the past three decades with no end in sight. Just in the past year as the global financial crisis deepened, the conventional perception of Russia has changed from a \"safe haven\" from the economic tsunami to one of the hardest hit larger markets in the world. The Russia Balance Sheet provides comprehensive, balanced, and accurate information on all key aspects of Russia's developments and their implications for the United States and other nations. The book argues that, after the strained Bush-Putin years, the Obama administration must seize the initiative to define both its policy toward Russia and the agenda for the many multilateral meetings already planned.The book offers policy prescriptions for both the United States and Russia. It is imperative that the Obama administration establish an explicit Russia policy rather than subordinating it to other issues in order to enable the administration to make necessary tradeoffs and follow up on promises. An interagency group for Russia has been created under the leadership of the National Security Council's senior director for Russia; this group should determine the Russia policy and issue an NSC directive. As a new Russia policy is crafted and an NSC directive on Russia adopted, President Obama should make a public statement on his Russia policy. Ideally, President Obama would declare his determination to finally persuade the US Congress to graduate Russia from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. As for Russia, it should accede to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to secure its successful international integration and an improvement of its legal standards. The Kremlin needs to introduce transparent procurement procedures for major investments to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks. Property rights must be reinforced and renationalization stopped to ease the problems in banking and energy production. Finally, with the first full-scale summit between Presidents Obama and Medvedev to take place in Italy in July 2009, the authors argue that the two presidents should recommit to fulfilling the April 2008 Sochi Declaration and to reestablishing a broader organized cooperation mechanism between the two countries, like that of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, to promote action and accountability.",

        "Authors": "By Alexander, Max, Frasier, Clark, Gaier, Mark, and Kernick, John (PHT)",
        "Description": "Part how-to-garden primer, The Arrows Cookbook combines more than 150 delicious recipes with time-tested techniques for growing herbs, vegetables, and edible flowers in a book that reconnects us to the land and the seasons.  Cooking food from the backyard garden or farmers' market -- or even using herbs grown in pots in a sunny window -- goes beyond a passion for freshness. On an elemental level, the process reawakens the cook to a cycle of nature that our ancestors understood intuitively but that, for most of us, has been lost in the modern world.  When chefs Clark Frasier and Mark Gaier left northern California to open their dream restaurant in southern Maine, they had no intention of becoming culinary pioneers. But in 1988 in Ogunquit, Maine, finding enough fresh vegetables and herbs to power a sophisticated restaurant was indeed a challenge.  So, like all can-do Americans, they did something. A ragged field of witchgrass behind the restaurant was turned into a garden where they learned to coax a nine-month growing season out of the chilly earth. They built raised beds, saved seeds, researched heirlooms, consulted experts, and started seedlings.  Today, that acre of Maine yields 270 varieties of vegetables, herbs, fruits, and edible flowers that provide 90 percent of the produce served at Arrows. Born of great necessity, the garden is the soul of this destination restaurant.  In The Arrows Cookbook, Frasier and Gaier tell us how they do it, charting the timeless journey from seed to supper. Recipes celebrate each season -- Asparagus with Mizuna and Blood Orange Vinaigrette and English Pea Soup in spring; Grilled Antipasto Platter and Rib-Eye Steak with Herbs and Caramelized Onions on a summer evening; Napa Cabbage and Apple Cole Slaw and Roast Pork Loin with Rosemary and Garlic for fall; and Escarole and White Bean Soup and Winter Greens with Pink Grapefruit and Red Onion for the chilly, short days of winter. They also offer new takes on such New England classics as Boiled Dinner, Our Way to Steaming Lobster -- Southeast Asian Style, as well as a glorious Thanksgiving feast complete with Roast Turkey with Gravy.  The book is full of clear advice and instructions that will make you elegantly self-sufficient in both kitchen and garden: how to smoke a trout, preserve herbs, use raised beds to extend the growing season, make your own prosciutto, start seeds indoors, roast salmon on a plank, maximize garden space, freeze berries, select edible flowers, grow heirloom tomatoes, pickle hot peppers, find local farmers and fisherman for fresh meats and seafood, and more.",

        "Description": "\"Matheson slyly steers us toward consumer goods and services that minimize our earth-stomping human footprint. She's brave enough to say 'buy less of everything,' and even the politically fraught 'buy nothing.' Matheson's genius is to make this seem not only doable, but fun.\"- Elizabeth Royte, author of Garbage Land and Bottlemania Want to go green without giving up great style? Welcome to the world of Green Chic. Choosing to be green makes a real difference in the fight against global warming. But did you know that it's also hip, classic and stylish?Offering up dozens of author-tested, earth-friendly ideas, writer Christie Matheson reveals that being chic and saving the planet aren't mutually exclusive. Embrace the fabulousness of green living and you can: - Look gorgeous - Have a killer wardrobe- Feel amazing- Travel in style- Create a home that's an oasis- Host fun parties- Eat incredible food and drink phenomenal wine... All while feeling more connected to your friends, family and nature. (And did we mention that green women don't get fat?) Printed on recycled paper, with a portion of its proceeds going to a green cause, Green Chic is the perfect book for style-savvy readers with a green heart. Can living a chic green lifestyle TRULY make a difference to the planet? You bet your organic cotton sheets it can.Buying into the Green Chic movement doesn't mean you need to buy more stuff.Avoid products that purport to be green just for the marketing effect: \"organic\" processed foods; huge, gas-guzzling hybrid SUVs; clothes boasting that they're green just because they're made from \"natural\" cotton. Claiming to be green is trendy and companies out there are taking advantage. Don't believe all the hype.10 GREEN CHIC-AND EASY-WAYS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE- Ditch bottled water: refill a sassy thermos. - Pop little purchases in your purse, not a shopping bag.- Sip biodynamic wine.- Choose cashmere, not acrylic. - Let your hair air dry for a while before you blow dry: less frizz, less energy consumed.- Unplug (and put away) unsightly cell phone chargers.- Opt for quality over quantity in everything you buy.- Cut down on clutter.- Limit your consumption of anything packaged in plastic.- Support local designers.BUT REMEMBER:Don't go out and replace everything you own, from your makeup to your wardrobe to your furniture, with (theoretically) ecofriendly products. Being ecofriendly means consuming less, not more. Get in the habit of thinking before you buy. The best time to purchase ecofriendly goods is when you need them. That's when you're in a position to make a choice and express yourself as a green consumer.Being Green isn't a fad ... it's timelessly chic.",

Mysterious assaults on college students in Gothenburg?s parks are carried out in the dark of the night, while during the day toddlers are abducted from their nursery schools and quickly returned, seemingly unharmed, before anyone even notices they are missing. Investigating these bizarre cases, D.C.I.

Winter must deduce the labyrinthine connections between the cases before the culprit?or is it culprits??closes in on his own family.

Standing between Hitler and world domination was the just-appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill...and a few hundred pilots in the Royal Air Force's Fighter Command. Defeat seemed inevitable. Instead, a legend was born.  Taking its readers on a breathtaking journey from open lifeboats in North Atlantic gales to the cockpits of burning fighter planes, Finest Hour re-creates the tensions and uncertainties of the events of 1940 -- months when the fate of the world truly hung in the balance. It is a powerful account, told through the voices, diaries, letters, and memoirs of the men and women who lived and loved, fought and died, during that terrible yet ultimately triumphant year. The personal stories of these soldiers and airmen, diplomats and politicians, journalists and spies, are combined with a fresh and often controversial account of the swirling political intrigues and betrayals of the period.  A testament to a year when a nation's darkest hour became its finest, Finest Hour is a singular achievement and an indispensable contribution to the literature of World War II.",

        "Description": "National security, terrorism, and human rights\u2013these explosive issues lie at the heart of Stephen Frey\u2019s riveting new thriller, a high-octane novel of suspense, revenge, and intrigue. Dynamic chief financial officer Michael Rose is looking to add an exciting and profitable new dimension to energy conglomerate Trafalgar Industries via the major acquisition of CIS, a global information technology company. But it\u2019s far from a done deal, thanks to fierce resistance from CIS, and from certain members of Trafalgar\u2019s own board, to Rose\u2019s takeover proposal. But Rose isn\u2019t about to sacrifice his best shot at the score that could land him in the CEO\u2019s chair. While swiftly scaling the corporate ladder, Rose has played the big business power game expertly enough to know he has the moves to outmaneuver the opposition. But what Rose doesn\u2019t know is the truth about his latest adversaries at CIS\u2013that they are linked to an organization hell-bent on a twisted mission and are lethal to anyone who stands in their way. The Order, an ultra-secret shadow government agency, was founded by high-level administration officials in reaction to the assassination of President Lincoln. Nearly 150 years later, the group was galvanized anew by the worst act of terror ever perpetrated on American soil\u2013and pushed to dangerous extremes by the specter of fear . . . and the taste of power. The Order had always been sanctioned to manage national security at all costs, by any and all means, without consequences. But behind the sleek veneer of CIS Technologies, the fourth and newest incarnation of The Order not only maintains the ultimate nationwide surveillance and intelligence-gathering system, but conducts officially licensed covert operations rife with torture and murder\u2013all in the name of freedom. The mission cannot and will not be jeopardized, even if innocent lives must be sacrificed. Unfortunately Michael Rose doesn\u2019t yet realize that his hardball tactics have made him the Order\u2019s number one hard target, and his penchant for playing to win has brought him unwittingly into a deadly duel with an enemy more powerful than he can imagine. In a world where the rule is kill or be killed, Rose\u2019s rep for sealing deals might just seal his fate.",
