        "Authors": "By Greene, Bob and Fulford, D. G.",
        "Description": "Long lives yield many treasures: pictures, keepsakes, property, or savings, the standard currencies of inheritance passed on from generation to generation. But there is another precious legacy, one that is often lost: memories, the closely held images of people, places, and things that are the blueprint of a life. In To Our Children's Children, bestselling author and nationally syndicated columnist Bob Greene and his sister, journalist D. G. Fulford, have created an attractive and engaging guidebook that makes recording a personal hisrory as uncomplicated and easy as writing a letter.A brief introduction sets the tone of fond remembrance, followed by chapters of questions designed to elicit answers that will form the patchwork of a fascinating personal history. To Our Children's Children concentrates on the particulars of life, the basics, askng engaging questions that open the doors of memory, in chapters like \"The House of Your Growing Up,\" \"Everyday Life,\" \"Homefront,\" and more.To Our Children's Children invites us to wander the golden corridors of memory and create for our children and for future generations a written or spoken record that is the greatest gift we can hope to offer - our lives, our memories, ourselves.",

        "Title": "Customers As Partners: Building Relationships That Last",
        "Authors": "By Bell, Chip R.",
        "Description": "Astute managers and entrepreneurs already know that customer loyalty is a necessity for profitable businesses in the &apos;90s and beyond, and they have invested in this knowledge by initiating a wide variety of quality service programs intended to dazzle customers. But while providing dazzling service may tender short-term customer satisfaction, it is a costly and unsustainable approach. Long-term success depends on replacing the superficial transaction-oriented approach with the deeper commitment of partnership-the essence of a value-based approach to serving customers. Describing the qualities that embody this deeper commitment, Customers As Partners provides examples from the corporate world, small service businesses, and personal experience. Illustrating each key principle with anecdotes and stories, this book shows how all lasting business relationships share the same partnership attributes as a friendship or marriage, and how each is: o grounded in an attitude of generosity, o bolstered by a sense of trust, o propelled by a joint purpose or shared vision,  o served by honesty,  o characterized by a sense of balance, and  o infused with an element of familiarity and ease. Customers As Partners vividly shows how to achieve lasting success by creating sustaining personal bonds-the true source of a company&apos;s profitability. This ground-breaking work provides insights on how to keep the quality of these relationships central in every interaction. It offers a model of partnership where customers offer valuable feedback, support your business by recommending you to others, and forgive mistakes because they feel a reciprocal long-term commitment.",

Scenes from the lives of both the landed gentry and the impoverished working class offer a subtle but well-rounded perspective of social conditions in England during the late nineteenth century.Animal lovers of all ages will cherish this memorable story, now available in this unabridged, modestly priced edition.",

        "Description": "From patient advocate Mary Shomon, author of Living Well With Hypothyroidism, here is the first book to tackle the weight factors specific to thyroid patients and detail a conventional and alternative plan for lasting weight loss.An estimated 10 million Americans have been diagnosed with thyroid disease\u2014most of them women\u2014and for the majority of them, losing weight is mentioned time and time again as a primary concern and chief frustration\u2014a challenge made more difficult due to the metabolic slowdown of a malfunctioning thyroid gland. For these thyroid patients, treatment alone doesn't seem to resolve weight problems. Further, they may struggle with raising basic metabolism, resolving underlying nutritional deficiencies, treating depression and correcting brain chemistry imbalances, reducing stress, and combating insulin resistance.The Thyroid Diet will identify these factors that inhibit a thyroid patient's ability to lose weight, and offer solutions\u2014both conventional and alternative\u2014to help. It will discuss optimal dietary changes, including how a thyroid sufferer should focus on a low-glycemic, high-fibre, low-calorie diet, eaten as smaller, more frequent meals to balance blood sugar. The Thyroid Diet addresses the use of various herbs, nutritional supplements, and prescription weight loss drugs, outlining the necessity of exercise, and drawing together all information into an integrated diet and exercise plan. It contains several different eating plans, food lists, and a set of delicious and healthy gourmet recipes. With handy worksheets to use in weight loss tracking, and a special resource section featuring websites, books, and support groups, here is vital help for the millions of thyroid patients dealing with weight problems.Mary Shomon has been praised by doctors around the country for her medical knowledge and sensitivity to patients' needs. She will be receiving similar blurbs for this new book. There are no other books on controlling your weight problems if you have a thyroid condition, yet over 40% of overweight people have evidence of a thyroid condition, and the weight loss problems facing them are unique and need a specific approach.",

        "Title": "A History of the World in the Twentieth Century",
        "Authors": "By Grenville, J. A. S.",
        "Description": "This is the century of war and revolution, of communism, fascism, and nationalistic fervor, of empires crumbling and new orders arising, of technological explosion, mass communication, and, most of all, movement. Never has so much happened so quickly to so many. And never has this uniquely global century received the rich historical insight afforded by this book. This is global history on a grand scale, a full account of the twentieth century from its first days to our own.Drawing on inexhaustible reserves of energy and knowledge, the distinguished British historian J. A. S. Grenville tells a story as remarkable for its sweep and drama as for its deft attention to detail. From the economic fallout of Versailles to the emergence of Japan, from the Great Depression to the Spanish Civil War, from the Soviet threat to the Middle East Crisis, we see history unfolding here and encounter the forces and personalities that have transformed the world. Grenville paints clear, sharp portraits of great events and of key figures such as Churchill and Hitler, Kennedy and Khrushchev, Mao and Gandhi, Golda Meir and Margaret Thatcher. But he also stresses the underlying developments in health, finance, industry, warfare, and communication against which all individuals, movements, nations, and ideologies rose or fell.The twentieth century has seen human beings subjected to indiscriminate terrorism, state-sponsored massacres, and systematic extermination in concentration camps and killing fields. Grenville graphically renders the sufferings of individuals, as well as their triumphs in Tiananmen Square, in Eastern Europe in 1989, in Gandhi's India, in Martin Luther King Jr.'s America, in Mandela's South Africa, and even in the bomb shelters of Sarajevo. Richly illustrated with some 275 photographs, A History of the World in the Twentieth Century offers splendid testimony to the difference men and women have made and can make in shaping the course of the history of the world.",
