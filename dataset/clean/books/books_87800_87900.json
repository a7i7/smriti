Moreover, Python is easy to learn but powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programming challenges. But what Python programmers have lacked is one concise and clear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance in how best to use Python's great power. Now Python in a Nutshell fills this need.In the tradition of O'Reilly's \"In a Nutshell\" series, this book offers Python programmers one place to look when they need help remembering or deciphering the syntax of this open source language and its many modules.  This comprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up all the most frequently needed information--not just about the Python language itself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard library and the most important third-party extensions.Python in a Nutshell focuses on Python 2.2 (and all its point releases), currently the most stable and widespread Python release. This book includes:A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language itselfAn explanation of object-oriented programming in Python, covering both the classic and new-style object modelsCoverage of other core topics, including exceptions, modules, strings, and regular expressionsA quick reference for Python's built-in types and functions, as well as the key modules in the Python standard library, including sys, os, time, thread, math, and socket, among many othersReference material on important third-party extensions, such as Numeric and TkinterInformation about extending Python and embedding it into other applicationsPython in a Nutshell provides a solid, no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on the most. This latest addition to the best-selling \"In a Nutshell\" series will immediately earn its place in any Python programmer's library.",

        "Title": "Overcoming Depression: A Step-by-Step Approach to Gaining Control Over Depression",
        "Authors": "By Gilbert, Paul",
        "Description": "St. John's Wort, Prozac, psychotherapy, support groups--today's individual suffering from depression has a laundry list of treatments to choose from.  For many, Paul Gilbert's self-help manual Overcoming Depression--based on the highly effective technique of cognitive behavioral therapy--will provide a lifeline to recovery and a better future, as a way to understand and thus resist the downward slide of depression, and as a resource to supplement therapy or medication.    Cognitive behavioral therapy, which treats emotional disorders by changing negative thought-patterns, is now internationally established as a key method for overcoming conditions such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and eating disorders. The principle behind this form of therapy is that our thoughts have a major impact on our emotions: a person who goes through life thinking \"I am unlovable,\" or \"I'll never achieve anything,\" will find constant evidence to support his or her beliefs.  In Overcoming Depression, Gilbert explains the many forms and causes of depression and lays out clinically proven techniques for dealing with this debilitating condition.  This book will help people gain insight into problem areas such as perfectionism, shame, anger, and aggression, and how these areas can become exacerbated by depression. Overcoming Depression illustrates a systematic program of treatment by which people can monitor their thoughts, learn to recognize negative patterns, and challenge them.  With step-by-step suggestions, case examples, thought-monitoring sheets, and practical ideas for gaining control over depression, Gilbert offers a course of action for those suffering from depression to change the way they think about themselves and their problems.     The Second Edition of Overcoming Depression presents new statistics and findings from the last three years, and offers new chapters on causes for depression including \"Biology and Stress,\" \"How Evolution May Have Shaped Depression,\" and \"Early Life, Psychological and Social Aspects.\" In a new chapter on guilt Gilbert differentiates between guilt and shame, and examines the relationship between guilt and depression and how to deal with those who make us feel guilty. Finally, a new preface and a new brief discussion of St. John's Wort complete the text.",

In Citizen You, Tisch challenges readers to join this movement and points the way toward making our world a better place, one person and one neighborhood at a time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tisch has filled Citizen You with accounts of people who you\u2019ll meet, such inspirational individuals as: Scott Harrison, who has used the networking and marketing skills he developed as a night club promoter\u00a0 to help over a million people in the developing world get access for the first time to clean, safe drinking water.Steffi Coplan, whose Broadway2Broadway project brought\u00a0 out the hidden musical talents of kids at an inner city school.Eric Schwarz, who decided to do something about America\u2019s under-performing schools, and parlayed a single classroom mentoring project into the nationwide Citizens Schools movement.Chris Swan, who is training a new generation of \u201ccitizen engineers\u201d to make sure that the projects they build aren\u2019t just structurally sound but also environmentally and socially sustainable. Dave Nelson, who traded his role as an executive at IBM for a job at a struggling nonprofit that teaches kids about the power of entrepreneurship\u2014and discovered a host of new challenges and rewards in the process.Through these and many other remarkable\u00a0stories, you\u2019ll learn how today\u2019s\u00a0active citizens are\u00a0 transforming thinking about social change.\u00a0Rather than short-term fixes and hand-me-down charity, they\u2019re striving to build sustainable, systemic solutions to our most challenging problems, building and empowering communities rather than fostering dependency.\u00a0 And they\u2019re using a host of new tools, from online networking and private-public partnerships to corporate engagement and social entrepreneurship, to redefine how change can happen. Citizen You is a potent antidote to pessimism. At a time of unprecedented challenges on the national and world stage, when active citizenship is not a choice but a necessity, Citizen You dares us to reshape the social, political, and intellectual structures that have long confined us, and offers fresh thinking that redefines the very concept of activism.

Stuck in small-town New Hampshire in 1855, Louisa finds herself torn between a love that takes her by surprise and her dream of independence as a writer in Boston. The choice she must make comes with a steep price that she will pay for the rest of her life.",

        "Authors": "By Gartenstein-ross, Daveed",
        "Description": "My Year Inside Radical Islam is a memoir of first a spiritual and then a political seduction. Raised in liberal Ashland, Oregon, by parents who were Jewish by birth but dismissive of strict dogma, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross yearned for a religion that would suit all his ideals. At college in the late nineties he met a charismatic Muslim student who  grounded his political activism with thoughtful religious conviction. Gartenstein-Ross reflects on his experience of converting to Islam-a process that began with a desire to connect with both a religious community and a spiritual practice, and eventually led him to sympathize with the most extreme interpretations of the faith, with the most radical political implications.  In the year following graduation, Gartenstein-Ross went to work for the al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, a charity dedicated to fostering Wahhabism, Saudi Arabia's austere form of Islam-a theological inspiration for many terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda. Shortly after he left al-Haramain-when his own fan-aticism had waned-the foundation was charged by the U.S. government as being a source of funds for terrorist organizations. Gartenstein-Ross, by this time a lawyer at a prominent firm, volunteered to be questioned by the FBI. They already knew who he was.  The story of how a good faith can be distorted and a decent soul can be seduced away from its principles, My Year Inside Radical Islam provides a rare glimpse into the personal interface between religion and politics.",

Building on his previous groundbreaking work on the Al Qaeda network, forensic psychiatrist Marc Sageman has greatly expanded his research to explain how Islamic terrorism emerges and operates in the twenty-first century.In Leaderless Jihad, Sageman rejects the views that place responsibility for terrorism on society or a flawed, predisposed individual. Instead, he argues, the individual, outside influence, and group dynamics come together in a four-step process through which Muslim youth become radicalized. First, traumatic events either experienced personally or learned about indirectly spark moral outrage. Individuals interpret this outrage through a specific ideology, more felt and understood than based on doctrine. Usually in a chat room or other Internet-based venues, adherents share this moral outrage, which resonates with the personal experiences of others. The outrage is acted on by a group, either online or offline.Leaderless Jihad offers a ray of hope. Drawing on historical analogies, Sageman argues that the zeal of jihadism is self-terminating; eventually its followers will turn away from violence as a means of expressing their discontent. The book concludes with Sageman's recommendations for the application of his research to counterterrorism law enforcement efforts.",

        "Description": "There are two kinds of math: the hard kind and the easy kind. The easy kind, practiced by ants, shrimp, Welsh corgis?and us?is innate.What innate calculating skills do we humans have? Leaving aside built-in mathematics, such as the visual system, ordinary people do just fine when faced with mathematical tasks in the course of the day. Yet when they are confronted with the same tasks presented as ?math,\u201d their accuracy often drops.But if we have innate mathematical ability, why do we have to teach math and why do most of us find it so hard to learn? Are there tricks or strategies that the ordinary person can do to improve mathematical ability? Can we improve our math skills by learning from dogs, cats, and other creatures that ?do math\u201d? The answer to each of these questions is a qualified yes. All these examples of animal math suggest that if we want to do better in the formal kind of math, we should see how it arises from natural mathematics.From NPR\u2019s ?Math Guy\u201d?The Math Instinct will provide even the most number-phobic among us with confidence in our own mathematical abilities.",
