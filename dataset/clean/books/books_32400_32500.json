        "Title": "Pot of Gold",
        "Authors": "By Michael, Judith",
        "Description": "In this sensational new novel, Judith Michael takes one of our most universal fantasies and spins it into glorious, spellbinding reality.Claire Goddard is thirty-four years old, of modest means and looks. She has raised her teenage daughter, Emma, by herself, working as a designer, but without the confidence or means to fully realize her talent. Her only indulgence, once a week, is buying a lottery ticket. Then, one week, she wins sixty million dollars.Overnight everything changes. She quits her job, indulges in the shopping spree of a lifetime - new house, new clothes, new car, new hairstyle and makeup - and then treats herself and Emma to a celebratory cruise in Alaska. There they meet Quentin and Brix Eiger. Handsome, glamorous, a wealthy entrepreneur, Quentin sweeps Claire into his fast-lane fashionable world, while his temperamental son, Brix, engages Emma in her first love affair.Suddenly Claire and Emma are living in the glittering, colorful world of wealth and power. But inside the rainbow, all is not what it seems - Brix persuades Emma to choose a modeling job over college, and has seduced her into his dangerous round of fashion, sex, and drugs. And as Claire discovers a shallowness and predatory drive in Quentin that has been disguised by his manipulative charm, she realizes that his world is in no way superior to hers and that in buying a new life she is losing touch with everything that has always meant the most to her - her daughter, her friends, her work, her sense of home. But Quentin will not let Claire go easily: he and Brix have their own plans for the Goddard women. And when another man, more open and idealistic, more real than Quentin, enters Claire's life, she discovers what she always possessed but never fully recognized - an ability to love deeply and to protect those she loves - strengths and inner resources more valuable than any pot of gold.Judith Michael creates a world as fabulous as a glossy dream, as exciting as a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, but as real as everyday life. This is the most compelling, most complex, most exciting Judith Michael novel yet.",

        "Title": "Seeing Vietnam: Encounters of the Road and Heart",
        "Authors": "By Brownmiller, Susan",
        "Description": "In November 1992, shortly after the U.S. government lifted travel restrictions, Travel & Leisure magazine sent Susan Brownmiller to Vietnam on a tourist visa.\"You take a lot of baggage when you go to Vietnam,\" her piece began. \"One small suitcase, one carry-on, and two thousand pounds of disjunctive emotions napalmed into your brain from a televised war that won't go away.\"The inspired match between author and subject continued after the article's publication as Brownmiller immersed herself in Vietnamese history and current events, rekindling an interest that began in the 1960s. Seeing Vietnam is the result, a traveler's journey in the grand tradition of Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene - part reportage, part impassioned memoir, part serendipitous adventure, all delivered with the acuity, wit, and political sophistication we have come to expect from her.As Brownmiller does the twist in a Hanoi disco, gorges on garlic-fried crab (while passing up the crunchy fried songbirds), bargains for hand-painted ceramics, joins a class in tai chi for older women, drinks tea with the Buddhist monks of Hue, sits crosslegged with the Bru Van Kieu near the ghostly remains of a military base, gives an impromptu English lesson to university students, is offered a pygmy slow loris on a Saigon street, and chats with representatives of some of the larger multinationals in her hotel lobby, the reader shares her intense engagement, her delight in each new encounter, and the emotional catharsis of seeing - and making friends with - a people and a country we have fought but never known.",

Only one Marine in a hundred qualifies for Recon, charged with working clandestinely, often behind enemy lines. Fick\u2019s training begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth, and advances to the pinnacleReconfour years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. Along the way, he learns to shoot a man a mile away, stays awake for seventy-two hours straight, endures interrogation and torture at the secretive SERE course, learns to swim with Navy SEALs, masters the Eleven Principles of Leadership, and much more.His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading twenty-two Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam.

        "Description": "A genius, a great mathematician once said, performs magic, does things that nobody else could do. To his scientific colleagues, Richard Feynman was a magician of the highest caliber. Architect of quantum theories, enfant terrible of the atomic bomb project, caustic critic of the space shuttle commission, Nobel Prize winner for work that gave physicists a new way of describing and calculating the interactions of subatomic particles, Richard Feynman left his mark on virtually every area of modern physics.Originality was his obsession. Never content with what he knew or with what others knew, Feynman ceaselessly questioned scientific truths. But there was also another side to him, one which made him a legendary figure among scientists. His curiosity moved well beyond things scientific: he taught himself how to play drums, to give massages, to write Chinese, to crack safes.In Genius, James Gleick, author of the acclaimed best-seller Chaos, shows us a Feynman few have seen. He penetrates beyond the gleeful showman depicted in Feynman's own memoirs and reveals a darker Feynman: his ambition, his periods of despair and uncertainty, his intense emotional nature.From his childhood on the beaches and backlots of Far Rockaway and his first tinkering with radios and differential equations to the machine shops at MIT and the early theoretical work at Princeton - work that foreshadowed his famous notion of antiparticles traveling backward in time - to the tragic death of his wife while he was working at Los Alamos, Genius shows how one scientist's vision was formed. As that vision crystallized in work that reinvented quantum mechanics, we see Feynman's impact on the elite particle-physics community, and how Feynman grew to be at odds with the very community that idolized him. Finally, Gleick explores the nature of genius, our obsession with it and why the very idea may belong to another time.Genius records the life of a scientist who has forever changed science - and changed what it means to know something in this uncertain century.",

As Diana Morrison laid the table for six at her elegant Central Park apartment, there was no warning of what was to come. Spending New Year\u2019s Eve together was a sacred tradition for Diana, her husband of thirty-two years, Eric, and their best friends, Pascale and John Donnally and Anne and Robert Smith. The future looked rosy as the long-time friends sipped champagne and talked of renting a villa together in the South of France the following summer. But life had other plans . . .Just two weeks after New Year\u2019s, tragedy strikes the heart of their close circle, as Robert Smith suffers a sudden, unexpected loss. Without hesitation, Diana and Eric, Pascale and John rally to his side, united in their support, love, and shared grief. Convinced that a change of scenery is just what Robert needs, they urge him to join them on the Riviera in August. But as they soon discover, the ramshackle old mansion they rented in St. Tropez--sight unseen--is far different from the exquisite villa and sun-drenched gardens touted in the brochure. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling. Beds collapse beneath them. All while a would-be housekeeper in a leopard-skin bikini and six-inch heels sashays through the house with a trio of yapping poodles at her heels. But the biggest surprise of all is the woman Robert invites to the villa as his guest--a lovely, much-younger film actress with mile-long legs and a million-dollar smile. Diana and Pascale hate her on sight. But the men are dazzled. And amid the crumbling furniture and the glorious sunsets, the strained relationships and the acts of forgiveness, more surprises are in store for the villa\u2019s occupants. With the last days of summer fast approaching, each couple finds themselves changing in unexpected ways, as old wounds are healed, new love discovered, and miracles unfold...all beneath the dazzling sun of St. Tropez.By turns wise and moving, heartbreaking and wickedly funny, Danielle Steel\u2019s new novel is about forgiving without forgetting, about the sorrow that shadows our lives and the hope that saves us. And it is about once-in-a-lifetime friendships . . .the kind that heal, sustain, and change us forever.",

This time his family is involved--and for Hardy, a devoted husband and father, the stakes have never been higher. Dismas knows his wife, Frannie, is the most reliable of mothers. When she fails to pick up their children from school one afternoon, he's convinced something terrible has happened. It has: Frannie Hardy is in jail. Called before the grand jury in a murder investigation, she refused to reveal a secret entrusted to her by a man whose children attend the same school as hers, a friend who is accused of killing his wife. But now he has disappeared. Hardy knows there's only one way to get Frannie out of jail: clear her friend of murder. That is, if he can be found. As he moves through a labyrinthine world of big business and San Francisco politics, looking for a man he half hopes never to find, a furious and frustrated Hardy is struggling to understand why his impeccably faithful wife is being so loyal to another man. What kind of truth could keep a wife from her husband, a mother from her children--could hold Hardy so powerless before the wrath of the law?With an unparalleled ability to illuminate the complexities of relationships while weaving a story of breathtaking suspense, Lescroart has never been in finer form. And Nothing But the Truth is his finest hour.",

        "Title": "Playing for the Ashes (Inspector Lynley)",
        "Authors": "By George, Elizabeth",
        "Description": "When country milkman Martin Snell makes his usual delivery to fifteenth-century Celandine Cottage one fine spring morning in Kent, he expects to be greeted by the cottage's sensual and seductive tenant, Gabriella Patten, not by the ugly remains of a fire pointing to murder.A burnt-out chair, a peculiar pattern of smoke on the walls, an asphyxiated corpse, two footprints, and a collection of discarded cigarette butts bring Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers out of their London territory and into conflict with the local investigator who first saw the subtle signs of arson and whose turf they are invading. Treading carefully, they begin investigating the ripples of shock spreading outward from the crime: from Gabriella Patten's husband, who knows of his wife's faithlessness and declares himself completely indifferent, to the estranged wife of a member of the national cricket team whose hopes for a reconciliation with her husband have been permanently smashed; from a former lover of Gabriella who has sworn her off to save his marriage, to an angry teenage boy whose holiday with his father was canceled at the crook of a mistress's finger; from a wealthy older widow whose influence has allowed a much younger man to live his dream of playing cricket, to a former prostitute faced with a devastating choice in the wake of a murder whose victim she claims she has never met and yet whose presence has long shadowed her life.As all of England, as well as the magnetic world of national cricket, soon discovers itself reeling from the shock of this particular crime, Lynley and Havers find themselves working on the most frustrating - and the most dangerously political - case of their careers. When in an act of desperation Lynley breaks department rules to flush out the killer, he risks being pulled from the case and jeopardizes his career with New Scotland Yard.In Playing for the Ashes, Elizabeth George applies her characteristically deft study of human nature to her most masterful novel yet. The result is a powerful work of fiction that pulls the reader into a fully created world to explore the dark side of passion and self-delusion.",

Ultimately, Alice and her family must weather a devastating betrayal and a shocking, violent series of events that will test their love and prove the power of forgiveness.A wise and astonishing novel about the different guises of love and the often steep tolls on the road to adulthood, The God of Animals is a haunting, unforgettable debut.",

Underlying this guidance is the touchpoints concept that has shaped Dr. Brazelton's office practice and research for over three decades. \"Touchpoints\" are the universal spurts of development and the trying periods of regression that accompany them throughout childhood. In this book - as in his office - Brazelton uses them as windows to help parents understand their child's behavior and prevent future problems.Part One of this comprehensive book follows each of these touchpoints from the prenatal visit through the first three years, explaining the characteristic achievements and calming the inevitable worries at each stage. Every chapter ends with a section on \"Looking Ahead.\"Part Two covers the first six years, with all the common behavioral and emotional challenges, in alphabetical order, from allergies to toilet training. Dr. Brazelton reveals how to understand these as the child's issues, warding off parent-child conflict.Part Three explains the vital role of all the important people in a child's life.Touchpoints is a priceless reference. Longer than a housecall, more objective than a grandmother, it puts a brilliant and beloved pediatrician into every home.",

Matthew Shepard's death became a national symbol of intolerance, but for the people of Laramie the event was deeply personal, and it is their voices we hear in this stunningly effective theater piece.Moises Kaufman and fellow members of the Tectonic Theater Project made six trips to Laramie over the course of a year and a half in the aftermath of the beating and conducted more than 200 interviews with people of the town. From these interviews as well as their own experiences, Kaufman and the Tectonic Theater members have constructed a deeply moving theatrical experience. The Laramie Project chronicles the life of the town of Laramie in the year after the murder, using eight actors to embody more than sixty different people in their own words - from rural ranchers to university professors. The result is a complex portrayal that dispels the simplistic media stereotypes and explores the depths to which humanity can sink and the heights of compassion of which we are capable.",

        "Description": "\"[An] important new book . . .Mr. O'Toole puts soul and values squarely back into a vital topic, leadership.\"--Tom Peters The New York Times Book Review\"A deeply philosophical and eminently practical study of leadership as change.\"--James MacGregor BurnsPulitzer Prize and National Book Award winner, and author of LeadershipCurrent management philosophy advocates an outmoded Machiavellian approach to running organizations: Leaders are told in countless books that they can only accomplish their goals by being tough, manipulative, dictatorial, or paternalistic as the situation requires.In Leading Change, noted management theorist James O'Toole proposes a provocative new vision of leadership in the business world--a vision of leadership rooted in moral values and a consistent display of respect for all followers. As O'Toole brilliantly demonstrates, values-based leadership is not only fair and just, it is also highly effective in today's complex organizations.When leaders truly believe that their prime goal is the welfare of their followers, they get results. The finest leaders--from political giants like Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln to contemporary CEOs like Max De Pree and James Houghton--have always shared leadership with their followers. They create organizations that encourage change and self-reevaluation; they foster an atmosphere of open-mindedness and fresh thinking, in which assumptions can be challenged and goals reassessed. Grounded in the ideas of moral philosophy, Leading Change powerfully transcends the standard how-to management primer to define a challenging new approach to leadership. As O'Toole so persuasively argues, growth and change are possible, indeed necessary, and they will be effected by individuals who have the stature and the courage to lead morally. This important book, at once thought-provoking and totally practical, is bound to take its place as one of the landmark business volumes of our times.\"Jim O'Toole has written the essential work for organizations to survive and thrive in today's changing world. His intellectually penetrating thinking shows us how the sometimes conflicting problems we wrestle with--often in piecemeal fashion--fit together to form a complete picture, even as the picture itself continues to change. His message is so critical to the very existence of every organization that any leader who fails to heed his advice condemns his or her company to mediocrity and/or early death. It's that basic.\"--Warren Bennis Professor and founding chairman of the Leadership Institute  at the University of Southern California  Author of An Invented Life and Why Leaders Can't Lead",

        "Description": "Gifted healer Joan Borysenko believes that the wounds we suffer - and heal from - can be gateways to a transformation of the spirit, one that not only nourishes our souls but blesses us with the potential to help our world.In this enlightening book, Dr. Borysenko goes beyond psychology as currently practiced and taps a deeper vein of healing. She reveals to us the power of spiritual optimism, a philosophy that views life crises as opportunities for personal growth and spiritual homecoming.Drawing on her own experiences with tragedy and illness, as well as on anecdotes from her therapy patients, the author combines scientific knowledge with wisdom and insight to show how the most devastating events can initiate a fruitful search for meaning; how wrestling with the demons of pain, strife, and illness can lead us to discover our wholeness; and how meditation, prayer, and heightened awareness can serve as shining beacons during the proverbial \"dark night of the soul.\"These are the times when the soul is on fire, fueled by torment and despair. Yet this same soul burns with an inner flame that can consume old beliefs and negative opinions, allowing a new soul to be born. Thus our darkest moments can lead to spiritual resurrection, bringing us closer to our true hearts...and to the heart of healing.Getting there, however, is never easy. \"Dark nights of the soul\" are perilous emotional voyages through stormy seas of suffering. Here the terrain is shadowy and home seems far, far away; here, most of us need a light to navigate by. \"Fire in the Soul\" is that light, an inspiring and knowing guide to spiritual safe haven in times of loss and pain. Its insight will help you shed self-blame, heal childhood wounds, and gain strength from adversity so that you can find the goodness that is everywhere and feel the love that lights our universe.This book also features a practical resource section listing books, tapes, and addresses of helpful individuals and organizations. One of its most comforting chapters contains stories, poems, and quotations to help restore and revitalize spiritual optimism. And that is the first step to leading a life filled with faith, love, and courage.",

When he's called to chair a subcommittee introducing legislation to ban new cloning technology, the senator views his political future in bold relief; and Dr. Daniel Lowell, inventor of the technique that will take stem cell research to the next level, sees a roadblock positioned before his biotech startup.  The two seemingly opposite personalities clash during the senate hearings, but the men have a common desire. Butler's hunger for political power far outstrips his concern for the unborn; and Lowell's pursuit of gargantuan personal wealth and celebrity overrides any considerations for patients' well-being. Further complicating the proceedings is the confidential news that Senator Butler has developed Parkinson's disease-leading the senator and the researcher into a Faustian pact. In a perilous attempt to prematurely harness Lowell's new technology, the therapy leaves the senator with the horrifying effects of temporal lobe epilepsy-seizures of the most bizarre order.  Torn from the headlines, Seizure is a cautionary tale for a time where biotechnology pulls us into a promising yet frightening new world.",

There is also a rich assortment of vegetable main courses--like Art's fabulous Italian Vegetable Casserole. Traditional dishes include the best-ever Buttermilk Fried Chicken and a Roast Turkey with Pan Gravy that's not just for Thanksgiving!And then there are the celebration cakes, perfect pies, and little sweets. From French Chocolate Almond Pie to Pear and Cranberry Cobbler, from Coconut Cake with Fluffy Icing to Triple-Layer German Chocolate Cake, from Pecan Divinity to Gumdrop Cookies, Back to the Table is filled with delicious treats for any occasion.Art's life's work has involved cooking for families all over the world. These experiences have taught him that families are essentially the same, regardless of international boundaries or cultural differences.

Then, after a generation of relative peace, The Great War exploded worldwide. As the conflict engulfed Europe, the C.S.A. backed the Allies, while the U.S. found its own ally in Imperial Germany. The Confederate States, France, and England all fell. Russia self-destructed, and the Japanese, seeing that the cause was lost, retired to fight another day.The Great War has ended, and an uneasy peace reigns around most of the world. But nowhere is the peace more fragile than on the continent of North America, where bitter enemies share a single landmass and two long, bloody borders.In the North, proud Canadian nationalists try to resist the colonial power of the United States. In the South, the once-mighty Confederate States have been pounded into poverty and merciless inflation. U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt refuses to return to pre-war borders. The scars of the past will not soon be healed. The time is right for madmen, demagogues, and terrorists.At this crucial moment in history, with Socialists rising to power in the U.S. under the leadership of presidential candidate Upton Sinclair, a dangerous fanatic is on the rise in the Confederacy, preaching a message of hate. And in Canada another man--a simple farmer--has a nefarious plan: to assassinate the greatest U.S. war hero, General George Armstrong Custer.With tension on the seas high, and an army of Marxist Negroes lurking in the swamplands of the Deep South, more than enough people are eager to return the world to war. Harry Turtledove sends his sprawling cast of men and women--wielding their own faiths, persuasions, and private demons--into the troubled times between the wars.",

Now, seventy years have passed since the first War Between the States. The North American continent is locked in a battle of politics, economies, and moralities. In a world that has already felt the soul-shattering blow of the Great War, North America is the powder keg that could ignite another global conflict - complete with a new generation of killing machines.\"Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!\" In 1934, the chant echoes across the Confederate States of America, a country born of bloodshed and passion, stretching from Mexico to Virginia. But while people use the word to greet each other in the streets, the meaning of \"Freedom\" has become increasingly unclear.Jake Featherston, leader of the ruling Freedom Party, has won power - and is taking his country and the world to the edge of an abyss. Charismatic, shrewd, and addicted to conflict, Featherston is whipping the Confederate States into a frenzy of hatred. Blacks are being rounded up and sent to prison camps, and the persecution has just begun. Featherston has forced the United States to give up its toeholds in Florida and Kentucky, and as the North stumbles through a succession of leaders, from Socialist Hosea Blackford to Herbert Hoover and now Al Smith, Featherston is feeling his might. With the U.S.A. locked in a bitter, bloody occupation of Canada, facing an intractable rebellion in Utah, and fatigued from a war in the Pacific against Japan, Featherston may pursue one dangerous proposition above all: that he can defeat the U.S.A. in an all-out war.",

Maxwell shows you how this revered ideal works everywhere, and how, especially in business, it brings amazing dividends. There's No Such Thing As \"Business\" Ethics offers: * Stories from history, business, government, and sports that illustrate how talented leaders invoked this timeless principle * Examples of difficult business decisions-layoffs, evaluations, billing clients, expansion-and how the Golden Rule applies to each * The five most common reasons people compromise their ethics-and how you can prevail over such moral obstacles * How applying the Golden Rule to business builds morale, increases productivity, encourages teamwork, lowers employee turnover, and keeps clients coming back.

        "Description": "The Amish, one of America's most intriguing peoples, have survived for 300 years! While much has been written on the Amish recently, little has appeared about their history. This book brings together for the first time in one volume a thorough history of the Amish people. From their beginnings in Europe through their settlement in North America, the Amish have struggled to maintain their beliefs and traditions in often hostile settings. Authoritative, thorough, and interestingly written, A History of the Amish presents the deep and rich heritage of the Amish people. Includes a substantial bibliography for further reading and study. Dozens of illustrations.Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.",

A discouraged man ends up feeling hopeless, helpless, and handcuffed to his situation in life. Confidence is absent. Life is unfair, and the scales are constantly tipped against him. The pessimistic expectations he develops can set him up for failure.\" But a woman's encouragement can make a vital difference in a man's outlook. \"Encouragement is letting the other person know, 'You matter to me.' Encouragement is building up a person. It's focusing on any resource which can be turned into an asset or strength.\"In this book, Norman Wright will how you how to tap your potential to encourage. He shows you what works and what doesn't; when to talk and when to listen; what to say and what not to say, and the difference between encouragement and nagging. Wright offers real life stories of men and women who found creative ways to encourage each other-ideas that can work for you as well.How to Encourage the Man in Your Life offers practical guidance for understanding a man and encouraging him. You'll hear what other men have to say about the subject, what not to do, how to encourage him through sex and romance, how other women are encouraging their men, and the power of a woman's prayers to inspire the man she loves. Stories of other couples' experiences will help you apply proven principles of encouragement to your own situation.",
