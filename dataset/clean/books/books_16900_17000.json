        "Authors": "By Gulland, Sandra",
        "Description": "In this first of three books inspired by the life of Josephine Bonaparte, Sandra Gulland has created a novel of immense and magical proportions. We meet Josephine in the exotic and lush Martinico, where an old island woman predicts that one day she will be queen. The journey from the remote village of her birth to the height of European elegance is long, but Josephine's fortune proves to be true. By way of fictionalized diary entries, we traverse her early years as she marries her one true love, bears his children, and is left betrayed, widowed, and penniless. It is Josephine's extraordinary charm, cunning, and will to survive that catapults her to the heart of society, where she meets Napoleon, whose destiny will prove to be irrevocably intertwined with hers.",

What can we do to protect ourselves? In this extraordinary analysis, John Wargo, one of the nation's leading experts in pesticide policy, traces the history of pesticide law and science, with a focus on the special hazards faced by children.Wargo presents a compelling case that children are more heavily exposed to some pesticides than adults and are especially vulnerable to some adverse effects. How should the fractured body of environmental law be repaired to manage the distribution of risk? This is the central question Wargo addresses as he suggests fundamental reforms of science and law necessary to understand and contain the health risks faced by children.",

        "Description": "At once darkly comedic and moving, this witty exploration of female friendship, envy, and misguided ambition by the author of the number-one bestseller Drowning Ruth, deliciously satirizes the desire to shine in the world.In All is Vanity, Margaret and Letty, best friends since childhood and now living on opposite coasts, reach their mid-thirties and begin to chafe at their sense that they are not where they ought to be in life. Margaret, driven and overconfident, decides the best way to rectify this is to quit her job and whip out a literary tour de force. Frustrated almost immediately and humiliated at every turn, Margaret turns to Letty for support. But as Letty, a stay-at-home mother of four, begins to feel pressured to make a good showing in the upper-middle-class Los Angeles society into which her husband\u2019s new job has thrust her, Margaret sees a plot unfolding that\u2019s better than anything she could make up. Desperate to finish her book and against her better nature, she pushes Letty to take greater and greater risks, and secretly steals her friend\u2019s stories as fast as she can live them. Hungry for the world\u2019s regard, Margaret rashly sacrifices one of the things most precious to her, until the novel\u2019s suspenseful conclusion shows her the terrible consequences of her betrayal. Widely celebrated for her debut novel, Drowning Ruth, Christina Schwarz once again proves herself to be a writer of remarkable depth and range. Like Drowning Ruth, All is Vanity probes into the mysteries of the human heart and uncovers the passions that drive ordinary people to break the rules in pursuit of their own desires.",

Out of that experience cameRussia, a book that probed beneath the usual surface observations, stereotypes, and official rhetoric to present a subtle, multi-layered depiction of the tenor of the country behind the Soviet fa\u00e7ade. In 1989, Shipler returned to write an updated edition, retaining his focus on the durable features of Russian life and spirit, while taking into account the changes wrought by Gorbachev and glasnost at the end of the Cold War. The result is a memorable, incisive, and emininetly human portrait of the Russian people that remains as vital as ever amid increased tensions between Russia and the United States.",

Rob seeks refuge in the company of the offbeat clerks at his store, who endlessly review their top five films (Reservoir Dogs...); top five Elvis Costello songs (\"Alison\"...); top five episodes of Cheers (the one where Woody sang his stupid song to Kelly...). Rob tries dating a singer whose rendition of \"Baby, I Love Your Way\" makes him cry. But maybe it's just that he's always wanted to sleep with someone who has a record contract. Then he sees Laura again. And Rob begins to think (awful as it sounds) that life as an episode of thirtysomething, with all the kids and marriages and barbecues and k.d. lang CD's that this implies, might not be so bad.",

        "Description": "In the follow-up to his very successful Black Lies, White Lies, controversial talk-show host and radio commentator Tony Brown presents a practical plan to reclaim our resources and institutions from a selfish and exclusive power elite.At the start of the twentieth century, argues Tony Brown, the world's economy was hijacked. In capitalist and communist countries alike, elitist groups took control of international trade and national banks, with dire results for the ordinary citizen. Ever since, capital has moved toward a single inner circle -- the Ruling Class Conspiracy -- who monopolize the world's markets and even its governments for personal profit. Their stratagems range from the \"war\" against drugs to deliberately induced racial conflict among ethnic groups in America -- none in earnest, all carefully designed to preserve a pernicious status quo.But Tony Brown has a remedy. His provocative and empowering seven-step plan offers an opportunity to break free once and for all from the constricting control of the wealthy and powerful who have run the world for far too long -- including a point-by-point program for radical reform of the income tax and a proposal to muzzle the Federal Reserve Bank, which exerts unconscionable influence over the lives of every American.Incendiary and persuasive, this book reaches beyond race to claim the high ground of historical, logical, and moral analysis. For nearly half a century of Cold War, America and the Free World were defined by opposition to Communism . . . but was this merely a red herring to ensure the domination of the haves over the have-nots? Read Empower the People, form your own conclusions . . . and hit the brakes!",

        "Description": "Life Support offers an intimate and important look at what nurses do for patients and their families. It takes us right to the bedside on hospital wards and home visits, in clinics and emergency rooms, capturing the drama of nurses' work in the story of three RNs at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital.Gordon's heroines are nurse practitioner Ellen Kitchen, who bicycles through poor neighborhoods in Boston to visit elderly patients at home; oncology nurse Nancy Rumplik, whose technical skill and emotional support enable cancer patients to endure some of the most arduous high-tech medical treatments; and clinical nurse specialist Jeannie Chaisson, who helps new RNs and physicians begin their careers on a general medical floor.Life Support draws on the experience of these and other nurses to examine the history of their profession, the complex relationship between doctors and nurses, and the central role that nurses play in the final days of life, when care, not cure, is a patient's main concern.In addition, the book makes a powerful critique of hospital restructuring and managed care. Gordon shows how understaffing, shorter hospital stays, layoffs, and replacement of nurses by unlicensed personnel are threatening the quality of care and shifting more of its burden onto patients' families. She describes what consumers can do to resist these trends - through alliances with concerned providers.",

It explains step-by-step how we can use present-day technology to send humans to Mars within ten years; actually produce fuel and oxygen on the planet's surface with Martian natural resources; how we can build bases and settlements; and how we can one day \"terraform\" Mars?a process that can alter the atmosphere of planets and pave the way for sustainable life.",

        "Title": "Ending Europe's Wars: Continuing Search for Peace and Security",
        "Authors": "By Dean, Jonathan",
        "Description": "In Ending Europe's Wars, Jonathan Dean, a widely recognized expert on European security issues, evaluates the prospects for peace in Europe as a test case for world security. Dean analyzes the current and potential conflicts in Europe and assesses the performance of the multilateral security institutions active in Europe - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western European Union (WEU), and the United Nations itself - in coping with these challenges. He presents a wide range of innovative proposals for dealing with continuing nuclear dangers in Russia, for bringing NATO, WEU, and CSCE together in a single effective European security organization, and for defusing the ethnic hatreds that have already caused at least five bloody wars.Ending Europe's Wars traces the dramatic course of change in Europe - perestroika, the liberation of Eastern Europe, the collapse of the Soviet Union - to uncover the roots of today's problems. The author shows how these positive developments have also brought real or potential threats to European security: the Russian confrontation with Ukraine; the uncertainties surrounding Russian military intervention in neighboring republics; the possibility that Russia's nuclear arsenal could get out of control; massive population movements sparking racism and intolerance in Western Europe; tragic, unresolved ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and the states bordering Russia; a resurgent Germany; and growing confrontation with fundamentalist Islam.Dean describes the numerous military constraints, cooperative procedures for conflict prevention, and organizational changes that have made European security institutions and the confidence-building measures and arms limitations they are based on the most comprehensive and ambitious regional security system in recorded history. He demonstrates why these institutions have nonetheless coped inadequately with Europe's emerging wars, especially in the former Yugoslavia, and how they can be radically improved. Dean concludes that the job of constructing an effective European security system is only half done. The present system could move either toward greater control over conflict or toward slow collapse and renationalization and the expansion of the armed forces of individual European countries. Either outcome will have a decisive effect on the future of the United Nations and global security.",

Lawrence and something of a rival of Virginia Woolf, her stories suggest someone writing in a different era and in a vastly different English. Her language is as transparent as clean glass, yet hovers on the edge of poetry. Her characters are passionate men and women swaddled in English reserve -- and sometimes briefly breaking through. And her genius is to pinpoint those unacknowledged and almost imperceptible moments in which those people's relationships -- with one another and themselves -- change forever. This collection includes such masterpieces as \"Prelude,\" \"At the Bay\" \"Bliss,\" \"The Man Without a Temperament\" and \"The Garden Party\" and has a new introduction by Jeffrey Meyers.",

The events leading to-and following-this turning point in history are shrouded in mystery. Distorted by the biased accounts written by a subjugated people, many believe it was the English who ultimately won the battle, since the Normans became assimilated into the English way of life.\u00a0Drawing on a wealth of contemporary sources, David Howarth gives us memorable portraits of the kings:\u00a0Edward the Confessor, Harold of England, William of Normandy, as well as the leading political figures of the time. Howarth describes the English commoners: how they\u00a0worked, fought, died, and how they perceived the overthrow of their world from their isolated shires.",

Value-judgements, for instance, presuppose freedom of choice and if responsible actions are to be based on them, man must be free to act according to his decisions. There is clearly an urgent need for a philosophy which can be lived; and it is as a philosophy of this kind that Existentialism exists. In this book Roubiczek confronts the prevalent 'objective' method with the 'subjective' and attempts a proper balance between the objective and the personal, the scientific and the ethical. Concentrating on the valuable aspects of Existentialism, he looks for positive results which can be philosophically justified and, at the same time, accepted as a way of life. This approach leads both towards and beyond Existentialism, so that the book is both an introduction to this school of philosophy and a critique of it.",

In her previous book, Anatomy of the Spirit, Dr. Myss illuminated the hidden interactions of belief and body, soul and cell to show how, as she inimitably puts it, \"your biography becomes your biology.\" In Why People Don't Heal and How They Can, she builds on her earlier teachings of the seven different energy centers of the body to provide a vital self-healing program for physical and spiritual disorders. With her characteristic no-nonsense style and high-voltage storytelling, she exposes and explodes the five myths about healing, explains the cultural and individual contexts in which people become physically and spiritually ill and invested in \"woundology,\" and teaches new methods of working with the challenges that the seven energy centers embody.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To help you get and stay on the path to wellness, Dr. Myss provides rituals and prayers for gaining a symbolic perspective on your life issues; for bolstering your personal power; and for connecting with a universal divine energy. Dr. Myss's breakthrough views on energy medicine and her active approach to healing life issues and physical illness will help you overcome the mental blocks that keep you from becoming well.",

        "Authors": "By Fliegel, Seymour and Macguire, James",
        "Description": "Miracle in East Harlem is the story of how the public schools of one of New York City's poorest neighborhoods broke a decades-long pattern of defeat, failure, and frustration to become centers of learning and hope. Seymour Fliegel, a former deputy superintendent of District Four in East Harlem and one of the driving forces behind this renaissance, tells how a core of dedicated teachers and eager students rescued the local schools from their persistent status as the worst in the city. In time, District Four's success would propel superintendent Anthony Alvarado to the chancellorship of the New York City public school system and earn a MacArthur \"genius grant\" for Deborah Meier, one of its most innovative principals. Fliegel himself has become one of the nation's leading authorities on educational innovation.Central to East Harlem's transformation was the institution of \"choice.\" Since 1982 students and parents in District Four have actively selected the schools they wish to attend, rather than being assigned based on where they live. These new \"alternative schools\" are smaller and more thematically oriented than traditional schools, and those that fail to attract enough students or meet the district's new standards are disbanded and replaced by other programs. The results have been immediate and striking, all the more so because the neighborhood's student body remains among the poorest school populations in the nation. Indeed, today District Four is a model for other communities, rich and poor alike, and is regularly cited by Republicans and Democrats as the shining example of how choice can work in urban public schools.Through this heartwarming, real-life success story, Fliegel and James MacGuire make a convincing case for public school choice. They show that if it can happen in East Harlem, it can happen anywhere.",

One fourth of the child-bearing women in the neighborhoods where these children live test positive for HIV. Pediatric AIDS, life-consuming fires, and gang rivalries take a high toll. Several children die during the year in which this narrative takes place.Although it is a gently written work, Amazing Grace makes clear that the postmodern ghetto of America is not a social accident but is created and sustained by greed, neglect, racism, and expedience. It asks us questions that are, at once, political and theological. What is the value of a child's life? What exactly do we plan to do with those whom we appear to have defined as economically and humanly superfluous? How tough do we dare to be?",

Hersh has riveted readers -- and outraged the Bush Administration -- with his explosive stories in The New Yorker, including his headline-making pieces on the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. Now, Hersh brings together what he has learned, along with new reporting, to answer the critical question of the last four years: How did America get from the clear morning when two planes crashed into the World Trade Center to a divisive and dirty war in Iraq?In Chain of Command, Hersh takes an unflinching look behind the public story of the war on terror and into the lies and obsessions that led America into Iraq. Hersh draws on sources at the highest levels of the American government and intelligence community, in foreign capitals, and on the battlefield for an unparalleled view of a critical chapter in America's recent history. In a new afterword, he critiques the government's failure to adequately investigate prisoner abuse -- at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere -- and punish those responsible. With an introduction by The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick, Chain of Command is a devastating portrait of an administration blinded by ideology and of a president whose decisions have made the world a more dangerous place for America.",

Not only does this guy steal other reporters' stories, he also has a fascination with power, and is determined to destroy a restaurant that has become the focus of Chas's latest research.While Ringo runs rampant at the Examiner, plots to crush Chas's friends, and cooks up ways to horn in on her territory, the question becomes not whether he will be taken out, but when and who will finally be driven to do it? For Ringo has made more than one enemy since arriving in town, and in a case like this, Chas isn't even sure she wants to find out which one of them has finally had enough.For mystery lovers and foodies alike, Who's Afraid of Virginia Ham? is a deliciously wicked whodunit with all the right ingredients, served up by the restaurant and newspaper worlds' consummate insider, Phyllis Richman.",

        "Title": "Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute",
        "Authors": "By Blanchard, Kenneth H., Randolph, Alan, and Carlos, John P.",
        "Description": "Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute tells the story of a young manager whose attempts to turn his troubled company around through traditional top-down, command-and-control management are failing. Reluctantly, he contacts an expert in empowerment, even though he feels like he&apos;s already tried that too. Step by step, the expert helps him understand why his past and present efforts have fallen short and exactly what he needs to do to create an empowered workforce. The process as it unfolds is complex, paradoxical and counterintuitive -but well worth the effort. The new introduction dispels the notion that empowerment is a bygone fad. No matter what its name, the essential concept-that organizations can achieve extraordinary results by recognizing and taking advantage of the skills, experience, and knowledge already existing in the organization-will always be relevant. The new epilogue describes obstacles companies have encountered and overcome and outlines empowerment strategies that have proved successful during the fifteen years the authors have been consulting, researching, and refining these concepts. Although sometimes arduous, the journey to empowerment is well worth making. In fact, unleashing the power of people in an organization may be the only way to continue to do business in a competitive, complicated marketplace.",
