It reviews the changing security environment in key regions of the world: Russia, East Asia, the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Europe. And it identifies the issues that the United States must face in the next century: peace operations, conflict and arms control, and the widening array of missions undertaken by U.S. armed forces.\"We have chosen to emphasize 'power,' broadly defined, as the central dimension of international and national security. This is not to deny that various trends and forces are increasingly pressing states toward more cooperative, less confrontational behavior; rather it is to focus on the fact that on important issues many states -- including all the great powers -- apply a power calculus in dealing with other international actors.\" -- from the fifth edition of American National SecurityPraise for previous editions:\"A classic text, widely used in universities...

UNDER THE BLACK FLAG tells their story in a rollicking account of the golden age of piracy that is packed with history, anecdote, and above all adventure. Here are the true stories of such bloodthirsty legends as Blackbeard and Captain Kidd, Anne Bonny, and the fearsome Mary Read. And here are rousing descriptions of what ships pirates sailed, what punishments they exacted, what they really wore, and how they flourished--or perished. From the smoky havoc of shipboard battle to the loneliness of a fugitive's life at sea, this spellbinding narrative vividly brings the brutal world of pirates to life.",

Fisher worked diligently, and against time, in the months just before her death to assemble her never-before-published journals, short stories, and correspondence, weaving them into two volumes. Continuing where she left off in To Begin Again, this book presents a candid and revealing portrait of the artist during what may have been the most traumatic period of her life.Fisher and her first husband, Al, had returned from France to California by 1933, but the Depression had reduced their hopes and frustrated their artistic aspirations. After a short stay, they left California for Switzerland, accompanied by their friend Dillwyn Parrish.This is Fisher's most open account of their complicated triangle, and in it she reveals the details behind her decision to divorce her husband and marry Parrish. A short time after their marriage, Parrish developed Buerger's disease, and Fisher chronicles their heartbreaking battle with this terrible degenerative illness. As fascism swept across Europe, they returned to California, remaining through Parrish's decline and ultimate suicide. This was an excruciating time for Fisher, who was forced to watch helplessly as the disease ravaged the man she would call \"the love of my life,\" just as the Nazis marched in to conquer her beloved France.\"When I write of hunger,\" says Fisher, \"I am really writing about love and the hunger for it... [and] the warmth and the riches and the fine reality of hunger satisfied... and it is all one.\" Stay Me, Oh Comfort Me documents, with arresting candor and emotion, the loves and longing that would shape the rest of Fisher's remarkable life and forever inform her work.",

Countless news stories and anecdotes from friends and family make the overwhelming case that we're running ourselves ragged.  But when people actually keep track of their activities in a time diary, studies show that we have significantly more free time per day than in 1965.  So why is everyone out of time?&#149;   Surburban sprawl is ruining America. Huge subdivisions and massive highway construction is eating up our free space and affecting our quality of life.

With a determined commitment to the history of his native land, Nathaniel Hawthorne revealed, more incisively than any writer of his generation, the nature of a distinctly American consciousness. The pieces collected here deal with essentially American matters: the Puritan past, the Indians, the Revolution. But Hawthorne was highly - often wickedly - unorthodox in his account of life in early America, and his precisely constructed plots quickly engage the reader's imagination. Written in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s, these works are informed by themes that reappear in Hawthorne's longer works:\u00a0The Scarlet Letter,\u00a0The House of the Seven Gables\u00a0and\u00a0The Blithedale Romance. And, as Michael J. Colacurcio points out in his excellent introduction, they are themes that are now deeply embedded in the American literary tradition.",

        "Description": "Following in the bestselling footsteps of Little Red Book of Selling, Little Red Book of Sales Answers, Little Black Book of Connections, and The Little Gold Book of YES! Attitude, Jeffrey Gitomer's The Little Green Book of Getting Your Way digs deep into the 9.5 elements that make persuasion, and getting your way, happen. By breaking down the elements, the reader will begin to understand, take action, become proficient, and then master the ability to persuade. Because persuasion occurs in so many different areas of life and business, Gitomer leads the reader from mental readiness to the principles of getting your way and the power that persuasion offers. He challenges the reader to prepare before they present, to prepare before they try to persuade. He demonstrates how to change a presentation into a performance and shows how this can be done in any environment. But because persuasion most often takes place in business, he draws special emphasis to the reader's ability to write and sell persuasively. The book talks about the persistence that enables winning persuasion. He brings the Benjamin Franklin quote \"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again\" to the Gitomer level of \"You only fail when you decide to quit,\" and the book ends challenging the reader how to think about excellence and eloquence. It will be up to the reader to take advantage of the opportunity and harness the power.",

        "Description": "Now the inspiration for the CBS Television drama, \"The Unit.\" Delta Force. They  are the U.S. Army's most elite top-secret strike force. They dominate the modern  battlefield, but you won't hear about their heroics on CNN. No headlines can reveal  their top-secret missions, and no book has ever taken readers inside\u2014until now. Here,  a founding member of Delta Force takes us behind the veil of secrecy and into the  action-to reveal the never-before-told story of 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-D  (Delta Force). He is a master of espionage, trained to take on hijackers, terrorists, hostage  takers, and enemy armies. He can deploy by parachute or arrive by commercial aircraft.  Survive alone in hostile cities. Speak foreign languages fluently. Strike at enemy  targets with stunning swiftness and extraordinary teamwork. He is the ultimate modern  warrior: the Delta Force Operator. In this dramatic behind-the-scenes chronicle,  Eric Haney, one of the founding members of Delta Force, takes us inside this legendary  counterterrorist unit. Here, for the first time, are details of the grueling selection  process\u2014designed to break the strongest of men\u2014that singles out the best of the best:  the Delta Force Operator. With heart-stopping immediacy, Haney tells what it's really  like to enter a hostage-held airplane. And from his days in Beirut, Haney tells an  unforgettable tale of bodyguards and bombs, of a day-to-day life of madness and beauty,  and of how he and a teammate are called on to kill two gunmen targeting U.S. Marines  at the Beirut airport. As part of the team sent to rescue American hostages in Tehran,  Haney offers a first-person description of that failed mission that is a chilling,  compelling account of a bold maneuver undone by chance\u2014and a few fatal mistakes. From fighting guerrilla warfare in Honduras to rescuing missionaries in Sudan and  leading the way onto the island of Grenada, Eric Haney captures the daring and discipline  that distinguish the men of Delta Force. Inside Delta Force brings honor to these  singular men while it puts us in the middle of action that is sudden, frightening,  and nonstop around the world.",

There are many excellent books out on the subject of near death experiences, and life after death experiences, but I had always been curious as I got older what the process of shedding my body suit was all about. Just about the time I thought I would even start looking for a book on the topic I would get a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach and decide maybe it wasn't a good idea after all. I would recommend this gentle honest helper to anyone who has a true desire to learn the many facet of such a natural part of life.\"-Riki Frahmann www.mysticlivingtoday.com",
