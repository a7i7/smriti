This is also the story of the Houston brothers, Bill and James, young men who drift out of the Arizona desert into a war in which the line between disinformation and delusion has blurred away. In its vision of human folly, and its gritty, sympathetic portraits of men and women desperate for an end to their loneliness, whether in sex or death or by the grace of God, this is a story like nothing in our literature.Tree of Smoke is Denis Johnson\u2019s first full-length novel in nine years, and his most gripping, beautiful, and powerful work to date.Tree of Smoke is the 2007 National Book Award Winner for Fiction.",

As the air turns crisp the Virginia hills around Myra's lovely old farmhouse, the Sisterhood has gathered for a little creative planning, and what they have in mind is a gift for Myra of long-awaited and very sweet revenge.  .  .\"Revenge is a dish best served with cloth napkins and floral centerpieces.  .  .fast-paced.  .  .puts poetic justice first.\"--Publishers Weekly",

In The Players, you'll find listings of the top 100 players at each position in the major leagues, along with James's signature stats-based ratings method called \u201cWin Shares,\u201d a way of quantifying individual performance and calculating the offensive and defensive contributions of catchers, pitchers, infielders, and outfielders. And there's more: the Reference section covers Win Shares for each season and each player, and even offers a Win Share team comparison.

Here is the history of the war as it affected soldiers and civilians, loyalists and patriots, leaders and common folk - people who courageously prevailed against an enemy with vastly superior resources.   Included are such stories as:  Thomas Jefferson's painful discomfort as the Continental Congress made changes in his vaunted Declaration of Independence.  Two rogue warriors, loyalist and patriot, who thought nothing of murder, arson, and kidnapping as a means to victory during the conflict. Henry Knox's gritty effort to drag a large number of cannons from Fort Ticonderoga in northeastern New York to Boston. George Washington's embarrassment and fury in dealing with Benedict Arnold's young wife - hysterical and scantily clad - on the day Arnold deserted the American cause. British soldiers who got General Charles Lee's horse drunk after capturing Lee one morning in a surprise raid on his New Jersey \"bed and breakfast.\" Teenager Andrew Jackson, later president, rescued from British captivity by his mother, to Britain's chagrin. Burton Gwinnett of Georgia, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, who was fatally wounded in a senseless pistol duel by Lachlan McIntosh, a patriot leader.  Also included are fascinating stories of several founding mothers, including Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, Betsy Ross, Molly Pitcher, Janet Livingston Montgomery, and many others.",

A conceptual approach provides readers with the necessary framework for understanding the cultural dimension of the international business arena.

        "Description": "In his introduction to The Best American Travel Writing 2008, editor Anthony Bourdain writes that the pieces that \u201cspoke the loudest and most powerfully to me were usually evocative of the darker side, those moments fearful, sublime, and absurd; the small epiphanies familiar to the full-time traveler, interspersed by a sense of dislocation\u2014and the strange, unholy need to record the experience.\u201d With this in mind, Bourdain and series editor Jason Wilson have assembled a wide-ranging and wonderfully eclectic collection that delves headlong into those darker moments and subtle realizations, looking to absorb, provoke, and offer a moving record of what it means to travel in the twenty-first century.Here you will find Seth Stevenson\u2019s extraordinary experience of \u201cLooking for Mammon in the Muslim World\u201d as he makes his way through sweltering and paradoxical Dubai. Exotic tastes and larger-than-life personalities abound as Bill Buford accompanies the chocolate maker Frederick Schilling to the rain forests of Brazil. And on the other side of the world, Calvin Trillin trolls Singapore for the ultimate street food, while Kristin Ohlson delves into the harrowing challenges faced by proprietors of restaurants in Kabul, Afghanistan.The twenty-five pieces in this collection have their fair share of the absurd as well. David Sedaris explains the hilarious highs (sundaes) and woeful lows (sobbing with your seatmate) of flying Business Elite. Gary Shteyngart goes \u201cTo Russia for Love\u201d during St. Petersburg\u2019s vodka-soaked wedding season. And Emily Maloney gets up close and personal with her fellow travelers \u2014 and their massage devices \u2014 in a South American hostel.Culled from an amazing variety of publications, \u201cthe writing in this volume is so vibrantly good, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve armchair-traveled around the world\u201d (Chicago Sun Times).",

        "Title": "Confessions of an Eco-Sinner: Tracking Down the Sources of My Stuff",
        "Authors": "By Pearce, Fred",
        "Description": "Where does everything in our daily lives come from? The clothes on our backs, the computers on our desks, the cabinets in our kitchens, and the food behind their doors? Under what conditions-environmental and social-are they harvested or manufactured? Veteran science journalist Fred Pearce set off to find out, and the resulting 100,000-mile journey took him to the end of his street and across the planet to more than twenty countries. Pearce deftly shows us the hidden worlds that sustain a Western lifestyle, and he does it by examining the sources of everything in his own life; as an ordinary citizen of the Western world, he, like all of us, is an \"eco-sinner.\" In Confessions of an Eco-Sinner, Pearce surveys his home and then launches on a global tour to track down, among other things, the Tanzanians who grow and harvest his fair-trade coffee (which isn't as fair as one might hope), the Central American plantations that grow his daily banana (a treat that may disappear forever), the women in the Bangladeshi sweatshops who sew his jeans, the Chinese factory cities where the world's computers are made, and the African afterlife for old cell phones. It's a fascinating portrait, by turns sobering and hopeful, of the effects the world's more than 6 billion inhabitants-all eating, consuming, making-have on our planet, and of the working and living conditions of the people who produce most of these goods.",
