With its new design, contemporary coverage, and engaging writing style, it remains the leading Nutrition text for the non-majors or mixed majors/non-majors introductory course. Drawing readers into the study of nutrition, the authors have created a number of learning tools that are both appealing and accessible. From the chapter content and new \"Do You Ever\u2026\" sections to the \"Food Feature\" boxes and end-of-chapter \"Controversies,\" students find the information they need to better understand important nutrition concepts and to make informed and responsible decisions about their own nutrition. Additionally, the \"Do It\" activities, now available online, on the student CD-ROM, and in a free booklet that can be packaged with the text, students can practice applying their nutrition knowledge. There is also the accompanying NUTRITION CONNECTIONS CD-ROM, a unique resource that includes animations, chapter quizzes, a comprehensive glossary, \"Do It!\" activities, and Web links. For instructors, we offer a newly redesigned Multimedia Manager that includes PowerPoint slides, animations, videos, and test questions. We also offer a new JoinIn\u2122 on TurningPoint, a classroom resource to assess students' knowledge, take attendance, and more. So, whether looking for a text full of up-to-date information, a text that students enjoy reading, a text that offers a robust supplements package, or a text that can engage students and get them excited about studying, NUTRITION CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES is the text for you!",

        "Title": "Dirty Politics: Deception, Distraction, and Democracy",
        "Authors": "By Jamieson, Kathleen Hall",
        "Description": "Americans in recent years have become thoroughly disenchanted with our political campaigns, especially with campaign advertising and speeches. Each year, as November approaches, we are bombarded with visceral appeals that bypass substance, that drape candidates in the American flag but tell us nothing about what they'll do if elected, that flood us with images of PT-109 or Willie Horton, while significant issues--such as Kennedy's Addison's Disease or the looming S&L catastrophe--are left unexamined. And the press--the supposed safeguard of democracy--focuses on campaign strategy over campaign substance, leaving us to decide where the truth lies.      In Dirty Politics, campaign analyst Kathleen Hall Jamieson provides an eye-opening look at political ads and speeches, showing us how to read, listen to, and watch political campaigns. Jamieson provides a sophisticated (and often humorous) analysis of advertising technique, describing how television ads use soft focus, slow motion, lyrical or patriotic music (Reagan used \"I'm Proud to be an American\") to place a candidate in a positive light, or quick cuts, black and white, videotape, and ominous music (for instance, the theme from \"Jaws\") to portray the opposition. She shows how ads sometimes mimic news spots to add authenticity (Edwin Edwards, in his race against David Duke, actually used former NBC correspondent Peter Hackis, who would begin an ad saying \"This is Peter Hackis in Baton Rouge\"). And Jamieson points out that consultants create inflammatory ads hoping that the major networks will pick them up and run them as news, giving the ad millions of dollars of free air time. The most striking example would be the Willie Horton ad, which the press aired repeatedly (as an example of negative advertising) long after the ad had ceased running. (In fact, it never ran on the major networks as an ad, only as news.)       From a colorful, compact history of negative campaigning from Eisenhower to the present, to an in-depth commentary on the Willie Horton ads, to an up-to-the-minute analysis of the Duke-Edwards campaign in Louisiana, Dirty Politics is both a fascinating look at underhanded campaigning as well as a compelling argument for fair, accurate, and substantive campaigns. It is a book that all voters should read before they vote again.",

Belief touches every part of life; defining organizations, shaping trends, dividing families, and even igniting terrorism.BeliefWorks, Ray Dodd's follow up to The Power of Belief will turn your mind inside out, casting a fresh light on how we love, work, play, and what holds us back from the life we desire. Discover seven secret keys for unlocking the true power of belief and put this extraordinary force to work for you.",

        "Authors": "By Varmus, Harold and Weinberg, Robert A.",
        "Description": "When scientists investigate diseases, dysfunctions, and other abnormalities they often learn a great deal about the rules that govern normal life processes. This is especially true in the efforts to understand the origins of cancer - a search that has revealed much about the normal reproduction and development of cells. These revelations and their contributions to the fight against cancer are the focus of this elegantly written and illustrated volume.Genes and the Biology of Cancer brings together two of the most distinguished biomedical researchers working today - Harold Varmus and Robert Weinberg. In a book rich with insight and detail, they show how some of the beacons in the study of cancer have illuminated our understanding of normal biological function.What causes the fundamental controls of cellular growth to break down and the unrestrained, unpredictable proliferation characteristic of cancer to begin? Genes and the Biology of Cancer shows how scientists have explored that question by tracing carcinogenesis to its earliest detectable, submicroscopic stages. Drawing on classic and recent research findings, the authors explain how existing predispositions can work with any one of a number of factors (including sunlight, radiation, tobacco, and certain viral infections) to alter the genetic code radically, turning a normal gene into a cancer-causing one. They describe what we now know about the mechanisms of genes that seem to promote cancer (oncogenes) and those that prevent and restrain it (tumor suppressor genes). The authors conclude by looking ahead to possible means of controlling cancer, based upon current advances in research.Genes and the Biology of Cancer is a report from the front lines of one of the most crucial and exciting scientific undertakings of our time. From its exploration of the origins, nature, and mechanisms of carcinogenesis, readers will gain a deeper understanding of natural cellular development - and the dangers that result when the body's normal processes are disrupted or compromised.",

How does one dare yearn for something more, when so many workplaces seem aligned solely with financial survival and profit making? How do we get work done amidst the demands and tugs on our soul? Bringing Your Soul to Work addresses these troubling questions in a way that provides a pathway for readers who want to bridge the gap between their spiritual and work lives. It honors readers&apos; unique experiences and challenges them to think differently, aligning their actions with their hearts. Engaging, inspiring, and poetic, yet grounded in real life, this book is written by consultants who see the contradictions of the workplace firsthand. Using case examples, personal stories, inspirational quotes, visual images, reflective questions, and specific applications, it shows readers how to use their own experience to grapple with the gritty realities of the workplace. Throughout the book, readers are invited to consider the book&apos;s concepts in relation to their own unique situations and, in the case of the applications, to record their responses in writing. They then learn to construct meaning from their own experience, drawing on imagination and practice, as well as the specific circumstances of their work lives. Addressing what many feel but cannot say out loud, Bringing Your Soul to Work links ideas about soul to the realities of work in a unique way. For all those looking to increase their effectiveness at work and bring more feeling, imagination, and heart into their efforts with others, it will serve as a guide for creating something new and lasting.",

        "Title": "Lincoln in American Memory",
        "Authors": "By Peterson, Merrill D.",
        "Description": "Lincoln's death, like his life, was an event of epic proportions.  When the president was struck down at his moment of triumph, writes Merrill Peterson, \"sorrow--indescribable sorrow\" swept the nation. After lying in state in Washington, Lincoln's body was carried by a special funeral train to Springfield, Illinois, stopping in major cities along the way; perhaps a million people viewed the remains as memorial orations rang out and the world chorused its sincere condolences.  It was the apotheosis of the martyred President--the beginning of the transformation of a man into a mythic hero.      In Lincoln in American Memory, historian Merrill Peterson provides a fascinating history of Lincoln's place in the American imagination from the hour of his death to the present.  In tracing the changing image of Lincoln through time, this wide-ranging account offers insight into the evolution and struggles of American politics and society--and into the character of Lincoln himself. Westerners, Easterners, even Southerners were caught up in the idealization of the late President, reshaping his memory and laying claim to his mantle, as his widow, son, memorial builders, and memorabilia collectors fought over his visible legacy.  Peterson also looks at the complex responses of blacks to the memory of Lincoln, as they moved from exultation at the end of slavery to the harsh reality of free life amid deep poverty and segregation; at more than one memorial event for the great emancipator, the author notes, blacks were excluded.  He makes an engaging examination of the flood of reminiscences and biographies, from Lincoln's old law partner William H. Herndon to Carl Sandburg and beyond.  Serious historians were late in coming to the topic; for decades the myth-makers sought to shape the image of the hero President to suit their own agendas. He was made a voice of prohibition, a saloon-keeper, an infidel, a devout Christian, the first Bull Moose Progressive, a military blunderer and (after the First World War) a military genius, a white supremacist (according to D.W. Griffith and other Southern admirers), and a touchstone for the civil rights movement.  Through it all, Peterson traces five principal images of Lincoln: the savior of the Union, the great emancipator, man of the people, first American, and self-made man.  In identifying these archtypes, he tells us much not only of Lincoln but of our own identity as a people.      More than thirty years ago, Peterson won the prestigious Bancroft Prize for The Jefferson Image in the American Mind.  The New York Times Book Review hailed it as \"an engrossing story of the uses and abuses of a great legend,\" saying that Peterson's writing is often \"brilliant.\"  This absorbing book follows in the footsteps of that landmark work, leading us on a revealing tour through our changing image of our greatest president--and our changing image of ourselves.",

As middle age settles upon the Sharpe sisters, regret over chances not taken casts a shadow over their contented existence. Beatrice, a talented if uninspired pianist, gives up performing, a decision motivated by stiffening joints and the sudden realization that her art has never brought her someone to love. Miriam, usually calm and lucid, slides headlong into an affair with a charming, handsome--and very married--man. And as each woman awakens to the urgency of her loneliness, illness threatens to sever them both from the one happiness they have grown to count on: each other. Painfully wise, the Sharpe sisters embody the conflicting yearnings Jane Austen delineated in Sense and Sensibility.",

Revulsion is healthy. Each of us has limits, unarticulated boundaries of taste and tolerance, and sometimes we forget where they are. Peep Land is here to remind us; a fixed compass point by which we can govern our private behavior. Because being grossed out is essential to the human experience; without a perceived depravity, we'd have nothing against which to gauge the advance or decline of culture; our art, our music, our cinema, our books. Without sleaze, the yardstick shrinks at both ends. Team Rodent doesn't believe in sleaze, however, nor in old-fashioned revulsion. Square in the middle is where it wants us all to be, dependable consumers with predictable attitudes. The message, never stated but avuncularly implied, is that America's values ought to reflect those of the Walt Disney Company, and not the other way around.\"",

        "Description": "In his workbook, a New York City novelist records the contents of his teeming brain - sketches for stories, accounts of his love affairs, riffs on the meanings of popular songs, ideas for movies, obsessions with cosmic processes. He is a virtual repository of the predominant ideas and historical disasters of the age. But now he has found a story he thinks may become his next novel. The large brass cross that hung behind the alter of St. Timothy's, a run-down Episcopal church in lower Manhattan, has disappeared ... and even more mysteriously reappeared on the roof of the Synagogue for Evolutionary Judaism, on the Upper West Side. The church's maverick rector and the young woman rabbi who leads the synagogue are trying to learn who committed this strange double act of desecration and why. Befriending them, the novelist finds that their struggles with their respective traditions are relevant to the cast. Into his workbook go his taped interviews, insights, preliminary drafts ... and as he joins the clerics in pursuit of the mystery, it broadens to implicate a large cast of vividly drawn characters - including scientists, war veterans, prelates, Holocaust survivors, cabinet members, theologians, New York Times reporters, filmmakers, and crooners - in what proves to be a quest for an authentic spirituality at the end of this tortured century.",

        "Authors": "By Magretta, Joan and Stone, Nan Dundes",
        "Description": "\"This book will help managers in any type of organization, including nonprofits and the public sector, do their jobs better.\"  -- Michael E. Porter Harvard Business School  Whether you're new to the field or a seasoned executive, this book will give you a firm grasp on what it takes to make an organization perform. It presents the basic principles of management simply, but not simplistically. Why did an eBay succeed where a Webvan did not? Why do you need both a business model and a strategy? Why is it impossible to manage without the right performance measures, and do yours pass the test?  What Management Is is both a beginner's guide and a bible for one of the greatest social innovations of modern times: the discipline of management. Joan Magretta, a former top editor at the Harvard Business Review, distills the wisdom of a bewildering sea of books and articles into one simple, clear volume, explaining both the logic of successful organizations and how that logic is embodied in practice.  Magretta makes rich use of examples -- contemporary and historical -- to bring to life management's High Concepts: value creation, business models, competitive strategy, and organizational design. She devotes equal attention to the often unwritten rules of execution that characterize the best-performing organizations. Throughout she shows how the principles of management that work in for-profit businesses can -- and must -- be applied to nonprofits as well.  Most management books preach a single formula or a single fad. This one roams knowledgeably over the best that has been thought and written with a practical eye for what matters in real organizations. Not since Peter Drucker's great work of the 1950s and 1960s has there been a comparable effort to present the work of management as a coherent whole, to take stock of the current state of play, and to write about it thoughtfully for readers of all backgrounds. Newcomers will find the basics demystified. More experienced readers will recognize a store of useful wisdom and a framework for improving their own performance.  This is the big-picture management book for our times. It defines a common standard of managerial literacy that will help all of us lead more productive lives, whether we aspire to be managers or not.",

Suppressed by officials of the early Church, these sacred texts disappeared nearly two thousand years ago and were rediscovered unexpectedly in the 1940s in the desert south of Cairo. Around these remarkable events, Tucker Malarkey has crafted a suspenseful and eye-opening tale of love and war, religion and murder.When Gemma Bastian receives a telex that her archaeologist father has been found dead in Cairo, she flies from ravaged post-World War II London to Egypt to bury his ashes and close his affairs. While staying at the home of her father's oldest friend in Cairo, Gemma finds nothing is as it seems. She is both helped and hindered by David Lazar's handsome, enigmatic sons, half brothers who appeal to different parts of her war-weary heart.As Gemma sifts through her father's office at the Egyptian Museum, she is soon aware that her movements do not go unnoticed; she is being watched by at least one man who wants something her father had. As she stumbles clues to her father's last and most closely guarded project, she becomes convinced that his death was not natural, and that he was involved in a great archaeological discovery, one that many want to stay buried, one that might change the Christian world forever.Torn between brothers, beset by ominous warnings and threats to her safety, Gemma presses on in her investigation, finding herself caught in an intricate web of belief and betrayal in which she is fighting to rebuild not only her own shattered life but a faith that was lost to all of humanity. Here is the story of resurrection in its many forms: of a dead father, of a love between a man and a woman, of a world ravaged by war, of a faith that might have been.",
