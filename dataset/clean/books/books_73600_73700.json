If the issue is historical, they want their knowledge base refined. If the issue is sociopolitical, they want their preferences acknowledged. If the issue is popular culture, they want to be entertained. If it\u2019s a consumer issue, they don\u2019t want to be cheated. For the uninitiated, bracketol- ogy is, literally, \u201cthe study of brackets.\u201d It derives from the bracket format used to rank the top sixty-four basketball teams in the annual NCAA tournament known as March Madness. That knockout tournament format, the subject of heated debate among hundreds of thousands of people participating in office pools around the land, gave birth to the term bracketology. This is a book that allows Americans to play this game on a much bigger field. The authors have assigned more than 150 brackets\u2014tackling challenges from the serious to the comic, the vital to the trivial\u2014to the finest experts, writers, and personalities this country has on tap. \u2022 It\u2019s authoritative: So imagine: Gail Collins on First Ladies, Walter Isaacson on Ben Franklin Wisdom, David Remnick on Pound-for-Pound-fighters, Calvin Trillin on Sandwiches\u2014you get the picture.

The European Union was put into place incrementally over fifty years, not by the citizens of the member states, but by the efforts of an intellectual elite who disguised their ultimate goal of a regional government. Today, a bloated, unelected bureaucracy rules over hundreds of millions of people\u2014people who have no say over the EU\u2019s actions...or their own futures. Think it could never happen here? According to author Jerome Corsi, it already has.  The Security and Prosperity Partnership\u2014announced in 2005 by the leaders of Mexico, the U.S., and Canada, but never presented to Congress for approval\u2014is already laying the groundwork for the merger of the three nations into a North American Union. Here, in The Late Great U.S.A, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Obama Nation makes a boldly provocative argument about the future of our country, in this important book that was, in part, the inspiration for the final chapter in Glenn Beck\u2019s #1 New York Times bestseller An Inconvenient Book.",

Mimi and her husband Ralph have left social climbing, pushy parenting, and their marital problems behind them in London in favor of perfect, bucolic tranquility. Or so they thought. The village of Honeybourne has mud, masses of fresh air, and handsome hayseeds in abundance, but what should be rural heaven turns out to be just as tricky to navigate as Notting Hell, even with Mimi\u2019s new best friend Rose\u2014Dorset\u2019s answer to Martha Stewart\u2014by her side. Mimi can get by without world-class restaurants, spas, and vintage markets, but living without central heating is another challenge entirely. And while Honeybourne is thankfully free of prestigious preschools with waiting lists that begin in utero, it has its own fierce brand of competition\u2014between landowners and eco-warriors, Old Money and No Money, Ralph Lauren-sporting racehorses and Barbour-wearing brood mares. Without a helipad for trophy guests, an organic farm shop, and a bottom that looks good in jodphurs, Mimi is at a distinct disadvantage. And that\u2019s just the start of her problems, because Mimi also has a secret she must keep to save her marriage. With a gimlet eye for telling details and human foibles, Rachel Johnson has crafted a novel that is fresh, hilarious, and irresistibly funny\u2014a brilliant slice of social satire with surprising depth and heart.",

        "Authors": "By Gabriel, Jon",
        "Description": "Author Jon Gabriel uses his own remarkable transformation\u2014from 409 pounds to 184 pounds\u2014to show the solution to changing the inner belief systems that keep our bodies from thin.The pile of recent dieting books is growing faster than the average American's waistline. From the well-known programs that deprive and restrict to ones that rely on juice alone, it seems that everybody has an answer to the growing problem of obesity. When Jon Gabriel's life took an unexpected turn, he suddenly was awakened to the marvelous gift that he had been given -- the opportunity to live -- and was disgusted at how he had treated his body. At over four hundred pounds, walking, sleeping, and working was a struggle against gravity, and his life was a constant battle between emotional and physical satiation. He was slowly killing himself with food. Like the estimated 58 percent of Americans, and rising numbers in other countries, Jon was trapped in what he came to call the FAT - Famine and Temperature - trap. By studying biochemistry, Gabriel learned that your body has an internal logic that determines how fat or thin you will be at any given time. The way to lose weight is not to struggle or to force yourself to lose weight but to understand this internal logic and work with it so that your body wants to be thinner. When your body wants to be thinner, weight loss is inevitable and becomes automatic and effortless. You simply crave less food, you crave healthier foods, your metabolism speeds up and you become very efficient at burning fat, just like a naturally thin person. And that's the real transformation -- to transform yourself into a naturally thin person, so that you can eat whatever you want whenever you want and still be thin, fit, and vibrantly healthy. After reading The Gabriel Method, you will learn: -Your body has a reason why it's holding on to weight--and it's not your fault. -Fat is a cushion--a protective barrier that our mind believes is helping to protect us. -If you can change that belief, you can change your body; Stop the cycle of crash dieting and start eating what you want, when you want it. -How to choose healthy, nutritious foods that nourish the cells in your body, not starve them. -Delicious shakes and smoothies, and super-power supplements, that can jump start your success. -The simple way you can train your mind and body to work with your goal of health, not against it. -Eliminate the emotional and mental reasons your body holds on to weight in just 10 minutes a day. It certainly worked for Jon; he lost 225 pounds in two-and-a-half years, going from 409 pounds to 184, without suffering, dieting, or anguishing over his body. Unlike most people who lose an extensive amount of weight, his skin tightened up and now is indistinguishable from that of a person who has been healthy his whole life.",

        "Description": "From three-time New York Times bestselling author Christopher Rice -- whose novels have been called \"bold and ambitious\" by The New York Times, \"chillingly perverse\" by USA Today, and \"shocking, sexy...intricate\" by Glamour -- comes this startling psychological thriller about an Iraq War vet who seeks redemption and revenge when a fellow Marine he failed to protect during the war is brutally murdered.   John Houck became a Marine to become a hero. But his life changed when he failed to notice an explosive device that ended up maiming the captain of his Force Recon Company, a respected Marine who nearly sacrificed himself to save John's life.   Home from Iraq, John pays a visit to his former captain, only to discover the captain has been gruesomely murdered. John pursues a strange man he sees running from the scene, but he discovers that Alex Martin is not the murderer. Alex is, in fact, the former captain's secret male lover and the killer's intended next victim.   When it becomes clear that local law enforcement has direct connections to the murder itself, John realizes that to repay his debt of honor, he must teach Alex Martin how to protect himself, even if that means teaching Alex to kill. In the process, John confronts the painful truth about the younger brother he was unable to protect and the older sister he always felt he failed.   Blind Fall is a story of honor and integrity, of turning failure into victory. It is a stunning departure for Christopher Rice: the story of two men, one a Marine, one gay, who must unite to avenge the death of the man they both loved -- one as a brother-in-arms, one as a lover -- and to survive.",

Promised a crown when she reaches the eighth square, Alice perseveres through a surreal landscape of amusing characters that pelt her with riddles and humorous semantic quibbles and regale her with memorable poetry, including the oft-quoted \"Jabberwocky.\"This handsome, inexpensive edition, featuring the original John Tenniel illustrations, makes available to today's readers a classic of juvenile literature long cherished for its humor, whimsy, and incomparable fantasy.",

        "Description": "Get Your Body Ready for the Marathon of Labor!  If you're newly pregnant, you're probably watching your diet carefully, getting plenty of rest, and preparing for the arrival of your new baby. You're also thinking about the big day itself and what the experience of labor will be like. Even if you're following a regular fitness program, you'll want to do everything you can to strengthen and prepare your body for the rigors of labor.  Maternal Fitness features clearly illustrated exercises that focus specifically on the muscle groups you'll use throughout labor, especially the transverse abdominals -- the stomach muscles that play a critical role during delivery. A powerful set of transverse abs can speed labor and delivery and make for a quick recovery. By learning how to strengthen your abdominals and relax your pelvic floor muscles, you'll be able to push more effectively.  While the Maternal Fitness program is designed specifically for the big moment, it also has other benefits, from minimizing backache and fatigue to giving you a welcome head start on getting back into shape after childbirth. Developed by a professional trainer who is also a registered nurse and childbirth educator, the Maternal Fitness program is safe for you and your baby and easy to do. Once learned, it can be incorporated into any workout.",

When her husband accepted a job teaching English in Nagoya, Japan, she imagined exotic weekend getaways, fine sushi dinners, and sake sojourns with glamorous expatriate friends. Instead, she's the only Jewish girl on public transportation, and everyone is staring. Lisa longs for regular mani/pedis, valet parking, and gimlets with her girlfriends, but for the next year, she learns to cook, clean, commute, and shop like the Japanese, all the while adjusting to another foreign concept -- marriage. Loneliness and frustration give way to new and unexpected friendships, the evolution of old ones, and a fresh understanding of what it means to feel different -- until finally a world she never thought she'd fit into begins to feel home-like, if not exactly like home.",

        "Authors": "By Kent, George O.",
        "Description": "A new account of the life and policies of the first German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, this concise historical-biography reflects, for the first time in English, the historical shift in emphasis from the traditional political-economic approach to the more complex social-economic one of post\u2014World War II scholarship. Since the middle of the 1950s, much new material on Bismarck and nine\u00adteenth-century Germany and new inter\u00adpretations of existing material have been published in Germany, Great Britain, and the United States. Pro\u00adfessor George O. Kent\u2019s brilliant syn\u00adthesis, drawing on this mass of mate\u00adrial, examines changes in emphasis in post\u2014World War II scholarship. The book, particularly in the historiograph\u00adical notes and bibliographical essay, provides the serious student with an invaluable guide to the intricacies of recent Bismarckian scholarship. For the general reader, the main text presents a picture of the man, the issues, and the age in the light of modern scholarship. The major shift in historical emphasis described in this new account is the importance scholars give to the period 1877\u201379, the years of change from free trade to protectionism, rather than to 1870\u201371 the founding of the Reich. Bismarck\u2019s political machinations, par\u00adticularly his willingness to explore the possibilities of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, are more fully discussed here than in any other book.",

        "Title": "At the Point of a Gun: Democratic Dreams and Armed Intervention",
        "Authors": "By Rieff, David",
        "Description": "Writing from the front lines of the hot wars of the post-Cold War world -- the Balkans, Africa, the Middle East, and most recently Afghanistan and Iraq for The New York Times Magazine -- David Rieff witnessed firsthand most of the armed interventions waged by the West or the United Nations in the name of human rights and democratization. His report is anything but reassuring. In this timely collection of his most illuminating articles, Rieff, one of our leading experts on the subject, reassesses some of his own judgments about the use of military might to solve the world's most pressing humanitarian problems and curb the world's cruelest human rights abusers, presenting what, taken as a whole, is a thoughtful and impassioned argument against armed intervention in all but the most extreme cases.  At the Point of a Gun raises critical questions we cannot ignore in this era of gunboat democracy. When, if ever, is it appropriate to intervene militarily in the domestic affairs of other nations? Are human rights and humanitarian concerns legitimate reasons for intervening, or is the assault on sovereignty -- sovereignty that is as much an article of faith at the UN as it is in Washington -- a flag of convenience for the recolonization of part of the world? What role should the United Nations play in alleviating humanitarian crises? And, above all, can democracy be imposed through the barrel of an M16?  Collected here for the first time, Rieff's essays draw a searing portrait of what happens when the grandiose schemes of policymakers and the grandiose ethical ambitions of human rights activists go horribly wrong in the field. Again and again, they ask the question: Do these moral ambitions of ours to protect people from massacre and want match either our means or our wisdom?  Rieff's articles appear as they were written. Some, however, are accompanied by brief reconsiderations in which the author describes how and why his thinking has changed both as he has reflected on what it means, as in Iraq, to impose democracy by force, and as he has witnessed, firsthand, what that redemptive project actually looks like in practice.  This is not an optimistic report. To the contrary, it is the chastened conclusion of a writer who was once one of the leading advocates of such interventions. But the questions Rieff raises are of the essence as the United States grapples with the harsh consequences of what it has wrought on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq.",

It's Mean Girls meets Lord of the Flies, and it marks the debut of an innovative new voice in fiction.  Anna Wheeler's parents have had it up to here. They can't seem to control their daughter anymore and so, one night, Anna's yanked from her bed and carted off to Camp Archstone -- bootcamp for troubled teen girls. There, on a vast, remote, sparsely populated island, Anna will be expected to change her ways and repent for the sins her religious father just can't seem to forgive. Here's a hint: There's a boy involved. No, a man.  Life at Camp Archstone is Anna's worst nightmare. Every minute of the day is scheduled, the counselors are hardcore, and one girl is crueler than the next. But when a grueling hike into the forest goes horribly wrong, things go from bad to worse. Stalked by an unknown foe and left to fend for themselves, the girls band together to try to find their way back to civilization -- and that's when the real trouble begins.",

A hero in Israel's wars, perhaps the most daring and successful commander in Israel's extraordinary military history, Sharon has always been a warrior, whether the enemies were hostile Arab nations, terrorists, Time magazine, or rival politicians. The public man is well known -- aggressive in battle, hard-line in politics -- but the private man has always been obscured by Sharon's dazzling career and powerful personality. In this compelling and dramatic auto-biography, the real Sharon appears for the first time: a complex man, a loving father, a figure of courage and compassion. He is a warrior who commands the respect and love of his troops, a visionary, and an uncompromising, ruthless pragmatist.  Sharon tells his story with frankness, power, intelligence, and a brilliant gift for detail. Always controversial, he is as outspoken as his friends -- and enemies -- would expect him to be.",

But late one stormy summer night, when her husband, Sam, is away on one of his frequent business trips, Claire's fears come to life. She discovers an intruder has broken into her young daughter's bedroom. She watches helplessly as he picks up her sleeping child from her bed. Desperate to protect her family, Claire puts herself in the line of fire and utters the plea that will undo her: \"Take me instead.\"   As she drives away in the kidnapper's car, Claire fears for her children, but not for herself. And she can't help noticing the reversal in her marriage -- for the first time in ten years, Sam will not know where she is.   For the next week, Claire is tied to a bed in a strange motel room, the intruder her only com-panion. She is forced to lie still and contemplate the reasons for this assault on her family. Is this just a random crime, or something more sinister? Has the shadowy past that she tried so hard to leave behind finally caught up with her? Day after day, she goes deeper into herself, reevaluating her marriage and her role as a mother, and unburying the source of her crippling anxiety. In seven days she will step out to the very brink of her soul -- perhaps never to return.   A riveting debut novel that will appeal to fans of Sue Miller and Janet Fitch, Standing Still is a powerful exploration of the darker side of mother-hood and marriage.",
