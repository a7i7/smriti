        "Title": "Fire Lover: A True Story",
        "Authors": "By Wambaugh, Joseph",
        "Description": "From master crime writer Joseph Wambaugh, the acclaimed author of such classics as The Onion Field and The Choirboys, comes the extraordinary true story of a firefighter who may have been, according to U.S. government profilers, \"the most prolific American arsonist of the twentieth century.\"Growing up in Los Angeles, John Orr would watch in awe as firefighters scrambled to put out blazes with seeming disregard for their own lives. One day he would become a fireman himself, and a good one. As a member of the Glendale Fire Department, he rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a fire captain and one of southern California's best-known and most-respected arson investigators, as well as a writer of firefighting articles and finally of a fact-based novel. But there was another, unseen life, one that included many women, a need for risk, and a hunger for recognition.While Orr busted a string of petty arsonists, there was one serial criminal he could not track down. The fire lover used the same simple yet devastating device and was unerring in his execution. His lethal handiwork led to the death of four innocent people and countless millions of dollars worth of property damage. Homes, retail stores during business hours, fields of dry brush in stifling summer heat -- little was safe from his obsession to see them burn.But after years of terror and destruction, he would make a mistake. He would leave behind a precious clue that investigators would use to lead them to the true identity of the fire lover, to the shock and disbelief of the firefighting community.Chilling, colorful, and vivid, Fire Lover is Joseph Wambaugh at his best. He explores the making of a deviant personality, the fascinating intricacies of fire science, the uneasy relationship between firefighting and law-enforcement communities, and a legal system gone haywire.  Based on his trademark meticulous research, interviews, case records, and thousands of pages of court transcripts, Wambaugh fashions a powerful narrative. You will never look at fire the same way again.",

        "Description": "The Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author of All Over but the Shoutin\u2019 continues his personal history of the Deep South with an evocation of his mother\u2019s childhood in the Appalachian foothills during the Great Depression, and the magnificent story of the man who raised her.Charlie Bundrum was a roofer, a carpenter, a whiskey-maker, a fisherman who knew every inch of the Coosa River, made boats out of car hoods and knew how to pack a wound with brown sugar to stop the blood. He could not read, but he asked his wife, Ava, to read him the paper every day so he would not be ignorant. He was a man who took giant steps in rundown boots, a true hero whom history would otherwise have overlooked.In the decade of the Great Depression, Charlie moved his family twenty-one times, keeping seven children one step ahead of the poverty and starvation that threatened them from every side. He worked at the steel mill when the steel was rolling, or for a side of bacon or a bushel of peaches when it wasn\u2019t. He paid the doctor who delivered his fourth daughter, Margaret\u2014Bragg\u2019s mother\u2014with a jar of whiskey. He understood the finer points of the law as it applied to poor people and drinking men; he was a banjo player and a buck dancer who worked off fines when life got a little sideways, and he sang when he was drunk, where other men fought or cussed. He had a talent for living.  His children revered him. When he died, cars lined the blacktop for more than a mile.Rick Bragg has built a soaring monument to the grandfather he never knew\u2014a father who stood by his family in hard times and left a backwoods legend behind\u2014in a book that blazes with his love for his family, and for a particular stretch of dirt road along the Alabama-Georgia border. A powerfully intimate piece of American history as it was experienced by the working people of the Deep South, a glorious record of a life of character, tenacity and indomitable joy and an unforgettable tribute to a vanishing culture, Ava\u2019s Man is Rick Bragg at his stunning best.",

And then, 81 days into the campaign, he was assassinated. Now, in The Gospel According to RFK, writer Norman MacAfee has brought together for the first time the best of Kennedy's presidential campaign speeches and contributes lively and engaging commentary that makes them fresh, relevant, and especially timely.",

        "Description": "A must-read for every woman in the midst of\u2014or contemplating\u2014a career in law, and for the men who work with them. \u00a0 The very presence of women in law\u2014normal as it may seem to us today\u2014signals revolutionary change in a social order that for centuries entrusted control over its rules to men. Mona Harrington examines both the problems women meet when they claim equal authority as rule makers and the impact of new perspectives and issues that women bring with them into the profession. \u00a0 On the basis of more than one hundred interviews with women lawyers, judges, and law school professors and students, and through the stories of their daily experiences, Harrington pinpoints and analyzes the key factors holding women back in a profession still dominated by males\u2014among them the \u201cmen\u2019s club\u201d ambience, the focus on billable hours, sexual harassment and the inequality it perpetuates, lingering unequal division of labor at home, and hostile media images of women in positions of power.\u00a0 \u00a0 She shows us what life is like for women lawyers in practice today and how their dilemmas reflect the social issues of our time. She gives us the voices of women who have adapted to the cultural codes of corporate law and women who have broken them; women who have successfully balanced their professional and private lives and women who feel trapped by the combination of long hours at the office and full responsibility at home. She introduces us to women in new and alternative firms, on the faculties of small public law schools, in in-house legal departments, and in prosecutors\u2019 offices and courtrooms\u2014women who are devising new rules and legal theories to bring about change.",

        "Title": "Personal Witness: Israel through My Eyes",
        "Authors": "By Eban, Abba Solomon",
        "Description": "Personal Witness, as its title indicates, is the passionate account of Israel's first five decades, written by one of its founding fathers, and it is both an objective and a subjective assessment of those history-making years. It is also the subject of a five-part PBS series to be broadcast in the United States and many other countries.Personal Witness is a political and social history of the highest level, presented without fear or favor - a glaringly candid testament written at a time when Eban is not restrained by the formalities of office or diplomatic niceties. Here you may meet Abba Eban, the man behind the statesman, writer, orator and historian - the man who said, \"Men and nations sometimes behave wisely, once they have exhausted all the other alternatives.\"In the style that has won him renown, Eban traces Israel through all the fluctuations of its fortunes to which he was a witness and a participant: from its embattled beginnings and first struggle for international recognition, when \"Israel held the joy of birth and the fear of death in a single taste\"; through the successive wars and diplomatic crises, in which he was frequently a central spokesman and policymaker; to the dreams and often bitter conflicts of today.Along the way come splendid sidelights - reactions not only to events but to people, the men and women who strove to create Israel, and the international leaders who helped or hindered them. In intimate, often surprising vignettes, Eban depicts the world leaders he has encountered over more than four decades, offering frank comments on every American president from Truman (\"If there was such a thing as an 'imperial presidency,' no one seemed to have broken the news to Harry S. Truman\") to Bush; on leaders from Churchill, de Gaulle and Kohl to Sadat and King Hussein; and on the Jewish and Israeli gallery, from Ben-Gurion and Meir to Begin, Rabin and Shamir.In 1984, Heritage: Civilization and the Jews, Eban's enormously successful account of the history of the Jewish people up to 1948, appeared as a nine-part television series on public television and a colorful and evocative companion book of the same name. Now, in a shifting of gears, comes Personal Witness, and Eban on Israel is an extraordinary pairing of writer and subject - pointed, knowledgeable, alive with drama and humor, and above all, intensely personal. Throughout, Eban's eye is clear, his perspective humane, his voice rich and dramatic, and his vision sweeping. Indispensable as history, irresistible as memoir, it is a book for anyone who cares about the destiny of Israel and the Middle East.",

Isikoff had no agenda when he started investigating President Clinton's conduct other than to get at the truth. But as he battled skeptical editors and a formidable White House spin machine, Isikoff unwittingly became a primary character in the unfolding drama.Beyond the remarkable case of journalistic detective work, Isikoff provides something even more significant: a work that illuminates the psychologically troubling behavior of a president, an Administration that has enabled his actions, a motley crew of Clinton-haters who would stop at nothing to topple the president, and a rapidly changing media grappling with the ever-shifting boundaries between public and private behaviors. Uncovering Clinton will surely be the definitive account of our nation's biggest political scandal since Watergate.",

Now Jack is a retired Los Angeles homicide detective living in the nearly nonexistent hamlet of Tamarack, WI. He has no recollection of his adventures in the Territories and was compelled to leave the police force when an odd, happenstance event threatened to awaken those memories.When a series of gruesome murders occur in western Wisconsin that are reminiscent of those committed several decades earlier by a real-life madman named Albert Fish, the killer is dubbed \"The Fisherman\" and Jack's buddy, the local chief of police, begs Jack to help his inexperienced force find him. But is this merely the work of a disturbed individual, or has a mysterious and malignant force been unleashed in this quiet town? What causes Jack's inexplicable waking dreams, if that is what they are, of robins' eggs and red feathers? It's almost as if someone is trying to tell him something. As that message becomes increasingly impossible to ignore, Jack is drawn back to the Territories and to his own hidden past, where he may find the soul-strength to enter a terrifying house at the end of a deserted track of forest, there to encounter the obscene and ferocious evils sheltered within it.",

        "Description": "Welcome to the bully pulpit where opinions fly but common sense rules. Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll find straight talk about the most pressing issues of the day, all delivered in the trademark commonsense style of one of America\u2019s most popular and admired television news anchors. Always resisting the political label that attempts to place people in one ideological camp or another, Greta Van Susteren speaks from the mind and the heart, not as a liberal or a conservative, but as a right-thinking, sensible citizen. \u201cOur country is at a critical juncture,\u201d she writes, and \u201ctoo many of us are caught up in old definitions of left and right that no longer apply. If I favor the death penalty in some cases, does that make me right-wing? If I think hate crimes legislation is stupid, does that make me a conservative? If I happen to like and enjoy Ozzy Osbourne and have him on my show, does that make me a liberal? And if I believe that corporations should be held accountable if their products harm citizens and they should be subject to the rulings of a jury\u2014ditto for doctors who commit medical malpractice\u2014does that make me a lefty trial lawyer?\u201dHere\u2019s more of Greta in her own words:On the military: Liberty isn\u2019t free. As a nation, we must provide for the men and women who put their lives on the line for us. That means good pay, adequate funding for defense, and our heartfelt support. Vietnam was a very long time ago. We Baby Boomers have to wake up and realize that today\u2019s military is a different military from the one we grew up with, and we are fighting a very different war. Patriotism is not a conservative or a liberal thing. Patriotism, as far as I am concerned, is the duty and obligation of every American.On the Supreme Court: There should be a litmus test for Supreme Court and federal court judges, and that test should be their opinion about allowing public access to court proceedings. Let cameras inside the courthouse, or at least allow an audio feed to radio. What are they hiding?On the death penalty: It should be legal and available to courts and juries . . . but it should be used extremely rarely, and only when we are absolutely certain that a fair trial has taken place.On how you look: It\u2019s your business and nobody else\u2019s. Your looks and your life are not a democracy\u2014not everybody gets a vote. Make your appearance and your choices a totalitarian regime\u2014you are the boss.On fun: It isn\u2019t a curse word. It\u2019s actually quite serious business, as it makes the hard times livable and the sad times bearable. Fun should be part of a work environment, too. Stuffed shirts and snobs who can\u2019t stop and laugh at themselves should be banished!In Greta\u2019s company you\u2019re guaranteed to get a fresh dose of common sense and a good hearty rant on many of the most important issues we face today. One more guarantee: you\u2019ll have some good fun while you\u2019re at it.",

In assessing the subsequent debate about the budget and \"big government,\" Darman laments the decline of the political center. He holds both President Clinton and House Speaker Gingrich accountable for the politics of polarization and stalemate that have made it seem as if no one is in control in Washington.",

Her dignity and perseverance in bringing her husband's killer to justice - a battle she waged for more than thirty years - have made her an inspiration and role model for millions of women of all ages and races.Yet few people know the private side of this most remarkable of public lives, a side that Myrlie Evers-Williams shares for the first time in Watch Me Fly. Here is a moving and vivid portrait of a childhood within a family of proud, determined Mississippi women; of the harrowing dangers her family faced during the civil rights struggle; of her efforts as a single mother to raise three children while attending college, efforts that left her battling depression; of her opening her heart to another wonderful man, only to lose him to cancer; and of her path from business and civic careers to her brilliant leadership of the NAACP through scandal to a newfound vitality.Watch Me Fly is not just a traditional memoir, however, but what Myrlie Evers-Williams calls an \"instructive autobiography,\" a book that links her memories to the wisdom she has gained over the years.",

Shore provides not only inspiration but also lucid directions for the journey from traditional politics to a more direct and powerful way of connecting to our communities and, through them, to the people in our lives and to ourselves.His is a two-part strategy: First, he calls on the nonprofit sector to become self-sustaining by creating new wealth with the same aggressive financial acumen essential to any business. Second, he calls on us as citizens to assume responsibility for the next generation by becoming personally involved with those in need - not through the donation of our own \"leftover wealth,\" but through the contribution of skills, talent, and time.In Share Our Strength he has created a revolutionary organization which has grown in one decade to a $30 million grant-giving operation that takes none of its funding from the government, and in so doing he has reinvented the traditional notion of a nonprofit that survives on foundation grants and private donations. Instead, Share Our Strength generates new wealth through entrepreneurial ventures - corporate marketing partnerships and the sale of goods and services - that exploit the forces and demands of the marketplace for greater good. Share Our Strength and a number of other innovative organizations are at the forefront of a new breed: the nonprofit run for profit. Money made is reinvested in community-based projects and programs that directly serve those in need.",

In Vermont, a young woman watching her favorite sitcom meets the same grisly fate, as does a group of sewer workers in Washington, D.C.  Whatever has killed these people is spreading fast and the task of eradicating it falls to young virologist Samantha Craig and paramedic Nick Barnes, whose brilliant surgical career was ruined by a crippling hand injury.When Nick and Samantha discover that the virus, named Reaper, is spread through TVs and PCs, they realize that the information superhighway will become a killing field, with tens of millions dead, unless they can root Reaper out.  Their search employs a dazzling array of real-life wizardry, from Mylar body paint to Stealth helicopters to CIA-bred swarms of insects. At the core of Reaper&#39;s madness, they find a suavely megalomaniacal, up-from-the-slums, high-tech billionaire; and a high-powered cabal that will do anything to save the world from technology, even if that means annihilating the world.Drawing on the latest medical and technological research and folding in deftly realized characters, Ben Mezrich crafts a relentless, page-turning tale that is at once cutting-edge and utterly believable.",

        "Description": "When Alexandra (\"Bo\") Fuller was home in Zambia a few years ago, visiting her parents for Christmas, she asked her father about a nearby banana farmer who was known for being a \"tough bugger.\" Her father's response was a warning to steer clear of him; he told Bo: \"Curiosity scribbled the cat.\" Nonetheless, Fuller began her strange friendship with the man she calls K, a white African and veteran of the Rhodesian war. With the same fiercely beautiful prose that won her acclaim forDon't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, Fuller here recounts her friendship with K.K is, seemingly, a man of contradictions: tattooed, battle scarred, and weathered by farm work, he is a lion of a man, feral and bulletproof. Yet he is also a born-again Christian, given to weeping when he recollects his failed romantic life, and more than anything else welling up inside with memories of battle. For his war, like all wars, was a brutal one, marked by racial strife, jungle battles, unimaginable tortures, and the murdering of innocent civilians\u2014and K, like all the veterans of the war, has blood on his hands.Driven by K's memories, Fuller and K decide to enter the heart of darkness in the most literal way\u2014by traveling from Zambia through Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) and Mozambique to visit the scenes of the war and to meet other veterans. It is a strange journey into the past, one marked at once by somber reflections and odd humor and featuring characters such as Mapenga, a fellow veteran who lives with his pet lion on a little island in the middle of a lake and is known to cope with his personal demons by refusing to speak for days on end. What results from Fuller's journey is a remarkably unbiased and unsentimental glimpse of men who have killed, mutilated, tortured, and scrambled to survive during wartime and who now must attempt to live with their past and live past their sins. In these men, too, we get a glimpse of life in Africa, a land that besets its creatures with pests, plagues, and natural disasters, making the people there at once more hardened and more vulnerable than elsewhere.Scribbling the Cat is an engrossing and haunting look at war, Africa, and the lines of sanity.",

SECOND CHANCEAs editor-in-chief of New York\u2019s leading fashion magazine, Fiona Monaghan lived a life as hectic and high-toned as the fashion world itself, jetting back and forth between her stylish Manhattan brownstone and the couture shows of Europe. With closets stuffed with Fendi, a snoring bulldog named Sir Winston sharing her bed, and a houseman who favors gold lam\u00e9 and borrows her shoes, Fiona was utterly content with her life. Until the sweltering June day John Anderson strolled into her office. After a dinner date left them both wanting more, Fiona impulsively invited John to the Paris couture shows. And in the most romantic city in the world, somewhere between the magic of the runway and the stroll along the Seine, Fiona let this man into her heart. A widower with two daughters, John Anderson was nearly Fiona\u2019s opposite in every way. As conservative as she was freewheeling, John was both amused and appalled by Fiona\u2019s world of high-strung designers, anorexic models, and high-heeled housemen. But within weeks of their return to New York, John was making friends with Sir Winston\u2014and Fiona was making room in her closets. It didn\u2019t take long for the dominoes to start falling.

Solo planes evolved into two-seaters, then into ones capable of carrying entire squadrons. But, as aircraft gained speed and altitude, the trend reversed, and with the advent of supersonic technology, air warfare has come full circle--back to single numbers. The top-scoring Allied Fighter Pilot of World War Two chronicles the achievements of the greatest fliers of both sides, who played a big part in shaping the course of combat.",

        "Description": "In this volume, distinguished Chinese and Western scholars provide a detailed examination of the problems associated with China's transition to a market-oriented system. A variety of reform proposals, aimed at resolving the contradictions inherent in piecemeal reform, are discussed along with the chances for future liberalization. These clearly written and insightful essays address the roots of China's crisis. The authors focus on institutional changes necessary for a spontaneous market order and point to the close relation between economic reform and political-constitutional reform. Topics include the speed and degree of the transition, whether ownership reform must precede price reform, how inflation can be avoided, steps to depoliticize economic life, how to create an environment conducive to foreign trade and investment, and how to institute basic constitutional change and open China to the outside world. The revolutionary changes now shaking the foundations of socialism and central planning in the Soviet Union and Eastern and Central Europe are sure to have an impact on China's future. Despite their seriousness, the events of Tiananmen Square may constitute only a temporary detour on the road toward a private market order. The essays in this volume help lay a rational framework for understanding China's present problems and for discussing the prospects for future reform.",

I'm the one who sat in a folding chair out in the hall selling tickets to the prom but never going, the one everybody liked but no one wanted to be with.  A self-anointed spinster at fifty-one, Myra Lipinsky has endured the isolation of her middle life by doting on her dog, Frank, and immersing herself in her career as a visiting nurse. Myra considers herself reasonably content, telling herself, It's enough, work and Frank. And it has been enough -- until Chip Reardon, the too-good-to-be-true golden boy she adored from afar, is assigned to be her new patient. Choosing to forgo invasive treatment for an incurable illness, Chip has returned from Manhattan to the New England home ofhis childhood to spend what time he has left. Now, Myra and Chip find themselves engaged in a poingnant redefinition of roles, and a complicated dance of memory, ambivalence, and longing.   From the author whose work The New Yorker calls \"strong\" and \"timeless\" comes a wry and beautifully distilled portrait of one woman's resilience in the face of loneliness, and of a union that transcends life's most unexpected and challenging circumstances. With effortless warmth, and loving respect for characters that defies easy sentiment, Never Change melds the emotional depth and gentle intensity of poetry with the rich satisfactions of finely wrought fiction.",

        "Description": "The China of the 1990s is a country of profound contradictions: Maoist ideology coexists with an entrepreneurial spirit that has made China one of the world's economic powerhouses; a rebellious, irreverent popular culture thrives in the shadow of a totalitarian political system; a nihilistic subculture coexists alongside ancient traditions of obedience, conformity, and respect for tradition.  In Mandate of Heaven Orville Schell, one of America's foremost China specialists, interprets these conflicting developments and brilliantly documents the new power structures, economic initiatives, and cultural changes that have transformed China since the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989. Schell takes readers on a series of journeys inside this latter-day People's Republic and introduces us to a broad spectrum of people, from students and workers to entrepreneurs, pop stars, and party officials, who, although they acted out the drama of the Square, are now playing the prominent roles in China's high-speed economic rush into the future.  As China's role on the world stage grows, it becomes increasingly important that the West acquaint itself with the people who will be leading it into the twenty-first century. Mandate of Heaven is the authoritative and definitive account of this generation as it moves into a capitalist economic future while still clinging to the structures of its communist past.",

In short, she's fed up, restless, and ready for an adventure. Sissy just never imagined temptation would come into her life that breathless summer day as she sat smoking on her porch swing. For although she may have been fixated on the taut muscles of the lineman shimmying down the telephone pole across the street, she hadn't allowed herself to imagine that he'd be none other than her high school sweetheart, Parker Davidson, who left town fourteen years before without so much as a wave good-bye. But suddenly, here he is, leaning in for a kiss that will stir up more excitement than Sissy could ever have imagined...",

        "Title": "The Civil War: An Illustrated History",
        "Authors": "By Ward, Geoffrey C.",
        "Description": "The companion volume to the celebrated PBS television series, with a new preface to mark its twenty-fifth anniversary \u00a0 With more than 500 illustrations: rare Civil War photographs\u2014many never before published\u2014as well as paintings, lithographs, and maps reproduced in full color  \u00a0 It was the greatest war in American history. It was waged in 10,000 places\u2014from Valverde, New Mexico, and Tullahoma, Tennessee, to St. Albans, Vermont, and Fernandina on the Florida coast. More than 3 million Americans fought in it and more than 600,000 men died in it. Not only the immensity of the cataclysm but the new weapons, the new standards of generalship, and the new strategies of destruction\u2014together with the birth of photography\u2014were to make the Civil War an event present ever since in the American consciousness. Thousands of books have been written about it. Yet there has never been a history of the Civil War quite like this one.  \u00a0 A wealth of documentary illustrations and a narrative alive with original and energetic scholarship combine to present both the grand sweep of events and the minutest of human details. Here are the crucial events of the war: the firing of the first shots at Fort Sumter; the battles of Shiloh, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg; the siege of Vicksburg; Sherman\u2019s dramatic march to the sea; the surrender at Appomattox. Here are the superb portraits of the key figures: Abraham Lincoln, claiming for the presidency almost autocratic power in order to preserve the Union; the austere Jefferson Davis, whose government disappeared almost before it could be formed; Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant, seasoned generals of fierce brilliance and reckless determination. Here is the America in which the war was fought: The Civil War is not simply the story of great battles and great generals; it is also an elaborate portrait of the American people\u2014individuals and families, northerners and southerners, soldiers and civilians, slaves and slaveowners, rich and poor, urban and rural\u2014caught up in the turbulence of the times.  \u00a0 An additional resonance is provided by four essays, the work of prominent Civil War historians. Don E. Fehrenbacher discusses the causes of the war; Barbara J. Fields writes about emancipation; James M. McPherson looks at the politics of the 1864 election; C. Vann Woodward speculates on how the war has affected the American identity. And Shelby Foote talks to filmmaker Ken Burns about wartime life on the battlefield and at home.  \u00a0 A magnificent book. In its visual power, its meticulous research, its textual brilliance, and the humanity of its narrative, The Civil War will stand among the most illuminating and memorable portrayals of the American past.",

As the stories unfold, the reader is immersed in the evolution of the English language over the centuries, the theories of Noam Chomsky and his critics, the simulation of neural networks on computers, the illuminating errors of children as they begin to speak, the tragic loss of language from neurological disease, and more illustrations using humorous wordplay than anyone would have thought possible. Pinker makes sense of all these phenomena with the help of a single powerful idea: that the essence of language is a mental dictionary of memorized words and a mental grammar of creative rules.Pinker is well known for his skills of explaining the art and science of language. His bestselling book How the Mind Works was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and was the #1 bestselling book for amazon.com in 1997. His other bestseller The Language Instinct was named one of the Ten Best Books of 1994 by The New York Times Book Review and nominated for the William James Book Award by the American Psychological Association.",

        "Authors": "By Ansay, A. Manette",
        "Description": "From childhood, acclaimed novelist A. Manette Ansay trained to become a concert pianist. But when she was nineteen, a mysterious muscle disorder forced her to give up the piano, and by twenty-one, she couldn't grip a pen or walk across a room. She entered a world of limbo, one in which no one could explain what was happening to her or predict what the future would hold. At twenty-three, beginning a whole new life in a motorized wheelchair, Ansay made a New Year's resolution to start writing fiction, rediscovering the sense of passion and purpose she thought she had lost for good. Thirteen years later, still without a firm diagnosis or prognosis, Ansay reflects on the ways in which the unraveling of one life can plant the seeds of another, and considers how her own physical limbo has challenged\u2014in ways not necessarily bad\u2014her most fundamental assumptions about life and faith.Luminously written, Limbo is a brilliant and moving testimony to the resilience of the human spirit.",

        "Authors": "By Kidder, Tracy",
        "Description": "In this splendid book, one of America's masters of nonfiction takes us home--into Hometown, U.S.A., the town of Northampton, Massachusetts, and into the extraordinary, and the ordinary, lives that people live there. As Tracy Kidder reveals how, beneath its amiable surface, a small town is a place of startling complexity, he also explores what it takes to make a modern small city a success story. Weaving together compelling stories of individual lives, delving into a rich and varied past, moving among all the levels of Northampton's social hierarchy, Kidder reveals the sheer abundance of life contained within a town's narrow boundaries. Does the kind of small town that many Americans came from, and long for, still exist?\u00a0\u00a0Kidder says yes, although not quite in the form we may imagine. A book about civilization in microcosm, Home Town makes us marvel afresh at the wonder of individuality, creativity, and civic order--how a disparate group of individuals can find common cause and a code of values that transforms a place into a home. And this book makes you feel you live there.",

        "Title": "Good Health For African Americans",
        "Authors": "By Wilson, Josleen and Dixon, Barbara M.",
        "Description": "Good Health for African Americans is the first and only book dedicated to improving the health of all black Americans, written by a nationally recognized nutritionist and dynamic health educator. It defines all the complex issues that account for the enormous health gap between black and white Americans at every income level, along with a self-help program for improving health. The most current information, guidelines, and solutions to personal health problems appear nowhere else.There is a crisis in black health. African Americans live six years less than the national average and that difference is increasing. In her daily work, Barbara Dixon sees the excessive toll that diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, addictions, stress, and other major disorders take on the lives of black Americans. This disproportionate health statistic is tied to both past and present causes. Historical research traces modern health problems to the moment when the first African was captured for the slave trade. Slavery, emancipation, and modern life are all in the background of today's health picture.Dixon's message is clear and simple: By adopting a special diet as well as lifestyle changes, black Americans can begin to increase their chances for a long and robust life. Sankofa - an expression found among many West African languages, meaning \"learning from the past and building for the future\" - is a program that combines the healthful aspects of African-American life with the benefits of appropriate nutrition (including soul-food makeovers!), vitamins, proper exercise, and sound advice on how to relinquish risky behaviors.The goal of this truly pioneer book is to identify where history, stress, eating habits, poor medical care, rage, and racism all meet and begin to reverse their effects. All African Americans face heightened health risks, but no group has more to gain by taking charge of its own future good health.",

        "Description": "Mattie Ryder is a marvelously funny, well-intentioned, religious, sarcastic, tender, angry, and broke recently divorced mother of two young children. Then she finds a small rubber blue shoe-the kind you might get from a gumball machine-and a few other trifles that were left years ago in her deceased father's car. They seem to hold the secrets to her messy upbringing, and as she and her brother follow these clues to uncover the mystery of their past, she begins to open her heart to her difficult, brittle mother and the father she thought she knew. And with that acceptance comes an opening up to the possibilities of romantic love.  In a disarming blend of everyday life and the sublime, of reverence and irreverence, and of humor and grace, Anne Lamott speaks directly to our most closely held concerns, bringing comfort to anyone -all of us-whose family life can feel overwhelming and uncontainable.  Lamott's formidable storytelling gifts have gained her a large and passionate following, and anybody who has experienced the delightful humor and the canny understanding of her previous work will be similarly charmed by Blue Shoe.",
