She's even made glittery purple invitations for every girl in her class. Then a new girl, Alexis, joins their class. Alexis seems perfect: She's smart, pretty, and rules the soccer games on the playground. But no matter how hard Megan tries to be a friend to Alexis, the new girl is aloof or rude. At first, Megan thinks Alexis is shy. Then Megan starts to fear that Alexis is treating her differently because she's deaf. When the girls are forced to collaborate on a science fair project, Megan learns the truth -- and realizes that nobody's perfect.   Once again Marlee Matlin draws on experiences from her own childhood to tell Megan's story. In this funny, poignant book, readers will root for Megan, a spirited young girl who doesn't let anything stand in her way.",

        "Description": "What draws\u2014and binds\u2014thoughtful, educated people to a Church so often criticized by outsiders (and even members) as \"authoritarian\" or \"out of step with the times?\" This collection of personal accounts answers that question in diverse, fascinating, and deeply moving ways. Novelist William Kienzle discusses his years in the seminary, explaining why he eventually left the priesthood\u2014but not the Church.  Kathleen Howley reveals how God replaced alcohol in her life, and why the traditional Latin Mass holds so much more appeal than the folk Masses of her youth. Former baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn compares his feelings for the Church with his lifelong belief in \"team loyalty.\" Jon Hassler vividly recalls two very different childhood friends\u2014and the attractions of both evil and goodness. These writers, and numerous others, offer a remarkable portrait of today's Catholic Church, creating a new understanding of how its presence has endured for nearly two thousand years, and why it continues to thrive.",

Mountains and deserts, waterfalls and beaches -- each of our states has special things to see and enjoy. And all over this country, our flag flies, with fifty stars for our current fifty states and thirteen broad stripes for our original thirteen colonies.  A few years ago, Louise Borden spoke to a group of schoolchildren in a library in Birmingham, England. When she finished, the very first question was, \"What's it like to live in America?\" This book is her answer. Readers of all ages will join in this salute to the place we call home, celebrated here in a simple, inspiring text and in lovely, atmospheric, full-color pictures.",

She is a proud woman - and not a little ambitious. But she is also a caring mother and daughter who finds herself in the middle of a love affair and an investigation that will test her faith at every level.The novel opens with an inferno of unprecedented violence and baffling origin that devours a small Manhattan building and the fifty people unfortunate enough to be inside. Georgia suspects the fire may have been started by something the city has never seen before: a kitchen-sink concoction with the thermal power of rocket fuel. Though rare over the last decade, these fires are so ferocious they can melt a building's steel framework in minutes.Georgia is determined to uncover the truth, but as a rookie and a woman, she is repeatedly sidelined by powerful insiders who both fear and ridicule her efforts. She soon unearths more startling information connecting the blaze to three others that have gone unsolved - and to several eerie letters from someone calling himself \"The Fourth Angel.\" But before she can begin to sort through the evidence, she is torn apart by the bizarre behavior of her partner and by the seeming betrayal of another marshal, a man she has begun to trust with her heart. As Georgia gropes for answers, personally and professionally, the Fourth Angel tightens his grip on his real quarry, and plots an even more catastrophic and fiery finale.",

From the controversial origins of the Second World War to the course of each campaign, Dr. John Ray's narrative incorporates all the revelations of recent years. Ever since the secret of 'Enigma' was revealed, the history of many battles and campaigns has had to be rewritten. The opening of Russian archives has led to major changes in our understanding of the greatest land battles in history.Concise, fast-moving and utterly compelling, this new account of the Second World War is both comprehensive and easy to follow. Dr. John Ray investigates the social, political and military background to the war and the strengths and weaknesses of the Axis and Allied armed forces. He traces the course of the conflict across all campaigns from Poland in 1939 to Manchuria in 1945. He examines the role of key military and political leaders and never loses sight of the sometimes enormous gulf between how battles were planned and what actually happened on the ground.",

        "Description": "When beloved author Henri Nouwen set out to record this daybook of totally new reflections, he suddenly found himself on \"a true spiritual adventure.\" For in these 366 original, interlocking morsels of daily wisdom, Nouwen provides both sustenance and a trail for us to follow, as he unveils, to his own surprise, his personal map of faith. From the delicate interplay of human experience to the surrender to Christ and the embrace of Christian community, that journey of Christian spirituality is explored and celebrated here in each eloquent, thought\u2013provoking passage, \"The table is one of the most intimate places in our lives. It is there that we give ourselves to one another. When we say, 'Take some more, let me serve you another plate, let me pour you another glass, don't be shy, enjoy it,' we say a lot more than our words express. We invite our friends to become part of our lives. We want them to be nurtured by the same food and drink that nurture us. We desire communion.... Every breakfast, lunch, or dinner can become a time of growing communion with one another.\" Intimately personal and inspiring, Bread for the Journey is a daily feast of fresh insight into the challenges and deep joys of a life lived in close communion with God. Nouwen is a wise, loving companion who invites us along as he finds joy in the community of loss, true freedom in forgiveness of others, and hope in surprising places. Each daily meditation is a stepping\u2013stone along a path of private discovery, offering Nouwen's seasoned yet fresh ideas on kindness, love, suffering, and prayer, the Church as God's people, and the importance of Jesus in one's life\u2013reflecting, as a whole, Nouwen's own 'personal creed.' Bread for the Journey brims with daily nourishment and guidance for devoted followers and new friends alike \u2013\u2013 food for thought on a yearlong journey of discovery and faith.",

Yet sometimes \u2026in the busyness of our days or the duties of our jobs or the familiar habits of our worship or the everyday routine of our homes, the longing becomes complacency, and we sleep through opportunities to be with Him.Anne knows from personal experience that it\u2019s then, as we\u2019re drifting in comfortable complacency, that we most need a wake-up call\u2014a jolt that pushes us to seek out a revival of our passion for Jesus that began as a blazing fire but somehow has died down to an ineffective glow.The revival we need now is not a tent meeting or a series of church services designed to save the lost. It\u2019s something completely different: authentic, personal revival.In I Saw the Lord, Anne shares the revival lessons she has carried to audiences throughout the world, showing you how you can experience an authentic, deeper, richer relationship with God in a life-changing, fire-blazing revival.It begins here. Now. Open this book and hear the wake-up call. Then get ready for the fire of revival to fall \u2026 on you!",

        "Description": "Back after a four\u2013year hiatus, New York Times bestselling author Scott Adams presents an outrageous look at work, home and everyday life in his new book, Dilbert and the Way of the Weasel.  Building on Dilbert's theory that 'All people are idiots', Adams now says, 'All people are idiots. And they are also weasels.' Just ask anyone who worked at Enron. In this book, Adams takes a look into the Weasel Zone, the giant grey area between good moral behaviour and outright felonious activities. In the Weasel Zone, where most people reside, everything is misleading, but not exactly a lie. Building on his popular comic strip, Adams looks into work, home and everyday life and exposes the way of the weasel for everyone to see. With appearances from all the regular comic strip characters, Adams and Dilbert are at the top of their game \u2013 master satirists who expose the truth while making us laugh our heads off.",

        "Title": "The Social Life of Information",
        "Authors": "By Brown, John Seely and Duguid, Paul",
        "Description": "To see the future we can build with information technology, we must look beyond mere information to the social context that creates and gives meaning to it. For years, pundits have predicted that information technology will obliterate the need for almost everything&#151;from travel to supermarkets to business organizations to social life itself. Individual users, however, tend to be more sceptical. Beaten down by info-glut and exasperated by computer systems fraught with software crashes, viruses, and unintelligible error messages, they find it hard to get a fix on the true potential of the digital revolution. John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid help us to see through frenzied visions of the future to the real forces for change in society. They argue that the gap between digerati hype and end-user gloom is largely due to the 'tunnel vision' that information-driven technologies breed. We've become so focused on where we think we ought to be&#151;a place where technology empowers individuals and obliterates social organizations&#151;that we often fail to see where we're really going and what's helping us get there. We need, they argue, to look beyond our obsession with information and individuals to include the critical social networks of which these are always a part. Drawing from rich learning experiences at Xerox PARC, from examples such as IBM, Chiat/Day Advertising, and California's 'Virtual University', and from historical, social, and cultural research, the authors sharply challenge the futurists' sweeping predictions.They explain how many of the tools, jobs, and organizations seemingly targeted for future extinction in fact provide useful social resources that people will fight to keep. Rather than aiming technological bullets at these 'relics', we should instead look for ways that the new world of bits can learn from and complement them. Arguing elegantly for the important role that human sociability plays, even&#151;perhaps especially&#151;in the world of bits, The Social Life of Information gives us an optimistic look beyond the simplicities of information and individuals. It shows how a better understanding of the contribution that communities, organizations, and institutions make to learning, working and innovating can lead to the richest possible use of technology in our work and everyday lives.",
