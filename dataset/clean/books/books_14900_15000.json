But in this powerful, explosive, utterly  unforgettable new thriller, that all-out war has come twice for John  Fortunato.  Once for his country--and now to save his hometown and the woman he loves.Twenty-five years ago John Fortunato was a soldier in Vietnam, fighting in  the crushing darkness of the tunnels of Cu Chi, from which the Vietcong  launched their deadliest operations.  When he got back to his hometown of Elk  River, Illinois, he secretly re-created those hellish tunnels.  Partly a memorial, partly a kind of exorcism, they now lie hidden  beneath the town's  peaceful streets.  John traded his M-16 rifle for a Nikon camera and built a  career as a successful photographer.  He thought he had put the war and the  bloodshed behind him, but a powerful new enemy has other plans for John Fortunato.On a quiet April night, Fortunato witnesses the brutal sidewalk shooting of  an innocent man.  The vicious crime is but the first assault in a struggle  that will erupt into a full-scale battle for control of Elk River, a struggle  that will divide neighbors and tear families apart.On one side is a tough, beautiful labor lawyer; on the other is a man who  will stop at nothing to control the entire town.  And on the front line is  John Fortunato, whose secret tunnels will provide the battleground for his  own war, a war that revives the killing grounds of Cu Chi in a way he could  never have imagined.  But as everyone is about to learn, when this veteran warrior goes down, he's just begun to fight.From the terrible intimacy of tunnel combat below the steaming jungles of  Vietnam, to the brutal battles on the streets of the American heartland, to  the unyielding courage of a man and woman prepared to sacrifice everything to  make a dream come true, Digger is a harrowing, powerfully written novel that breaks all the rules.",

        "Title": "Ansel Adams: Miniature Art Book",
        "Authors": "By Adams, Ansel",
        "Description": "Ansel Adams is best known for a series of photographs he produced of America's natural heritage known collectively as the National Park Service Photographs, representative examples of which are reproduced here.  This assignment was especially commissioned in 1941 by Harold Ickes of the United States Department of the Interior and the aim was to record for posterity areas that had been designated national parks, as well as portraying the Native American homelands and other monuments and areas of reclamation of the great American wilderness.  These would also be used as photo-murals to decorate the walls of the Department of the Interior.  Ickes was already familiar with Ansel's work having seen detailed studies of leaves and ferns which featured in an exhibition of 1936.  Indeed, he liked them so much that he hung one in his own office.  He eventually made Ansel's acquaintance when the photographer came to lobby Congress, seeking to have Kings River Canyon, California designated a national park.  Originally, only painted murals by established artists were thought suitable for inclusion in the Mural Project, as it came to be known, as photography had yet to be considered worthy of being regarded as an art form, rather than a way of recording or documenting reality; but Ickes was convinced that Ansel's work was artistically valid and would make its own inimitable contribution to the scheme.The collection of works commissioned in 1941 was intermixed with earlier studies of the Kings Canyon area dating back to 1936, and these and the new prints were offered as part of the commission.  The photographs are a pictorial testament to the majesty of the American West, captured with technical accuracy and imbued with sheer inventiveness and a deep empathy for the regions which Ansel sought to protect and maintain intact. They range from rivers and canyons, close-ups of plant life, Native American villages and their inhabitants, the mysterious and enigmatic underworld of the Carlsbad Caverns and the geysers and twisted forms of Yellowstone National Park.  Together, they offer a visual feast and a source of delight and nourishment for the spirit.",

        "Title": "BODY COUNT: Moral Poverty...And How to Win America's War Against Crime and Drugs",
        "Authors": "By Bennett, William J., Diiulio, John J., and Walters, John P.",
        "Description": "Body Count diagnoses America's plague of violent crime. Its authors - William Bennett, John DiIulio, and John Walters - define the epidemic's size, its range, and its scope. Through stories and anecdotes they present the very real human tragedies behind the numbers. Most important, they describe the source of violent crime: abject moral poverty, the destitution visited upon children raised without loving, capable, responsible adults who teach right from wrong. Though dozens of other explanations have been offered for America's horrifying rates of violent crime - from academics and clinicians, cops and social workers, politicians on the right and the left - they are, at best, proxies for the real cause. It is not prisons (or their scarcity), guns (or their excess), the death penalty, the exclusionary rule, or even material impoverishment. Look to the root of a criminally twisted tree, the authors argue, and you will find only moral poverty and its parasite: drug abuse.And argue they do, with both powerful rhetoric and rigorous analysis. Bennett, DiIulio, and Walters demolish such myths as economic poverty causes crime; the United States imprisons a disproportionate number of its citizens; drug abuse is a victimless crime...and nothing useful can be done about it anyway; the death penalty is today a major deterrent of crime; and incarceration doesn't work.Each and every one of these myths is not merely wrong but tragically mistaken. The authors draw upon an immense fund of hard data and offer some of the most serious analysis ever given to America's criminal justice system - a system designed to protect America from violent crime, a system that has, for all practical purposes, failed, with one in three violent crimes committed by a person on either probation, parole, or pre-trial release. Body Count offers a radically new reading of the problem, proposes controversial but necessary policies at every level of government, profiles cities that are making progress against violent crime, and appeals to responsible citizens from all points on the political compass to join forces in the battle against moral poverty. It is certain to be one of the most read, discussed, and argued about books of the year.",

        "Description": "Here, from the author of such monumental bestsellers as Kane and Abel and As the Crow flies, is an ingeniously plotted thriller that is as up-to-the-minute as today's headlines.In Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1993, it is the dawn of a new political era - but six thousand miles away in the impoverished streets of Baghdad, there is a growing disillusionment with the unelected president. Sensing the mood of the people, Saddam Hussein moves boldly to settle scores with the United States.Using $100 million as bait, Saddam gathers into his web three key players: a powerful American Mafia boss; the world's greatest forger; and, most crucially a special assistant to the President of the United States, Bill Clinton.Saddam's goal is to embarrass the U.S. by stealing part of its history - then destroying that symbol in front of the world's media. With the help of a sophisticated criminal underworld that exhibits Swiss-watch timing, and a skilled actor who is transformed through plastic surgery into a stand-in for Bill Clinton, he sets about his brilliant scheme.As the countdown begins to July 1993 - potentially the most humiliating day in U.S. history - two lovers, a beautiful Mossad agent and a dashing American professor who advises the CIA, turn out to be a far more formidable weapon than any Patriot missile.In what is sure to be hailed as the suspense novel of the year, master storyteller Jeffrey Archer reminds us that the things worth dying for are sometimes to be found in the words that define our historic values.",

When these two vital, lonely people see each other across a crowded lobby at a small business owners' seminar, an intense attraction blooms that neither tries to squelch. They're not sure what fate has in store for them, but they're not about to let something as silly as a generations-long feud stand in the way of finding out. That is, not until Romeo's octogenarian mother, Julie's meddling ex-husband, and a cast of grown Cacciamani and Roseman children begin to intervene with a passionate hatred that matches their newly found love, stroke for stroke.

Capozzi has collected five hundred priceless axioms that will amuse and instruct anyone in business - whether corporate CEO, independent entrepreneur, rising corporate executive, or college student with major ambitions. Here are maxims drawn from solid common sense (\"Know how to use a computer\"), philosophical musings (\"Success is a journey, not a destination\"), and business acumen (\"Even if your entire board of directors votes for a dumb idea, it is still a dumb idea\").These aphorisms are based on principles that helped Capozzi earn thirteen corporate promotions in as many years, then go on to make millions in his own ventures. Throughout the book, Capozzi elaborates with anecdotes that illustrate such varied points as why you should never let personal setbacks distract you, how reading the newspaper can result in surprising opportunities, and why you should always carry a yellow pad, \"the ultimate corporate fashion accessory, and much more.\"The result is an uncommon collection of friendly advice and well-learned lessons, an essential handbook for those on their way to the top and those who want to stay there.",

The good news is that popular new prescription drugs like  Prozac and Xanax bring much needed relief. The bad news is that many physicians and therapists are unaware of common issues for women. As medical treatment for depression and anxiety has become simpler, more and more general practitioners are prescribing antidepressants, often with little background in the nonmedical alternatives or complex mind-body interactions.Emphasizing women's family roles as well as their unique biological/hormonal sensitivities, Dr. Raskin explains contemporary integrated treatment options. Raskin pays special attention to how birth control, menstrual cycles, childbearing, and menopause impact treatment choices. Raskin empowers women to take an active approach in dealing with common side effects, including weight gain and diminished sexual responsiveness. Using revealing case studies, Raskin offers a wealth of hands-on advice.At a time when trends in health care have led to less personalized contact between doctor and patient, When Words Are Not Enough provides the facts and reassurance women need to be in control of their own health.",

        "Title": "Making the Cisco Connection: The Story Behind the Real Internet Superpower",
        "Authors": "By Brandt, Richard, Bunnell, David, and Brate, Adam",
        "Description": "Cisco Systems is known among the technology elite in Silicon Valley as one of the most successful companies to emerge from the Valley in many years. It has been dubbed computing's next Superpower.Just as Intel and Microsoft soared to lofty heights with the rise of the personal computer, Cisco Systems is flying on the spectacular updraft of the Internet. The company, which makes specialized computers that route information through a network--acting as a sort of data traffic cop--has captured 85 percent of the market for routers used as the backbone of the biggest network of them all, the Internet. As a result, over the last five years, the value of Cisco's total outstanding stock has risen over 2,000 percent--twice the increase of Microsoft Corp. stock in the same period. Beginning as a tale of two college sweethearts at Stanford University who cofounded the company fifteen years ago, the often-told Cisco legend has all the makings of a great novel--love, money, a villain or two, corporate coups, and the sweet taste of victory. But mostly, the Cisco story is a very unusual tale of corporate success. Despite the struggle of passing through several regimes, Cisco managed to hit all the crucial spots of its business. Cisco consistently bested competitors like 3Com and IBM with insight, innovation, customer focus, and one of the biggest corporate buying sprees in history. Making the Cisco Connection deftly traces the networking giant's path to success, from its founding couple, Sandra Lerner and Leonard Bosack, to current CEO John Chambers. It highlights the company's astounding knack for buying other businesses and making them part of a huge conglomerate; its own highly developed use of technology; and its unusually tight-knit culture. Featuring the perspective of top Cisco executives and competitors, this book reveals how Cisco's technology, employees, and even its competition have blended to make Cisco possibly the most important company shaping the future of communications. Next to ruthless competitors Microsoft and Intel, Cisco shines with a kinder, gentler image, emphasizing happy customers and employees. You'll see how Cisco built its impressive culture by cultivating community, boosting morale, whittling down bureaucracy, and saving money to boot. This book also explains how Cisco is positioning itself to enter a new competitive playing field, moving beyond Internet routers in an attempt to build a single, giant, global communications system--based on the Internet--that would make the current telephone system obsolete. Cisco wants to be the company that delivers the infrastructure of this new network, which will combine computer networks with telephones, television, radio, and satellite communications. To do that, it is now challenging global giants such as Lucent Technologies and Fujitsu. Cisco plans to become the backbone of the entire communications industry, making it a corporation of incredible power as the Internet Age blossoms in the new millennium.Provocative and instructive, Making the Cisco Connection traces the unique history of one of the most profitable and enduring technology companies in business today.Acclaim for Making the CISCO Connection\"If you want to learn the whole scoop about the first Internet-Age company, and one of the most successful firms of any age, you've come to the right place. Bunnell's treatment of Cisco's rise--and continued rise--is fascinating and full of human detail. It's clear that Cisco is not just a firm with great technology, but also great leaders and managers.\"--Thomas H. Davenport, Director, Andersen Consulting Institute for Strategic Change; Professor, Boston University School of Management\"Cisco has emerged as a twenty-first century leader. David Bunnell captures the ongoing story of the Cisco executive team exploiting IT, structuring a unique organization, and creating a dynamic strategy for this breakaway dot com company",

Higgins wrote \u201cCharles McCarry is the Lord's best combination of spellbinding storyteller and silken prose writer.\u201d \u201cIntelligent and enthralling,\u201d said Eric Ambler, and Jeffrey Archer praised writing that \u201cmakes one put the book down and gasp.\u201d In his magnificent new novel, with rights sold in six countries before publication, McCarry returns to the world of his legendary character, Paul Christopher, the crack intelligence agent who is as skilled at choosing a fine wine as he is at tradecraft, at once elegant and dangerous, sophisticated and rough-and-ready. As the novel begins, Paul Christopher, now an aging but remarkably fit 70ish, is dining at home with his cousin Horace, also an ex-agent. Dinner is delicious and uneventful. A day later, Paul has vanished. The months pass, Paul\u2019s ashes are delivered by a Chinese official to the American consulate in Beijing and a memorial service is held in Washington. But Horace is not convinced that Paul is dead and, enlisting the support of four other retired colleagues\u2014a sort of all-star backfield of the old Outfit\u2014Horace gets the \u201cOld Boys\u201d back in the game to find Paul Christopher. Harassed by American intelligence, hunted by terrorists, Horace Christopher and the Old Boys travel the globe, from Xinjiang to Brazil, from Rome to Tel Aviv, Budapest to Moscow, in search of Paul and the unspeakably dangerous truth.",

Additionally, specific minority groups are given individual treatment to contrast similarities and differences.

He also writes engagingly about personal incidents and meetings with public figures.Herbert Block has been using the pen name \"Herblock\" since the age of thirteen, when he started contributing quips and comments to a humor column in the Chicago Tribune and apprenticed himself to the columnist. He dropped out of college to take his first cartooning job with the Chicago Daily News at age 19.In 1946, after a wartime stint in the Army, he moved to The Washington Post - then a comparatively small paper.He is the only cartoonist to win the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award for contributions to the cause of freedom of speech and the press, the National Press Club Fourth Estate Award and the Franklin Roosevelt Freedom Medal.

        "Description": "This compact history of the war attempts to separate myth from reality. Professor Coles narrates the main operations on both land and sea of the three-year struggle. He examines the conflict from the British (and Canadian) as well as the American point of view, relating events in America to the larger war going on in Europe. \"A balanced analysis of tactics and strategy, this book also summarizes succinctly and clearly recent scholarship on causes and describes briefly the war's military, economic, and political consequences. Coles has surveyed thoroughly the existing literature but arrives at a number of independent judgments. It is the best single-volume account of the war in all its aspects. In recounting sea battles, Coles puts aside the patriotic blinders that have for so long prevented a sensible understanding of American capabilities and strategic necessities; thus American naval victories are put in a proper perspective. And in dealing with land engagements, he has shunned the mocking and amused attitude which has so often passed for historical judgment. Undergraduates will be stimulated by the hints of modern parallels and will find useful the excellent annotated bibliography and simple maps.\"\u2014Choice",

        "Description": "In her absorbing bestseller, The Hidden Life of Dogs, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas provided fascinating answers to the question \"What do dogs want?\" It turns out that more than anything, they want the company of other dogs. Now, in this frank and moving sequel, she explores how, despite this desire, they have beautifully adapted to life with their human owners. If they can't belong to a group with similar dogs, they will establish or join one with other members of the household, whether those members are men, women, children, other dogs of different ages and breeds, cats, or birds. And, contrary to our assumptions that we wield the power in our relationships with our dogs, it is they who are teaching us new behaviors -- even settling disputes in ways we are unaware of.  No one writing today about dogs and people has Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's skills as a classically trained anthropologist and popularizer. What she has observed and analyzed will be illuminating to all of us who have wondered about our pets' behavior. Do dogs have different barks that mean different things? How does Snoopy recognize as family people he sees only once a year? And why does Misty bark at strangers she sees every day? What factors contribute to making a dog difficult to house-train? Why do certain dogs and cats get along so well? How do animals train each other?  Thomas explores these questions by taking us into the mixed-species groups of her own household, particularly the lives of her remarkable dogs, with their differences in breeding, early training, and personality. Misty, a purebred, had been kept in a crate, alone, for most of her first year; lonely and insecure, she was afraid of grass and stairs, which she had never seen. Ruby was abandoned, having been pronounced untrainable. Pearl had lived with Thomas's son in his large household, and on her arrival at Thomas's house, she behaved like the well-mannered, self-possessed being she was. And Sundog, the most loyal, self-confident, courageous of all, accepted the arrival of each of these new dogs, but had made a group consisting of himself and Thomas's husband, so the others sorted themselves out without him. Each of these dogs, like any other, wanted more than anything to belong to a group, and how they organized themselves into felicitous relationships without any input from their owners is the most compelling of Elizabeth Thomas's many findings.  Few dogs get to live with their chosen loved ones; they are slaves to our desires. We convince ourselves, however wrongly, that we know what's best for them. The Social Lives of Dogs presents marvelous evidence of the power of the group. And those of us fortunate enough to be given the trust of any honorable dog will have our lives enlarged.

Valleys are nothing new for any of us. Some of you may be in a valley right now, or, since you never know what\u2019s around the corner, you may be on the brink of tottering into yet another valley. Or maybe you\u2019ve just survived a valley that you swear you\u2019ll never revisit\u2014but guess what? That\u2019s precisely the valley you\u2019ll probably see again. And again.  Being in a valley can be a lonely and bewildering experience. This book was written to help you feel less lonely by reminding you that you really aren\u2019t ever alone since God is always by your side, but more important, you are always by your own side. No matter how dire the situation may seem, no matter how dark and bleak the valley may be, you have all you need within you to survive the valley\u2014any valley. Even though you may not know how you got into the valley in the first place, you do know, deep inside yourself, how to get through and out and free. You just need a little faith in yourself and a little guidance to find that faith within yourself.  When you are at your wit\u2019s end, take this little book and let it guide you toward the ever-present but often elusive light at the end of the tunnel. Faith in the Valley is designed to help you find the light when you need it most\u2014when you\u2019re in that damn tunnel. When you\u2019re most confused and in the dark and clueless as to how you got there (again!) and when you\u2019re trying to figure out not just how to get out, but stay out. For good.  Faith in the Valley has helped so many through so much that we felt it only fitting to issue this lovely gift edition to acknowledge the special place it holds in many hearts. Please share it with a friend who has served as your beacon in the past, or offer it to yourself as a reminder of the strength and wisdom you possess and can offer to others.  Iyanla",

        "Description": "At last, a biography absorbing enough to do justice to one of the most controversial American intellectuals of this century. Beautiful, reckless, and endlessly maddening, Mary McCarthy (1912-1989) never failed to leave an impression. From her Partisan Review days as the embattled \"dark lady of American letters\" to her stormy marriage to (and even stormier divorce from) critic Edmund Wilson, from her huge but controversial success with her best-selling novel The Group to her epic libel battle with Lillian Hellman, she brought an almost nineteenth-century scope and drama to her emblematic twentieth-century life. Time called her \"quite possibly the cleverest woman America has ever produced,\" and she moved in a circle of the most intellectually combative and sharpest tongued Americans of this century--all of whom had plenty to say (some of it complimentary, some distinctly not) about this vibrant woman in their midst. Frances Kiernan has interviewed dozens of McCarthy's good friends, former lovers, literary and political comrades-in-arms, awestruck admirers, amused observers, and bitter adversaries to produce a definitive biography rich in delicious gossip, ironic judgment, and eloquent testimony.",
