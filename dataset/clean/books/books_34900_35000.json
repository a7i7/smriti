        "Authors": "By Fagan, Brian M.",
        "Description": "What gave Christopher Columbus the confidence in 1492 to set out across the Atlantic Ocean? What persuaded the king and queen of Spain to commission the voyage? It would be convenient to believe that Columbus and his men were uniquely courageous. A more reasonable explanation, however, is that Columbus was heir to a body of knowledge about seas and ships acquired at great cost over many centuries. Fish on Friday tells a new story of the discovery of America. In Brian Fagan's view, that discovery is the product of the long sweep of history: the spread of Christianity and the radical cultural changes it brought to Europe, the interaction of economic necessity with a changing climate, and generations of unknown fishermen who explored the North Atlantic in the centuries before Columbus. The Church's tradition of not eating meats on holy days created a vast market for fish that could not be fully satisfied by fish farms, better boats, or new preservation techniques. Then, when climate change in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries diminished fish stocks off Norway and Iceland, fishermen were forced to range ever farther to the west-eventually discovering incredibly rich shoals within sight of the Nova Scotia coast. In Ireland in 1490, Columbus could well have heard about this unknown land. The rest is history.",

Saks & Violins.Hard times and sour notes have hit the cousins in both the B&B and the graphic design business. To make matters worse, Renie's up to her latest eyebrow wax in debt, due to overzealous spending on clothes on their recent trip to San Francisco. And in the house that Herself - Judith's nemesis and hubby Joe's ex-wife - has rented out, there dwells a symphony violinist whose practice of outdoor practicing au naturel is driving the neighbors out of the cozy cul-de-sac and into soundproof rooms. In fact, they swear they'd like to kill the nude, rude Rudi.No such luck. The only buffer zone from the in-the-buff violinist is the Rankerses' hedge. Instead of Rudi taking a final bow with his damnable bow, it's his larger-than-life mentor, Dolph Kluger, who meets death, not by getting entangled in the lethal laurel, but from ingesting ruthless rhubarb.To add to the musical mess, Rudi's valuable violin bow goes missing, Renie's useless credit cards are stolen, a headless horseman rides through somebody's past, and several suspects seem to be on the brink of bonkersville. Judith has to be extra careful with these lyrical loonies or somebody will be playing her funeral march before the killer bows out.",

Built over an unquiet grave, the House of the Seven Gables carries a dying man's curse that blights the lives of its residents for over two centuries. Now Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, an iron-hearted hypocrite and intellectual heir to the mansion's unscrupulous founder, is attempting to railroad a pair of his elderly relatives out of the house. Only two young people stand in his way \u2014 a visiting country cousin and an enigmatic boarder skilled in mesmerism.Hawthorne envisioned this family drama of evil, revenge, and resolution as a microcosm of Salem's own history as in idealistic society corrupted by greed and pride. His enduring view of the darkness at the heart of the national soul has made The House of the Seven Gables a landmark of American literature.",

        "Description": "In 1987, Dr. Benjamin Carson gained worldwide recognition for his part in the first successful separation of Siamese twins joined at the back of the head. The extremely complex and delicate operation, five months in the planning and twenty-two hours in the execution, involved a surgical plan that Carson helped initiate. Carson pioneered again in a rare procedure known as hemispherectomy, giving children without hope a second chance at life through a daring operation in which he literally removed one half of their brain. But such breakthroughs aren\u2019t unusual for Ben Carson. He\u2019s been beating the odds since he was a child. Raised in inner-city Detroit by a mother with a third grade education, Ben lacked motivation. He had terrible grades. And a pathological temper threatened to put him in jail. But Sonya Carson convinced her son that he could make something of his life, even though everything around him said otherwise. Trust in God, a relentless belief in his own capabilities, and sheer determination catapulted Ben from failing grades to the top of his class \u2014 and beyond to a Yale scholarship . . . the University of Michigan Medical School . . . and finally, at age 33, the directorship of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Today, Dr. Ben Carson holds twenty honorary doctorates and is the possessor of a long string of honors and awards, including the Horatio Alger Award, induction into the \"Great Blacks in Wax\" Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, and an invitation as Keynote Speaker at the 1997 President\u2019s National Prayer Breakfast. Gifted Hands is the riveting story of one man\u2019s secret for success, tested against daunting odds and driven by an incredible mindset that dares to take risks. This inspiring autobiography takes you into the operating room to witness surgeries that made headlines around the world \u2014 and into the private mind of a compassionate, God-fearing physician who lives to help others. Through it all shines a humility, quick wit, and down-to-earth style that make this book one you won\u2019t easily forget.",

        "Authors": "By Wallace, Daniel J. and Wallace, Janice Brock",
        "Description": "This year, six million Americans--most of them women--will go to their doctors, complaining of an illness they have no name for. The majority will be turned away or treated for depression; the few who persist will go to an average of four doctors before they receive the correct diagnosis: fibromyalgia.      In Making Sense of Fibromyalgia, noted medical writer Janice Wallace and Dr. Daniel Wallace, a leading expert on this disorder, provide a comprehensive guide--for both patients and professionals--to this little known and poorly understood syndrome. The authors offer detailed information in a clear and accessible style, taking readers through the steps of diagnosis, all the established forms of treatment, and alternative therapies that have yet to be proven effective. Fibromyalgia, they explain, is a pain amplification, brought on by abnormal interactions between hormones, the immune system, neurotransmitters, and the autonomic nervous system. Sometimes the syndrome occurs spontaneously; in most cases, the authors write, it is associated with trauma, stress, such conditions as lupus and hypothyroidism, and over forty microbes, from hepatitis to Epstein Barr to Lyme disease. They draw on actual cases to illustrate their points  and to break through the isolation that patients often feel when doctors misdiagnose or simply ignore their symptoms.      When Dr. Wallace wrote The Lupus Book, he brought hope and relief into the lives of countless Americans, in a book that sold through many printings. In Making Sense of Fibromyalgia, the authors address a desperate need for information and reassurance, in a groundbreaking book.",

        "Title": "Britons: Forging the Nation 1707-1837",
        "Authors": "By Colley, Linda",
        "Description": "In this splendidly wide-ranging and compelling book, Linda Colley recounts how a new British nation was invented in the wake of the Act of Union between England and Wales and Scotland in 1707. She describes how a succession of major wars with Catholic France - culminating in the epic conflict with Napoleon - served as both a threat and a tonic, forcing the diverse peoples of this deeply Protestant culture into closer union and reminding them of what they had in common. She shows how the world-wide empire, which was the prize of so much successful warfare, gave men and women from different ethnic and social backgrounds a powerful incentive to be British. In the process, she not only demonstrates how an overarching British identity came to be superimposed on to much older regional and national identities, but she also illumines why it is that these same older identities - be it Scottishness or Welshness or Englishness or regionalism of one kind or another - have re-emerged and become far more important in the late twentieth century.An integral part of Colley's story are the aspirations, ambitions and antics of individual Britons. She supplies masterly vignettes of well-known heroes and politicians like Horatio Nelson and William Pitt the Younger, of bourgeois patriots like Thomas Coram and John Wilkes, and of artists and writers who helped forge our image of Britishness - William Hogarth, Benjamin West, David Wilkie, J.M.W. Turner, Charlotte Bronte and Walter Scott. She draws on paintings, plays, cartoons, diaries, almanacs, sermons and songs to bring vividly to life an array of men and women who have previously been left out of the historical record, from the British army officers who staged a medieval tournament in Philadelphia to defy the American 'rebels', to the women who raised money for a nude statue of the duke of Wellington, to the hundreds of thousands of working men who volunteered to fight the French in 1803. Throughout, she analyses patriotism rather than assumes its existence, and shows it to have been a remarkably diverse and often rational phenomenon.Finely written and lavishly illustrated, this highly original and timely book is a major contribution to our understanding of Britain's past and to the contemporary debate about the shape and identity of Britain in the future.",

        "Description": "America is under siege.Henri Cazaux, one of the world's most feared and deadly terrorists, is conducting a campaign of vindication and revenge against the United States. Cazaux, who was abused by American soldiers during an incarceration when he was a teenager in Europe, has waited years for this opportunity. Now, when the United States seems at its most vulnerable, he decides to strike. His method is ingenious in its simplicity: using large commercial aircraft purchased from an airline graveyard wholesaler, Cazaux will deploy bombs out of a modified rear-entry stair on unsuspecting critical targets.Cazaux's first attack is on a small northern California airport, even as he is fleeing federal authorities who are hot on his trail. But in a stunning turn in the chase, Cazaux heads directly for San Francisco International Airport, where he unleashes an entire cargo of high-impact explosives. The destruction of life and property is enormous, and the panic that ensues reaches all the way to the White House. As the nation watches helplessly in horror, Cazaux launches a second attack, this one against a major overnight shipping company facility in Memphis; the country's express package-delivery systems are all but crippled.With airports held hostage to Cazaux's pathological whims, and the President's back against the wall, there is only one man who can end the chaos. He is Rear Admiral Ian Hardcastle, known to readers of the author's previous bestselling novel Hammerheads. And Hardcastle, along with Lieutenant Colonel Al \"Rattler\" Vincenti, is ordered to reestablish security in the skies before there is further political fallout in the White House and the nation. Hardcastle's response to the emergency must be drastic, and it is . . . until Cazaux hits the Dallas/Fort Worth airport, then aims his sights on the biggest target of all - the nation's capital.The deadly game of cat-and-mouse pitting Hardcastle and Vincenti against Cazaux escalates as Storming Heaven hurtles toward a breathtaking climax over the skies of Washington, D.C. There, through midair dogfights and a skirmish involving Air Force One, readers are nailed to their seats by Brown's sheer storytelling genius.Storming Heaven is Dale Brown's most brilliant novel yet of military suspense, filled with all the excitement his readers have come to expect. It is a virtuoso performance by the undisputed master of the genre.",

Hardy and Jason Clarke to take action into their own hands. In Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man, Hardy and Clarke dish it back hard to the fervent prophet of the far left, turning a careful eye on Moore's use of camera tricks and publicity ploys to present his own version of the truth.Postwar documentarians gave us the documentary, Rob Reiner gave us the mockumentary, and Moore initiated a third genre, the crockumentary.How, they ask, does Moore pull off a proletarian, \"man-of-the-people\" image so at odds with his lifestyle as a fabulously wealthy Manhattanite? And how large of an impact do his incendiary, ill-founded polemics have on the growing community that follows him with near-religious devotion? Loaded with well-researched, solidly reasoned arguments, and laced with irreverent wit, Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man fires back at one of the left's biggest targets\u2014politically and literally.",

When his father sets out on a cattle drive toward Kansas for the summer, fourteen-year-old Travis Coates is left to take care of his family and their farm. Living in Texas Hill Country during the 1860s, Travis comes to face new, unanticipated, and often perilous responsibilities in the frontier wilderness.A particular nuisance is a stray yellow dog that shows up one day and steals food from the family. But the big canine who Travis calls \u201cOld Yeller\u201d proves his worth by defending the family from danger. And Travis ultimately finds help and comfort in the courage and unwavering love of the dog who comes to be his very best friend. Fred Gipson\u2019s novel is an eloquently simple story that is both exciting and deeply moving. It stands alongside works like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Where The Red Fern Grows, and Shiloh as a beloved and enduring classic of literature. Originally published in 1956 to instant acclaim, Old Yeller later inspired a hit film from Walt Disney. Just as Old Yeller inevitably makes his way into the Coates family\u2019s hearts, this book will find its own special place in readers\u2019 hearts.",

        "Title": "American Dynasty",
        "Authors": "By Phillips, Kevin P.",
        "Description": "Despite their years in the political limelight, the Bushes are the family nobody really knows - so contends Kevin Phillips, onetime Republican strategist and one of the country's premier political and economic commentators. The cozy imagery of Maine summer cottages, a gray-haired national grandmother, and cowboy boots has emphasized comforting family values. It has also distracted us from the fact that the Bush family has used all its resources to create a political dynasty that has gained the White House to further its family and ideological agenda, which would have horrified America's founding fathers. They, after all, led a revolution against a succession of royal Georges.In this book, Phillips reveals how four generations of Bushes, beginning with the original alliance between George Herbert Walker and Samuel P. Bush, have ascended the ladder of national power since World War I, solidifying their place in the American establishment - at Yale, on Wall Street, in the Senate, the CIA, the vice presidency, and the White House. The Bush family has never produced a doctor, judge, teacher, scholar, or lawyer of note. As far back as World War I, the family's single-minded focus has been on three major areas: intelligence, energy, and national security. It is no coincidence that these three categories of Bush family operations were also three of the key enterprises of the American twentieth century.Phillips demonstrates how the Bush family has perfectly exemplified many of the growing trends in American political life - policy favoritism to the top 1 percent, paper entrepreneurialism, and crony capitalism a la Enron (the Bushes' dealings with Enron go back to 1986). Far more than any previous political family, it represents an interlock between the hitherto temporary presidency and permanent government. As such, the family has threaded its way through political and armaments scandals and, since the 1980s, faint hints of acts that might in another climate have led to presidential impeachment.",

Then the tide of World War II rolls onto the island's shores in the form of the conquering Italian army.Caught in the occupation are Pelagia, a willful, beautiful young woman, and the two suitors vying for her love: Mandras, a gentle fisherman turned ruthless guerilla, and the charming, mandolin-playing Captain Corelli, a reluctant officer of the Italian garrison on the island.
