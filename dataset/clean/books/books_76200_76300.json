        "Description": "Putting the terms \"sugar\" and \"health\" together seems almost like a paradox, but emerging evidence shows that certain types of sugars-commonly called saccharides or glyconutrients-are responsible for fighting off disease and maintaining overall health. In MIRACLE SUGARS, author Rita Elkins explains how eight essential sugars are at the core of our cells' ability to communicate and cooperate in the maintenance and balance of our bodies. The book outlines how these essential saccharides, which are found naturally in food and in available supplements, can fight infection, enhance immune function and battle an impressive variety of health disorders. These sugars have been shown to reverse autoimmune disorders and diabetes, ease allergy symptoms, lower risk of heart disease, and improve overall function of the body's immune processes. Infections respond well to use of saccharides, as do symptoms of fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and lupus. Even cancer patients have found glyconutrients to enhance traditional treatments while lessening their side effects. Glyconutrients can provide a world of benefits when it comes to your health.",

        "Authors": "By Bronson, Rachel",
        "Description": "For fifty-five years, the United States and Saudi Arabia were solid partners.  Then came the 9/11 attacks, which sorely tested that relationship.  In Thicker than Oil, Rachel Bronson reveals why the partnership became so intimate and how the countries' shared interests sowed the seeds of today's most pressing problem--Islamic radicalism.        Drawing on a wide range of archival material, declassified documents, and interviews with leading Saudi and American officials, Bronson chronicles a history of close, and always controversial, contacts.  She argues that contrary to popular belief the relationship was never simply about \"oil for security.\"   Saudi Arabia's geographic location and religiously motivated foreign policy figured prominently in American efforts to defeat \"godless communism.\"   From Africa to Afghanistan, Egypt to Nicaragua, the two worked to beat back Soviet expansion. But decisions made for hardheaded Cold War purposes left behind a legacy that today enflames the Middle East.  In this landmark work, Bronson exposes the political calculations that drove this secretive relationship.  Her lively narrative is interwoven with colorful stories of diplomatic adventures and misadventures--including details of high-level backchannel conversations, awkward cross-cultural encounters, and a bizarre American request for the Saudi government to subsidize Polish pork exports, a demand the U.S. Ambassador refused to deliver.  Looking forward, she outlines the challenges confronting the relationship. The Saudi government faces a zealous internal opposition bent on America's and Saudi Arabia's destruction. Yet from the perspective of both countries, the status quo is clearly unsustainable.  This book shows how this crucial relationship evolved, and suggests ways to chart its future course.",

In Home to Big Stone Gap, she tells her most powerful story yet, full of humor and heart, wisdom and hope.Nestled in the lush Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, the town of Big Stone Gap has been home for Ave Maria Mulligan Machesney and her family for generations. She\u2019s been married to her beloved Jack for nearly twenty years, raised one child and buried another, and run a business that binds her community together, all while holding her tight circle of family and friends close. But with her daughter, Etta, having flown the nest to enchanting Italy, Ave Maria has reached a turning point. When a friend\u2019s postcard arrives with the message \u201cIt\u2019s time to live your life for you,\u201d Ave Maria realizes that it\u2019s time to go in search of brand-new dreams. But before she can put her foot on the path, her life is turned upside down. Ave Maria agrees to helm the town musical, a hilarious reunion of local talent past and present. A lifelong friendship collapses when a mysterious stranger comes to town and reveals a long-buried secret. An unexpected health crisis threatens her family. An old heartthrob reappears, challenging her marriage and offering a way out of her troubles. An opportunistic coal company comes to town and threatens to undermine the town\u2019s way of life and the mountain landscape Ave Maria has treasured since she was a girl. Now she has no choice but to reinvent her world, her life, and herself, whether she wants to or not. Trigiani is at her best in this exquisite page-turner. Home to Big Stone Gap is an emotional and unforgettable journey that reminds us that you can go home again and again. From BOOKLIST*STAR* Trigiani, Adriana. Home to Big Stone Gap. Nov. 2006. 301p. Random, $25.95 (1-4000-6008-7). Tucked in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia is Big Stone Gap, the bucolic backdrop for Trigiani\u2019s popular series. In this fourth entry, Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney and her husband, Jack, must come to terms with the absence of daughter Etta, newly married and living in Italy. (The country holds a special place in Ave Maria\u2019s heart: her biological father, Mario, whom she learned of and met only after her mother\u2019s death, is Italian). Ave Maria has plenty to keep her mind off missing her only child (the MacChesney\u2019s son, Joe, died of leukemia at age four). She\u2019s a full-time pharmacist and the newly appointed director of the town\u2019s annual musical. Then comes news that her longtime friend, glamorous librarian Iva Lou, has been keeping a startling secret for nearly 20 years. Other developments, including a health scare for Jack and a Christmas visit from a colorful former resident, move the plot along briskly. With her original cast of characters, playwright and television writer Trigiani blends playfulness and pathos in this evocative portrait of a small southern town. Fans of the Big Stone Gap series can look forward to a feature film; Trigiani has written the screenplay and is slated to direct. \u2013Allison Block\"Is there ever trouble for Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney, heroine of Trigiani's beloved Big Stone Gap novels, starting with her married daughter's move to Italy and leading right up to a stranger's disturbing appearance in town.\"\u2013Library JournalPraise for the Big Stone Gap novels:\u201cDelightfully quirky . . . chock-full of engaging, oddball characters and unexpected plot twists.\u201d\u2013People (Book of the Week)\u201cFunny, charming, and original.\u201d\u2013Fannie Flagg\u201cSatisfying reading . . .

        "Title": "Roasting: A Simple Art",
        "Authors": "By Kafka, Barbara",
        "Description": "When you're hungry, roast.  When you're in a rush, roast.  When you're in doubt, roast.  When you're entertaining, roast.  Crank up the oven and throw in a chicken; roasting is simply the easiest and best way to concentrate and deepen flavor, to seal in succulence, and make robust, crusty, and sweet all kinds of meats, birds, fish, fruits, and vegetables. Roasting offers more flavor on its own than any other cooking technique. Everything you need for a lifetime of happy roasting can be found here in the pages of Barbara Kafka's ground-breaking new book. Even baby goat, a suckling pig, and loin of buffalo make it into this bible of roasting.   Roasting is absolutely essential, whether you're planning to roast a potato or leg of lamb, a turkey or a tomato, a pepper or a red snapper. Barbara's fussless high-temperature method caramelizes the surface of meat, the skin of birds or fish, or the outside of vegetables, transforming them into such savory sweet dishes as Roast Chicken with Pomegranate Glaze and Fresh Mint, aromatic Garlic Roast Pork Loin, moist and sweet Roasted Striped Bass with Fennel, and Whole Roasted Peaches with Ginger Syrup.  Nearly one hundred stellar recipes for roasted vegetables attest to the fact that Barbara Kafka's new book is not for meat eaters alone. The recipes for roasted vegetables begin where other books leave off. Try the Roasted Sliced Fennel Bulb and the Roasted Chinese Eggplant with Balsamic Marinade, the Roasted Portobello Mushrooms with Garlic Marinade, and more.   Roasting is packed with indispensable tips, techniques, and innovative cooking ideas. There are great recipes for marinades, salsas, vinaigrettes, and stuffings. You'll also find an inspiring assortment of simple but original recipes for sauces that will lift your everyday roasts into perfect party fare. You'll discover, too, the many joys of \"companion roasting,\" learning when to add the carrots or the onions so they don't over- or undercook, and guaranteeing everything comes out at the same time.  Never a believer in unnecessary work, Barbara Kafka is a cook's best friend. Barbara never follows; she blazes new trails, challenging the sacred rules of roasting by never trussing a chicken or basting a turkey. She proves you can actually walk away from your oven and enjoy your food and your guests. It's all so quick and easy, most dishes don't need to go into the oven until your guests walk in the door.  Often the best part of the roast is the leftovers, and  Roasting is overflowing with possibilities. In Barbara's knowing hands leftover onions become a smoky-flavored Roasted Onion Soup with Cannellini Beans; last night's roasted cod and boiled potatoes are transformed into a scrumptious Best Cod Hash; a deeply flavored Roast Duck Pasta Sauce is a rich reward to the cook for having made last night's duck dinner. Nearly one hundred recipes for leftovers show you how to build them into new meals of soups, salads, pasta sauces, hashes, fritters, fish cakes, and more.  Replete with all the tables, timing charts, and the encyclopedic wisdom that are hallmarks of every Barbara Kafka book,  Roasting: A Simple Art is a dream of a cookbook, one that will soon bear the soils, stains, and well-worn pages of constant and creative use.",

These services, which will be connected together to create the information technology systems of the future, will require less custom software in our organizations and more creativity in the connections between the services. This book begins with a high-level example of how an average person in an organization might interact with a service-oriented architecture. As the book progresses, more technical detail is added in a \"peeling of the onion\" approach. The leadership opportunities within these developing service-oriented architectures are also explained. At the end of the book there is a compendium or \"pocket library\" for software technology related to service-oriented architectures. \u00b7 Only web services book to cover both data management and software engineering perspectives, excellent resource for ALL members of IT teams \u00b7 Jargon free, highly illustrated, with introduction that anyone can read that then leads into increasing technical detail \u00b7 Provides a set of leadership principles and suggested application for using this technology.",

On September 11, 2001, a long history of failures and missteps came to a head, with tragic results. But, explains Naftali, it didn't have to be so. Blind Spot traces the long history of American efforts to thwart terrorism, from World War II to the Munich Games hostage-taking to the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. In riveting detail, based on original research and interviews with the key participants, Naftali describes why our early successes in counterterrorism did not translate into success against Osama bin Laden later in the 1990s, and why, until 9/11, the domestic threat of terrorism was the largest blind spot in United States national security.",

        "Description": "Sleep better, live longer with the groundbreaking information and step-by-step program in this revolutionary book.Healthful sleep has been empirically proven to be the single most important factor in predicting longevity, more influential than diet, exercise, or heredity. And yet we are a sleep-sick society, ignorant of the facts of sleep--and the price of sleep deprivation. In this groundbreaking book, based on decades of study on the frontiers of sleep science, Dr. William Dement, founder and director of the Stanford University Sleep Research Center, explains what happens when we sleep, when we don't, and how we can reclaim the most powerful--and underrated--health miracle of all. Taking us on a fascinating tour of our sleeping body and mind, Dr. Dement reveals the price we have paid for ignoring sleep--an epidemic of heart disease, 33 percent of traffic-fatigue-related accidents, and immeasurable mental and psychological disadvantages. And he offers a hands-on prescription for vibrant good health and longevity, including...self-tests to determine how much sleep you really need...the role of prescription and over-the-counter sleeping aids...the latest research on how sleep affects the immune system...how to combat insomnia, snoring, and jet lag...plus information on sleep disorder clinics nationwide, Web sites, and more.Taking readers on a fascinating tour of our sleeping body and mind, Dr. William C.

        "Description": "As the World Wide Web continues to expand, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to obtain information efficiently. Because most search engines read format languages such as HTML or SGML, search results reflect formatting tags more than actual page content, which is expressed in natural language. Spinning the Semantic Web describes an exciting new type of hierarchy and standardization that will replace the current \"web of links\" with a \"web of meaning.\" Using a flexible set of languages and tools, the Semantic Web will make all available information -- display elements, metadata, services, images, and especially content -- accessible. The result will be an immense repository of information accessible for a wide range of new applications.This first handbook for the Semantic Web covers, among other topics, software agents that can negotiate and collect information, markup languages that can tag many more types of information in a document, and knowledge systems that enable machines to read Web pages and determine their reliability. The truly interdisciplinary Semantic Web combines aspects of artificial intelligence, markup languages, natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, intelligent agents, and databases.",

Former sheriff of the island, Tonneman has now settled into life as husband, father, and businessman. But suddenly the air is filled with terror, an old debt has come due, and events have compelled the Dutchman back to duty.From the taverns and into the streets, the whispers grow louder by the hour - talk of devil worship and of witchcraft, dark tales of a conspiracy among the Jews. And when the killer trades horseflesh for human flesh, his knife slashing with deadly sacrificial precision, the city's simmering hatreds and superstitions threaten to boil and burn. Ostracized, distrusted, too independent for her own good, no one is more at risk than Tonneman's wife. A murderer is on the loose in New-York, and many are ready to blame Racqel. But someone is ready to make her the next victim.",
