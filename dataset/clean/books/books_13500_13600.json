        "Authors": "By French, Marilyn",
        "Description": "Marilyn French has written an extraordinary novel about four sisters who come to terms with the haunting past they share - opening up, discovering themselves and one another for the first time.Their father, the rich and powerful Stephen Upton, lies in the hospital following a stroke. His four daughters - each born of a different mother and ranging widely in age - are estranged from one another. Gathered in Upton's country mansion, awaiting his recovery - or death - they eye one another suspiciously. The eldest, Elizabeth, cold, acerbic, a government economist, takes charge of running the household, just as her father would have expected. Mary, beautiful, charming, a social jet-setter, secretly agonizes about money and finding another wealthy husband. Alex desperately wants to be close to her sisters, but they mock her warmth, kindness, and lack of sophistication. And Ronnie, born of Upton's affair with his Mexican housekeeper, sleeps in the maid's room, feeling her sisters' contempt.Buried within each of them lies their father's legacy - the anger, resentment, and disillusionment they share but have borne silently all these years. At first it is their feelings of pain, rage, and fear that bind them, that continue to cast shadows over their lives. But slowly the walls between them begin to crumble and they come to accept, understand, even love one another. In the novel's powerful and cathartic climax, they are at last able to confront the father they share with what he has done to them. Marilyn French has created a profoundly moving novel in which four women discover sisterhood, and sisterhood sets them free.",

        "Description": "Many Democrats in the Senate are fearful of George W. Bush and \"his unscrupulous political strategist, Karl Rove,\" writes Elizabeth Drew. The House, meanwhile, is run by Republican Whip Tom DeLay, \"the mean-spirited partisan from Texas\" who has polarized the chamber along party lines.How did we get to this point under a president who ran on a promise to unite rather than divide, and how has our government been affected?Elizabeth Drew's answers to these questions begin by exposing the cynicism of the Bush presidential campaign, orchestrated by Rove. She also reveals the deep division between the neocons in the Defense Department and the realists in the State Department. The controversy between the two camps, she finds, has \"brought out bitterness and knife-wielding of a sort that Washington has seldom seen.\" The result, she concludes, is that \"the increasing unwillingness to compromise is not only blocking legislation but, it is not overdramatic to say, is subverting fundamental concepts of democracy.\"Russell Baker in his preface writes: \"In Washington an age of moral and philosophical sterility is deeply entrenched, and as Elizabeth Drew's reporting attests, the result is not pretty .... Since [the end of the cold war] government has seemed to be mostly about raising money to get elected, and then reelected repeatedly in order to service those who put up the money. There is no moral urgency in it, no philosophical imperative at work.\"",

While still a schoolgirl in braids, she takes her first lover, a dissident student. The more she understands of adult life, however, the more disdainful she is of its deceptions, and the more she loses herself in her one true passion: the ancient game of go.Incredibly for a teenager\u2013and a girl at that\u2013she dominates the games in her town.

As the clash of their peoples becomes ever more desperate and inescapable, and as each one\u2019s untold life begins to veer wildly off course, the girl and the soldier are absorbed by only one thing\u2013the progress of their game, each move of which brings them closer to their shocking fate.In The Girl Who Played Go, Shan Sa has distilled the piercing emotions of adolescence into an engrossing, austerely beautiful story of love, cruelty and loss of innocence.",

        "Description": "The classic Our Bodies, Ourselves advised women to seek alternatives to the established medical system. Our Health, Our Lives demonstrates how medicine can function when it serves women's needs, and shows women how to help start that process in their own lives. All women can be empowered to use the health care system to full advantage, to understand female physiology and psychology, to know what questions to ask, and to receive primary care based on the differences that make women's health problems and solutions unique.Offering positive advice with a personal voice, Dr. Hoffman covers an impressive range of topics, including special chapters on heart disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, fatigue and the immune system, sexuality, menstrual periods, pregnancy, menopause, stress and depression, eating disorders, and addiction. She explains why female hormonal actions give women pathways to illness and health that are different from men's, and illustrates the remarkable effect of these hormonal actions on the cycles of women's lives. Women's bodies here are viewed as complete and complex entities; ovarian function is described as it relates to fertility and to healthy hearts and strong bones. Dr. Hoffman also discusses why male-centered models of psychological development and behavior fail to explain female patterns. With risk assessment, practical preventive measures, screening recommendations, and the latest, most comprehensive information, Our Health, Our Lives is an unparalleled compendium of women's health.",

        "Description": "\"When last we met, George Bush had just been inaugurated president, Ronald Reagan was waving goodbye to Washington in a helicopter flyby and I had just come back to New York, where I finished a book about being a speechwriter for both. Ultimately my son and I ensconced ourselves in the top of a house in one of Manhattan's old brownstone neighborhoods, where I set up shop as a writer.\"Because of...the facts of my life, I know and have dealings with many people, and am invited to visit their circles, their rings. It is a various world.\"This is in part about that world. It is not a book about big events, but about the day-to-day of thinking and living in a particular era. It is not so much about politics as about life viewed from an inescapably political perspective. And if there is any revolution in it, it is one that is happening within me.\"Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness begins with particulars. Life is in the details: rediscovering home after a five-year absence; learning where parenthood intersects - and sometimes clashes - with modern culture; measuring the distance between the old and the new America; deciding what one's values are and working out how to live by them within America's unruly cultural landscape. All aspects of our life in America are ennobled through Noonan's gift of observation, for grasping that the profound resides at the heart of the mundane.But as the details of Noonan's life accumulate, they begin to point outward, rippling beyond private interests, brushing against large questions. In \"Liberty,\" Noonan turns to our precarious political culture, and the people who populate it. Ironically, for Noonan, liberty means both freedom from an overtly political life and immersion in it. She takes a tough look at the 1992 Bush campaign, and a hard look at the victor in that election, Bill Clinton - whom she sees as a one-term president.Political culture is not, however, the farthest-flung colony in \"The Pursuit of Happiness.\" From her base in America's cultural capital, New York, Noonan's musings lead her beyond the issues that concern us in the world, to those about which the new America is considerably less confident. Noonan writes of her struggles with reclaiming her faith, with finding a place for God in a country replete with the temptations of Mammon.Throughout Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, Peggy Noonan's warmth, wit and wisdom help us remember some of the things Americans know in their hearts, but often forget in their heads. Sharing in her struggles and her victories helps to put the shine back on life in America in the latter days of the twentieth century.",

But every now and then a call from the breezily efficient Dot sends him off to kill a total stranger. He takes a plane, rents a car, finds a hotel room, and gets back before the body is cold.He's a real pro, cool and dispassionate and very good at what he does. Until one day when Dot breaks her own rule and books him for a hit in New York, his home base. She sends him to an art gallery opening, and the girl he gets lucky with steers him to an astrologer. He's a Gemini, his moon's in Taurus . . . and he's got a murderer's thumb.Then the jobs start to go wrong. Targets die before he can draw a bead on them. The realization is slow in coming, but there's no getting around it: Somebody out there is trying to hit the hit man. Keller, God help him, has found his way on to somebody else's hit list.Darker than Keller's conscience, and as riveting, surprising, and wickedly funny as his sensational New York Times bestselling debut, Hit Man, Lawrence Block's Hit List only serves to confirm the Wall Street Journal's estimation of the multiple-award-winning author as \"one of the very best writers now working the beat.\"",

In 1953 the discovery was shown to have been a hoax.In an amazing blend of fine historical documentation and artful fiction, this book should set to rest all questions about the Piltdown hoax. The text of \"On the matter of Eoanthropus dawsoni,\" the reminiscences of Charles Dawson, is scrupulously annotated here and filled with maps, photos, and diagrams that demonstrate how this meek Edwardian anthropologist succeeded in making monkeys out of Darwin's most ardent advocates.From these annotated pages emerges a darker tale, as we learn what the staid, journalistic studies of the nearly century-old hoax have never told us: about a group of Evangelical extremists who would not stop at murder to suppress support for Darwin's heretical views...about the young priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who enraged members of the Church with his belief that God had created beings that could evolve... about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whose real-life sleuthings and interest in spiritualism had led him to investigate the Piltdown affair on his own. The forces of progress and faith clash dramatically in a pastoral English Eden where discovery of the Origin of Man could lead to certain death.Was Dawson the true perpetrator of the Piltdown hoax? Only his modern-day annotator knows for sure, and his identity is perhaps the greatest hoax of all....",

        "Description": "The Best of Times--the '90s were indeed the best of times. Unprecedented wealth and the breathtaking progress of science and technology ushered in the Internet and the deciphering of the genome. Promises abounded, but a deepening sense of unease hovered over America as the worst of times seemed to be upon us as well-gossip, scandal, and a frenzied media like nothing ever seen before. Based on exclusive interviews with the decade's most influential players, here is a fascinating re-creation of the best and worst episodes of the decade. With sweeping force and cultural acumen, Johnson revives the '90s, the ups and downs, filled with all that we may have forgotten and, most importantly, all that we never knew. In four fascinating parts, Johnson delivers the stories behind the stories-revealing the personalities behind the media party of the '90s, the partisanship that didn't succeed in bringing down the president, the pervasive technology that stretched from Silicon Valley to Monsanto with the corresponding hopes and fears, and the equally extreme reactions on Wall Street to every last bit of it. A tremendous work from a major authority and writer, The Best of Times covers the entire wonderful yet woeful decade, gavel to gavel.Includes interviews with:Book One: TechnotimesNathan Myhrvold, chief technology guru (former), MicrosoftDavid Baltimore, president, Cal Tech University and Nobel Prize winnerBob Shapiro, chief executive officer, Monsanto Regis McKenna, entrepreneurBook Two: TeletimesTed Harbert, head of TV programming, DreamWorks SKGNorman Lear, creator of \"All in the Family\"David Geffen, partner, DreamWorks SKGMichael Bloomberg, head of Bloomberg NewsSteven Brill, founder of Brill's ContentBook Three: Scandal Times Sam Dash, law professor, GeorgetownSenator Alan K. Simpson (former)Senator Dale Bumpers (former)Book Four: Millennial TimesSenator Bob Kerrey (former)Senator John McCainDr. Ruth Faden, medical ethicistIn addition, Johnson interviewed leaders of Congress, top White House aides, cabinet members, and prominent political operatives of both parties in gathering material for this history.A JAMES H.

        "Authors": "By Harris, Joanne",
        "Description": "Before the sweet delight of Chocolat, before the heady concoction that is Blackberry Wine, and before the tart pleasures of Five Quarters of the Orange, bestselling author Joanne Harris wrote Sleep, Pale Sister -- a gothic tourde-force that recalls the powerfully dark sensibility of her novel Holy Fools.Originally published in 1994 -- and never before available in the United States -- Sleep, Pale Sister is a hypnotically atmospheric story set in nineteenth century London. When puritanical artist Henry Chester sees delicate child beauty Effie, he makes her his favorite model and, before long, his bride. But Henry, volatile and repressed, is in love with an ideal. Passive, docile, and asexual, the woman he projects onto Effie is far from the woman she really is. And when Effie begins to discover the murderous depths of Henry's hypocrisy, her latent passion will rise to the surface.Sleep, Pale Sister combines the ethereal beauty of a Pre-Raphaelite painting with a chilling high gothic tale and is a testament to Harris's brimming cornucopia of talents.This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",
