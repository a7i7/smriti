        "Title": "Familiar Strangers: Uncommon Wisdom in Unlikely Places",
        "Authors": "By Chopra, Gotham",
        "Description": "A flip through the newspaper or a glance at the evening news reveals a world in which old ways are dying and new worlds are beginning, often in the midst of violence and chaos. In the face of these massive changes and disruptions, many people are questioning their roles as individuals: Why am I here? What is my purpose? In Familiar Strangers, Gotham Chopra travels from China, Sri Lanka, and Kashmir to Chechnya and the Yucat\u00e1n in search of answers to these age-old spiritual questions. Everywhere he goes, he encounters people who have had to dig within themselves to survive horrible realities and bear heart-wrenching losses. From his New York to Los Angeles flight on September 11, 2001 to a harrowing week spent among young boys toting guns in the contested hills of Kashmir and a sojourn in a small Yucat\u00e1n village where he witnesses firsthand the collision between the romance of the past and the uncertain promise of the future, Chopra shares the wisdom, idealism, and sense of purpose he found in ordinary people living under extraordinary circumstances. Rich in drama and insights into cultures far different from our own, the stories Chopra recounts articulate, as well, anxieties and fears we all share. While acknowledging that his travels often take him to the extreme edges of civilized society, Chopra shows that the questions that arise in times of peril or in the face of great dangers are not so different from what many of us ask in the course of our daily lives\u2013whether after a grueling eighty-hour work week, a six-hour exam, or a fiery argument with a lover. The challenge, he argues, is to use these moments of revelation as the first step in moving beyond self-imposed fears and limits and embracing new opportunities for spiritual growth.",

Though he himself has covered many campaigns, run for President several times, and run for cover at the rainy inauguration of George W. Bush (the man will spare nothing for his art) Barry has instead outdone himself.Below the Beltway\u00a0includes Barry's stirring account of how the United States was born, including his version of a properly rewritten Declaration (When in the course of human events it behooves us, the people, not to ask \"What can our country do for us, anyway?\" but rather whether we have anything to fear except fear itself...)and a revised Constitution (Section II: The House of Representatives shall be composed of people who own at least two dark suits and have not been indicted recently.).Dave also cracks the income tax code, explains the growth(s) of government, congressional hearing difficulties, and the persistent rumors of the influence of capital in the Capitol. Among other civic contributions, his tour of Washington, D.C., should end school class trips forever.",

        "Description": "\"Talking the process of change and teaching is a necessity for our intellectual and social well-being,\" says acclaimed author Regie Routman. Now, in this long-awaited volume, Routman continues the discussion she began in the best-selling Invitations and further explores the full universe of an effective language arts and literacy program across the curriculum. Filled with an array of field-tested teaching ideas, detailed strategies, reviews of theory, teacher-crafted lessons, and lists of resources, Conversations is all you need to become an informed, confident professional, sensitive to your students' needs and interests. What's more, it incorporates Routman's perspective on important topical issues such as curricular rigor, direct teaching, specific skills, and daily monitoring.  Conversations is grounded in the belief that the connections, interactions, reflections, and new thinking that evolve from rich dialogue define what we know. It was written, in part, to spur teachers to challenge assumptions, clarify their own learning, and take the lead in their own professional development. While this is not a book about a particular methodology, Routman does explore current theory and practice, and supports her views with classroom-based and scientific research. The book is upbeat and practical; each chapter is self-contained and can be read in any order. As Routman shares her own experiences and resources - through narratives, anecdotes, step-by-step demonstrations, and examples of students' work - we may find ourselves questioning, modifying, validating, or changing our own practices. Most of all, we will find ourselves talking. And here is where the conversation begins.  Text chapters: 656pp  -  The Blue Pages: Resources for Teachers: 240pp",

        "Description": "Grange, Florida, is famous for its miracles--the weeping fiberglass Madonna, the Road-Stain Jesus, the stigmata man. And now it has JoLayne Lucks, unlikely winner of the state lottery.Unfortunately, JoLayne's winning ticket isn't the only one. The other belongs to Bodean Gazzer and his raunchy sidekick, Chub, who believe they're entitled to the whole $28 million jackpot. And they need it quickly, to start their own underground militia before NATO troops invade America.But JoLayne Lucks has her own plans for the Lotto money--an Eden-like forest in Grange must be saved from strip-malling. When Bode and Chub brutally assault her and steal her ticket, JoLayne vows to track them down, take it back--and get revenge.The only one who can help is Tom Krome, a big-city investigative journalist now bitterly consigned to writing frothy features for a midsized central Florida newspaper. With a persuasive nudge from JoLayne, Krome is about to become part of a story that's bigger and more bizarre than anything he's ever covered.Chasing two heavily armed psychopaths down the coast of Florida is reckless enough, but Tom's got other problems--the murderous attention of a jealous judge; an actress wife who turns fugitive to avoid divorce court; an editor who speaks in tongues; and Tom's own growing fondness for the future millionairess with whom he's risking his neck.The pursuit takes them from the surreal streets of Grange to a buzzard-infested island deep in Florida Bay, where they finally catch up with the fledgling militia--Chub, Bode Gazzer, a newly recruited convenience-store clerk and their baffled hostage, a Hooters waitress.The climax explodes with the hilarious mayhem that is Carl Hiaasen's hallmark. Lucky You is his funniest, most deliriously gripping novel yet.",

        "Description": "The splendor and beauty of a child\u2019s growth and development in the womb--seen through unforgettable images made possible by revolutionary advances in visualization technologyWhat\u2019s happening with the baby now?  All expectant parents ask this question throughout the exhilirating months of pregnancy.  Fuzzy sonograms and doctor\u2019s explanations can provide basic information, but through Alexander Tsiaras\u2019 remarkable achievements in medical imaging technology, parents can see, for the first time, the awe-inspiring process of a new life unfolding, in stunning, vivid detail.The milestones of pregnancy which before could only be described can now be witnessed:  the heart\u2019s first beats; the appearance of color in the eye; the emergence of toes and teeth; the brain and nervous system directing development; the first movement of tiny legs and arms; the first indications of gender; the wondrous symbiosis of mother and child; the symphony of the body\u2019s systems coming into being and working in concert. The book tracks the development of a baby from the moment of conception, through the explosively complex early stages of development and the amazing stages of growth as the baby is nurtured by the mother, ending with the joy of birth.All this is made possible by revolutions in two sciences.  As biologists have decoded the molecular basis of life, computer scientists have developed non-invasive, three-dimensional techniques for visualizing the body.  Alexander Tsiaras has been a pioneer in merging these explorations and discoveries.  He has created a virtual camera studio that enables him to view a human body or any part of it individually, scan it, enlarge it, rotate it, adjust its transparency so that we can view inside a living being, and light it from any angle.  The result is an ability to illuminate the unseen elements that make us who we are, and the miraculous images in From Conception to Birth.",

If she can convince one person - and she has chosen him - that she is telling the truth, she can stay when they come back for her. And she exposes her breasts as evidence, revealing square nipples. His least profound response is to drop his cigarette into the crease in his chair. So begins the wildest SF novel since the passing of Philip K. Dick. Patrick O'Leary's Door Number Three is a constant wellspring of surprise and wonder, a novel about a young man of today and a woman from somewhere else who is out to love or kill him - or both. The whole, apparently real, world and everything in it can never be the same again.",

        "Description": "A towering multi-volume fantasy, The Pearl, is launched by Eric Van Lustbader in The Ring of Five Dragons. Lustbader, one of the most famous and popular writers of the last three decades, returns to the fantasy genre with his most ambitious work yet. Filled with action, colour, and the myriad details of another world, The Pearl is the first great new fantasy series epic of the new millennium, set to rival Robert Jordan, David Eddings, and Terry Goodkind in popular appeal. The Kundalan people have suffered for a century under the viciously oppressive, technologically-superior Vornn invaders. In the resulting crisis of faithwhy hasnt their goddess Miina saved them?Kundalan religion falls under the control of evil forces from within. They, pretending to have no magic of their own and forbid the teaching of traditional sorcery. The Vornns mysterious leaders, the Gyrgon, search for the lost Ring of Five Dragons, the key to the door of the fabled Kundalan Storehouse, and perhaps to Kundalan sorcery as well. Misused, the ring triggers seemingly inexorable annihilation for Vornn and Kundalan alike. Now, from among the oppressed, must arise the hero of prophecy, the Dar Sala-at, who alone can wield the sorcerous power to save the world. Thus begins a huge epic, rooted in the conflict between spiritual and technological civilizations, that confronts difficult moral and cultural questions in a manner reminiscent of Frank Herberts Dune.",

In If You Could See Me Now, she takes that theme a step further, offering us a heroine who is entirely believable, and the new man in her life who is, well, slightly less so.Elizabeth Egan's life runs on order: Both her home and her emotions are arranged just so, with little room for spontaneity. It's how she counteracts the chaos of her family--an alcoholic mother who left when she was young, an emotionally distant father, and a free-spirited sister, who seems to be following in their mother's footsteps, leaving her own six-yearold son, Luke, in Elizabeth's care. When Ivan, Luke's mysterious new grown-up friend, enters the picture, Elizabeth doesnt know quite what to make of him. With his penchant for adventure and colorful take on things large and small, Ivan opens Elizabeth's eyes to a whole new way of living. But is it for real? Is Ivan for real?If You Could See Me Now is a love story with heart--and just a touch of magic.",

Of the  various English translations of Freud's major  works to appear in his lifetime, only one was  authorized by Freud himself: The Standard  Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of  Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of  James Strachey.Freud approved the overall  editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes,  from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of  the translations were done by Strachey himself;  the rest were prepared under his supervision.  The result was to place the Standard Edition in  a position of unquestioned supremacy over all  other existing versions.Newly designed in a  uniform format, each new paperback in the  Standard Edition opens with a biographical essay on Freud's life and work \u2014along with a note on  the individual volume\u2014by Peter Gay, Sterling  Professor of History at Yale.",
