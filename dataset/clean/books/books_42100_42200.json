        "Description": "On one recent Fourth of July, Peggy and I skipped the manmade fireworks. Instead, we pulled a few lawn chairs past our gazebo into the Garden of Youth to watch nature's own pyrotechnics, the cosmic dance of the evening primrose blossoms and the hawk moths.... We felt calm and peaceful. We felt alive. Rejuvenated. Young.--From chapter 1For Dr. Jim Duke, even gazing at the blossoms of his favorite herb can be an anti-aging activity. His passion for medicinal plants is understandable: They help him feel and look younger than his 72 years.Dr. Duke is convinced that almost all plants contain compounds that can slow aging and minimize its effects on the body and mind. In The Green Pharmacy Anti-Aging Prescriptions, he identifies the herbs and foods that he believes deliver on the promise of lifelong youth.Some of these plants are familiar, like ginkgo for a sharp memory and garlic for...well, just about anything. Others are just beginning to attract attention, like pigweed to strengthen bones and astragalus to boost the immune system.While Dr. Duke specializes in medicinal plants, he firmly believes that a healthy diet and regular exercise must round out any anti-aging plan. That's why this book combines herbal preventives and treatments with nutritional recommendations and lifestyle strategies.But Dr. Duke isn't advocating a formal anti-aging \"program\" or \"regimen.\" He's giving you choices, so you can develop your own anti-aging plan, based on your unique needs and concerns.By taking the right herbs, eating the right foods, and making some minor lifestyle adjustments, you can stay healthy and maintain your youthful zest for life. Getting older has never felt so good!",

        "Description": "Today an estimated 30 million Americans are struggling with the healthcare issues of elderly parents - many of them from far away. How can we be sure our parents are being well cared for, how can we protect them from abuse? In Is Your Parent in Good Hands? attorney Edward Carnot offers sound practical advice on these troubling issues - based on his personal and professional experience.. He tells the compelling story of his own battle against the unscrupulous caregiver of his elderly father, the inability of the legal system to protect him, and the resulting chaos that turned his family inside out and ultimately threatened the dignity and independence his father so tenaciously clung to. Though his story has a sad ending, Carnot discovered much that can help others in their quest to protect their aging loved ones. Now he offers expert advice for both recognizing financial exploitation and abuse and the many ways abuse can be prevented. Each chapter includes easy-to-understand vital information on topics ranging from the need for legal documents, such as power of attorney for healthcare and living wills; guardianships, working with officials, police, and the district attorney; to health insurance issues, like the difference between Medicare, Medigap, and long-term care insurance, choosing a residential care facility, including how to determine whether to hire a nurse or private caregiver and when to use an agency; recognizing depression and loneliness; the differences among mental health professionals; senior centers; estate planning issues like reverse mortgages; to planning for long-term care as a family - everything you need to care for and protect your elderly parents - from nearby or faraway. The book will help everyone who has an aging parent or close relative because the story is compelling, the reader can easily identify with the characters, and the self-help guidelines are comprehensive, practical and immediately usable.

        "Description": "Hindenburg: An Illustrated History chronicles the complete story of the great dirigibles - from the pioneering efforts of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin to the brief career of the Hindenburg's little-known sister ship, the Graf Zeppelin II. At the turn of the century zeppelins established the world's first passenger-carrying airline. But World War I bombing raids over London earned them the label \"baby-killers.\" In the postwar years Great Britain and the United States competed with Germany for the prestige of building the world's most advanced airship. The British envisioned an empire linked by a fleet of silver giants. For the United States Navy, the zeppelin would be a flying aircraft carrier, transporting fighter planes in its belly.By the late 1920s it seemed that the airship was poised to conquer the skies. In 1926 explorer Roald Amundsen flew across the Arctic Ocean in the dirigible Norge. An ecstatic New York ticker-tape parade greeted the Graf Zeppelin at the end of her pioneering 1929 round-the-world flight. The Graf soon went on to establish the first ever non-stop transatlantic air service.But not all airship enterprises ended in triumph. Two years after the Norge's Arctic exploit, the Italia crashed on a polar ice floe, stranding her surviving crew for forty-nine days. And the first intercontinental flight of the British airship R 101 ended in flames in a French field. The U.S. Navy airships Akron and Macon were wrecked by storms at sea within two years of each other. A haunting photo mosaic shows the site where underwater cameras recently located the skeleton of the huge dirigible Macon on the ocean floor, lying with the Sparrowhawk fighters that were once housed in her internal hangar.Hindenburg: An Illustrated History vividly re-creates a time when many believed that lighter-than-air craft held the promise of the future. Highlighted by a highly readable, informative text and illustrated with hundreds of breathtaking images, this magnificent book brings to life a remarkable chapter in the history of flight.",

Their relationship is already strained for reasons Leigh does not fully understand when, in a moment of carelessness, Kara makes a mistake that ends in tragedy -- the effects of which not only divide Leigh's family, but polarize the entire community. We see the story from Leigh's perspective, as she grapples with the hard reality of what her daughter has done and the devastating consequences her actions have on the family of another teenage girl in town, all while struggling to protect Kara in the face of rising public outcry.Like the best works of Jane Hamilton, Jodi Picoult, and Alice Sebold, Laura Moriarty's The Rest of Her Life is a novel of complex moral dilemma, filled with nuanced characters and a page-turning plot that makes readers ask themselves, \"What would I do\"",

        "Title": "The Case for Impeachment: The Legal Argument for Removing President George W. Bush from Office",
        "Authors": "By Lindorff, Dave and Olshansky, Barbara",
        "Description": "The war in Iraq . . .\u00a0No bid contracts awarded to Halliburton . . .\u00a0Hurricane Katrina . . .\u00a0The CIA leak investigation . . .\u00a0The story gets worse and worse. The evidence is glaring. George W. Bush\u2019s record as a president is abysmal. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And it\u2019s time to impeach him. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Case for Impeachment lays out the reasons why in a straightforward, letter-of-the-law manner. Mixing the cold, hard facts with the lies and deceptions of this administration, The Case for Impeachment is a serious consideration of Bush\u2019s high crimes and misdemeanors while in office. This important and timely book will serve as a rallying cry for all those fed up with George W. Bush\u2019s abuses of power.\u00a0It's time for the American people and Congress to act. With so much at stake, we have a president whose administration stands out in its criminality and disdain for the rule of law. The Case for Impeachment explains the legal history and grounds for impeaching George W. Bush and brings forth more than a half dozen articles of impeachment the likes of:*Lying and inducing Congress and the American people into an unjust war.*Allowing his friends and business cronies to profiteer off the war in Iraq.*Authorizing torture and rendition of prisoners of war and suspected terrorists--a complete violation of the Geneva Conventions, a treaty the U.S. has signed and is therefore part of our law.*Stripping American citizens of their Constitutional rights--holding people with no charge, wiretapping them illegally, offering them no trial, and never allowing them to face their accusers.*Failing in almost every way possible to defend the homeland and our borders.Hard hitting and persuasive in its argument, The Case for Impeachment will be one of the most talked-about political books for the pathetic remainder of the Bush Presidency.\u00a0As timely as today's headlines, this vital book explains why impeachment should be deployed against the serial Constitution-shredder George W. Bush. The third article of impeachment against Richard Nixon was illegal spying on Americans--a crime indisputably committed also by Bush and his cronies. But this book also makes a compelling case that Bush has arrogantly flouted his oath of office and the laws of the land by committing other impeachableoffenses--telling lies to Congress and the American people to take us into an illegal war, violating the War Powers act, abusing the power of his office, failing to protect the United States, and more. Dave Lindorff (a first-rate independent progressive journalist) and Barbara Olshansky (a dedicated civil liberties attorney), in The Case for Impeachment, have restored this vital tool to the arsenal of democracy. Any American who wants to preserve what's left of our precious Bill of Rights from further encroachments, and to repair the Constitutional separation of powers vitiated by George Bush, should read this essential book -- which should also be force-fed to every single member of Congress.-- Doug Ireland, columnist for the LA Weekly\u00a0\"In the United States, our best journalism is published in books now and talked about on the radio and the internet. If you get your news from a television or a newspaper, you live in another world. This no doubt contributes to how divided we are politically. Dave Lindorff's and Barbara Olshansky's book could help bridge this national divide. The genius of this book is in its brevity. Lindorff and Olshansky have boiled the list of Bush and Cheney's documented crimes down to an amazingly concise summary, one that however gives a real flavor of the goings on in this criminal administration. I work on these issues and still learned a great deal by reading this book. If each of us who knows some of this and is able to process it easily buys ten copies to give to people who get their news from TV, this clear crisp book might just help save this country.\"-- David Swanson, co-founder AfterDowningStreet.org\u00a0The impeachment of George W. Bush today seems politically unlikely. But Lindorff and Olshansky insist that we not avert our eyes, that it is not OK to tolerate a president who \"revokes the basic constitutional rights of American citizenship\"--locking people up indefinitely without trial, claiming a right to ignore laws and court orders. President Bush justifies his violations of the Constitution by citing the emergency of a war which is in truth \"a police action against stateless terrorists\"--a crusade which can thus have \"no beginning and no end,\" Lindorff and Olshansky forcefully argue. If Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about having sex, they ask, how much more dangerous is it to shrug off the corrosive impact of a president who knowingly lied the nation into a costly and counterproductive war in Iraq? The authors then proceed to meticulously document their case that many of the false grounds for war were, indeed, knowing lies. \"If we fail to stand up for the Constitution now,\" they warn, \"it may only be a piece of paper by the end of President Bush's second term.\"--Vin Suprynowicz, Las Vegas Review Journal",

Welcome to the Custer Hill Club--an informal men's club set in a luxurious Adirondack hunting lodge whose members include some of America's most powerful business leaders, military men, and government officials. Ostensibly, the club is a place to gather with old friends, hunt, eat, drink, and talk off-the-record about war, life, death, sex and politics. But one Fall weekend, the Executive Board of the Custer Hill Club gathers to talk about the tragedy of 9/11 and what America must do to retaliate. Their plan is finalized and set into motion.  That same weekend, a member of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force is reported missing. His body is soon discovered in the woods near the Custer Hill Club's game reserve. The death appears to be a hunting accident, and that's how the local police first report it, but Detective John Corey has his doubts. As he digs deeper, he begins to unravel a plot involving the Custer Hill Club, a top-secret plan known only by its code name: Wild Fire. Racing against the clock, Detective Corey and his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, find they are the only people in a position to stop the button from being pushed and chaos from being unleashed.",

Grandpa once danced on the vaudeville stage, and as he glides across the  floor, the children can see what it was like to be a song and dance man. Gammell  captures all the story's inherent joie de vivre with color pencil renderings that  leap off the pages. Bespectacled, enthusiastic Grandpa clearly exudes the message  that you're only as old as you feel, but the children respond--as will readers--to  the nostalgia of the moment. Utterly original.\"--(starred) Booklist.",

McKay takes the forced detour in stride - until a strange noise comes from deep inside the crate.

And it is set to go off within hours.As panic spreads from the small community of nuclear scientists who used to work for Dr. Rogers Henry to the White House and eventually to the general public, a group of rogue military officers conspires to disobey the President's orders and secure the technology of the Medusa device, whatever the cost.

Gradually, a pattern begins to emerge, and it leads him to . . . certainly nothing he ever expected. Which is too bad, because the killers-and, yes, there is more than one of them-the killers are expecting him.

        "Description": "The triumphant conclusion to the blockbuster trilogy that made science fiction history!In Dune: House Corrino Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson bring us the magnificent final chapter in the unforgettable saga begun in Dune: House Atreides and continued in Dune: House Harkonnen. Here nobles and commoners, soldiers and slaves, wives and courtesans shape the amazing destiny of a tumultuous universe. An epic saga of love and war, crime and politics, religion and revolution, this magnificent novel is a fitting conclusion to a great science fiction trilogy ... and an invaluable addition to the thrilling world of Frank Herbert\u2019s immortal Dune.Dune: House CorrinoFearful of losing his precarious hold on the Golden Lion Throne, Shaddam IV, Emperor of a Million Worlds, has devised a radical scheme to develop an alternative to melange, the addictive spice that binds the Imperium together and that can be found only on the desert world of Dune. In subterranean labs on the machine planet Ix, cruel Tleilaxu overlords use slaves and prisoners as part of a horrific plan to manufacture a synthetic form of melange known as amal. If amal can supplant the spice from Dune, it will give Shaddam what he seeks: absolute power.But Duke Leto Atreides, grief-stricken yet unbowed by the tragic death of his son Victor, determined to restore the honor and prestige of his House, has his own plans for Ix. He will free the Ixians from their oppressive conquerors and restore his friend Prince Rhombur, injured scion of the disgraced House Vernius, to his rightful place as Ixian ruler. It is a bold and risky venture, for House Atreides has limited military resources and many ruthless enemies, including the sadistic Baron Harkonnen, despotic master of Dune. Meanwhile, Duke Leto\u2019s consort, the beautiful Lady Jessica, obeying the orders of her superiors in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, has conceived a child that the Sisterhood intends to be the penultimate step in the creation of an all-powerful being. Yet what the Sisterhood doesn\u2019t know is that the child Jessica is carrying is not the girl they are expecting, but a boy. Jessica\u2019s act of disobedience is an act of love \u2014 her attempt to provide her Duke with a male heir to House Atreides \u2014 but an act that, when discovered, could kill both mother and baby. Like the Bene Gesserit, Shaddam Corrino is also concerned with making a plan for the future \u2014 securing his legacy. Blinded by his need for power, the Emperor will launch a plot against Dune, the only natural source of true spice. If he succeeds, his madness will result in a cataclysmic tragedy not even he foresees: the end of space travel, the Imperium, and civilization itself.With Duke Leto and other renegades and revolutionaries fighting to stem the tide of darkness that threatens to engulf their universe, the stage is set for a showdown unlike any seen before.",

        "Title": "Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad, 1863-1869",
        "Authors": "By Ambrose, Stephen E.",
        "Description": "In this account of an unprecedented feat of engineering, vision, and courage, Stephen E. Ambrose offers a historical successor to his universally acclaimed Undaunted Courage, which recounted the explorations of the West by Lewis and Clark. Nothing Like It in the World is the story of the men who built the transcontinental railroad -- the investors who risked their businesses and money; the enlightened politicians who understood its importance; the engineers and surveyors who risked, and lost, their lives; and the Irish and Chinese immigrants, the defeated Confederate soldiers, and the other laborers who did the backbreaking and dangerous work on the tracks.The Union had won the Civil War and slavery had been abolished, but Abraham Lincoln, who was an early and constant champion of railroads, would not live to see the great achievement. In Ambrose's hands, this enterprise, with its huge expenditure of brainpower, muscle, and sweat, comes to life.The U.S. government pitted two companies -- the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific Railroads -- against each other in a race for funding, encouraging speed over caution. Locomo-tives, rails, and spikes were shipped from the East through Panama or around South America to the West or lugged across the country to the Plains. This was the last great building project to be done mostly by hand: excavating dirt, cutting through ridges, filling gorges, blasting tunnels through mountains.At its peak, the workforce -- primarily Chinese on the Central Pacific, Irish on the Union Pacific -- approached the size of Civil War armies, with as many as fifteen thousand workers on each line. The Union Pacific was led by Thomas \"Doc\" Durant, Oakes Ames, and Oliver Ames, with Grenville Dodge -- America's greatest railroad builder -- as chief engineer. The Central Pacific was led by California's \"Big Four\": Leland Stanford, Collis Huntington, Charles Crocker, and Mark Hopkins. The surveyors, the men who picked the route, were latter-day Lewis and Clark types who led the way through the wilderness, living off buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope.In building a railroad, there is only one decisive spot -- the end of the track. Nothing like this great work had been seen in the world when the last spike, a golden one, was driven in at  Promontory Summit, Utah, in 1869, as the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific tracks were joined.Ambrose writes with power and eloquence about the brave men -- the famous and the unheralded, ordinary men doing the extraordinary -- who accomplished the spectacular feat that made the continent into a nation.",

Their instructions were simple: look beyond the daily news headlines, dig beneath the breaking stories, and capture what life is like on an ordinary day for the men and women of the United States Armed Forces around the world.For 24 consecutive hours, this prize-winning team of civilian and military photographers -- working with the cooperation and support of the Department of Defense -- chronicled daily life in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.The resulting book of photographs documents the lives of elite units and freshly minted recruits; of cadets, generals, fire-fighters, medics, and MPs; of soldiers at desolate outposts and on strategic bases. It illustrates life in the cockpit of a fighter, on a Trident submarine, in an underground missile silo, and at computer terminals in a war room. It shows personnel patrolling borders, jungles, mountains, and harbors; training for special operations; and fighting terrorism.It is a timeless portrait -- in indelible images and eloquent words -- of the men and women who wear the uniforms of the American military. They are your sons, daughters, spouses, neighbors, and friends.Together these photographs provide an inspiring visual reminder of the routine and heroic operations, the sacrifices and dedication, that are necessary to defend America's freedoms 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.",

After his death, she supported her children - Leonardo and Caterina - by starting a fashion house which has prospered. When she is kidnapped, the crime is reported to Marshal Guarnaccia by her daughter, who may have been the intended victim.Kidnapping is almost a second business for the Sardinians nominally engaged in raising sheep in the Tuscan hills. They inhabit a vast wilderness where a victim can be hidden away forever, and where those searching for her will be quickly spotted. The government's official policy is not to permit the payment of ransom. But if the money isn't paid, the kidnappers cannot let their victim go free. It would set a bad example.In this case, Guarnaccia suspects another problem. Can it be that her children are unwilling to pay the ransom? Is this more than a random crime?",

In Stealing Athena, Karen Essex chronicles the Marbles\u2019 amazing journey through the dynamic narratives of Mary Nisbet, wife of the Earl of Elgin, the British ambassador to Constantinople, and Aspasia, the mistress of Perikles, the most powerful man in Athens during that city\u2019s Golden Age.At the height of the Napoleonic Wars, the twenty-one-year-old, newly wed Countess of Elgin, a Scottish heiress and celebrated beauty, enchanted the power brokers of the Ottoman Empire, using her charms to obtain their permission for her husband\u2019s audacious plan to deconstruct the Parthenon and bring its magnificent sculptures to England. Two millennia earlier, Aspasia, a female philosopher and courtesan, and a central figure in Athenian life, plied her wits, allure, and influence with equal determination, standing with Perikles at the center of vehement opposition to his vision of building the most exquisite monuments the world had ever seen.Rich in romance and intrigue, greed and glory, Stealing Athena is an enthralling work of historical fiction and a window into the intimate lives of some of history\u2019s most influential and fascinating women.",
