        "Authors": "By McGrath, Michael E.",
        "Description": "Product strategy is the most important determinant of success for high-technology companies. It defines the products on which a company bases its business and shapes the way those products will win or lose against the competition. Yet even in high-technology companies, very few executives understand how to conceive and shape successful product strategy.Product Strategy for High-Technology Companies shows how to formulate product strategies that lead to successful products. This comprehensive guide covers everything high-tech companies should consider in developing their strategies, including timing, technological change, globalization, product differentiation, cost and price, and contingency planning, as well as marketing and financial considerations.Product Strategy for High-Technology Companies offers more than strategic guidance. Through more than 250 examples, you'll discover how product strategy has been used at such companies as Microsoft, IBM, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, and many others. Through their trials, errors, and successes, and through the book's expert insights, you'll have a complete framework for building your own innovative, competitive product strategy.",

Acclaimed author Gus Lee combines these elements into an electrifying novel of legal suspense as several lives hinge on the verdict in one shocking case.Joshua Jin is a deputy district attorney whose life is in crisis and his job in jeopardy. Now he is handed a politically charged Chinatown case involving the rape of a thirteen-year-old girl. The victim refuses to talk. The ex-con charged with the crime was arrested on a hunch. And . . . there is no physical evidence.As an Asian-American prosecutor, Jin is under immense pressure from Chinatown to win a conviction. First, however, he must earn the confidence of his stone-silent client, a distant, troubled teenager who trusts no one. Working against a brilliant, high-priced defense attorney who wants nothing more than to crush the opposition--particularly when her opposition is Josh Jin--he throws his heart and soul into an impossible case that is far more explosive than he had ever imagined.A stunning courtroom drama pulsing with the rhythm of the streets and the politics of the Asian-American experience, No Physical Evidence is fast, furious, and surprising: a passionate novel of crime, punishment, and ultimate redemption.",

        "Title": "In Love With Night: The American Romance With Robert Kennedy",
        "Authors": "By Steel, Ronald",
        "Description": "More than three decades have passed since Robert Kennedy was assassinated seeking the Democratic nomination for the presidency. During that time a powerful legend has grown around him. It decrees that he would have quickly ended the Vietnam War, violence in the cities, and racial and social injustice across the land. Millions of Americans continue to believe that legend. For them the yearning for Kennedy is an unhealed wound.  But would he have done what so many wanted from him? Is the Robert Kennedy legend just that -- a legend based more on hope and longing than on reality? This is the question that continues to haunt American politics.  Drawing on his striking interpretation of Kennedy's character, award-winning historian Ronald Steel examines the life against the legend. It is that legend -- one that Kennedy consciously helped create -- that has made him the vessel of the nation's frustrated dreams. Those dreams have created the enduring myth of \"what might have been.\"  Why was a man who began his career as a dark enforcer of his family's ambition ultimately mourned as a secular saint who could have transformed America? How did he build a mythology that made him the heir apparent to his brother's unfulfilled presidency? Were there, in fact, two Bobbys: an early and a late one, a good and a bad one?  With empathy, yet with skepticism, Steel holds up to scrutiny the three central elements of the Kennedy legend: the faith in a golden kingdom of Camelot that could be restored, the belief that he would have achieved the goals that liberals sought, and the hope that he would have united blacks and whites in common endeavor.  What we mourn, Steel concludes, is not so much what Kennedy would have done, or \"what might have been,\" but our own hopes for political deliverance. That is the power, and also the problem, of the Bobby Myth. Yet \"myths can inspire, or they can imprison,\" Steel writes. \"The Bobby Myth,\" he shows in this penetrating study of personality and politics, \"is our creation, not",

        "Description": "In the relatively short span of 25 years \u2014 from his first national campaign in 1920 to his death in the first year of his fourth term as President in 1945 \u2014 Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered hundreds of speeches, many of them masterly orations.Perhaps the finest speechmaker in American history, FDR was a consummate expert at reading his audience. He could be dazzlingly informal, imperiously statesmanlike, witheringly sarcastic, stern, and serious, and when the occasion permitted, outright funny. Though his audiences often included more than 30 million listeners in America and millions more around the world, he succeeded in doing what so many speakers strive for and so few accomplish \u2014 he left his listeners with the feeling that he was speaking to them alone.This representative collection of 27 of FDR's finest speeches recalls a number of momentous events in his political career and the life of the nation. Included are his dramatic and inspirational First Inaugural Address (March 4, 1933) in which he told the nation that \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\"; his first \"Fireside Chat\" (March 12, 1933) over the radio; his dramatic War Message to Congress (December 8, 1941) following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (\"a day that will live in infamy\"); his Fourth Inaugural Address (January 20, 1945); and many more.Assembled here in one convenient volume, these speeches provide students of history, politics, and rhetoric, as well as general readers, with an immensely useful reference, a wealth of fine oration, and a valuable window on the Roosevelt years.",

        "Authors": "By Reingold, Jennifer and Reingold, Dan",
        "Description": "Here is the true story of a top Wall Street player's transformation from a straight-arrow believer to a jaded cynic, who reveals how Wall Street's insider game is really played.Dan Reingold was a top Wall Street analyst for fourteen years and Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman's chief competitor in the red-hot sector of telecom. Reingold was part of the \"Street\" and believed in it.But in this action-packed, highly personal memoir written with accomplished Fast Company senior writer Jennifer Reingold the author describes how his enthusiasm gave way to disgust as he learned how deeply corrupted Wall Street and much of corporate America had become during the roaring stock market bubble of the 1990s.Confessions of a Wall Street Analyst provides a front-row seat at one of the most dramatic -- and ultimately tragic -- periods in financial history. Reingold recounts his introduction to the world of Wall Street leaks and secret deal-making; his experiences with corporate fraud; and Wall Street's alarming penchant for lavish spending and multimillion-dollar pay packages.Reingold spars with arch rival Grubman; fends off intense pressures from Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs; and is wooed by Morgan Stanley's CEO, John Mack, and CSFB's \u00fcber-banker Frank Quattrone.Reingold describes instances in which confidential deals are whispered days before their official announcement.  He recalls the moment he learns that Bernie Ebbers's WorldCom was massively cooking its books. And he is shocked to have been an unwitting catalyst for a series of sexually explicit e-mails that would rock Wall Street; bring Jack Grubman to his knees; and contribute to the stepping aside of Grubman's boss, Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill.Some of Reingold's stories are outrageous, others hilarious, and many are simply absurd. But, together, they provide a sobering expos\u00e9 of Wall Street: a jungle of greed and ego, a place brimming with conflicts and inside information, and a business absurdly out of touch with the Main Street it claims to serve.He shows how government investigators, headlines notwithstanding, never got to the heart of the ethical and legal transgressions of the era. And how they completely overlooked Wall Street's pervasive use of inside information, leaving investors -- even sophisticated professionals -- cheated. The book ends with a series of important policy recommendations to clean up the investing business.In the tradition of Liar's Poker and Den of Thieves, Confessions of a Wall Street Analyst is a no-holds-barred insider's account that will open the eyes of every investor.",

        "Description": "\"I'm not alone. I am part of a generation of fragmented Jews. We're in a kind of limbo. We're suspended between young adulthood and middle age, between Judaism and atheism, between a desire to believe in religion and a personal history of skepticism. Call us a bunch of searchers. Call us post-Holocaust Jews. Call us Generation J.\"Generation J is the ambivalent generation: unaffiliated seekers, men and women who have grown up questioning the bounds of organized religion. Lisa Schiffman is one of these seekers, and Generation J chronicles her journey through the contradictory landscape of Jewish identity. Moving from the personal to the universal, from autobiography to anthropology, from laughter to tears, Schiffman shows us the many ways in which one can be religious.Whether dipping into a ritual bath, getting henna-tattooed with the Star of David, unravelling the mysteries of the kabbalah, or confronting what Jewish tradition has to say about gay marriage, Schiffman reveals the conflicts of meaning and connection common to all who try to chart their own spiritual path. And, through it all, with humor and sensitivity, she confronts the reasons for her own quest and begins to untangle some of the thorniest questions about identity, community, and religion in America today. This engaging exploration of what it means to be Jewish is every bit as much a fascinating tour of the varieties of contemporary Jewish practice as it is an unusual personal quest. Smart, funny, and provocative, Schiffman brilliantly explores the problems and possibilities facing any spiritual seeker today.",

With lucidity and elegance, Zukav explains that we are evolving from a species that pursues power based upon the perceptions of the five senses -- external power -- into a species that pursues authentic power -- power that is based upon the perceptions and values of the spirit. He shows how the pursuit of external power has produced our survival-of-the-fittest understanding of evolution, generated conflict between lovers, communities, and superpowers, and brought us to the edge of destruction.  Using his scientist's eye and philosopher's heart, Zukav shows how infusing the activities of life with reverence, compassion, and trust makes them come alive with meaning and purpose. He illustrates how the emerging values of the spirit are changing marriages into spiritual partnerships, psychology into spiritual psychology, and transforming our everyday lives. The Seat of the Soul describes the remarkable journey to the spirit that each of us is on.",

The chief lesson he learned from all this was to refrain from judgment, a quality he maintained in his other life.For alongside his work as a lawyer, Mortimer indulged a passion for writing. As this second career took over his life, it brought enriching yet frequently volatile friendships: with Tony Richardson, John Gielgud, Harold Pinter, David Niven, and Neil Kinnock, among others, from the worlds of theater, film, the law, and politics. John Mortimer brought his two worlds together in the character of Rumpole, for whom his creator is frequently mistaken.Murderers and Other Friends is John Mortimer's summing up of himself through his friends. With wit, wisdom, and tenderness he has written the story of the second part of his life, of the strangely assorted characters that enriched it, and of his family at its heart.",

        "Description": "Challenging  prevailing media stereotypes, Generation at the Crossroads explores the  beliefs and choices of the students who came of age in the 1980s and  1990s. For seven years, at over a hundred campuses in thirty states,  Paul Loeb asked students about the values they held. He examines their  concepts of responsibility, the links they draw between present and  future, and how they view themselves in relation to the larger human  community in which they live.  He brings us a range of voices, from \"I'm  not that kind of person,\" to \"I had to take a stand.\"  Loeb looks at  how the rest of us can serve young people as better role models, and  give them courage and vision to help build a better world.This  insightful book explores the culture of withdrawal that dominated  American campuses through most of the eighties. He locates its roots in  historical ignorance, relentless individualism, mistrust of social  movements, and a general isolation from urgent realities. He examines  why a steadily increasing minority has begun to take on critical public  issues, whether environmental activism, apartheid, hunger and  homelessness, affordable education, or racial and sexual equity. Loeb  looks at individuals who have overcome precisely the barriers he has  described, and how their journeys can become models. The generational  choices he explores will shape our common future.",

        "Title": "Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century",
        "Authors": "By Garfinkel, Simson",
        "Description": "As the 21st century dawns, advances in technology endanger our privacy in ways never before imagined. Direct marketers and retailers track our every purchase; surveillance cameras observe our movements; mobile phones will soon report our location to those who want to track us; government eavesdroppers listen in on private communications; misused medical records turn our bodies and our histories against us; and linked databases assemble detailed consumer profiles used to predict and influence our behavior. Privacy -- the most basic of our civil rights -- is in grave peril.Simson Garfinkel -- journalist, entrepreneur, and international authority on computer security -- has spent his career testing new technologies and warning about their implications. Database Nation is his compelling account of how invasive technologies will affect our lives in the coming years. It's a timely, far-reaching, entertaining, and thought-provoking look at the serious threats to privacy facing us today. The book poses a disturbing question: how can we protect our basic rights to privacy, identity, and autonomy when technology is making invasion and control easier than ever before?Garfinkel's captivating blend of journalism, storytelling, and futurism is a call to arms. It will frighten, entertain, and ultimately convince us that we must take action now to protect our privacy and identity before it's too late.Background:Fifty years ago, in1984, George Orwell imagined a future in which privacy was demolished by a totalitarian state that used spies, video surveillance, historical revisionism, and control over the media to maintain its power. Those who worry about personal privacy and identity--especially in this day of technologies that encroach upon these rights-- still use Orwell's \"Big Brother\" language to discuss privacy issues. But the reality is that the age of a monolithic Big Brother is over. And yet the threats are perhaps even more likely to destroy the rights we've assumed were ours.Today's threats to privacy are more widely distributed than they were in Orwell's state, and they represent both public and private interests. Over the next fifty years, we'll see new kinds of threats to privacy that don't find their roots in totalitarianism but in capitalism, the free market, advances in technology, and the unbridled exchange of electronic information.Today's Threats to PrivacyThe End of Due Process. Governments and businesses went on a computer-buying spree in the second half of the 20th century, replacing billions of paper files with electronic data-processing systems. But the new computers lacked some very important qualities of the manual systems that they replaced: flexibility, compassion, and understanding. Today, humans often are completely absent from digital decision-making. As a result, we've created a world in which the smallest clerical errors can have devastating effects on a person's life. It's a world where comput- ers are assumed to be correct, and people wrong.The Fallibility of Biometrics. Fingerprints, iris scans, and genetic sequences are widely regarded as infallible techniques for identifying human beings. They are so good, in fact, that fifty years from now identification cards and passports will probably not exist. Instead, a global data network will allow anyone on the planet to be instantly identified from the unique markings of their own body. Will it be impossible for people to conceal their identity from the federal government, and if so, is that a good thing? What about concealing your identity from the local drug store? And who controls the databank, anyway? Would they ever need to create \"false\" identities?The Systematic Capture of Everyday Events. We are entering a new world in which every purchase we make, every place we travel, every word we say, and everything we read is routinely recorded and made available for later analysis. But while the technology exists to capture th",
