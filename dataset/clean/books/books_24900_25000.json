        "Description": "After the collapse of her parents\u2019 marriage, Mimi Schulman leaves her mother in Houston to look after her befuddled photographer father in New York. Too preoccupied with family problems to think much about her new life, Mimi\u2019s first hour at The Baldwin School\u2014an institution where teachers offer psychoanalysis in lieu of grades and students hold cocktail parties in the bathroom between classes\u2014leaves her spinning. When Sam, her childhood best friend, bets her she can\u2019t befriend the \u201ccool girls,\u201d Mimi accepts the challenge, only to discover that social climbing in New York is no easy task. Fitting in with the blond, all-American popular girls back in Texas was nothing compared to joining Baldwin\u2019s clique of raccoon-eyed waifs. Rubbing shoulders with the offspring of diplomats and celebrities, all with secrets and dysfunctions that put her own domestic worries to shame, Mimi finds herself in one bizarre situation to the next\u2014a fake-ID deli, a topless bar, a jacuzzi in Trump Tower\u2014and in the position of winning a bet that threatens to make her lose sight of herself. A coming-of-age story about friendship and betrayal, about brutal honesty and its consequences, The Rise and Fall of a 10th-Grade Social Climber is a novel with heart and a wicked sense of humor.",

Her\u00a0\u00a0World War I veteran father, Pat, wanted his son to\u00a0\u00a0be a pilot, not his reckless, red-haired\u00a0\u00a0daughter. But it was Cassie who had the gift. Ever since\u00a0\u00a0she could remember, Cassie felt the pull of\u00a0\u00a0getting in a cockpit and taking to the skies.\u00a0\u00a0Observing all the while was her father's junior partner,\u00a0\u00a0Nick \"Stick \" Galvin, a fellow war ace\u00a0\u00a0and airborne daredevil. Nick would become her\u00a0\u00a0confidant and best friend, willing to break all the\u00a0\u00a0rules to teach her to fly, knowing that the\u00a0\u00a0greatest gift he could give her was the freedom of\u00a0\u00a0flying. When California entrepreneur Desmon Williams\u00a0\u00a0sees Cassie in a local airshow, he invites her to\u00a0\u00a0California where she breaks new ground as a test\u00a0\u00a0pilot. Soon Cassie's record-breaking flights make\u00a0\u00a0her a media darling. Drawn by Desmond's plans for\u00a0\u00a0her to break Amelia Earhardt's records, but\u00a0\u00a0determined to avoid her mistakes, Cassie trains for\u00a0\u00a0the remarkable journey around the world. From\u00a0\u00a0public appearances to press conferences, easily used\u00a0\u00a0by both her husband and the press, Cassie realizes\u00a0\u00a0that there is more to life than making headlines.\u00a0\u00a0Risking her life, pushing herself to her limits,\u00a0\u00a0she decides to chart her own course and pursue\u00a0\u00a0her own destiny, whatever it costs her. Wings is set in a time of constant change,\u00a0\u00a0when the world was on the brink of war and the\u00a0\u00a0skies were filled with adventurers, a time when\u00a0\u00a0courage and daring forever changed modern-day\u00a0\u00a0aviation.",

He's the heavyweight champion, the All-American quarterback, the four-legged Michael Jordan of the barn. Seabiscuit was once Tom Smith's \"big horse.\" A generation ago, Secretariat was Lucien Lauren's. In 2003, Funny Cide was Barclay Tagg's. In sixty years as a trainer, P. G. Johnson had never had one -- until Volponi.  P. G. Johnson was a blue-collar wizard, a hardscrabble tough guy who had come east from Chicago, determined to make his mark on New York. And he did. He became leading trainer at all three New York tracks -- Saratoga, Belmont, and Aqueduct -- as well as at Florida's Tropical Park. And he did it without ever winning a Triple Crown or Breeders' Cup event, or having \"the big horse.\"  \"I never knew how to kiss rich people's asses, and I got too old to learn. If no owner was going to give me a big horse, I figured I'd have to find one myself,\" he said. He did that, in his seventies, buying a mare for $8,000, breeding her to a $20,000 stallion, and in 1998 producing Volponi, the horse that would change his life.  In October 2002, weakened by surgery and radiation treatment for cancer, P. G. watched Volponi -- the longest shot in the field at 43 to 1 -- bring home more than $2 million by winning the Breeders' Cup Classic, the richest race in America.  The following summer at Saratoga, McGinniss -- journalist, investigative reporter, and horse racing obsessive -- began showing up, more Tuesdays with Morrie than Guys and Dolls, at P. G.'s barn in the predawn hours to listen to the inside racing stories and lore P. G. had gathered. McGinniss came to appreciate that Johnson was not only a stellar horseman but an American original whose wit and wisdom carried far beyond the confines of the racetrack.  As for Volponi, the big horse had given P. G. the perfect Disney ending with the Breeders' Cup victory, and, indeed, Disney soon bought film rights to P. G.'s life story. \"He'll be even better next year,\" P. G. had said, but by the time McGinniss got to Saratoga, Volponi had not won a race in nine months. His faith undiminished, P. G. continued to race Volponi against the best, at Saratoga and beyond, until in the end it came down to the 2003 Breeders' Cup Classic in Santa Anita, a race only one horse in history had ever won twice. As fires burned in the Southern California hills, Volponi -- with Funny Cide's jockey, Jose Santos, in the saddle -- ran the last race of his life.  This book is about what happened that day, about what came after, and about much of what had come before. It's the most exciting, rewarding, and heartwarming story about the world of horse racing that you'll ever read, by one of America's finest writers, at the top of his form.  \"The big horse,\" in racing vernacular, is the animal that brings fame and fortune to a stable.

Republicans and conservatives would welcome a responsible opposition party to keep them sharp and to debate the crucial issues facing our country--but the Democrats aren't it. In sobering detail, commentator Limbaugh shows why, and highlights the dangers of what a Democratic resurgence could mean for America. He lays bare the gamut of Democratic moral and intellectual bankruptcy--from liberal activist judges who want to rewrite the Constitution, to left-wing moral relativists who want to overturn traditional morality in the name of liberal \"values,\" to unrepentant left-wing racism, to economic ideas that are no more than tired class warfare.--From publisher description.",

        "Description": "\"In the beginning we were happy. And we were always excessive. So in the beginning we were happy to excess.\" With these opening lines Sean Wilsey takes us on an exhilarating tour of life in the strangest, wealthiest, and most grandiose of families.  Sean's blond-bombshell mother (one of the thinly veiled characters in Armistead Maupin's bestselling Tales of the City) is a 1980s society-page staple, regularly entertaining Black Panthers and movie stars in her marble and glass penthouse, \"eight hundred feet in the air above San Francisco; an apartment at the top of a building at the top of a hill: full of light, full of voices, full of windows full of water and bridges and hills.\" His enigmatic father uses a jet helicopter to drop Sean off at the video arcade and lectures his son on proper hygiene in public restrooms, \"You should wash your hands first, before you use the urinal. Not after. Your penis isn't dirty. But your hands are.\"  When Sean, \"the kind of child who sings songs to sick flowers,\" turns nine years old, his father divorces his mother and marries her best friend. Sean's life blows apart. His mother first invites him to commit suicide with her, then has a \"vision\" of salvation that requires packing her Louis Vuitton luggage and traveling the globe, a retinue of multiracial children in tow. Her goal: peace on earth (and a Nobel Prize). Sean meets Indira Gandhi, Helmut Kohl, Menachem Begin, and the pope, hoping each one might come back to San Francisco and persuade his father to rejoin the family. Instead, Sean is pushed out of San Francisco and sent spiraling through five high schools, till he finally lands at an unorthodox reform school cum \"therapeutic community,\" in Italy.  With its multiplicity of settings and kaleidoscopic mix of preoccupations-sex, Russia, jet helicopters, seismic upheaval, boarding schools, Middle Earth, skinheads, home improvement, suicide, skateboarding, Sovietology, public transportation, massage, Christian fundamentalism, dogs, Texas, global thermonuclear war, truth, evil, masturbation, hope, Bethlehem, CT, eventual salvation (abridged list)-Oh the Glory of It All is memoir as bildungsroman as explosion.",

        "Description": "Beginning with a savage killing at a suburban Virginia juvenile detention center, Nathan's Run hurtles its diminutive protagonist, twelve-year-old Nathan Bailey, through a terrifying gauntlet. Accused of murder and branded a cop killer, Nathan becomes the target of a nationwide manhunt even as a vicious hit man is closing in on him. Orphaned and alone, Nathan has nowhere to turn for help.To stay alive he can count only on himself: on his agility, natural cleverness, and honesty. Ironically, the latter proves a formidable weapon as the boy endears himself to a national radio talk-show host and, along the way, pleads his case to a rapt nation.Still, \"justice\" will not be denied, and as an army of police and a dogged contract killer draw closer, Nathan is tested to the very limits of his endurance.Ultimately it will fall to one heart-scarred cop to hold out the helping hand Nathan so sorely needs.",

When you ask yourself why you are making them, Quindlen encourages you to give this answer: For me. \u201cBecause they are what I want, or wish for. Because they reflect who and what I am. . . . That way lies dancing to the melodies spun out by your own heart.\u201dAt the core of this beautiful book lies the secret of authentic success, the inspiration to embrace your own uniqueness and live the life that is undeniably your own, rich in fulfillment and meaning.",

A young Englishman journeys to Tuscany to rescue his late brother's wife from what appears to be an unsuitable romance with an Italian of little fortune. In the events surrounding that match and its fateful consequences, Forster weaves an exciting and eventful tale that intriguingly contrasts English and Italian lives and sensibilities. As in Forster novels, among them Howards End and A Passage to India, Where Angels Fear to Tread reveals the author's deep fascination with all of human experience \u2014 sexual, moral, spiritual, imaginative, material. Acutely observant of the ways of the English middle class, he is as critical here of its snobbishness, greed, and cultural insensitivity as he is respectful of its decency and kindness, common sense, and goodwill. This splendid novel reveals the great breadth of his gifts as both storyteller and humanist \u2014 attributes that continue to make him one of the twentieth century's most admired novelists.",

Its themes of sin, guilt, and redemption, woven through a story of adultery in the early days of the Massachusetts Colony, are revealed with remarkable psychological penetration and understanding of the human heart. Hester Prynne is the adulteress, forced by the Puritan community to wear a scarlet letter A on the breast of her gown. Arthur Dimmesdale, the minister and the secret father of her child, Pearl, struggles with the agony of conscience and his own weakness. Roger Chillingworth, Hester's husband, revenges himself on Dimmesdale by calculating assaults on the frail mental state of the conscience-stricken cleric. The result is an American tragedy of stark power and emotional depth that has mesmerized critics and readers for nearly a century and a half.A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.",

James Kennedy believes it will be a watershed moment that could impact our very survival as a nation under God.Values voters\u2013people whose political views and votes are based on their faith in God\u2013are being targeted as never before. As we move forward in the campaign season, the significant players will debate terrorism, radical Islam, nuclear threats, global warming, social issues, gay marriage, immigration, education, health care, and many other essential issues that can create sharp ideological divisions.

How Would Jesus Vote? isn\u2019t intended to tell you which candidates to support; rather it offers you a Christ-centered understanding of the world to help you draw your own political conclusions. This election, don\u2019t cast an uninformed vote that fails to reflect your values. Instead, learn how to apply your faith and obedience to God to your ballot.

        "Authors": "By Barker, Teresa and Rich, Harvey L.",
        "Description": "In this enlightening work, popular psychoanalyst Harvey Rich offers a philosophy for living that transforms the flow of everyday moments into a celebrated life. Most of us recognize celebration as an event, but as Rich describes it, celebration is much deeper; it is the internal experience of ourselves in the moment that leaves a long-lasting imprint on our psyche. Whether we are experiencing the beauty of a sunset, the pain of loss, the chemistry of love, the sting of harsh words, soul-crushing boredom, or the thrill of accomplishment, what we learn when we fully engage ourselves in the experience of a moment can affect us forever.Rich describes a celebratory process that unfolds when we recognize a moment as special, and open ourselves to the fullest sensory experience of it. In this deliberate engagement we enrich our understanding of ourselves and our lives in the context of family, friendship, love relationships, and work. Celebration carries us through the joys and adversities of life, and connects us to our spiritual center.Drawing upon his own life experience, family history, and his training in theology, art, literature, medicine, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis, Rich shows us how we can capture the moments of our lives and bring our own histories and aspirations to bear upon those moments -- a celebration that is the antidote to the blur of our often high-tech, fast-paced lives.Celebrating the daily moments of our lives serves as a means of including ourselves in the fullest experience of life -- our profound inner life, our spiritual dimension, the life of our culture, and the history of humankind.",
