        "Description": "Heather Peters is a blond dynamo and the most acquisitive and materialistic woman you may ever meet. Along with her husband, Kevin, and eight-year-old son, Connor, she moves to Galapagos Estates, a new housing development situated just where the New Jersey suburbs meet the countryside. All Heather wants is a nice house. Well, a nice house and a nice piece of land. And, of course, a basement gym, a master bath with radiant heat, Jacuzzi, and his-and-her toilets. She could make do without a media room if she had to. After all, the pioneers didn't have plasma TV, and they survived.The action begins when Heather and Harlan, a local egg farmer who works as a sometimes handyman, are setting up her patio for a tea party. Harlan's lived in town all of his life, and while he is contemptuous of the new McMansions and their inhabitants, he's found he can make money from them. When a timber rattlesnake comes out of the grass, Heather shrieks at him to kill it. Harlan knows that these snakes are endangered, but she is kicking up such a fuss (screaming bloody murder while standing on top of her new garden furniture) that he goes ahead and does it.What neither realizes is that these snakes are being tracked by a local animal rights group and that it's a crime to kill them in the state of New Jersey. They also don't know that Galapagos Estates was illegally built on a rattlesnake habitat by a shady developer who fudged the environmental report. The dead snake is traced to Heather, who is hauled out of back-to-school night and into a jail cell. When an ambitious local reporter tells her story, Heather basks in the resulting media circus. but things get ugly when the animal rights group \"liberates\" fifteen hundred lab rats at Heather's house and the residents of Galapagos Estates band together to force the Peterses to move. But don't count her out yet - Heather doesn't get mad, she gets even.",

        "Description": "\"When you are a great-grandfather, you will experience something so much more powerful and meaningful than being a father or a grandfather that you will look at the march of generations with new eyes.\" -- from Letter to a Great Grandson   In this heartwarming book -- written for his great-grandson but perfect for readers of all ages -- a beloved commentator and trusted public figure shares his thoughts on topics ranging from relationships to science to life in general.  When his great-grandson Alexander was born in 2002, Hugh Downs suddenly gained a rare perspective on the world from seeing American culture evolve through five generations (his parents', his own, his children's, his grandchildren's, and now his great-grandson's). Once Downs realized the extraordinary amount of love he felt for his brand-new descendant and the profound connection he sensed between them, he decided to write a letter to be read at the different stages of Alexander's life.  Letter to a Great Grandson is thoughtful and touching, funny and wise. With his trademark insight, Downs discusses the joys, possibilities, and challenges of infancy, young adulthood, middle age, old age, and everything in between. Divided into eleven chronological decades of life, it describes the common problems, achievements, and expectations of each stage. Throughout, Downs offers his characteristically erudite thoughts on myriad subjects, as well as delightful anecdotes from his own life.  A celebration of the remarkable bond between grandparents and their grandchildren (and great-grandparents and their great-grandchildren), this special book emphasizes the importance of maintaining that most precious possession -- family connections. It will resonate personally with each reading and in each new phase of life, and is a wonderful gift to be treasured for generations.",

But Walter Wangerin side-steps such easy answers and offers us instead an intimate portrait of his own courtship and thirty-two year marriage-and a pastoral view of married life that inspires readers to view their own marriages with new honesty and hope. Wangerin's six tasks of marriage encourages couples to better understand and happily live out the vows they made, giving them tools to nurture and maintain a strong marital relationship. In his endorsement, Philip Yancey accurately describes this book as \"an enduring classic and a book of wisdom, beauty, compassion, and piercing honesty.\"",

        "Description": "I don't know if people will ever be able to talk to animals the way Doctor Doolittle could, or whether animals will be able to talk back. Maybe science will have something to say about that. But I do know people can learn to \"talk\" to animals, and to hear what animals have to say, better than they do now. --From Animals in TranslationWhy would a cow lick a tractor? Why are collies getting dumber? Why do dolphins sometimes kill for fun? How can a parrot learn to spell? How did wolves teach man to evolve? Temple Grandin draws upon a long, distinguished career as an animal scientist and her own experiences with autism to deliver an extraordinary message about how animals act, think, and feel. She has a perspective like that of no other expert in the field, which allows her to offer unparalleled observations and groundbreaking ideas. People with autism can often think the way animals think, putting them in the perfect position to translate \"animal talk.\" Grandin is a faithful guide into their world, exploring animal pain, fear, aggression, love, friendship, communication, learning, and, yes, even animal genius. The sweep of Animals in Translation is immense and will forever change the way we think about animals. *includes a Behavior and Training Troubleshooting Guide\u00a0Among its provocative ideas, the book: argues that language is not a requirement for consciousness--and that animals do have consciousness applies the autism theory of \"hyper-specificity\" to animals, showing that animals and autistic people are so sensitive to detail that they \"can't see the forest for the trees\"--a talent as well as a \"deficit\" explores the \"interpreter\" in the normal human brain that filters out detail, leaving people blind to much of the reality that surrounds them--a reality animals and autistic people see, sometimes all too clearlyexplains how animals have \"superhuman\" skills: animals have animal geniuscompares animals to autistic savants, declaring that animals may in fact be autistic savants, with special forms of genius that normal people do not possess and sometimes cannot even see examines how humans and animals use their emotions to think, to decide, and even to predict the future\u00a0reveals the remarkable abilities of handicapped people and animals\u00a0maintains that the single worst thing you can do to an animal is to make it feel afraid",

Among his findings: militant Islam has much in common with fascism and communism; about one in every eight Muslims worldwide supports militant Islam; 70,000 Al-Qaeda accomplices remain at large in over fifty countries; Michael Jackson and Madonna are, in the eyes of militant Islam, \"cultural terrorists\" who should be brought to trial; militant Islamic groups have raised $1.3 million for the defense of indicted murder suspect Jamil Al-Amin (formerly H. Rap Brown). Militant Islam Reaches America is one of the important and readable books about the grave issues that now confront America.",

Drafted by Thomas Jefferson, the Declaration set forth the terms of a new form of government with the following words: \"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\"Framed in 1787 and in effect since March 1789, the Constitution of the United States of America fulfilled the promise of the Declaration by establishing a republican form of government with separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, became part of the Constitution on December 15, 1791. Among the rights guaranteed by these amendments are freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and the right to trial by jury. Written so that it could be adapted to endure for years to come, the Constitution has been amended only seventeen times since 1791 and has lasted longer than any other written form of government.",
