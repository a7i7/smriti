And when his Oprah appearance shot the book onto the New York Times bestseller list, he kept the heat on. We can expect the same tenacious commitment to promoting his follow-up book, The Excellent 11. The Excellent 11 contains eleven sections, with each one focusing on a theme directly related to teaching and raising children. Ron Clark draws from his own experience to give advice, telling personal stories that demonstrate the significance of each theme within the learning environment--an environment that extends beyond the classroom and into the larger world. Using themes ranging from Adventure, Ingenuity, and Humor to Dedication, Creativity, and Love, Clark provides a road map for both parents and teachers who want to enrich their children's learning experiences.",

        "Title": "Over the Hills: A Midlife Escape Across America by Bicycle",
        "Authors": "By Lamb, David",
        "Description": "David Lamb gave himself - for this book - a fifty-fourth birthday present: a trip across America at ten miles per hour. The genesis of this notion occurred one afternoon when Lamb was seated at the bar of the Antlers Saloon in Wisdom, Montana. There was a hitching post outside and against it were two jet-black touring bicycles with stuffed panniers balanced over the rear wheels. The owners were a couple from Chicago on a biking vacation that would take them from Fargo, North Dakota, to Missoula, Montana. Lamb quizzed them as surely as he would have a wagonmaster headed west. It had never occurred to him that people actually traveled so far by bicycle, and the idea struck him as a captivating one, a kind of return to past times when to travel meant to experience an intimacy with the towns and valleys and mountains one crossed through or over.Lamb began his own journey on a sleek 21-speed touring bicycle, which would carry him 3,145 miles from his home in Alexandria, Virginia, all the way to the pier poking out into the Pacific Ocean in Santa Monica, California. He did no training for this feat, failed to curb his addictions to cigarettes and junk food, and along the way encountered an America all but invisible to those unfortunate travelers held hostage by the interstate. The journey took two months, and Over the Hills is the magnificent result: a literary travelogue, fun and celebratory, a story about people met and physical challenges overcome.",

        "Description": "Psychologist and mother Madeline Levine looks at the history of television and movie violence in the United States. She translates into everyday language the results of over four decades of research on the effects of media violence - research that up until now has been inaccessible to most parents. Using a \"developmental approach,\" Dr. Levine helps parents understand that children at different ages think about, understand, and experience the world in very different ways. An appreciation of these differences in how children \"see\" things is critical if parents are to make wise choices about what is appropriate and what is potentially harmful to their children. Using research findings, common sense, and personal experience, Dr. Levine demonstrates that violence is not generic - and neither are children: the movie that may be instructive and appropriate for an eleven-year-old may be traumatic and overwhelming for a seven-year-old. Parents frequently underestimate the impact of violent television on their children and may be surprised at what children find upsetting.Dr. Levine argues that the issue of media violence is not trivial, that our society is increasingly at risk not only for higher levels of violence but for a greater tolerance and acceptance of this violence. In spite of efforts from both sides of the political spectrum to claim media violence as a political issue, Dr. Levine insists this is a parenting and citizenship issue. She looks at how parents, government, schools, and the media itself can best approach the problem. The book concludes with a list of resources to help parents become active in media reform.",

        "Description": "Born on a Blue Day is a journey into one of the most fascinating minds alive today -- guided by its owner himself. Daniel Tammet sees numbers as shapes, colors, and textures, and he can perform extraordinary calculations in his head. He can learn to speak new languages fluently, from scratch, in a week. In 2004, he memorized and recited more than 22,000 digits of pi, setting a record. He has savant syndrome, an extremely rare condition that gives him almost unimaginable mental powers, much like those portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the film Rain Man.Daniel has a compulsive need for order and routine -- he eats the same precise amount of cereal for breakfast every morning and cannot leave the house without counting the number of items of clothing he's wearing. When he gets stressed or is unhappy, he closes his eyes and counts. But in one crucial way Daniel is not at all like the Rain Man: he is virtually unique among people who have sev- ere autistic disorders in that he is capable of living a fully independent life. He has emerged from the \"other side\" of autism with the ability to function successfully -- he is even able to explain what is happening inside his head.Born on a Blue Day is a triumphant and uplifting story, starting from early childhood, when Daniel was incapable of making friends and prone to tantrums, to young adulthood, when he learned how to control himself and to live independently, fell in love, experienced a religious conversion to Christianity, and most recently, emerged as a celebrity. The world's leading neuroscientists have been studying Daniel's ability to solve complicated math problems in one fell swoop by seeing shapes rather than making step-by-step calculations. Here he explains how he does it, and how he is able to learn new languages so quickly, simply by absorbing their patterns. Fascinating and inspiring, Born on a Blue Day explores what it's like to be special and gives us an insight into what makes us all human -- our minds.",

By following the teaching in this book, you can make a decision today to keep conflict out of your life; out of your thoughts, words, and attitudes; and out of your relationships. Choose life!

Most women (if they\u2019re honest) see the selfishness of Sapphira or the deception of Delilah. They catch of glimpse of Jezebel\u2019s take-charge pride or Eve\u2019s disastrous disobedience. Like Bathsheba, Herodias, and the rest, today\u2019s modern woman is surrounded by temptations, exhausted by the demands of daily living, and burdened by her own desires.So what\u2019s a good girl to do? Learn from their lives, says beloved humor writer Liz Curtis Higgs, and by God\u2019s grace, choose a better path. InBad Girls of the Bible, Higgs offers a unique and clear-sighted approach to understanding those \u201cother women\u201d in Scripture, combining a contemporary retelling of their stories with a solid, verse-by-verse study of their mistakes and what lessons women today can learn from them.Whether they were \u201cBad to the Bone,\u201d \u201cBad for a Season, but Not Forever\u201d or only \u201cBad for a Moment,\u201d these infamous sisters show women hownot to handle the challenges of life.

You may have even visited The Lady & Sons to taste for yourself the down-home delicacies that made her famous and even heard some version of her Cinderella story (a single mom with two teenage sons started a brown-bag lunch business with $200 and wound up with a thriving restaurant, a fairy-tale second marriage, and wildly popular television shows), but you have never heard the intimate details of her often bumpy road to fame and fortune.   Courageously honest, downright inspiring, and just a little bit saucy, Paula shares the highs and lows of her life in the inimitable charming and irreverent style that you know from her television shows and personal appearances. She talks about long childhood summers spent in a bathing suit and roller skates and hard years living in the back of her father's gas station; a buzzing high school social life of sleepovers, parties, cheerleading, and boys; and a difficult marriage. The death of her beloved parents precipitated a debilitating agoraphobia that crippled her for years. But even when the going got tough, Paula never lost the good grace and sense of humor that would eventually help carry her to success and stardom. Of course, you can't get by on charm alone: as Paula has learned, you need plenty of willpower, hard work, and, above all, the love and support of family and friends to finance, sustain, and run a successful restaurant.   In each chapter, Paula shares new recipes: there's serious comfort food like her momma's Chocolate-Dippy Doughnuts, Courage Chili for when you know life's going to get tough, Sexy Oxtails for seducing that special someone, and the recipe for her new mother-in-law's Banana Nut Delight Cake that Paula finally got just right. And you'll love the never-before-seen photos of her family.   In this memoir, Paula Deen speaks as frankly and intimately as few women in the public eye have ever dared. Whether she's telling tales of good times or bad, her story is proof that the old-fashioned American dream is alive and kicking, and there still is such a thing as a real-life happy ending.",

        "Title": "Morgan's Run",
        "Authors": "By McCullough, Colleen",
        "Description": "In a novel of sweeping narrative power unequaled since her own beloved worldwide bestseller The Thorn Birds, Colleen McCullough returns to Australia -- this time with the story of its birth. At the center of her new novel is Richard Morgan, son of a Bristol tavern-keeper, devoted husband and loving father, sober and hardworking craftsman. By the machinations of fate and the vagaries of the 18th-century English judicial system, he is consigned as a convict to the famous \"First Fleet,\" which set sail, bearing, as an experiment in penology, 582 male and 193 female felons sentenced to transportation, in May of 1787 for the continent that Captain Cook had discovered only a few years earlier. The word \"epic\" is overused, but no other word can do justice to one of the most grueling and significant voyages in human history or to the courage of the convicts whose sufferings were not ended but had only just begun when they set foot on Australian soil at Botany Bay on January 19th, 1788. Of those convicts, Richard Morgan stood out, not only for his strength and his calm determination to let no man bully him, but also for his intelligence, his fair-mindedness, his common sense, and his willingness to help others. To these qualities must be added a certain innate dignity that hinted, even in the most terrible conditions, at a life marked by tragedies that would have broken most men.  In Richard Morgan, Colleen McCullough has created one of her most compelling characters. We see through Morgan's eyes the two worlds in which the story takes place: that of 18th-century Bristol, where Morgan was born and expected to live out his life, and that of a convicted felon sent to settle a hostile new world.  When the book begins, Richard Morgan is a contented man -- happily married, with a child he adores. Then, piece by piece, his idyll crumbles until he finds himself led into an ambiguous relationship with a beautiful young woman, whose dissolute protector seeks vengeance on Morgan to protect his own skin.  He endures the agonies of bereavement and financial loss, incarceration in prison and aboard the notorious \"hulks,\" then the horrors of the journeys to Botany Bay and Norfolk Island, where he finds against all odds a new love and a new life.  Richard Morgan's story is true, but in making Morgan the central figure of her novel, Colleen McCullough has created a hero whom no reader will ever forget; she has written not only a great adventure and a powerful love story, but also a book that combines the elements of Tom Jones and  Mutiny on the Bounty.  Morgan's Run is great fiction, full of drama, passion, history, love, and hatred, full-blooded and totally engrossing, a stunning work that is at once rich entertainment -- and a revelation.",

        "Title": "Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference?",
        "Authors": "By Yancey, Philip",
        "Description": "In his most powerful book since What\u2019s So Amazing About Grace? and The Jesus I Never Knew, Philip Yancey probes the very heartbeat\u2014the most fundamental, challenging, perplexing, and deeply rewarding aspect\u2014of our relationship with God: prayer. What is prayer? How does it work? And more importantly, does it work? In theory, prayer is the essential human act, a priceless point of contact between us and the God of the universe. In practice, prayer is often frustrating, confusing, and fraught with mystery. Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference? is an exploration of the mysterious intersection where God and humans meet and relate. Writing as a fellow pilgrim, Yancey explores such questions as: \u2022Is God listening? \u2022Why should God care about me? \u2022If God knows everything, what\u2019s the point of prayer? \u2022Why do answers to prayer seem so inconsistent and capricious? \u2022Why does God seem sometimes close and sometimes far away? \u2022How can I make prayer more satisfying? \u201cI have found that the most important purpose of prayer may be to let ourselves be loved by God,\u201d says Yancey. Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference? encourages us to pray to God the Father who sees what lies ahead of us, knows what lies within us, and who invites us into an eternal partnership\u2014through prayer.
