        "Authors": "By Solow, Jennifer",
        "Description": "Jillian Siegel is living the quintessential Manhattan life: great clothes, fabulous boyfriend, a job at the hottest ad agency in town. But what nobody knows is that this twenty-nine-year-old has a dark little secret -- one that involves stuffing her oversize Gucci handbag with high-priced designer clothes and leaving the store without paying. There was once a time when Jillian didn't need to shop (much less steal) to feel whole. But that was long ago -- when her beloved uncle Bingo still owned Loevner's, the elegant Upper East Side department store. When, as a little girl, she spent hours listening to the wisdom of the perfume counter ladies and modeling party dresses for her uncle's impish partner, Alain; when she danced beneath Loevner's magnificent chandelier, found solace in the secret passageways behind its grand facade, and when her mother's prolonged absences were easily forgotten with a new camel-hair coat or a fresh pair of Mary Janes. And then one day it was all gone. The department store family, the enchanted world, the endless abundance -- pulled out from under her by her jet-setting mother, Lois; by the father she never knew; by the death of Alain, a cherished friend and confidant; and by the man with two first names who orchestrated the corporate takeover of her family's venerable sanctuary. Now, years later, Jillian cannot seem to make things right no matter how many Chlo\u00e9 blouses come home in her pocketbook. Her \"perfect\" life is loosely held together with half milligrams of Ativan and stolen cashmere scarves. It's only a matter of time until everything crumbles.Penned by one of advertising's most influential and provocative writers, this highly anticipated debut is packed with vibrant characters, bristling dialogue, and the rich detail of the author's real-life research into the clandestine world of shoplifting rings. The Booster is a uniquely stylish, deftly woven story about discovering one's true self in the most unexpected of places.",

        "Description": "Marketing has a greater purpose, and marketers, a higher calling, than simply selling more widgets, according to John Quelch and Katherine Jocz.In Greater Good, the authors contend that marketing performs an essential societal function--and does so democratically. They maintain that people would benefit if the realms of politics and marketing were informed by one another's best principles and practices.Quelch and Jocz lay out the six fundamental characteristics that marketing and democracy share: (1) exchange of value, such as goods, services, and promises, (2) consumption of goods and services, (3) choice in all decisions, (4) free flow of information, (5) active engagement of a majority of individuals, and (6) inclusion of as many people as possible.  Without these six traits, both marketing and democracy would fail, and with them, society.Drawing on current and historical examples from economies around the world, this landmark work illuminates marketing's critical role in the development, growth, and governance of societies. It reveals how good marketing practices improve the political process and--in turn--the practice of democracy itself.",

Using his amazing and inspiring classroom techniques, Esquith has helped thousands of children learn to maximize their potential. In Lighting Their Fires, Esquith shows that children aren't born extraordinary; they become that way as a result of parents and teachers who instill values that serve them not just in school, but for the rest of their lives. Framed by a class trip to a major league baseball game, Lighting Their Fires moves inning by inning through concepts that help children build character and develop enriching lives. Whether he is highlighting the importance of time management or offering a step-by-step discussion of how children can become good decision makers, Esquith shows how parents can equip their kids with all the tools they need to find success and have fun in the process. Using examples from classic films and great books, he stresses the value of sacrifice, the importance of staying true to oneself, and the danger that television can pose to growing young minds. Lighting Their Fires is that rarest of education books: one that explains not just how to make our children great students, but how to make them thoughtful and honorable people.",

        "Description": "\u201cDamage them all you can,\u201d the patrician Lee exhorts, and his Southern army, ragtag in uniform and elite in spirit, responds ferociously in one battle after another against their Northern enemies\u2014from the Seven Days and the Valley Campaign through Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, from the Wilderness to Spotsylvania to the final siege of Richmond and Petersburg. Lee knows that the South\u2019s five-and-a-half million white population will be worn down in any protracted struggle by the North\u2019s twenty-two million. He is ever offensive-minded, ever seeking the victory that will destroy his enemies\u2019 will to fight. He uses his much shorter interior lines to rush troops to trouble spots by forced marches and by rail. His cavalry rides on raids around the entire union army. Lee divides his own force time and again, defying military custom by bluffing one wing of the enemy while striking furiously elsewhere.But this book is more than military history. Walsh\u2019s narrative digs deeper, revealing the humanity of Lee and his lieutenants as never before\u2014their nobility and their flaws, their chilling acceptance of death, their tender relations with wives and sweethearts in the midst of carnage.Here we encounter in depth the men who still stir the imagination. The dutiful Robert E. Lee, haunted by his father\u2019s failures; stern and unbending Stonewall Jackson, cut down at the moment of his greatest triumph; stolid James Longstreet, who came to believe he was Lee\u2019s equal as a strategist, the enigmatic George Pickett.These men and scores of others, enlisted men as well as officers, carry the ultimately tragic story of the Army of Northern Virginia forward with heart rending force and bloody impact. As the war progresses we wonder above all else, had orders been strictly obeyed here or daylight lasted an extra hour there, what might have been. Only Appomattox brings an end to such speculation, when the tattered remnants of Lee\u2019s army, both the still living and the shadowy dead, stack their arms at last.",

        "Description": "Strategy and communications consultant Payne briefly gives advice on how the American progressive movement can build a infrastructure of think-tanks, media, lobby groups, and other organizations and then presents profiles of the types of organizations that currently exist and illustrate this paradigm--organizations such a the community organizing group ACORN, Air America Radio, Brave New Films, Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, the Center for American Progress, the Huffington Post, MoveOn, Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, Vote Vets, and Young Democrats of America, among others. In each profile, a leader or officer of organization in question answers Payne's questions concerning the organization's purpose, its plan to impact the public debate, its plans for growth and change, and advice for fellow progressives.

The Great Fitness Experiment is not a how-to guide but rather a fitness memoir in which Charlotte Hilton Andersen sifts through the morass of contradictory claims and information in today\u2019s health- and fitness-obsessed world. Andersen tries a new workout each month for a year in an attempt to discover what works, what doesn't, and what\u2019s just plain weird. She delves into such subjects as the Action Hero Workout, Cross Fit Training, Going Vegan, Double Cardio, and others. Interspersed between the chapters on the monthly experiments, Andersen offers personal essays on everything from her past experiences with eating disorders to testing the ugliest fitness shoes on the planet to lesson about, as she puts it \"what I\u2019ve learned from being a girl in our body-obsessed culture.\" She writes candidly about her history of anorexia, orthorexia, and \"general-low-self-esteem-exia,\" including anecdotes about the effects of the health craze on her students, friends, and gym buddies.",

Bunch of animals.\" The two police offers responding to a call about an open fire hydrant lash out furiously at the Puerto Rican residents of New York City\u2019s El Barrio neighborhood.  It's the summer of 1941, and all ten-year-old Nilda wants to do is enjoy the cool water with her friends. But the policemen\u2019s curses end their fun, and their animosity is played out over and over again in Nilda\u2019s life.  She is repeatedly treated with contempt and even disgust by adults in positions of authority: teachers, nurses and social workers.  At home, though, she is surrounded by a large and loving\u2014if somewhat eccentric\u2014 family that supports and encourages her artistic abilities. She experiences the onset of World War II and watches anxiously as several brothers go off to war; her stepfather\u2019s poor health means he can\u2019t work, causing serious financial difficulties for the family; one brother slinks off to the underworld, leaving behind a pregnant girlfriend, adding two more mouths to feed to the family\u2019s already dire situation.  Named an \"Outstanding Book of the Year\" by The New York Times and one of the \"Best Books of the Year\" by the American Library Association in 1973 when it was first published, Nicholasa Mohr\u2019s classic novel about life as an immigrant in New York City offers a poignant look at one young girl\u2019s experiences. Issues of race, religion and machismo are realistically and movingly depicted in this groundbreaking coming-of-age novel that was one of the first by a Latina author to be hailed by the mainstream media.",

If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like a fool.\"  This is the golden rule set forth by Dr. Ben Chavis, the highly unorthodox principal of Oakland, California's American Indian Public Charter School, which was hailed as an \"education miracle\" by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger after it was transformed from a failing \"nuisance\" into one of the best public middle schools in the nation.  This is the story of how one man, in daring to be different, effected such stunning change. With his rigorous, no-nonsense approach, Dr. Ben Chavis debunks the myth that poor, minority, inner-city schools have little chance at academic excellence. Focusing on back-to-basics ideals, he has created a structured educational model that, combined with the enthusiasm of his students and teachers, delivers astounding results.  Now, Dr. Chavis recounts how he did it-in his own words and through the stories of the extraordinary young people he's helped.",

Emily Harris didn't belong in the hard life of the Blakes. Beautiful and refined, she was accustomed to the best life had to offer.

Emily wanted to make some sort of mark on the world before marriage. She wanted to be more than just a society wife. Though she had plenty of opportunities back East, she had come to the Idaho high country looking to make a difference.

Desperate, the Army resorts to a contingency paper that proposes to break a subject's resistance by inducing a religious conversion. One hitch: the top-secret attempt must be masked as an offer of clemency, and must rely on a completely innocent mentor, a so-called witness who is unaware of the project's true aims. They find that witness in Greg Cahill, a disgraced FBI agent who has since turned to Christ and serves in a prison ministry. Lured by an offer of restoration, as well as the lifting of a restraining order that's keeping him from seeing his son, Greg begins an unlikely friendship with a man the entire country despises. Despite himself, he begins to share his faith--yet with a combustible result unforeseen by either himself or his government handlers.",
