        "Description": "America discovered A. S. Byatt when Possession, her Booker Prize-winning Victorian novel, was published here in 1990 and became one of the bestselling books of that year. Readers have been waiting ever since for her next full-length novel. Babel Tower is every bit as brilliant and ambitious as its predecessor, but with a more contemporary setting: the 1960s, a decade of turbulence and passionate ideals that Byatt uses to both frame and propel the lives of her characters.At the heart of the novel are two law cases that shape the story: a painful divorce and custody suit, and the prosecution of an \"obscene\" book. Frederica, the independent young heroine, is involved in both, and her personal and legal crises mirror those of the age. This is the decade of The Beatles, the Death of God, and the birth of computer languages. The resulting confusion, charted with a brilliant imaginative sympathy, is as comic as it is threatening and bizarre.",

        "Authors": "By Plato and Jowett, Benjamin",
        "Description": "Among the most influential thinkers in Western history, Plato presented his thought in a series of dramatic dialogues in which different speakers present various aspects of a philosophical problem. This volume contains two of the most interesting and important of these dialogues. The philosophic goal of the Symposium is to find the ultimate manifestation of the love that controls the world, leading to mystic union with eternal and supercosmic beauty. Phaedrus discusses the psychology of love, resulting in the concept of the familiar Platonic \"forms\" as objects of transcendental emotion. In this inexpensive edition of the renowned Jowett translation, they will be welcomed by anyone interested in Greek thought or the philosophy of Plato.",

Wild horses evolved and roamed in North America until becoming extinct ten thousand years ago. Not until the early sixteenth century, when the conquistadors brought tough mounts to carry them as they explore what is now Mexico and the Southwest, did the horse reappear on American soil. Hope Ryden describes how the Plains Indians adopted the horse, which transformed their culture. But many of their horses escaped into the wild and reverted to primitive behaviors-such as forming tight-knit social groups with complicated social hierarchies-that enabled them to thrive and survive. Horse lovers and history buffs, as well as all who relish a good true-life adventure, will be fascinated and moved by this compelling portrait of a national treasure. Bibliography.",

This is where Regie Routman steps in: giving clarity, support, specific demonstrations, and confidence to teachers so they can teach reading in a manner that is consistent with research and learning theory and respectful of students' needs, interests, and abilities. In Reading Essentials, she realistically describes how to achieve these goals-and get high test scores too.   Based on her continuing work teaching in schools, Routman proves that good teaching doesn't have to mean lots of hours spent planning. What's necessary is good thinking-thinking about what matters to kids, what kids need to know, how we can move them forward, and how to ensure that they comprehend and enjoy what they read-including struggling students. Readers will discover research-based strategies, immediately doable ideas, and detailed lessons-all based on an instructional framework that includes:  demonstrations shared demonstrations guided practice independent practice.  Thoughout the text, Routman emphasizes the use of professional common sense and demonstrates how to maximize your time, making the most of every teachable moment. Practical, philosophical, and political, Reading Essentials gets to the heart of what excellent reading instruction is all about-and puts the fun back into your teaching.",

        "Description": "David Lindsey is one of the modern masters of crime fiction. His 1983 novel, A Cold Mind, is often cited as one of the half dozen best suspense novels ever written; Mercy, published in 1990, completely redefined the psychological thriller and became a huge national bestseller; his most recent novel, Body of Truth, was critically acclaimed as one of those rare thrillers that is as morally complex and intelligent as it is suspenseful. Now, with An Absence of Light, he has again expanded the boundaries of crime fiction, leading us from the top-secret world of police department Intelligence Divisions into the frighteningly sophisticated and violent dark heart of international drug and arms dealers.All major urban police departments have Intelligence Divisions - investigative squads that are highly sensitive because they collect secrets about men and women who have not yet committed any crime. An Absence of Light opens with the discovery of the body of Arthur Tisler, an investigator in Houston's Intelligence Division, who is found in his parked car with a bullet in his head. Everyone from the homicide cops to the chief of police hopes it's suicide; if it is, the case can be quickly and quietly closed. If, on the other hand, Tisler's death is in any way related to his secret investigations, it could bring down the entire police department.Marcus Graver, who heads Houston's Intelligence Division, realizes he cannot adequately pursue Tisler's death \"inside,\" so he gets help from Arnette, a freelancer who has spent most of her career in the Far East for the CIA. When Arnette's surveillance team leads her to Panos Kalatis - a former legendary deep-cover agent for the Mossad who is now one of the richest and most vicious criminals in the world - she realizes Graver is way out of his league. In fact, Arnette knows, if the enemy is Kalatis, the entire Houston Police Department is out of its league.In An Absence of Light David Lindsey takes us into the terrifying new world of global high-tech crime, a brutal shadow world where men of limitless power and wealth operate almost as nations, trading billions of dollars' worth of drugs and weapons in an arena without borders, without laws, and devoid of any kind of morality.",

One of the most important achievements of the past millennium, it did for biology what Galileo did for astronomy: made it into a single science rather than a collection of unrelated facts. Important though Origin remains, its examples and intricate Victorian prose are now a century and a half old. They are ripe for renewal and reaffirmation. Writing as \"Darwin's ghost,\" eminent geneticist Steve Jones updates this seminal work\u2014and restates evolution's case for the 21st century.Jones is a writer of engaging wit and dazzling erudition and has been called \"the British Carl Sagan.\" Using modern examples\u2014the AIDS virus, the puzzles of sexual selection, the physiology and psychology of pets, and the unparalleled genetic success of our own species\u2014he shows the power and immediacy of Darwin's great argument and makes us appreciate how it makes life make sense. Eye-opening and entertaining, filled with astonishing facts, amusing anecdotes, and the very latest research, Darwin's Ghost is contemporary science writing at its very best.",

        "Description": "Years ago, an ancient Phoenician statue known as the Navigator was stolen from the Baghdad Museum, and there are men who would do anything to get their hands on it. Their first victim is a crooked antiquities dealer, murdered in cold blood. Their second very nearly is a UN investigator who, were it not for the timely assistance of Austin and Zavala, would now be at the bottom of a watery grave.  What's so special about this statue? Austin wonders. The search for answers will take the NUMA team on an astonishing odyssey through time and space, one that encompasses no less than the lost treasures of King Solomon, a mysterious packet of documents personally encoded by Thomas Jefferson, and a top secret scientific project that could change the world forever.  And that's before the surprises really begin . . .  Rich with all the hair-raising action and endless invention that have become Cussler's hallmarks, The Navigator is Clive's best yet.",
