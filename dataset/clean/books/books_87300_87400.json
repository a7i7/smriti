        "Description": "\"An eloquent documentary, forming the facts into a mosaic that shows the terribleness of war. . . . Striking, poignant, tragic.\"--New York TimesIn July 1863 the invading Army of Northern Virginia, confident from its victory at Chancellorsville, unexpectedly encountered the Army of the Potomac, still without a general Lincoln could trust, at a small town in Pennsylvania. And there, among the verdant hills, rich fields, and sparkling brooks around Gettysburg, the two armies slaughtered each other in fearful numbers. My Enemy, My Brother is a remarkable re-creation of that battle, told not as military strategists have told it, but the way soldiers, doctors, shopkeepers, farmers, and wives lived it. Drawn from the letters, diaries, and memoirs of the people at Gettysburg, Persico's powerful work chronicles the passions and beliefs, the day-to-day routines, the pain and the terror of those caught up in the epic conflict that, for thousands, became their last role on earth.",

They're playing better venues, in front of bigger crowds-and the people showing up at the after parties are increasingly good-looking and cool. Some even radiate power, like \"Master\" Jeffries, the tall, saturnine man who seems to have some sort of weird control over Dave's fellow bandmates.But Dave's too tired to pay much attention to Jeffries. He's tired a lot, lately, and making music isn't as much fun as it used to be. Probably he's just working-and partying-too hard.Luckily, Dave has a friend who takes what's happening to him very seriously. Diana Tregarde is a practicing witch and a Guardian of the Earth. It's her job to keep an eye on innocents like Dave and make sure they stay out of trouble and don't become someone's lunch.Jeffries has been on Diana's hit list since she first spotted him pursuing a young Romany. Di wasn't fast enough to stop him, but the Rom have their own protector-a dashing, charming, very attractive vampire named Andre Le Brel. Together, the witch and the vampire face Jeffries and his evil minions in a battle for the soul of rock 'n' roll... in Children of the Night by Mercedes Lackey.",

All he knows when he wakes up the next day in the hospital is that his head is sore and bandaged. His effort to recover the moments of his life that have been stolen from him leads him on an unexpected detour. What he needs is someone who can do the remembering for him. What he gets is . . . well, something quite different.",

        "Description": "Inc. magazine Entrepreneur of the Year and International Automotive Hall of Fame member Marion Luna Brem reveals the strategies she learned that have made her successful in sales\u2014and in life. As Brem makes clear, we\u2019re all  salesmen in one way or another. Whenever we try to make a good first impression or persuade someone else of our point of view, we\u2019re selling ourselves. Brem shows how to do it better.It was the definition of a \u201cliving nightmare.\u201d Marion Luna Brem, a thirty-year-old mother of two, had just been told the most dreadful words anyone could hear: \u201cYou have two to five years to live.\u201d She had no job. No health insurance. Her marriage would collapse under the stress of her treatment. And her most pressing concern: How do I pay next month\u2019s rent?\u201cYou\u2019ve always been good with people. Why don\u2019t you try sales?\u201d her best friend suggested.After sixteen fruitless job interviews, Brem landed her first major \u201csale\u201d \u2013 a job as a car salesman. Within two months, Brem had become salesperson of the month, and by the end of her first year, salesperson of the year. Four and a half years after selling her first car, Brem bought her own dealership, and in the next decade went on to open additional dealerships and businesses.In WOMEN MAKE THE BEST SALESMEN, Marion Luna Brem reveals countless unconventional sales stratagems she discovered, refined, and applied to build a multimillion dollar enterprise. As she makes abundantly clear, the skills one learns in sales are transferable to all walks of life. \u201cThe fact is we are all \u2018salesmen\u2019 \u2013 whether we are selling ourselves at a job interview or operating a register at a department store, trying to get our children into a special program or looking for a lifelong companion. And women, with their natural social skills and acute emotional antennae, have natural advantages both sexes can learn from.\u201d Using examples from her own business and personal life, Brem reveals how to create a niche and name for yourself, how to turn a no into a yes, how to persuade even the most difficult people, how to open new doors, and how to close deals",

An essay on editing the text provides an in-depth look at the quartos and folios used in the edition.

A look at the lasting influence of the play on music, art, film, and dance creates an interdisciplinary framework with which to approach the play. Better Notes \u2013 Through one-word margin definitions, facing-page glosses, and longer end notes after the play, our innovative approach to notes pulls readers away from the text fewer times while providing them with more information and comprehensive analysis. Further Reading \u2013 An annotated bibliography of titles, hand-selected by the introduction author, takes readers beyond the edition for further reading.Shakespeare\u2019s compelling treatment of guilt and revenge in Hamlet has fascinated playgoers and readers for 400 years.

        "Title": "The Oxford Book of Modern Fairy Tales",
        "Authors": "By Lurie, Alison (EDT)",
        "Description": "The stories of magic and transformation that we call fairy tales are among the oldest known forms of literature, and many the most popular.  \"Jack and the Beanstalk,\" \"Sleeping Beauty,\" \"Little Red Ridinghood\"--these ageless tales seem to have been written an almost magically long time ago. Yet fairy tales are still being created to this very day.  And while they are principally directed to children and have child protagonists, these modern fairy tales, like the classics, have messages to those of all ages.     In The Oxford Book of Modern Fairy Tales, Alison Lurie has collected forty tales that date from the late nineteenth century up to the present.  Here are trolls and princesses, magic and mayhem, morals to be told and lessons to be learned--all the elements of the classic fairy tale, in new and fantastical trappings. In Charles Dickens's \"The Magic Fishbone,\" we find an unusually pragmatic princess who uses her one wish only after she has tried to solve her family's problems through hard work. Angela Carter's \"The Courtship of Mr. Lyon\" is a \"Beauty and the Beast\" tale with a contemporary twist, in which Beauty leaves Beast to live the high life, becoming a society brat who \"smiled at herself in mirrors too much.\"  And in T.H. White's \"The Troll,\" we find out how his father killed the troll that tried to eat him.     In these enchanting pages we also see how modern writers have taken the classic fairy tale and adapted it to their times in a variety of ways. Francis Browne, for example, takes a poke at Victorian standards of beauty in \"The Story of Fairyfoot,\" about a young prince who is cast out of the kingdom of Stumpinghame because, unlike the fashion of the town, his feet are too small.  Some writers, such as Ursula Le Guin, have taken familiar myths and turned them upside down.  In Le Guin's \"The Wife's Story,\" a mother sees the horrible transformation of her husband into \"the hateful one\", and then watches her sister and neighbors mob and kill this \"creature whose hair had begun to come away all over his body...the eyes gone blue...staring at me out of that flat, soft, white face.\"  And L.F. Baum's \"The Queen of Quok,\" contains a castle and royal characters in a kingdom run by common sense and small-town American values.  At one point the boy king of Quok has to borrow a dime from his counsellor to buy a ham sandwich, and greed transforms his young queen-to-be into a haggard old woman.     With tales from the likes of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oscar Wilde, Carl Sandburg, James Thurber, Donald Barthelme, Louise Erdrich, and many more, The Oxford Book of Modern Fairy Tales brings us through the modern-day world of the supernatural, the mystical, the moral, and reminds us that fairy tales are still very much alive.",

And as an award-winning journalist for The Sun (Baltimore), he was more likely to write about scoundrels than soccer. But his son caught the bug, and before long, Haner was giving pep talks to nine-year-olds in shin guards and cleats and the game had become an all-consuming obsession.Digging deep into the historical record, Haner sets out to document the soccer craze from the bottom up, tracing the rises and falls in the game's popularity in the decades since \"Mob Ball\" fever was spread by the influx of immigrants on our shores, up to the current wave of \"soccermania.\" The result is a rollicking and timely read.\"[Haner's] enthusiasm and good humor is infectious, the history is genuinely interesting, and anyone who doubts that soccer games between nine-year-olds can be chronicled with the same verve and intensity of professional or collegiate sports need look no further . . . Belongs with Franklin Foer's How Soccer Explains the World (2004) as a must-read for people puzzled by soccer's popularity.\" --Booklist (starred review)",
