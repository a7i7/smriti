        "Description": "When a high-powered gallery owner collides with a wildly offbeat artist, it\u2019s the  perfect recipe for disaster. But in her 63rd bestselling novel, Danielle Steel proves  that when two hopelessly mismatched people share a love for art, a passion for each  other, and a city like Paris, nothing is truly impossible\u2026or is it?  Everything Sasha  does is within the boundaries of tradition. Liam is sockless in December.  Sasha  is widowed, a woman who knows she was lucky enough to be married to the most wonderful  man in the world and thankful for every moment they had. Liam is half in and half  out of a marriage that only a \u201cwacky\u201d artist could manage, and that his own impossibly  impulsive behavior has helped tear apart. But while Sasha has been methodically building  her father\u2019s Parisian art gallery into an intercontinental success story, Liam has  been growing into one of the most original and striking young painters of his time.  So while the two are utterly unalike\u2013and a nine-year age difference stares them squarely  in the face\u2013the miracle of art brings them crashing together. Now the question is,  can Sasha guard her reputation while juggling a secret, somewhat scandalous relationship?  And how can Liam, who lives for the moment, put up with a woman who insists on having  things her own way, in her own style, and at her own time?  For Sasha, it\u2019s a matter  of keeping Liam hidden from her grown children and well-heeled clientele as she commutes  between New York and Paris and two thriving galleries. For Liam, it\u2019s about creating  chaos out of order, bringing out the wild streak that Sasha barely knows she has,  of choosing pizza over foie gras, and making love when others are busy making money.   That is, until a family tragedy suddenly alters Liam\u2019s life\u2013and forces a choice  and a sacrifice that neither one of them could have expected.  But from the snow  falling on the Tuileries to the joy of eating ice cream by candlelight, the artist  and the art dealer have tasted perfection.  And giving up now might just be the most  impossible thing of all.  With unerring insight into the hearts of men and women\u2013 and into the soul of the artist \u2013Danielle Steel takes us into a world of glamour  and genius, priceless art and dazzling creativity. From the luxurious galleries of  Europe to the endless beaches of the Hamptons, ImPossible weaves an extraordinary  tale of love and compromise, of taking chances and counting blessings.  With brilliant  color and breathtaking emotion, Danielle Steel has written her most compelling novel  to date.From the Hardcover edition.",

Bill Hybels and his wife, Lynne, tell about Willow Creek\u2019s beginnings, its struggles, the philosophy behind its success, and the strategies that have made it a model for church growth. The first half of the book, written by Lynne Hybels, explores the early years of Willow Creek and the personal accounts behind one of this century's most remarkable church stories. It offers an honest look at the ways God has used both the strengths and weaknesses of His people, creating a church of believers who have had tremendous impact for Christ in their community. In the second half of Rediscovering Church, Bill Hybels helps you apply the strengths of Willow Creek's ministry philosophy to your own congregation's mission. From mission statements to developing leadership, making sound financial decisions, and handling growth, Bill stresses that God wants to build His church to be an effective and committed community of faith that reaches out to a hurting world, to be the body of Christ in real and tangible ways. Rediscovering Church draws on the experiences of Willow Creek to show how one fellowship crystallized its mission and methodology, its vision and values. The Willow Creek story provides an example that churches and individuals alike can turn to for inspiration, encouragement, and a means of uncovering the pattern for their own unique mission and ministry.",

Fitting in with Southerners was hard enough, but trying to understand friends, lovers, and herself while unemployed in a foreign country sends Darren reeling. The world that spirals around her is full of outrageous encounters, interracial affairs, and nights of drunken revelry. Against the backdrop of a society that is governed by hospitality and good manners but is full of strangers and unfamiliar customs, Darren runs headlong into her own insecurities, fears, and desires.It is not surprising that Melanie Sumner's remarkable fiction has received early recognition from The New Yorker, which published selections from this book. With sly humor and acuity, Sumner invents a youthful heroine who is stubborn and selfish, loving and libidinous, and, ultimately, unsparingly human.

Against a genteel country landscape of formal parks and stately homes, the gossipy Mrs. Norris becomes a masterful comic creation; the fickle young suitor Henry Crawford provides an unequaled portrait of an unscrupulous young man; and the complexly drawn Fanny Price emerges as one of Jane Austen\u2019s finest achievements\u2014the poor cousin who comes to stay with her wealthy relatives at Mansfield Park and learns how the game of love can too easily turn to folly. More intricately plotted and wider in scope than Austen\u2019s earlier works, Mansfield Park continues to enchant and delight us as a superb example of a great author\u2019s craft.",

        "Authors": "By Fishman, Charles",
        "Description": "An award-winning journalist breaks through the wall of secrecy to reveal the many astonishing ways Wal-Mart's power affects our lives and reaches all around the world.  The Wal-Mart Effect: The overwhelming impact of the world's largest company--due to its relentless pursuit of low prices--on retailers and manufacturers, wages and jobs, the culture of shopping, the shape of our communities, and the environment; a global force of unprecedented nature. Wal-Mart is not only the world's largest company; it is also the largest company in the history of the world. Americans spend $26 million every hour at Wal-Mart, twenty-four hours of every day, every day of the year. Is the company a good thing or a bad thing? On the one hand, market guru Warren Buffett estimates that the company's low prices save American consumers $10 billion a year. On the other, the behemoth is the #1 employer in thirty-seven of the fifty states yet has never let a union in the door.  Though 70 percent of Americans now live within a fifteen-minute drive of a Wal-Mart store, we have not even begun to understand the true power of the company and the many ways it is shaping American life. We know about the lawsuits and the labor protests, but what we don't know is how profoundly the \"Wal-Mart effect\" is shaping our lives.  Fast Company senior editor Fishman, whose revelatory cover story on Wal-Mart generated the strongest reader response in the history of the magazine, takes us on an unprecedented behind-the-scenes investigative expedition deep inside the many worlds of Wal-Mart. He reveals the radical ways in which the company is transforming America's economy, our workforce, our communities, and our environment. Fishman penetrated the secrecy of Wal-Mart headquarters, interviewing twenty-five high-level ex-executives; he journeyed into the world of a host of Wal-Mart's suppliers to uncover how the company strong-arms even the most established brands; and journeyed to the ports and factories, the fields and forests where Wal-Mart's power is warping the very structure of the world's market for goods. Wal-Mart is not just a retailer anymore, Fishman argues. It has become a kind of economic ecosystem, and anyone who wants to understand the forces shaping our world today must understand the company's hidden reach.",

        "Authors": "By Hyman, Mark and Herbert, Martha, M.D., Ph.D. (FRW)",
        "Description": "A hidden epidemic races around the globe -- we can't see it or touch it, which makes it so dangerous.   The invisible epidemic has led to the suffering of millions who spend billions on drugs, only to find they don't work.   This is an epidemic of broken brains.   \"Broken brains\" go by many names -- depression, anxiety, memory loss, brain fog, attention deficit disorder, autism, and dementia, to name a few -- and show up in radically different ways from person to person, making each seem like a separate problem.   But the truth is that these \"diagnoses\" are all the result of a few basic problems with our biology. Pinpoint these biological problems, fix them, and let your body's natural healing intelligence take over to repair your brain. Now you can experience an UltraMind -- one that is highly focused and able to pay attention at will, with a strong, reliable memory and a mood that is calm, confident, in control, and in good spirits.   We have all heard of the mind-body connection or how our thoughts affect the health of our body. But the reverse is far more powerful: what you do to your body, your basic biology, has a profound effect on your brain.   Have you ever experienced instant clarity after exercise? Alertness after drinking coffee? A mental crash after popping candy? Does your brain inexplicably slow down during stress, while multitasking, or when meeting a deadline? Each is an example of how what we do to our bodies -- whether through nutrition, sleep, exercise, or stress -- has a dramatic effect on our brains.   Conventional treatments don't help, or provide only slight benefit, because they just manage symptoms rather than deal with -- and heal -- the underlying problem. And just as brain problems all stem from the same root causes, they all have the same solution -- The UltraMind Solution.   Our ancient genes interact with our environment to create systemic imbalances that affect our brains. Correct those imbalances -- most caused by nutritional deficiencies, allergens, infections, toxins, and stress -- and you can achieve optimum mental health without drugs or psychotherapy.   The UltraMind Solution is the future of medicine, the culmination of the last twenty years of research on what makes the brain happy, focused, and calm; research that has uncovered a few simple factors that explain why things go wrong and how to fix them.   Don't wait for this revolution in medicine to trickle into your doctor's office: it usually takes research twenty years to move from the lab to the patient. The answers are here, right now, in The UltraMind Solution.",

The Christians  I meet seem to me to be the most uncomfortable people anywhere around. I, for one,  do not care to have that sort of religion.\" As a result, The God of All  Comfort was written. Far from the abundant life promised by Christ, most Christians  live in defeat and despair. The object of this book is to reveal the secret  of this abundant life and victory over defeat, to bring genuine and enduring joy  into the lives of troubled Christians, to show that everything Christ promised is  available today to all believers, and\u00a0to put within reach of every Christian  that deep and lasting peace and comfort in the soul that nothing earthly can disturb.  Both God's part and man's part are explained. Colorful illustrations and anecdotes  and picturesque language illuminate every page, clarifying the vital message of  this book.",

But any community, however smoothly run, suffers tremors when it takes in someone by force. And the arrival of Santa Caterina\u2019s new novice sets in motion a chain of events that will shake the convent to its core.Ripped by her family from an illicit love affair, sixteen-year-old Serafina is willful, emotional, sharp, and defiant\u2013young enough to have a life to look forward to and old enough to know when that life is being cut short. Her first night inside the walls is spent in an incandescent rage so violent that the dispensary mistress, Suora Zuana, is dispatched to the girl\u2019s cell to sedate her. Thus begins a complex relationship of trust and betrayal between the young rebel and the clever, scholarly nun, for whom the girl becomes the daughter she will never have.As Serafina rails against her incarceration, others are drawn into the drama: the ancient, mysterious Suora Magdalena\u2013with her history of visions and ecstasies\u2013locked in her cell; the ferociously devout novice mistress Suora Umiliana, who comes to see in the postulant a way to extend her influence; and, watching it all, the abbess, Madonna Chiara, a woman as fluent in politics as she is in prayer. As disorder and rebellion mount, it is the abbess\u2019s job to keep the convent stable while, outside its walls, the dictates of the Counter-Reformation begin to purge the Catholic Church and impose on the nunneries a regime of terrible oppression.Sarah Dunant, the bestselling author of The Birth of Venus and In the Company of the Courtesan, brings this intricate Renaissance world compellingly to life. Amid Sacred Hearts is a rich, engrossing, multifaceted love story, encompassing the passions of the flesh, the exultation of the spirit, and the deep, enduring power of friendship.",
