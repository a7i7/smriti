        "Description": "Since 9/11, we need to better understand the terrorism we face and reflect upon how we should best respond to it. Edited by James P. Sterba, this collection of new essays on terrorism and international justice focuses on three central questions: What is the nature and rhetoric of terrorism? Who are the terrorists and why do they hate? and What is a morally justified response to terrorism? Prominent philosophers and political thinkers--including Shannon E. French, Tomis Kapitan, Noam Chomsky, David B. Burrell, Robert L. Phillips, Zayn Kassam, Louis P. Pojman, Daniele Archibugi, Iris Marion Young, Claudia Card, Richard W. Miller, Martha C. Nussbaum, and Sterba himself--provide diverse perspectives on these and other related questions. The first post-9/11 collection of primarily philosophical articles on this topic, Terrorism and International Justice is ideal for courses in moral problems and ethics, social and political philosophy, war and terrorism, international relations and foreign policy, and peace studies. It will also interest anyone who wants to delve more deeply into the philosophical issues of the post-9/11 world.",

        "Description": "A Brookings Institution Press and Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation publicationA fundamental, but mostly hidden, transformation is happening in the way public services are being delivered, and in the way local and national governments fulfill their policy goals. Government executives are redefining their core responsibilities away from managing workers and providing services directly to orchestrating networks of public, private, and nonprofit organizations to deliver the services that government once did itself. Authors Stephen Goldsmith and William D. Eggers call this new model \"governing by network\" and maintain that the new approach is a dramatically different type of endeavor that simply managing divisions of employees.Like any changes of such magnitude, it poses major challenges for those in charge. Faced by a web of relationships and partnerships that increasingly make up modern governance, public managers must grapple with skill-set issues (managing a contract to capture value); technology issues (incompatible information systems); communications issues (one partner in the network, for example, might possess more information than another); and cultural issues (how interplay among varied public, private, and nonprofit sector cultures can create unproductive dissonance).Governing by Network examines for the first time how managers on both sides of the aisle, public and private, are coping with the changes. Drawing from dozens of case studies, as well as established best practices, the authors tell us what works and what doesn't. Here is a clear roadmap for actually governing the networked state for elected officials, business executives, and the broader public.",

Ratey provides insight   into the basic structure and chemistry of the brain, and demonstrates how its systems   shape our perceptions, emotions, and behavior. By giving us a greater understanding   of how the brain responds to the guidance of its user, he provides us with knowledge   that can enable us to improve our lives. In A User\u2019s Guide to the Brain, Ratey clearly   and succinctly surveys what scientists now know about the brain and how we use it.   He looks at the brain as a malleable organ capable of improvement and change, like   any muscle, and examines the way specific motor functions might be applied to overcome   neural disorders ranging from everyday shyness to autism. Drawing on examples from   his practice and from everyday life, Ratey illustrates that the most important lesson   we can learn about our brains is how to use them to their maximum potential.",
