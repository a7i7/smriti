This gives A THOUSAND ACRES the prismatic quality of the greatest art.' -- Chicago Tribune Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award",

He argues that the turn towards regime change has left an unresolved tension in US foreign policy--behavior change versus regime change--that frustrates the effective integration of force and diplomacy and points to Libya's dismantling of its WMD programs as an example of effective diplomacy of the type that could be upset by too much careless regime change rhetoric. Finally, he illustrate his argument with case studies of US approaches towards Iraq, Libya, Iran, North Korea, and nonstate actors such as Al Qaeda.

        "Authors": "By Hirshberg, Gary",
        "Description": "A true force for change, Gary Hirshberg has been at the forefront of movements working for environmental and social transformation for 30 years. From his early days as an educator and activist to his current position as President and CE-Yo of Stonyfield Farm, the world's largest organic yogurt company, Hirshberg's positive outlook has inspired thousands of people to recognize their ability to make the world a better place.In Stirring It Up, Hirshberg calls on individuals to realize their power to effect change in the marketplace--\"the power of one\"--while proving that environmental commitment makes for a healthier planet and a healthier bottom line. Drawing from his 25 years' experience growing Stonyfield Farm from a 7-cow start-up, as well as the examples of like-minded companies, such as Newman's Own, Patagonia, Wal-Mart and Timberland, Hirshberg presents stunning evidence that business not only can save the planet, but is able to simultaneously deliver higher growth and superior profits as well.Hirshberg illustrates his points with practical information and advice, as well as engaging anecdotes from what he calls \"the bad old days\" of his yogurt company: how a power outage left him milking cows by hand, how a dumpster fire revealed the need for better packaging, and his camel manure taste test challenge to a local shock jock. He also describes hands-on grassroots marketing strategies--printing yogurt lids with provocative, politically charged messages, handing out thousands of free samples to subway commuters to thank them for using public transit, and devising the country's first organic vending machine--explaining how these approaches make a much more powerful impact on consumers than traditional advertising.An inspiring book for business owners and managers as well as anyone interested in saving the environment, Stirring It Up demonstrates how companies can work to save the planet, while achieving greater profits and satisfaction, and how we can all use the power of conscious consumption to encourage green corporate behavior.",

        "Description": "From cholesterol to cancer, asteroids to AIDS, we face more risks than our grandparents ever dreamed of. But most of us are 200 years behind the curve when it comes to making intelligent risk-based decisions: We refuse to fly, but don\u2019t wear seat belts in our far more dangerous cars. We panic about toxic waste dumps, but collectively smoke a billion cigarettes a year. In this entertaining and enlightening look at risk in the modern age, John Ross argues that the burgeoning science of risk assessment has given us powerful new tools to cope in a complex world, if we could only learn how to speak the language. Ross examines the building blocks of this new language, and helps us identify and relinquish long-held, often pre-set, biological and psychological responses to risk. Through vivid stories and compelling science, Ross empowers us to take control of our lives and to exercise our most basic democratic freedom\u2014the power to make our own decisions\u2014both as individuals and as a society.",

The popularity (and power) of these applications stems from their accessibility and usability: thousands of users can access the same data at the same time without theneed to install any additional software on their computers.Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL offersweb developers a mixture of theoretical and practical information on creating web database applications. Using PHP, and MySQL, two open source technologies that are often combined to develop web applications, the book offers detailed information on designing relational databases and on web application architecture, both of which will be useful to readers who have never dealt with these issues before.  The book also introduces Hugh and Dave's OnlineWines, a complete (but fictional) online retail site that allows users to browse, search a database, add items to a shopping cart, manage their membership, and purchase wines. Using this site as an example, the book shows you how to implement searching and browsing, store user data, validate user input, manage transactions, and maintain security.If you want to build small to medium-scale web database applications that can run on modest hardware and process more than a million hits a day from users, this book will show you how.",

        "Title": "Without a Map: A Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Hall, Meredith",
        "Description": "Meredith Hall\u2019s moving but unsentimental memoir begins in 1965, when she becomes pregnant at sixteen. Shunned by her insular New Hampshire community, she is then kicked out of the house by her mother. Her father and stepmother reluctantly take her in, hiding her before they finally banish her altogether. After giving her baby up for adoption, Hall wanders recklessly through the Middle East, where she survives by selling her possessions and finally her blood. She returns to New England and stitches together a life that encircles her silenced and invisible grief. When he is twenty-one, her lost son finds her. Hall learns that he grew up in gritty poverty with an abusive father\u2014in her own father\u2019s hometown. Their reunion is tender, turbulent, and ultimately redemptive. Hall\u2019s parents never ask for her forgiveness, yet as they age, she offers them her love. What sets Without a Map apart is the way in which loss and betrayal evolve into compassion, and compassion into wisdom.\"Meredith Hall boldly charts one of the bravest of stories, the journey from disrupted youth up through that most tricky and forbidding territory, the family circle. Bone-honest and strong in its every line, this work of memory is a remarkably deep retrieval of its times and souls, thereby reflecting our own.\" \u2014Ivan Doig, author of Heart Earth\u201cThis is an unusually elegant memoir that feels as though its been carved straight out of Meredith Hall\u2019s capacious heart. The story is riveting, the words perfect. It is rare to read a work that manages to be at once artful and compelling, which for me best describes Meredith Hall\u2019s debut work. She is an author who deserves to be widely read. Few people write like this. Fewer still have the courage to live like this \u2013 without the comfort of any clich\u00e9.\u201d \u2014Lauren Slater, author of Opening Skinner's Box, Prozac Diary, and Welcome to My Country \u201cMeredith Hall\u2019s long journey from an inexcusably betrayed girlhood to the bittersweet mercies of womanhood is a triple triumph\u2014of survival; of narration; and of forgiveness. Her portrait of her own empty bravado collapsing into total psychological and geographical dislocation is one of the most harrowing passages I\u2019ve ever read. The subsequent turn toward memory and honesty is agonized, profound, and salvific. Without a Map is a masterpiece.\u201d \u2014David James Duncan, author of The Brothers K and God Laughs and Plays\u201cMeredith Hall is like a geiger counter ticking along the radium edge of these recent decades. She gives us self as expert-witness\u2014Without a Map is smart, sharp, and redemptively honest. \u201d \u2014Sven Birkerts, author of The Gutenberg Elegies and My Sky Blue Trades\u201cMeredith Hall\u2019s story of loss, shame, and betrayal is also a story of joy, reconnection, and survival; each memory takes us deep to the marrow of sorrow and celebration. A work of extraordinary beauty and grace.\u201d \u2014Kim Barnes, author of In the Wilderness: Coming of Age in Unknown Country\"Without A Map tells an important and perceptive story about loss, about aloneness and isolation in a time of great need, about a life slowly coming back into focus and the calm that finally emerges. Meredith Hall is a brave new writer who earns our attention.\" \u2014Annie Dillard, author of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek\u201cThink for a moment of Shakespeare\u2019s The Winter\u2019s Tale, of banishment, reconciliation, redemption, and you\u2019ll get the scope of Without a Map, the new memoir by Meredith Hall . . . An extraordinary tale, made all the more moving by Hall\u2019s unsentimental prose and ample heart.\u201d \u2014gettrio.com\u201ca compelling, painful, hopeful story.\u201d \u2014more.com\"Meredith Hall's magnificent book held me in its thrall from the moment I began reading the opening pages. WITHOUT A MAP is a fluid, beautifully-written, hard-won piece of work that belongs on the shelf next to the best modern memoirs, and yet is in a category all its own. It is a moving example of a difficult life redeemed first through examination, then reeflection, then finally\u2014like a rough stone polished until it gleams\u2014into a genuine work of art.\" \u2014Dani Shapiro, author of Family History\u201cHall, a brave and graceful writer who teaches at UNH, examines her life with wide open eyes and an equally open heart. Even as she wrestles with the grief of many losses\u2014her child, her parents\u2019 love and respect, her standing in her community, her identity\u2014she demonstrates the writer\u2019s gift of separating from her own experiences, establishing an objectivity that allows her to make meaning for herself and readers.\u201d \u2014Rebecca Rule, Nashua Telegraph\u201cOpen adoptions and connections between birth mothers and their children were not the way of life for a young girl who got pregnant in the '60s. Meredith Hall, in her beautifully written, poignant memoir, tells us what life was like for a naive girl who found herself pregnant and abandoned by her mother and father. This is a tale of loss, of endless traveling in search of an intangible something, and, uuuuultimately, of forgiveness.\u201d \u2014Gayle Shanks, Changing Hands Bookstore, Tempe, AZ\u201cHall\u2019s sensitive, honest account of her personal odyssey shows one remarkable woman transcending this trauma to become a better, stronger person.\u201d \u2014Wendy Smith, AARP The Magazine\u201cHall's life, as depicted in this memoir, was nothing if not two things\u2014difficult and fascinating. With no family, friends or other support system, she took her life into her own hands at an early, tender age, and she fell quite far before finally rising up. The reader gets the benefit of her trials, a gritty view of the world from America to Europe to the Middle East.\u201d \u2014INtake Weekly\u201cWithout a Map tells a stunning story of exile and ostracization. Meredith grew up on the seacoast of New Hampshire and became pregnant at age 16, in 1965. Her memoir is a rare and clear glimpse into the social mores of the mid 60's, and reveals the state of shame many families faced when an unmarried daughter became pregnant.\u201d \u2014Liz Bulkley, Host of \u201cThe Front Porch,\u201d NH Public Radio\u201cAppalling and infuriating, yet uplifting and inspiring, Without A Map pulls you into Hall\u2019s personal experience of sudden rejection and expulsion from her only sources of sustenance and connection. As an adoptive parent I cried and cheered for her through her exile and return to a very different home. Meredith Hall is a hero of awesome courage and eloquence.\u201d \u2014Frank Kramer, Harvard Book Store, Cambridge, MA\u201c[Without a Map] is a searing memoir about loss, betrayal, love and, in some measure, reconciliation. It has already brought Hall a celebrity that surprises her: stories in People, Oprah and Elle, an interview on National Public Radio, brisk sales in a crowded marketplace. It is on the extended New York Times bestseller list. What is arresting about this memoir is the world it reveals.\u201d \u2014Mike Pride, Concord Monitor\u201cWithout a Map, is so well written that it was hard for me to accept that the book had to end.\" \u2014Tina Ristau, The Des Moines Register\"Painfully honest and beautifully written\u2026Meredith Hall has managed to distill courage from raw pain, and then somehow write this gem of a book about the experience\u2026A stunning book\u2026You must read it.\u201d \u2014Lola Furber, Maine Women\u2019s Journal\u201cFans of Jeannette Walls\u2019 The Glass Castle should take note of Meredith Hall\u2019s memoir, heartbreaking and ultimately heartwarming...\" \u2014Mary Cotton, owner of Newtonville Books, Newton TAB\u201cI\u2019m awed by Meredith Hall\u2019s wisdom and integrity, by her gorgeous prose that deepens my understanding of resilience and love, of loss and forgiveness.

The only thing he regrets is that he didn't pull the trigger, or so he thinks. When he reunites with his sister, Julia, at their childhood home, the siblings' reactions could not be more different. While Julia sees to funeral arrangements and plans a memorial, Junior rages out of control, his anger at his father for a lifetime of violence and abuse matched only by his need to seek vengeance for the man's death.Yet Julia suffers too, hiding her own hurt and filling the role of the responsible daughter, while Junior, unhinged by his father's death and frustrated by the cops' stagnant investigation, hunts for his own answers. Two detectives assigned to the case - one a childhood friend of Junior's, the other a veteran cop who knew John Sr. - are simply roadblocks in his path to justice.But a string of dead ends and violent encounters leaves Junior no closer than the cops to any answers. His relationship with his beloved sister crumbles, while his affair with an old high school sweetheart wreaks havoc on his fracturing psyche. Despite the helping hands extended to him, Junior turns his back on those who love him most; the memories of his childhood have left him broken. When a chance at revenge finally arrives, he must decide whether he will continue the chain of violence that has nearly destroyed him, or accept the challenge of a new beginning.",

He escaped from an abusive home as a teenager and lived by his wits on the streets of Washington D.C.  It wasn\u2019t until he realized that dyslexia gave him the ability to see the world in unique ways that he found success, using this newfound strength to become a top ATF agent. When a terrible accident takes the life of his only daughter, Emma, and his marriage falls apart, Jack blames himself, numbing the pain by submerging himself in work.  Then he receives a call from his old friend Edward Carson.  Carson is just weeks from taking the reins as President of the United States when his daughter, Alli, is kidnapped.  Because Emma McClure was once Alli\u2019s best friend, Carson turns to Jack, the one man he can trust to go to any lengths to find his daughter and bring her home safely. The search for Alli leads Jack on a road toward reconciliation . . . and into the path of a dangerous and calculating man.  Someone whose actions are as cold as they are brilliant.  Whose power and reach are seemingly infinite. Faith, redemption, and political intrigue play off one another as McClure uses his unique abilities to journey into the twisted mind of a stone cold genius who is constantly one step ahead of him.  Jack will soon discover that this man has affected his life and his country in more ways than he could ever imagine.",

        "Description": "AIDS, Lyme disease, and the deadly hantavirus are just a few of the dozens of new diseases to arrive in recent years. Old ones such as TB and cholera have returned with sharper virulence. Where do new diseases come from? Why are old ones back as vicious changelings? Why now? We created this epidemic of epidemics by transforming our environment and behavior - our landscape, technology, and sex lives. Thus we hasten microbes' evolution and our own, making the world a global village for diseases.In Man and Microbes, respected science writer Arno Karlen presents a dramatic panorama of the natural history of disease. Drawing on case studies and tales of medical detection, he uncovers the ills of ancient hunter-gatherers, relates the rise of diseases that came with each domesticated species, and exposes the origins of modern urban epidemics. Citing original sources and extensive research, Karlen recounts the terror of measles and smallpox that raked the ancient empires of Rome and China; the intertwined stories of leprosy and tuberculosis throughout thousands of years of history; the onslaught of European microbes that devastated the peoples of the Americas far more than did the firearms of their conquerors; and the much-forgotten influenza pandemic of 1918 that killed tens of millions. He also analyzes the most recent medical reports of mysterious new diseases from around the world and provides a view of how they have arisen and what they bode for the future.Man and Microbes makes clear that infection is a natural and necessary part of life. It shows how the search for food, shelter, and a safer, more prosperous life has altered the environment, changed the dance of adaptation between humans and microbes, and generated new diseases. The means to surmount the growing public health crisis in our ever-accelerating global society lie in the same ingenuity that created it. Understanding the complex and vital relationships between man and microbe can help us tame or make truce with our microbial fellow travelers on planet Earth.",

        "Title": "June 1941: Hitler and Stalin",
        "Authors": "By Lukacs, John",
        "Description": "This brilliant new work by the author of the best-selling Five Days in London, May 1940 is an unparalleled drama of two great leaders confronting each other in June 1941. It describes Hitler and Stalin\u2019s strange, calculating, and miscalculating relationship before the German invasion of Soviet Russia, with its gigantic (and unintended) consequences. John Lukacs questions many long-held beliefs; he suggests, for example, that among other things Hitler\u2019s first purpose involved England: if Stalin\u2019s Communist Russia were to be defeated, Hitler\u2019s Third Reich would be well-nigh invincible, and the British and American peoples would be forced to rethink the war against Hitler. The book offers penetrating insights and a new portrait of Hitler and Stalin, moved by their long-lasting inclinations. Yet among other things, Lukacs presents evidence that Hitler (rather than his generals) had moments of dark foreboding before the invasion. Stalin could not, because he wished not, believe that Hitler would choose the risk of a two-front war by attacking him; he was stunned and shocked and came close to a breakdown. But he recovered, grew into a statesman, and eventually became a prime victor of the Second World War. Such are the ironies of history; John Lukacs paints them with a shining narrative skill.",

We follow Helena as she grows from maiden to mother to wisewoman, experiencing both joy, with the birth of her child, and loss, when politics will force her lover to choose between her and the Empire. But when her son Constantine becomes Emperor she slowly discovers that her role has gone far beyond that of the traditional mother.Helena finds herself at the center of a crucial turning point in Western history as she seeks a way to bridge the pagan world of the Goddess and the new Christian Empire.

Despite his determination and stubborn resourcefulness--he tried crossing the river with boats and ropes and even on stepping-stones--Abel can't find a way to get back home.Days, then weeks and months, pass. Slowly, his soft habits disappear as he forages for food, fashions a warm nest in a hollow log, models clay statues of his family for company, and continues to brood on the problem of how to get across the river--and home.Abel's time on the island brings him a new understanding of the world he's separated from. Faced with the daily adventure of survival in his solitary, somewhat hostile domain, he is moved to reexamine the easy way of life he had always accepted and discovers skills and talents in himself that hold promise of a more meaningful life, if and when he should finally return to Mossville and his dear Amanda again.",

        "Authors": "By James, Kelvin Christopher",
        "Description": "Vibrant, magical, musical, pulsing with the rhythms of Trinidad and Harlem, Kelvin Christopher James's prose is as striking and bold as his subject matter. It speaks directly to the heart and the senses as it takes us to such exotic places as a lush but lethal garden of earthly delights or depicts a fledgling drug dealer's grisly revenge.Jumping Ship and Other Stories takes place in Trinidad, the United States, and in between. Part One is set in the Caribbean and gives us lyrical and sensuous tales of growing up and living there: A valiant woman defends her family from a Rastaman who means to frighten them from their home; a pair of tourists invite trouble when they try to photograph an Obeah (witchcraft) rite; a feud between a one-handed butcher and a humpbacked shoemaker reaches its dramatic climax at the full moon.Part Two lets us experience the journey made by those in the Caribbean who would come to the United States. In the title story, two village men jump ship to confront the unimaginable neon, crowds, and noise of the big city. In \"The Vagabond's Genie,\" a wry fugitive perpetrates a wild ruse at a guardhouse on the border.Part Three consists of moving and sometimes violent and shocking stories set in Harlem: A young man in prison contemplates the death of his older brother in a holdup; the relationship between two young drug dealers goes awry with terrifying results; a homeless woman lashes out to defend her territory. The final story concerns a father taking his young Americanized son home to the Caribbean to meet his grandmother for the first time.Kelvin Christopher James's Jumping Ship and Other Stories is about good and evil, rich and poor, macho and matriarchy, dislocation and the meaning of \"home.\" It is the exciting beginning of what promises to be a major literary career.",

I want to be able to say to  myself, 'I bled truth with her,' yes, that's what I want.  Be a knife  for me, and I, I swear, will be a knife for you.\"An awkward,  neurotic seller of rare books writes a desperate letter to a beautiful  stranger whom he sees at a class reunion.  This simple, lonely attempt  at seduction begins a love affair of words between Yair and Miriam, two  married, middle-aged adults, dissatisfied with their lives, yearning for  the connection that has always eluded them--and, eventually, reawakened  to feelings that they thought had passed them by.  Their correspondence  unfolds into an exchange of their most naked confessions: of desire,  childhood tragedies, joys, and humiliations. Through the  dialogue between Yair--a family man and surprisingly successful  adulterer, whose complex, guarded letters reveal a life of secrets kept  from the people closest to him--and Miriam, at first deceptively open  and warm, who fills her life with distraction to avoid a past full of  painful secrets, Be My Knife explores the nature and the limits of intimacy. A deep departure from David Grossman's previous work, Be My Knife is his subtlest, most passionate novel yet.",

        "Title": "Antietam: The Soldiers' Battle",
        "Authors": "By Priest, John Michael",
        "Description": "On September 13, 1862, in a field near Frederick, Maryland, four Union soldiers hit the jack-pot.  There they found, wrapped carelessly around three cigars, a copy of General Robert E. Lee's most recent orders detailing Southern objectives and letting Union officers know that Lee had split his Army into four vulnerable groups.  General George B. McClellan realized his opportunity to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia one piece at a time.  \"If I cannot whip Bobbie Lee,\" exulted McClellan, \"I will be willing to go home.\"  But the notoriously prudent Union general allowed precious hours to pass, and, by the time he moved, Lee's army had begun to regroup and prepare for battle near Antietam Creek.  The ensuing fight would prove to be not only the bloodiest single day of the entire Civil War, but the bloodiest in the history of the U.S. Army.       Countless historians have analyzed Antietam (known as Sharpsburg in the South) and its aftermath, some concluding that McClellan's failure to vanquish Lee constituted a Southern victory, others that the Confederate retreat into Virginia was a strategic win for the North.  But in Antietam: The Soldiers' Battle, historian John Michael Priest tells this brutal tale of slaughter from an entirely new point of view: that of the common enlisted man. Concentrating on the days of actual battle--September 16, 17, and 18, 1862--Priest vividly brings to life the fear, the horror, and the profound courage that soldiers displayed, from the first Federal cavalry probe of the Confederate lines to the last skirmish on the streets of Sharpsburg.  Antietam is not a book about generals and their grand strategies, but rather concerns men such as the Pennsylvanian corporal who lied to receive the Medal of Honor; the Virginian who lay unattended on the battlefield through most of the second day of fighting, his arm shattered from a Union artillery shell; the Confederate surgeon who wrote to the sweetheart he left behind enemy lines in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania that he had seen so much death and suffering that his \"head had whitened and my very soul turned to stone.\"       Besides being a gripping tale charged with the immediacy of firsthand accounts of the fighting, Antietam also dispels many misconceptions long held by historians and Civil War buffs alike.  Seventy-two detailed maps--which describe the battle in the hourly and quarter-hourly formats established by the Cope Maps of 1904--together with rarely-seen photographs and his own intimate knowledge of the Antietam terrain, allow Priest to offer a substantially new interpretation of what actually happened.        When the last cannon fell silent and the Antietam Creek no longer ran red with Union and Confederate blood, twice as many Americans had been killed in just one day as lost their lives in the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the Spanish-American war combined.  This is a book about battle, but more particularly, about the human dimension in battle.  It asks \"What was it like?\" and while the answers to this simple question by turns horrify and fascinate, they more importantly add a whole new dimension to the study of the American Civil War.",

        "Description": "THE AMERICAN COLONIES WERE IN THE CLUTCHES OF TWO DEADLY STORMS Only months before, the first shot of what would become the American Revolution had been fired. But not everyone was committed to battle. The people were caught between a patriotic fervor for the cause of liberty and deep concern about the righteousness of, and the danger in, rebelling against the world's largest empire. And unbeknowst to them, as September 1775 opened, a powerful hurricane was making its way across the Atlantic, one that would test the colonists' strength, resolve, and faith in the rebellion. Hurricane of Independence is the untold story of a violent storm and the violent birth of a nation. On September 2, 1775, the 8th deadliest Atlantic hurricane of all time landed on American shores. Over the coming days, it would race up the East Coast, striking all of the important colonial capitals and eventually killing more than four thousand people. In an era where hurricanes were viewed as omens from God, what this storm meant to the colonists about the justness of their cause would yield unexpected results.  Hurricane of Independence is the story of the individual people in the eye of the storm and how they saved the American Revolution. From well-known founders like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin to ordinary individuals such as sailors, escaped slaves, farmers, and fishermen, Tony Williams paints a stunning picture of what it meant to live at the opening of the American Revolution and the incredible weight of the choice the people were facing at that deciding moment. Hurricane of Independence brings to life an incredible moment when the forces of nature and the forces of history came together, and the courageous stories of sacrifice, survival, and strength amidst the fight for freedom.",

        "Description": "The Battle of Monocacy, which took place on the blisteringly hot day of July 9, 1864, is one of the Civil War\u2019s most significant yet little-known battles. What played out that day in the corn and wheat fields four miles south of Frederick, Maryland., was a full-field engagement between some 12,000 battle-hardened Confederate troops led by the controversial Jubal Anderson Early, and some 5,800 Union troops, many of them untested in battle, under the mercurial Lew Wallace, the future author of Ben-Hur. When the fighting ended, some 1,300 Union troops were dead, wounded or missing or had been taken prisoner, and Early---who suffered some 800 casualties---had routed Wallace in the northernmost Confederate victory of the war.Two days later, on another brutally hot afternoon, Monday, July 11, 1864, the foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Early sat astride his horse outside the gates of Fort Stevens in the upper northwestern fringe of Washington, D.C. He was about to make one of the war\u2019s most fateful, portentous decisions: whether or not to order his men to invade the nation\u2019s capital.\u00a0 Early had been on the march since June 13, when Robert E. Lee ordered him to take an entire corps of men from their Richmond-area encampment and wreak havoc on Yankee troops in the Shenandoah Valley, then to move north and invade Maryland. If Early found the conditions right, Lee said, he was to take the war for the first time into President Lincoln\u2019s front yard. Also on Lee\u2019s agenda: forcing the Yankees to release a good number of troops from the stranglehold that Gen. U.S. Grant had built around Richmond.Once manned by tens of thousands of experienced troops, Washington\u2019s ring of forts and fortifications that day were in the hands of a ragtag collection of walking wounded Union soldiers, the Veteran Reserve Corps, along with what were known as hundred days\u2019 men---raw recruits who had joined the Union Army to serve as temporary, rear-echelon troops. It was with great shock, then, that the city received news of the impending rebel attack. With near panic filling the streets, Union leaders scrambled to coordinate a force of volunteers.But Early did not pull the trigger. Because his men were exhausted from the fight at Monocacy and the ensuing march, Early paused before attacking the feebly manned Fort Stevens, giving Grant just enough time to bring thousands of veteran troops up from Richmond. The men arrived at the eleventh hour, just as Early was contemplating whether or not to move into Washington. No invasion was launched, but Early did engage Union forces outside Fort Stevens. During the fighting, President Lincoln paid a visit to the fort, becoming the only sitting president in American history to come under fire in a military engagement.Historian Marc Leepson shows that had Early arrived in Washington one day earlier, the ensuing havoc easily could have brought about a different conclusion to the war. Leepson uses a vast amount of primary material, including memoirs, official records, newspaper accounts, diary entries and eyewitness reports in a reader-friendly and engaging description of the events surrounding what became known as \u201cthe Battle That Saved Washington.\u201d \u00a0Praise for Flag: An American Biography\u201cThere is no story about the flag that he omits\u2026.

        "Description": "\u201cUncensored grace is what you get from a loving God when all the religious types have gone home, and every last hope for your own effort has blown up in your face.\u201dWhat comes to mind first when you think \u201cLas Vegas\u201d? Maybe glitz and glam. Or dealers and dancers, high rollers and hell raisers. And why not? After all, the town they call Sin City is an American icon, an anything-goes shrine to pleasure, money, sex\u2013and another lucky roll of the dice.Probably when you think Las Vegas, you don\u2019t think about God or grace.Neither did Jud Wilhite when he was first invited to become the senior pastor at the city\u2019s largest church. But the people he\u2019s met since moving there with his family have changed all that. Today, Vegas stands for something much different and more surprising for Jud. He doesn\u2019t think of Vegas as Sin City anymore. Now, to him, it is Grace City.Working with veteran journalist Bill Taaffe, Jud takes you past the neon and the hype to another side of Vegas\u2013where people whose lives have been marred by loneliness, addiction, and despair are finding hope and freedom in a vital community of faith. Stripped is an account of what happens when ordinary people get honest with each other and an extraordinary God. In its pages you\u2019ll meet gaming industry movers and shakers. You\u2019ll meet working exotic dancers, a Flying Elvis, an American Idol contestant, a cop who won the hearts of a crime-hardened city, and more.Each of them has encountered what Jud calls \u201cuncensored grace.\u201d He writes, \u201cUncensored means that there is no formula or membership or performance that stands between you and God\u2019s goodness.\u201dStripped is their unforgettable account of people who are betting everything on a very big idea: that as wide and deep and high as your mountain of personal ruin might get, God\u2019s transforming grace is always wider and deeper and higher.",
