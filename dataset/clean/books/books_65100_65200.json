        "Description": "The Gambler's Fallacy, the Dirty Hands Argument, Pascal's Wager, Buridan's Ass, Wittgenstein's Beetle in the Box--philosophical terms can be both intriguing and baffling. Now, eminent philosopher Simon Blackburn offers the most authoritative and up-to-date dictionary of philosophy available in a single volume, packed with helpful information for the novice and with astute observations for the expert. Ranging from Aristotle to Zen, the two thousand plus entries cover the entire span of philosophy, from the Vedas (written over three thousand years ago) to the most recent technical terminology, with ample coverage of important themes from Chinese, Indian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophy.  Here are all the terms one would expect to find in a comprehensive dictionary of philosophy--idealism and empiricism, ethics and aesthetics, Epicureanism and Stoicism, deism and pantheism, liberalism and conservatism, existentialism and logical positivism, and much more. Blackburn also defines many terms and concepts not normally found in such reference works, including entries for apathy, Elis (the Greek city which passed a law exempting all philosophers from taxation), laughter, and the meaning of life, and he includes relevant terms from disciplines such as mathematics, physics, biology, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. In addition, there are capsule biographies of nearly five hundred individuals, from the pre-Socratics, to such major figures as Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hobbes, Hegel, Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, to such contemporary figures as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Richard Rorty, Simone de Beauvoir, and Luce Irigaray. Many more women appear here than in other philosophical dictionaries, ranging from Lady Anne Finch Conway, a 17th-century Quaker philosopher and an influence on Leibniz, to Hypatia, an important 4th-century Neoplatonist and mathematician of Alexandria, who was tortured and murdered by Christian Monks at the behest of the patriarch Cyril. And Blackburn also includes figures such as Einstein, Darwin, and Aesop. Finally, Blackburn interjects much of his own personality and wit into these entries. For instance, writing on Francis Bacon, he observes that Bacon's \"legal philosophy was one of absolute duty to the sovereign, which cannot have hindered his rise to the position of Lord Chancellor.\" And he begins his entry on apathy with \"Although it is the particular enemy of teachers and sports coaches, apathy often gets a good philosophical press, especially in ethical systems that regard desire and worldly interest as low and unworthy.\"   A survey of philosophy through the eyes of one of its leading practitioners, The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy is both a handy reference and an intriguing book in which to browse. It is an essential volume for anyone interested in philosophy.",

        "Title": "Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution--And How It Can Renew America",
        "Authors": "By Friedman, Thomas L.",
        "Description": "Thomas L. Friedman's phenomenal number-one bestseller The World Is Flat has helped millions of readers to see the world in a new way. In his brilliant, essential new book, Friedman takes a fresh and provocative look at two of the biggest challenges we face today: America's surprising loss of focus and national purpose since 9/11; and the global environmental crisis, which is affecting everything from food to fuel to forests. In this groundbreaking account of where we stand now, he shows us how the solutions to these two big problems are linked--how we can restore the world and revive America at the same time.Friedman explains how global warming, rapidly growing populations, and the astonishing expansion of the world's middle class through globalization have produced a planet that is \"hot, flat, and crowded.\" Already the earth is being affected in ways that threaten to make it dangerously unstable. In just a few years, it will be too late to fix things--unless the United States steps up now and takes the lead in a worldwide effort to replace our wasteful, inefficient energy practices with a strategy for clean energy, energy efficiency, and conservation that Friedman calls Code Green.This is a great challenge, Friedman explains, but also a great opportunity, and one that America cannot afford to miss. Not only is American leadership the key to the healing of the earth; it is also our best strategy for the renewal of America.In vivid, entertaining chapters, Friedman makes it clear that the green revolution we need is like no revolution the world has seen. It will be the biggest innovation project in American history; it will be hard, not easy; and it will change everything from what you put into your car to what you see on your electric bill. But the payoff for America will be more than just cleaner air. It will inspire Americans to something we haven't seen in a long time--nation-building in America--by summoning the intelligence, creativity, boldness, and concern for the common good that are our nation's greatest natural resources.Hot, Flat, and Crowded is classic Thomas L. Friedman: fearless, incisive, forward-looking, and rich in surprising common sense about the challenge--and the promise--of the future.",

But they've never caught Paul Hoehler, the maverick who invented the technology, and who has been working quietly for decades to develop a way to defeat the Authority. With the help of an underground network of determined, independent scientists and a teenager who may be the apprentice genius he's needed for so long, he will shake the world, in the fast-paced hard-science thriller that garnered Vinge the first of his four Hugo nominations for best novel.",

Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness.Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. My Sister's Keeper examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person.  Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you? Once again, in My Sister's Keeper, Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity.",

And the one who seems to be hurting the most is her own mother, who lost a baby a year earlier. Daisy is filled with sorrow inside because her mother, who used to sing and laugh and talk about God, no longer does any of those things. Now she spends her days silent and resigned. So the little girl decides what her town needs is a church, to touch their hearts and spirits, to remind them that God is there, and that His angels are watching over them all. Daisy dreams up a play entitled Come, My Little Angel, and recruits her classmates to play the roles and her beloved music teacher to provide the music. Despite the obstacles working against her, Daisy perseveres, even when her own faith is shaken, until she finds herself face to face with a miracle -straight from the hand of a God who longs to restore us to joy and singing. And when, at the end of the book, you see what God does for this little girl - and for the mother she loves so deeply - you come away knowing nothing - not one single thing - is impossible with God.",

She was living deep within what she calls the Middle Place--\"that sliver of time when parenthood and childhood overlap\"--comfortably wedged between her adult duties and her parents' care. But Kelly is abruptly shoved into coming-of-age when she finds a lump in her breast--and gets the diagnosis no one wants to hear. When George, too, learns that he has late-stage cancer, it is Kelly's turn to take care of the man who had always taken care of her--and to show us a woman who finally takes the leap and grows up.",

        "Description": "Barely a century old, silk screen printing or serigraphy has been adopted as a commercial and an artistic process by thousands of enthusiastic professional and amateur crafters throughout the world. In this volume, one of silkscreen's foremost teachers and practitioners explains the entire process from the construction of the frame to the moment of printing your first impression. You are shown how to select or assemble every piece of equipment needed: the frame that holds the silk, the fabric and its attachment to the frame, the base on which the print will rest, stencil knives, guides, the squeegee that forces the paint through the silk, drying racks, and other items.All five of the most general and useful techniques with respect to stencils are described: the paper stencil method, the block-out method, the Tusche stencil method, the film stencil method, and the photographic stencil method. Step-by-step instructions detail each technique. Chapters on multi-color silkscreening and color matching and blending make it possible for anyone to produce fine, well-registered prints. In fact, you can use this book as a complete-to-the-last-detail home course for almost every facet of this important modern art form.A special section covers common difficulties and shows you how to reduce or eliminate them. Ninety-six detailed figures cover every step in the process, and 45 plates illustrate work by such renowned artists as Philip Hicken, Harry Schokler, W. Colescott, Riva Helfond, Anthony Velonis, Amelia Hammer, Ray Euffa, and many others who have exhibited at the National Serigraph Society and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",

        "Title": "The New Mystery: The International Association of Crime Writers' Essential Crime Writing of the Late 20th Century",
        "Authors": "By Charyn, Jerome (EDT)",
        "Description": "In the last decade of this century, crime writing has become a true international language, bringing forth the world's best literary talents to create a fictional mirror of our fears, our need for justice - or revenge - and our violent world. Since 1987, the members of the International Association of Crime Writers have created a multinational \"brotherhood and sisterhood of crime\" to articulate a vision that the forty-two chilling stories in this definitive collection represent - fiction that pushes the genre of crime writing beyond its old limits to create a genuine literature for the modern age.James Ellroy, Paco Ignacio Taibo II, Andrew Vachss, and Didier Daeninckx, creators of stories that surpass the mere hard edge to depict a bloody, pitiless world of criminals and avengers, show us a violent urban no-man's land where the real danger is the loss of our souls.Sue Grafton uses her PI Kinsey Millhone to balance the scales of justice in the shotgun killing of a cocaine dealer when the authorities can't, or won't; Sara Paretsky brings back Philip Marlowe to solve a classic California case of double murder in a brilliant homage to Raymond Chandler.Clarice Lispector shows us the terrible tricks of a young English teacher protecting herself from rapists on a train ride to Rio; Don DeLillo slices close to the bone when he presents a sympathetic picture of a young Lee Harvey Oswald, and so does Lawrence Block when he uses the victims of AIDS to pose a conundrum about the ethics of dying... and murder. All forty-two stories in this extraordinary gathering of the \"new mystery\" represent crime writing that no longer follows the rules of yesterday's cozies and detective fiction. There is evil here, but no sanitized murders off stage or in locked rooms. There is disturbingly realistic violence, but no aloof, emotionless paragons of deduction. Instead, The New Mystery gives us vigorous, stunning tales, often ironic or deeply cynical and undeniably alive. By bringing us many original or previously uncollected stories by today's best crime writers, this volume is a milestone in mystery fiction - and riveting entertainment for every fan of the genre.",

Incumbent politicians control thousands of election practices and bureaucratic hurdles that determine who votes and how their votes are counted, including the location of election-district boundaries, the number of booths at urban polling places, and English-only ballots. Spencer Overton uses real-life stories to show how these seemingly insignificant practices channel political power and determine policies on war, schools, clean air, and other issues that shape our lives. He exposes the pressure points in this Orwellian system and provides strategies toward restoring self-government, including removing redistricting power from self-interested partisans and renewing parts of the Voting Rights Act that expire in 2007. Overton's compelling case is vital to the future of our democracy.",

        "Description": "In her latest thriller, New York Times bestselling author Tami Hoag takes readers on a suspense-filled ride of shocks and twists leading to an explosive finish. It is the story of an ex-cop, a missing girl, and a killer locked in a race where there can be only one winner\u2014and the losers die trying. In a trailer in a Florida swamp, time is running out for eighteen year-old Erin Seabright. A pawn in a kidnapper's terrifying game for a ransom no one can pay, her last hope is a washed-up ex-cop who has already lost it all-not once, but twice.The wealthy world of the Palm Beach horse set seems a long way from a cop's world in the narcotics division. A lifetime ago, undercover sheriff's detective Elena Estes worked the mean streets and BackTop alleys, living by her wits and playing the long odds until she took one risk too many. Now Estes lives on the ragged edge of lost hope and self-hatred, hiding from the past and believing she doesn't deserve to have a future. But the past is about to come back with a vengeance, and the future is about to become a race between life and death.A young woman is missing and her twelve year-old stepsister comes to Estes for help. No one but serious, studious Molly Seabright seems concerned about what's happened to her troubled older sister. But Molly is convinced Erin is in danger. Estes has no P.I. license, no interest in a new career, and no desire to break her self-imposed exile. But the more she learns about the people Erin Seabright was involved with, the more her long-dormant cop instincts come back to life.One trip to the show grounds where Erin worked as a groom, and Estes is quickly pulled to the dark side of a glamorous sport. Behind the glittering, ultra-rich facade is an ultra-ruthless world of drugs, payoffs, and dirty deals. A world of dissolute playboys and crooked horse-dealers, of royalty and rabble, of rivals and enemies. An obscenely wealthy world where anything can be had for a price\u2014including a life.And in that world stalks a killer who will lead Estes down a dark, twisted trail of decadence and deceit, mayhem and murder\u2014from the gilded life of Palm Beach to the darkest corners of the Florida swamps, to a final show-down that could cost her everything. A race against time and evil. A race in which Estes is the dark horse\u2014and no one is betting on her to win.",

        "Authors": "By Erickson, Carolly",
        "Description": "In 1804, when Josephine Bonaparte knelt before her husband, Napoleon, to receive the imperial diadem, few in the vast crowd of onlookers were aware of the dark secrets hidden behind the imperial fa\u00e7ade. To her subjects, she appeared to vet hew most favored woman in France: alluring, wealthy, and with the devoted love of a remarkable husband who was the conqueror of Europe. In actuality, Josephine's life was far darker, for her celebrated allure was fading, her wealth was compromised by massive debt, and her marriage was corroded by infidelity and abuse.Josephine's life story was as turbulent as the age-an era of revolution and social upheaval, of the guillotine, and of frenzied hedonism. With telling psychological depth and compelling literary grace, Carolly Erickson brings the complex, charming, ever-resilient Josephine to life in this memorable portrait, one that carries the reader along every twist and turn of the empress's often thorny path, from the sensual richness of her childhood in the tropics to her final lonely days at Malmaison.",

But the evidence proves otherwise.When a state trooper named Caxton calls the FBI looking for help in the middle of the night, it is Arkeley who gets the assignment-who else? He\u2019s been expecting such a call to come eventually. Sure, it has been years since any signs of an attack, but Arkeley knows what most people don\u2019t: there is one left. In an abandoned asylum she is rotting, plotting, and biding her time in a way that only the undead can.Caxton is out of her league on this case and more than a little afraid, but the fed made it plain that there is only one way out. But the worst thing is the feeling that the vampires want more than just her blood. They want her for a reason, one she can\u2019t guess; a reason her sphinxlike partner knows but won\u2019t say; a reason she has to find out-or die trying.Now there are only 13 bullets between Caxton and Arkeley and the vampires. There are only13 bullets between us, the living, and them, the damned.",

While the TV news crews feasted on the scene an Alex began his therapy sessions with the traumatized children, he couldn't escape the image of a slight teenager clutching an oversized rifle. What was the identity behind the name and face: a would-be assassin, or just another victim beneath an indifferent California sky?Intrigued by a request from the sniper's father to conduct a \"psychological autopsy\" of his child, Alex begins to uncover a strange pattern of innocence, neglect, and loss. Then suddenly it is more than a pattern -- it is a trail of blood. In the dead sniper's past was a dark and vicious plot. And in Alex Delaware's future is the stuff of grown-up nightmares: the face of real human evil.Also available on BDD Audio Cassette.",
