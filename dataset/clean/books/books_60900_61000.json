And when all these identities collide -- as they do most days -- the results are always unpredictable.Sammy's role as an advisor to Vice President Robert Gary (RG for short) has led her down some exciting professional paths, like when she accompanies RG on a trip to India to help open pharmaceutical supply lines, and some troubling ones -- like when the president secretly asks her to plumb those lines to acquire as yet unapproved drugs for his own personal use.

        "Title": "The Origin of Modern Humans (Scientific American Library)",
        "Authors": "By Lewin, Roger",
        "Description": "Where and when did modern humans (Homo sapiens) first appear? Who were our immediate evolutionary ancestors? What features distinguish modern humans and how did these features arise? These questions have gripped the scientific community and the public since the mid-nineteenth century, when the discovery of Neanderthal Man and the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species rocked the foundations of long-held beliefs on the subject.Many new findings, speculations, and reevaluations have sharpened our views of modern human origins since then. Nevertheless, the controversy continues, as the patchy fossil record and new evidence derived from genetic techniques have given rise to competing theories. Are we the result of a single uninterrupted lineage, with each distinct species of human leading directly to the next? Or, do species such as the Neanderthal represent offshoots of an evolutionary tree that died out without leaving successors? Did modern humanity arise roughly contemporaneously in different parts of the world or from a single species in a single location? And how do biological, linguistic, artistic, and technological factors distinguish Homo sapiens from near and distant relatives? At stake in the argument is nothing less than the very definition of what it means, biologically and culturally, to be human.In this vividly written volume, award-winning science author Roger Lewin describes the discoveries, the intellectual clashes, and the often conflicting interpretations of evidence that have shaped the current debate on modern humanity's origin. Readers will learn of astonishing findings (the original Neanderthal bones, and provocative theories (the genetically-derived speculation that we are all the children of a single African female who lived about 200,000 years ago), as well as one preposterous hoax (the Piltdown Man). Readers will also see the evolution of the modern science of paleoanthropology, which brings molecular biology, genetics, population biology, linguistics, and other disciplines into the search for the distinctive stamp of Homo sapiens in artifacts and skeletal remains.",

But after so many adrenaline-soaked years of risking his life, Bourne finds himself chafing under the quiet life of a linguistics professor.  Aware of his frustrations, his academic mentor, Professor Specter, asks for help investigating the murder of a former student by a previously unknown Muslim extremist sect. The young man died carrying information about the group's terrorist activities, including an immediate plan to attack the United States.  The organization, the Black Legion, and its lethal plot have also popped up on the radar of Central Intelligence, where new director Veronica Hart is struggling to assert her authority. Sensing an opportunity to take control of CI by showing Hart's incompetence, National Security Agency operatives plan to accomplish what CI never could-hunt down and kill Bourne.  In Europe, Bourne's investigation into the Black Legion turns into one of the deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life-the pursuit of the leader of a murderous terrorist group with roots in the darkest days of World War II-all while an assassin as brilliant and damaged as himself is getting closer by the minute . . .",

        "Authors": "By Phillips, Christi",
        "Description": "In this captivating debut, Christi Phillips blends fact and fiction, suspense and sensuality into a vibrant, richly imagined novel in which a modern historian uncovers a courtesan's secret role in a shocking conspiracy of seventeenth-century Venice.   Claire Donovan always dreamed of visiting Venice, though not as a chaperone for a surly teenager. But she can't pass up this chance to complete her Ph.D. thesis on Alessandra Rossetti, a mysterious courtesan who wrote a secret letter to the Venetian Council warning of a Spanish plot to overthrow the Venetian Republic in 1618. Claire views Alessandra as a heroine and harbors a secret hope that her findings will elevate Alessandra to a more prominent place in history. But an arrogant Cambridge professor is set to present a paper at a prestigious Venetian university denouncing Alessandra as a co-conspirator -- a move that could destroy Claire's paper and career.   As Claire races to locate the documents that will reveal the courtesan's true motives, Alessandra's story comes to life with all the sensuality, political treachery, and violence of seventeenth-century Venice. Claire also falls under the city's spell. She is courted by a handsome Italian, matches wits with her academic adversary, bonds with her troubled young charge, and, amid the boundless beauty of Venice, recaptures the joy of living every moment....   Layering wit and warmth into her portraits of two very different yet equally dynamic heroines, Christi Phillips shifts effortlessly between past and present in a remarkable novel that is at once a love story, a mystery, and an intriguing historical drama. Filled with beautifully rendered details of one of the world's oldest and most magical cities, The Rossetti Letter marks Phillips's debut as a writer of extraordinary skill and grace.",

        "Title": "The Priest: A Gothic Romance",
        "Authors": "By Disch, Thomas M.",
        "Description": "Since his work first began to appear in the early 1960s, Thomas Disch has proven himself, again and again, to be one of the most prodigiously talented novelist/playwright/poets of our time. In Newsweek he was saluted by Walter Clemons as \"the most formidably gifted unfamous American writer.\" But in 1991, with the publication of The M.D., Disch's remarkably various gifts converged in a horror novel that propelled him into the mainstream even as it remade the genre in its own startling image. Now, in The Priest, Disch gives us an even more potent, darkly hypnotic, and fiendishly comic novel - a gothic romance like no other.At the center: Father Patrick Bryce, a Catholic priest with a present-day Minneapolis parish - and a pedophile past. He's spent time at a church-run retreat for priests of his persuasion and returned \"rehabilitated\": even better equipped to keep his vice active and hidden.Until the blackmail begins.It comes from three different sources (his own bishop being one), and each tops the next in imaginative proposals: Father Pat must head a militant (and probably illegal) anti-abortion campaign; Father Pat must apologize to each of his victims, face-to-face; Father Pat must read, and be ready to discuss, the work of a bizarre cult science fiction writer, and get the face of Satan tattooed on his chest. But the blackmailers and their demands are the least of Father Pat's problems. More dire is his increasingly incontrovertible sense that the nightmares in which he has been leading the life of a thirteenth-century bishop are not dreams at all. And that the Church, rife with corruption and scandal in both eras, is the only realistic sanctuary for him and his doppelganger, Bishop Silvanus de Roquefort, as they move - at once separately and together - through their own centuries-spanning maze of soul-killing horrors toward a distinctly hellish destiny. The astonishments, mayhem, and villainy they encounter along the way come brilliantly to life in an eerie and wildly populated narrative that builds at breakneck speed to its gripping, gruesome, and romantic finale.The Priest is a spellbinding confirmation of Thomas Disch's standing as a master conjurer of the most darkly compelling tales.",

        "Authors": "By Cockburn, Andrew, Garrett, Kenneth (PHT), and Brooks, Geraldine (FRW)",
        "Description": "It was Abraham Lincoln, in his immortal Gettysburg Address, who first used the words \"hallowed ground\" to describe the woods and fields, the rolling hills and plashing creeks where two great armies - both American - had so recently fought and died. Although the battle his eloquence commemorated was indeed a pivotal event in our country's history, the landscape where it was waged and the region that surrounded it had already been hallowed ground for generations.Stretching from Pennsylvania through Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, this extraordinary tract of land set the stage for our national chronicle and served as backdrop to transformational American events, such as Captain John Smith's adventures in Monacan territory in the early 1600s and Gen. George Pickett's gallant, doomed charge at Gettysburg in 1863. It has given us Founding Fathers like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson; heroic figures like Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross; and models of dignity such as Gen. Robert E. Lee, who fought for his native South despite his stand against slavery. Its maps are a catalog of historical sites, from key battlefields of the American Revolution and the Civil War to the first U.S. meeting site of W. E. B. Du Bois's Niagara Movement.Illustrated with dozens of stunning modern photographs as well as evocative artifacts that summon earlier eras and aspirations, this is a book to delight travelers, U.S. history buffs, and anyone else who seeks to capture the enduring spirit and tradition of this hallowed ground. This is the birthplace of the American ideal as it has developed from unexplored wilderness to a vital artery of the American experience.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy (Oxford Illustrated Histories)",
        "Authors": "By Cannon, John and Griffiths, Ralph Alan",
        "Description": "The rich pageant of Britain's history emerges nowhere more colorfully than in the story of its kings and queens.  This spectacular book offers the most authoritative account of the British monarchy ever published for the general reader. With over 400 illustrations--a third of them in color--it traces the crown's full history from Anglo-Saxon times to the present.      The authors present a vivid picture of the lives of individual monarchs as well as of the monarchy as a political and social force.  They begin the story in the fifth century with the rise of recognizable kingdoms in Scotland, Wales, and England and conclude with a discussion of the crown's constitutional role, which emerged in Queen Victoria's reign, and how this has affected the symbolic and popular monarchy of today.  Along the way, we gain a clear view of how key traditions evolved:  the right of succession, coronations and marriages, oaths of loyalty and military service, the granting of lands and titles, and the propagation of a powerful image of royalty.      The book not only explains the monarch's political struggles and styles of governing; it is filled with fascinating details that give the story life.  We learn, for instance, that Elizabeth I's famous journeys to various corners of her realm were not simply to show her off to her subjects: \"The standard of Tudor sanitation,\" the authors note, \"meant that the royal palaces became unbearable after several weeks of occupation and the court's absence for several months in the summer gave an opportunity to clean up.\"  We discover that Victoria's coronation was \"a splendid mixture of majesty and muddle\":  when it came time for the Archbishop to bestow the ceremonial ring, the already befuddled cleric placed it on the Queen's wrong finger, \"causing considerable delay [and] some pain.\"  And we read George VI's touching wedding message to his daughter (the present queen):  \"Your leaving us has left a great blank in our lives but do remember that your old home is still yours.\"      Supporting the text and carefully selected pictures are sidebars on each of the monarchs and on key general themes; color maps; an illustrated section on royal residences and tombs; a consolidated list of monarchs; genealogies; annotated lists of further reading; and a full index with personal dates.",

Now Taylor returns to the colorful Northern Ireland community of Ballybucklebo, where there's always something brewing beneath the village's deceptively sleepy surface.Young Doctor Barry Laverty has only just begun his assistantship under his eccentric mentor, Dr. Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly, but he already feels right at home in Ballybucklebo. When the sudden death of a patient casts a cloud over Barry's reputation, his chances of establishing himself in the village are endangered, especially since the grieving widow is threatening a lawsuit. While he anxiously waits for the postmortem results that he prays will exonerate him, Barry must regain the trust of the gossipy Ulster village, one patient at a time. From a put-upon shop girl with a mysterious rash to the troubled pregnancy of a winsome young lass who's not quite married yet, Ballybucklebo provides plenty of cases to keep the two country G.P.s busy.Not all their challenges are medical in nature. When a greedy developer sets his sights on the very heart of the community, the village pub, it's up to the doctors to save the Black Swan (affectionately known to the locals as the \"Mucky Duck\") from being turned into an overpriced tourist trap. After all, the good citizens of Ballybucklebo need some place to drink to each other's health. . . .Whether you've visited in the past, or are discovering Ballybucklebo for the first time, An Irish Country Village is an ideal location for anyone looking for wit, warmth, and just a touch of blarney.",

Now it is updated and presented in a revised and expanded edition, with a new chapter on relapse.

Here food addiction is defined, trigger foods are identified and consequences of food addiction are revealed. A lifetime eating plan demonstrating how to stick with a healthful food plan for the long term is also provided. \"For some people, foods can be as addictive as alcohol,\" Kay Sheppard explains. \"Gummy bears and marshmallow chicks can be vicious killers whose effects can lead to depression, irritability and even suicide. The terrible truth is that for certain individuals, refined carbohydrates can trigger the addictive process. This book is an effort to help you understand and solve the problems of compulsive eating.\"",

For these two teenagers - brother and sister, black and white - the 1980's were a trial by fire.In this memoir, Scheeres takes us from the familiar Midwest, a land of cottonwood trees and trailer parks, to a place beyond her imagining. At home, the Scheeres kids must endure the usual trials of adolescence - high-school hormones, incessant bullying, and the deep-seated restlessness of social misfits everywhere - under the shadow of virulent racism neither knows how to contend with. When they start to crack (or fight back), they are packed off to Escuela Caribe.This brutal, prison-like \"Christian boot camp\" demands that its inhabitants repent for their sins - sins that few of them are aware of having committed. Julia and David's determination to make it though with heart and soul intact is told here with immediacy, candor, sparkling humor, and not an ounce of malice. Jesus Land is, on every page, a keenly moving ode to the sustaining power of love, and rebellion, and the dream of a perfect family.",

        "Description": "Is violence a virus? Can your genes make you a killer? Why are we so willing to hurt each other? In The Babel Effect, the husband-and-wife research team of Ryan and Jessamine McCloud are charged with answering these urgent questions. Beginning as a neurological study of murderers on death row, their research explodes into an investigation into the biomedical foundations of human history. The quest takes them from prison cells to research labs to war zones throughout the world and forces them to doubt their most basic assumptions about the human species, about themselves, and about their marriage.Combining systems theory with modern epidemiology, they soon learn that our propensity for violence resembles a contagious disease. But is the human carnage of the last hundred years an ancient plague or a new nightmare? Can they identify the cause and find a cure? As their discoveries reveal frightening secrets about multinational corporations, clandestine military programs, and millennial religious cults, they realize that finding the answers depends on a still more urgent and terrifying question: Can they survive the search?When an unknown enemy steals their data and abducts Jessamine, the FBI investigation stalls, and Ryan realizes that it is up to him alone to find his pregnant wife. He soon finds that to learn where she is, he must discover who she is - and confront the question of whether we can ever really know the one we love.",

        "Description": "Jesse and Frank James were household names long before images of America's most wanted were televised. For several decades after the Civil War, they were hunted by hundreds who supposed them to be involved in every bank and train robbery in the Midwest. Trained as guerrilla fighters in the border conflict between Kansas and Missouri, they joined with the Younger brothers in February 1866 to rob a bank in Liberty, Missouri. That was the beginning of a criminal confederation that seemed beyond the reach of the law until the Northfield, Minnesota, raid killed three of them and sent the James brothers into hiding. But they were the objects of posted rewards that proved too tempting in Jesse's case: in 1882 he was shot in the back by Robert Ford of his own gang. The Rise and Fall of Jesse James, by Robertus Love, a newspaperman who knew Frank James, is a pioneering work that plumbs the personalities of the outlaws, looks at their domestic lives, cites many stories about them, and attempts to separate fact from legend in tracking their violent operations.Michael Fellman assesses Love's 1926 book in his introduction to this Bison Books edition.",
