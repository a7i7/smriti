        "Description": "This Spanish grammar has been designed specifically for the adult with limited learning time. It covers the most important points of Spanish grammar in the clearest possible way, concentrating on the expressions that you would be most likely to use. All rules are illustrated with common phrases, and hints are included throughout the book on how to replace difficult constructions with simpler ones.All the major aspects of Spanish grammar are presented in logical order: vocabulary and vocabulary building; word order;  how to turn a positive sentence into a negative one; how to form questions; nouns; pronouns; adjectives; adverbs; how to conjugate verbs in the major tenses; how to use auxiliary verbs; prepositions and infinitives; useful expressions; and vocabulary tips. One section is devoted to the definition of all grammatical terms used throughout the book.Not a simplified grammar, this is a selected grammar for adult use. It can be used alone, either as an introductory course or as a refresher, or as a supplement to a record course. Its cognate list of more than 2500 words which are either the same or nearly the same in Spanish and English offers probably the easiest way for you to build your vocabulary, for you will discover that you have already been using very many words that with a slight change in pronunciation are already good Spanish. This is the only place where this useful teaching device is available.",

And now a new danger had arisen to threaten the peace of Ehlana's realm.The trouble had started quietly. At home, bandits began to plague the hill country. In neighboring Lamorkand, the customary political unrest turned ominous with whispers that the bloody heroes of old soon would rise again. And travelers reported that the Trolls had all disappeared from the icy northern haunts of Thalesia.Simple problems, apparently unrelated - until an ambassador arrived from the far-off Tamul empire, begging Sparhawk's aid. For these same dangers that stalked Ehlana's kingdom had already struck his realm full-force. The fabled ancient warriors of Tamuli had indeed returned - intent on carnage. Monsters and fell magics had followed, and the havoc and terror they spawned were tearing the empire apart.The empire had sent for the Pandion Knight who had killed the God Azash. If Sparhawk wanted to stop this danger before it could savage his own land, he now must lend his aid.Sparhawk, Ehlana, and their daughter, Princess Danae, agreed to make the grueling trek to the far-distant empire of the east. They traveled in company with a handful of trusted companions: the stalwart champions of the four Militant Orders, the knight Berit, Mirtai the giantess, and the young thief Talen.With the child-goddess Aphrael to speed their journey, they began the treacherous traverse of the utmost reaches of the Daresian continent, to Tamul's distant capital. There, in the emperor's glittering court, they would encounter corruption, treachery - and a greater danger than any man had faced before!David Eddings opens a bold new chapter in the saga begun in his bestselling series, The Elenium. In his dazzling trademark style, Eddings weaves a compelling tale of strange magic and breathtaking adventure, staunch friends and deadly enemies. Domes of Fire is a triumph of sheer story-telling magic from fantasy's premier genius!",

She kisses the bruises and scrapes and fevered forehead, and makes them better. She stands up for you at school, but brooks no nonsense when it's time to do homework. She cuts out of meetings to see you play soccer, and tells you a joke after the game you lost. And while Dad says you look perfect no matter what, Mom gives it to you straight--including when you really are perfect. The relationship between a mother and child is as honest as it is loving as it is pragmatic as it is forever.Stuart Hample, who has been listening to and writing down the words of children for years and years, presents his newest collection of gems--dozens of reflections, appreciations, misgivings, and accolades from kids about their moms. Co-editor of Children's Letters to God, with over 1 million copies in print, and, most recently, Me and My Dad, Mr. Hample has perfect pitch when it comes to hearing what children say: \"When I wanted a sister she took that into consideration. So now I have one.\" --Flora\"My mom says whoever took out the garbage without being asked I am very proud of you.\" --Andy\"She says yes when she needs to say yes, and says no when she needs to say no. But I don't like to get kissed first thing in the morning.\" --Vanessa \"She may not be perfect but I think she's as close to it as a mom can get.\" --Lola",

        "Title": "F.I.A.S.C.O.: Blood in the Water on Wall Street",
        "Authors": "By Partnoy, Frank",
        "Description": "In F.I.A.S.C.O.: Blood in the Water on Wall Street, a former derivatives salesman takes readers onto the trading floor of a leading investment bank\u2014and in a tell-all, no-holds-barred expos\u00e9, reveals for the first time the ugly truth about these complex financial products and the people who peddle them. Writing with the same eye for telling details as Michael Lewis in Liar\u2019s Poker, Frank Partnoy shows how the once genteel world of investment banking has now become a place where the rallying cry is \"There\u2019s blood in the water. Let\u2019s go kill someone.\"Partnoy was in his late twenties when he landed the job of his dreams\u2014a position in Morgan Stanley\u2019s Derivatives Products Group, the single most profitable division of the venerable investment bank. With vivid character sketches and a wealth of funny-yet-disturbing anecdotes, Partnoy takes us inside the culture of Morgan Stanley\u2019s derivatives group. Encouraged by upper management and egged on by gun-toting senior salesmen, derivatives had become a business-as-war, take-no-prisoners operation where people pored over Soldier of Fortune and gloated when they sold a product that \"ripped off\" a client\u2019s face.As he leads us through the ups and downs of his fifteen months at Morgan Stanley, Partnoy explains in plain English what derivatives are\u2014and shows how he and the other \"rocket scientists\" at the bank custom-designed these arcane financial products to dodge government regulators, encourage foreign currency speculation by pension and mutual funds, disguise risky gambles with AAA Standard & Poor\u2019s ratings, and avoid capital gains taxes for weathy individuals. He also details, for the first time, the deal that earned Morgan Stanley the fattest fee in Wall Street history\u2014a $74.5 million profit for devising a derivative that wiped hundreds of millions in losses off a Japanese company\u2019s balance sheet.But dreaming up ever more complicated derivatives products\u2014Dollarized Yield Curve Notes, Constant Maturity Treasury Floaters, Trigger Notes, and Total Return Swaps, to name a few\u2014was never enough. For the bank to earn its fee, they had to be sold\u2014usually, as Partnoy notes, either to \"cheaters\" (fund managers who wanted riskier investments than their regulators or charters normally allowed) or to \"widows and orphans\" (unsophisticated fund managers who couldn\u2019t understand the risks in fine print).Throughout the book, Partnoy gives us a trading-floor view of the disasters fueled by derivatives trading and provides the formula of greed, daring, and ingenuity that are the basic ingredients of all derivatives. Written with humor, insight, and a mounting sense of moral outrage, F.I.A.S.C.O. is both a brilliant insider\u2019s account of investment banking today and a blistering indictment of the largely unregulated market in derivatives\u2014a book that everyone who has a pension plan or invests in mutual funds needs to read.",

        "Description": "The Cold War may be over, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the tens of thousands of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction still held by Russia, the United States, and other world powers. Arguing that the time has come to dispense with incremental approaches to arms control, Admiral Stansfield Turner, the former head of the CIA and an experienced senior military commander, proposes a practical yet safe plan that would move the world into a new and secure millennium.Turner carefully analyzes how many nuclear weapons are really needed to maintain our national security, regardless of how many weapons of mass destruction other nations may have. He then offers a dramatic, unilateral American initiative\u2014to place all the world\u2019s nuclear warheads in \u201cstrategic escrow\u201d whereby none would be ready for immediate use; to initiate a pledge of \u201cno first use\u201d and call on other nations to do the same; and to build national defenses against nuclear attack when they become cost-effective.The paperback edition of this widely acclaimed work has been updated to consider the implications of such a build down if applied to non-nuclear weapons of mass destruction. Specifically, Admiral Turner details how a plan for weapons reduction could be carried out for biological and chemical weapons and what tactical and strategic differences exist between de-escalation of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons.The Turner Plan achieves genuine international security and has the potential to achieve wide, bipartisan support. It deserves to be widely studied, debated, and, finally, implemented.",

        "Description": "A highly distilled form of Japanese poetry, haiku consists of seventeen syllables, usually divided among three lines. Though brief, they tell a story or paint a vivid picture, leaving it to the reader to draw out the meanings and complete them in the mind's eye. Haiku often contains a hidden dualism (near and far, then and now, etc.) and has a seasonal tie-in, as well as specific word-images that reveal deeper layers in each poem.This unique collection spans over 400 years (1488\u20131902) of haiku history by the greatest masters: Bash\u014d, Issa, Shiki, and many more, in translations by top-flight scholars in the field. Haiku commands enormous respect in Japan. Now readers of poetry in the West can savor these expressive masterpieces in this treasury compiled by noted writer Faubion Bowers, who provides a Foreword and many informative notes to the poems.",

Witty, compassionate, and wry, it captures the social, political, and spiritual upheavals of those decades through the experiences of a middle-class couple, their four children, and the changing worlds in which they live. While Michael and Annie Keane taste the alternately intoxicating and bitter first fruits of the sexual revolution, their older, more tentative brother, Jacob, lags behind, until he finds himself on the way to Vietnam. Meanwhile, Clare, the youngest child of their aging parents, seeks to maintain an almost saintly innocence. After This, alive with the passions and tragedies of a determining era in our history, portrays the clash of traditional, faith-bound life and modern freedom, while also capturing, with McDermott's inimitable understanding and grace, the joy, sorrow, anger, and love that underpin, and undermine, what it is to be a family.",

Every day we are faced with fridge wars, bad mirror moments, diets that don't work, skinny friends who can eat whatever they like, and husbands who reminisce about the size 8 they married. Yet victory can be yours. Increasingly, scientific studies are indicating that in health matters, prayer works--and in The Dieter's Prayer Book, you'll find that daily ounce of spiritual encouragement you need. Not tied to any one particular diet, The Dieter's Prayer Book can be used in conjunction with any healthy-eating program, or on its own.

        "Description": "In her 38th bestselling novel, Danielle Steel creates a powerful, moving portrayal of families divided, lives shattered and a nation torn apart by prejudice during a shameful episode in recent American history.A man ahead of his time, Japanese college professor Masao Takashimaya of Kyoto had a passion for modern ideas that was as strong as his wife's belief in ancient traditions. It was the early 1920s and Masao had dreams for the future--and a fascination with the politics and opportunities of a world that was changing every day. Twenty years later, his eighteen-year-old daughter Hiroko, torn between her mother's traditions and her father's wishes, boarded the SS Nagoya Mare to come to California for an education and to make her father proud. It was August 1941.From the ship, she went directly to the Palo Alto home of her uncle, Takeo, and his family. To Hiroko, California was a different world--a world of barbeques, station wagons and college. Her cousins in California had become more American than Japanese. And much to Hiroko's surprise, Peter Jenkins, her uncle's assistant at Stanford, became an unexpected link between her old world and her new. But in spite of him, and all her promises to her father, Hiroko longs to go home. At college in Berkeley, her world is rapidly and unexpectedly filled with prejudice and fear.On December 7, Pearl Harbor is bombed by the Japanese. Within hours, war is declared and suddenly Hiroko has become an enemy in a foreign land. Terrified, begging to go home, she is nonetheless ordered by her father to stay. He is positive she will be safer in California than at home, and for a brief time she is--until her entire world caves in.On February 19, Executive Order 9066 is signed by President Roosevelt, giving the military the power to remove the Japanese from their communities at will. Takeo and his family are given ten days to sell their home, give up their jobs, and report to a relocation center, along with thousands of other Japanese and Japanese Americans, to face their destinies there. Families are divided, people are forced to abandon their homes, their businesses, their freedom, and their lives. Hiroko and her uncle's family go first to Tanforan, and from there to the detention center at Tule Lake. This extraordinary novel tells what happened to them there, creating a portrait of human tragedy and strength, divided loyalties and love. It tells of Americans who were treated as foreigners in their own land. And it tells Hiroko's story, and that of her American family, as they fight to stay alive amid the drama of life and death in the camp at Tule Lake.With clear, powerful prose, Danielle Steel portrays not only the human cost of that terrible time in history, but also the remarkable courage of a people whose honor and dignity transcended the chaos that surrounded them. Set against a vivid backdrop of war and change, her thirty-eighth bestselling novel is both living history and outstanding fiction, revealing the stark truth about the betrayal of Americans by their own government...and the triumph of a woman caught between cultures and determined to survive.",

But McNally's Caper is real-life, real-death family meshugass. The clan in question bears the proud name Forsythe, but the devious saga played out within the fortresslike walls of their baronial estate is far too raw ever to make it to Masterpiece Theatre.Called in by patriarch Griswold Forsythe II - a client of Archy's father, who even the closemouthed senior McNally admits is pretty dull - our happy-go-lucky sleuth commences a covert search to discover which intimate relative is lifting the family valuables piece by piece.Before he solves that puzzle, Archy's in for a sordid rainbow of surprises that gives the lie to the dynasty's colorless repute. First there are the steamy Forsythe females hurling themselves his way. Then the buried scandals that keep bubbling up wherever he looks. But not until the murder of pater-familias do things finally boil over - into a white-hot crucible of corruption that menaces the guilty and the innocent alike.Mixing suspense, sensuality and high jinks with a Cordon Bleu chef's expertise, Lawrence Sanders' McNally's Caper is a thoroughly delectable read.",

Citing diverse examples from around the globe, Netanyahu demonstrates that domestic terrorist groups are usually no match for an advanced technological society which can successfully roll back terror without any significant curtailment of civil liberties. But Netanyahu sees an even more potent threat from the new international terrorism which is increasingly the product of Islamic militants, who draw their inspiration and directives from Iran and its growing cadre of satellite states. The spread of fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, coupled with the possibility that Iran will acquire nuclear weapons, poses a more frightening threat from an adversary less rational and therefore less controllable than was Soviet Communism. How democracies can defend themselves against this new threat concludes this provocative book.",

She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that any job equals a better life. But how can anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6 to $7 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich moved from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, taking the cheapest lodgings available and accepting work as a waitress, hotel maid, house cleaner, nursing-home aide, and Wal-Mart salesperson. She soon discovered that even the \"lowliest\" occupations require exhausting mental and physical efforts. And one job is not enough; you need at least two if you intend to live indoors.Nickel and Dimed reveals low-wage America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity -- a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate strategies for survival. Instantly acclaimed for its insight, humor, and passion, this book is changing the way America perceives its working poor.",
