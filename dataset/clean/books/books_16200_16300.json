When assistant district attorney and sex crimes prosecutor Alexandra Cooper hears about the case, it strikes her as a classic scene from Poe's fiction...except that forensic evidence shows this young woman died within the last twenty-five years.Meanwhile, Alex is furious at the news that an old nemesis may be preying on women once again on Manhattan's exclusive Upper East Side. The Silk Stocking Rapist first struck four years ago, leaving a string of victims in his wake, then abruptly disappeared before Alex and the NYPD could identify him. Now, with improved forensic technology and a national DNA data bank to draw from, a fresh attack may give Alex a new lease on many old crimes, just in time to beat the statute of limitations.But when a woman dies as a result of her injuries, Alex's search for justice for the rapist's prior victims becomes a hunt for a killer as well. As Alex peels back the layers of the murdered woman's past indiscretions, she finds more than one potential enemy and many intriguing connections between the Silk Stocking Rapist, his victims, and the haunting theme of revenge that pervades Poe's stories.The case takes Alex and detectives Mercer Wallace and Mike Chapman from a quiet college campus to the stunning, 250-acre forest that comprises the New York Botanical Gardens. There, an enigmatic librarian presides over the Raven Society, a secretive group devoted to the work of Poe. Could it be that their fascination with a writer famed for depicting bizarre and exquisitely planned murders goes well beyond scholarly interest? In exploring the fabled writer's tormented life for clues, Alex will cross paths with a cunning killer and face some of the greatest challenges of her career.",

In Dr. Arno Penzias's view, the explosive growth of technology in the past decade has transformed our lives nearly beyond recognition and brought us to the brink of a new era.Today, networked computers allow information to flow directly from source to user - bypassing a host of formerly busy human intermediaries in the process. Because much of present-day office work is more easily accomplished by electronics than people, the focus of work has shifted from colleagues to customers - thereby boosting externally focused tasks such as sales and consulting. The new technology supports a growing trend toward nomadic information workers, who are able to carry their office wherever the task of the moment takes them.What tasks lie ahead for our evolving workforce? While today's products and services are markedly better than past offerings, shortcomings abound: These new gizmos are often hard to use, incompatible with each other, and a burden on our natural environment.The solution to these problems lies in the huge task of harmonizing the outputs of our technology. We are entering the era of harmony, a system of marketplace value that will emphasize ease of use, true systems integration, and environmental renewal. This new competitive challenge will occupy the workers who seemed to be the first casualty of the information age.",

        "Description": "What Do Citicorp, UPS and Marriott have in common? They are \"breakthrough\" service providers, firms that changed the rules of the game in their respective industries by consistently meeting or exceeding customer needs and expectations. To find out how these companies do it, service management experts James Heskett, Earl Sasser, and Christopher Hart put the question to the chief executive officers of fifteen of America's leading service firms attending a workshop at the Harvard Business School. Breakthrough leaders, they discovered, think very differently about their businesses than do their competitors, in distinct and well-defined ways. Now, in Service Breakthroughs, based upon five years of exhaustive research in fourteen service industries, Heskett, Sasser, and Hart show exactly what enables one or two companies in each industry to constantly set new standards for quality and value that force competitors to adapt or fail. At the heart of breakthrough performance, the authors contend, is a sometimes intuitive but thorough understanding of the \"self-reinforcing service cycle\" that replaces traditional management of \"trade-offs.\" The \"cycle\" is a paradigm derived from the research results suggesting direct links between heightened customer satisfaction, increased customer retention, augmented sales and profit, improved quality and productivity, greater service value per unit of cost, improved satisfaction of service providers, increased employee retention, and further heightened customer satisfaction. With detailed examples and dramatic case studies of Mark Twain Bancshares, American Airlines, Florida Power & Light, Federal Express, McDonald's and many other companies, Heskett, Sasser, and Hart show how this self-reinforcing cycle of behavior differentiates breakthrough leaders from their \"merely good\" competitors. The authors describe how breakthrough managers develop counterintuitive, even contrarian, strategic service visions. These companies define their \"service concept\" in terms of results achieved for customers rather than services performed. They target market segments by focusing on psychographics -- how customers think and behave -- instead of demographics. And instead of viewing a service delivery system as a facility where the service is producted and sold, breakthrough firms see it as an opportunity to enhance the quality of the service.  These profound differences in thought and action have brought spectacular results. For managers who wish to set the pace in their service industries, Service Breakthroughs will be essential reading.",

Theo Wuttke, a former East German functionary, is a keen observer and a gifted speaker. Ludwig Hoftaller is a mid-level spy whose loyalties shift with each new regime. Together, both men see what the future is bringing as they try to save what they can from the past and understand the meaning of being German.A complex and challenging exploration of what Germany's reunification will mean-for Germans, for Europe, and for the world-Too Far Afield is a masterwork from one of Europe's greatest writers.

In an age when self-help methods abound and meditation is increasingly popular, Wills reminds us that the rosary is a ?timely and timeless? method for reconnecting with ourselves and with our faith. As he discusses each mystery, Wills guides us through the lives of Jesus and Mary, reflecting on Scripture passages and their teachings with his signature elegant, lucid prose.  With gorgeous full-color reproductions of paintings by Renaissance master Tintoretto illustrating the mysteries, The Rosary will be the perfect book for those who practice the rosary themselves or for those who are seeking a new and timeless form of contemplation.",

        "Authors": "By Woodman, Richard",
        "Description": "Perhaps even more than the waves and weather, sea officers of the past feared the ever-present risk of mutiny. Functioning as a microcosm of dissent in our society at large, the steep hierarchy and deep social divisions between the crew and their commanders, the misery and monotony of very hard work and little sleep, and the constant threat of death from shipwreck, disease, or the enemy often led to an anarchic breakdown of any semblance of stability or order at sea.The notorious mutiny on the Bounty in 1787 has been elevated to iconic status by Hollywood, yet Richard Woodman describes it here as a mere \u201cpup\u201d among mutinies. Despite the usual portrayal, Captain Bligh was neither tyrant nor sadist\u2014whereas Pigot of the Hermione was both, and his crew was probably justified in throwing him overboard. Woodman brings a seaman\u2019s perspective to this compelling history, which stretches from Magellan\u2019s successful handling of an uprising that took place on his great voyage of discovery in 1519, to the \u201csordid crimes\u201d that mutinies had become by the end of the Second World War.",

        "Description": "For nearly two decades, since the publication of her iconic first novel, The Good Mother, Sue Miller has distinguished herself as one of our most elegant and widely celebrated chroniclers of family life, with a singular gift for laying bare the interior lives of her characters. In each of her novels, Miller has written with exquisite precision about the experience of grace in daily life\u2013the sudden, epiphanic recognition of the extraordinary amid the ordinary\u2013as well as the sharp and unexpected motions of the human heart away from it, toward an unruly netherworld of upheaval and desire. But never before have Miller\u2019s powers been keener or more transfixing than they are in Lost in the Forest, a novel set in the vineyards of Northern California that tells the story of a young girl who, in the wake of a tragic accident, seeks solace in a damaging love affair with a much older man.Eva, a divorced and happily remarried mother of three, runs a small bookstore in a town north of San Francisco. When her second husband, John, is killed in a car accident, her family\u2019s fragile peace is once again overtaken by loss. Emily, the eldest, must grapple with newfound independence and responsibility. Theo, the youngest, can only begin to fathom his father\u2019s death. But for Daisy, the middle child, John\u2019s absence opens up a world of bewilderment, exposing her at the onset of adolescence to the chaos and instability that hover just beyond the safety of parental love. In her sorrow, Daisy embarks on a harrowing sexual odyssey, a journey that will cast her even farther out onto the harsh promontory of adulthood and lost hope.With astonishing sensuality and immediacy, Lost in the Forest moves through the most intimate realms of domestic life, from grief and sex to adolescence and marriage. It is a stunning, kaleidoscopic evocation of a family in crisis, written with delicacy and masterful care. For her lifelong fans and those just discovering Sue Miller for the first time, here is a rich and gorgeously layered tale of a family breaking apart and coming back together again: Sue Miller at her inimitable best.",

        "Description": "Over the years, Rabbi Bernice Kimel Weiss has shepherded hundreds of non-Jewish students into the family of the Jewish people. For most, the interest in Judaism is sparked by a decision to marry a Jewish man or woman. But that is only the beginning. In the gentle hands of a teacher who has witnessed and understands their turmoil, their conflicts, their tears, they bare their personal struggles. What emerge are amazing,  powerful, soul-stirring stories of re-creation - the extraordinary adventure of becoming a Jew at the turn of the 21st century. An Asian-American whose father owns a Japanese restaurant marries a secular Jew but leads him to Orthodox Judaism; a Belgian raised by nuns meets a Jew and finds her faith in Israel; a former Sunday school teacher from a small farm town falls in love with a Jewish girl and with her faith as well; an African-American woman lawyer, a Harvard graduate, discovers Judaism and keeps kosher in a small southern town: their varied stories and eight more are revealed in these pages. The twists and turns and the direction their lives ultimately take are a source of inspiration to those contemplating Judaism, and to all in search of faith. They are a gift to the Jewish people.",

        "Authors": "By Longman, Jere",
        "Description": "The last time a Philadelphia professional sports team won a championship, Ronald Reagan was in the White House and Return of the Jediwas number one at the box office. No city with all four major sports -- football, basketball, baseball and hockey -- has gone longer without a championship. The local NFL franchise, the Eagles, has not won a titlesince 1960, putting its devoted fans through decades of futility and heartbreak.But finally, in 2004, following three consecutive wrenching losses in the NFC championship game, the beleaguered Eagles finally had a shot. After superstar wide receiver Terrell Owens injured his ankle, the fans reacted with a peculiar blend of hope and dread, but stuck by the team. And when Owens returned for the Super Bowl, the city sat poised, at long last, on the verge of sporting salvation.In the tradition of Fever Pitch and Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer, and peppered with riotous anecdotes about the superfans, grandstand brawlers and football lunatics who make Philadelphia one of the most entertaining places in America to watch a game, If Football's a Religion, Why Don't We Have a Prayer? is the hilarious day-by-day account of the operatic passion of Eagle fans, as it threatens to spin out of control in the dizzying buildup to the team's first appearance in the Super Bowl since 1981. From the city's annual Wing Bowl, a near-mythological gastronomic fete in which contestants attempt to devour their weight in chicken wings, to oversize and outlandish Eagle lawn decorations, to hygiene-defying contests for playoff tickets, Eagle enthusiasm is raised to a bizarre new level. Even Pennsylvania's governor, Ed Rendell, a season-ticket holder, gets in on the act, splitting his duties between the state house and a local sports cable channel, where he spends two hours analyzing each Eagles game.With unprecedented detail and firsthand reporting, New York Times sportswriter and longtime resident of Philadelphia Jere Longman reveals what happens when the losingest sports town in America finally has a shot at winning it all.",

        "Description": "Two fourteen-year-old girls, fed up with the \"Hooters\" shirts worn by their male classmates, design their own rooster logo: \"Cocks: Nothing to crow about.\" Seventeen-year-old April Schuldt, unmarried, pregnant, and cheated out of her election as homecoming queen by squeamish school administrators, disrupts a pep rally with a protest that engages the whole school.Where are spirited girls like these in the popular accounts of teenage girlhood, that supposed wasteland of depression, low self-esteem, and passive victimhood? This book, filled with the voices of teenage girls, corrects the misperceptions that have crept into our picture of female adolescence. Based on the author's yearlong conversation with white junior-high and middle-school girls--from the working poor and the middle class--Raising Their Voices allows us to hear how girls adopt some expectations about gender but strenuously resist others, how they use traditionally feminine means to maintain their independence, and how they recognize and resist pressures to ignore their own needs and wishes.With a psychologist's sensitivity and an anthropologist's attention to cultural variations, Lyn Brown makes provocative observations about individual differences in the girls' experiences and attitudes, and shows how their voices are shaped and constrained by class--with working-class girls more willing to be openly angry than their middle-class peers, and yet more likely to denigrate themselves and attribute their failures to personal weakness.A compelling and timely corrective to conventional wisdom, this book attunes our hearing to the true voices of teenage girls: determined, confused, amusing, touching, feisty, and clear.",

It's no wonder John writes articles like \"Interview with the Stepfather\" and \"Memoirs from Hell.\" The only release he finds is in homemade zines like the amazing Escape Velocity by Marisol, a self-proclaimed \"Puerto Rican Cuban Yankee Lesbian.\" Haning around the Boston Tower Records for the new issue of Escape Velocity, John meets Marisol and a hard love is born.  While at first their friendship is based on zines, dysfuntional families, and dreams of escape, soon both John and Marisol begin to shed their protective shells. Unfortunately, John mistakes this growing intimacy for love, and a disastrous date to his junior prom leaves that friendship in ruins. Desperately hoping to fix things, John convinces Marisol to come with him to a zine conference on Cape Cod. On the sandy beaches by the Bluefish Wharf Inn, John realizes just how hard love can be.  With keen insight into teenage life, Ellen Wittlinger delivers a story of adolescence that is fierce and funny -- and ultimately transforming -- even as it explores the pain of growing up.",

        "Description": "Quest for the Presidency 1992 reveals for the first time the full story of what really happened in the tumultuous 1992 presidential election.  With unparalleled access to the inner workings of the various campaigns, Newsweek's award-winning team of reporters gathered the in-depth stories of the candidates; their handlers, pollsters, and supporters; and their strategies, strengths, and weaknesses. Woven together here in spellbinding and insightful narrative, these accounts reveal the changing order of American politics, which saw the strongest third-force challenge in eighty years, and the changing portrait of the American voter, more cynical yet more involved in shaping the political process than ever before.  The rich reporting and you-are-there intimacy of private meetings, confidential conversations, informal war-gaming sessions, and other key moments in the campaigns provide new insight into the players and events of this critical election year.  A broad array of never-before-published campaign documents and sixty-one of Newsweek's best on-the-scene photographs flesh out the record. The result offers an essential guide to understanding not only the Clinton candidacy but also the Clinton presidency; keen human understanding of George Bush's fall; and a hint of how a Texas billionaire's down-home style may have changed the political terrain forever.",

A lady shouldn't do something she's going to feel guilty about later, was a rule Belle kept firmly in mind.So begins The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell, a story of murder, adultery, and regular church attendance, which introduces Belle Cantrell as a beautiful young widow with a rebellious streak, years before she will become grandmother to Sissy LeBlanc, the feisty main character of Loraine Despres's bestselling The Scandalous Summer of Sissy LeBlanc.The year is 1920, prohibition is in full swing, women are clamoring for the vote, and a narrow-minded intolerance is on the rise. Life isn't easy for an unmarried woman, not in a little town like Gentry, Louisiana, especially after she's sent to jail for swimming in an indecent bathing costume with a group of suffragists.It's not as if Belle doesn't know how to behave. She knows the rules. She keeps the Primer of Propriety firmly in mind. But sometimes -- most of the time -- she has to twist the rules a little, or break them, or give them a permanent kink, because they all say the same thing: \"Don't.\"And a girl has got to live.After a year and a half of mourning, Belle decides to get on with her life and kicks off a season of tumult that will change her and Gentry forever.Sexy, sassy, with laugh-out-loud humor and a cast of zany characters you won't forget, The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell is a big comic love story and a page-turner. But it delves deeper, as Belle struggles to find her moral center and stand up to forces that are determined to destroy the soul of a town and the people she loves.",

With ample humor and insight, Epstein uncovers the new outlets upon which the old snobbery has fastened: food and wine, fashion, high-achieving children, schools, politics, health, being with-it, name-dropping, and much else, including the roles of Jews and homosexuals in the development of snobbery. He also raises the question of whether snobbery might, alas, be a part of human nature. Snobbery: The American Versionis the first book in English devoted exclusively to the subject since Thackeray's THE BOOK OF SNOBS.",

It is the latter we must change for that is what is aging and killing us.

First, young Garric rescues the castaway Tenoctris; then, amazingly, a huge galley lands, bearing a court envoy searching for the lost heir to a dukedom - and finding her in Sharina, Garric's sister. Immediately after the galley departs with Sharina to seek out her destiny, another party arrives by coach, led by a merchant sorcerer eager to hire Garric - who sets out with this party, accompanied by Tenoctris and by the shepherd Cashel and his sister, Ilna, both of whom are discovered to have some magical power.Garric and Sharina, Cashel and Ilna, all travel toward romance, danger, and astonishing magic that will transform them and their world.",

        "Title": "Science for All Americans",
        "Authors": "By Rutherford, F. James and Ahlgren, Andrew",
        "Description": "In order to compete in the modern world, any society today must rank education in science, mathematics, and technology as one of its highest priorities. It's a sad but true fact, however, that most Americans are not scientifically literate. International studies of educational performance reveal that U.S. students consistently rank near the bottom in science and mathematics. The latest study of the National Assessment of Educational Progress has found that despite some small gains recently, the average performance of seventeen-year-olds in 1986 remained substantially lower than it had been in 1969.  As the world approaches the twenty-first century, American schools-- when it comes to the advancement of scientific knowledge-- seem to be stuck in the Victorian age.In Science for All Americans, F. James Rutherford and Andrew Ahlgren brilliantly tackle this devastating problem.  Based on Project 2061, a scientific literacy initiative sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, this wide-ranging, important volume explores what constitutes scientific literacy in a modern society; the knowledge, skills, and attitudes all students should acquire from their total school experience from kindergarten through high school; and what steps this country must take to begin reforming its system of education in science, mathematics, and technology.Science for All Americans describes the scientifically literate person as one who knows that science, mathematics, and technology are interdependent enterprises with strengths and limitations; who understands key concepts and principles of science; who recognizes both the diversity and unity of the natural world; and who uses scientific knowledge and scientific ways of thinking for personal and social purposes. Its recommendations for educational reform downplay  traditional subject categories and instead highlight the connections between them. It also emphasizes ideas and thinking skills over the memorization of specialized vocabulary. For instance, basic scientific literacy means knowing that the chief function of living cells is assembling protein molecules according to the instructions coded in DNA molecules, but does not mean necessarily knowing the terms \"ribosome\" or \"deoxyribonucleic acid.\"Science, mathematics, and technology will be at the center of the radical changes in the nature of human existence that will occur during the next life span; therefore, preparing today's children for tomorrow's world must entail a solid education in these areas. Science for All Americans will help pave the way for the necessary reforms in America's schools.",

It's the year 2001 when Danny, a divorced journalist, returns to his old neighborhood for his father's funeral. He's spent all of his adult life trying to leave Brooklyn behind him -- along with all the drugs, music, and other psychedelic memories from the sixties spent on Hippie Hill. But now that the box of rain has been opened there's no turning back, and Danny must face some painful truths about the woman he used to love -- and her father, a police officer, whom he may or may not have killed.  By turns a thriller, a detective story, and a coming-of-age tale, Long Time Gone is a bittersweet love letter to a lost New York that no reader will soon forget.",

When they live in an era characterized by on unprecedented rate of change? When the very things they refuse to give up, the sacred cows of the business world, are the lodestones that will kill their careers and block their companies' path to success? In this insightful and unique guide, Kriegel and Brandt reveal why people hold on to the old and how to inspire them to bring on the new - to the point where they're enthusiastically turning even their favorite sacred cows into burgers.Tackling one of the most important business issues of today, the authors demonstrate why the latest panaceas - reengineering, virtual teams, outsourcing, reinventing, restructuring, downsizing - almost always prove unsuccessful. They expose how these buzzword programs overlook the most fundamental element of all business: people. After all, people are the gatekeepers of change, with the power to breathe life into a new program or kill it. If they're excited and positive, it's open sesame; if they're resistant, they'll slam the door in your face. Getting to the heart of the matter, Kriegel and Brandt show you how to coach yourself and others to create Change-Ready people.",

        "Title": "The Harvard Book: Selections from Three Centuries, Revised Edition",
        "Authors": "By Bentinck-Smith, William",
        "Description": "If Harvard can be said to have a literature all its own, then few universities can equal it in scope. Here lies the reason for this anthology--a collection of what Harvard men (teachers, students, graduates) have written about Harvard in the more than three centuries of its history. The emphasis is upon entertainment, upon readability; and the selections have been arranged to show something of the many variations of Harvard life.For all Harvard men--and that part of the general public which is interested in American college life--here is a rich treasury. In such a Harvard collection one may expect to find the giants of Harvard's last 75 years, Eliot, Lowell, and Conant, attempting a definition of what Harvard means. But there are many other familiar names - Henry Dunster, Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Russell Lowell, Henry Adams, Charles M. Flandrau, William and Henry James, Owen Wister, Thomas Wolfe, John P. Marquaud. Here is Mistress Eaton's confession about the bad fish served to the wretched students of Harvard's early years; here too is President Holyoke's account of the burning of Harvard Hall; a student's description of his trip to Portsmouth with that aged and Johnsonian character, Tutor Henry Flynt; Cleveland Amory's retelling of the murder of Dr. George Parkman; Mayor Quiney's story of what happened in Cambridge when Andrew Jackson came to get an honorary degree; Alistair Cooke's commentary on the great Harvard-Yale cricket match of 1951. There are many sorts of Harvard men in this book--popular fellows like Hammersmith, snobs like Bertie and Billy, the sensitive and the lonely like Edwin Arlington Robinson and Thomas Wolfe, and independent thinkers like John Reed. Teachers and pupils, scholars and sports, heroes and rogues pass across the Harvard stage through the struggles and the tragedies to the moments of triumph like the Bicentennial or the visit of Winston Churchill.And speaking of visits, there are the visitors too--the first impressions of Harvard set down by an assortment of travelers as various as Dickens, Trollope, Rupert Brooke, Harriet Martineau, and Francisco de Miranda, the \"precursor of Latin American independence.\"For the Harvard addict this volume is indispensable. For the general reader it is the sort of book that goes with a good living-room fire or the blissful moments of early to bed.",
