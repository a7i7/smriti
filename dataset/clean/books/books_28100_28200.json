        "Title": "The Kennedys: The Third Generation",
        "Authors": "By Gibson, Barbara, Schwartz, Ted, and Schwarz, Ted",
        "Description": "Here is the complete story of the youngest generation of the indefatigable Kennedy clan - the 29 grandchildren of Joseph and Rose Kennedy - as told by Barbara Gibson, Rose's personal secretary. Having lived for many years side by side with the three generations of Kennedys, she is in a unique position to understand the goings on behind the scenes and walls of the Kennedy compounds in Hyannisport and Palm Beach. During her time with the Kennedy matriarch, Gibson experienced first hand many of the anecdotes she shares and she became friends with Kennedy cousins, aides, assistants, and security personnel, who revealed their Kennedy stories to her for the first time.The Kennedys as a family have had an extraordinary impact on the politics, culture, and tabloids of the United States. The Kennedys is an examination of this most famous American dynasty from a generational perspective. Gibson examines the rise, fall, and rise of the Kennedys, fueled by the intense power drive of the clan and desire to win at any cost instilled by Joe Sr. and Rose. This ruthless competitive streak brought the second generation to great heights with the Presidency of JFK but also great tragedy - the premature deaths of Kathleen and Joe Jr., the unwarranted lobotomy of Rosemary, and, of course, Chappaquiddick.In the third generation we see this characteristic self-destructiveness and arrogant disregard for others passed on from their parents. Saddled with womanizing fathers and negligent mothers, the Kennedy grandchildren inherited a variety of personality problems and reckless behavior patterns that they are still struggling to overcome.With few exceptions, all the Kennedy grandchildren have experimented with drugs, and several have become severe addicts, one cousin dying from an overdose. Gibson examines problems with physical and emotonal abuse, culminating in such public scandals as the William Kennedy Smith rape trial. These she relates back to the experiences of the second generation in terms of how the family bands together in times of crisis to protect their own, shielding an individual from legal responsibility but not addressing the deep-rooted cause of the problem.The Kennedys is ultimately a story of redemption as Gibson examines the accomplishments of many of the third generation, the political successes and good works, especially in the areas of the environment and education. She proves that in many ways the Kennedys are rising again, although not necessarily in the way Joe Sr. might have envisioned, as the Kennedy grandchildren live their lives in fulfillment of many of the goals to which their forebears merely paid lip service.",

        "Title": "The Souvenir: A Daughter Discovers Her Father's War",
        "Authors": "By Steinman, Louise",
        "Description": "Louise Steinman's father never talked about his experiences in the Pacific during WWII-like many men of his generation. All she knew was that a whistling kettle unnerved him, that Asian food was banned from the house, and that she was never to cry in front of him.  After her parents' deaths, Steinman discovered a box containing some four hundred letters her father had written to her mother during the war. Among the letters, she found a Japanese flag inscribed with elegant calligraphy. The flag said: \"To Yoshio Shimizu given to him in the Great East Asian War to be fought to the end. If you believe in it, you win.\" Intrigued by her father's letters and compelled to know how this flag came to be in his possession, Steinman sets out on a quest to learn what happened to her father and the men of his Twenty-fifth Infantry Division.  Over the course of her exploration, Steinman decides to return the flag to the family of Yoshio Shimizu, the fallen Japanese soldier. She travels to the snow country of Japan and visits the battlefield in the Philippines where her father's division fought-the place where Yoshio lost his life and his flag. In the end, Steinman discovers a side of her father she never knew, and, astonishingly, she develops a kinship with the surviving family of his enemy.  Weaving together her father's letters with the story of her own personal journey, Steinman presents a powerful view of how war changed one generation and shaped another.",

        "Description": "From the celebrated author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People, a profound and practical book about doing well by doing good.For decades now, from the pulpit and through his writing, Harold Kushner has been helping people navigate the rough patches of life: loss, guilt, crises of faith. Now, in this compelling new work, he ad-dresses an equally important issue: our craving for significance, the need to know that our lives and our choices mean something.We sometimes do great things, and sometimes terrible things, to reassure ourselves that we matter to the world. We sometimes confuse fame, power, and wealth with true achievement. But finally we need to think of ourselves as good people, and we are troubled when we compromise our integrity in the pursuit of what we think of as success.Harold Kushner tells us that the path to a truly successful and significant life is through friendship, through family, and through acts of generosity and self-sacrifice. He describes how, in affecting the life of even one person in a positive way, we make a difference in the world, and prove that we do in fact matter.Persuasive and sympathetic, anecdotal and commonsensical, Living a Life That Matters inspires and uplifts.",

        "Title": "The Senator's Wife",
        "Authors": "By Robards, Karen",
        "Description": "Ronnie Honneker is the senator's wife - his second wife. The Honorable Lewis Honneker, a man twice her age, is wealthy, successful, and revered by voters in his home state of Mississippi. What the public doesn't know is that this pillar of the community is fond of engaging in casual indiscretions. Now he's running for re-election and his young wife is expected to stand by him. Though scorned as the woman who broke up the senator's first marriage, Ronnie does her best to promote her husband's re-election campaign. But she never would have guessed that marriage to a wealthy man could be so lonely. The glamour of political life can't make up for the emptiness deep in her heart, a dark space she fears will never be full.Until political strategist Tom Quinlan enters the picture.Solid, quietly handsome, the southern boy-next-door, Quinlan prides himself on his work, never mixing business with pleasure. Called in to enhance the senator's campaign, he finds his biggest challenge in Ronnie as he struggles to make her appear less glamorous and more likable to the voting public. To him, Ronnie is a job. A routine assignment. So why does he find himself unable to stop thinking about her? Her fiery hair, her long, perfectly muscled legs, those inviting chocolate-brown eyes? Tom has never allowed himself to surrender to such feelings...until now.Ronnie never expected to find love again, and certainly not with a man like Tom Quinlan. But she can't fight the pull that Tom has on her as he awakens feelings in her body that she'd thought were gone forever. And she knows the tempers that flare between them are only a cover for their barely contained passions. Together they discover that love and politics are uneasy bedfellows as they contend with their burgeoning attraction to each other, a swarm of snooping reporters, and a public growing increasingly suspicious of their relationship.When the senator mysteriously dies in the midst of a sticky scandal, Ronnie and Tom must answer to the growing rumors of their love, and clear themselves of any guilt in his death. Realizing it would be easier to keep up appearances, they take the ultimate political gamble and risk everything for each other. But as the stakes rise, they learn that they must watch their backs.And follow their hearts.",

Inspired by the colorful mosaic of ancient Greek myths, he has created six equally rich contemporary fables \u2014 six lives governed by false gods.Hermes, or in Auchincloss's ironic interpretation, \"god of the self-made man,\" is a Jewish lawyer who finds acceptance into WASP society only at greatest personal cost; Hephaestus is a bachelor designer of Palladian villas whose young bride, enamored of newfangled things, compels him to \"go modern.\" In other stories, a former World War II naval officer, guided perhaps by the goddess Athene, escapes a sinking cruise ship by disguising himself as a woman; and a Catholic convert, distracted by the muse Polyhymnia, is torn between his priestly duties and his worldly social and artistic ambitions.In every tale a unique moral sensibility holds sway, revealing how the pagan impulse may surface in the most unlikely and provocative situations, compromising even the noblest of spirits. Keenly insightful, flawlessly executed, False Gods is the work of a master storyteller, widely acclaimed as American society's most entertaining and intelligent critic.",

Here, in The Green Tea Book, is a clear guide to understanding why green tea works, and how you can use it for both good health and great taste.The Green Tea Book begins by exploring the scientific research that supports this beverage's properties. It then focuses on green tea's long and rich history, from its centuries-old place of honor in Asian cultures to its growing use in the West. The book goes on to examine the individual benefits green tea offers - its use as an antioxidant in the prevention of cancer, heart disease, and stroke; its ability to promote longevity; its use as a digestive aid; its many benefits to women's health; and its role in fighting cavities and gingivitis. It even provides a practical section on choosing, brewing, and storing teas year-round.",

The contributors, with names like Tobias Wolff, Andre Dubus, Doc Watson, J. Carter Brown, Thomas Moore, Steve Reich, and Paulo Coehlo, are a veritable who's who of notable people. Despite their widely varying backgrounds and professions, these luminaries have a common thread running through their lives: They have all been motivated, encouraged, consoled, and healed by the spirit of God.Readers will sense inspiration's undeniable presence as Leontyne Price describes feeling as though she is \"in the hands of God\" when she is singing; they will sense its power to heal as author Andre Dubus relates how, following a tragic car accident that left him in a wheelchair, he moved from despair to thankfulness; and they will come to understand it as never before when Dr. Lori Wiener tells how working with children with AIDS was uplifting and hopeful because of the courage her young patients showed.A fascinating look at an elusive phenomenon as well as an intimate glimpse into the lives of some of the eminent figures of the twentieth century, Inspired is a book that more than lives up to its name.",

        "Description": "They are ordinary people from all walks of life, all ages and different religions. Yet they share an extraordinary secret that most have been reluctant to reveal except to their closest friends and relatives: they have seen, touched, heard, or even spoken to Jesus at a pivotal moment in their lives - and come away transformed. Dr. Gregory Scott Sparrow is a psychotherapist who has been collecting stories of Christ encounters for more than five years and has traveled across America talking about his own encounters with Jesus. He has written a deeply inspiring and profoundly moving book that offers not only his own experiences of a loving, healing, personal Jesus but the vivid true-life accounts of other men, women, and children whose lives have been touched by a Jesus who is closer than we usually realize.From descriptions of dramatic near-death encounters to miraculous healings of mind and body, and from unexpected meetings on busy side streets to sacred encounters in quiet rooms, people reveal the remarkable Christ encounters that until now they have kept as personal treasures. Their reports are joyous or serene, uplifting or unsettling. But they are invariably life-changing - lifting burdens and offering hope and the power to change or bestowing a new understanding of the nature of life and faith.As Dr. Sparrow writes in his introduction to the book, \"Jesus Christ occupies a uniquely important place in our spiritual, cultural, and psychological lives, regardless of what we profess to believe. As many of the recipients of these experiences have discovered, one does not have to believe any particular thing about Christ in order to find him deeply involved in our most life-changing experiences.\"",

        "Title": "After Tet: The Bloodiest Year in Vietnam",
        "Authors": "By Spector, Ronald H.",
        "Description": "In the wake of the Tet Offensive in January and February 1968, Lyndon Johnson announced the cessation of bombing against North Vietnam and America's determination to seek peace. As negotiations began in Paris, most Americans believed the war was winding down and, indeed, almost over. Yet, ironically, the year that followed the Tet Offensive saw the fiercest battles of the Vietnam War. Now, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of that bloodiest year, Ronald Spector has written a brilliant narrative account of the harrowing events that rarely reached American television screens but largely determined the war's course and outcome.The terrible battles of 1968 condemned America and North and South Vietnam to five more years of war precisely because they were costly and inconclusive. These bloody but indecisive operations could not break, but could only perpetuate, the war's diplomatic and military deadlock. For the rank-and-file soldier, the war raged on. Drawing upon recently declassified government documents, accounts by GIs, and his own eye-witness experience as a Marine in Vietnam that year, noted military historian Ronald Spector describes the vicious struggle in the jungles, mountains, and rice paddies. He shows how the bloodiest year epitomized every aspect of the war - from individual bravery to military doggedness to political vacillation - as both sides mounted increasingly expensive and desperate offensives. He reveals the experience of the soldiers caught between an ambivalent American government and an intransigent North Vietnamese leadership.Exploring the lesser known aspects of the war, Spector describes in detail the deterioration of American military race relations, the growth of the drug culture, the riots in U.S. military prisons, and even the experience of South Vietnamese soldiers and Viet Cong. Describing the bloodiest year from all angles - the personal, military, and political, the American and the Vietnamese -this comprehensive history will stand as one of the most important books ever written about the American military experience in Vietnam.",

        "Title": "The Fifth Miracle: The Search for the Origin and Meaning of Life",
        "Authors": "By Davies, P. C. W.",
        "Description": "How and where did life begin? Is it a chemical fluke, unique to Earth, or the product of intriguingly bio-friendly laws governing the entire universe? In his latest far-reaching book, The Fifth Miracle, internationally acclaimed physicist and writer Paul Davies confronts one of science's great outstanding mysteries -- the origin of life.  Davies shows how new research hints that the crucible of life lay deep within Earth's hot crust, and not in a \"warm little pond,\" as first suggested by Charles Darwin. Bizarre microbes discovered dwelling in the underworld and around submarine volcanic vents are thought to be living fossils. This discovery has transformed scientists' expectations for life on Mars and elsewhere in the universe. Davies stresses the key role that the bombardment of the planets by giant comets and asteroids has played in the origin and evolution of life, arguing that these \"deep impacts\" delivered the raw material for biology, but also kept life confined to its subterranean haven for millions of years.  Recently, scientists have uncovered tantalizing clues that life may have existed and may still exist -- elsewhere in the universe. The Fifth Miracle recounts the discovery in Antarctica of a meteorite from Mars (ALH84001) that may contain traces of life. Three and a half billion years ago, Mars resembled Earth. It was warm and wet and could have supported primitive organisms. Davies believes that the red planet may still harbor microbes in thermally heated rocks deep below the Martian permafrost. He goes on to describe a still more startling scenario: If life once existed on Mars, might it have originated there and traveled to Earth inside meteorites blasted into space by cosmic impacts? Conversely, did life spread from Earth to Mars? Could microbes have journeyed even farther afield inside comets?  Davies builds on the latest scientific discoveries and theories to address the larger question: What, exactly, is life? Davies shows that the living call is an information-processing system that uses a sophisticated mathematical code, and he argues that the secret of life lies not with exotic chemistry but with the emergence of information-based complexity. He then goes on to ask: Is life the inevitable by-product of physical laws, as many scientists maintain, or an almost miraculous accident? Are we alone in the universe, or will life emerge on all Earthlike planets? And if there is life elsewhere in the universe, is it preordained to evolve toward greater complexity and intelligence? On the answers to these deep questions hinges the ultimate purpose of mankind -- who we are and what our place might be in the unfolding drama of the cosmos.",
