        "Description": "Pilar is a capable, energetic merchant in the small, Peruvian highland settlement of Chiuchin. Genovena, an unmarried day laborer in the same town, faces an impoverished old age without children to support her. Carmen is the wife of a prosperous farmer in the agricultural community of Mayobamba, eleven thousand feet above Chiuchin in the Andean sierra. Mariana, a madre soltera\u2014single mother\u2014without a husband or communal land of her own, also resides in Mayobamba.These lives form part of an interlocking network that the authors carefully examine in Women of the Andes. In doing so, they explore the riddle of women\u2019s structural subordination by analyzing the social, political, and economic realities of life in Peru. They examine theoretical explanations of sexual hierarchies against the backdrop of life histories. The result is a study that pinpoints the mechanisms perpetuating sexual repression and traces the impact of social change and national policy on women\u2019s lives.",

        "Authors": "By Delaney, Frank",
        "Description": "From a land famous for storytelling comes an \"absolute masterpiece\"* -- an epic novel of Ireland that captures the intimate, passionate texture of the Irish spirit.One wintry evening in 1951, an itinerant storyteller -- a Seanchai, the very last practitioner of a fabled tradition extending back hundreds of years -- arrives unannounced at a house in the Irish countryside. In exchange for a bed and a warm meal, he invites his hosts and some of their neighbors to join him by the fireside, and begins to tell formative stories of Ireland's history. One of his listeners, a nine-year-old boy, grows so entranced by the story-telling that, when the old man leaves abruptly under mysterious circumstances, the boy devotes himself to finding him again.Ronan's search for the Storyteller becomes both a journey of self-discovery and an immersion into the sometimes-conflicting histories of his native land. As the long-unspoken secrets of his own family begin to reveal themselves, he becomes increasingly single-minded in pursuit of the old man, who he fears may already be dead. But Ronan's personal path also leads him deeper and deeper into the history and mythology of Ireland itself, in all its drama, intrigue, and heroism.Ireland travels through the centuries, interweaving Ronan's quest for the Storyteller with a richly evocative unfolding of the great moments in Irish history, ranging from the savage grip of the Ice Age to the green andtroubled land of tourist brochures and political unrest. Along the way, we meet foolish kings and innocent monks, fabled saints and great works of art, shrewd Normanraiders, strong tribal leaders, poets, politicians, and lovers. Each illuminates the magic of Ireland and the eternal connection of its people to the land.A sweeping novel of huge ambition, Ireland is the beautifully told story of a remarkable nation. From the epic sweep of its telling to the precision of its characters -- great and small, tragic and comic -- it rings with the truth of a writer passionate about his country and in full command of his craft.* Jack Higgins",

        "Title": "The Extra Mile: Rethinking Energy Policy for Automotive Transportation (A Twentieth Century Fund Book)",
        "Authors": "By Crandall, Robert W. and Nivola, Pietro S.",
        "Description": "In the United States, proposals for gasoline tax hikes have consistently met with broad-based congressional opposition. Although such taxes are a common and effective method of conserving energy in other industrialized nations, U.S. policy has traditionally relied on regulatory programs rather than fuel taxes to promote energy efficiency in automotive transportation. This book examines both the political causes and the economic effects of this idiosyncratic policy preference.Moderating the consumption and importation of oil has been an explicit goal of the United States over the past twenty years. Pietro S. Nivola and Robert W. Crandall argue that a higher levy on gasoline would be a more efficient way of achieving this goal than current automotive fuel economy standards. In fact, they find that an additional excise of less than twenty-five cents per gallon over the past dozen years would have conserved more oil than has the existing policy of administering gas mileage requirements for new passenger vehicles. And such a tax, they maintain, would not be as detrimental to the economy as opponents fear, nor as regressive as they claim.Why, then, is there such a strong national resistance to a fuel tax in the United States? And why is there less resistance in other countries? The authors examine the development of motor-fuel excises in Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and Canada, and explain the historical and political factors that have led to different national policy orientations.Turning their attention back to the United States, Nivola and Crandall show how regulatory measures have fallen short of their goal and why political barriers to bolder taxation of gasoline remain formidable. They conclude by offering suggestions for new directions in U.S. energy policy at the federal, state, and local level.",

        "Description": "The marital troubles of Prince Charles and Princess Diana that have so engrossed the world are only one more downward step in the decline of the position of the royal family, a decline that began with the abdication of King Edward VII in 1936.There have been, and will be, many other books on the erosion of the House of Windsor, but no one is as qualified to chart its disintegration as Anthony Holden, Britain's leading royal commentator for more than a decade. His bestselling biography of the Prince of Wales, published in 1988 to a mixture of acclaim and controversy, was hailed by The Times of London as \"definitive.\" Recent events have proved it remarkably prophetic. Renowned for the shrewdness of his insights, the accuracy of his reporting, and the reliability of his judgments, Mr. Holden argues that the British monarchy must change in order to survive beyond the reign of the incumbent. Even though the Queen has begun to pay taxes, many hard-pressed Britons still consider the monarchy's wealth disproportionate to the times. Following his separation from his popular wife, Prince Charles's prospects for inheriting the throne have been further compromised by the unseemly revelations of taped telephone conversations. What does the long-term future hold for Diana, Princess of Wales? Should the British monarchy surrender its postimperial splendor for the humbler styles of the \"bicycle kings\" of Scandinavia?In these pages Mr. Holden traces the collapse of the \"family\" monarchy, the true extent of the Queen's wealth, and the changing associations between Crown, Church, and Parliament. The author also analyzes the failure of four royal marriagesbesides Charles and Diana's, those of Princess Margaret, Prince Andrew, and Princess Anne - throwing new light on relations between the royals and those they have wed. He also examines the role played by British institutions, from the press to Downing Street, and looks ahead to the twenty-first century. Will Charles step aside in favor of his son William? Or will Britain become a republic with an elected president?In this important and revealing book, Mr. Holden makes the most authoritative contribution to the worldwide debate on the future of the British monarchy.",

But in East Asia a new system has emerged that challenges the economic principles the West extols. In fact, as James Fallows vividly demonstrates, the theories we embrace to explain how nations rise and fall have prevented us from seeing the true nature of this new system and its enormous impact on us.Skillfully blending history with on-the-ground reportage and astute analysis, Fallows reveals how political goals and historical experience have shaped Japan's economic rise and placed it at the heart of the Asian system. He shows how the explosive growth of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore has been fueled by Japanese investment; why Burma, the Philippines, and Vietnam have been largely isolated from the region's progress; and why Korea, Taiwan, and \"Greater China\" are the strongest contenders for future economic dominance.Extraordinary in depth and scope, Looking At the Sun provides the first clear picture of the Asian rise and the magnitude of its challenge to the Western world.",

        "Description": "Meet the Karasiks, a typical middle-class 1960s family: one mother, one father, one daughter, and three sons, one of whom, David, has autism.  The Ride Together is an extraordinary family memoir told in alternating chapters of comics and text. With a narrative that stretches over nearly fifty years, Paul and Judy Karasik -- he writes with pictures, she with words -- unite to relate the story of their family, their brother David, and the history of their relationship with him. In doing so, each comes to understand the responsibility David represents and the meaning his life gives theirs.  In the pages of The Ride Together, David grows from child to man, remaining dependent on others, even as he witnesses his siblings leaving home -- and him -- for careers and lives of their own. He speaks in a code of his own; he performs his own versions of The Adventures of Superman and Face the Nation; he writes page after page of television synopses.  What he understands of life and death no one can truly tell, yet David walks through his days with dignity and, as it turns out, endurance.  At first glance the adventure of this book is its brilliant experiment of form -- the story of a brother with autism told in a style that is as unusual as the subject matter. But The Ride Together goes deeper than that: It takes a family that may appear strange to some -- like many families with disabilities -- and reveals a group of people whose acceptance of what life has dealt them helps them persevere through good times and bad.  Praised by writers for its craft and by families for its authenticity, The Ride Together provides a remarkable portrait of a family with a difference.",

        "Title": "French Lessons: A Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Kaplan, Alice",
        "Description": "Brilliantly uniting the personal and the critical, French Lessons is a powerful autobiographical experiment. It tells the story of an American woman escaping into the French language and of a scholar and teacher coming to grips with her history of learning. Kaplan begins with a distinctly American quest for an imaginary France of the intelligence. But soon her infatuation with all things French comes up against the dark, unimagined recesses of French political and cultural life.The daughter of a Jewish lawyer who prosecuted Nazi war criminals at Nuremburg, Kaplan grew up in the 1960s in the Midwest. After her father's death when she was seven, French became her way of \"leaving home\" and finding herself in another language and culture. In spare, midwestern prose, by turns intimate and wry, Kaplan describes how, as a student in a Swiss boarding school and later in a junior year abroad in Bordeaux, she passionately sought the French \"r,\" attentively honed her accent, and learned the idioms of her French lover.When, as a graduate student, her passion for French culture turned to the elegance and sophistication of its intellectual life, she found herself drawn to the language and style of the novelist Louis-Ferdinand Celine. At the same time she was repulsed by his anti-Semitism. At Yale in the late 70s, during the heyday of deconstruction she chose to transgress its apolitical purity and work on a subject \"that made history impossible to ignore:\" French fascist intellectuals. Kaplan's discussion of the \"de Man affair\" \u2014 the discovery that her brilliant and charismatic Yale professor had written compromising articles for the pro-Nazi Belgian press\u2014and her personal account of the paradoxes of deconstruction are among the most compelling available on this subject.French Lessons belongs in the company of Sartre's Words and the memoirs of Nathalie Sarraute, Annie Ernaux, and Eva Hoffman. No book so engrossingly conveys both the excitement of learning and the moral dilemmas of the intellectual life.",

        "Description": "First published in Latin in 1516, Utopia was the work of Sir Thomas More (1477\u20131535), the brilliant humanist, scholar, and churchman executed by Henry VIII for his refusal to accept the king as the supreme head of the Church of England.In this work, which gave its name to the whole genre of books and movements hypothesizing an ideal society, More envisioned a patriarchal island kingdom that practiced religious tolerance, in which everybody worked, no one has more than his fellows, all goods were community-owned, and violence, bloodshed, and vice nonexistent. Based to some extent on the writings of Plato and other earlier authors, Utopia nevertheless contained much that was original with More.In the nearly 500 years since the book's publication, there have been many attempts at establishing \"Utopias\" both in theory and in practice. All of them, however, seem to embody ideas already present in More's classic treatise: optimistic faith in human nature, emphasis on the environment and proper education, nostalgia for a lost innocence, and other positive elements.In this new, inexpensive edition, readers can study for themselves the essentials of More's utopian vision and how, although the ideal society he envisioned is still unrealized, at least some of his proposals have come to pass in today's world.",

        "Title": "April 1865: The Month That Saved America",
        "Authors": "By Winik, Jay",
        "Description": "The New York Times bestselling chronicle of the Civil War's final days that will forever change the way we see the war's end and the nation's new beginning. It was a month that could have unravelled the American nation. Instead, it saved it. In April 1865, Jay Winik masterfully breathes new life into the end of a war and the events we only thought we knew. This gripping, panoramic narrative takes readers on a breathless ride through these tumultuous thirty days, showing that the nation's future rested on a few crucial decisions and twists of fate. Here is Richmond's dramatic fall, Lee's harrowing retreat, and the intense debate in Confederate circles over unleashing guerrilla warfare. Here, too, is the rebel surrender at Appomattox, Lincoln's assassination five days later, and the ensuing fears of chaos and a coup, the shaky transfer of presidential power, and finally the start of national reconciliation. Outsized characters stalk through sweeping events in Winik's brilliant narrative, transforming a seeming epilogue to a great war into a central\u682ed saving\u6b2fment in American history, firmly placing April 1865 in the same pantheon as 1492 and 1776.",

        "Description": "The Cambridge Astronomy Guide is intended for lovers of astronomy who wish to do more than just look at the night sky or marvel at glossy pictures of it. It tells you how to get outside and actually practise astronomy, even if you own nothing more than a simple camera. Astronomy, more than any other science, offers amateurs the opportunity to make meaningful and lasting contributions to the field. This Guide explains in simple non-mathematical terms how you can take stunning star photographs and then put them to use making valuable contributions to the science of astronomy. Ben Mayer's odd-numbered chapters provide a fascinating account told with much humour of how one raw amateur got started and quickly progressed to become one of the world's best known and in many ways most successful amateur astronomers. Bill Liller's even-numbered chapters provide a more extensive commentary on much of what Ben writes, plus some additional material which gives the professional point of view.",

        "Description": "Every novel by Tom Clancy has been \"a jaw-tightener and a nail-biter of the first order,\" as the San Diego Union described Without Remorse. But Debt of Honor surpasses them all, with Jack Ryan facing his greatest challenge - against a peril that may become all too real.In retrospect, it would seem an odd way to start a war. . . .The end of history. The new world order. Fine phrases, but as Jack Ryan is about to discover, history isn't dead yet - and only the nature of the threat is new.On the Pacific island of Saipan, a wealthy Japanese businessman regards his new-bought land with satisfaction. In the Indian Ocean off Sri Lanka, a foreign navy begins a series of highly unusual exercises. At the headquarters of America's major stock-clearing corporation, an engineer brings a customized computer program on-line for the first time, and smiles at his own private joke. Three seemingly unrelated incidents, but all just the first links in a chain of events that will stun the world.Called out of retirement to serve as the new President's National Security Advisor, Jack Ryan quickly realizes that the problems of peace are fully as complex as those of war. Enemies have become friends, friends enemies, and even the form of conflict has changed. What he cannot realize, however, is just how close the next conflict is. And when one of those new enemies readies a strike not only at America's territory, but at the heart of her economy, it is Ryan, with the help of CIA officers John Clark and Domingo Chavez, who must prepare an untested President to meet the challenge, if Ryan can only figure out how. For there is a debt of honor to be paid - and the price will be terrifyingly high. . . .",
