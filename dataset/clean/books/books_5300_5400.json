As a probation officer, Ann knows what it means to walk a treacherously thin line between dangerous criminals who have scores to settle - and the system that seeks to punish them. As a wife, she holds closely guarded secrets about her life with her police officer husband, who inexplicably vanished four years ago. And as a woman who has been sexually reawakened by a handsome, hard-driving district attorney after being alone too long, she is haunted by the specter of a mate who may suddenly reappear...and terrified of an unknown enemy who seems to know her every move and thought.The danger is clear to Ann from the moment a bullet hits her while she is leaving work one day. Ironically, the man who comes to her and saves her life is one of the first offenders she is supervising - convicted drug dealer Jimmy Sawyer. What was this smooth-talking, slick-moving, almost too good-looking young man doing at the scene of the shooting?No one is able to help Ann find answers, not her dynamic, career-obsessed lover, or the cops who were buddies of her missing husband and who look on her as prone to shock and fantasy - especially when the evidence of an unspeakable crime she finds in Jimmy Sawyer's house disappears before she can prove it existed. Meanwhile, she is investigating a man accused of a series of brutal rapes, never suspecting his case will have a bearing on her own growing peril.",

As they confided in Father Koesler, their stories about the newly dead man poured out venomously. What might have been a simple, if nontraditional, Catholic wake for the Jewish doctor quickly turned into a maelstrom of animosity.Certainly Jake Cameron was glad Green was dead. As the doctor's partner in a string of nightclubs, Cameron was about to lose everything to the mercenary Green. The doctor's former mistress, Claire, and her fiance, Stan, also felt abused: Claire's single missed period had ended in a secret hysterectomy Green had performed, which included aborting his own child.Then there was Green's daughter, Judith, whose engagement to an African-American attorney was met with blackmail attempts from her father. Green's own wife, Margie, who'd been cut out of her husband's substantial will only days before his death, also felt ill-treated by her physician spouse.But all was not as it appeared at downtown Detroit's old St. Joseph's church. Just before Father Koesler began his generic eulogy for Dr. Green, a miracle occurred, a miracle that everyone agreed was completely undeserved.",

As far as they're concerned, Phyllis's best attribute is that she's a Florida resident, while they live in New York.But then Phyllis decides that retirement and spending the holidays alone in Miami are not for her, and she's going to move back to the Big Apple. Sigourney, Sharon, and Bruce are horrified. They just can't let crazy Phyllis ruin their lives all over again. Murder is out - purely for practical reasons. And Christmas is unbearable enough without a visit from Mom - and what if she stays as she's threatening to do? Sig is a single, stylish, control-freak stockbroker who is terrified of her downsized professional and personal life; Sharon is a neurotic suburban housewife with two young children and an unemployed husband; and Bruce - the baby of the family - is a gay greeting-card entrepreneur whose business is folding faster than you can say \"Queer Santa.\" Phyllis's arrival in New York will be the unraveling of them all. Only Sig has the ideal solution: They'll join forces and marry Mom off. Then she'll be someone else's problem. They call the plan \"Operation Geezer Quest,\" but where are they going to find an old, deaf, dumb, blind, and, above all, rich groom?",

        "Description": "When obsession threatens to consume a man, death can be a relief. Or it can be the beginning of an even more disturbing journeyIn At Sea, Toby Olson once again explores a darker side of love and relationship, this time through the difficulties of characters in a Cape Cod town, where lifestyles mix, and sexual jealousy provokes deadly passions. The result is a complex mystery involving family secrets, brutal assault and death.It is Peter Blue, an undercover narcotics agent in Provincetown, who finds himself at sea. Troubled in his marriage to Sara, drawn to the rape victim, Beth Charters, Peter is torn in his affections. When he takes part in a drug bust that results in the death of a local fisherman, Peter's motives become suspect. When many in the town turn against him, he is put on temporary suspension.Peter leaves Provincetown for safe haven, but when he returns he finds that everything he'd counted on has come apart. A brutal murder raises more questions, creates more doubts. Peter is rescued from a drunken binge by Charlie Glen, the piano player at a local bar; together they set out to unravel the mystery that has developed, one which goes well beyond the recent murder. Their investigations lead them into the past, the underlife of the town's gay bars, out into the dunes of the National Seashore, even to the sea itself. In the end it is as much their own lives that are understood as those of the criminals they've pursued.As in all of Olson's fiction, including the PEN/Faulkner Award-winning Seaview and his most recent Dorit in Lesbos, At Sea explores issues of memory, coercion and sexual ambivalence. But here setting too becomes character, the delicate structures of Provincetown's culture and the natural world that surrounds it serving as a backdrop for the fragile and complex emotions of Peter Blue and those whose lives he touches.At Sea is at once mystery and psychological novel, yet written with the same stylistic elegance, the same care for detail that has become Olson's hallmark. At Sea takes its place with Toby Olson's five previous novels, a body of work that is unique in contemporary American fiction.",

He flies us back to the south of France (a region some readers of his irresistible best-sellers believe him to have invented), on a wild chase through galleries, homes of prominent collectors, and wickedly delectable restaurants. There are stopovers in the Bahamas and England, and in New York, where that glossiest of magazines, Decorating Quarterly, reflects the cutting-edge trendiness of its editor, Camilla Jameson Porter. (Camilla has recently broken new ground in the world of power lunches by booking two tables on the same day, and shuttling between them, at the city's trendiest restaurant.)It is Camilla who has sent our hero, Andre Kelly, to Cap Ferrat to take glamorous photo-graphs of the houses and treasures of the rich, famous, and fatuous. He happens to have his camera at the ready when he spots a C\u00e9zanne being loaded onto a plumber's truck near the home of an absent collector. Odd, thinks Andre. And in no time he's on the trail of a state-of-the-art art scam, chasing C\u00e9zanne.It's a joy to follow him and the crowds intent on speeding or foiling his quest--including a beautiful agent; a super-savvy art dealer attracted to the finer things in life, especially if they promise the payoff of a lifetime; an awesome Dutch forger; some outstandingly greedy New York sophisticates; and, invisible in the background, the parade of remarkable chefs whose mouthwatering culinary masterpieces periodically soothe the hero and tantalize the reader of Chasing C\u00e9zanne.",

With the help of police psychologist Daphne Matthews and Sergeant John LaMoia, Boldt is able to make slow progress cracking the case, and their work leads them to a Denver convict and his brother, a hardened criminal with a record. As things spin out of control, Boldt's worst fears are confirmed when he refuses to drop the investigation, and it's clear his life is in danger because of it. Boldt and Daphne come to realize that the robberies, assaults, and strike are somehow all connected.",

Al provides an unprecedented, intimate look into his experiences with infertility treatments, adoption, and the normal fears and wonders of an expecting parent. As Al manages the needs of his daughters from two marriages and the demands of a high-profile career, he is like millions of others who fantasize about the newest sport utility vehicle, struggle with a GapKids addiction, and bask in the golden moments of first steps and special Father's Day meals. Of course, being a father brings back memories of his own childhood, and Al reminisces about riding his father's bus route in Brooklyn, disobeying his parents' command \"Do not let Andrew watch Psycho,\" and the beginnings of his passion for cartooning. Along the way, Al comes to a deeper understanding of his parents' love for him and a whole new appreciation of them as grandparents.

He also begins to make another, more personal, daring plan. His masterly scheme promises prestige, fame, a small fortune, plus a number of artful deceptions - and a disappearing act that will rival the story of the painting itself.But things intervene in the form of a demanding son, a more demanding and ambitious mistress, an unscrupulous collector, persons suddenly dead, and the fact the Annabel Reed-Smith is asked by her ex-college roommate, now the vice president's wife, to keep an eye on things at the Gallery and the coming exhibition.Murder at the National Gallery is a look inside one of the nation's premier art institutions. It also shows us what goes into the mounting of a major exhibition, involving international trade (legal and otherwise), Customs and customs, government, and art authorities. It provides an up-close portrait of art theft, smuggling, and forgery in several places, including Italy, where they are among the nation's major industries.",

But when he opens an innocuous-looking letter addressed to him at The Source, he discovers that someone else excels at ferreting out secrets as well.Ten-year-old Charlotte Bowen has been abducted, and if Luxford does not admit publicly to having fathered her, she will die. But Charlotte's existence is Luxford's most fiercely guarded secret, and acknowledging her as his child will throw more than one life and career into chaos. Luxford knows that the story of Charlotte's paternity could make him a laughingstock and reveal to his beautiful wife and son the lie he's lived for a decade. Yet it's not only Luxford's reputation that's on the line: it's also the reputation - and career - of Charlotte Bowen's mother. For she is Undersecretary of State for the Home Office, one of the most high-profile Junior Ministers and quite possibly the next Margaret Thatcher.Knowing that her political future hangs in the balance, Eve Bowen refuses to let Luxford damage her career by printing the story or calling the police. So the editor turns to forensic scientist Simon St. James for help. It's a case that fills St. James with disquiet, however, for none of the players in the drama seem to react the way one would expect.",

        "Title": "Upon This Rock: The Miracles of a Black Church",
        "Authors": "By Freedman, Samuel G.",
        "Description": "In the heart of an American city, in a neighborhood of such poverty, crime, and despair that a visiting mayor once called it \"the beginning of the end of our civilization, a remarkable community has come together - a community that has daringly refused to accept a decline that seemed inevitable, a community that has taken command of its own destiny, a community that has come to experience miracles as everyday occasions.In little over a decade, Saint Paul Community Baptist Church has transformed one of New York City's most depressed areas into one that is vital, committed, and thriving. Under the leadership of its dynamic and controversial pastor, Reverend Johnny Ray Youngblood, Saint Paul has successfully shouldered the responsibilities for not only its members' spiritual well-being but also their daily lives. It has built affordable housing, created a school, replaced brothels and numbers joints with family stores. And, through a series of innovative programs, it has rescued even those who have traditionally eluded the black church, from drug abusers to the neighborhood's youth and men. Here is a church that has found the divine in the pulpit and the streets, that has tested and tempered its spirituality in activism.In Upon This Rock, Samuel Freedman, author of the National Book Award finalist Small Victories, chronicles a year in the life of Saint Paul, a year of risks and rewards for the entire congregation. At the center of the narrative is Reverend Youngblood himself, an unconventional minister who confronts his public and private crises with a wisdom informed by worldliness, and who leads the five thousand souls in his care with equal measures of humor and passion. Among those souls we meet a sturdy grandmother who has taken on the care of many of the neighborhood's children; a former addict who uses his own near death as a foundation for guiding others through recovery; two women seeking justice for a senseless slaying; and the church's sole white member, a former Wall Street trader who at Saint Paul found the faith he had lost for years and tested it in an unforgettable first sermon to his fellow congregants.Through these men and women we share the vital struggle to preserve and enrich the integrity of both the individual and the group in the face of what often seem insurmountable odds. The members of Saint Paul offer a message of hope for the present and future, for the extraordinary vision of Reverend Johnny Ray Youngblood offers a viable, encouraging, and inspiring model of how our nation's greatest ills can be addressed.",

The results showed that the city became almost a million pounds lighter. This new, updated, and revised edition of The Rotation Diet offers a scientifically proven maintenance plan that requires only small changes to establish a permanently healthier lifestyle. There are tasty new recipes and menus based on the recently published USDA and HHS dietary guidelines, and numerous examples show how people who have changed their lives achieved success as they built weight-management confidence.",

She does so again, in this deeply moving memoir and plea for peace.A stirring voice from yet another Israeli generation living in turmoil and in danger, Noa, at age nineteen, reflects on her life to date: a childhood scarred by tragedy and rescued by her family's love; a constant fear - fed by random bombings - for the lives of relatives and friends; the chaotic impact of war - Lebanon, the Intifada, the Gulf war; the hate from outside, and now from within, Israel. Noa talks of her grandfather's assassin and the extremists who nourished his violence.She shares her precious memories of her grandfather, with whom she lived until the age of six and to whom she remained close to for the rest of his life. She offers insights into his transformation from soldier to leader to peacemaker, his courageous determination to change the course of the Middle East conflict, and the steps he took in search of a lasting peace for future generations of Israelis. Noa speaks to him, and to the world.",
