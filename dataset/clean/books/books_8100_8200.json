        "Authors": "By Shogan, Robert",
        "Description": "With Hard Bargain, Robert Shogan, the distinguished author of Riddle of Power and None of the Above, offers the definitive account of one of World War II's most dramatic chapters - the inside story of how Franklin D. Roosevelt secretly brokered a deal to provide the destroyers Churchill needed to save Britain from destruction, irrevocably altering the postwar world order. Not fully understood until now, this episode transformed the role of the American presidency and paved Roosevelt's way to a third term.At the center of the momentous events of 1940 are these two extraordinary leaders, whom Shogan brings to vibrant life: Churchill, the forthright pragmatist, and Roosevelt, the suave politician. As Hitler's war machine threatened to starve England into submission, these two men initiated a complex negotiation that would shatter all precedents for conducting foreign policy. FDR yearned to enter the war and defeat Hitler, but he was handcuffed by domestic politics, including his need to win a third term. Churchill had to plead for American intervention at a time when the United States was intensely isolationist. Drawing on archives on both sides of the Atlantic, Shogan masterfully re-creates the President's maneuvers as FDR stepped around the Constitution in order to cinch the deal, a move that has had repercussions from Korea to Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.Told with novelistic flair, Hard Bargain is a riveting contribution to history and a penetrating analysis of the abuses of presidential power.",

        "Title": "Learning a Trade: A Craftsman\u2019s Notebooks: 1955-1997",
        "Authors": "By Price, Reynolds",
        "Description": "From Reynolds Price, much acclaimed author of award-winning novels, plays, poems, stories, and essays, comes a work that is unique among contemporary writers of American literature. For more than forty years, Price has kept a working journal of his writing life. Now published for the first time, Learning a Trade provides a revealing window into this writer\u2019s creative process and craftsman\u2019s sensibilities. Whether Price is reflecting on the rhythm of his day-to-day writing process or ruminating about the central character in what would become, for instance, Kate Vaiden\u2014should she be a woman, what would be her name, why would the story be told in the first person?\u2014he envelops the reader in the task at hand, in the trade being practiced. Instead of personal memoir or a collection of literary fragments, Learning a Trade presents what Price has called the \u201congoing minutes\u201d of his effort to learn his craft. Equally enlightening as an overview of a career of developing prominence or as a perspective on the building of individual literary works, this volume not only allows the reader to hear the author\u2019s internal dialogue on the hundreds of questions that must be turned and mulled during the planning and writing of a novel but, in an unplanned way, creates its own compelling narrative.These notebooks begin in \u201cthat distant summer in dazed Eisenhower America,\u201d a month after Price\u2019s graduation from Duke University, and conclude in \u201cthe raucous millennial present\u201d with plans for his most recent novel, Roxanna Slade. Revealing the genesis and resolution of such works as The Surface of Earth, The Source of Light, Kate Vaiden, Clear Pictures, and Blue Calhoun, Learning a Trade offers a rich reward to those seeking to enter the guild of writers, as well as those intrigued by the process of the literary life or captured by the work of Reynolds Price.",

        "Authors": "By Hess, Stephen",
        "Description": "In the vast literature on the way democratic governments work, the role of the press is often overlooked. Yet the press, no less than the formal branches of government, is a public policy institution and deserves to be included in explanations of the governmental process.  In The Washington Reporters, Stephen Hess focuses on those who cover the U.S. government for the American commercial news media. His book is based on interviews with reporters and editors and on responses to questionnaires from nearly half of the over 1,200 American reporters in Washington. Analysis of these responses and comparison with the content and placement of over 2,000 of these reporters' news stories permit an unusual&#151;and sometimes startling&#151;perspective on Washington newswork. Mr. Hess demonstrates, for instance, how information in the news regularly comes from the legislative branch of the government, despite the greater number of stories on the presidency; and he shows that Washington news dominates the front pages of daily newspapers across the country, no matter how little may be going on in the nation's capital.  The author concludes that \"Washington news gathering fragments [media] power, while at the same time it shifts decisions on what is news and how it should be covered to the reporters.\" The import of this impression is that \"reporters are not simply passing along information; they are choosing, within certain limits, what most people will know about government. The freedom given and assumed by these news workers affects the shape of national affairs.\"",

        "Description": "The Victorian Era (1837-1901) produced a tremendous outpouring of beautifully designed objects for domestic use - from finely crafted, handmade decorative art pieces to humble, machine-made household work tools. We treasure them all today as Victoriana: objects handed down from generation to generation, collected for their nostalgic, aesthetic, and investment value, displayed in museums and historic house restorations, and copied by commerical manufacturers of authentic reproductions.Victorian Treasures is a houseful of these beloved objects, a sumptuous photo album organized into six chapters, each devoted to a separate room in a typical Victorian house: the parlor, library, dining room, kitchen, bedroom, and nursery. The book presents a selection of 200 superb examples of both English and American Victoriana, from the familiar, such as highly collectible painted biscuit tins and silver matchsafes, to the esoteric and arcane, such as the mysterious hair receiver and the blessed birthing scissors.The extended captions that accompany the photos provide curious and entertaining information about the life of the Victorian home: how (and where) one bathed; what the children were allowed to eat; who sat where at the dinner table; and what really went on in the library.Like the objects it collects, Victorian Treasures is both beautiful and useful. An informal cultural history, it is an indispensable guide and a charming companion for all lovers of Victoriana - collectors, dealers, flea market shoppers and the proud owners of old family heirlooms.",

        "Title": "Sacred America: The Emerging Spirit of the People",
        "Authors": "By Housden, Roger",
        "Description": "Sacred America, in lucid and poetic prose, is the story of ordinary people who have dared to follow and trust the voices of their own souls in the midst of everyday life in the United States. It is also the story of another America, one not seen on the nightly news. What Roger Housden finds on his journey across the country suggests to him that, contrary to popular belief, the United States is among the most creative and spiritually vibrant cultures on earth. Sacred America is his proof.  Just as Alexis de Tocqueville set out across our country in search of democracy, so too did Housden, an Englishman, travel throughout the United States in the waning years of the twentieth century in search of this country's heart. He discovered that, despite or perhaps due to the moral turpitude of Wall Street and Capitol Hill, the spirit of the American people is flourishing. Americans are continually redefining what it means to be human, what they want from democracy, and, most important, how a democratic society is an expression of the sacred.  As an outsider, Housden was both surprised and impressed by what he found -- the extent to which the aspirations, genius, actions, wisdom, and compassion of people in all walks of life are woven into the social and cultural fabric of America. For Housden, this presence of Being in the midst of everyday life, rather than in formal places of worship (though he found it there too), is reinventing what a sense of the sacred means for the American individual at the turn of the millennium.  Sacred America acknowledges that a spiritual materialism prospers here to an extent that would stagger any European mind; spiritual techniques and teachings have become major product lines along with everything else. Yet Housden also finds a genuine human spirit flourishing, found in small-town Wyoming, on a bus ride to Manhattan, on a remote Indian reservation, in an artist's cave in New Mexico, in the life of a letter carrier in California, and even in Hollywood. Further, he finds groups of people coming together to share their various faiths in a truly open spirit: at Wellesley College in Massachusetts; among the politicians of Washington, D.C.; at Habitat for Humanity; at a retreat center for ex-cons in North Carolina; as well as in churches, at an Islamic conference, in Buddhist meditation centers, and in the traditional Hispanic faith in northern New Mexico.  What is significant, Housden discovers, is that no one is in charge of this emergence of the human spirit. No one is doing it. This other America -- so different from the image that much of the world holds of this country -- is not a cause that you fight for or a movement orchestrated by any religious or spiritual denomination. It is something at work, Housden suggests, in the collective psyche. It is something we participate in, rather than direct or control. A broader intelligence is at work not as some external force acting on us but from within us as a collective. It is changing the way Americans feel about themselves, restoring a sense of meaning and moral authority to the wellspring of individual conscience -- Housden calls it the intelligence of the knowing heart. Sacred America is emerging, Housden concludes, as that growing community of individuals who are interconnected not by the external dictate of creed or culture but by the prompting of the heart's intelligence.",

The defining moment in her life comes when she stands and promises to deepen her commitment and follow Christ, no matter the cost. So begins a remarkable journey of resolve, winding through valleys of loss and deserts of testing toward a legacy of faith. Two world wars, the Great Depression, and devastating personal loss form the backdrop for a lifetime of walking with God despite all odds. Though None Go with Me is a powerful novel depicting one courageous woman&apos; determination to stand faithful in all circumstances. It is a moving saga of forgiveness and peace amidst the loves, trials, and joys of an American family. And ultimately, it is a portrait of the far-reaching impact of a life that fully embraces the steadfast promises of God. Jerry Jenkins weaves a tale of yesterday that speaks with immediacy, conviction, and encouragement to the lives we live today.",

        "Description": "For decades, astronomers have sought to discover the ultimate fate of the univers. Will the cosmos continue forever in its expansion, which began billions of years ago with the big bang? Or will gravity someday reverse the process, producing a \"big crunch?\" Within the past few years, two rival groups of astronomers have announced a discovery that seems to resolve the issue: Instead of slowing down, the expansion of the universe seems to be accelerating. This finding has shaken the science of cosmology to its very foundation. This is the story of the astronomers who have stood the world of cosmology on its ear--and of their competitive race to discover the future of the cosmos. It is also an investigation into whether their remarkable findings will stand the test of time. If the new results are verified in the coming years, we will eventually find ourselves in a \"runaway universe,\" in which every bit of matter is extremely far from its closest neighbor. Then the cosmological constant, which Einstein once rued as his \"greatest blunder,\" will turn out to be one of his finest insights into the nature of space itself.A vivid picture of an unexpected turn of events, The Runaway Universe presents the startling new discovery that is revolutionizing our view of the cosmos.",

        "Description": "A deluxe illustrated edition of one of the most beloved books of our time, with nearly 150 historic photographs personally selected by the authorThe spellbinding true story of how three men and a great racehorse captivated a nation, Laura Hillenbrand\u2019s Seabiscuit: An American Legend became an immediate number one bestseller and cultural phenomenon upon its publication in 2001. Named one of the best books of the year by more than twenty publications\u2014including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Time, People, USA Today, and The Economist\u2014Seabiscuit was also honored as the BookSense Nonfiction Book of the Year and the William Hill Sports Book of the Year, and was a finalist for several other major prizes, including the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. For this lavishly illustrated special edition, author Laura Hillenbrand has written a new Introduction and selected nearly 150 rare photographs from historic archives and private collections. Seabiscuit tells the story of three remarkable men: Charles Howard, a bicycle repairman who made a fortune by introducing the automobile to the American West; Red Pollard, a failed prizefighter and failing jockey who was abandoned as a boy at a makeshift racetrack; and Tom Smith, an enigmatic mustang breaker who came from the vanishing frontier, bearing generations of lost wisdom about the secrets of horses.      In the sultry summer of 1936, the lives of these men converged around a bad-legged, floundering racehorse named Seabiscuit. Forming an improbable partnership, they transformed the horse into one of the most extraordinary competitors in sports history. In four tumultuous years, the rags-to-riches horse overcame a phenomenal run  of misfortune to emerge as an American cultural icon, drawing an immense following, prompting an avalanche of merchandising, and establishing himself as the single biggest newsmaker of 1938\u2014receiving more coverage than FDR, Hitler, or any other public figure.Seabiscuit is an inspiring tale of unlikely heroes, a classic story of three embattled individuals  and a remarkable racehorse overcoming the odds in the Great Depression.",

Graphic artist Ed Sibbett has brilliantly captured the intricacy and beauty of this original art tradition in 37 drawings based on illustrations in the Book of Durrow, the Gospels of St. Willibrord, and the illustrious Book of Kells. Among the motifs are the characteristic Celtic interlacings, geometric-animal combinations, and decorative initials, plus powerful ornaments and symbolic abstractions of animals and people. A portrait of St. Matthew appears as a centerspread, not backed up, that may be taken out and framed. Captions identify the source of each picture and explain the iconography.",

        "Description": "Despite our growing kitchen savvy, many Americans still find French food too intimidating, too time-consuming, and too complicated. Richard Grausman, a well-known teacher of French cooking, has had a long-time mission to dispel this fear and make French cooking accessible and understandable to the American home cook. The result? AT HOME WITH THE FRENCH CLASSICS.  This compendium of over 250 classic and traditional French dishes offers recipes that are not only approachable, but are also geared to the contemporary American lifestyle. The author has cut back on salt, fat, eggs, butter, and cream without any loss of authenticity or taste. The recipes have been streamlined by the use of modern appliances. Certain classic techniques, which are neither sensible for the modern kitchen nor vital for the recipe's success, have been revised or eliminated. Mediterranean Fish Soup. Roquefort Cheese Souffle. Zucchini stuffed with Mushrooms and Ham. Broiled Baby Chickens with Herbs and Mustard. Poached Chicken with Creamy Tarragon Sauce. Pepper-Coated Steak with Cognac and Cream. Rack of Lamb with Watercress. And for dessert, Pears Poached in Port Wine, Chocolate Mousse, and Rich Vanilla and Chocolate Custards. Starting with first courses and ending with after-dinner chocolates, the book contains dozens of possibilities for entertaining. Many of the dishes can be made ahead of time. Others can be made in stages, from days to weeks in advance. Selection of Better Homes & Gardens Family Book Service and Book-of-the-Month Cooking & Crafts Club. 82,000 copies in print.",
