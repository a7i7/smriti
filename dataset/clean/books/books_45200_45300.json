Amabelle Desir, Haitian-born and a faithful maidservant to the Dominican family that took her in when she was orphaned, and her lover Sebastien, an itinerant sugarcane cutter, decide they will marry and return to Haiti at the end of the cane season. However, hostilities toward Haitian laborers find a vitriolic spokesman in the ultra-nationalist Generalissimo Trujillo who calls for an ethnic cleansing of his Spanish-speaking country. As rumors of Haitian persecution become fact, as anxiety turns to terror, Amabelle and Sebastien's dreams are leveled to the most basic human desire: to endure.    Based on a little-known historical event, this extraordinarily moving novel memorializes the forgotten victims of nationalist madness and the deeply felt passion and grief of its survivors.",

        "Authors": "By Karnow, Stanley and Karnow, Annette (ILT)",
        "Description": "In July 1947, fresh out of college and long before he would win the Pulitzer Prize and become known as one of America's finest historians, Stanley Karnow boarded a freighter bound for France, planning to stay for the summer. He stayed for ten years, first as a student and later as a correspondent for Time magazine. By the time he left, Karnow knew Paris so intimately that his French colleagues dubbed him \"le plus parisien des Am\u00e9ricains\" --the most Parisian American. Now, Karnow returns to the France of his youth, perceptively and wittily illuminating a time and place like none other. Karnow came to France at a time when the French were striving to return to the life they had enjoyed before the devastation of World War II. Yet even during food shortages, political upheavals, and the struggle to come to terms with a world in which France was no longer the mighty power it had been, Paris remained a city of style, passion, and romance. Paris in the Fifties transports us to Latin Quarter caf\u00e9s and basement jazz clubs, to unheated apartments and glorious ballrooms. We meet such prominent political figures as Charles de Gaulle and Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France, as well as Communist hacks and the demagogic tax rebel Pierre Poujade. We get to know illustrious intellectuals, among them Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, and Andr\u00e9 Malraux, and visit the glittering salons where aristocrats with exquisite manners mingled with trendy novelists, poets, critics, artists, composers, playwrights, and actors. We meet Christian Dior, who taught Karnow the secrets of haute couture, and Prince Curnonsky, France's leading gourmet, who taught the young reporter to appreciate the complexities of haute cuisine. Karnow takes us to marathon murder trials in musty courtrooms, accompanies a group of tipsy wine connoisseurs on a tour of the Beaujolais vineyards, and recalls the famous automobile race at Le Mans when a catastrophic accident killed more than eighty spectators. Back in Paris, Karnow hung out with visiting celebrities like Ernest Hemingway, Orson Welles, and Audrey Hepburn, and in Paris in the Fifties we meet them too.A veteran reporter and historian, Karnow has written a vivid and delightful history of a charmed decade in the greatest city in the world.",

He's Jon Miller, and in this candid, funny, forthright volume he tells us why baseball is the greatest game and why -- despite the counterproductive comments of owners and players -- it will continue to be well into the twenty-first century.  In Confessions of a Baseball Purist, Miller takes us on a journey into the heart of baseball as he's seen it from the best seat in the house. He brings to life the emotion of the night Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive games played record, the history-soaked drama when the Giants and Dodgers faced off in a crucial pennant-race series in September '97, Eddie Murray's fitting return to the Orioles to hit his 500th home run, and the day Edward Bennett Williams -- owner of the Orioles -- approved the plans for the creation of Camden Yards. But Jon doesn't shy from pointing a finger at the darker forces at work in the game: the insanity of not having a real commissioner; the follies of radical realignment and excessive reliance on novelties like widespread interleague play; the old-time players and broadcasters -- including his good friend and partner Joe Morgan -- who don't accept that today's players are bigger, faster, stronger, and better; players who denigrate the game, not realizing that by doing so they're insulting their own fans; and owners and general managers who can't make a move without discussing the economic ramifications, even though that's the last thing their fans (or, to use the owners' term, their customer base) want to hear about.  With charming candor and disarming wit, Miller takes us from the broadcaster's booth into the stands and down onto the field and into the dugout. He pays tribute to his heroes and his partners, who include some of the classic voices that shaped his love of the game: Russ Hodges and Lon Simmons, Vin Scully, Hank Greenwald, Chuck Thompson, and Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek. He tells about the Opening Day rain delay that launched a second career as an after-dinner speaker in Boston, as his partner Ken Coleman led him into doing his now-famous Vin Scully impersonation; the maddening experience of working for Charles O. Finley, an owner who managed the remarkable feat of building a World Championship team that finished next-to-last in the league in home attendance; and the pleasure of being a part of the growth and development of ESPN Sunday Night Baseball into the game's weekly showcase for a nationwide audience. He profiles some of his favorite baseball personalities, from Reggie Jackson and Kirby Puckett to Alvin Dark and Charles Steinberg; shares inside stories from the broadcast booth about the secrets of Phil Rizzuto's scorebook (\"WW\" means \"Wasn't Watching\") and what to do when your partner is knocked cold by a foul line drive; and tells, for the first time, the story behind his leaving the Baltimore Orioles after fourteen years doing the team's games.  True to the broadcaster's art, Confessions of a Baseball Purist calls the game the way Jon Miller sees it: with wit, with style, and with absolute candor. For the baseball purist in all of us, Miller provides a rallying cry, some warm memories, and reasons to keep believing in the",

        "Authors": "By Campbell, T. Colin, Ph.D.",
        "Description": "Even today, as trendy diets and a weight-loss frenzy sweep the nation, two-thirds of adults are still obese and children are being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, typically an \u201cadult\u201d disease, at an alarming rate. If we\u2019re obsessed with being thin more so than ever before, why are Americans stricken with heart disease as much as we were 30 years ago?In The China Study, Dr. T. Colin Campbell details the connection between nutrition and heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The report also examines the source of nutritional confusion produced by powerful lobbies, government entities, and opportunistic scientists. The New York Times has recognized the study as the \u201cGrand Prix of epidemiology\u201d and the \u201cmost comprehensive large study ever undertaken of the relationship between diet and the risk of developing disease.\u201dThe China Study is not a diet book. Dr. Campbell cuts through the haze of misinformation and delivers an insightful message to anyone living with cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and those concerned with the effects of aging.[This book is also available in Spanish, El Estudio de China.]",

        "Authors": "By Lewis, C. S.",
        "Description": "\"We need others physically, emotionally, intellectually; we need them if we are to know anything, even ourselves.\"We hear often that love is patient and kind, not envious or prideful. We hear that human love is a reflection of divine love. We hear that God is love. But how do we understand its work in our lives, its perils and rewards? Here, the incomparable C. S. Lewis examines human love in four forms: affection, the most basic, general, and emotive; friendship, the most rare, least jealous, and, in being freely chosen, perhaps the most profound; Eros, passionate love that can run counter to happiness and poses real danger; charity, the greatest, most spiritual, and least selfish. Proper love is a risk, but to bar oneself from it--to deny love--is a damning choice. Love is a need and a gift; love brings joy and laughter. We must seek to be awakened and so to find an Appreciative love through which \"all things are possible.\"\"The Four Loves deserves to become a minor classic as a modern mirror of our souls, a mirror of the virtues and failings of human loving.\" \u2014New York Times Book Review \"Lewis has a keen eye, a large measure of human sympathy, wit, and a command of simple words.\" \u2014Times Literary Supplement C. S. (Clive Staples) Lewis (1898-1963), one of the great writers of the twentieth century, also continues to be one of our most influential Christian thinkers. He wrote more than thirty books, both popular and scholarly, including The Chronicles of Narnia series, The Screwtape Letters, The Four Loves, Mere Christianity, and Surprised by Joy.",

Mar\u00e7al works there as a security guard, and Cipriano drives him to work each day before delivering his own humble pots and jugs.

        "Authors": "By Center for Strategic and International Studies (Washington, D. C.) (COR), Johnston, Douglas (EDT), and Sampson, Cynthia (EDT)",
        "Description": "As the Cold War era becomes history, we are entering an age when international conflict is increasingly based on racial, ethnic, national, and religious clashes--the most intractable sources of conflict, and those with which conventional diplomacy is least suited to deal. The particularly American tendency to separate political from spiritual life often tends to ignore a vital aspect of international relations--one that can be a powerful tool in negotiations. Religion plays a crucial role in many international conflicts, yet for the most part, diplomacy either ignores or misunderstands its role. This unified collection of case studies and theoretical pieces attempts to restore this missing dimension to its rightful place in the conduct of international diplomacy. Sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., this study offers the first systematic account of modern cases in which religious or spiritual factors have played a helpful role in preventing or resolving conflict and achieving non-violent socio-political change. Written by a distinguished roster of scholars, the cases presented span the globe, with examples from Europe, Central America, Asia, and Africa. Additional essays summarize the findings of these case studies to bring out their implications for foreign policy and the religious community.   In the Foreword, former President Jimmy Carter states that the book \"poses a challenge to diplomats and politicians, religious figures and laypersons, analysts and academics alike.\" Conceived to help call attention to and reinforce the positive contribution that religious and spiritual influences can bring to peacemaking, this important study offers practical guidelines for the future application of this kind of peacemaking in existing and incipient conflict situations.",

        "Authors": "By Kandinsky, Wassily",
        "Description": "A pioneering work in the movement to free art from its traditional bonds to material reality, this book is one of the most important documents in the history of modern art. Written by the famous nonobjective painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866\u20131944), it explains Kandinsky's own theory of painting and crystallizes the ideas that were influencing many other modern artists of the period. Along with his own groundbreaking paintings, this book had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art.Kandinsky's ideas are presented in two parts. The first part, called \"About General Aesthetic,\" issues a call for a spiritual revolution in painting that will let artists express their own inner lives in abstract, non-material terms. Just as musicians do not depend upon the material world for their music, so artists should not have to depend upon the material world for their art. In the second part, \"About Painting,\" Kandinsky discusses the psychology of colors, the language of form and color, and the responsibilities of the artist. An Introduction by the translator, Michael T. H. Sadler, offers additional explanation of Kandinsky's art and theories, while a new Preface by Richard Stratton discusses Kandinsky's career as a whole and the impact of the book. Making the book even more valuable are nine woodcuts by Kandinsky himself that appear at the chapter headings.This English translation of \u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst was a significant contribution to the understanding of nonobjectivism in art. It continues to be a stimulating and necessary reading experience for every artist, art student, and art patron concerned with the direction of 20th-century painting.",

Now, in what may be his most suspenseful and heartfelt novel ever, he brings us the story of an ordinary man whose extraordinary commitment to his wife will take him on a harrowing journey of adventure, sacrifice, and redemption to the mystery of love itself\u2014and to a showdown with the darkness that would destroy it forever.What would you do for love? Would you die? Would you kill?  We have your wife. You can get her back for two million cash. Landscaper Mitchell Rafferty thinks it must be some kind of joke. He was in the middle of planting impatiens in the yard of one of his clients when his cell phone rang. Now he\u2019s standing in a normal suburban neighborhood on a bright summer day, having a phone conversation out of his darkest nightmare.Whoever is on the other end of the line is dead serious. He has Mitch\u2019s wife and he\u2019s named the price for her safe return. The caller doesn\u2019t care that Mitch runs a small two-man landscaping operation and has no way of raising such a vast sum. He\u2019s confident that Mitch will find a way. If he loves his wife enough. . .  Mitch does love her enough. He loves her more than life itself. He\u2019s got  seventy-two hours to prove it. He has to find the two million by then. But he\u2019ll pay a lot more. He\u2019ll pay anything.From its tense opening to its shattering climax, The Husband is a thriller that will hold you in its relentless grip for every twist, every shock, every revelation\u2026until it lets you go, unmistakably changed. This is a Dean Koontz novel, after all.  And there\u2019s no other experience quite like it.",

More than anything John Kerry, George Bush, or even Karl Rove did, the media's miscoverage of the campaign decided the election. Most disturbingly, the problems with the election coverage reflect long-term problems with U.S. journalism.John Nichols and Robert W. McChesney, two of the country's foremost media analysts and founders of the national media reform group Free Press, dissect the troubling trends in journalism that surfaced in 2004the decline in resources and standards for political journalism and the organized campaign by the political right to control the news cycle. They show how government decisions made without the informed consent of the American people have led to a media system that undermines democracy.Including newsmaking interviews with John Kerry, Howard Dean, Barack Obama, and other key players in the political process, this book is both an expose and a call to action.",

        "Authors": "By Martin, Judith and Duffy, Daniel Mark (ILT)",
        "Description": "With the entire nation screaming for a return to civility, Miss Manners, the highest authority, takes matters into her own properly gloved hands and puts etiquette where it belongs - on the public agenda. Miss Manners Rescues Civilization is a wise, witty and startling examination of how the breakdown of etiquette is contributing to the disintegration of our society.Even the government finds itself battered by our national epidemic of rudeness, yet the very politicians who cry loudest for civility fail to understand the roots of the problem. Using a combination of essays and answers to her Gentle Readers' questions, Miss Manners examines society's ever-rising level of irritation, from the classroom to the caucus room. She shows the crucial role of etiquette in such contemporary issues as political correctness, multiculturalism, sexual harassment, educational failure and freedom of speech.Miss Manners leads the charge toward a livable future rather than a return to the etiquette of past eras. But calling for civility without etiquette is like asking for morality without law, she says. Idealists who mistakenly reject etiquette as snobbish, repressive and dishonest fail to understand that manners form the philosophical basis for civilized life. As society's common language of behavior, manners have always functioned as the modest partner of morality to protect the dignity of everyone, especially society's less powerful members.",

But our friends back home live an existence under the weight and awareness of times; a place we are slowly escaping; a world growing fainter by the hour and the mile.\"Day 13: \"It feels again that we are leaving who we were, moving on into the people we will become, hopefully, people with some kind of answers, some kind of thing to believe tht makes sense of beauty, of romance. Something that would explain the red glow against Paul's face, the red glow that seems to be coming off the console . . . 'Did you notice the engine light is lit, bud?' I ask . . .\"Day 83: \"I sit in the van, waiting for her to come out when I notice a window in one of the classrooms open, and a backpack comes falling out, spilling a few books onto the lawn. After the backpack comes Elida, falling atop the pack and laying low, peeking back into the window to see if the teacher noticed. She gathers her books, reaches into the classroom and closes the window, then runs toward the van as though this were a prison break.\"As you read Through Painted Deserts, you'll soon realize this is not just one man's account of finding light, God, and beauty on the open road. Rather, this book maps the journey you're already traveling\u00a0. . . or soon will be.",

In America's Secret War, George Friedman identifies the United States\u2019 most dangerous enemies, delves into presidential strategies of the last quarter century, and reveals the real reasons behind the attack of 9/11\u2014and the Bush administration\u2019s motivation for the war in Iraq. It describes in eye-opening detail America\u2019s covert and overt efforts in the global war against terrorism: Not only are U.S. armies in combat on every continent, but since 9/11 the intelligence services of dozens of nations have been operating in close partnership with the CIA.Drawing\u00a0on his\u00a0vast information-gathering network, Friedman presents an insightful picture of today\u2019s world that goes far beyond what is reported on television and in other news media. Al Qaeda\u2019s war plans and how they led to 9/11The threat of a suitcase nuclear bomb in New York and how that changed the course of the war.The deal the U.S. made with Russia and Iran which made the invasion of Afghanistan possible \u2013 and how those deals affect the United States today.How fear and suspicion of the Saudis after 9-11 tore apart the Bush-Saudi relationship and why Saudi Arabia\u2019s closest friends in the administration became the Saudi\u2019s worst enemies.The real reasons behind George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq and how WMD became the cover for a much deeper game.How the CIA miscalculated about Saddam Hussein\u2019s and Iran\u2019s real plans, leaving the U.S. bogged down in the war.How the war in Iraq began with a ruse, pretending that a \u201ctarget of opportunity\u201d attack on Saddam Hussein had presented itself. The real story about why the U.S. raises and lowers its alert status and why the United States can\u2019t find and destroy al Qaeda.The strategic successes that are slowly leading the United States to victoryAmerica's Secret War is an unprecedented look at the new world war being waged behind-the-scenes today. It is sure to stir debate and capture headlines around the world.",

Steeped in the traditions of its classic forebears, yet boldly original in its vision and sense of wonder, The Tower of Shadows swells with heroism, sings with enchantment, and carries the reader at full gallop into a marvelously wrought world of breathtaking adventure.Untold ages ago, vainglorious spirits battled with the three gods in a bid for dominion over all\u2013only to be defeated and banished below the earth to fester in their unquenchable evil. One of these vengeful demons eventually broke free and rained bloody death upon an innocent village in the land of Ellynrie. Few survived. The Starcross brothers, mere children orphaned by their parents\u2019 slaughter, suffered very difficult fates. Corin Starcross was delivered to safety by the wizard Dale, while his brother, Cade, was abandoned to the flames that devoured their childhood home. Likewise, the mercenary Wren Tident saved his infant daughter, Kayla, from the monstrous fate that claimed her mother. When the demon retreated to its black abyss, the haunted souls left in its murderous wake did their best to carry on\u2013save for one, who vowed retribution.When Cade Starcross reappears, he immerses himself in a secret study of the blackest arts, and a grim dance of destiny begins. His humanity withered by grief and his mind twisted by his apprenticeship to darkness, Cade seeks to use sorcery to wreak vengeance on his demon nemesis. But in order to succeed, a dagger of unearthly power wrought by the gods themselves must be found. And the blood of Cade\u2019s brother, Corin Starcross, must be spilled.Yet all of Cade\u2019s fury and magic will prove no match for the evil set free upon the earth. By any means and at all costs, the doomed vendetta must be stopped. A fledgling wizard, a tormented warrior, and a young girl burning with her father\u2019s untamed spirit must rally together as the only hope of a world poised perilously at the abyss.",

Now, wielding all the power and magic of a master storyteller at the pinnacle of his craft, Dean Koontz follows Odd into a singular new world where he hopes to make a fresh beginning\u2014but where he will meet an adversary as old and inexorable as time itself.St. Bartholomew\u2019s Abbey sits in majestic solitude amid the wild peaks of California\u2019s high Sierra, a haven for children otherwise abandoned, and a sanctuary for those seeking insight. Odd Thomas has come here to learn to live fully again, and among the eccentric monks, their other guests, and the nuns and young students of the attached convent school, he has begun to find his way. The silent spirits of the dead who visited him in his earlier life are mercifully absent, save for the bell-ringing Brother Constantine and Odd\u2019s steady companion, the King of Rock 'n' Roll.But trouble has a way of finding Odd Thomas, and it slinks back onto his path in the form of the sinister bodachs he has met previously, the black shades who herald death and disaster, and who come late one December night to hover above the abbey\u2019s most precious charges. For Odd is about to face an enemy who eclipses any he has yet encountered, as he embarks on a journey of mystery, wonder, and sheer suspense that surpasses all that has come before.",

She is Abby Douglas, an investment advisor who has enticed many men. No commitments.  No regrets. No games. Then she meets a dangerously sexy stranger in the elevator of her office building - and suddenly she's submitting to the kind of raw fantasies no respectable businesswoman should ever consider. He is club owner Zac Bordina, stunned to find such a receptive partner between floors. But Abby's also the brains behind his company's investments, and she doesn't even know it. Now Zac isn't sure what to tell Abby first-his growing feelings for her, or their secret connection. Either way, from London to Paris, it's business and pleasure for the both of them.",
