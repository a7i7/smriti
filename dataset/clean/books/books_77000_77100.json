        "Description": "From Elie Wiesel, a profoundly moving novel about the healing power of compassion.Gamaliel Friedman is only a child when his family flees Czechoslovakia in 1939 for the relative safety of Hungary. For him, it will be the beginning of a life of rootlessness, disguise, and longing. Five years later, in desperation, Gamaliel\u2019s parents entrust him to a young Christian cabaret singer named Ilonka. With his Jewish identity hidden, he survives the war, but in 1956, to escape the stranglehold of communism, he leaves Budapest after painfully parting with Ilonka.He settles in Vienna, then Paris, and finally, after a failed marriage, in New York, where he works as a ghostwriter, living through the lives of others. Eventually, he falls in with a group of exiles: a Spanish Civil War veteran, a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto, a victim of Stalinism, a former Israeli intelligence agent, and a rabbi\u2014a mystic whose belief in the potential for grace in everyday life powerfully counters Gamaliel\u2019s feelings of loss and dispossession. When Gamaliel is asked to help draw out an elderly, disfigured Hungarian woman who is barely able to communicate but who may be his beloved Ilonka, he begins to understand that a real life in the present is possible only if he will reconcile with his past.Aching, unsentimental, deeply affecting, and thought-provoking, The Time of the Uprooted is the work of a master.",

As human beings, the two men could hardly have been more different. Edward, a lover of fine food, drink, beautiful women, and the pleasure-seeking culture of Paris, had previously been regarded as nothing more than a playboy. Across the Atlantic, Theodore Roosevelt, the aristocrat from Manhattan and self-made cowboy, would rise above his critics to become one of the nation?s most beloved presidents. Together, they wrote the agenda for the North Atlantic democracies of the twentieth century.",

Why in the 18th century version of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" did the wolf eat the child at the end? What did the anonymous townsman of Montpelier have in mind when he kept an exhaustive dossier on all the activities of his native city? These are some of the provocative questions Robert Darnton attempts to answer in this dazzling series of essays that probe the ways of thought in what we like to call \"The Age of Enlightenment.\"",

Examined up close, throughout his meteoric and ever-fascinating (if tragically brief) life, Hamilton can at last be seen as one of the most crucial of the founders.

Now Iris is in a new town with no job, has a divorce on the horizon and only one friend to speak of-a wild-child named Val.

Soon she has a whole new business on her hands - spying on men for the doubting women in their lives. Things get complicated when Vickie's husband Steve catches on to the fact that their coincidental meetings aren't coincidental at all. Not to mention how Steve makes her heart race.

Best-selling novelists, historians, science writers, and journalists, most of these authors are well known--Herman Wouk, James Michener, Alex Haley, Russell Baker, Edward L. Beach, Carl Rowan, Lewis Thomas, Ben Bradlee, Sloan Wilson, C. Vann Woodward, Louis Auchincloss, and Samuel Eliot Morison, to name a few. But readers may not be aware of their wartime service at sea.The selected authors write about duty on all kinds of ships--from carriers to submarines and LSTs--and service in all theaters and at all periods of the war, from beginning to end. They recount a variety of experiences: flight training, submarine attacks, kamikaze hits, surface engagements, amphibious landings, storms, homesickness, nights on the town, leadership challenges, personality conflicts. Most wrote after years of reflection and decades spent polishing their writing skills.Filled with humor, hope, sadness, and occasionally wonder, these autobiographical accounts of war at sea are unparalleled in the quality of the writing and the collective scope of the vision.",

Now technology has reached down into the abstract realm of the atom, and made it accessible to our eyes and fingertips. We have learned to catch, photograph, touch, and even modify atoms one by one. Thus, for the first time since the philosopher Democritus imagined it more than two thousand years ago, the atomic landscape has been revealed in lavish beauty, as in the cover illustration from the scanning tunneling micrograph shown below, which depicts a baker's dozen of iodine atoms bonded together in six-fold symmetry, with a gaping hole glowing yellow where one of their number is missing.",

The story provides an ominous foretaste of the gathering threat of political chaos and totalitarianism.

        "Description": "\"I was touched by the depth of passion and awed by the firm resolve with which Mattie Stepanek pursued a dream that has evaded men and women throughout history. What began as a casual discourse, not too different from others I have had with inquisitive young people who have reached out to me, became a treasured and enlightening friendship that changed my life forever. With the purity of heart that only a child can possess, and the indomitable spirit of one who has survived more physical suffering than most adults will ever know, Mattie convinced me that his quest was not inconceivable. Inspired by his enthusiasm and without reservation, I committed to a partnership with him. . . . These words of wisdom and inspiration came from the most remarkable person I have ever known.\" --Jimmy Carter\u00a0Sometimes the most important messages come from the most unlikely places. Mattie J.T. Stepanek, a 13-year-old boy, made a difference before he died with his Heartsongs poetry. He continues to impact the world through Just Peace. This poet, best-selling author, peace activist, and prominent voice for the Muscular Dystrophy Association fervently believed in and promoted world peace not just as a concept, but as a reality.Mattie was working on this manuscript with Jimmy Carter when he died in June 2004. His mother, Jeni, who edited the material and wrote a preface for the book has published it at her son's request. Just Peace explores Mattie's concept of the world and all people as a unique mosaic of gifts. War and injustice shatter the mosaic, which can only be made whole again by planning and actively pursuing peace. The young visionary's essays, poetry, and photographs appear throughout the book. Jimmy Carter has written a special foreword for the book.Just as important to the book and enlightening to the reader are Mattie's many correspondences. Central to these are his personal e-mails to and from former president Jimmy Carter, Mattie's peace \"hero\" and role model. The Nobel Peace Prize winner met Mattie, considered him an angel, messenger, and hero in his own right, and was genuinely affected by Mattie's passion and drive. Just Peace is an intimate portrait of a president, a young man of hope, and peace itself.",

        "Description": "Almost everyone can \u201csee\u201d in the conventional sense, but developing photographic vision takes practice. Learning to See Creatively helps photographers visualize their work, and the world, in a whole new light. Now totally rewritten, revised, and expanded, this best-selling guide takes a radical approach to creativity. It explains how it is not some gift only for the \u201cchosen few\u201d but actually a skill that can be learned and applied. Using inventive photos from his own stunning portfolio, author and veteran photographer Bryan Peterson deconstructs creativity for photographers. He details the basic techniques that went into not only taking a particular photo, but also provides insights on how to improve upon it\u2014helping readers avoid the visual pitfalls and technical dead ends that can lead to dull, uninventive photographs. This revised edition features the latest information on digital photography and digital imaging software, as well as an all-new section on color as a design element. Learning to See Creatively is the definitive reference for any photographers looking for a fresh perspective on their work.",

        "Description": "Tai-Jung Um, born in 1938 in Moon-Kyung, is one of Korea's most renowned sculptors. In the sixties he discovered the artistic potential of iron and steel. Like Anthony Caro, Eduardo Chillida, and David Smith, Tai-Jung Un consciously seeks to embrace materials that are used in industrial production. Initially, he utilized these materials to demonstrate how closed units aspired to move outward, breaking and bursting open, but as of the seventies he started to concentrate on the repetition of elementary shapes and forms. In a series of works that oscillate between floor reliefs and sculptures spanning space, he experiments with the possibilities of the rectangle and explores the relationship of colour and spatial bodies. And in the eighties he arrived at the material that was to become his \"own\", namely copper. Copper's colour tonalities, gleam, and essential properties henceforth fascinated him. He devised a special welding technique in order to be able to join cooper sheet with brass elements, and swiftly emerged as a master of surface design. The year 2000 marked the beginning of a new era for Tai-Jung Um, too. He abandoned the semantics of materials such as copper, brass, and bronze, and turned his attention to aluminum instead. Like Donald Judd, he appreciates the neutrality of aluminum's smooth reflective surface, and likewise limits himself to the repertoire of basic geometrical shapes.",

Brite, Julie Smith, John Biguenet, Nancy Lemann, and Valerie Martin, among others. The characters in these works find themselves everywhere from Sarajevo on the eve of the First World War to Algiers Point just across the Mississippi River, but their stories are all anchored in the French Quarter. They wander from the 18th-century New World to a rooftop view of Bourbon Street on the cusp of the third millennium. Interspersed with the history of the city, these stories penetrate the standard clichTs and reflect the true sense of the French Quarter\u00f9its sensuality, mystery, the life behind its walls\u00f9and lift the veils of privacy altogether. Whether surrealism or satire, these exceptional stories are beautiful, poignant, tragic, and comic.\"",
