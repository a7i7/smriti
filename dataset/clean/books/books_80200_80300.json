But between 1978 and 1979, acclaimed New Yorker short story writer Julie Hecht attempted to arrange an interview with him, hoping to discover how he came to do what he did.  The one-hour interview turned into innumerable surreal meetings and phone conversations with her subject; but she couldn't always tell when his act was on. Whether driving recklessly on icy roads, or drawing the author unaware into his schemes and dada-esque pranks on unsuspecting waiters and college students, Andy Kaufman never seemed to separate himself from his stage personality--or personalities. Was This Man a Genius? is the culmination of a series of bizarre, frequently hilarious meetings; In describing them Hecht, herself a master of wit and observation,  illuminates the enigma of Andy Kaufman's work and life.",

        "Authors": "By Wiehe, Philip",
        "Description": "Ten Dumb Things Churches Do is about making the system we call the local church into one that truly reflects what we believe the body of Christ is supposed to be--a community that exemplifies the gospel through its life together and its presence in the world. Knowing when we\u2019ve done that, however, is difficult to measure. A business makes money, the Red Cross provides emergency relief, and a symphony orchestra makes beautiful music. But what exactly is the church supposed to do and how should it do that? Based on his years as an Episcopal priest and church consultant, Philip Wiehe writes here about the church as it is today and how we will need to retrofit it to fulfill its mission in the years to come. Along the way he exposes ten dumb things\u2014traps that churches often fall into, including: being too business-like or not business-like enough; failing to do strategic planning; falling into the mission statement trap; making decisions poorly; internal turf wars; being confused about identity; and others. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Wiehe provides clergy and lay leaders of congregations with specific steps for undoing the messes they find themselves in, or even avoiding them altogether.",

From the courtroom to the halls of Congress, these female trailblazers have battled tremendous odds to achieve success\u2014if not always recognition\u2014in their respective fields. Senator Hutchison, a trailblazer herself, became the first woman from the state of Texas elected to the United States Senate.Following in the footsteps of her bestselling book American Heroines, Senator Hutchison continues to celebrate female accomplishment in all walks of life. Whether committed to a chosen cause or thrust into a public role by personal circumstance, the women profiled in Leading Ladies have all woven thin threads of opportunity into sweeping tapestries of achievement. Without their spirit and perseverance, many of the obstacles they so daringly conquered might still remain in place today. Gerti Cori's Nobel Prize victory in 1947 enabled other female scientists like Rita Levi-Montalcini to pursue their own research interests. Pearl Buck's bestselling novels made it possible for authors like Amy Tan to expand the boundaries of the American literary canon even further. Susan B. Anthony's indefatigable efforts to win women the right to vote allowed Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congresswoman Mary Bono, and Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao to eventually rise to some of the highest offices in the nation.Mixing historical portraits with modern success stories, Senator Hutchison shows how American women from all periods of history have contributed to the strength and progress of our nation. With courage, purpose, and compassion, the women of Leading Ladies continue to blaze trails for thousands of American women to follow\u2014and no history of the nation can be written without them.",

Myths about how to be spiritual abound, and most of us have bought into at least a few of them, even if we're not aware of it. Tami Coyne and Karen Weissman help strip away the woowoo, the nono's, and the silly rules. With an outrageous and edgy look at the challenges they face in their own lives, the Spiritual Chicks share a no-holds-barred quest to know, feel, and apply universal goodness and authenticity to life.In short lessons, posed as questions and juxtaposed against relevant passages from a surprising range of sources  The Terminator, the Bible, Yogi Berra, the Peace Pilgrim, Clarence Darrow, Mahatma Gandhi  pop culture, sacred scriptures from a variety of traditions, thinkers from around the world and throughout history the Spiritual Chicks take on topics like: Will God love me if I'm too fat? Do I need to suffer? How would I act if I were happy? Does electricity prove the existence of God? Is life a maximum security prison? Is there sex after death?The Chicks pose the questions, throw out some ideas and stories, and invite us all to answer. They make learning to live honestly, and with conviction, fun, easy, and doable. After all, \"The only qualification you need to become a spiritual person is the wherewithal to recognize that you already are one.\"",

        "Authors": "By Plaidy, Jean",
        "Description": "In the court of Henry VIII, no woman is beyond the King\u2019s notice, and no queen is beyond his wrath. In the span of just seven years, Queen Catherine of Aragon is discarded in boredom; Queen Anne Boleyn is beheaded on trumped-up charges of infidelity; Queen Jane Seymour has the good fortune to die from childbirth just as the King begins to lose interest in her; and Queen Anne of Cleves is rejected for being ugly. It\u2019s beginning to seem that the sovereign is incorrigible in matters of the heart. But when a self-proclaimed charming bimbo with no wealth, no gift for conversation, and no head for the intricacies of politics strikes the King\u2019s fancy, her family will do backflips to grease the works toward a fifth royal wedding, despite the King\u2019s track record. With a pretty singing voice and a penchant for giggling, Katherine Howard unwittingly woos the most powerful man in England, and suddenly finds herself in a position both glamorous and deadly. For Katherine\u2019s past is speckled with improprieties, and the court is full of schemers who could ruin her with a whispered secret. In The Rose Without a Thorn , Jean Plaidy, the grande dame of historical fiction, weaves a spellbinding story of how a king\u2019s affection for a young girl turns from a fairy-tale-come-true, to a bitter chokehold that will kill her. In Katherine Howard\u2019s fresh, unforgettable voice, The Rose Without a Thorn explores the frantic posturing and jostling for power that defines sixteenth century life in the English court and the subtle series of events that leads to Katherine\u2019s demise. Her fall from na\u00ef vet\u00e9 is sudden and shocking. After a childhood of poverty and blissful ignorance in a ramshackle house full of children, her transformation to lady-in-waiting\u2014and her subsequent initiation into the carefree joys of sex\u2014seems effortless and entertaining. Katherine is suited for love, and moves easily from one passionate paramour to the next, with no inkling that her actions could threaten her reputation. But when a chance encounter endears her to King Henry VIII, it becomes clear that her destiny is not her own. Between the brash politicking of her ruthless uncle and the magnetism of her own gentle personality, Katherine is caught in an inescapable relationship with His Majesty that will force her to forsake the one man she truly loves. She must play a role, and play it well, or she and her entire family will face destruction. But Katherine\u2019s past catches up with her before she learns the rules of the game, and no amount of love or loyalty will conjure the mercy she needs to stay alive. In elegant, spare prose, Jean Plaidy takes a fascinating look at one woman\u2019s brief but dazzling",

But ever since the birth of her children, she's had a fantasy about locking herself in her bedroom for twenty-four hours with a good book and a box of chocolates.  Unfortunately, her husband James doesn't understand her feelings. And when Lizzie unburdens herself in a flaming email to her sister Janie, then hits send at the wrong moment and accidentally shoots it off to James instead, her fairytale life gets a big dose of reality. With the word \"divorce\" ringing in her ears, Lizzie finds herself moving out and embarking on a totally different life - working hard to reinvent herself as a runner, a gardener, and a writer of children's books.  But despite transforming her body, her neglected career, and her libido (courtesy of the local landscape gardener), Lizzie can't get over her soon-to-be ex. As Lizzie discovers, sometimes the fairytale ending is just the beginning of the real story.",

He fights intimations of annihilation in still-Communist Czechoslovakia, while promiscuously consorting with dissidents, apparatchiks, and Midwestern Republicans. Next, he succumbs to the temptations of power by accepting the presidency of a quaint and cosseted honorary body patterned on the Academie Francaise. Then, the reader finds him on trial in California and on a criminal rampage in a gothic Gotham, abetted by a nubile sidekick called Robin. Lastly, our septuagenarian veteran of the literary wars is rewarded with a coveted medal, stunning him into a well-deserved silence.",

The bodies of a young man and a beautiful noblewoman, bound together, are dragged from the murky Sumida River: a typical shinju, a ritual double suicide committed by a pair of star-crossed lovers.But when Sano, a tutor, a samurai, and now a reluctant police officer, begins a routine investigation, he comes to suspect murder. And as he unravels the twisted story behind these deaths, he stumbles upon a trail of deceit and assassination that threatens the very underpinnings of the shogun's Japan.Shinju is a suspenseful page-turning journey through the seductive world of medieval Japanese culture, politics, and sex. Filled with exceptional detail and color reminiscent of James Clavell, informed by the sort of investigatory suspense that inspired Gorky Park, Shinju merges breathtaking historical fiction with a first-rate detective tale. With this novel, Laura Joh Rowland emerges as a major talent, a powerful writer and entertaining storyteller of the first rank.",

In the early 1990s in New York, easy money stands to be made at every turn, and temptation proves a bitter struggle for the young and much-decorated NYPD Sergeant Steven Holt---and for Steven and his uncle Robert, an officer before him, an increasingly violent mess endangers their careers and the reputation of the entire department.Born out of real stories of corruption and centered around two men who ultimately dare to challenge the fabled \u201cblue wall\u201d of silence, the novel works toward a majestic courtroom on Long Island, where Sergeant Holt is about to stand trial for triple homicide and where, as he comes to know his past, he\u2019ll learn that nothing he\u2019s known has ever been as it seemed.In its intense telling by one of the only writers who could write it with such realism, the story uncovers decades of deceit and corruption that infiltrate families and threaten to ruin the force. Reflecting the proud yet troubled history of the NYPD, Charles Hynes\u2019s debut is a searing, up-close portrait of the men and women who live---and die---in the pursuit of criminal justice.",

Laura is hired to provide security, but somewhere between the dancing and the fireworks, a student disappears.Katie Arkwright wore white.

        "Authors": "By Waterman, Robert H., Jr.",
        "Description": "True or false? \"America is falling behind in world competition.\" The surprise answer is \"false.\" Recent research on industrialized nations shows that American workers outproduce workers in Germany and France by 20 percent, workers in Britain by over 30 percent, and Japanese workers by over 60 percent. The reason has nothing to do with technology, worker attitude, or worker skill.In this incisive, anecdotal book Robert H. Waterman, Jr., looks at some of the best American firms and concludes that the key to strategic advantage is organization: they are organized to focus on the things that motivate their own people, and organized to anticipate customer needs.Waterman's crisp case studies give us an insider's view of why these firms are so good. For example, we'll see how Procter & Gamble gets a productivity advantage of 30-40 percent through a work force that's essentially self-managing. (Procter & Gamble developed this system over thirty years ago and considered it so strategic that they wouldn't talk about it until now.) We'll see how a set of strongly held, shared values - not strategy - built the AES Corporation from a start-up eleven years ago to a company whose market value today is close to $1.7 billion.Waterman also gives us an in-depth look at how companies such as Merck and Rubbermaid maintain a strategic edge through raw innovation. In 1993 Rubbermaid invented 365 new products, one for every day of the year. How did they manage it?Waterman's argument is firmly grounded in specific details and in firsthand observation. But his message about American competitiveness transcends any particular case history or industry. All of us can learn from the example of these firms that in one way or another strike out into new frontiers of excellence.",

Among the controversial subjects addressed are the moral status of animals, environmental account-ablility, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, and the ultimate choice of living an ethical life. This book provides an unsurpassed one-volume view of both the underpinnings and the applications of Singer's governing philosophy.",

Step-by-step, readers follow Jenny's long journey through a \"wasteland\" of failed treatments and therapies, false hope, and abuse by the mental health system that kept her captive most of her life.  Although this disease has been at the forefront of public awareness for years, anorexia continues to claim more victims than any other mental illness. Slim to None reveals the glaring inadequacy of the mental health system to treat and fully understand this disease.  The first journal of an anorexic to be published posthumously, the book discloses the innermost thoughts, fears, and hopes of a young girl stricken and fighting to recover.  Jenny Hendricks painstakingly recorded her experiences as she suffered from and eventually succumbed to this eating disorder. With candor, she recounts being shipped from one doctor to another and subjected to widely varying treatments--all of which ultimately proved unsuccessful. Her father, Gordon Hendricks, fills in this compelling narrative with his own memories of his daughter's struggle.",
