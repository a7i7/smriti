He poured his own youthful experience of Victorian London's unspeakable squalor into this realistic depiction of the link between destitution and crime. Oliver escapes his miserable servitude by running away to London, where he unwillingly but inevitably joins a scabrous gang of thieves. Masterminded by the loathsome Fagin, the underworld crew features some of Dickens' most memorable characters, including the juvenile pickpocket known as the Artful Dodger, the vicious Bill Sikes, and gentle Nancy, an angel of self-sacrifice.A profound social critic, Dickens introduced genteel readers to the problems of the poor in a way that had rarely been attempted before. This tale of the struggle between hope and cruelty continues to speak to modern audiences.",

No safety now. For Olivia, not even the distractions of school and friends could ease the crushing feeling that she was now unnecessary. Perhaps a daughter who needed an appointment to see her own father wasn't worth seeing at all. And then Nick moved in with her mother, and Olivia had to surrender even the sanctuary of her own home. Always now, she could feel him watching her, his eyes wandering over her body. Often now, she crossed her arms self-consciously to cover her breasts.Nick was everything Olivia's father was not; he was blond and broad-shouldered, he smoked, he filled the house with growling jazz. And although she avoided him, he was persistent - offering a lift in his Jaguar, arranging a special dinner. Before long, Olivia was confiding in this stranger, the only adult who seemed to have the time or the desire to listen to her. Then one day, his hand lingered a moment too long on her shoulder, and Olivia could feel its warmth.",

In this wonderfully readable account, Fraser Smith explores the formative influences, backroom deals, personal relationships, quirky Baltimorisms, vicious fights, civic pride, splashes in the National Aquarium seal pool, victories, defeats, draws\u2014everything that makes Schaefer's career colorful and that helps us to understand the man himself.A seasoned reporter who covered Schaefer's terms as mayor and governor for the Baltimore Sun, Smith takes a serious-minded but also throughly human-interest approach to his subject\u2014a study in character and the capacity of certain people to make a difference in the story of their time and locale. In Schaefer's case, the story concerns the struggle of Baltimore to survive and, if possible, renew itself. Smith draws on a sizable body of documentary source material; his scores of interviews provide him with juicy quotation and vibrant commentary. The book includes a gallery of photos, most never before published, which recall memorable moments in Schaefer's eventful career.William Donald Schaefer: A Political Biography will fascinate Maryland voters, appeal to students of twentieth-century America, and engage anyone who loves a good story well told.\"His life in politics had been vouchsafed by do gooders, club house operators, slick businessmen, and others. He managed to find the best in each of these without being a servant to any. He was a classic 1950s-style Can-Do man, a veteran of the Second World War, a holdover from the time in American life when learning from experience and respected elders was a way of life. He was a career politician who ran for office to serve\u2014to work for people, to care about their welfare. He wanted to think of himself\u2014and to have others think of him\u2014as a distinguished city father, a public servant. He seemed to be the last Baltimorean to see how well he had succeeded.\"\u2014from the Preface",

        "Description": "Innovative and on the cutting edge, Visionary Selling shows you how to sell effectively to top decision makers by going beyond the hard sell of a specific product to aligning with the broader vision of top management.

By discovering customers' vision and formulating innovative ideas to enhance their businesses, salespeople can \"cross the boundary\" of sales to perform as business allies in a collaboration to fulfill the vision of their customers.

        "Title": "A Practical Guide for Business Speaking",
        "Authors": "By Bailey, Edward P.",
        "Description": "Whether you are an corporate executive or an entrepreneur, a military officer or an engineer, the ability to speak well in public is vital. Perhaps you are a medical researcher demonstrating a new surgical technique at a seminar. Or a sales manager outlining a new commission plan to your national sales force. Or the head of a small business trying to land a big account. It is essential that you deliver an effective presentation.In A Practical Guide for Business Speaking, consultant and educator Edward Bailey offers a thorough, down-to-earth, easy-to-use handbook that contains everything you need to give the best presentations possible. Bailey offers a gold mine of detailed advice as he takes you through the process a step at a time. He stresses that most presentations succeed or fail in the design stage. He then shows how to design your speech for maximum impact--using a \"blueprint\" and clear transitions to keep the audience focused--and how to use examples to avoid one of the worst pitfalls of public speaking, abstraction. He describes the many kinds of visual aids available, from overhead transparencies, to flip charts, to blackboards and whiteboards, and he discusses the pluses and minuses of each. He tells you what to look for when checking out a room in advance--for instance, see if the projector focuses well, if the room is cool enough to prevent drowsiness, if the microphone works, and so on. (Bailey provides a nineteen-point checklist for setting up the room in an appendix.) In addition, he offers solid advice on how to rehearse before a talk, how to break the ice with the audience, how to design your own visual aids, and how to handle question-and-answer periods.Perhaps what is most impressive is the wealth of detailed advice presented here. For instance, when using a pointer, hold it in the hand closer to the screen (with the far hand, you turn your back on the audience, making it harder to hear you). When designing a visual aid, use at least 18 point type, and seldom use all capital letters (sentences of capital letters are harder to read). And when reading from a text, don't staple the pages--constant page-turning distracts the audience. Instead, keep the pages loose, and slide each page to one side as you finish it.Based on years of experience, A Practical Guide for Business Speaking is a must for anyone who speaks in public. You can read it in an afternoon, but it will improve your presentations forever.",

There, among the archives inherited from his great-aunt Rebecca MacKenzie, was a 1920s journal recounting the thrilling and dangerous adventures of fifteen-year-old Rebecca and her younger brother, Doug, in the wake of their parents' mysterious disappearance in the deserts of China. Now carefully re-created in a lavish volume \u2014 complete with cloth binding and a journal-style elastic clasp \u2014 the siblings' tale begins aboard the Expedient, their uncle's enigmatic research ship, and moves at a breathless pace through the streets of Shanghai and on to a terrifying island fortress. Along the way, Doug and Becca encounter an ancient order of Chinese mercenaries, a brutal pirate warlord, a feisty Texan heiress, and a stolen cache of a volatile explosive called zoridium. By their saga's end, the intrepid duo has exposed a murderous plot involving their parents and uncovered a high-minded secret society hidden from the world for hundreds of years. Interspersed are such \"archival\" elements as: \u2014 elaborate diagrams and maps \u2014 vintage photos and illustrations \u2014 documents with stamps, seals, and watermarks \u2014 four full-color gatefolds, the largest a six-page foldout \u2014 extensive appendices and notes Painstakingly researched and packed with authentic detail, OPERATION RED JERICHO is the first of three nonstop-action tales of intrigue by first-time author Joshua Mowll \u2014 historical fiction at its finest.",

Only after he dares to open a forbidden door does he learn the hideous nature of their experiments \u2014 and his own chilling role in them. Set against the disquiet of Revolutionary Boston, M. T.

And I hate the message that women can't possibly be happy until we all fit into our skinny jeans. I don't find these stories uplifting; they make me want to hug these women and take them out for fizzy champagne drinks and cheesecake and explain to them that until they figure out their insides, their outsides don't matter. Unfortunately, being overweight isn't simply a societal issue that can be fixed with a dose healthy of positive self-esteem. It\u2019s a health matter, and here on the eve of my fortieth year, I've learned I have to make changes so I don't, you know, die.

And few are more annoying than Microsoft Windows 98. Perhaps you're annoyed with the icons that Windows deposits on your desktop and that you never use.

Given the book's format, which presents particular problems and immediately offers one or more solutions, you can quickly identify the Windows 98 features that most annoy you and equally quickly provide a fix for them. In the process, you'll take charge of Windows so that it works the way you want, rather than the way that Microsoft or some other software publisher has configured it.Based on the author's extremely popular Windows Annoyances web site www.annoyances.org, Windows 98 Annoyances provides an authoritative collection of techniques for customizing Windows 98, including:Useful keyboard shortcuts that let you work with Windows 98 more efficientlyTechniques for working with the Windows registry, the database of system and application-specific configuration informationAvailable third-party software and utilities that handle some of the more complex workarounds and customizationsDealing with software applications that overwrite your file associations without warningA discussion of scripting with the Windows Scripting Host as a means of eliminating many of the Windows 98's annoyances to be the definitive resource for customizing Windows 98.",
