        "Title": "Japan's New Global Role",
        "Authors": "By Lincoln, Edward J.",
        "Description": "Since 1980, Japan's international economic position has undergone a historic transformation that is now having significant consequences for Japan, the United States, Europe, and other countries around the world. In this book, Edward J. Lincoln analyzes the major economic changes that occurred in Japan during the 1980s, including macroeconomic shifts, financial deregulation, yen appreciation, rising labor costs brought on by long-term demographic changes, and technological success.Since 1945, the Japanese have shied away from active involvement in most of the complications and problems of the international community. Now, however, a surge in outward foreign investment, particularly direct investment, has involved the nation, more intimately with the outside world than in the past. As a result, Japan has had to cope with some difficult new questions: how to participate meaningfully in the work of the major multilateral economic institutions and the United Nations, how to expand or change the country's foreign aid program, how to take part in the intentional debate on environmental policy, and how deeply to  become involved in solving the world's political problems.Lincoln asserts that overcoming the string of insularity and passivism for the years since 1945 will not be easy. He proposes several specific policies that would lead Japan toward a more productive international engagement and suggests that these changes will also serve the objectives of American foreign policy.The 1993 elections and the new coalition government in Japan offer a greater possibility of domestic change; the mood of the nation has shifted away from continued acceptance of the policies of the past. There is now a greater opportunity for the American government to engage in a productive dialogue that can encourage Japan toward a more open and active global role.",

        "Title": "IBM Redux: Lou Gerstner and the Business Turnaround of the Decade",
        "Authors": "By Garr, Doug",
        "Description": "Can one man change the course of business history? When Lou Gerstner, a high-tech neophyte, took the helm at IBM in 1993, the company was in a death spiral. Big Blue lost $8 billion that year, capping a three-year loss of nearly $16 billion. One of the nation's premiere industrial giants seemed destined to wither away and die in bankruptcy. The world of high technology changed and IBM failed to adapt, drowning in its own bureaucracy and its insular view of the business world.Six years later, after a miraculous recovery, IBM is vital and thriving once again. The stock has reached its all-time high, the balance sheet is cashrich, and its market capitalization has increased more than fourfold to $169 billion. It is a success story beyond compare. IBM Redux is the inside story of the greatest turnaround in business history, and the man who made it happenHere is the first in-depth look at IBM's recovery and the man who is leading it, Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. It is a skillfully told story, as author Doug Garr chronicles Gerstner's rise, his arrival as the first steward from outside the company's ranks, and his implementation of new business and marketing strategies. Drawn from more than 150 interviews and hundreds of pages of documents, Garr paints an enthralling portrait of the improbable transformation of this dying mainframe company into an increasingly nimble information services giant. With unprecedented access to current and former IBM employees, the author provides rare insight into how it happened and what still needs to happen for the company to thrive in the twenty-first century. From the complete overhaul of IBM's culture and image to the takeover of Lotus and the development of network technology, Garr vividly illustrates Gerstner's operating methods, management philosophy, and, yes, vision. And along the way he reveals who this extraordinary, sometimes difficult, man is, what drives him, and where, in the eyes of his critics, he has missed the mark. Fast-paced and fascinating, IBM Redux is the first unauthorized, behind-the-scenes look at a remarkable company and its remarkable manager who, after previous careers dispensing cookies and credit cards, is rapidly changing the face of the entire high-tech industry.",

In this volume, Adams explains how personalities and events of the period shaped American national development. Adams's historical masterpiece (most specifically the first six chapters) so fittingly presents what America is all about. It not only explains what Adams and others in his time described as the revolution of 1800, but it also offers a key to two other national revolutions that were to come, those of 1860 and 1991.By exploring the origins of American democracy, we can learn what Adams knew in the 1880s-that a pride in democracy and a willingness to make it prevail were all that people needed to free them from the chains of the past and perils in the future.",

In January 1998, in the dead of an Alaskan winter, a cataclysmic Arctic storm with hurricane-force winds and towering seas forced five fishermen to abandon their vessel in the Gulf of Alaska and left them adrift in thirty-eight-degree water with no lifeboat. Their would-be rescuers were 150 miles away at the Coast Guard station, with the nearby airport shut down by an avalanche.The Last Run is the epic tale of the wreck of the oldest registered fishing schooner in Alaska, a hellish Arctic tempest, and the three teams of aviators in helicopters who withstood 140-mph gusts and hovered alongside waves that were ten stories high. But what makes this more than a true-life page-turner is its portrait of untamed Alaska and the unflappable spirit of people who forge a different kind of life on America's last frontier, the \"end of the roaders\" who are drawn to, or flee to, Alaska to seek a final destiny.",

        "Description": "Peter Edelman has worked as an aide to Robert F. Kennedy, a lawyer, a children's advocate, and a policymaker. He has devoted his life to the cause of justice and to ending inequality. But in 1996, while serving in the Clinton administration as an expert on welfare policy and children, he found himself in an untenable position. The president signed a new welfare bill that ended a sixty-year federal commitment to poor children, and as justification invoked the words of RFK. For Edelman, Clinton's twisting of Kennedy's vision was deeply cynical, so in a rare gesture that sparked front-page coverage in the New York Times and the Washington Post, he resigned from the administration. The nation, he believed, had been harmed.Drawing on Edelman's vast personal experience with the issues and many of the key figures, SEARCHING FOR AMERICA'S HEART shows that in an age of unprecedented prosperity, Americans have in many respects forsaken their fellow citizens. While we daily break economic records, we have largely given up our vision of social and economic justice, leaving behind a devastatingly large number of poor and near-poor, many of them children. Edelman shines a bright light on these forgotten Americans. Also, based in part on a firsthand look at community efforts across the country, he proposes a bold and practical program for addressing the difficult issues of entrenched poverty. Edelman focuses on novel ways of braiding together national and local civic activism, reinvigorating our commitment to children, and building hope in our most shattered communities.Surveying the American landscape at the beginning a new presidency and a new Congress, SEARCHING FOR AMERICA'S HEART lays the foundation for a newly conceived politics, a vision true to the legacy of Robert F. Kennedy.",

        "Description": "Visitors to the Pennsylvania Dutch country in Pennsylvania are usually delighted with the unique food tradition that survives there among the hills and small, well-tended farms. Ultimately based on the rich cookery of the peasants and small townspeople of the Rhineland and Switzerland, \"Dutch\" cookery has expanded into the new foodstuffs and materials that America has to offer, and it is one of the gastronomic treats of the country. Dishes such as apple soup, baked bananas, Dutch liver dumplings, spaetzle and braten, walnut shad, and oyster peppers are enjoyed by almost everyone.One of the difficulties about Dutch cookery, however, is that is always has been a home cooking style within a closely knit community, and it does not go by cookbooks. Until this book appeared, the best that one could do was to try to cadge an occasional recipe from a Dutch acquaintance or a local inn.Mr. George Frederick, one-time president of the Gourmet Society of New York, was in an unmatched position to record the delights of Dutch cookery. Himself a native Pennsylvania Dutchman, with access to countless kitchens and family cooking secrets, he was also a gourmet of international stature. He has gathered together 358 recipes that show the Dutch tradition at its strongest, all dishes with the unique savor that distinguishes them from their occasional counterparts in other cooking systems. His book is so good that it in turn has been taken over by many Pennsylvania resorts as the official cookbook.To list only a few of the mouthwatering recipes that Mr. Frederick gives in clear, accurate recipes that you can prepare: Dutch spiced cucumbers, raspberry sago soup, pretzel soup, squab with dumplings Nazareth, shrimp wiggle, Dutch beer eel, sherry sauerkraut, cheese custard, currant cakes, and many fine dumplings, pancakes, and soups . All types of food are covered.",

But this year the wind of unwelcome change is blowing. Suits, paperwork, and information technology are beginning to overshadow St. Oswald's tradition, and Straitley is finally, and reluctantly, contemplating retirement. He is joined this term by five new faculty members, including one who -- unbeknownst to Straitley and everyone else -- holds intimate and dangerous knowledge of St. Oswald's ways and secrets. Harboring dark ties to the school's past, this young teacher has arrived with one terrible goal: to destroy St. Oswald's.As the new term gets under way, a number of incidents befall students and faculty alike. Beginning as small annoyances -- a lost pen, a misplaced coffee mug -- they are initially overlooked. But as the incidents escalate in both number and consequence, it soon becomes apparent that a darker undercurrent is stirring within the school. With St. Oswald's unraveling, only Straitley stands in the way of its ruin. The veteran teacher faces a formidable opponent, however -- a master player with a bitter grudge and a strategy that has been meticulously planned to the final move, a secret game with very real, very deadly consequences.A harrowing tale of cat and mouse, this riveting, hypnotically atmospheric novel showcases New York Times bestselling author Joanne Harris's astonishing storytelling talent as never before.",

        "Description": "\"My heart always sinks within me when I hear the good housewife, of every class, say, 'I assure you the bed has been well slept in,' and I can only hope it is not true. What? Is the bed already saturated with somebody else's damp before my patient comes to exhale in it his own damp? Has it not had a single chance to be aired? No, not one. It has been slept in every night.\"From the best known work of Florence Nightingale (1820\u20131910), the originator and founder of modern nursing, comes a collection of notes that played an important part in the much needed revolution in the field of nursing. For the first time it was brought to the attention of those caring for the sick that their responsibilities covered not only the administration of medicines and the application of poultices, but the proper use of fresh air, light, warmth, cleanliness, quiet, and the proper selection and administration of diet. Miss Nightingale is outspoken on these subjects as well as on other factors that she considers essential to good nursing. But, whatever her topic, her main concern and attention is always on the patient and his needs.One is impressed with the fact that the fundamental needs of the sick as observed by Miss Nightingale are amazingly similar today (even though they are generally taken for granted now) to what they were over 100 years ago when this book was written. For this reason, this little volume is as practical as it is interesting and entertaining. It will be an inspiration to the student nurse, refreshing and stimulating to the experienced nurse, and immensely helpful to anyone caring for the sick.",

        "Description": "For the past four decades, the United Nations has played a significant peacekeeping role based on the consent of the warring parties in Cyprus, the Golan Heights, the Congo, and other flashpoints of conflict. But the UN role in maintaining world order has been redefined and broadened in recent years to embrace peace-enforcement efforts with or without the consent of the antagonists, often in combination with traditional peacekeeping.This dramatic change has provoked growing controversy both in the United States, hitherto the largest financial supporter of UN peacekeeping, and in Japan, where advocates of a larger Japanese global role are promoting expanded Japanese participation in UN peacekeeping missions.UN Peacekeeping: Japanese and American Perspectives is the product of a research project co-sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington and the Research Institute for Peace and Security in Tokyo. Eight American and Japanese specialists present contrasting perspectives on such issues as the criteria that should govern UN intervention in future conflicts; the desirability and feasibility of combining peacekeeping and peace enforcement; the limitations imposed by international law on UN intervention; the record of UN intervention in key arenas of conflict, including Cambodia, where Japan has played a major role; domestic attitudes toward UN peacekeeping in both countries; and the potential for Japanese-American cooperation in UN peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peace enforcement.",

        "Title": "The Portable Plato (Portable Library)",
        "Authors": "By Plato and Buchanan, Scott (EDT)",
        "Description": "Writing in the fourth century B.C., in an Athens that had suffered a humiliating defeat in the Peloponnesian War, Plato formulated questions that have haunted the moral, religious, and political imagination of the West for more than 2,000 years: what is virtue? How should we love? What constitutes a good society? Is there a soul that outlasts the body and a truth that transcends appearance? What do we know and how do we know it? Plato's inquiries were all the more resonant because he couched them in the form of dramatic and often highly comic dialogues, whose principal personage was the ironic, teasing, and relentlessly searching philosopher Socrates.In this splendid collection, Scott Buchanan brings together the most important of Plato's dialogues, including Protagoras, The Symposium, with its barbed conjectures about the relation between love and madness, Phaedo and The Republic, his monumental work of political philosophy. Buchanan's learned and engaging introduction allows us to see Plato both as a commentator on his society and as a shaper of the societies that followed, who bequeathed to us a hunger for the ideal as well as a redeeming habit of humane skepticism.",

        "Authors": "By Borosage, Robert L. (EDT) and Hickey, Roger (EDT)",
        "Description": "In The Next Agenda, editors Robert Borosage and Roger Hickey of the Campaign for America's Future have gathered essays written by some of America's most progressive thinkers and activists that lay out ideas and reforms to address the serious issues facing us today. They argue that the economic prosperity of the last decade can only be sustained if it is more widely shared. And they call for a new progressive movement to forge new rules for the global economy just as the Progressives of the last century tamed the excesses of America's national economy.Each of the fourteen essays in The Next Agenda detail the context that makes fundamental reform both necessary and possible and outlines the policy proposals that are vital to begin meeting the challenge. David Moberg, reporter for In These Times, writes about reforming labor law to empower workers whose voices have been drowned out by globalization. Richard Rothstein, education columnist for the New York Times, writes of the growing shortage of classrooms and teachers and suggests reform initiatives for public education. Ted Marmor of the Yale School of Management, and Jon Oberlander, of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, provide a plan to make affordable, comprehensive health care available to everyone. Carl Pope of The Sierra Club and a leader of the environmental movement joins with labor leader Robert Wages, of PACE International, to lay out elements of a Green Growth agenda, detailing how labor and environmentalists can combine in promoting sensible investments for sustainable growth. These forward-thinking essays serve as a springboard for national debate and provide an ambitious agenda for the next administration.",

        "Description": "Medal of Honor portrays 11 recipients of this sacred U.S. military decoration, from the Civil War through the Vietnam War, and examines what drove them to go so far above and beyond the call of duty. Among the stories is an account of the life of the only woman ever to receive the medal; of an officer who staged a daring escape from a German POW camp in WWI; and of a soldier from the legendary WWII Japanese-American 442nd, who went on to earn the medal in the Korean War. The book tells not only of astonishing military actions but also, significantly, of the recipients' lives before and after their wartime experiences.In his moving commentary, acclaimed 60 Minutes reporter Mike Wallace places these actions in historical context and relates his own personal experiences in WWII and as a journalist covering recent wars. He also meditates on the meaning of courage and shows what we can all learn from these extraordinary individuals.\"The President may award, and present in the name of Congress, a medal of honor of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to a person who, while a member of the Army, Navy, or Air Force distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.\" --The United States Congress",

        "Description": "Since the end of the Cold War, the US military has reduced its combat forces by 40 percent, closed about 20 percent of its bases, and withdrawn from many overseas posts. Even after these changes, the US military is by far the strongest in the world, with huge advantages in training, equipment, and technology. Despite cutting its annual spending by about 30 percent, the United States spends more than the countries with the six next-largest military budgets combined. Heated debates continue to rage over US military spending. In the late 1990s, many commentators claimed that spending was too low, and the defense budget began to increase for the first time since the mid-1980s. Others argued that the United States had taken on too many military missions\u2014including frequent humanitarian interventions or peacekeeping operations\u2014and needed to scale back these deployments. Holding the Line presents objective and detailed assessments of the US defense budget and America's military strategy. Its contributors conclude that the United States must reshape its military to face the real challenges of the coming decades. They call for smaller US forces with more modern weapons, sensors, avionics, and communications systems. They offer recommendations that would enable the US military to transform its forces and make them more effective, while holding the line on defense budget increases.",

Their son, Tick, leaves town with a traveling preacher and later makes a name for himself as an evangelist with the gift of tongues. Worthy believes his life is as bad as it can be until Drayton Hunt, the town troublemaker, steps forward claiming to be Cappy's natural father - a possibility that Worthy will never accept, but one that Cappy eventually has to deal with.",

Hundreds of questions and answers treat everything from eating and sleeping problems to day care, tantrums, bottle mouth, shyness, self-esteem, and more. An entire third section of the book is devoted to toilet training, safety, and health, and a fourth covers special concerns-the exceptional child, siblings, and balancing work and parenting.Remarkably thorough, caring and intelligent, What to Expect the Toddler Years is as valuable for the seasoned parent as it is for the new parent. 2.4 million copies in print.",
