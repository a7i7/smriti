        "Authors": "By Miles, Rosalind",
        "Description": "Last in a line of proud queens elected to rule the fertile lands of the West, true owner of the legendary Round Table, guardian of the Great Goddess herself . . . a woman whose story has never been told--until now.As High King and Queen, Arthur and Guenevere reign supreme across the many kingdoms of Great Britain. Still, Guenevere secretly mourns the loss of her beloved Lancelot, who has returned to the Sacred Lake of his boyhood, hoping to restore his faith in chivalry in the place where he learned to be a knight. In a glittering Pentecost ceremony, new knights are sworn to the Round Table, including Arthur's nephews, Agravain and Gawain. After many years of strife, peace is restored to Guenevere's realm. But betrayal, jealousy, and ancient blood feuds fester unseen. Morgan Le Fay, now the mother of Arthur's only son, Mordred, has become the focus of Merlin's age-old quest to ensure the survival of the house of Pendragon. From the east comes the shattering news that Guenevere may have a rival for Lancelot's love. A bleak shadow falls again across Camelot--and across the sacred isle of Avalon, where Roman priests threaten the life of the Lady herself. At the center of the storm is Guenevere, torn between her love for her husband, her people, and Sir Lancelot of the Lake.  With rare and intuitive magic, Rosalind Miles brings to life a legendary woman's bravery and passion, and all the pageantry, heartbreak, violence, and beauty of an age gone by.",

        "Title": "Londonstani",
        "Authors": "By Malkani, Gautam",
        "Description": "Jas is in trouble. Because of who he is-an eighteen-year-old Asian living in London. Because of the gang he hangs out with. And because of the woman he fancies, Samira, who Jas shouldn't have taken a shining to because she is, as his pals point out, not one of his own. He's in trouble because his education, never mind his career, is going nowhere. And he's fallen into the schemes, games and prejudices of his friends on the streets of the big western city in which he lives. But Jas's main trouble is Jas himself, and he doesn't even know the trouble he's in, and try as hard as he does, he's failing to make sense of what it is to be young, male and what you might say is Indostani in a city that professes to be a melting pot but is a city of racial and religious exclusion zones. Without his parents' aspirations to assimilate, without the gifts of his more academically accomplished contemporaries, Jas is a young man without a survival plan to get by in the big city. He's out of touch, an anachronism posing as young man who's up-to-date, living free-style, making things up as he goes along in suburbs of West London.  Gautam Malkani's extraordinary comic novel portrays the lives of young Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu men in the ethnically charged enclave of one of the biggest western cities, London. A world usually-but wrongly-portrayed as the breeding ground for Islamic militants is, in actuality, a world of money (sometimes), flash cars (usually), cell phones (all the time), rap music and MTV, as well as rivalries and feuds, and the small-time crooks who exploit them. In Malkani's hilarious depiction of multiculturalism, race is no more than a proxy for masculinity, or lack of masculinity, among young men struggling to get by in a remorseless city. Just as Martin Amis and Irving Welsh captured the mood and the ethos of the eighties and nighties, twenty-nine-year-old Gautam Malkani brilliantly evokes the life of immigrants who are not immigrants in Londonstani, bringing an entirely fresh perspective to contemporary fiction as he does so.",

No other childcare guide offers supportive, empathetic insights into the parents' own emotions, and no other guide includes both chronological chapters and alphabetical topics on all issues faced by families from conception through age six.\"Touchpoints\" are the universal spurts of development and the trying periods of regression that accompany them throughout childhood. Dr. Brazelton uses them as windows to help parents understand their child's behavior and prevent future problems. PART ONE: \"Touchpoints of Development\" is a vivid chronological account of the basic stages of early childhood. Every chapter covers: feeding; crying; temperament; social learning; stranger awareness; discipline; sleeping; learning; emotions; independence; self image; sexuality; communication; motor skills; attachment; play; self-esteem; toilet-training. PART TWO: \"Challenges to Development\" is a complete alphabetical reference.

Yet many of us still take our privacy for granted, even as we become more reliant than ever on telephones, computer networks, and electronic transactions of all kinds. Whitfield Diffie and Susan Landau argue that if we are to retain the privacy that characterized face-to-face relationships in the past, we must build the means of protecting that privacy into our communication systems.Diffie and Landau strip away the hype surrounding the policy debate to examine the national security, law enforcement, commercial, and civil liberties issues. They discuss the social function of privacy, how it underlies a democratic society, and what happens when it is lost.",

        "Authors": "By Dershowitz, Alan M.",
        "Description": "The greatest danger facing the world today, says Alan M. Dershowitz, comes from religiously inspired, state sponsored terrorist groups that seek to develop weapons of mass destruction for use against civilian targets. In his newest book, Dershowitz argues passionately and persuasively that global terrorism is a phenomenon largely of our own making and that we must and can take steps to reduce the frequency and severity of terrorist acts.Analyzing recent acts of terrorism and our reaction to them, Dershowitz explains that terrorism is successful when the international community gives in to the demands of terrorists?or even tries to understand and eliminate the ?root causes\u201d of terrorism. He discusses extreme approaches to wiping out international terrorism that would work if we were not constrained by legal, moral, and humanitarian considerations. And then, given that we do operate under such constraints, he offers a series of proposals that would effectively reduce the frequency and severity of international terrorism by striking a balance between security and liberty.",

        "Description": "With 79 million people, the German Federal Republic today is the most populous country in Europe, with awesome economic power and a dominant political position in the European community. Yet how well do we know this powerful nation? This highly readable and lucid exploration of Germany past and present seeks to illuminate the question of German identity through various lenses - social, historical, geographical, cultural, economical, and political. First and foremost is a penetrating analysis of the recent right-wing and neo-Nazi movement in Germany.Written after dozens of interviews with leading Germans for the acclaimed TV series The Germans, this book is fortified by the words of Germans from all backgrounds - from a Bundeswehr conscript to the president of the Bundesbank, from the head of Europe's largest industrial trust Mercedes/Daimler-Benz to the late chancellor Willy Brandt. For anyone who wants to know more about the new united Germany and who seeks an understanding of the role Germany will play in Europe of the future, this book is essential reading.",

Not content to just find a home and produce offspring in our internal space, parasites will drink our blood, eat our cells, and infest our muscles. There is very little that can be said in their favor, with perhaps one exception-- they are truly fascinating!Fearsome Fauna is a wickedly amusing and startlingly informative look into the secret world of these fascinating creatures. Perhaps the greatest biological success story of all time (there are more kinds of parasites than insects), parasites have found homes in the vast majority of people on earth and have learned to live in their environment without destroying it (usually). For readers who would like to meet these hardworking beasts-- or learn how to avoid them-- Fearsome Fauna tells you everything you always wanted to know about parasites but were too disgusted or terrified to ask.",

        "Title": "The Victors: Eisenhower and His Boys: The Men of World War II",
        "Authors": "By Ambrose, Stephen E.",
        "Description": "From America's preeminent military historian, Stephen E. Ambrose, comes a brilliant telling of the war in Europe, from D-Day, June 6, 1944, to the end, eleven months later, on May 7, 1945. This authoritative narrative account is drawn by the author himself from his five acclaimed books about that conflict, most particularly from the definitive and comprehensive D-Day and Citizen Soldiers, about which the great Civil War historian James McPherson wrote,  If there is a better book about the experience of GIs who fought in Europe during World War II, I have not read it. Citizen Soldiers captures the fear and exhilaration of combat, the hunger and cold and filth of the foxholes, the small intense world of the individual rifleman as well as the big picture of the European theater in a manner that grips the reader and will not let him go. No one who has not been there can understand what combat is like but Stephen Ambrose brings us closer to an understanding than any other historian has done.  The Victors also includes stories of individual battles, raids, acts of courage and suffering from Pegasus Bridge, an account of the first engagement of D-Day, when a detachment of British airborne troops stormed the German defense forces and paved the way for the Allied invasion; and from Band of Brothers, an account of an American rifle company from the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment who fought, died, and conquered, from Utah Beach through the Bulge and on to Hitter's Eagle's Nest in Germany.  Stephen Ambrose is also the author of Eisenhower, the greatest work on Dwight Eisenhower, and one of the editors of the Supreme Allied Commander's papers. He describes the momentous decisions about how and where the war was fought, and about the strategies and conduct of the generals and officers who led the invasion and the bloody drive across Europe to Berlin.  But it is, as always with Stephen Ambrose, the ranks, the ordinary boys and men, who command his attention and his awe. The Victors tells their stories, how citizens became soldiers in the best army in the world. Ambrose draws on thousands of interviews and oral histories from government and private archives, from the high command\u00e6 Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton -- on down through officers and enlisted men, to re-create the last year of the Second World War when the Allied soldiers pushed the Germans out of France, chased them across Germany, and destroyed the Nazi regime.",

        "Description": "Susan Eisenhower - writer, political analyst, public speaker, career woman - here looks back on the life of her grandmother in a tribute that coincides with the centenary of Mamie Eisenhower's birth. In this compelling biography of an army captain's wife who becomes First Lady, she paints the portrait of an independent, headstrong woman who was passionately engaged in a lifelong relationship with a man who was her utter opposite.Although Ms. Eisenhower writes with warm appreciation for her grandmother's life, she does not skirt controversy or bypass rumors. Based on a treasure trove of unpublished letters, Mrs. Ike breaks new historical ground and provides, for the first time, a rare insight into the personalities and interrelationship of two complex people.Set against the background of some of the century's greatest events, Mrs Ike is an American love story as well as a chronicle of \"a simpler, perhaps nobler time\" in American life - a period whose special tone has all but vanished from the contemporary scene. But the human qualities are enduring ones: Susan Eisenhower helps us to see Mamie as Ike did - a heroic and irresistible figure in her own right.",

Fritz, Keefer, and Nyhan's powerful critique of Bush's record of policy deception explains why the media has failed to hold him accountable and demonstrates the threat these tactics pose to honest political debate.  This is the essential book for every citizen who wants to understand how George W. Bush has misled the nation and why, if left unchallenged, all the President's spin could soon become standard practice -- a devastating development for our democracy.",

Nurture is the nuts or frosting, but if you\u2019re a spice cake, you\u2019re a spice cake, and nothing is going to change you into an angel food.Tall, slender Violet Mathers is growing up in the Great Depression, which could just as well define her state of mind. Abandoned by her mother as a child, mistreated by her father, and teased by her schoolmates (\u201cHey, Olive Oyl, where\u2019s Popeye?\u201d), the lonely girl finds solace in artistic pursuits. Only when she\u2019s hired by the town\u2019s sole feminist to work the night shift in the local thread factory does Violet come into her name, and bloom. Accepted by her co-workers, the teenager enters the happiest phase of her life, until a terrible accident causes her to retreat once again into her lonely shell.Realizing that she has only one clear choice, Violet boards a bus heading west to California. But when the bus crashes in North Dakota, it seems that Fate is having another cruel laugh at Violet\u2019s expense. This time though, Violet laughs back. She and her fellow passengers are rescued by two men: Austin Sykes, whom Violet is certain is the blackest man to ever set foot on the North Dakota prairie, and Kjel Hedstrom, who inspires feelings Violet never before has felt. Kjel and Austin are musicians whose sound is like no other, and with pluck, verve, and wit, Violet becomes part of their quest to make a new kind of music together. Oh My Stars is Lorna Landvik\u2019s most ambitious novel yet, with a cast of characters whose travails and triumphs you\u2019ll long remember.

        "Title": "Venice Rediscovered",
        "Authors": "By Pemble, John",
        "Description": "Venice, the city of the soul. In the two centuries since its political extinction, this shabby relic of a despised tyranny has become one of our greatest modern icons. As American consul Edmund Flagg wrote in 1853, in words that hold true today, \"To one weary of the world...there is not a spot in all Italy--in all the world perhaps--as beautiful as Venice.\"   In Venice Rediscovered, historian John Pemble traces the development of our modern passion for the city of canals, charting its evolution from a forgotten oddity in the 18th century to a celebrated center for the arts, a city that saw its glory in the years before World War I as home for a great expatriate community and host to a golden age in literature. He begins his history in 1797, when Venice, still accessible only by sea, ceased to be a sovereign republic and saw its captains and the kings depart. A viaduct across the lagoon would not be opened until a half century later, and in 1857 a railway was completed to Milan. For the first time, Venice was within reach of the travelling public of Europe and the United States. By 1881, Henry James could write of tour guides \"leading their helpless captives through churches and galleries in dense, irresponsible groups,\" but Pemble maintains that it was the development of the Lido beach resort that finally put Venice on the map for the chic international clientele. The combination of architectural wonder, literary associations, and seaside sophistication built a scene that led Ezra Pound to wryly remark in 1913 that Venice \"seemed yesterday like one large Carlton Hotel.\"    Drawing on an international range of published and unpublished sources, Pemble links this transfiguration of Venice to the larger current of social and intellectual changes sweeping Europe and North America. Evoking the enduring appeal of Venice to novelists, historians, and other apostles of culture--Pound, James, Ruskin, Proust, Mann, and Nietzche among them--Pemble explains how their perceptions of the city gradually changed, and how they created the language and the imagery that shaped one of the most potent paradoxes of modern culture--Venice as a paragon of a timeless but fading elegance, constantly worshipped yet forever dying, sinking daily into the canals that define it.   Though the famed literary center has given way to museum tours and moonlit gondoliers, Venice remains a destination of distinction for travellers from around the world. A searching exploration of our eternal fascination with a city that continues to inspire artists, writers, and lovers alike, Venice Rediscovered is an important contribution to our understanding of modern culture and will captivate anyone who has ever visited--or dreamed of visiting--Venice itself.",

        "Description": "Fairy tales can come true. It can happen to you. If you don't watch out.  An electrifying debut novel of supernatural terror, a twisted take on the small-town shocker, Wither bristles with pure storytelling magic. In a current-day New England college town, a Salem-era witches' coven is resurrected, and a harrowing history repeats itself -- with a vengeance.  Windale, Massachusetts, is a proud old town that embraces its colonial heritage -- including the legend of a dark witches' coven dating back three hundred years. Now a cause for tongue-in-cheek Halloween revelry, no one in Windale actually believes in witches. But three people, unknown to one another, are experiencing vivid nightmares of palpable horror. The dreams are their only connection to a terrifying truth: a dreadful presence is working its way into their waking lives -- and is coming for them.  Wendy Ward, a student at Windale's Danfield College, is known around campus as the college president's daughter -- and an offbeat dabbler in the occult. While her Freshman Lit classmates study Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables, Wendy tries her hand at real witchcraft: concocting well-intentioned charms and conjuring the art of white magic. But nothing can protect her from true evil....  Karen Glazer, a Danfield College professor, is eagerly anticipating the birth of her daughter. But she can't suppress her growing dread that the baby is not safe.  Something, someone, wants to take the life from within her, wants to claim her unborn child....  Abby MacNeil, a lonely eight-year-old, stumbles upon three ancient gravemarkers in the woods, earthly evidence that Windale's witches, a trio of blood sisters executed by hanging, were once very real. Standing among the time-worn stones, Abby is overtaken by a curious calm -- and a sense that she has finally found a home....  On a crisp autumn night, Wendy ventures into the woods to perform a harmless channeling ritual -- but unwittingly opens the floodgates to terrifying forces that have, until then, lived only in their dreams. The coven that arises is horrifying beyond imagination: a breed of demonic creature with the power to shatter an unsuspecting town.  In the bestselling tradition of Stephen King and Peter Straub, Wither is a tale of spine-tingling horror...irresistible, and masterfully told.",

Among its revelations: How Western scientists Oppenheimer, Fermi, Szilard, Gamow, and Pontecorvo provided, or knowingly allowed transfer of, scientific information essential to the USSR's atom bomb project; how on Stalin's direct orders Sudoplatov organized Trotsky's assassination; the Rosenbergs' real role in Soviet atomic espionage; how Raoul Wallenberg died; how Sudoplatov planted a mole to feed disinformation to the German high command; why Stalin invented the Doctor's Plot and Zionist conspiracy, how he destroyed Soviet Jewry; how Stalin created the Berlin crisis to keep Truman from using nuclear weapons against the imminent Chinese Communist victory; and how Khrushchev and his colleagues engineered Beria's arrest and execution to whitewash their own complicity in Stalin's crimes.",

        "Description": "\"Cahill is insightful, wry, and highly entertaining as he explores the cultural influences, social expectations, and tricky politics of the day. He examines the New Testament in this light, yet remains respectful. His goal, he states early, is to ascertain whether Jesus made a difference. His conclusion is unequivocal.\"--Christian Science MonitorIn Desire of the Everlasting Hills, Thomas Cahill takes up his most daring and provocative subject yet: Jesus of Nazareth, the central figure of Western civilization.Introducing us first to \"the people Jesus knew,\" Thomas Cahill describes the oppressive Roman political presence, the pervasive Greek cultural influence, and especially the widely varied social and religious context of the Judaism in which Jesus moved and flourished. These backgrounds, essential to a complete understanding of Jesus, lead to the author's stunningly original interpretation of the New Testament--much of it based on material from the ancient Greek brilliantly translated by the author himself--that will delight readers and surprise even biblical scholars.Thomas Cahill's most unusual skill may lie in his ability to bring to life people of a faraway world whose concerns seem at first to be utterly removed from the present day. We see Jesus as a real person, sharp-witted and sharp-tongued, but kind, humorous, and affectionate, shadowed by the inevitable climax of crucifixion, the cruelest form of execution ever devised by humankind. Mary, while not quite the \"perpetual virgin\" of popular piety, is a vivid presence and forceful influence on her son. And the apostle Paul, the carrier of Jesus' message and most important figure in the early Jesus movement (which became Christianity), finds rehabilitation in Cahill's realistic, revealing portrait of him.The third volume in the Hinges of History series, this unique presentation of Jesus and his times is for believers and nonbelievers alike (for Jews and Christians, it is intended by the author as an act of reconciliation).

        "Description": "\"In the last ten years, the United States\u2014the most powerful and technically advanced society in human history\u2014has been confronted by a series of ominous, seemingly intractable crises. First there was the threat to the environmental survival; then there was the apparent shortage of energy: and now there is the unexpected decline of the economy. These are usually regarded as separate afflictions, each to be solved in its own terms: environmental degradation by pollution controls; the energy crisis by finding new sources of energy and new ways of conserving it; the economic crisis by manipulating prices, taxes, and interest rates.But each effort to solve one crisis seems to clash with the solution of the others\u2014pollution control reduces energy supplies; energy conservation jobs. Inevitably, proponents of one solution become opponents of the others. Policy stagnates and remedial action is paralyzed, adding to the confusion and gloom that beset the country.\" So opens Barry Commoner's The Poverty of Power, the book in which America's great biologist and environmentalist addresses himself to the central question of our day. He concludes that \"what confronts us is not a series of separate crises, but a single basic deficit\u2014a fault that lies deep in the design of modern society. This book is an effort to unearth that fault, to trace its relation to the separate crises, and to consider what can be done to correct it at its root.\"",

Sweeping us back to the enigmatic and elusive land of his best-selling Shogun, he weaves an extraordinary tale of Japan, now newly open to gai-jin - foreigners - and teeming with contradictions as the ancient and the modern meet in a clash of cultures, of nations, of generations.It is 1862, and in Japan's Foreign Settlement of Yokohama, reverberations from an explosive act of violence will forever alter - and connect - the lives of the major characters. Malcolm Struan, at twenty, is heir to the title of tai-pan of the most powerful and bitterly contested English trading company in the Orient, the Noble House. Malcolm's fate, and that of his family's legacy, become inextricably intertwined with that of a beautiful young French woman, Angelique Richaud. Desired by many, loved purely and passionately by Malcolm, Angelique will hold the future of the Noble House in her hands.Intricately interwoven into the story of the struggle for control of the Noble House is a powerful parallel story of the Land of the Gods, Japan, a country ripped apart by greed, idealism, and terrorism as groups of young xenophobic revolutionaries, ronin, attempt to seize the Shogunate and expel the hated gai-jin from Japan. One man, Lord Toranaga Yoshi, a direct descendant of the first Toranaga Shogun, attempts not only to protect the Shogunate, but to usher it, and Japan, into the modern age.Amid the brutality and heroism, the betrayals and the stunning romance, a multilayered, complex story unfolds. Here the dark and erotic world of the pleasure houses - the Ladies of the Willow World, spies, and terrorists - meets the world of pageantry and power - monarchs and diplomats. And here East meets West in an inevitable collision of two equally powerful cultures as James Clavell creates a vibrant and authentic portrait of a time that is gone forever...but of a world not unlike our own.",

Mitchell Wilson, an American expatriate and economist for the Ministry of Agriculture, becomes unwittingly embroiled in an internecine war between rival factions of the government. Into this potentially eruptive scene enters a woman, Johanna, whom Mitchell once loved and lost but who remains an enchanting and powerful temptation - one he will not resist.At once a beguiling love story and a superbly sophisticated political novel about the fruits of imperialism in the twentieth century, Swimming in the Volcano is as brutally seductive a novel as the world it evokes. Triumphantly compassionate, and imbued with Shacochis's insight into human affairs that \"ranks with the best of Conrad and Hemingway,\" here is a commanding performance by \"one of the most talented young writers working in America today.\"",

There's Todd, the handsome stay-at-home dad dubbed \"The Prom King\" by the moms of the playground; Sarah, a lapsed feminist with a bisexual past, who seems to have stumbled into a traditional marriage; Richard, Sarah's husband, who has found himself more and more involved with a fantasy life on the internet than with the flesh and blood in his own house; and Mary Ann, who thinks she has it all figured out, down to scheduling a weekly roll in the hay with her husband, every Tuesday at 9pm. They all raise their kids in the kind of sleepy American suburb where nothing ever seems to happen-at least until one eventful summer, when a convicted child molester moves back to town, and two restless parents begin an affair that goes further than either of them could have imagined. Unexpectedly suspenseful, but written with all the fluency and dark humor of Perrotta's previous novels,  Little Children exposes the adult dramas unfolding amidst the swingsets and slides of an ordinary American playground.",

        "Description": "Taking our present ignorance of science and technology as a symptom of profound cultural malaise, writer and physicist Joseph Schwartz offers a provocative and fascinating look back into the history of science to find out how it progressively lost touch with the rest of society.Acting as a sort of science critic, Schwartz examines a range of great \"creative moments,\" from seventeenth-century Florence and Galileo (whose decision to describe his theories in mathematical language avoided trouble with the Church, but began the trend to number-worship in physics) to Cold Spring Harbor in 1946 and the invention of molecular biology, which ultimately fostered a way of thinking so restrictive that it may now be imperiling the search for an AIDS cure.Why Einstein's relativity theory is so famously arcane, when it ought not to be....Why the bomb-makers of Los Alamos allowed themselves to be manipulated by the military....Why physicists have come up with almost no new ideas since the 1920s....These are the kinds of questions The Creative Moment tackles and illuminates with a freshness and knowledgeability that is the hallmark of a truly new approach to understanding science and technology.",

        "Description": "Many have called America an empire, and many have also criticized the ostensibly \"imperial\" way in which the nation uses its power. But in The Case for Goliath, Michael Mandelbaum, one of America's leading foreign policy thinkers, takes this thinking to task. He explains that the United States uses its enormous power not as an empire but to provide the world with the services of a government. The role it plays, he shows, is, on balance, positive, and is performed with the tacit consent of many of the nation's critics. And this has all come to pass even though neither the United States nor any other country sought to make it happen.Mandelbaum describes the contributions that American power makes to global security, while also noting that the most important of these contributions are the least controversial and receive the least attention. He identifies the many American contributions to global prosperity, as well as the dangers to the health of the international economy posed by U. S. energy policies and the worldwide role of the dollar. And he shows how the foreign policy innovations of the Clinton and Bush administrations, which are usually thought to be polar opposites, in fact closely resemble each other.The Case for Goliath analyzes the ways in which other countries have come to accept, resent, and exert influence on America's global role, and it assesses the uncertain prospects for sharing the burden of global governance more widely, through a multilateral approach to international security and the management of the global economy.",

Brian Lamb has visited the gravesites of every American president, living and dead, in order to put together this book, with assistance from the staff of C-SPAN. Heavily illustrated and with contributions from historians Richard Norton Smith and Douglas Brinkley, Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb?  is about the presidents' lives as much as it is about their final resting places. The book's collection of the presidents' last words, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt's \"I have a terrific headache\" to John Adams's \"Thomas Jefferson still survives\" offers a poignant and sometimes humorous look at the last moments of the great men. This is a great way to encounter the presidents, from the great ones to the near-forgottens. Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb?  belongs in the glove box of every traveler and the bedside table of every fan of the American presidency and American history.",

        "Title": "The Haldeman Diaries: Inside the Nixon White House",
        "Authors": "By Haldeman, H. R.",
        "Description": "\"It is probable H. R. Haldeman never told all he knew about Nixon's role, the Watergate cover-up, or the Administration's abusive tactics against its political enemies,\" wrote Newsweek upon Haldeman's death on November 12, 1993. \"He takes [those] secrets - and whatever else he knew - to final judgment.\"But not all he knew, nor all the secrets. When Haldeman died, he left behind a profound legacy that few knew existed - four years, three months of diaries, which he wrote and dictated every day that he was Chief of Staff for President Richard Nixon. These diaries, never before published, offer a fascinating portrait of an era and a White House that still haunt American history and politics to this day.With keen observations and complete frankness, this record, written for Haldeman alone, reflects an unvarnished view of the triumphs and tragedy of those years. Here is a riveting portrait of that period's more celebrated events - the Cambodia bombings, the Kent State killings, the ground-breaking Russia and China trips, the 1972 election campaign, the Vietnam peace negotiations, the power struggles of the White House staff, the manipulations and headaches caused by Henry Kissinger, the beginning of the fall of Spiro Agnew, and, especially, the Watergate scandal - written exactly as they happened and reported in astonishing detail. More important, here is a fresh view of Richard Nixon, by the man who knew him best.Nixon, who was the biggest star of his own drama, is revealed more intimately than we have ever seen him - shrewd, complex, petty, obsessive, sensitive, manipulative, and self-absorbed.Here we learn of Nixon's double-cross of Senator Howard Baker and his chance for a Supreme Court seat; Nixon's plan to photograph Ted Kennedy in compromising positions, then leak the photos to the press; Nixon's attempts to get John Connally to replace Agnew on the 1972 ticket; how Nixon attempted to get LBJ to fix the Senate Watergate investigation; and how Nixon's inner circle hunted for a fall guy as the Watergate drama unfolded, and who some of the surprising candidates were....The Haldeman Diaries is perhaps the most meticulously reported and eye-opening chronicle we will ever have of those years, a definitive insider's account so illuminating and candid that we will never look at the Nixon White House in the same way again.",
