Paris Armstrong never saw it coming. With two grown children and  a lovely home in Connecticut, Paris was happy with her marriage, her family, her  life. So when her husband of twenty-four years said they needed to talk, Paris couldn\u2019 t imagine what he was about to say.  \u201cI want a divorce,\u201d Peter tells her. Just like  that, the husband she adored had dumped her for a younger woman. And just like that,  Peter and his thirty-one-year-old lover had made their plans for their future, leaving  Paris to pick up the pieces of a shattered life. Within days, Peter was gone. And  Paris was left to figure out how she intended to get through the next day, let alone  the rest of her life.  The task could not have been more painful.  First came the  tears. Then the excruciating attempts by well-meaning friends to \u201cfix her up\u201d with  men who paled in comparison to Peter.  Worse yet, she still loved him.  Finally,  Paris realized she was in a fight for her very survival. Drastic measures were called  for. Even her shrink agreed. It was time to move\u2014as far away as possible, just after  Peter remarried.  Paris had never felt, or been, more alone.  Saying good-bye to  the world she knew and loved, Paris heads west, to San Francisco, and discovers being  single in a world full of men who were too young, too old, too married, or too good  to be true. For Paris, the list seemed endless...the charming commitment-phobe...the  drunken Neanderthal...the young Frenchman\u2014so adorably sexy she almost forgot about  his age, and did, for a while. With her dating track record veering between disappointing  and disastrous, and her daughter now engaged to a man Paris\u2019s age, Paris finally  comes to the conclusion that romance is not in her future. That\u2019s when her small  circle of offbeat, loving friends becomes more important than ever before. And a  decision Paris makes only for herself changes her life once more.  The secret, she  discovers finally, is in finding the gifts in life\u2019s unexpected twists and turns,  and turning despair into freedom and loss into joy.  In a poignant, wickedly funny  novel about getting dumped and getting over it, about tackling life with both courage  and laughter, Danielle Steel explores what it means to start over, whether you wanted  to or not, and finding something better than you had before.",

        "Title": "Relentless Pursuit: A True Story of Family, Murder, and the Prosecutor Who Wouldn't Quit",
        "Authors": "By Flynn, Kevin",
        "Description": "As a federal homicide prosecutor, Kevin Flynn is a firsthand witness to the worst of human depravity, and to the devastating impact it can have on the survivors - the family and friends who remain behind. Over time, Flynn has coped by gradually walling himself off from the ache and hopelessness he sees on those survivors' faces, distancing himself from the knowledge that, so often, their coming to terms with loss hinges largely on his bringing the killer to justice.But that protective barrier was stripped away by Diane Hawkins and her thirteen-year-old daughter, Katrina. Diane, a single mother of six, was the undisputed magnet of a vibrant community of family and friends; at one time or another, her nieces and nephews, aunts and cousins had all called upon her, drawing on a seemingly limitless supply of compassion and optimism. All this was taken away when Diane and Katrina were murdered in their Washington, D.C. home on a warm May night.The police arrived, an investigation began, an arrest warrant was issued. A day later, one of the detectives showed up in Kevin Flynn's office and began describing the horrors of what he had seen. Flynn knew that he wanted the chance to prosecute Diane and Katrina's killer.Flynn interviewed police officers and forensic specialists, blood spatter experts and crime scene photographers - hardened veterans who would still remember the case in stark detail more than a decade later. He became closely involved with Diane and Katrina's family, a large, inner-city congregration of African-Americans whose faith seemed to provide true comfort and resolve.On the eve of the trial, Kevin Flynn's own life was thrown into turmoil when his father was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. As Flynn struggled to balance the demands of the case with his responsibilities as the only son of a dying parent, he found himself the beneficiary of the care and attention from this newfound community. The consideration and perspective of the friends and family of Diane and Katrina helped him through a difficult time. Moved by this kindness, his resolve to win a conviction grew stronger even as his father's health deteriorated.Relentless Pursuit is more than a moment-by-moment account of a prosecutor's life as seen through the lens of a single case: it is, above all, a story of healing and community, a story in which, in the end, the system works, and - for once - justice prevails.",

Anyone flying over Maine should remember: it's illegal there to step out of the plane while it's in the air. And why can't the chicken cross the road in Quitman, Georgia? Because it's \"fowl\" criminal behavior. That's just the beginning, because this collection also uncovers some of the most incredible, unbelievable lawsuits, government grants, and court verdicts.

        "Title": "Shark Tales: True (and Amazing) Stories from America's Lawyers",
        "Authors": "By Liebman, Ronald S. (EDT)",
        "Description": "QUESTION: How many lawyers does it take to finish the roof of a two-thousand-square-foot house with dormers?  ANSWER: Depends on how thin you slice them.  Lawyers, and, more to the point, lawyer stories, have been sliced, diced, and presented for consumption for centuries. Ever since Dick the Butcher suggested in Shakespeare's Henry VI Part 2 that \"the first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers,\" the profession has exhibited a strong appeal for readers...to say nothing of an enduring image problem. Today, stories about life on the front lines of the nation's courtrooms fuel everything from the novels of John Grisham and Scott Turow to television shows like The Practice, Ally McBeal, and L.A. Law. Now in Shark Tales comes a remarkable collection of witty, eccentric, and astounding war stories -- guaranteed to be mostly true -- supplied by hundreds of attorneys and displaying the nitty-gritty of life in court.  To create Shark Tales, famed Washington lawyer Ron Liebman solicited stories from hundreds of colleagues in America and Britain...and not just any stories. He asked them to supply humor, of course, but also to describe the day on which they were proudest to be lawyers, and the day when they were most ashamed. He asked for stories of wild divorces and tragic losses. He asked them to describe the worst judges and best witnesses they'd ever encountered. He reviewed actual court transcripts, and found material like the following:  QUESTION: Doctor, how many autopsies have you performed on dead people?  ANSWER: All my autopsies have been on dead people.  Here is the tale of a case settled not by a fingerprint left behind at the scene of the crime, but an entire finger. Here is a lawyer agreeing to defend a client accused of passing bad checks...a client who promptly bounced the retainer check. Here you'll meet a proud son, having won his first case, telling his father -- also a lawyer -- that \"justice has triumphed,\" to which the father replied, \"Appeal at once.\" And here is a senior partner in a Washington law firm meeting with a group of Japanese corporate clients with whom he seems compelled to reminisce about the first time he saw Tokyo: as a bomber pilot in 1945.  Funny, revealing, sad, poignant, and even exciting, Shark Tales is a hugely entertaining book for legal junkies -- authentic slices of life that reveal what really makes the law everyone's obsession.",

Schoen, a renowned and widely respected veterinarian, shares healing secrets he has learned from patients as diverse as a wounded hawk, a rabbit who showed him how love can conquer death, and a German shepherd brought back to life after going into cardiac arrest. Dr. Schoen's groundbreaking insights are the products not of one man's fancy but of his frustration with the limitations of conventional medicine. While other vets pronounce a death sentence on seemingly hopeless cases, Schoen has never been content just to \"put the dog down,\" or \"ship the cow,\" or \"put the horse out of his misery.\" Instead, he has pushed beyond conventional medical wisdom to chart new courses of healing. And time and time again, he has discovered that the deep spiritual relationship that develops between him and his animal patients, between owners and their pets, and even between animals themselves is a vital part of the healing process.",

Inevitably, Master Yehudi and Walt fall prey to the sinners thieves, and villains of America in its pre-depression heyday, from the Kansas Ku Klux Klan to the Chicago mob, and Walt's resilience, like that of his young nation, is over and again challenged.Paul Auster, a \"literary original\" (Wall Street Journal) whose \"bounties of intelligence, mystery and literary magic nourish and delight the mind\" (Chicago Sun-Times), embraces both the realist and the mythic traditions in American literature.

        "Authors": "By Jeffries, John C., Jr.",
        "Description": "Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. is an absorbing and readable biography of one of the most important Supreme Court Justices since World War II. From abortion to affirmative action to the constitutionality of capital punishment, Powell's pivotal votes helped determine the great issues of the mid-twentieth century.Nominated to the Supreme Court in 1971, along with future Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Powell was expected to join a staunchly conservative bloc of Nixon appointees who would roll back the innovations of the Warren Court. Instead, Powell quickly established himself as an independent voice, the decisive \"swing\" vote at the center of an ideologically divided Court.With access to Powell's private papers, author John Jeffries provides an engrossing insider's account of the most controversial decisions of Powell's career. These include Roe v. Wade, which first extended constitutional protection to abortion; the Bakke decision, which allowed race-based affirmative action; decisions wrestling with the constitutionality of the death penalty; the Watergate tapes case, which led to the resignation of a President; decisions on school desegregation and busing; and Bowers v. Hardwick, the 1986 Georgia sodomy case that Powell now feels he decided incorrectly.Jeffries also covers Powell's pre-Court life, including his World War II experience with top-secret \"Ultra\" intelligence, his role in building one of the South's greatest law firms, and his leadership in providing legal services to the poor. Most important was Powell's chairmanship of the Richmond School Board during the turbulent years of \"massive resistance\" to desegregation. Criticism of his performance in that capacity is carefully examined, and Powell's behind-the-scenes maneuvering to keep the schools open is fully revealed for the first time.Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. is not only fascinating reading but a major contribution to American history.",

        "Title": "The Faith Club: A Muslim, A Christian, A Jew-- Three Women Search for Understanding",
        "Authors": "By Idliby, Ranya, Oliver, Suzanne, and Warner, Priscilla",
        "Description": "\"Welcome to the Faith Club. We're three mothers from three faiths -- Islam, Christianity, and Judaism -- who got together to write a picture book for our children that would highlight the connections between our religions. But no sooner had we started talking about our beliefs and how to explain them to our children than our differences led to misunderstandings. Our project nearly fell apart.\"After September 11th, Ranya Idliby, an American Muslim of Palestinian descent, faced constant questions about Islam, God, and death from her children, the only Muslims in their classrooms. Inspired by a story about Muhammad, Ranya reached out to two other mothers -- a Christian and a Jew -- to try to understand and answer these questions for her children. After just a few meetings, however, it became clear that the women themselves needed an honest and open environment where they could admit -- and discuss -- their concerns, stereotypes, and misunderstandings about one another. After hours of soul-searching about the issues that divided them, Ranya, Suzanne, and Priscilla grew close enough to discover and explore what united them.The Faith Club is a memoir of spiritual reflections in three voices that will make readers feel as if they are eavesdropping on the authors' private conversations, provocative discussions, and often controversial opinions and conclusions. The authors wrestle with the issues of anti-Semitism, prejudice against Muslims, and preconceptions of Christians at a time when fundamentalists dominate the public face of Christianity. They write beautifully and affectingly of their families, their losses and grief, their fears and hopes for themselves and their loved ones. And as the authors reveal their deepest beliefs, readers watch the blossoming of a profound interfaith friendship and the birth of a new way of relating to others. In a final chapter, they provide detailed advice on how to start a faith club: the questions to ask, the books to read, and most important, the open-minded attitude to maintain in order to come through the experience with an enriched personal faith and understanding of others.Pioneering, timely, and deeply thoughtful, The Faith Club's caring message will resonate with people of all faiths.For more information or to start your own faith club visit www.thefaithclub.com",

Tippett's in-depth conversations with theologians, scientists, ethicists, and seekers who share their experiences, combined with her engaging style, are revolutionizing the way many think and speak of faith in their families and communities and in the larger world.--From publisher description.",

Bush became president under some of the most unusual circumstances in U.S. history, with the very legitimacy of his claim to victory a matter of strong public debate. In spite of the highly contested election that brought him to power, Bush came into office with assertiveness and resolve, surprising many of his critics with a successful early push for tax reduction and other domestic initiatives. However, the shattering events of September 11, 2001 forced the Bush administration to refocus its agenda. Since that day, the power of the presidency--as well as its limitations--have been at the forefront of the public's mind.   Considering the Bush Presidency offers a wide-ranging scholarly review and analysis of the George W. Bush presidency. Written by leading political scientists, this collection features timely and unique essays that cover such topics as the Bush transition, staffing the Bush presidency, battles over executive privilege, Bush and presidential war powers, the vice presidency of Dick Cheney, and the relationship between the president and Congress. With selections that balance popular topics and theoretical rigor, Considering the Bush Presidency is ideal for introductory American politics and presidency courses.",

        "Title": "All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families",
        "Authors": "By Wead, Doug",
        "Description": "From Abigail \"Nabby\" Adams to Barbara and Jenna Bush, George Washington Adams to John F. Kennedy, Jr., the children of America's presidents have both suffered and triumphed under the watchful eyes of their powerful fathers and the glare of the ever-changing public. Many, like the children of William Henry Harrison and Andrew Johnson, writhed under the pressure and fought bitter battles with alcoholism and depression only to die young. Others, like Robert Todd Lincoln, Margaret Truman, and Helen Taft Manning, used the privileges granted them to achieve their own success in the worlds of politics, business, and academia. All, however, had to cope with the entirely unique experience of sharing their fathers with the country that called them to leadership and living a life worthy of their place in history.  Combining twenty years of study with never-before-published letters and personal accounts from presidential children, Doug Wead has produced a remarkable and authoritative analysis of the extraordinary people born to American presidents throughout history.  Stories of outstanding presidential daughters; the eight weddings performed in the White House and what later happened in the marriages; tales of the real and rumored illegitimate children ofthe presidents; a list of presidential children who pursued politics and the five who were almost president themselves; examples of how the pressures of being a celebrity child interrupt the normal desire for intimacy and personal identity; biographies of living presidential children and where they are now -- these are just a few of the historical gems unearthed.  Both an entertaining lesson on our nation's history, a study of the problems and solutions of high-achieving parents, and a fascinating look at the father-son dynamics of the current White House, All the Presidents' Children is a must-read for anyone interested in America's most high-profile pedigree.",

        "Authors": "By May, Ernest R. (EDT) and Zelikow, Philip D. (EDT)",
        "Description": "October 1962: the United States and the Soviet Union stood eyeball to eyeball, each brandishing enough nuclear weapons to obliterate civilization in the Northern Hemisphere. It was one of the most dangerous moments in world history. Day by day, for two weeks, the inner circle of President Kennedy's National Security Council debated what to do, twice coming to the brink of attacking Soviet military units in Cuba--units equipped for nuclear retaliation. And through it all, unbeknownst to any of the participants except the President himself, tape was rolling, capturing for posterity the deliberations that might have ended the world as we know it.These are the full and authenticated transcripts of those audio recordings. Arguably the most important document in the history of the Cuban missile crisis, these transcripts are also a unique window on a drama rarely if ever witnessed by those outside the halls of power: the moment-by-moment decisionmaking of those with the fate of the West in their hands in a constantly changing, world-threatening situation. At the center of it all is President Kennedy, wary of experts after the debacle of the Bay of Pigs, puzzled and distrustful after confrontations with Khrushchev in Vienna and Berlin, and ever mindful of the responsibility symbolized by the satchel his military aides hold nearby, containing the codes to unleash nuclear warfare.In one brief segment, midway through the crisis, the President, alone, speaks his thoughts into the machine. In others, he copes with hawks from Capitol Hill and the Pentagon. And in the last meeting, we hear him explaining and defending the formula that finally defused the crisis. With him throughout are his team from the State Department, including Secretary Dean Rusk, Under Secretary George Ball, and Llewellyn Thompson; his Defense team, especially Robert McNamara; his key assistants, Theodore Sorenson and McGeorge Bundy; Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon; Vice President Lyndon Johnson; and, of course, his brother Robert, the Attorney General. All are identified and put into their proper context by the editors, whose introduction makes sense of this singular drama within the history of the Cold War and the Kennedy administration and whose conclusions will shape our understanding of the Cold War.",

Now this masterful author, whose books have sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, takes us through a season of friendship, discovery, betrayal, and love to tell a story of four friends and the events that shaped their futures.  Leigh, Cady, Vanessa, and Susan meet when they become roommates in a townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side. New York in 1963 is a place of magical enchantment and infinite possibilities, especially when you're young and eager for the adventure a big city offers. Even being crammed together in a single bedroom with a kitchen too small to accommodate a table and chairs can't diminish their high spirits. A casting assistant at a talent company, Leigh is the level-headed one, the calm at the center of the whirlwind that is their lives. Cady is a prep-school teacher, emotional, passionate, and ready for love. Vanessa, a stewardess, craves her independence above all else. Susan is the wild card. Mercurial and unconventional, she makes a decision that will have far-reaching consequences in her life-and in the lives, through the years, of the others.  Sleeping and dreaming side by side, Leigh, Cady, Vanessa, and Susan could not know the decisions they made in 1963 would be challenged later, not only because they had been young when they made them, but because the world itself was going to change around them. And then, of course, there were the events in their young lives that no one could control...the events that changed everything.",
