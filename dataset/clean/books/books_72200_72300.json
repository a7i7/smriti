Cultural stigmas that once kept sex within definable boundaries have all but disappeared. Anyone can fall prey to sexual temptation or become the target of a sexual aggressor. Any man or woman who has contact with the opposite sex\u2014whether at church, in the workplace, or at play\u2014needs the vital information contained in these pages. Would you recognize a sexually charged relationship soon enough to avoid falling into an affair? Would you be able to help a friend, loved one, or someone you're counseling avoid such a relationship?

        "Description": "Comprehensive, practical, and exhaustively illustrated, The Garden Sourcebook is the only book you will need in order to plan, plant, and maintain your garden.The book begins with an overview of all the basic principles of garden planning - whether you're creating a new garden or adapting an existing one - giving expert guidelines on how to assess your garden's potential in terms of climate, soil, and sun. \"The Look of the Garden\" explores the basic elements that give the garden its character - style, color, shape, and texture - as well as the most popular styles of gardening, from English cottage gardens to Japanese water gardens. Next is a discussion of the hard surfaces of the garden - walls, fences and hedging, paths and steps, and the wealth of surfacing materials, from stone and rock to concrete and gravel. \"Garden Features\" is a visual catalog of ornamental and architectural features packed with advice on how to choose the most appropriate screen, trellis, arbor, pool, or fountain.Finally, the longest section, \"The Plant Selector\" is a photographic index of more than 500 plants organized within categories (e.g. hedges, shrubs, borders) not alphabetically, but by characteristic. Let's say you want a border that flowers all year. You look under \"border\" and find the subcategory \"flowering.\" There you will find a selection of flowering borders, and from the descriptions of their needs (light, soil, moisture) and characteristics (shape of the leaf, duration of the flower, compatible plants), you will be able to select the plant best for your garden.Informing the book are three convictions: that all aspects of the garden must work in harmony, that attention to detail is vitally important, and that only the best plants and materials will ensure success. With more than 1,000 superb photographs and 300 illustrations, The Garden Sourcebook leaves nothing to the imagination except the infinite possibilities it enables you to master.",

        "Title": "Leading Beyond the Walls: Developing Congregations with a Heart for the Unchurched",
        "Authors": "By Hamilton, Adam and Schaller, Lyle E. (FRW)",
        "Description": "Good pastoral leadership is not a \"by the numbers\" proposition. It is a matter of heart and soul, of devoting the whole self to the vision God gives for the congregation in which one serves. Yet neither is it purely intuitive; it requires hard, careful thinking about the directions and details of the path down which God calls. When Adam Hamilton became pastor of the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection, its membership consisted of himself and his family. Ten years later the church averages between five and six thousand worshipers per weekend. Throughout this remarkable period, Hamilton\u00a0learned many serious lessons about both the broad visions and the specific details of pastoral leadership. Bringing a depth of analytical skills often lacking in visionary leaders, in this book he goes beyond simply telling the story of Church of the Resurrection. He shares the questions that he learned to ask about the largely unchurched population to which Church of the Resurrection has reached out. Further, he demonstrates what he learned by listening to the answers to these questions, and how doing so has made possible a number of strategically crucial decisions the church has made. One of those crucial decisions was to make more traditional forms of worship and praise the center of the congregation's life. The result is that the example of Church of the Resurrection offers pastors and church leaders (especially those in\u00a0mainline denominations) the realization that they need not completely change their liturgical and theological identity in order to reach out to the unchurched. Drawing on his own experience, as well as the detailed research on the characteristics of highly successful congregations he undertook during a sabbatical leave, Hamilton offers pastors and other church leaders solid, substantive thinking on steps that congregations can take to become centers of vibrant outreach and mission.Also available in:Adobe Ebook\u00a0 9780687026753Microsoft Ebook 9780687027491",

        "Title": "Italian Pure & Simple: Robust and Rustic Home Cooking for Every Day",
        "Authors": "By Wright, Clifford A.",
        "Description": "These family dishes are easy to make and delicious - their bold flavors will excite the palate while their simplicity will delight the cook! Author Cliff Wright understands hectic schedules, hungry stomachs, and the passion for homey Italian fare, and he proves that if you can turn on the stove, you can prepare a satisfying meal in no time.There are recipes for every part of the meal - enticing antipasti (like Ricotta and Hazelnut Fritters), deliciously filling meat and fish dishes (Sear-Crusted Thyme and White Pepper Steak; Grilled Salmon with Artichoke, Oyster, and Rosemary Sauce; Chicken with Three Onions), vegetables that are delightfully done (Panfried Yellow Peppers and Mushrooms) and refreshingly satisfying fruit desserts (Ripe Peaches in Rose Water Syrup). Then, of course, there's pasta - more than 65 recipes for pasta with vegetables (Spaghetti with Spinach, Raisins, and Pine Nuts), pasta with cheese (Cavatelli with Creamy Cheese Fondue), pasta with meat (Penne with Roasted Chestnuts and Grilled Sausage), and pasta with seafood (Linguine with Garlicky Fried Oysters).But that's not all - Cliff lets you know what to stock in your pantry and what to look for in ingredients, and how to cook it all the Italian way. With just a little planning, a meal of Fettuccine with Ham and Warm Goat Cheese, Roasted Country Bread, and Broccoli and Roasted Red Bell Peppers can be on the table in no time. From Lentil Minestrone to Flank Steak with Walnut Pesto, from Grilled Tuna and Salsa Verde to Spinach and Fresh Ricotta Gratinate, Italian Pure and Simple emphasizes fresh ingredients, quick preparation, and lots of taste.If you love Italian food but don't think you have the time it takes to prepare it, grab the pasta, crush some garlic, steam those vegetables, and jump into this book. It's that simple.",

We learn not only how the simple dower chest evolved into the shelved cupboard of today, but also traditional methods of cleaning and restoring old furniture and flooring. We come to understand not only why and how the country kitchen functions as a family command and control center, but also the proper principles of cleaning cast-iron cookware.",

The Bush Administration, concerned about the legality of harsh interrogation techniques, understood the need to establish a legally viable argument to justify such procedures.

The plan is based on continued military preeminence, combined with greater emphasis on economic, political, and moral strengths; rebuilding of multilateral institutions without acknowledging international constraints; championing \"muscular liberalism;\" repealing Bush's tax cuts and other economic measures that will allow financial support for \"robust\" internationalism; and uniting the country for shared sacrifice. Fourteen essays explain how this agenda would work in regards to economic development aid to the Muslim world, nuclear anti-proliferation, US-Pakistani relations, UN reform, military reform, economic policy, and other issues.
