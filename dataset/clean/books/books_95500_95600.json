Desirous of being a nun, she instead obeyed her parents and married. Her husband was cruel, and caused her much suffering, to which she responded with love and prayers and eventually converted him. After the death of her husband and two sons, Rita was able to enter a convent, where she devoted herself to prayer and penance. She abandoned herself totally to God, diminishing herself as He increased in her. An inspiring story of a soul completely resigned to God\\'s will. 132 pgs, PB",

When her husband leaves her for someone whose time isn't wrapped up in a silent, handicapped kid, Mary and little Luke are out on their own in a world that has no room for the poor and disabled.  Especially not at a time when most Americans are simply trying to survive their economic woes and job losses.But then arrives The Gift...Where has it come from, and why?  How can a young boy who can neither hear nor speak provide comfort, direction, and sometimes challenges to seekers who learn of the special ability?  Whatever the source, its presence brings a single shaft of light and hope to Mary and her beloved Luke.  Will it be enough?",

Death promises to answer any of McGann's questions, but if he fails to understand the answers, he will have to pay with his life.In Los Angeles, successful film actress Arlen Ford is no longer happy living in the Hollywood fast lane. She gives up everything - her career, her house, her glamorous lifestyle - and moves to Austria, where she meets a passionate war correspondent. From the start, their relationship is all-consuming. Arlen realizes she has been waiting for this man all her life.And in Vienna, the terminally ill Wyatt Leonard suddenly discovers that he has the ability to raise the dead.How all three of these extraordinary fates converge is at the heart of Jonathan Carroll's most daring and provocative novel, in which he dares to ask - and answer - the ultimate question: What is Death?",

        "Description": "One of the fascinating aspects about hold\u2019em is its dual nature. The game is both incredibly simple and incredibly complex. If you\u2019ve watched any World Poker Tour (WPT) broadcast, you\u2019ve heard hold\u2019em described as a game that \u201ctakes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master.\u201d That is really true, and a large part of the appeal of the game is that you can sit down and learn how to play almost immediately. However, after playing a bit, you become aware that hold\u2019em has many layers, each more complex than the previous one. The deeper you develop your understanding of the game, the better your results should be. The best thing for you is this: most players never work to develop their games. What they know about the game is strictly what they draw from their personal experience at the table, much of which they don\u2019t properly interpret. In fact they often misinterpret their experience in counterproductive ways. So there is great opportunity for those who wish to invest a bit of time and effort in improving their game.  Currently, a huge number of books on limit hold\u2019em are available, with many more being written. However, very little exists for the brand new player, whose only exposure to hold\u2019em may be what he has seen on television and perhaps a few hands played at a casino or in a home game.This book provides someone who has played little or no limit hold\u2019em with a sound basic strategy that will add to both his enjoyment of the game and his bottom line. You must walk before you can run, and this book teaches those first steps.",

Dubner (the coauthor of Freakanomics) about a high-society silver thief, and an extraordinarily memorable \"ode to bar fights\" written by Jonathan Miles for Men's Journal after he punched an editor at a staff party.

From inspiring stories of real people once far from God, to practical ideas that can be applied by any local church, this book offers a refreshing vision of the potential and power of the Body of Christ to transform lives today.'We now are living in a post-Christian America---and that means we must be rethinking ministry through a missionary mindset.

Frustrated with his endless parade of drug addicts and career politicians, Fate has to watch Destiny guide her people to Nobel Peace Prizes and Super Bowl MVPs. To make matters worse, he has a five- hundred-year-old feud with Death, and his best friends are Sloth and Gluttony. And worst of all? He's fallen in love with a human.  Getting involved with a human breaks Rule #1, and about ten others, setting off some cosmic-sized repercussions that could strip him of his immortality-or lead to a fate worse than death.",

(Take that, Nancy Drew!)\" \u2014Midwest Children's Book Review  Sammy's softball team is in contention for the Junior Slugger's Cup,  and all she wants to do is hunker down behind the home plate and catch  strikes. But Heather Acosta brings new meaning to the term \"foul ball\"  as she schemes to get Sammy kicked off the team.Then Sammy is  thrown a wild pitch by a frantic girl at the mall. The girl asks Sammy  to watch her bag and dashes off before Sammy discovers that the bag  she's left holding contains a baby! When the girl doesn't return, Sammy  decides to go find her.

The Sammy Keyes mysteries are fast-paced,  funny,  thoroughly modern, and true whodunits. Each    mystery is  exciting and  dramatic, but it's the drama in Sammy's personal    life  that keeps  readers coming back to see what happens next with her     love interest  Casey, her soap-star mother, and her mysterious father.",

        "Description": "After fifteen weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list, God's Politics not only changed the conversation about faith and politics in this country, it began a movement. All across the country, wherever Jim Wallis spoke, people were frustrated by tax cuts and budgets that widened the gap between rich and poor, aggravated by the government's lack of response to natural disasters, wearied of misinformation and the ongoing war in the Middle East, and exasperated by the impractical political rhetoric about sexual abstinence in lieu of policies that would strengthen more broadly family values and community health. Folks began asking what they could do to promote peace, economic justice, racial equality, and the sanctity of life. They wanted to know how they could influence government policies to better reflect their moral values. In response, Wallis and the editors of Sojourners magazine offer Living God's Politics, a reader's guide for putting the lessons of God's Politics into action. Who will change our government's policies to better integrate our values? We're the ones we've been waiting for, and this book offers us the tools and techniques to change the political landscape for the better.",
