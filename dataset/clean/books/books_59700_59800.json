Fans of the series will enjoy this chance to revisit the men and women who were part of the legendary American spy ring. Their fascinating exploits are further explored in the series' full novels, which includes Ring of Secrets, Whispers from the Shadows, and Circle of Spies. January 29, 1835 in Baltimore, Maryland. Twenty-year-old Julienne Lane eagerly awaits the return of her fianc\u00e9 and naval officer, Jack Arnaud, but she has not been idle. She and her best friend, Freeda Payne, have been working hard to support the abolitionist movement. Their efforts have been clouded in secrecy, but when Freeda shows up in Julienne's cellar with a runaway slave, the need for secrets becomes imperative. When Jack returns home, will Julienne threaten his career in the Navy by including him in their plans, or will she hide news of the slave from him and put his trust to the test? Moreover, why does her fianc\u00e9 appear to be hiding a secret of his own? Despite a harrowing tour of duty in the North Atlantic, Jack's hopes for rest and recuperation are put on hold. His wedding to Julienne is in two days, but a more pressing matter comes to his attention from his associates in the Culper Ring. Should he ask his beautiful fianc\u00e9e to postpone the wedding for the third time in two years? How will he and the Culper Ring foil the malicious plans they have uncovered? And why does Julienne blush so brightly when he asks her about the cellar? The clock is ticking. Danger looms. Can justice prevail? Will their love survive?",

Take a group with speed, skill, and audacity, put a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber in its hands, then send it out to find Iran's key military, industrial, and command centers, and destroy them: quickly, quietly, secretly, untraceably - the ultimate stealth attack.Under the command of aerial strike warfare expert Patrick McLanahan, the team begins its mission brilliantly - and then all hell breaks loose, as Iran and its allies take their war of intimidation further than anyone thought they would. With the Persian Gulf tottering and the situation escalating hourly, only the men and women of Future Flight, and their commando brethren, stand between the United States and a catastrophe of worldwide proportions.",

A total of 184 illustrations - including 88 full-colour pictures of Julia sets - are suggestive of a coffee-table book.However, the invited contributions which round off the book lend the text the required formality. Benoit Mandelbrot gives a very personal account, in his idiosyncratic self-centred style, of his discovery of the fractals named after him and Adrien Douady explains the solved and unsolved problems relating to this amusingly complex set.",

        "Description": "No matter how much you know, no matter how much you think, no matter how much you plot and you connive and you plan, you\u2019re not superior to sex.  With these words our most unflaggingly energetic and morally serious novelist launches perhaps his fiercest book.  The speaker is David Kepesh, white-haired and over sixty, an eminent cultural critic and star lecturer at a New York college\u2013as well as an articulate propagandist of the sexual revolution. For years he has made a practice of sleeping with adventurous female students while maintaining an aesthete\u2019s critical distance. But now that distance has been annihilated.   The agency of Kepesh\u2019s undoing is Consuela Castillo, the decorous and humblingly beautiful 24-year-old daughter of Cuban exiles. When he becomes involved with her, Kepesh finds himself dragged\u2013helplessly, bitterly, furiously\u2013into the quagmire of sexual jealousy and loss. In chronicling this descent, Philip Roth performs a breathtaking set of variations on the themes of eros and mortality, license and repression, selfishness and sacrifice. The Dying Animal is a burning coal of a book, filled with intellectual heat and not a little danger.",

And for the millions of vegetarians looking for simple, hearty fare, this book introduces them to the magic of slow cooking.Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker proves that slow cookers can be used for much more than just tough, inexpensive cuts of meat. They are perfect for vegetarian and healthy cooking because slow cooking is a foolproof way to make beans, grains, and root vegetables, in preparations such as Spicy White Bean and Sweet Potato Stew with Collards, Balsamic-Glazed Carrots and Parsnips, and Boston Brown Bread. Stuffed vegetables, such as Bell Peppers Stuffed with Couscous and Lentils, are moist and tender, with none of the oven\u2019s dryness. Even desserts, such as Chocolate Fantasy Fondue and Brandy-Laced Pear Brown Betty, are sensational.Chapters on appetizers, soups, stews, beans, vegetables, condiments, breakfasts, desserts, and beverages ensure that nothing is overlooked. A complete introduction provides information on all the latest advances in slow cooker models and accessories. By now the remarkable convenience of the slow cooker is no secret: it\u2019s practically a miracle to come home after a long day out and have dinner ready and waiting. It can be left unattended; it keeps the kitchen cool on warm days; and it\u2019s inexpensive and durable. At last, vegetarians and anyone looking for healthy meal alternatives can take full advantage of this amazing appliance.",

        "Description": "On Friday, May 11, 2001, the world mourned the untimely passing of Douglas Adams, beloved creator of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, dead of a heart attack at age forty-nine.  Thankfully, in addition to a magnificent literary legacy\u2014which includes seven novels and three co-authored works of nonfiction\u2014Douglas left us something more. The book you are about to enjoy was rescued from his four computers, culled from an archive of chapters from his long-awaited novel-in-progress, as well as his short stories, speeches, articles, interviews, and letters. In a way that none of his previous books could, The Salmon of Doubt provides the full, dazzling, laugh-out-loud experience of a journey through the galaxy as perceived by Douglas Adams. From a boy\u2019s first love letter (to his favorite science fiction magazine) to the distinction of possessing a nose of heroic proportions; from climbing Kilimanjaro in a rhino costume to explaining why Americans can\u2019t make a decent cup of tea; from lyrical tributes to the sublime pleasures found in music by Procol Harum, the Beatles, and Bach to the follies of his hopeless infatuation with technology; from fantastic, fictional forays into the private life of Genghis Khan to extended visits with Dirk Gently and Zaphod Beeblebrox: this is the vista from the elevated perch of one of the tallest, funniest, most brilliant, and most penetrating social critics and thinkers of our time.Welcome to the wonderful mind of Douglas Adams.",

In \"Ghosts\", Osvald Alving returns home only to discover the truth about the father he always looked up to, and learns the horrific effect his father's debauchery has had on him. It was Ibsen's most provocative drama, stripping away the surface of a middle-class family to expose layers of hypocrisy and immorality. \"A Public Enemy\" sets two brothers against each other when one wishes to make public the facts about the polluted water in the public baths of their home town. And \"When We Dead Wake\" tells of an artist meeting an old lover by chance and rejecting his wife, in a symbolic exploration of Ibsen's own literary life and the sacrifices he made in his work.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Barrow's Pi in the Sky is a profound -- and profoundly different -- exploration of the world of mathematics: where it comes from, what it is, and where it's going to take us if we follow it to the limit in our search for the ultimate meaning of the universe. Barrow begins by investigating whether math is a purely human invention inspired by our practical needs. Or is it something inherent in nature waiting to be discovered?In answering these questions, Barrow provides a bridge between the usually irreconcilable worlds of mathematics and theology. Along the way, he treats us to a history of counting all over the world, from Egyptian hieroglyphics to logical friction, from number mysticism to Marxist mathematics. And he introduces us to a host of peculiar individuals who have thought some of the deepest and strangest thoughts that human minds have ever thought, from Lao-Tse to Robert Pirsig, Charles Darwin, and Umberto Eco. Barrow thus provides the historical framework and the intellectual tools necessary to an understanding of some of today's weightiest mathematical concepts.",

        "Title": "His Excellency: George Washington",
        "Authors": "By Ellis, Joseph J.",
        "Description": "The author of seven highly acclaimed books, Joseph J. Ellis has crafted a landmark biography that brings to life in all his complexity the most important and perhaps least understood figure in American history, George Washington. With his careful attention to detail and his lyrical prose, Ellis has set a new standard for biography.Drawing from the newly catalogued Washington papers at the University of Virginia, Joseph Ellis paints a full portrait of George Washington\u2019s life and career\u2013from his military years through his two terms as president. Ellis illuminates the difficulties the first executive confronted as he worked to keep the emerging country united in the face of adversarial factions. He richly details Washington\u2019s private life and illustrates the ways in which it influenced his public persona. Through Ellis\u2019s artful narration, we look  inside Washington\u2019s marriage and his subsequent entrance into the upper echelons of Virginia\u2019s plantation society. We come to understand that it was by managing his own  large debts to British merchants that he experienced firsthand the imperiousness of the British Empire. And we watch the evolution of his attitude toward slavery, which led to his emancipating his own slaves in his will. Throughout, Ellis peels back the layers of myth and uncovers for us Washington in the context of eighteenth-century America, allowing us to comprehend the magnitude of his accomplishments and the character of his spirit and mind.When Washington died in 1799, Ellis tells us, he was eulogized as \u201cfirst in the hearts of his countrymen.\u201d Since then, however, his image has been chisled onto Mount Rushmore and printed on the dollar bill. He is on our landscape and in our wallets but not, Ellis argues, in our hearts. Ellis strips away the ivy and legend that have grown up over the Washington statue and recovers the flesh-and-blood man in all his passionate and fully human prowess.In the pantheon of our republic\u2019s founders, there were many outstanding individuals. And yet each of them\u2013Franklin, Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison\u2013 acknowledged Washington to be his superior, the only indispensable figure, the one and only \u201cHis Excellency.\u201d Both physically and politically, Washington towered over his peers for reasons this book elucidates. His Excellency is a full, glorious, and multifaceted portrait of the man behind our country\u2019s genesis, sure to become the authoritative biography of George Washington for many decades.",

        "Title": "Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill : A Call to Action Against TV, Movie and Video Game Violence",
        "Authors": "By Grossman, Dave and Degaetano, Gloria",
        "Description": "There is perhaps no bigger or more important issue in America at present than youth violence. Jonesboro; Paducah; Pearl, Mississippi; Stamps, Arkansas; Conyers, Georgia; and, of course, Littleton, Colorado. We know them all too well, and for all the wrong reasons: kids, some as young as eleven years old, taking up arms and, with deadly, frightening accuracy, murdering anyone in their paths. What is going on? According to the authors of Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill , there is blame to be laid right at the feet of the makers of violent video games (called 'murder trainers' by one expert), the TV networks, and the Hollywood movie studios--the people responsible for the fact that children witness literally thousands of violent images a day. Authors Lt. Col. Dave Grossman and Gloria DeGaetano offer incontrovertible evidence, much of it based on recent major scientific studies and empirical research, that movies, TV, and video games are not just conditioning children to be violent--and unaware of the consequences of that violence--but are teaching the very mechanics of killing. Their book is a much-needed call to action for every parent, teacher, and citizen to help our children and stop the wave of killing and violence gripping America's youth. And, most important, it is a blueprint for us all on how that can be achieved. In Paducah, Kentucky, Michael Carneal, a fourteen-year-old boy who stole a gun from a neighbor's house, brought it to school and fired eight shots at a student prayer group as they were breaking up. Prior to this event, he had never shot a real gun before. Of the eight shots he fired, he had eight hits on eight different kids. Five were head shots, the other three upper torso. The result was three dead, one paralyzed for life. The FBI says that the average, experienced, qualified law enforcement officer, in the average shootout, at an average range of seven yards, hits with less than one bullet in five. How does a child acquire such killing ability? What would lead him to go out and commit such a horrific act?",
