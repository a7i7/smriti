The voices speak of a plot to murder a wife who has failed to produce a child and whose family has failed to produce the promised dowry.  .  .       Megha is sick with horror when she realizes she is the intended victim. Her husband--the very man who tied the sacred necklace of marriage around her neck--and his mother are plotting to kill her! In the moment of panic, she runs for her life. Frantically racing through Palgaum's deserted streets, her way lit only by the lights strung up for the Diwali festival, her single goal is to escape death by fire. But fleeing from her would-be killers seems impossible--unless she can find someone to help her.  .  .      To approach her best friend would bring scandal to an innocent woman's doorstep, and turning to her own strict, conservative family is out of the question. Instead, with nothing but the sari she wears and a memory of kindness, Megha finds her way to Kiran, the one man who has shown her friendship and respect. Hiding her in his apartment, Kiran becomes her protector. But the forbidden attraction that grows between them can only bring more danger.  .  .    Caught between tradition and the truths buried in her heart, a dowry bride will discover the real cost of the only things worth having in life.  .  .    \"Packed with detail.  .  .splendidly depicts passion, brutality, and cultures in conflict.\"  --Dorothy Garlock",

        "Description": "Man and Superman and Three Other Plays, by George Bernard Shaw, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics\u00a0series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.\u00a0Acclaimed as a \u201csecond Shakespeare,\u201d Irish-born George Bernard Shaw revolutionized the British theater. Although his plays focus on ideas and issues, they are enlivened by fascinating characters, a brilliant command of language, and dazzling wit. One of Shaw\u2019s finest and most devilish comedies, Man and Superman portrays Don Juan as the quarry instead of the huntsman. John Tanner, upon discovering that his beautiful ward plans to marry him, flees to the Sierra Nevada mountain range, where he is captured by a group of rebels. Tanner falls asleep, and dreams the famous \u201cDon Juan in Hell\u201d sequence, which features a sparkling Shavian debate among Don Juan, the Devil, and a talkative statue. With its fairy-tale ending and a cast literally from hell, Man and Superman is a hilarious cocktail of farce, Nietzschean philosophy, and Mozart\u2019s Don Giovanni. Also included in this volume are Candida, Shaw\u2019s first real success on the stage, Mrs. Warren\u2019s Profession, which poked fun at the Victorian attitude toward prostitution, and The Devil\u2019s Disciple, a play set during the American Revolution.John A. Bertolini is Ellis Professor of the Liberal Arts at Middlebury College, where he teaches dramatic literature, Shakespeare, and film. He has written The Playwrighting Self of Bernard Shaw and articles on Hitchcock and on British and American dramatists. Bertolini also wrote the introduction and notes to the Barnes & Noble Classics edition of Shaw\u2019s Pygmalion and Three Other Plays.",

        "Description": "Writers and publishers depend on one another, but it often seems as if they speak two different languages. Getting It Published is a lively, insider's guide to academic publishing--a book that will tell you not only how publishing works, but how you can make it work for you. Written by a veteran editor with experience in both the university press and commercial worlds, the book fields the big questions in a scholar's life. Why do editors choose some books and decline others? How does a writer decide where to submit a project? How does the review process work, and why is it necessary? What can an author expect from a publishing house--before, during, and after publication? William Germano answers these questions and more, and along the way, offers encouragement, tips, and warnings.This savvy guide unravels the mysteries of publishing and walks you through the process from start to finish. You'll learn how to think about your book before you submit it and what you need to know about your contract. With wit and humor, Germano also addresses some of the finer points of publishing etiquette, including how--and how not--to approach a busy editor and how to work with other publishing professionals on matters of design, marketing, and publicity. Graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, and experienced authors alike will appreciate the chapters on \"Quotations, Pictures, and Other Headaches\" and on compiling and editing collections and anthologies. \"Scholarly publishing is a big, noisy, conversation about the ideas that shape our world,\" Germano writes, \"Here's how to make your book part of that conversation.\"",

        "Description": "With a landmass larger than the continental U.S. west of the Mississippi and the richest diversity of plant and animal species on earth, the Amazon has always struck its explorers and would-be exploiters as infinite and largely impenetrable. For decades, anthropologists assumed that permanent human habitation was impossible\u2013but they were wrong. Recently, proof of centuries-old Amazonian civilizations has been unearthed, shifting perceptions of the inhospitability of the rain forest\u2013and providing a precedent for human occupation. Today, as developers and environmentalists clash over the region\u2019s future, the seemingly endless forest is fast disappearing in fires, rampant mineral extraction, rogue logging operations, and encroaching urban sprawl. Through a series of startling human encounters\u2013interviews with government ministers and environmental crusaders, millionaire ranchers and disenfranchised slum dwellers\u2013Mark London and Brian Kelly, longtime explorers and trailblazing chroniclers of the Amazon basin, trace the region\u2019s transformation. Logging thousands of miles, London and Kelly take readers from the mushrooming shopping malls of Manaus to the pristine rain forest that still seems beyond the reach of civilization, from the ghostly ruins of abandoned factories and failed plantations to the thriving agribusinesses that one day may feed the entire world and change this landscape forever. Again and again, they collide with the same fundamental question: Is it too late to strike a balance in the Amazon between economic sustenance for the twenty-one million Brazilians who live there and protection for the world\u2019s last great forest? London and Brian Kelly have fashioned a complex, vibrant portrait of a region on the edge of crisis. At once a seductive journey and a searing account of political, environmental, and social tumult, The Last Forest is a masterpiece of contemporary reporting.",

Like Thelma herself, this book will reach out and hug you whenever you most need a heaping dose of comfort.Kick your shoes off, settle back, and unwind. Or give this book to someone you know who would enjoy a chuckle, a reflective pause, an 'Aha!' moment, maybe even a tear. Insights and encouragement lie within--and more than a few grins!",

        "Description": "Simple and perfect, macaroni and cheese is the ultimate comfort food, a classic dish that's reassuring and familiar, yet, with the addition of a bit of truffle oil or salsa, it kicks into high gear with an unexpected burst of flavor. Now, for the first time in one collection, dozens of well-known chefs, including Bobby Flay, Rocco DiSpirito, Charlie Palmer, David Burke, Matthew Kenney, Katy Sparks, and Rick Bayless, share favorite recipes, from both their childhood memories and their award-winning restaurants. Here are recipes for Macaroni with Wisconsin Asi-ago, Baked Four-Cheese Pasta, Penne with Roquefort, Macaroni and Cheese Croquettes, Green Chile Mac and Cheese, and Chunks of Lobster Swimming in Cheesy Macaroni. While the basic concept of pasta and cheese remains the same, each recipe has its own taste and personality, blending and balancing flavor, texture, and presentation for a bold Mac and Cheese experience.Simple enough for the novice cook yet sophisticated enough to impress the experienced home chef, Macaroni and Cheese is a fun-filled cookbook that will be enjoyed for years to come.",

Messy Spirituality was written for the silent majority of us who have been convinced that we just don\u2019t do Christianity right. We spend most of our lives worried about what we don\u2019t do instead of what we have done, focused on our imperfections instead of God\u2019s fondness for the imperfect. Why? Because we\u2019ve been bombarded with books, tapes, talks, seminars, and movies convincing us that real Christianity is all about perfection.Michael Yaconelli dares to suggest that imperfection, infiniteness, and messiness are, in fact, the earmarks of true Christianity; that real Christianity is messy, erratic, lopsided . . . and gloriously liberating.  What if genuine faith begins with admitting we will never have our act completely together? Maybe messy disciples are exactly the kind of imperfect people Jesus came to earth for and whose company he actually enjoyed--and still enjoys. If you want to find Jesus today, look for him in the midst of burned-out believers, moral misfits, religious incompetents . . . men and women whose lives are, well, messy. Messy Spirituality is a strong antidote for the spiritual perfectionism in us all. Here are truths that can cut you loose from the tyranny of ought-to\u2019s and open your eyes to the deep spirituality of being loved, shortcomings and all, by the God who meets you and transforms you in the midst of a messy and unpredictable life.",

Inspired by the example of American freedom and justice, a movement in Franconia among the peasants, who have revolted several times even before the arrival from the future of the town of Grantville, an independent revolutionary movement has arisen, flying the banner of the head of a ram. The West Virginians fully approve of liberating the peasants from the nobility, but they are also aware of how revolutionary movements can lead to bloodbaths. And avoiding that deadly possibility will require all of their future knowledge and all their plain old American horse-trading diplomacy. . . .",

Born with a desire to explore the world beyond her borders, Elena finds her passion in the complexity of the English language\u2014but in the Soviet Union of the 1960s such a passion verges on the subversive. Elena is controlled by the state the same way she is controlled by her mother, a mirror image of her motherland: overbearing, protective, difficult to leave. In the battle between a strong-willed daughter and her authoritarian mother, the daughter, in the end, must break free and leave in order to survive.Through Elena\u2019s captivating voice, we learn not only the stories of Russian family life in the second half of the twentieth century, but also the story of one rebellious citizen whose curiosity and determination finally transport her to a new world. It is an elegy to the lost country of childhood, where those who leave can never return.",
