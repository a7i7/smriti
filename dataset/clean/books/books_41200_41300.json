A woman told an intriguing story about a girl named Nell Ryder, granddaughter to the owner of the Ryder Stud Farm in Cambridgeshire, who went missing more than a year before and has never been found.

Together with Jury, Nell's family, and the Cambridgeshire police, Plant embarks on a search to find Nell and bring her home. But is there more to their mission than just restoring a fifteen-year-old girl to her family?The Grave Maurice is the eighteenth entry in the Richard Jury series and, from its pastoral opening to its calamitous end, is full of the same suspense and humor that devoted readers expect from Martha Grimes.",

        "Description": "For more than a century, the National Geographic Society's illustrators have taken readers to places beyond the reach of the camera's lens, on extraordinary journeys of the imagination, to destinations that can be seen only through the artist's eye. With vivid colors and subtle brush strokes, they have led us back to the birth of our planet and forward to the colonization of space. They have laid out before our wondering eyes the enigmatic faces of our earliest ancestors and the rich mysteries of the natural world.  Selected from the more than 12,000 illustrations in the National Geographic archives, the 156 stunning images reproduced in this book make up the first comprehensive exhibition of this important collection of artwork. The 65 illustrators represented include such widely known artists as N.C. Wyeth, Andrew Wyeth, James Gurney, Syd Mead, and three-time Caldecott Award-winner Jerry Pinkney, as well as many others whose unmistakable styles are known to National Geographic readers worldwide. The Art of National Geographic explores science and nature, humankind's accomplishments and conflicts, and all the wonders of the universe in a wide variety of media, from oil paint and watercolor to cutting-edge computer graphics. In his salutary foreword, renowned scientist and author Stephen Jay Gould confirms the continuing importance of illustration to scientific investigation. In the book's lively and informative text, Alice A. Carter, an award-winning illustrator herself, reveals as much about the behind-the-scenes adventure of creating this art, and the science behind it, as it does about the artists themselves.  For art lovers, armchair explorers, history and science buffs alike, The Art of National Geographic is at once a glorious visual treasury and an invaluable reference, a sweeping excursion through our world and our achievements, and a fascinating history of the National Geographic Society's century-long commitment to outstanding illustration.",

        "Authors": "By Provenzo, Eugene F. and Provenzo, Asterie Baker",
        "Description": "Here is a highly motivating book for grade-school students that will introduce them to many of the world's most popular (and historically significant) scientific experiments. They'll learn about gravity simply by following the acrobatic antics of an ordinary coin. By trying to blow an egg out of a cup, they'll discover the principles of air pressure. Dancing soap bubbles will help them understand the effects of static electricity, and by dropping quarters into a full glass of water without causing it to overflow, they'll study the effects of surface tension.These and over 40 other experiments have been carefully selected by noted educators Eugene and Asterie Baker Provenzo to familiarize children with classic science experiments involving optics, inertia, air pressure, magnetism, sound, topology, light, density, vibration, prisms, elasticity, gases, vacuum, perspective, geometry, centrifugal force, buoyancy, color, and much more. Some experiments, such as the optical \"Newton's Rings\" are hundreds of years old. Still others, like the straw lever test, are based on Greek experiments with leverage and the center of gravity \u2014 first carried out thousands of years ago.Easy-to-follow instructions and illustrations show youngsters how to perform each experiment, most of which are prefaced with historical background, a list of necessary materials and an explanation of key terms. Almost all experiments can be carried out with common household items (tissue paper, scissors, tapes, rubber balloons, pens, pencils, etc.) and can be worked at home or in the classroom to demonstrate specific scientific principles or to supplement a science-curriculum unit. Sources for all historical illustrations given in the text are listed at the end of the book.",

        "Description": "For 6,000 years, irrigation has ranked among the most powerful tools of human advancement. The story of settled agriculture, the growth of cities, and the rise of early empires is, to no small degree, a story of controlling water to make the land more prosperous and habitable. Pillar of Sand examines the history, challenges, and pitfalls of irrigated agriculture \u2014 from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia to twentieth-century India and the United States. By unmasking the risks faced by irrigation-based societies \u2014 including water scarcity, soil salinization, and conflicts over rivers \u2014 water specialist Sandra Postel connects the lessons of the past with the challenge of making irrigation thrive into the twenty-first century and beyond. Protecting rivers and vital ecosystems as the world aims to feed 8 billion people will require a doubling of water productivity \u2014 getting twice as much benefit from each gallon removed from rivers, lakes, and aquifers. Pillar of Sand points the way toward managing the growing competition for scarce water. And it lays out a strategy for correcting a startling flaw of the modern irrigation age \u2014 its failure to better the lives of the majority of the world's poorest farmers.",

        "Authors": "By Kidd, Sue Monk",
        "Description": "The\u00a0New York Times'bestselling second book by the author of\u00a0The Secret Life of Bees\u00a0and the forthcoming novel\u00a0The Book of Longings \u00a0 Inside the church of a Benedictine monastery on Egret Island, just off the coast of South Carolina, resides a beautiful and mysterious chair ornately carved with mermaids and dedicated to a saint who, legend claims, was a mermaid before her conversion. When Jessie Sullivan is summoned home to the island to cope with her eccentric mother's seemingly inexplicable behavior, she is living a conventional life with her husband, Hugh, a life 'molded to the smallest space possible.' Jessie loves Hugh, but once on the island, she finds herself drawn to Brother Thomas, a monk about to take his final vows. Amid a rich community of unforgettable island women and the exotic beauty of marshlands, tidal creeks, and majestic egrets, Jessie grapples with the tension of desire and the struggle to deny it, with a freedom that feels overwhelmingly right and the immutable force of home and marriage. Is the power of the mermaid chair only a myth? Or will it alter the course of Jessie's life? What happens will unlock the roots of her mother's tormented past, but most of all, it will allow Jessie to comes discover selfhood and a place of belonging as she explores the thin line between the spiritual and the erotic.",
