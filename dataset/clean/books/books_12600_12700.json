For anyone who has ever felt frazzled, stressed, confused, hurt, angry, undone, or any other emotional response to the difficulties and uncertainties of life, Stan Toler serves up a delightful combination of poignant-and hilarious-reminders that God is still at work in the world. And He is 100% faithful! No wonder they can declare that pinto beans and fried bologna are a feast of faith. Because that's what a group of loving friends brought to Stan's home on a Christmas morning when he was five years old-and there was no food left in the house. No, God is never late! So when nothing seems to be happening in your life, something really is happening. Yes, it is possible to cope with life even if you don't know how to program a VCR. Yes, the God who sits on a throne in Heaven is interested in you right now!",

        "Description": "With the wit and charm and wit that have made him one of America's most beloved, and now most sorely missed, television personalities, Larry Sanders tells here the story behind the man -- Larry -- from his emotionally barren beginnings in Mound, Minnesota, to his ten-year run as the man millions went to bed with every night. (He had a very big bed.) Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host is a Hollywood autobiography like no other because it reveals all -- the loves and losses, the pain and joy, the shrinks and doctors -- and it is uproariously funny. Larry Sanders has written a book that will have the same ten-year run that his show did.  Larry Sanders is no ordinary man, and this book will show America and the world how very different he is. Fueled by an enormous need to be loved and gifted with a talent beyond even his own, Sanders has risen to the top of his field -- and dropped -- while retaining all of his dignity and modesty. As he says on the first page of his story, \"I'm famous. Actually, I'm very, very, very famous.\" Sanders's story is laced with the names (and some of the faces) of the thousands of celebrities who have sought his attention for a decade -- and Sanders tells the world what he thinks of all of them, even if it hurts his own feelings.  Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host is a Hollywood tell-all that will forever change the nature of this kind of book. While Geraldo Rivera used his sexual exploits to shamelessly promote his book, Sanders uses his conquests of thousands of women to illustrate his compassion and grace. \"If it sells, it sells,\" Sanders says. \"There was never a hidden agenda.\" While Roseanne used her book to promote her many personalities, Sanders's book shows how a straight-shooter can not only survive but thrive in Hollywood. Most of all, Sanders, in truthfully disclosing all aspects of his life and those of people he has never met, hopes to heal and entertain. Sanders has written a wonderfully hilarious book that will make some of his fans wish he were back.",

        "Title": "Breaking the Surface:",
        "Authors": "By Louganis, Greg and Marcus, Eric",
        "Description": "No one who watched the 1988 Olympics on television will ever forget seeing Greg Louganis hit his head on the diving board during the ninth dive of the springboard preliminaries. Millions felt his pain and then held their breath as the two-time gold medalist returned to the board only minutes later, with four stitches and a waterproof patch, and executed what was perhaps the best dive of the 1988 Olympics.People around the world knew they were witnessing a singular moment of extraordinary courage and perseverance. Many still remember the dramatic images of the days that followed: Greg's spectacular diving despite the patch and the stitches, Greg smiling as he tapped his heart to show how hard it was beating, Greg on the platform praying before his final dive, Greg winning his third and fourth gold medals, the very symbol of the Olympic spirit.At a team banquet after the diving was over, Greg thanked his coach, Ron O'Brien, saying, \"Nobody will ever know what we went through, nobody.\" And apart from O'Brien and a handful of people close to Louganis, nobody did know - until the publication of this book - that several months prior to the '88 Olympics, Greg had tested positive for HIV.Breaking the Surface is the unflinchingly honest story of a man breaking free of a lifetime of silence and isolation. Born to a young Samoan father and Northern European mother, adopted at nine months by Pete and Frances Louganis, Greg began performing at age three in local dance and acrobatic competitions. He started diving lessons at age nine, and at sixteen he won a silver medal at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. But despite his astonishing athletic skill and artistry on the diving board. Greg struggled with late-detected dyslexia, prejudice toward his dark skin coloring, and anguish over his sexual orientation, which he felt compelled to hide.Being in the spotlight intensified difficulties with personal relationships and substance abuse. Like many other elite athletes, Greg found that the highs that came with winning never compensated for the lows. But despite his demons and personal disappointments, he always conveyed a warmth and grace that people remembered long after the '88 Olympics.Greg returned to national prominence when he stepped forward at the 1994 Gay Games in New York City and then urged the U.S. Olympic Committee to move the 1996 volleyball preliminaries from the Georgia county that had passed a resolution condemning gay people.By speaking out at this time, Greg hopes to raise awareness about a number of key issues, including AIDS prevention and research and domestic violence. \"I'm doing it now,\" he says, \"because I want to tell my story in my own words while I still have the chance. I'm finally ready to tell my story. I hope you're ready to hear it.\"",

Like Joyce Cary's Art and Reality, this is a book by a writer on the issues raised by the art of literature. Readers of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek and Holy the Firm will recognize Dillard's vivid writing, her humor, and the lively way in which she tackles the urgent questions of meaning in experience itself.",

The mystery is not why Haycock was murdered - very few could stomach the woman-hating, power-hungry prof - but who did the deed. As Woody proceeds, she finds herself engulfed in a quagmire of infighting and deceit, literary allusions and overinflated egos. And it's time to call in the reinforcements.Enter Kate Fansler, professor and crime solver extraordinaire. Together, Woody and Kate start to pull at the loose ends of the very tangled Clifton College English Department. Woody's list of suspects is longer than the freshman survey reading list: Antonia Lansbury, the lone tenured woman on the staff - and thereby the target of Haycock's venomous, misogynistic ire; Professor David Longworth, weary of Haycock's controlling ways and now first in line for Department Chair; Rick Fowler, a professor forced out of Clifton because of his liberal views and out-and-proud principles; and Haycock's wife, who was about to file for divorce when her husband gasped his last breath.As Kate and Woody defuse the host of literary land mines set out for them, Woody suspects they're only scratching the surface of a very large and sinister plot. And it will take both women's expertise and cunning to solve the murder of a man no one was sorry to see go.",

        "Description": "Carved out, at the close of the eighteenth century, of some of the thickest woods and foulest swamps north of Georgia, the glorious city of Washington D.C., is among America's most stately, most beautiful, and most impressive.  Indeed, once maligned by Charles Dickens as simply \"spacious avenues that begin in nothing and lead nowhere; streets a mile long that only want houses, roads, and inhabitants; public buildings that need but a public to be complete, \" Washington, D.C. today is a powerful symbol not only of our nation but of democracy.Spanning the Potomac in majestic fashion, the city fans out gracefully, offering a multitude of pleasures to the more than twenty million tourists who visit annually.  From official Washington (the imposing Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, the White House, the Capitol, the souring obelisk of the Washington Monument) to its lush public parks and gardens; from Arlington National Cemetery to the Capitol reflecting pool; the Museum of Natural History's fabled elephant; the charm of its celebrated Cherry Blossom Festival to the somber beauty of the Vietnam Wall; from the massive FBI Building to the profoundly moving Holocaust Museum\u2014Washington D.C., A Pictorial Souvenir, a marvelously evocative portrait in words and pictures, captures this historic city memorably.A wonderful keepsake for anyone who has ever visited Washington, and an enticing gift for those who merely dream of strolling down Pennsylvania Avenue, America's \"Main Street,\" Washington D.C., A Pictorial Souvenir succeeds in conveying all the grandeur of the nation's capital while reminding us that this splendor belongs, of course, to all who prize democracy.",

        "Description": "Inspired by such visionary writers as M. Scott Peck and Max De Pree, authors Lee Bolman and Terry Deal have crafted a powerful story of one beleaguered executive's quest for passion and purpose in work and in life. This contemporary parable chronicles the journey of Steve, a dispirited leader in search of something deeper and more satisfying than a preoccupation with the bottom line. He seeks answers from Maria, a sage whose wisdom was forged in her own hard-won business career. Although Maria's initial questions seem far afield from business, Steve unexpectedly discovers the true meaning of leadership. By finding his own soul, he learns to ignite the spirit of his organization.The authors draw upon many of the world's major spiritual traditions, poetry and philosophy, social science teachings on leadership and organizations, and their own extensive consulting experience. They offer inspiration, guidance, and an invitation to participate with them in understanding the ties that bind spirituality and leadership together.",

It is far  and away the most comprehensive book ever written on sendmail, the program  that acts like a traffic cop in routing and delivering mail on Unix-based  networks. Although sendmail is used on almost every Unix system, it's one  of the last great uncharted territories--and most difficult utilities to  learn--in Unix system administration.This book provides a complete sendmail tutorial, plus extensive reference  material on every aspect of the program. What's more, it's authoritative,  having been coauthored by Eric Allman, the developer of sendmail. In  addition to Version 8.8, it covers earlier versions available on many  systems, such as those found on Sun workstations. Part One is a tutorial  on understanding sendmail; Part Two covers the building, installation, and  m4 configuration of sendmail; Part Three covers practical issues in sendmail  administration; Part Four is a comprehensive reference section; and Part  Five consists of appendixes and a bibliography.In this second edition an expanded tutorial demonstrates hub's cf file and nullclient.mc. Other topics include the #error delivery agent, sendmail's exit values, MIME headers, and how to set up and use the user database, mailertable, and smrsh. Solution-oriented examples  throughout the book help you solve your own sendmail problems. Plus, this  edition is cross-referenced with section numbers.",

Charles Kuralt is a national treasure, a reporter and man of the world who was to many the real and true voice of America. To several generations Kuralt was the Mark Twain of television, a wanderer transfixed by the richness and greatness that he found in practically every corner of the country. For more than thirty years, he delighted us with his On the Road reports, as anchor of CBS News Sunday Morning, and with bestselling books that include On the Road with Charles Kuralt and Charles Kuralt's America. As Time magazine wrote, he was \"the laureate of the common man.\"  The project that Kuralt was working on before he died was An American Moment with Charles Kuralt, a series of brief television essays about the people, places, and ideas that define the national spirit: the man who handcrafts the president's shoes; the Keeper of the Flame on Liberty Island; Paul Bunyan's hometown of Bemidji, Minnesota; the Pony Express Museum; cowboy hats; Ferris wheels; and more.  Kuralt's longtime friend and CBS colleague Peter Freundlich, who wrote and produced the American Moment series for television in collaboration with Kuralt, has edited and collected the essays for this book. The result is a collection of enchanting and sometimes touching stories that brings back Charles Kuralt's distinctive voice and celebrates the quintessential American character and traditions that he so loved.",

It is not uncommon to feel anger, frustration, grief, fear, and denial as you try to accept a new way of living. As you lose your ability to do things you once considered routine, you may even feel that you are losing your self-worth, that your physical condition is threatening your identity.

In Hartford, Connecticut, in the late 1940s, a set of twins is parted at birth-not by accident. Nat Cartwright goes home with his parents, a schoolteacher and an insurance salesman, while his twin brother begins his days as Fletcher Davenport, son of a millionaire and his society wife. During the 1950s and 1960s, the two brothers grow up apart, following similar paths that take them in different directions. Nat leaves college at the University of Connecticut to serve in Vietnam, then finishes school, earns his MBA, and becomes a successful currency dealer. Fletcher, meanwhile, graduates from Yale University with a bachelor's and a law degree, going on to distinguish himself as a criminal defense lawyer. At various times in their lives, both men are confronted with challenges and obstacles, tragedy and betrayal, loss and hardship, before they both decide to run for governor, unaware they are brothers.... In the tradition of Jeffrey Archer's most popular books, Sons of Fortune is as much a chronicle of a nation in transition as it is the story of the making of these two men -and how they eventually discover the truth-and its tragic consequences.",

Citing his own studies, he investigates the reasons for variable sleep patterns and finds that sleep requirements are influenced by differences in personality, as well as age, life style, and mental state. He then explores the effects on sleep of psychological stress, physical and intellectual activity, and the use of drugs and of other chemicals. The different kinds of tiredness and the role of dreaming in sleep function are also studied. Written clearly enough for the layman to understand, this book is nevertheless a sophisticated theoretical contribution to the literature on sleep. Hartmann combines the rigor of the laboratory scientist with the sensitivity of the clinician. His conclusions offer some fascinating controversial notes on the relationship between the brain and the mind.",

Only a few, like the boll weevil, the zebra mussel, and the infamously invasive kudzu, have penetrated the public consciousness, but hundreds of other exotics are spreading like wildfire across the land. These aliens have already transformed our landscapes, depleted our biological diversity, and cost us billions of dollars. They need to be brought under control.  \"We can't afford to keep ignoring or underestimating the invasion,\" writes Robert Devine as he takes the measure of this extraordinary ecological assault, explaining where alien species come from, how they establish their beachheads and expand, why they seem so much hardier than the indigenous species they displace, and what we can do to neutralize them. A fascinating and informative book that ranges from Hawaii to Florida, Alien Invasion combines state-of-the-art environmental science with vivid personal stories of the impact of exotics, from a firefighter's gripping tale of a fatal cheatgrass blaze to an eerie boat ride through an Everglades grove where all other life has been choked out by a foreign tree.",

        "Title": "Forbidden Fruit: The True Story of My Secret Love Affair With Ireland's Most Powerful Bishop",
        "Authors": "By Murphy, Annie",
        "Description": "After eighteen years of secrecy, culminating in one of the greatest scandals ever to befall the Catholic Church, here at last is the true - and the only authorized - account of Annie Murphy and her love affair with Eamonn Casey, Bishop of Galway, Ireland. Romantic, spellbinding, and often shocking, the haunting passion of this profound love story is quite simply unforgettable and rivals any in recent fiction.Annie Murphy came to Ireland from the United States in 1973 after the breakup of a turbulent marriage. She made the trip hoping to find spiritual peace under the guidance of a distant cousin, Eamonn Casey, then Bishop of Kerry. Instead, she found a charming, dynamic man - and the attraction was immediate and mutual. Within weeks the two were lovers, caught up in a whirlwind romance at Casey's hilltop retreat on the Atlantic coast.Fifteen months after Annie's arrival, she and Eamonn became parents. But sadly for Annie, the love Eamonn felt for her - and the Church - did not extend to his son, Peter. Fearing scandal, the Bishop did everything possible to force Annie to give Peter up for adoption - and even went so far as to interfere with her medical attention when she developed a life-threatening infection after the birth. When Annie resisted and returned to America to raise her child alone, the Bishop did his best to cover up Peter's existence, shunning contact with his secret family and providing only sporadic financial support.Despite Casey's efforts, however, knowledge of Peter - and the Bishop's affair with Annie Murphy - could not remain a secret forever. In May of 1992, Annie and the son the Bishop tried so desperately to hide went public and forced Casey to acknowledge the truth. The disclosure caused Casey, the Bishop of Galway, to resign from his diocese - and added fuel to the ongoing debate over the Church's positions on celibacy, birth control, abortion, and the role of the clergy.Forbidden Fruit is an astonishing and unique story of a union so powerful it rocked the foundations of the Catholic Church. Replete with intrigue, drama, and breathtaking emotion, it is ultimately a story not only of deception and denial but, most important, of love and forgiveness. For despite all the controversy, the extraordinary passion between Annie Murphy and the Bishop of Galway blazed so brightly that it still reverberates through both their lives, all these years later.",

        "Description": "Welcome to the world of cutting-edge math, physics, and neuroscience, where the search for the ultimate vacuum, the point of nothingness, ground zero of theory, has rendered the universe deep, rich, and juicy. \"Modern physics has animated the void,\" says K. C. Cole in her entrancing journey into the heart of Nothing. Every time scientists and mathematicians think they have reached the ultimate void, new stuff appears: a black hole, an undulating string, an additional dimension of space or time, repulsive anti-gravity, universes that breed like bunnies. Cole's exploration at the edge of everything is as animated and exciting as the void itself. Take Cole's hand on this adventure into the unknown, and you'll come back informed, amused, and excited.",

        "Title": "Wiesenthal File, The",
        "Authors": "By Levy, Alan",
        "Description": "Simon Wiesenthal spent four and a half years in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. Eighty-nine family members and relatives were exterminated, and he himself ended the war a living skeleton. Almost fifty years later, Wiesenthal remains undauntedly committed to the cause of justice for the Jewish people and to the pursuit of Nazi war criminals. The cases he has pursued are many - he has brought eleven hundred Nazis to trial - and his name has frequently hit world headlines in connection with such figures as Adolf Eichmann, Franz Stangl, Josef Mengele, and Kurt Waldheim.Of his enormous personal courage there is no doubt. But so long after the war, is Wiesenthal's work still important? Does it have meaning? Is he making a positive contribution to post-Holocaust Judaism? Wiesenthal's answer is resolute: \"We live in a modern world. We know there is pollution. The air is bad, the water is bad, the skies are dirty. But there is another sort of pollution that people ignore. In many countries people are living between murderers, and that is the biggest pollution of all.\"This book by internationally known author and journalist Alan Levy - an acquaintance of Wiesenthal for many years - is the first critical examination of Wiesenthal's life and work. The story of Wiesenthal's pursuit of war criminals - often detailed in Wiesenthal's own words - offers reading as exciting as any thriller. But The Wiesenthal File is much more than that. It is an examination by an independent-minded Jew of the work of one of the greatest Jewish figures of our century.",

        "Title": "This Noble Land:: My Vision for America",
        "Authors": "By Michener, James A.",
        "Description": "Deteriorating race relations, a growing disparity between rich and poor, the decline of education and a growing anti-intellectualism, inadequate health care - these are among the fracture points that Mr. Michener believes threaten America's vitality and its future. As a scholar of world history, a dedicated, lifelong public servant, and a student of his own and other cultures, Michener offers a broad and learned perspective on these much debated issues. He compares America's shift from a producer to a consumer nation to a similar movement in sixteenth-century Spain - a movement that presaged the decline of the Spanish empire. In today's control of vast wealth by a tiny handful of people, he sees parallels with the Catholic Church's monopoly on wealth in pre-Reformation Europe. He evaluates the Contract with America and other current political initiatives in light of the Founding Fathers' understanding of the social contract and the responsibility the more fortunate have to those who are less privileged. And as a lifelong practitioner and patron of the arts, Michener writes movingly of the arts as agents for change - for transforming the soul and ensuring a civilization's greatness - even as he condemns the anti-art stance of many politicians today.Michener draws not only on his knowledge of history but also on over eight decades of living as an American. He recalls how as a young boy in a Pennsylvania schoolhouse he pledged allegiance to the flag, and through the years his reverence for the sound principles on which America was founded has remained strong. Through the trials of young manhood during the Great Depression and the Second World War, and through the decades since, James Michener has been deeply involved in America's political life. He has experienced and studied the qualities that have made America what he calls \"the outstanding success\" among nations, and in his wise, opinionated, and impassioned book he calls on Americans to hold fast to America's sound historical standards and principles as we struggle to solve today's crises and to meet the challenges of tomorrow.",

        "Title": "Life Strategies",
        "Authors": "By McGraw, Phillip C., Ph.D.",
        "Description": "Some people spend their lives reacting to what life hands them, while others craft life to fit their goals. Author Phillip C. McGraw, who is a psychologist but describes himself as a strategist, is determined to make sure that his readers are the creators of their lives, not created by their lives. By accepting that you are personally accountable for every element of your life, McGraw says, you can erase the negative \"epidemic behaviors\" (found in all of American society: denial, false assumptions, inertia, deceptive masking) in your life and reach your goals.Written in a tough-love, sometimes cantankerous tone, this self-help book is not for those looking to explore their inner child or visualize away negative energy. No, this is pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps advice from someone who's done just that. McGraw opens with a scene describing how he helped Oprah Winfrey survive--and win--the 1998 \"Mad Cow\" lawsuit in Texas, when she was having difficulty coping with the reality of what was happening to her. He helped her face the facts about the lawsuit, after which she was better able to participate in crafting a strategy to win it. McGraw first forces you to take a good hard look at who you are by dissecting your personality. It may be painful to realize that you fall into the \"Porcupine\" or \"Perfecto\" or any of the other personality types McGraw delineates, but here it's true that there's no gain without pain, because (Life Law No. 4) \"You Can't Change What You Don't Acknowledge.\" He then describes in depth all 10 \"Life Laws\"--the rules by which the world plays--that he learned the hard way. Laws such as \"You Either Get It, or You Don't,\" \"Life Is Managed; It Is Not Cured,\" and \"You Have to Name It to Claim It\" make up the bulk of the book and McGraw's realist philosophy. If you learn and abide by the Life Laws and go on to create a Life Strategy, McGraw claims you will not only know yourself better and eliminate negative behaviors, you will also know how to reach any goal you set for yourself. --Stefanie Durbin",
