        "Title": "After the Soviet Union: From Empire to Nations (American Assembly Series)",
        "Authors": "By Legvold, Robert (EDT), Colton, Timothy J. (EDT), and Legyold, Robert (EDT)",
        "Description": "The failed coup by Communist hardliners in Moscow in August 1991 marked the inevitable disintegration of the Soviet Union. No single event since the end of World War II will have more far-reaching effects. The power struggles now underway in the fifteen successor republics raise the specter of chaos in Eastern Europe and Southern Asia. Can these new nations manage their deepening economic crisis? What political form will the new republics take, and can the changes be accomplished peacefully? What dangers and problems does the Soviet Union's passage present to the outside world?This collection of original essays, sponsored by the Harriman Institute at Columbia University and the American Assembly, is the first comprehensive assessment of the challenges facing the Soviet Union's successor republics. In five concise chapters, leading American scholars of Soviet affairs examine the economics, politics, and foreign policy of the new nations. The future role of the Soviet military machine - really another nation among the nations - is also discussed. The authors' conclusions lend ground for a tempered optimism about the future of the former USSR.",

Slacker moms say \"No\" to parenting philosophies that undermine parents'-and children's-ability to think for themselves. They say \"Yes\" to saving their money and time by opting out of the parenting competition. And they say \"Hell, Yes!\" to having a life of their own, knowing it makes them better parents.In this witty and insightful book, author Muffy Mead-Ferro reflects on her experience of growing up on a ranch in Wyoming, where parenting-by necessity-was more hands-off, people \"made do\" with what they had, and common sense and generational wisdom prevailed. We should all take her sane lead!",

From then on, she will drink faithfully, fanatically. In high school, her experimentation will lead to a stomach pumping. In college, her excess will give way to a pattern of self-poisoning that will grow more destructive each year. At age twenty-two, Zailckas will wake up in an unfamiliar apartment in New York City, elbow her friend who is passed out next to her, and ask, \"Where are we?\"Smashed is a sober look at how she got there and, after years of blackouts and smashups, what it took for her to realize she had to stop drinking.

Superbly illustrated in full color, Mammoths features scores of photographs of mammoth remains, cave art, and prehistoric carvings made of mammoth ivory - along with fifteen dramatic reconstructions depicting how mammoths lived and how humans responded to their presence.Here, then, is the history of the origins, life, and eventual demise of a creature that has long held a special, nearly mystical, place in the human imagination. As the mammoths come to life on these pages, so too do the environments in which they lived, along with other extinct mammals and our own prehistoric ancestors who drew and carved images of mammoths more than 30,000 years ago. Mammoths is at once an up-to-date study and a dazzling visual record of one of the Earth's most extraordinary species.",

        "Description": "Misery Loves Maggody  And you will too.  Murder and mayhem have never been so hilarious as in the sleepy little town of Maggody, Arkansas. Population 755. And in this newest entry to the Joan Hess series, there's twice the fun when some of Maggody's most beloved inhabitants venture out of state. Meanwhile, all manner of unrest also unfolds on the familiar Maggody home front.  When beleaguered chief of police Arly Hanks hears that her mother, Ruby Bee, and best friend, Estelle Oppers, are headed for Memphis on a four-day Elvis Pilgrimage, she thinks she may be getting a break that is long overdue. But before the \"pilgrims\" are past the airport on the way out of Faberville, the fur starts flying, and soon the trip is completely stalled by a variety of deadly doings. Estelle calls home to report that Ruby Bee has collapsed and is in the local hospital, and even before Arly's seen the delta dawn, one of the other clients on the tour is found dead beneath the eighth-floor balcony of the hotel. Worse still, the balcony from which she plunged turns out to be none other than the room of a prominent Maggody citizen, who has been hauled off to the local jail. What's more, Estelle's pretty darn sure the tour van is being followed by thugs in an ominous black car -- and another body's about to be laid to rest in Graceland.  Back home things aren't much better and certainly no quieter, so Arly Hanks will have to be at her most resourceful to restore the peace once again to the inhabitants of Maggody -- both those at home and those who have roamed beyond the town limits.  Variously described by critics as a \"rollicking tour de force\" (Boston Magazine), \"Bawdy entertainment\" (Kirkus Reviews), \"Hilarious\" (St. Louis Post-Dispatch), \"delectable and continually surprising\" (The New York Times Book Review), Joan Hess's Maggody series is one of a kind and just keeps getting better.",

When the young Queen Elizabeth I is entrusted with Anne Boleyn's secret diary, she discovers a great deal about the much-maligned mother she never knew. And on learning the truth about her lascivious and despotic father, Henry VIII, she vows never to relinquish control to any man. But this avowal doesn't prevent Elizabeth from pursuing a torrid love affair with her horsemaster, Robin Dudley -- described with near-shocking candor -- as too are Anne's graphic trysts with a very persistent and lustful Henry. Blending a historian's attention to accuracy with a novelist's artful rendering, Maxwell weaves compelling descriptions of court life and devastating portraits of actual people into her naughty, page-turning tale. The result is a masterpiece of historical fiction -- so prophetic of our time that one would think it were ripped from today's headlines.",

To that end she travels to some of America's most conspicuous places, like the presidential conventions of 1996, and some of its darkest corners, like a women's prison in Maryland. And along the way she interviews everyone from janitors to murderers to Bill Clinton himself.

But someone had taken advantage of that sweetness, leaving her dead in St. Mary Magdalene's churchyard, her ripped bodice testimony to her struggle, a bloodstained stone cross the solitary witness to her death.Justin de Quincy was the queen's man, working on behalf of Eleanor of Aquitaine. His duty was clear: to find her missing son, Richard Lionheart, and prevent Prince John from usurping Richard's throne. What had he to do with a commonplace murder, with the death of a poor man's child? But little by little, Justin comes to feel the force of the dead girl, perhaps even to love her as well, and he soon commits to finding her killer. But can he also bring him to justice?",

        "Description": "In eight Tuesdays each year, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan convenes a small committee to set the short-term interest rate that can move through the American and world economies like an electric jolt. As much as any, the committee's actions determine the economic well-being of every American. The availability of money for business or consumer loans, mortgages, job creation and overall national economic growth flows from those decisions. Perhaps the last Washington secret is how the Federal Reserve and its enigmatic chairman, Alan Greenspan, operate. In Maestro, Bob Woodward takes you inside the Fed and Greenspan's thinking. We listen to the Fed's internal debates as the American economy is pushed into a historic 10-year expansion while the world economy lurches from financial crisis to financial crisis. Greenspan plays a sometimes subtle, sometimes blunt behind-the-scenes role. He appears in Maestro up close as never before -- alternately nervous and calm, plunging into mathematics one moment and politics the next, skeptical, dispassionate, always struggling -- often alone.  Maestro traces a fascinating intellectual journey as Greenspan, an old-school anti-inflation hawk of the traditional economy, is among the first to realize the potential in the modern, high-productivity new economy -- the foundation of the current American boom. Woodward's account of the Greenspan years is a remarkable portrait of a man who has become the symbol of American economic preeminence.",

        "Description": "A lively and provocative look at the modern culture of motherhood and at the social, economic, and political forces that shaped current ideas about parenting     What is wrong with this picture? That's the question Judith Warner asks in this national bestseller after taking a good, hard look at the world of modern parenting--at anxious women at work and at home and in bed with unhappy husbands.     When Warner had her first child, she was living in Paris, where parents routinely left their children home, with state-subsidized nannies, to join friends in the evening for dinner or to go on dates with their husbands. When she returned to the States, she was stunned by the cultural differences she found toward how people think about effective parenting--in particular, assumptions about motherhood. None of the mothers she met seemed happy; instead, they worried about the possibility of not having the perfect child, panicking as each developmental benchmark approached.     Combining close readings of mainstream magazines, TV shows, and pop culture with a thorough command of dominant ideas in recent psychological, social, and economic theory, Perfect Madness addresses our cultural assumptions, and examines the forces that have shaped them.     Working in the tradition of classics like Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique and Christopher Lasch's The Culture of Narcissism, and with an awareness of a readership that turned recent hits like The Bitch in the House and Allison Pearson's I Don't Know How She Does It into bestsellers, Warner offers a context in which to understand parenting culture and the way we live, as well as ways of imagining alternatives--actual concrete changes--that might better our lives.",

But behind the legend, there was a highly complex and competitive marriage\u2013a union not of opposites but almost of twins who both inspired and tormented each other, and who were ultimately destroyed by their shared fantasies. Now in this frank, stylish, superbly written new book, Kendall Taylor tells the story of the Fitzgerald marriage as it has never been told before.Following the success of Fitzgerald\u2019s first novel, This Side of Paradise, Scott and Zelda took New York by storm. Scott was recognized as the greatest American author of the twenties and everyone was fascinated with Zelda, his ravishing young wife, known as the model for all his flapper heroines. Ultimately it all fell apart, and Kendall Taylor tells us why. Drawing on previously suppressed material, including crucial medical records, Taylor sheds fresh light on Zelda\u2019s depths and mysteries\u2013her rich but largely unrealized artistic talents, her own ambitions that were unfulfilled because she was Mrs. F. Scott Fitzgerald, her passionate love affairs. Zelda\u2019s contribution to Scott\u2019s fiction, which was based on her diaries, her letters, and her life, was her only great achievement\u2013and for that she may have paid the terrible price of her own sanity.In Sometimes Madness Is Wisdom, Kendall Taylor has created the definitive Fitzgerald biography. Written with sympathy, original insight, and dazzling style\u2013and featuring memorable appearances from Edmund Wilson, Gertrude Stein, and Ernest Hemingway, among others\u2013this is a stunning portrait of a marriage, an age, and a fabulous but tragic woman.From the Hardcover edition.",

They give special attention to the defeat of liberal reformers in the latest parliamentary elections and to the implications of that shift for Russia's domestic and foreign policy in the years ahead.",

        "Description": "From the sprawling cities of California to Maine's island-flecked coast, from the glaciers of Alaska to the beaches of Florida, here is the United States as you have never seen it before.    America from Space takes you into orbit over the United States. You see what Space Shuttle astronauts see when they aim their camera at their homeland. Here is America by night, a breathtaking view of the entire nation pulsating with lights marking cities and suburbs. Here are the Great Lakes, the mountains and cities, rivers and seashores -- each image a piece of the nation. Together they create a unique and fascinating portrait of the United States of America.    Sections of this book include:    Fire and Ice: Hawaii and Alaska  The West Coast: from Washington to the Mexican border  The West: the wild lands of deserts and canyon  The Rockies: the backbone of            the continent  The Heartland: the grandeur of the Great Plains  The Great Lakes: deep waters and fertile lands  The Southland: Blue Ridge Mountains, New Orleans, Florida  The Northeast Corridor: an urban swath along the coast.    In Wyoming's Bighorn Basin, stunning views are transformed into geological data: bright yellow marks an oil field, orange shows a mesa; red, purple and blue color irrigated field. In a flood region of Texas, varying blue and purple shades show what lands were under water.    What the images show most of all is the beauty of the land and the seas that touch it. \"Life is like landscape,\" Charles Lindbergh wrote after his historic solo flight across the Atlantic. \"You live in the midst of it, but can describe it only from the vantage point of distance.\" Here is a new vantage point, a new way of seeing and understanding our country.",

        "Description": "For three thousand years, people have sought personal insight and a window on the future from the I Ching, or the Book of Changes, the classic Chinese oracle and book of wisdom. Drawing on archeological findings, previously published only in Chinese, indicating how the I Ching was actually used by those who created it, and motivated by a lifetime of personal use and fascination, Kerson Huang has created a new translation of great significance. Restoring the I Ching to its original form, Huang underscores its first use as a practical oracle by Chinese farmers. His translation beautifully preserves the starkly poetic voice of the original, while his comments clearly and simply explain the images and detail the historical references buried within the verse. Huang reveals the I Ching as an epic poem equivalent to The Iliad and The Odyssey--one hexagram recalls the dethroning of Feng Feng; a series of lines portray Wang Hai, one of the three High Ancestors of the Shang dynasty; a third contains a sage proclamation of Lord Tang. Each hexagram and its corresponding interpretation is presented on a two-page spread, making this version unusually easy to use and understand. Introductory chapters detail the evolution of the I Ching, from the philosophical reinterpretations of Confucius to the modern musings of Carl Jung, and clearly explain both the coin method and yarrow-stalk method for consulting the oracle. Over 55,000 copies in print.",

        "Title": "The Roosevelt Women: A Portrait In Five Generations",
        "Authors": "By Caroli, Betty Boyd",
        "Description": "The Roosevelt name conjures up images of powerful Presidents and dashing men of high society. But few people know much about the extraordinary network of women that held the Roosevelt clan together through war, scandal, and disease. In The Roosevelt Women, Betty Boyd Caroli weaves together stories culled from a rich store of letters, memoirs, and interviews to chronicle nine extraordinary Roosevelt women across a century and a half of turbulent history.She examines the Roosevelt women as mothers, daughters, wives, and, beyond that, as world travelers, authors, campaigners, and socialites&#151;in short, as themselves. She reveals how they demonstrated the energy and intellectual curiosity that defined their famous family, as well as the roles they played in the intrigues, scandals, and accomplishments that were hallmarks of the Roosevelt clan. From the much maligned Sara Delano (who sired Franklin and by turns terrified and supported Eleanor) to Theodore&#39;s irrepressible daughter, Alice (\u201dI can either rule the country or control Alice,\u201d Teddy once said) to the beloved Bamie, who was the only mother Alice ever knew, and the model of everything she never was in life, to the exceptionally beautiful but ultimately overwhelmed Mittie, Theodore&#39;s mother, The Roosevelt Women is an intricate portrait of bold and talented women, a grand tale of both unbearable tragedies and triumphant achievements.",

        "Title": "The American West",
        "Authors": "By Brown, Dee and Schmitt, Martin Ferdinand (EDT)",
        "Description": "Renowned storyteller Dee Brown, author of the bestselling Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, recreates the struggles of Native Americans, settlers, and ranchers in this stunning volume that illuminates the history of the old West that\u2019s filled with maps and vintage photographs.Beginning with the demise of the Native Americans of the Plains, Brown depicts the onrush of the burgeoning cattle trade and the waves of immigrants who ultimately \u201csettled\u201d the land. In the retelling of this oft-told saga, Brown has demonstrated once again his abilities as a master storyteller and an entertaining popular historian. By turns heroic, tragic, and even humorous, The American West brings to life American tragedy and triumph in the years from 1840 to the turn of the century, and a roster of characters both great and small: Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, Geronimo, Dull Knife, Crazy Horse, Captain Jack, John H. Tunstall, Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, Wyatt Earp, the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang, Wild Bill Hickok, Charles Goodnight, Oliver Loving, Buffalo Bill, and many others. The American West is about cattle and the railroads; it is about settlers who came to claim a land not originally their own and how they slowly imposed law and order on these wild and untamed places; and it is about the wanton destruction of the Native American way of life. This is epic history at its best and popular history at its most readable. This new work is culled from Dee Brown\u2019s highly acclaimed writings, which instantly established him as one of America\u2019s foremost Western authorities. Fully revised, rewritten, and edited into one seamless account of America\u2019s most famous frontier, this epic narrative, along with the introduction and a chronological table of events, etches an unforgettable and poignant portrait. The American West is at once a tribute to the West and a majestic new peak for a writer whose long and successful career has been synonymous with excellence in frontier history.",

        "Title": "The New Terrorism: Fanaticism and the Arms of Mass Destruction",
        "Authors": "By Laqueur, Walter",
        "Description": "Recent attacks in Oklahoma City, at the World Trade Towers, and at American embassies in Africa demonstrate the horrifying consequences of a terrorist strike. But as technological advances make weapons of mass destruction frighteningly easy to acquire, a revolution is occurring in the very nature of terrorism--one that may make these attacks look like child's play.   In The New Terrorism Walter Laqueur, one of the foremost experts on terrorism and international strategic affairs, recounts the history of terrorism and, more importantly, examines the future of terrorist activity worldwide. Laqueur traces the chilling trend away from terrorism perpetrated by groups of oppressed nationalists and radicals seeking political change to small clusters of fanatics bent on vengeance and simple destruction. Coinciding with this trend is the alarming availability of weapons of mass destruction. Chemical and biological weapons are cheap and relatively easy to make or buy. Even nuclear devices are increasingly feasible options for terrorists. And with the information age, cyber terrorism is just around the corner. Laqueur argues that as a new quasi-religious extreme right rises, with more personal and less ideological motivations than their left-wing counterparts, it is only a matter of time before the attainability of weapons of mass destruction creates a terrifying and unstable scenario.     From militant separatism in Kashmir to state-sponsored extremism in Libya and ecoterrorism in the West, The New Terrorism offers a thorough account of terrorism in all its past and current manifestations. Most importantly, it casts a sober eye to the future, when the inevitable marriage of technology and fanaticism will give us all something new to think about.",
