        "Description": "In a remarkable synthesis incorporating an astonishing range of historic and scientific data, from the beginning of time to the present, William B. Williams analyzes the cause and effect relationships of watershed events that have resulted in the world we now live in. He then charts a road map to the future, giving us a preview of what lies ahead if we continue our present course. And finally, he compares this reality with the attainable ideal that is possible if we begin now to implement long term plans to solve the seemingly insurmountable problems we currently face.Future Perfect is more than an illumination of tomorrow. It explains how we got where we are today, what lies ahead, and what we can do to improve the quality of our lives and our world. It will challenge our deepest assumptions but the irrefutable logic of Williams' system verifies how solutions to problems are within our power to effect if we use our ability to think about the future and have the courage to act. Future Perfect can, if we heed its teachings, enable us to regain personal and societal control of our lives and, as informed citizens, regain economic and political control of our country. As Williams so clearly demonstrates, we must act now if we are to survive into the 21st century and beyond.",

Life on Hold answers the need of many people who face -- or may soon be faced with -- a health crisis of longer duration. Written by a father and daughter who lost their wife and mother to an extended battle with cancer, this sensitive personal journal is dotted with illustrations from real-life survivors. Each chapter offers tools for dealing with the challenges of physical illness. A practical, spiritual handbook, it shows sufferers, ministers, lay workers, family, and friends how to trust God during a season of recovery or release. Scripture and counsel on getting through the first several weeks are among this book's most rare and precious gifts.",

        "Description": "As his previous books Presidential Anecdotes and Presidential Campaigns clearly prove, Paul F. Boller, Jr. has a remarkable eye for the telling details that vitalize and humanize history.  Presidential Wives brings that gift to bear on the women our Presidents married by offering a poignant, amusing, dramatic, and illuminating biographical feast which covers every First Lady from Martha Washington to Nancy Reagan. These vivid and entertaining pages offer encounters with Dolley Madison, whose \"unfortunate propensity to snuff-taking\" eventually had Washington's other women doing the same; Mary Todd Lincoln, whose harsh opinions of so many of her husband's appointments led him to tell her, \"If I listened to you, I should soon be without a cabinet\"; and Eleanor Roosevelt, who lamented on the night of FDR's election to his first term that she would no longer have her own identity and then became the greatest of all the women activists to occupy the White House.     As with his earlier books, Boller devotes a chapter to each of his subjects, including a biographical essay followed by a selection of revealing anecdotes.  Portraying a diverse group of women--shrinking violets, passionate partisans, spotlight-loving hostesses, and devoted helpmates who remained silent in public but actively advised their husbands in private--Boller once again delightfully demonstrates how much the institution of the presidency and all that surrounds it tell us about ourselves as a nation.",

        "Description": "Senator Jim Jeffords's disarmingly frank memoir recounts his idyllic small-town childhood in Rutland, Vermont, his somewhat unruly adolescence, putting himself through Yale University with the help of NROTC, traveling the world during his three-year navy service, and his courtship of Elizabeth Daley when he was a Harvard Law School student.   In his first term as Vermont state senator, Jeffords already had a reputation for being a maverick Republican. He supported welfare bills and environmental protection. As Vermont's attorney general, he helped draft and then implement some of the most important legislation in the nation -- the bottle bill, ban on billboards, and land protection.  Jeffords failed in his bid to be governor of Vermont when conservative Republicans in the state turned against him. When he was elected to the House of Representatives, he was so broke that he lived in his office. Meanwhile, he was battling problems brewing at home. He and his wife divorced and later remarried. But during his congressional years, Jeffords concerned himself with issues of education, energy, and dairy farming. He was the only Republican to vote against Ronald Reagan's budget. He supported Bill Clinton's Health Care Reform and opposed his impeachment. Jeffords's disagreements with the second Bush administration and the Republican leadership led to his decision to leave the party. In My Declaration of Independence, Jeffords wrote about his decision to quit the Republican Party. Now, in this memoir, he tells us more about who he is and what he believes in and what led him to that decision.  He concludes with a section on how we must rebuild America after September 11 and why we must improve our education system. In the vein of Jimmy Carter's An Hour Before Daylight, this is another magical piece of Americana from a different part of the country, steeped in the same lasting values and tough lessons.",

Their Last Words is a remarkable homage to the lives and deaths of some of the Americans who died in the war on terror. Family and friends share fond, revealing remembrances and photographs of the men and women who answered their nation's call - and made the ultimate sacrifice. But most memorable are the haunting last letters home in which the soldiers themselves tell not only of the hardships and loneliness of war, but of their pride and determination in serving their country, and of their undying devotion to those who'd given their lives its greatest joy and meaning - the loved ones they'd never see again.  George Sheldon, author of the Washington Post bestseller When the Smoke Cleared at Gettysburg, has created a remarkable testament preserving the final words of a generation of Americans who exemplify honor, duty, and love of country - and who have given their lives so that others might live in freedom.",

Whether it's her portrayal of a mother mired in senile dementia in \"Ma,\" a young girl experiencing her first sexual encounter with an itinerant knife-sharpener in \"Under the House,\" or a young woman incapable of loving conventionally in \"An Error of Desire,\" Freed portrays the absurdity, the delusions, the dramas, and the dignity of her characters' lives. These masterful stories reinforce her reputation as one of our most fearless and sophisticated explorers of sexual and filial love.",

And by drawing on the case studies and actual lawsuits that helped shape the American education system, School Rights shows how you can play a large role in its improvements. Here are step-by-step guidelines to approach any situation, including when to meet the principal, what to present to the school board, and how to set up a PTA subcommittee.",

You might be told about a  good online help system or given some documentation that tells you about command options.  That instruction is necessary and  helpful, especially if you haven't had much computer experience.But knowing the keystrokes isn't sufficient to become an effective  and productive communicator.  You also need to understand the  context of email.  In a typical business environment, it might take  months or years -- and many mistakes -- to learn:How to organize saved mail so that you can find it againWhen to include a previous message, and how much to include, so  that your reader can quickly make sense of what's being discussedWhen a network address \"looks right,\" so that more of your messages get through the first timeWhen a 'bounced' message will never be delivered and when the bounce merely indicates temporary network difficultiesHow to successfully subscribe and unsubscribe to a mailing listHow to modify your email style depending on the expectations of your recipientsWith first-person anecdotes, examples, and general observations,Using Email Effectively shortens the learning-from-experience  curve for all mailers, so that you can quickly be productive  and send email that looks intelligent to others.The book starts with an overview of help systems and basic commands  for many mailers, and then looks at the context for understanding productivity, saved mail, network addressing, communication, mailing  lists, and sending files.",

        "Authors": "By Davis, Stanley M. and Meyer, Christopher",
        "Description": "Speed. Intangibles. Connectivity. As these three forces converge, every dimension of business behavior is being challenged to its core. If you think that business can be sustained by the old rules of mass production, segmented pricing, and stale organizations, you\u2019ll need to think again.Welcome to the new economy\u2014a world where the rate of change is so fast it\u2019s only a blur, where the clear lines distinguishing buyer from seller, product from service, employee from entrepreneur are disappearing. To profit from these revolutionary patterns of business, you need a dynamic guide to the new economy. You need BLUR.In this groundbreaking book, Stan Davis and Chris Meyer deliver more than a guided tour to these momentous shifts. They offer readers a working model to illustrate and benefit from the new rules of the connected economy, where advantage is temporary and nothing is fixed in time or space. Showcasing the practices of dozens of enterprises exploring the new frontiers of business\u2014from Amazon.com to DreamWorks SKG to MBNA America\u2014Davis and Meyer build a new frame-work for delivering and capturing value, evaluating success, developing strategy, and managing organizations in an economic world no longer determined by static measures of supply and demand.BLUR provides a lens for bringing the emerging economic landscape into focus\u2014a world in which change is constant; knowledge and imagination are more valuable than physical capital; products and services are blended as \u201doffers\u201d; transactions give way to \u201dexchanges\u201d\u2019 and physical markets take on the characteristics of financial markets. This world rewards those who buck convention, like MCI, which has reorganized every six months to release creativity, or David Bowie, who has sold options on his future earnings as an artist. Adaptability is paramount, as more companies build permeable networks of business relationships with suppliers, distributors, employees, and even competitors, and individuals become \u201dfree agents,\u201d contracting their services to the highest bidders.BLUR challenges you to question every assumption you hold about how business is conducted, and encourages you to experiment at the edges of business. BLUR outlines nothing less than a revolution in business and consumer culture. Will you watch on the sidelines as the innovators overtake you, or are you ready to start playing by\u2014and discovering\u2014the rules of BLUR?",

        "Description": "\"I first began to appreciate fully all we owed the World War II generation while I was covering the fortieth and fiftieth anniversaries of D-Day for NBC News. When I wrote in The Greatest Generation about the men and women who came out of the Depression, who won great victories and made lasting sacrifices in World War II and then returned home to begin building the world we have today--the people I called the Greatest Generation--it was my way of saying thank you. I felt that this tribute was long overdue, but I was not prepared for the avalanche of letters and responses touched off by that book.        Members of that generation were, characteristically, grateful for the attention and modest about their own lives as they shared more remarkable stories about their experiences in the Depression and during the war years.        \"Their children and grandchildren were eager to share the lessons and insights they gained from the stories they heard about the lives of a generation now passing on too swiftly. They wanted to say thank you in their own way. I had wanted to write a book about America, and now America was writing back.        \"The letters, many of them written in firm Palmer penmanship on flowered stationery, have given me a much richer understanding not only of those difficult years but also of my own life. They give us new, intensely personal perspectives of a momentous time in our history. They are the voices of a generation that has given so much and wants to share even more.        \"Some of the letters were written from the front during the war, or from families to their loved ones in harm's way in distant places. There were firsthand accounts of battles and poignant reflections on loneliness, exuberant expressions of love and somber accounts of loss.        \"It seems that everyone in that generation has something worthwhile to contribute, and so we have included some pages in The Greatest Generation Speaks for others to share memories at once inspirational and instructive.        \"If we are to heed the past to prepare for the future, we should listen to these quiet voices of a generation that speaks to us of duty and honor, sacrifice and accomplishment. I hope more of their stories will be preserved and cherished as reminders of all that we owe them and all that we can learn from them.\"             --Tom BrokawFront-jacket photo: \"She said yes!\" An American G.I. had proposed marriage to his girlfriend back home, and when her letter arrived, saying yes, he propped her photograph up in his helmet and had a buddy take this picture. --(UPICorbis-Bettmann)",

But Triana understands the power of the music perhaps even more than does Stefan--and she sets out to resist Stefan and to fight not only for her sanity but for her life. The struggle draws them both into a terrifying supernatural realm where they find themselves surrounded by memories, by horrors, and by overwhelming truths. Battling desperately, they are at last propelled towards the novel's astonishing and unforgettable climax.Violin is crowded with the history, the drama, the invention, and the romantic intensity that have become synonymous with Anne Rice at her incomparable best.",

He doesn\u2019t want blind loyalty or bored religious compliance; he longs for nothing less than our entire passionate self\u2013something most of us have yet to glimpse. God\u2019s desire is that people lean in, listen, and wrestle with him so that they can respond to him without fear.Can this God be trusted? Absolutely. Will the journey be easy? Not a chance.

And in our contemporary predicament, where so much seems beyond personal control, what is invisible generates an index of what we are. A Field Guide to the Invisible is a layman's guide to the inescapable stew we're in, a thought-provoking catalogue of life's ingredients that are literally out of sight and therefore too often out of mind.In medieval times, everyone knew the air was rife with menacing spirits--the souls of unbaptized babies, graveyard ghouls, winged demons who could rip the unwary from the world of the senses. In our own age of chronic low-dose exposure to sundry radiations; of infections from exotic microbes; of a biosphere so radically changed by the hand of man that the natural protections it once provided are no longer assured, it is still the invisible that worries us most. A Field Guide to the Invisible maps points in a parallel world, ignored at our peril, that we inhabit simultaneously with the one before our very eyes.",

With each decade, I've found myself in very different, evermore challenging arenas, but the many stages of my life have always intertwined. I have moved from one stage to the next as if on a wild steeplechase, keeping my eye fixed straight ahead and above me. If there is a single line connecting all the episodes and main events of my life it is this -- a gift both given and received.  -- from the Introduction  In Halfway Home, a beautifully written memoir, Ronan Tynan, a member of the enormously popular Irish Tenors, shares his remarkable story of overcoming adversity and attaining worldwide success in several different areas.  Diagnosed with a lower limb disability at birth, Ronan Tynan had his legs amputated below the knee when he was twenty years old. Eight weeks later, he was climbing the stairs of his college dorm, and within a year, he was winning races in the Paralympic Games, amassing eighteen gold medals and fourteen world records. After becoming the first disabled person ever admitted to the National College of Physical Education, he served a short stint in the prosthetics industry and began a new career in medicine. He continued his studies at Trinity College, where he specialized in orthopedic sports injuries.  After earning his medical degree, Ronan chose music for the next act in his life. Less than one year after he began studying voice, he won both the John McCormick Cup for Tenor Voice and the BBC talent show Go for It. He went on to win the prestigious International Operatic Singing Competition in France, and in 1998 his debut Sony album, My Life Belongs to You, became a top-five hit in England within just two weeks and eventually went platinum. Later that year, he was invited to join The Irish Tenors, furthering a journey that started in a small Irish village and has brought him to the world's grandest stages.  In Halfway Home, Tynan movingly describes his life story, which Barbara Walters called \"so amazing you may find it hard to believe.\"",

        "Authors": "By Erdrich, Louise",
        "Description": "A highway and snowy field just outside of Fargo, North Dakota, become an arena in which no encounter is meaningless, no event without echo, no simple hope impossible to realize. Stranded together in a blizzard, each of Jack Mauser's former wives tells the secret tale of burning love that will save her. Their stories repair wounded hearts as their revelations, both comic and painful, blast through the walls between them.Jack Mauser is a big and passionate man. Though initially central to each woman's tale, during a long night of shared confidences he becomes peripheral to their feelings for one another. There is Eleanor - spoiled, sensual, brainy; Candice - both tougher and more vulnerable than she can admit, especially once she is faced with her attraction to another woman; Marlis - a single mother caught up in a cycle of conflicting wishes; and Dot - both true and desperate, Jack's last and fiercest wife.",
