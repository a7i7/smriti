His writing career had taken a dubious turn, his wife had a demanding career of her own, his daughter was preparing to leave home for college, and he had become used to a sedentary lifestyle. Wonderfully witty and insightful, Running to the Mountain chronicles Katz's hunger for change and his search for renewed purpose and meaning in his familiar world.Armed with the writings of Thomas Merton and his two faithful Labradors, Katz trades in his suburban carpool-driving and escapes to the mountains of upstate New York. There, as he restores a dilapidated cabin, learns self-reliance in a lightning storm, shares a bottle of Glenlivet with unexpected ghosts, and helps a friend prepare for fatherhood, he confronts his lifelong questions about spirituality, mortality, and his own self-worth. He ultimately rediscovers a profound appreciation for his work, his family, and the beauty of everyday life--and provides a glorious lesson for us all.",

Jennie Brand-Miller, coauthor of the bestselling Glucose Revolution, called it \"without a doubt the most nutritious diet on the planet.\" Doctors Michael and Mary Dan Eades, authors of Protein Power, said, \"We can't recommend The Paleo Diet highly enough.\"Now Dr. Cordain joins with USA triathlon and cycling elite coach Joe Friel to adapt the Paleo Diet to the needs of athletes. The authors show:o Why the typical athletic diet (top-heavy with grains, starches, and refined sugars) is detrimental to recovery, performance, and healtho How the glycemic load and acid-base balance impact performanceo Why consumption of starches and simple sugars is only beneficial in the immediate post-exercise periodAt every level of competition, The Paleo Diet for Athletes can maximize performance in a range of endurance sports.",

But Pope Leo XIV has a startlingly different task in mind for him. In a private audience, Kilkenny learns of an unreported atrocity committed against the underground Church in China and its link to Yin Daoming, the long-imprisoned Bishop of Shanghai who has served thirty years of a life sentence in a Chinese laogai for refusing to renounce the Church of Rome. The pope wants Yin free and asks Kilkenny to devise a plan to accomplish this ostensibly impossible task.With help from the U.S. president, American Special Forces, and the CIA, Kilkenny assembles a team of ten men and one woman that will use some of the most advanced weapons, aircraft, and computer technology to execute this extraordinary mission.",

Now, appointed by a federal judge, Travis is obliged to speak for the defense.Much as he despises Moroconi, Travis is a professional: he'll do everything he can to get Moroconi off, even in the face of a death threat from the Mob.

The FBI is after Travis for a murder he didn't commit. The Mob wants to kill him for a secret hit list he doesn't have.
