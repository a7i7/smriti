In Kissed the Girls and Made Them Cry, Lisa Bevere tackles these tough issues by moving us from rules to relationship.  There is no question we need a renewal of purity, but what we're doing is not working.How far can you go?  Ask yourself:  What do you ultimately want?  Immediate and temporary gratification that wanes with the passage of time?  Or passion and exclusive intimacy that endures and intensifies?God wants to move us beyond the restraint of the law (which arouses sin) and plant us into a garden of longing -- where our sexuality and passion is carefully guarded and cultivated until the time for its awakening.  This is a book for every daughter in waiting and every woman who has never known desire in her life and marriage.",

Now at your fingertips is the tool that will unlock the secret to her mysterious ways. Through hundreds of interviews and the results of a scientific national survey of women, this book demonstrates that women are actually not random and that they really can be systematized and \u201cmapped.\u201d In fact, much to men\u2019s delight, this book shows that women are actually quite easy to understand and please\u2014as long as you know what it is they need. This simple map will guide you to loving your wife or girlfriend in the way she needs to be loved.

Read it!\u201d -Dennis Rainey, President, FamilyLife Story Behind the Book\u201cAs I was writing For Women Only to help women understand the inner lives of men, over and over I heard that men wished there was a way to understand their wives, but they felt it was probably impossible. I heard from them, \u2018You are writing this little slim volume about men, but if it was about understanding women, it would have to be the size of an encyclopedia! Women are random and complicated!\u2019 These men were surprised and encouraged when I assured them that women are neither random nor complicated, and we can be understood. Men just want to love their wives well, and For Men Only will help them do that.\u201d \u2014Shaunti Feldhahn",

        "Description": "What\u2019s going on in a man\u2019s mind? From their early days, every woman has struggled to understand why males behave the way they do. Even long-married women who think they understand men have only scratched the surface. Beneath a man\u2019s rugged exterior is an even more rugged, unmapped terrain. What bestselling author Shaunti Feldhahn\u2019s research reveals about the inner lives of men will open women\u2019s eyes to what the men in their life\u2014boyfriends, brothers, husbands, and sons\u2014are really thinking and feeling. Men want to be understood, but they\u2019re afraid to \u201cfreak out\u201d the women they love by confessing what is happening inside their heads. This book will guide women in how to provide the loving support that modern men want and need. The Truth About His Inner Life He Desperately Wants You to Know What's going on in there? Ever been totally confused by something your man has said or done? Want to understand his secret desires and fears, his daily battles that you know nothing about? In a woman-to-woman conversation you\u2019ll never forget, Shaunti Feldhahn takes you beneath the surface into the inner lives of men. This book is about the things we just don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 about guys. With findings from a groundbreaking national survey and personal interviews of over one thousand men, For Women Only is full of eye-opening revelations you need to not only understand the man in your life, but to support and love him in the way he needs to be loved. Grounded in biblical hope, you will discover how to love your man for who he really is\u2014not who you think he is. Story Behind the BookI had no idea how clueless I was about men until I interviewed a bunch of them for my last novel. Initially, I just wanted a little insight so I could write my main (male) character. But pretty soon I found myself astonished, over and over again blurting out, \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d So I did more interviews. After the novel hit shelves, dozens of women told me they also had been astonished by what I included. Clearly I wasn\u2019t the only one who needed more insight on this! To lay the groundwork for this nonfiction book, I wrote out the half-dozen things from these interviews that had most surprised me\u2014things that appeared to be universal to most men\u2014that women desperately needed to know. I conducted a professional national survey of men to test my findings. Yep\u2014the survey substantiated every single one. These findings are fascinating\u2014and they have already changed my life and marriage. I can\u2019t wait to share them!",

        "Description": "Trained behavior patterns, popularly known as \"tricks\"are fun for canines and their masters. This book shows dog owners how to train an animal to perform both simple and more complicated tricks. The authors begin with four basic commands--sit, down, stand, and stay--that all dogs should know and obey. From there they progress to behaviors such as wave, sit up, bow, jump through a hoop, and weave through legs. Instructions for each of the book's 25 tricks are presented with tips to help owners work through problems, and suggestions for putting the animal's training to effective use--just for fun, in competitive shows, for roles in films, and many other situations. The dog-and-master team that progresses all the way through this volume's advanced exercises will be capable of public performance! Not every dog owner will want to go that far, but all dog owners can profit from the know-how that they'll find in these pages. 150 instructive how-to color photos, and a wealth of practical tips will make training easier for both master and pet.",

        "Description": "Lonnie Barbach brought women's erotica into the mainstream with her classic collections, Pleasures: Women Write Erotica and Erotic Interludes. Now she has produced The Erotic Edge, her first book of arousing fiction for and by both men and women, designed to bring couples together, liberate and enhance their sexual pleasure, and deepen their mutual understanding of intimacy. This long-awaited new collection is a graphically intense exploration of seduction, romance, and erotic fantasy that puts no taboos on shared pleasure or the imagination of desire.Barbach has created a book that men and women can enjoy separately, read together, and use to illuminate their contrasting sexual natures. Her commentary examines the strong connection between men's sexual response and visual stimuli, contrasted with the importance of foreplay and mental seduction for women. She also offers advice on how to use particular stories as a starting point of sexual encounters.Each story is a sensual journey. \"Waiting for Claire\" by Bruce Zimmerman takes us to an upstairs room in steamy Tangier. Katherine DeRosa's \"Mirror, Mirror\" goes deep into the mind of a woman as she prepares to see her lover. \"Nighthawks\" by Erik Jendresen brings a painting to pulsing life. And \"Shy\" by Deena Metzger explores a territory where intimacy has no limits. These selections and many others cover the full range of erotic themes, from monogamous tenderness and romance to group sex, infidelity, and fantasy. The resulting anthology is wide-ranging, hot, and helpful - stimulating in every sense of the word.",

It is a book about the early part of my life, from childhood through adolescence, right up to the eve of my success with the Police. It is a story very few people know.I had no interest in writing a traditional autobiographical recitation of everything that\u2019s ever happened to me. Instead I found myself drawn to exploring specific moments, certain people and relationships, and particular events which still resonate powerfully for me as I try to understand the child I was, and the man I became.From the Hardcover edition.",

Plunging deep into the morality of a city renowned for sin -- Los Angeles -- this is the story of the murder of a girl. Edgy, intense, and possessed of a voice sharp enough to cut flesh, Coffey's piercing novel will carve its way into your psyche.  Her name is Megan Wright. Pretty. Thirteen. Nice house. Private school. When she is raped and murdered, it's a story, and Ted Lowe is the one to report it. He's been a reporter for a lot of years, but this is the first time he actually sees a body. Megan was indeed pretty. The crime scene is anything but.  As Ted smoothly uncovers the facts surrounding Megan's death, he finds that the glittery facade of her perfect life was just that -- a thin sheen easily wiped away with the answers to a few questions. Megan was secretive. She stayed out late. Her parents were divorced. And she was seeing a boy.  The suspects slowly accumulate: the cold-as-ice mother, the surfer-deadbeat father, the friends, the boyfriend who happens to be the son of one of the richest men in California. It could be any one of them. For any reason. And the spun-out decay of an entire city begins to close in around Ted: he's written too many tragic accounts, listened to the police band so long it might as well be background noise...and watched helplessly as his emotions fell away from him like dead leaves.  Suddenly, Ted's questions stop being answered. Phones slam down, doors slam shut. And he realizes that while he has managed to gather more facts and leads than even the police, there are some people who do not want this case solved. And if the life of a thirteen-year-old girl was worth taking, so is the life of a reporter who's seen too much.  Exhibiting a supreme talent for heart-pounding twists, Tom Coffey brings readers a slick and riveting mystery, a page-turner sure to prove one of the most stunning suspense novels of the year.",

        "Title": "A Wild Ride Up the Cupboards: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Bauer, Ann",
        "Description": "Edward is nearly four years old when he begins his slow, painful withdrawal from the world. For those who love him -- his father, Jack, and mother, Rachel, pregnant with their third child -- the transformation of their happy, intelligent firstborn into a sleepless, feral stranger is a devastating blow, one that brings enormous ramifications not just for Edward and his parents, but also for their younger son, Matt, and soon-to-be-born daughter.A Wild Ride Up the Cupboards follows this nuclear family as Rachel and Jack try to come to terms with their son's descent into autism (or something like it) and struggle to sustain their marriage under this unanticipated strain. Threaded through the novel, too, is the story of Rachel's deceased uncle Mickey, who may have suffered from a similar disorder at a time when parenting, pediatrics, and ideas about child psychology were entirely different from today's. As Rachel delves into her own family history in search of answers, flashbacks to Mickey's life afford moving insight into the nature of childhood disorders and the coping mechanisms of different families.A spellbinding, brilliantly nuanced portrait of a marriage and a family, this compelling drama also poses provocative, real-life questions: How much should a mother sacrifice for her children? How much intervention is too much? When do parents' ambitions for their offspring become counterproductive, even destructive? Who should decide what is best for the child? Is it ever worth sacrificing a marriage for a child?A Wild Ride Up the Cupboards is a carefully crafted, compulsively readable, emotional page-turner that reveals a remarkable gift for language and storytelling and enormous insight into the complexities and dilemmas of domestic life and parenthood. It is a striking exploration of love, faith, and sacrifice that will resonate with readers everywhere.",

She was not going to marry Brett Loftus either...Notorious deal maker Elias Winters had changed gears and settled in Whispering Waters Cove. He'd been studying martial arts and Asian philosophy with one burning goal in mind - only to discover that he'd been swept into unknown emotional seas...Facing crises of career and heart, two of the most powerful corporate figures in the Northwest are now borne by the unpredictable currents of fate to the same small Washington town, and to their respective shops - a bookstore for Charity and a small curiosity shop called Charms and Virtues for Elias. When they meet, the attraction is immediate. But the results may be...murder!Land speculation is booming in the town - and no one, especially Charity Truitt, believes that Elias Winters has suddenly stopped outswimming the corporate sharks just to run a small business. As Charity and Elias begin a cautious exploration of each other's pasts, hidden agendas, and libidos, they discover one thing they definitely have in common. A martial arts master, he's a novice at relationships; a formidable executive, she's starting in the mail room when it comes to love. And all around them, Sixties-style rebels are clashing with BMW-driving professionals. Then, after two shocking murders, Charity and Elias really join forces to catch a killer - and become next in line for an early demise.",
