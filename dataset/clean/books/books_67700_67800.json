        "Description": "America is going to the dogs. And, judging by the $7 billion we spend each year on veterinary services, and the $3 billion on prescription medicines, we will do anything to take care of our beloved pets. Now there's a bible that belongs in every dog owner's home--a clear, comprehensive, trustworthy guide that comes with the same pedigree as the What to Expect books, The Garden Primer, and The Wine Bible.  Written by Betsy Brevitz, D.V.M., the resident veterinarian of the popular and award-winning Web site Urbanhound.com, Hound Health Handbook is the first truly readable book on dog health. Dr. Brevitz, a writer and editor before becoming a veterinarian, knows how to make complex issues simple, and how to present detailed information in a lively and authoritative way. Reading this book, with its hundreds of real-life Q&A's, is like joining a conversation between a smart and caring vet and a community of fellow dog lovers. Organized in four parts--Preventive Health Care, Common Canine Maladies, First Aid for Injuries and Emergencies, and Hound Health Resources--it covers everything from puppy vaccinations to caring for the senior dog; kennel cough to cancer; and even mental health issues such as separation anxiety and canine Alzheimer's disease. A health checklist for 120 popular breeds tells what hereditary problems to watch for, and the first aid and emergency section offers quick, clear instructions on what to do when something goes wrong. The 100-plus illustrations are both beautiful and informative, and include numerous how-to diagrams and guides.",

        "Description": "The reunited Germany that emerged from the euphoria of 1989 - that miraculous moment when the Wall fell and all the world cheered - is neither a power to be feared nor a rich, stable democracy to be admired. Far from freeing the Germans from the burdens of history, the fall of the Wall has exacerbated the traumas of the past, leaving Germany divided - against itself, east from west: against the \"other,\" its own six million foreign residents as well as hundreds of thousands of new immigrants who arrive each year; and most of all, against the continuing legacy of the Nazi and communist eras. The readmission of sixteen million East German residents has uncovered old wounds and lifted half a century of taboos.Blending essay and reportage and drawing on countless interviews with people from all sides, Marc Fisher tells stories that reveal a seething and chaotic nation handicapped by its past and struggling to define its role at home and abroad. These personal stories touch on the lingering fear of a mighty Germany, memories of the Holocaust, Germany's economic role as the engine of Europe, and its diplomatic role as the strongest nation at the border of the troubled former Soviet Bloc.",

        "Description": "From the early career of Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, and the early life of Giants quarterback Eli Manning, Manning provides a compelling look at football from the perspectives of two generations of players in the only family to claim four Superbowl victories and 18 Pro Bowl wins.Manning\u00a0is an autobiographical history of the football industry written by football legend Peyton Manning and his father, an all-star in his own right, Archie Manning.\u00a0 At the time, one was an experienced and battle-scarred father, and the other was a son who has exploded on to the national scene as one of the best young quarterbacks in the history of the NFL.\u00a0 Together, they take a hard look at their own careers and comb through all of American football: dissecting the big-money madness, race relations within the NFL (and in sports in general), the rituals of bribery that mark college recruiting, and fans who can no longer identify with the insatiable cash fever in pro sports. They discuss organizational sports and why white youngsters aren\u2019t out there playing the game like they used to; the college game as compared to the pros; coaches, good and bad; and why the quarterback position is the most difficult one in all of sports.This is the story of Peyton's dizzying rise to the elite of the NFL, and the story of his father, himself a #1 draft pick for the New Orleans Saints in 1971, who harkens back to a time when football and gallantry were one and the same. Archie helps guide Peyton through the money, the endorsements, and the everyday life in the NFL. Meanwhile, Archie\u2019s youngest son, Eli, picks up the gauntlet as he begins playing quarterback for Archie's alma mater, Ole Miss.MANNING is a truly personal and inspiring story of a family, a tradition and a legacy, providing a stirring multigenerational \u2014 and at times controversial \u2014 look at football over the past 50 years.",

        "Title": "Talking with Young Children about Adoption",
        "Authors": "By Watkins, Mary and Fisher, Susan",
        "Description": "Current wisdom holds that adoptive parents should talk with their child about adoption as early as possible. But no guidelines exist to prepare parents for the various ways their children might respond when these conversations take place. In this wise and sympathetic book, a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist, both adoptive mothers, discuss how young children make sense of the fact that they are adopted, how it might appear in their play, and what worries they and their parents may have. Accounts by twenty adoptive parents of conversations about adoption with their children, from ages two to ten, graphically convey what the process of sharing about adoption is like. The book will be of invaluable help to parents, teachers, mental health professionals, and lawyers as they deal with the concerns young children have about being adopted.Mary Watkins and Susan Fisher begin by discussing parental fantasies and concerns that interfere with talking about adoption with their children. They then review the often outdated and disheartening adoption research, showing how its results can be distorted by apprehension and bias. They next discuss how adoption conversation evolves between parents and young children, what the child at various developmental stages does and does not understand, what kinds of questions the young child has, and how these questions reflect more general developmental issues. The heart of the book consists of the stories from families\u2014nuclear, single- parent, lesbian, and interracial families, families with adopted children only, families with both biological and adopted children, families that adopted a child after first foster-parenting. These stories make it clear how early sharing about adoption establishes a family atmosphere in which worries and concerns can freely arise and be addressed, allowing the fact of adoption to strengthen family understanding, honesty, and intimacy. An appendix lists by age the adoption comments, related questions, and play sequences of children.",

By the end of World War II, he was a battle-worn Marine bomber pilot who'd survived scores of missions in the Pacific. With stunning eloquence and breathtaking clarity, Samuel Hynes, Woodrow Wilson Professor of Literature at Princeton University, recaptures those extraordinary years: the tough flight-training over makeshift airfields; the rich camaraderie nurtured in cockpits and gin mills; the bawdy romantic escapades; the wives and sweethearts left behind. He evokes the madness of war, the exhilaration and tedium, and the absurd horror of seeing friends fall. And finally, he writes of the wonder of flying -- that exquisite harmony between pilot and machine, as the specter of sudden death flickers on the horizon. Hynes' memoir is no commonplace combat tale, but a powerful personal odyssey...one man's special rite of passage in that timeless world of innocence gone to war.",

        "Title": "Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution - and How It Can Renew America, Release 2.0",
        "Authors": "By Friedman, Thomas L.",
        "Description": "A New York Times Book Review Notable Book of the Year A Washington Post Best Book of the Year A Businessweek Best Business Book of the Year A Chicago Tribune Best Book of the Year In this brilliant, essential book, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Thomas L. Friedman speaks to America's urgent need for national renewal and explains how a green revolution can bring about both a sustainable environment and a sustainable America. Friedman explains how global warming, rapidly growing populations, and the expansion of the world's middle class through globalization have produced a dangerously unstable planet--one that is \"hot, flat, and crowded.\"  In this Release 2.0 edition, he also shows how the very habits that led us to ravage the natural world led to the meltdown of the financial markets and the Great Recession.  The challenge of a sustainable way of life presents the United States with an opportunity not only to rebuild its economy, but to lead the world in radically innovating toward cleaner energy.  And it could inspire Americans to something we haven't seen in a long time--nation-building in America--by summoning the intelligence, creativity, and concern for the common good that are our greatest national resources. Hot, Flat, and Crowded is classic Thomas L. Friedman: fearless, incisive, forward-looking, and rich in surprising common sense about the challenge--and the promise--of the future.",

        "Title": "An American Life",
        "Authors": "By Reagan, Ronald",
        "Description": "In this remarkable autobiography, Ronald Reagan presents a definitive personal account of his historic presidency. With uncompromising candor, modesty, and wit, he tells the story of his life -- public and private -- and reveals the events that shaped his reluctant candidacy and the decision-making process that led to his first nomination; the unseen dangers of Gorbachev's first visit to America; startling facts about top-secret meetings involving heads of state; his frustrations with Congress; and his relationships with the members of his Cabinet.  Here are the behind-the-scenes details of the great themes and dramatic crises marking Reagan's eight years in office, from Lebanon to Grenada, from the struggle to achieve arms control to tax reform, and his unprecedented personal diplomacy with major foreign leaders. His narrative is full of new insights and often surprising revelations regarding his innermost feelings about life in the White House, the assassination attempt, his family -- and the enduring love between him and his wife Nancy.  An American Life is an inspiring American success story, a brilliant self-portrait, and a compelling and significant work of history.",

        "Description": "CNBC's David Faber takes an in-depth look at the causes and consequences of the recent financial collapseAnd Then the Roof Caved In lays bare the truth of the credit crisis, whose defining emotion at every turn has been greed, and whose defining failure is the complicity of the U.S. government in letting that greed rule the day. Written by CNBC's David Faber, this book painstakingly details the truth of what really happened with compelling characters who offer their first-hand accounts of what they did and why they did it.Page by page, Faber explains the events of the previous seven years that planted the seeds for the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. He begins in 2001, when the Federal Reserve embarked on an unprecedented effort to help the economy recover from the attacks of 9/11 by sending interest rates to all time lows. Faber also gives you an up-close look at where the crisis was incubated and unleashed upon the world-Wall Street-and introduces you to insiders from investment banks and mortgage lenders to ratings agencies, that unwittingly conspired to insure lending standards were abandoned in the head long rush for profits.Based on two years of research, this book provides deep background into the current credit crisisOffers the insights of experienced professionals-from Alan Greenspan to prominent bankers and regulators-who were on the front linesCreated by David Faber, the face of morning business news on CNBC, and host of the network's award winning documentariesFrom regulators who tried to stop this problem before it swung out of control to hedge fund managers who correctly foresaw the coming housing crash and profited from it, And Then the Roof Caved In shows you how the crisis we currently face came to be.",
