When a key witness for the prosecution ends up dead, Crone's acquittal is all but assured.

        "Title": "Father Joe: The Man Who Saved My Soul",
        "Authors": "By Hendra, Tony",
        "Description": "A key comic writer of the past three decades has created his most heartfelt and hard-hitting book. Father Joe is Tony Hendra\u2019s inspiring true story of finding faith, friendship, and family through the decades-long influence of a surpassingly wise Benedictine monk named Father Joseph Warrillow.Like everything human, it started with sex. In 1955, fourteen-year-old Tony found himself entangled with a married Catholic woman. In Cold War England, where Catholicism was the subject of news stories and Graham Greene bestsellers, Tony was whisked off by the woman\u2019s husband to see a priest and be saved.Yet what he found was a far cry from the priests he\u2019d known at Catholic school, where boys were beaten with belts or set upon by dogs. Instead, he met Father Joe, a gentle, stammering, ungainly Benedictine who never used the words \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201cguilt,\u201d who believed that God was in everyone and that \u201cthe only sin was selfishness.\u201d During the next forty years, as his life and career drastically ebbed and flowed, Tony discovered that his visits to Father Joe remained the one constant in his life\u2014the relationship that, in the most serious sense, saved it.From the fifties and his adolescent desire to join an abbey himself; to the sixties, when attending Cambridge and seeing the satire of Beyond the Fringe convinced him to change the world with laughter, not prayer; to the seventies and successful stints as an original editor of National Lampoon and a writer of Lemmings, the off-Broadway smash that introduced John Belushi and Chevy Chase; to professional disaster after co-creating the legendary English series Spitting Image; from drinking to drugs, from a failed first marriage to a successful second and the miracle of parenthood\u2014the years only deepened Tony\u2019s need for the wisdom of his other and more real father, creating a bond that could not be broken, even by death.A startling departure for this acclaimed satirist, Father Joe is a sincere account of how Tony Hendra learned to love. It\u2019s the story of a whole generation looking for a way back from mockery and irony, looking for its own Father Joe, and a testament to one of the most charismatic mentors in modern literature.",

        "Authors": "By Sigerson, Davitt",
        "Description": "Risky, fiercely erotic and deeply touching, Davitt Sigerson\u2019s first novel is a revealing excursion into the shadowy territory where love and lust merge and the line between devotion and compulsion disappears.Nick is a trader on the London Stock Exchange, an honest, decent man. He has never been with anyone as desirable as Trish, so attuned to his moods and ready to embody his most intimate desires. Trish, an international marketing executive, is a completely modern woman: capable and self-confident, romantic and unabashedly sexual. Attracted by Nick\u2019s good looks, his compassion and boyish charms, she falls for him, and within two months of their first meeting they are married. But when Trish\u2019s past intrudes upon their happiness she makes a choice that will take their lives in extraordinary directions.Gliding between poignant depictions of fatherhood and scenes of high voltage sex, Davitt Sigerson has crafted a luminously written story about people\u2014like ourselves\u2014who try to do the right thing yet still manage to make a mess of their lives. Written with intelligence, kindness and an unfiltered awareness of the ways in which today\u2019s women experience their sexual prowess, Faithful is a stunning debut.",

        "Title": "Treachery: How America's Friends and Foes Are Secretly Arming Our Enemies",
        "Authors": "By Gertz, Bill",
        "Description": "\"A blockbuster book . . . Just astounding.\"\u2014Rush Limbaugh\"Explosive . . . A methodical, well-thought-out, easy-to-read book . . . that will shock the average American.\"\u2014Sean HannityIn his explosive new book, New York Times bestselling author Bill Gertz uncovers the most significant threat to U.S. national security today: America\u2019s enemies\u2014including radical terrorist groups\u2014are arming themselves with the world\u2019s most dangerous weapons. And they\u2019re doing it with the help of America\u2019s supposed allies. Worst of all, the U.S. has let it all happen.Using his unparalleled access to the U.S. intelligence and defense communities, Gertz names names, revealing which of our \u201cfriends\u201d have placed greed over principle to make America\u2019s enemies far more deadly and the world a far more dangerous place. In Treachery, Gertz tells the whole story, complete with previously unpublished classified intelligence documents, and based on dozens of exclusive interviews with senior U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. In shocking detail, Treachery exposes: \u2022How Iraqi insurgents are killing U.S. soldiers with weapons that France, Germany, and Russia sold them\u2022How the French and German governments turn a blind eye to arms sales to rogue regimes and terrorist states like Iran, Syria, and North Korea \u2022How intelligence reports show that China supplied arms to al Qaeda after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America\u2022The real story of why Libya dismantled its nuclear program\u2014how U.S. intelligence caught the Libyans red-handed trying to smuggle in nuclear weapons technology\u2022How Pakistan\u2019s nuclear proliferation network is even more extensive than has been reported\u2022The CIA report revealing that al Qaeda is pursuing\u2014and may already have\u2014nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons\u2022The classified intelligence showing that Russia and France were cooperating with Saddam Hussein even after the 2003 Iraq war broke out \u2022The full story of how Saddam exploited the United Nations \u201coil for food\u201d program, not only to line his own pockets but also to rebuild Iraq\u2019s weapons and missile programs\u2022How U.S. security lapses have enabled our enemies to target Americans using our own weapons technology secretsOnly Bill Gertz has the contacts and the knowledge to tell the complete story of how France, Germany, Russia, China, and other countries have armed our enemies to the teeth. Treachery is also the definitive account of what the U.S. government is doing to counter the threat\u2014and of how our leaders have too often failed us. \u201cGertz is legendary among national security reporters for the quality of his sources...He is the envy of his competitors.\u201d\u2014Washington Monthly\u201cTreachery, with its reams of classified and other inside information, reveals how our nation\u2019s enemies obtain weapons from China, Russia, France, Germany, and other supposed friends.

The first is the capability of our military systems as determined by the health of our defense industrial base. And, second, the extent to which our adversaries are able to buy or steal advanced military technology from the U.S. and our allies. Bill Gertz focuses superbly on the hemorrhaging of critical military technology to our enemies.

        "Description": "From New York Times bestselling author and former top prosecutor Linda Fairstein comes an electrifying new thriller rich with the riveting behind-the-scenes authenticity that only she can offer....  It's going to be a tough trial. Manhattan sex-crimes prosecutor Alexandra Cooper's case, involving an attack on investment banker Paige Vallis, would be difficult to prove even without the latest development -- it seems that Paige has something to hide.  Most of her story is clear. She'd had dinner with New York consultant Andrew Tripping three times before the March evening when she accepted his invitation to accompany him to his apartment. But what occurred that night? Why didn't she leave the apartment when he started to act strangely? What about Tripping's little boy, Dulles? What happened to the child that fateful evening? And who is the strange man whose appearance in the courtroom seems to terrify Paige?  While Alex's police detective friend Mercer Wallace helps her learn more of the sad details behind the increasingly puzzling rape case, colleague Mike Chapman is uptown in a decaying Harlem brownstone where eighty-two-year-old McQueen Ransome has been murdered, her apartment ransacked.  What could this impoverished, elderly woman have possessed that could have inspired such violence? Photographs on the wall suggest that \"Queenie\" was once a beautiful and voluptuous young woman who traveled to faraway places. Could there be a clue to her murder in her exotic background?     Her murder will be only the first. Others follow, as the tragic strands of the Paige Vallis and McQueen Ransome cases begin to converge in a poignant alliance of two women from very different worlds.        Faced with formidable personal and professional choices, Alex must learn the old lesson that appearances can deceive, even as she heads for a showdown in which her wits and her courage will be tested as never before.  With its winning combination of courtroom drama, historical detail, and the intriguing lore of a rare object whose fabled provenance provides a glistening thread through the story, The Kills is powerful, stylish writing from a hugely appealing crime-writing star.",

        "Title": "In an Uncertain World: Tough Choices from Wall Street to Washington",
        "Authors": "By Weisberg, Jacob and Rubin, Robert Edward",
        "Description": "Robert Rubin was sworn in as the seventieth U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in January 1995 in a brisk ceremony attended only by his wife and a few colleagues. As soon as the ceremony was over, he began an emergency meeting with President Bill Clinton on the financial crisis in Mexico. This was not only a harbinger of things to come during what would prove to be a rocky period in the global economy; it also captured the essence of Rubin himself--short on formality, quick to get into the nitty-gritty.From his early years in the storied arbitrage department at Goldman Sachs to his current position as chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup, Robert Rubin has been a major figure at the center of the American financial system. He was a key player in the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. With In an Uncertain World, Rubin offers a shrewd, keen analysis of some of the most important events in recent American history and presents a clear, consistent approach to thinking about markets and dealing with the new risks of the global economy.Rubin's fundamental philosophy is that nothing is provably certain. Probabilistic thinking has guided his career in both business and government. We see that discipline at work in meetings with President Clinton and Hillary Clinton, Chinese premier Zhu Rongji, Alan Greenspan, Lawrence Summers, Newt Gingrich, Sanford Weill, and the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan. We see Rubin apply it time and again while facing financial crises in Asia, Russia, and Brazil; the federal government shutdown; the rise and fall of the stock market; the challenges of the post-September 11 world; the ongoing struggle over fiscal policy; and many other momentous economic and political events.With a compelling and candid voice and a sharp eye for detail, Rubin portrays the daily life of the White House-confronting matters both mighty and mundane--as astutely as he examines the challenges that lie ahead for the nation. Part political memoir, part prescriptive economic analysis, and part personal look at business problems, In an Uncertain World is a deep examination of Washington and Wall Street by a figure who for three decades has been at the center of both worlds.",

The Friels examine the seven most ineffective and self-defeating behaviors that parents display again and again. Working from the ideas that even small changes can have big results, the authors give parents concrete steps they can take to end the behaviors and improve the quality of their parenting. Whether readers are contemplating starting a family, have children who haven't entered school yet, are struggling with rebellious teenagers, or are empty-nesters wondering how they can be better parents to their grown children, they can't afford not to read this book. With the same clarity and concrete examples that have sold over 350,000 copies of their books, the Friels offer readers forty years of combined experience as practicing psychologists, and fifty years of combined experience as blended-family parents. This material has been field-tested in the authors' own household, with hundreds of their clients, and with thousands of their workshop and Clearlife Clinic participants. It will cause immediate changes in parents' behavior, and immediate improvement in the lives of their children.",

It is about what is beautiful, true, and lasting in our country, and it is sure to lift your spirit, and encourage all of us to live up to our deepest ideals.  The contributors range from such well-known figures as novelist Anna Quindlen, who celebrates our unity in diversity, to Dinesh D\u2019Souza who learned that in America he could write the story of his own life, to immigrants from every corner of the earth who express profound gratitude for their new homeland. Carol Moseley-Braun, the first African-American senator, and Madeleine Albright, the first female secretary of state, share their pride in how far America has come in its brief history. The values Americans treasure come to life in the first-person stories of \u201cordinary people\u201d such as Dan O\u2019Neill, who founded Mercy Corps to help share America\u2019s abundance with those less fortunate throughout the world. A guest list of celebrities as diverse as Colin Powell, Jimmy Carter, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Marianne Williamson, Paul Simon, Bill O\u2019Reilly, and Yogi Berra reveals a nation built on foundations of freedom, equality, and compassion.The spiritual foundations of the nation come to life in historic documents and inspiring speeches\u2013including the Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation, John F. Kennedy\u2019s inaugural address, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s letter from a Birmingham jail.A book of great spirit and generosity, just like the land it portrays, I Like Being American showcases in words and pictures why 300 million people of every age, religion, ethnicity, and race are proud to say with one voice: \u201cI like being American!\u201d",

Here, two sixteen-year-olds present typical dialogues between parents and teens-and then translate them.  Now parents can find out why, even though they think they're being helpful, they're suddenly getting the silent treatment-and how changing just a few words can make a world of difference. Inside are sections on money, personal privacy, academic pressure, siblings, drugs, clothing, and how to become more involved without becoming overbearing. Decoding each other's languages can build a bridge between parent and child-and create a bond that lasts long after the turmoil of the teen years is over.",

        "Title": "A Different Drummer: My Thirty Years with Ronald Reagan",
        "Authors": "By Deaver, Michael K. and Reagan, Nancy (FRW)",
        "Description": "\"I had come to adore and respect the president like a second father. Reagan was once asked if he thought of me as another son. He thought a minute and said, 'Son, no. Brother, maybe.'\"A warm, personal portrait of Ronald Reagan, A Different Drummer brims with recollections from a relationship that has spanned more than three decades. Former aide and longtime family friend, Michael Deaver first met Ronald Reagan during his 1966 campaign for governor of California and later served him in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., as the president's deputy chief of staff. Whether it was traveling with Reagan on endless campaign flights, discussing the day-to-day issues in the Oval Office, or surviving the harrowing assassination attempt, Deaver worked with the former chief executive for twenty consecutive years. Now he offers his memories of Ronald Reagan as governor, president, and friend.In 1964, after Barry Goldwater's unsuccessful bid for the presidency, the Republican Party found itself in disarray, and Michael Deaver, a young party operative, a \"red meat conservative,\" was looking for a new party leader he could believe in. He threw his hat in with a former actor and General Electric spokesperson, a man who would later prove himself capable of joining the disparate elements of the Party and securing the nomination. In what would be the first of many underestimations, the Democratic Party eagerly takes on Reagan. He would not only go on to win the governorship of California, but he would serve two terms. In 1976 he was unable to unseat President Gerald Ford for the presidential nomination but, undeterred, he returned in 1980 and won a landslide victory, leading America to remarkable heights of prosperity and confidence.Yet as one of the most successful and popular presidents in American history, Reagan remains a mystery even to biographers with total access. In A Different Drummer, Deaver writes of the Reagan he has known: a man who was shy and deplored talking about himself, who would rather spend a party talking to a laborer than policy wonks; a man whose convictions remained unchanged over the course of his life, who never used pollsters to decide his position on issues; a man whose idea of relaxation was riding a horse, fixing fence posts, and chopping wood until his muscles ached and his hands blistered. Reagan emerges in this impressionistic portrait as charismatic and unwaveringly optimistic, a devoted husband and dedicated leader, disciplined and tough. As Deaver points out in his introduction, \"He worked eight years doing the toughest job on earth; crisscrossed the world; and survived an assassin's bullet, a devastating riding accident, cancer, and brain surgery all after he turned seventy.\"Writing not only of their dizzying highs, Deaver also shares the lows, including the tough times that would test the strength of their friendship. Finally, he shares a poignant look at Reagan today as he battles Alzheimer's disease. It is Nancy Reagan's \"finest hour,\" Deaver writes, a validation of the greatest love story he has ever known.With anecdotes that are insightful, entertaining, intimate, and surprising, A Different Drummer sheds remarkable new light on an American icon admired by many and understood by few.",

        "Description": "Not since the publication of Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose has a novelist created such a mesmerizing mix of murder, intrigue, and historical detail. In Lempriere's Dictionary, Lawrence Norfolk weaves these elements into an epic tale of institutional greed and passionate revenge, all set against a rich backdrop of classical mythology.At the heart of this spellbinding story are three seemingly unrelated historical events: as the seventeenth century opens, a band of venturers forms the Honorable Company of Merchants, trading from England to the East Indies - the East India Company; meanwhile in France, a city is burned and thirty thousand men, women, and children are massacred - the siege of La Rochelle; and almost two centuries later, John Lempriere writes his celebrated dictionary of classical mythology - Lempriere's Dictionary.This much is fact. Norfolk's extraordinary fiction shows how the first two events led inescapably to the third.Told with the narrative drive of a political thriller and a Dickensian panorama of place and time, this astonishing tale encompasses the Great Voyages of Discovery, multinational financial conspiracies, a centuries-old murderous feud, and central to these, the fevered writing of John Lempriere's dictionary. Appearing throughout is a glorious cast of scholars and eccentrics, drunken aristocrats, whores and assassins, paranoid magistrates, and octogenarian pirates, all brilliantly depicted across three continents and the world of classical mythology.",

When Sunny Fogarty, the extremely nubile female treasurer of the tony privately owned Whitcomb Funeral Homes, reports a suspicious rise in turnover, Archy's interest is piqued in more ways than one.Archy makes it his business to get acquainted with the Whitcomb family: the dying Sarah; her doting husband, Horace; their smooth-as-a-salesman son, Oliver; and his ditzy wife, Mitzi, who falls for - of all people - Binky. With his dapper dress and haute tastes, the articulate Archy is an instant hit.

        "Description": "An utterly original mix of memoir, astute social observation, and bravura nature writing, this collection of personal essays marks the debut of a writer of extraordinary aplomb and brio.Imagine the literary love child of Joan Didion and Walt Whitman and you have something approaching the heady blend of precision and elegy that is Bia Lowe. Casting a keen and knowing eye on a variety of life's conditions, Lowe takes readers on her minutely observed journeys. Whether she's recounting the natural history of the pigeon or her stint as drummer for The Love Machine, an all-lesbian garage band, her gorgeous, unstintingly honest voice finds the universal in the particular, the sacred in the mundane.Each essay reads like a conversation with an intimate friend: the world is a body to be explored, and Lowe maps it as closely as her own anatomy. An allergic sneeze yields a wide-ranging spray of gemlike observations about psychosomatic illness, the quality of the air in Los Angeles, and our disappointment with the frailties of our bodies. A skunk's trespass in a quiet garden breeds a meditation on the nature of fear, the persistence of memory, and the odor of a lover's infidelity. An essay on blood, the \"salty bouillon\" in our veins, prompts Lowe on an intimate journey from the \"amniotic sea\" to her adolescent wrestling with the legacy of her father's alcoholism.Swept along by the momentum of Wild Ride, one can only marvel at the subtlety of her eye, her innate ear for language, and the organic cohesion of this collection as a whole, which completely defies genre. This is virtuosic writing, sure to find a readership as broad as the author's vision.",

Founder of U.S. counter-intelligence, hunter of moles and foes of America, his name has become synonymous with skulduggery and subterfuge. Angleton pursued his enemies, real and imagined, with a cool, calculating intelligence. Eventually convinced that there was a turncoat within the highest reaches of the U.S. government, Angleton turned all of his considerable skills to finding and exposing him. The result was a near-victory for U.S. Intelligence-and total defeat for himself. A brilliant re-creation of a world that included Soviet defectors, the infamous traitors Burgess, MacLean, and Philby, and American presidents from Truman to Carter, Spytime traces the making-and unmaking-of a man without a peer and, at the end, a man without a country to serve.",

And his listeners have always loved his commonsense approach to the many political and social issues that are addressed on his show every day.  Hamblin is also a prolific writer; his column appears weekly in the Denver Post and is nationally syndicated. In Plain Talk and Common Sense from the Black Avenger, Hamblin has collected his best pieces, and they offer quite a compelling -- and sometimes controversial -- look at the recent issues that have Americans talking and debating. From personalities like Bill Clinton, O.J. Simpson and Monica Lewinsky to issues like affirmative action, gun control, crime and capital punishment, Hamblin brings his unique, clear-eyed and at times firebrand logic and vision to the problems and situations that arise on our landscape. Whether he is speculating on how feminism might have created a Monica Lewinsky or taking a pro-choice stance against most conservative thinkers' views, what Hamblin brings out most poignantly is a brash belief in America -- a patriot's belief that the dream is alive and well, though at times under assault from both ends of the spectrum.  Plain Talk and Common Sense from the Black Avenger is vintage Hamblin. His take on what matters to millions in America today is thought-provoking and eloquent, yet delivered in a language that most people understand. That kind of speaking is exactly what makes Hamblin such a joy to his millions of fans and what makes this book such a provocative experience.",

The American historian Henry Adams, grandson of one President and great-grandson of another, is looking for Miriam Talbott, a young American woman studying in Paris. Miriam is alive in ways Adams can scarcely remember being: bright, beguiling, talented, and attractive. She draws him out of the \"posthumous\" life he has led since the suicide of his wife, Clover, seven years before. But when he goes looking for Miriam, no one at her given address has seen her. And when another woman's body is fished out of the Seine and identified as hers, Adams knows she is in trouble and needs his assistance. Adams soon discovers that Miriam's disappearance is somehow involved with the great Panama Affair that threatens to engulf France. Before it went bankrupt, the French Panama Canal Company had bribed nearly half the members of the Chamber of Deputies to gain legislation favorable to its interests. Now one director of the company has been found dead; other directors flee; and for a week, the entire city awaits the revelation of the names of the chequards, the long list of deputies witless enough to have accepted their bribes in the form of checks.",

Judith Miller, a reporter who has covered the Middle east for twenty years, takes us inside the militant Islamic movements in ten countries: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Algeria, Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Isreal and Iran. She shows that just as there is no unified Arab world, so there is no single Islam: The movements are as different as the countries in which they are rooted.  Vivid and comprehensive, Miller's first-and report reveals the meaning of the tumultuous events that will continue to affect the prospects for Arab-Isreali peace and the potential for terrorism worlwide.",
