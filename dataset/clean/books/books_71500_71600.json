Suddenly, that life was over. Her husband, Josiah, announced that he was leaving her and their two young sons.When Josiah took a teaching job at a Midwestern college, Isabel and their sons moved with him from New York City to Ohio, where Isabel taught acting, threw herself into the college community, and delighted in the less-scheduled lives of toddlers raised away from the city. But within a few months, the marriage was over. The life Isabel had made crumbled. \"Happens every day,\" said a friend.Far from a self-pitying diatribe, Happens Every Day reads like an intimate conversation between friends. Gillies has written a dizzyingly candid, compulsively readable, ultimately redemptive story about love, marriage, family, heartbreak, and the unexpected turns of a life. On the one hand, reading this book is like watching a train wreck. On the other hand, as Gillies herself says, it is about trying to light a candle instead of cursing the darkness, and loving your life even if it has slipped away. Hers is a remarkable new voice -- instinctive, funny, and irresistible.",

After the publication of Joan Wester Anderson's New York Times bestseller WHERE ANGELS WALK, people urged her to write a book entirely about children's experiences with angels -- and sent along their own personal narratives as witness to these miraculous visitations.AN ANGEL TO WATCH OVER ME is the result: a wonderful collection of stories that documents and describes the extraordinary encounters between children and celestial visions. There's the grandmotherly angel who consoles an ailing girl in a hospital emergency room, and the angel who helps a Texas boy lose his fear of thunderstorms. There are angels who combat darkness, bring glad tidings, and offer comfort. For those who read this wondrous book, angels become a warm and loving presence in everyday life, a blessed part of being.",

        "Description": "Most of us know what it feels like to fall under the spell of food\u2014when one slice of pizza turns into half a pie, or a handful of chips leads to an empty bag. But it's harder to understand why we can't seem to stop eating\u2014even when we know better. When we want so badly to say \"no,\" why do we continue to reach for food? Dr. David Kessler, the dynamic former FDA commissioner who reinvented the food label and tackled the tobacco industry, now reveals how the food industry has hijacked the brains of millions of Americans. The result? America's number-one public health issue. Dr. Kessler cracks the code of overeating by explaining how our bodies and minds are changed when we consume foods that contain sugar, fat, and salt. Food manufacturers create products by manipulating these ingredients to stimulate our appetites, setting in motion a cycle of desire and consumption that ends with a nation of overeaters. The End of Overeating explains for the first time why it is exceptionally difficult to resist certain foods and why it's so easy to overindulge.Dr. Kessler met with top scientists, physicians, and food industry insiders. The End of Overeating uncovers the shocking facts about how we lost control over our eating habits\u2014and how we can get it back. Dr. Kessler presents groundbreaking research, along with what is sure to be a controversial view inside the industry that continues to feed a nation of overeaters\u2014from popular brand manufacturers to advertisers, chain restaurants, and fast food franchises.For the millions of people struggling with weight as well as for those of us who simply don't understand why we can't seem to stop eating our favorite foods, Dr. Kessler's cutting-edge investigation offers new insights and helpful tools to help us find a solution.There has never been a more thorough, compelling, or in-depth analysis of why we eat the way we do.",

        "Description": "Since the 1950s, Junior Leagues have published collections of their favorite regional recipes to raise funds for local community development. Not only have these down-home, family-style cookbooks defined what we now call \"comfort food,\" they have also raised tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions and, collectively, sold in excess of 19 million copies.Now, to celebrate volunteerism and the Leagues' approaching 100th birthday, The Association of Junior Leagues International Inc. has collected into a single volume the very best, most popular, and soul-satisfying dishes from over 200 Junior League cookbooks.At one time Junior League cookbooks were better known for convenience-food recipes than for simple, elegant cuisine.

        "Title": "Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games",
        "Authors": "By Castronova, Edward",
        "Description": "From EverQuest to World of Warcraft, online games have evolved from the exclusive domain of computer geeks into an extraordinarily lucrative staple of the entertainment industry. People of all ages and from all walks of life now spend thousands of hours\u2014and dollars\u2014partaking in this popular new brand of escapism. But the line between fantasy and reality is starting to blur. Players have created virtual societies with governments and economies of their own whose currencies now trade against the dollar on eBay at rates higher than the yen. And the players who inhabit these synthetic worlds are starting to spend more time online than at their day jobs.In Synthetic Worlds, Edward Castronova offers the first comprehensive look at the online game industry, exploring its implications for business and culture alike. He starts with the players, giving us a revealing look into the everyday lives of the gamers\u2014outlining what they do in their synthetic worlds and why. He then describes the economies inside these worlds to show how they might dramatically affect real world financial systems, from potential disruptions of markets to new business horizons. Ultimately, he explores the long-term social consequences of online games: If players can inhabit worlds that are more alluring and gratifying than reality, then how can the real world ever compete? Will a day ever come when we spend more time in these synthetic worlds than in our own? Or even more startling, will a day ever come when such questions no longer sound alarmist but instead seem obsolete?With more than ten million active players worldwide\u2014and with Microsoft and Sony pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into video game development\u2014online games have become too big to ignore.Synthetic Worlds spearheads our efforts to come to terms with this virtual reality and its concrete effects.\u201cIlluminating. . . . Castronova\u2019s analysis of the economics of fun is intriguing. Virtual-world economies are designed to make the resulting game interesting and enjoyable for their inhabitants. Many games follow a rags-to-riches storyline, for example. But how can all the players end up in the top 10%? Simple: the upwardly mobile human players need only be a subset of the world's population. An underclass of computer-controlled 'bot' citizens, meanwhile, stays poor forever. Mr. Castronova explains all this with clarity, wit, and a merciful lack of academic jargon.\u201d\u2014The Economist\u201cSynthetic Worlds is a surprisingly profound book about the social, political, and economic issues arising from the emergence of vast multiplayer games on the Internet. What Castronova has realized is that these games, where players contribute considerable labor in exchange for things they value, are not merely like real economies, theyare real economies, displaying inflation, fraud, Chinese sweatshops, and some surprising in-game innovations.\u201d\u2014Tim Harford,Chronicle of Higher Education",

The meanness gland in her heart and the crevices full of questions in her brain make running away from Hard Pan, California (population 43), the rock-bottom only choice she has.  It's all Brigitte's fault -- for wanting to go back to France. Guardians are supposed to stay put and look after girls in their care! Instead Lucky is sure that she'll be abandoned to some orphanage in Los Angeles where her beloved dog, HMS Beagle, won't be allowed. She'll have to lose her friends Miles, who lives on cookies, and Lincoln, future U.S. president (maybe) and member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. Just as bad, she'll have to give up eavesdropping on twelve-step anonymous programs where the interesting talk is all about Higher Powers. Lucky needs her own -- and quick.  But she hadn't planned on a dust storm.  Or needing to lug the world's heaviest survival-kit backpack into the desert.",

        "Description": "Love. Of all the virtues that have been passed on to us through the ages, from the great poets to the saints and scholars, throughout history and literature, love is the one virtue that we as a society cannot live without.The ability to love well and to love wisely is the most important trait that parents can pass on to their children. As children grow, the longing to share this love as well as receive it will remain strong throughout their lives. Bestselling author Andrew M. Greeley and his sister, Dr. Mary G. Durkin have complied a beautiful and inspiring anthology that will help us comprehend this the most important of virtues and also help us express and understand what it means to love, and how to love wisely. The Book of Love is a perfect gift for a parent to give to a child, for relatives or friends to share, or for those who are coming to know this virtue in all its glory. People of all nations, creeds, colors, and denominations will appreciate this treasury of essays, poems, stories, and songs reflecting the one human need that has remained constant: Love.It has been written about in the Bible, and it was passed down orally in myth and legend. It was discussed by the Chinese philosopher Confucius and in the Koran, and it inspired great works of literature and the pages of popular fiction. The Book of Love is a testament to the enduring nature of our own good, a good expressed through the human bond. In the tradition of William J. Bennett's The Book of Virtue, The Book of Love is a collection to be treasured, and shared, but most of all, it will guide us to express and to pass on the greatest of life's virtues: Love.",

        "Description": "The Crisis That Rocked a Country and a Company...In April 2004, an illegally leaked U.S. Army report thrust CACI, an information technology company, into the international spotlight by casting suspicion on a CACI employee for being \"either directly or indirectly responsible\" for the mistreatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. At the same time, pictures from the abuses were shown on national television and tarnished anyone associated with Abu Ghraib--including CACI.What ensued was a media frenzy rarely seen by any company in recent decades. The media twisted the unsupported allegations into a guilty verdict without regard for the facts or the truth, creating a damning public perception of CACI. Our Good Name recounts how CACI battled to defend itself against erroneous and malicious reports by a rampaging media, how it responded to the wide-ranging government investigations, and how it overcame misplaced anger and criticism that put the company's dedicated employees and excellent reputation--even it's future--at risk.Faced with constant accusations, exaggerations, and false reports, CACI refused to allow the media storm and uninformed opportunists to drag it down. The company condemned the behavior depicted in the infamous prison photos. If any employee had been culpable of any wrongdoing, the company would respond forcefully and accordingly, but only adhering to the rule of law. There would be no witch hunts, no lynch mobs, and no kangaroo courts.Spearheaded by its long-time leader, chairman, president, and CEO Dr. J. Phillip London, the company mounted a concentrated campaign to address the allegations and make the facts known. CACI used innovative methods of crisis management and consistent communications to push back against the distortions and mistakes. CACI would also rely upon its long-established, proven culture of ethics and integrity to direct its activities and set the record straight.Our Good Name is CACI's story of facing one of the biggest scandals in recent history...and coming out honorably with its head high.",

Things have been different for Special Agent Lila Black too: tortured and magic-scarred by elves, rebuilt by humans into a half-robot, part-AI, nuclear-fueled walking arsenal, and carrying the essence of a dead elfin necromancer in her chest, sometimes she has trouble figuring out who she is. And a mission to the world of the fae may not help her work it out. The fae are beautiful, glamorous, exotic, and talented, ruled by their king and queen\u2019s summer and winter courts. Their inventions make food taste better, make beer divine, and bring sparkle and mischief to the world\u2013but that\u2019s only the surface. And Lila is being sent in at the deep end, to the deepest, darkest levels of Faerie: on the primal level, nothing about the fae is glamorous at all. In a winter-locked, raw, and primitive world, Lila has to deal with the fae at their most basic levels, as tricksters and dealmakers\u2013and the only deals worth making are bloody ones. If Lila\u2019s quest is to succeed, and if she is ever to escape Faerie, the right question must be asked, the right sacrifice must be made, and the right quarry must be hunted down on the winter solstice. All of which is difficult, when the only aides Lila brought to Faerie are her friends . . .

        "Authors": "By Bethell, Tom",
        "Description": "\"If the globe is warming, is mankind responsible, or is the sun?\" Such a statement does not appear out of place in Bethell's entertaining account of how modern science is politically motivated and in desperate need of oversight. Bethell writes in a compulsively readable style, and although he provides legitimate insight into the potential benefits of nuclear power and hormesis, some readers will be turned off when he attempts to disprove global warming and especially evolution. Throughout the book, Bethell makes questionable claims about subjects as varied as AIDS (\"careful U.S. studies had already shown that at least a thousand sexual contacts are needed to achieve heterosexual transmission of the virus\") and extinction (\"It is not possible definitely to attribute any given extinction to human activity\"), and backs up his arguments with references to the music magazine SPIN and thriller-writer Michael Crichton. Ironically, Bethell ends up proving his own premise by producing a highly politicized account of how liberal intellectuals and unchecked government agencies have created a \"white-coated priesthood\" whose lust for grant money has driven them to produce fearsome (but in Bethell's view, false) tales of ozone destruction and AIDS pandemics. In the end, this book is unlikely to sway readers who aren't already in Bethell's ideological camp, as any points worthy of discussion get lost in the glut of unsourced claims that populate this latest installment of \"The Politically Incorrect Guide\" series.",

In fact, the two authors largely dispel the myth of Bush's supposedly deficient IQ. But, more importantly, they lay bare the story of how Karl Rove may be the most powerful man in America. It's a compelling story told by two veteran Texas journalists who don't need a briefing packet to understand the men they're writing about.\" \u2014Philip Bruce, KCET/PBS Television, Los AngelesThe most powerful individual in the United States may not be George W. Bush. It is probably Karl Rove, the President's brilliant advisor. Who is this man and how did he acquire so much power? Having watched in awe for over fifteen years as they reported on the rise of Karl Rove, Moore and Slater expose the brutal and sometimes morally questionable, but invariably effective ways in which Karl Rove?and America's political system\u2014actually operate.",

Holidays and other special occasions seem to intensify the pain. Whether the occasion is Christmas or Easter, a birthday or anniversary, these celebrations force the bereaved to again face the reality of a loved one's absence. Susan Zonnebelt-Smeenge and Robert C. De Vries know firsthand the sorrow of bereavement: Both lost a spouse. Yet as they faced their pain and gleaned insights from their professions--Susan is a psychologist, Robert, a minister--they found renewed richness on special days that once brought heartache. In The Empty Chair, the authors share a comforting blend of emotional support, spiritual guidance, and personal experience to help readers honor their loved one on important days. Those who support the bereaved--mental-health professionals, pastors, funeral home staff, and others--will also appreciate this book for its reflective yet practical approach.",

        "Description": "In this heartrending and inspiring novel set against the gorgeous, vast landscape of South Africa under apartheid, award-winning playwright Pamela Gien tells the story of two families\u2013one black, one white\u2013separated by racism, connected by love. Even at the age of six, lively, inquisitive Elizabeth Grace senses she\u2019s a child of privilege, \u201ca lucky fish.\u201d Soothing her worries by raiding the sugar box, she scampers up into the sheltering arms of the lilac-blooming syringa tree growing behind the family\u2019s suburban Johannesburg home.Lizzie\u2019s closest ally and greatest love is her Xhosa nanny, Salamina. Deeper and more elemental than any traditional friendship, their fierce devotion to each other is charged and complicated by Lizzie\u2019s mother, who suffers from creeping melancholy, by the stresses of her father\u2019s medical practice, which is segregated by law, and by the violence, injustice, and intoxicating beauty of their country. In the social and racial upheavals of the 1960s, Lizzie\u2019s eyes open to the terror and inhumanity that paralyze all the nation\u2019s cultures\u2013Xhosa, Zulu, Jew, English, Boer. Pass laws requiring blacks to carry permission papers for white areas and stringent curfews have briefly created an orderly state\u2013but an anxious one. Yet Lizzie\u2019s home harbors its own set of rules, with hushed midnight gatherings, clandestine transactions, and the girl\u2019s special task of protecting Salamina\u2019s newborn child\u2013a secret that, because of the new rules, must never be mentioned outside the walls of the house.As the months pass, the contagious spirit of change sends those once underground into the streets to challenge the ruling authority. And when this unrest reaches a social and personal climax, the unthinkable will happen and forever change Lizzie\u2019s view of the world. When The Syringa Tree opened off-Broadway in 2001, theater critics and audiences alike embraced the play, and it won many awards. Pamela Gien has superbly deepened the story in this new novel, giving a personal voice to the horrors and hopes of her homeland. Written with lyricism, passion, and life-affirming redemption, this compelling story shows the healing of the heart of a young woman and the soul of a sundered nation.Praise:A gripping first novel in the tradition of such great southern African writers as Nadine Gordimer and Doris Lessing.\u00a0Spare beautiful prose\u00a0builds to\u00a0an unforgettable climax.\u00a0--BOOKLIST, starred review\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pamela Gien's\u00a0novel is impressively affecting.\u00a0She is a wonder.
