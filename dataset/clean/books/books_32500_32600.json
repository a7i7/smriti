        "Title": "Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior",
        "Authors": "By Schwartz, Jeffrey M., M.D. and Beyette, Beverly",
        "Description": "An estimated 5 million Americans suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and live diminished lives in which they are compelled to obsess about something or to repeat a similar task over and over. Traditionally, OCD has been treated with Prozac or similar drugs. The problem with medication, aside from its cost, is that 30 percent of people treated don't respond to it, and when the pills stop, the symptoms invariably return.In Brain Lock, Jeffrey M. Schwartz presents a simple four-step method for overcoming OCD that is so effective, it's now used in academic treatment centers throughout the world. Proven by brain-imaging tests to actually alter the brain's chemistry, this method doesn't rely on psychopharmaceuticals. Instead, patients use cognitive self-therapy and behavior modification to develop new patterns of response to their obsessions. In essence, they use the mind to fix the brain. Using the real-life stories of actual patients, Brain Lock explains this revolutionary method and provides readers with the inspiration and tools to free themselves from their psychic prisons and regain control of their lives.",

        "Description": "From the author of the beloved novel Three Junes comes a rich and commanding story about the accidents, both grand and small, that determine our choices in love and marriage. Greenie Duquette, openhearted yet stubborn, devotes most of her passionate attention to her Greenwich Village bakery and her four\u2013year\u2013old son, George. Her husband, Alan, seems to have fallen into a midlife depression, while Walter, a traditional gay man who has become her closest professional ally, is nursing a broken heart.It is at Walter\u2019s restaurant that the visiting governor of New Mexico tastes Greenie\u2019s coconut cake and decides to woo her away from the city to be his chef. For reasons both ambitious and desperate, she accepts\u2014and finds herself heading west without her husband. This impulsive decision will change the course of several lives within and beyond Greenie\u2019s orbit. Alan, alone in New York, must face down his demons; Walter, eager for platonic distraction, takes in his teenage nephew. Yet Walter cannot steer clear of love trouble, and despite his enforced solitude, Alan is still surrounded by women: his powerful sister, an old flame, and an animal lover named Saga, who grapples with demons all her own. As for Greenie, living in the shadow of a charismatic politician leads to a series of unforeseen consequences that separate her from her only child. We watch as folly, chance, and determination pull all these lives together and apart over a year that culminates in the fall of the twin towers at the World Trade Center, an event that will affirm or confound the choices each character has made\u2014or has refused to face.Julia Glass is at her best here, weaving a glorious tapestry of lives and lifetimes, of places and people, revealing the subtle mechanisms behind our most important, and often most fragile, connections to others. In The Whole World Over she has given us another tale that pays tribute to the extraordinary complexities of love.",

The children had little interest in learning, and were sorely lacking in guidance. How would he transform a group of apathetic kids into disciplined, thoughtful, and curious students? He quickly realized that they needed to learn some basic rules. Clark compiled a list of 55 lessons, and soon, his fifth-grade students--who once struggled to read at the third-grade level--were reading at the sixth-grade level . . . and loving it. What's more, they were gaining something crucial-self-respect. Those 55 lessons evolved into what Clark calls The Essential 55--guidelines for living and interacting with others. The Essential 55 will prepare parents and educators to teach students the rules for life--everything from knowing how to say thank you, to acing an interview.",

He shows how we have come to equate consumerism with patriotism and Fox News with objective journalism, and how our culture has become more polarized than ever even as we all shop at the same exact big-box stores. Insightful, hilarious, and critical of both liberals and conservatives, this is one of the smartest and most enjoyable books on American culture in years.",

But the world we live in has. Christians in America have had their complacency shattered and their beliefs challenged. Around the world, the clash of world views has never been more strident. Before all of us, daily, are the realities of life and death, terror and hope, light and darkness, brokeness and healing. We cannot withdraw to the comfort of our santuaries...we must engage. For, if ever there was a time for Christians to be the Body of Christ in the world, it is now.In this new, revised and expanded edition of The Body, Charles Colson revisits the question, \"What is the church and what is its relevance to contemporary culture at large?\" Provocative and insightful,Being the Body inspires us to rise above a stunted \"Jesus and me\" faith to a nobler view of something bigger and grander than ourselves --the glorious, holy vision for which God created the church.",

Frazier drives around \"the rez\" with Le War Lance and other Oglalas as they tell stories, visit relatives, go to powwows and rodeos and package stores, and try to find parts to fix one or another of their on-the-verge-of-working cars.On the Rez considers Indian ideas of freedom and community and equality that are basic to how we view ourselves. Most of all, he examines the Indian idea of heroism-its suffering and its pulse-quickening, public-spirited glory. On the Rez portrays the survival, through toughness and humor, of a great people whose culture has shaped our American identity.",

But now there's been another death, another pretty, young doctor viciously killed in her pristine Manhattan apartment - and a startling link to that long-ago conviction.All fingers point to the convict Julian Vega, no longer so young, out of jail on a technicality, and no longer the eager-to-please youth Loughlin first met in the interrogation room. But this is no open-and-shut case. When Loughlin arranges for a DNA test, the results blow up in his face. Soon there are bulldozers in the graveyard, exhuming twenty-year-old remains and renewing a family's deep-seated mourning. Because there's one thing in this case that Loughlin's now sure of - the blood under the latest victim's fingernails definitely doesn't belong to Julian Vega. It doesn't even belong to a man. It belongs to Allison Wallis, the woman murdered twenty years before.Two men circle each other from opposite sides of the law. Both have something to prove, both are only too aware of their own limitations.",

But when his boss asks him if he would like to go to Iraq, he doesn't have the guts to say no. After signing a 1 million dollar life-insurance policy, studying a tutorial on repairing severed limbs, and spending 20 thousand dollars in camping gear (only to find out that his bright yellow tent makes him a sitting duck), Ayres is embedded with a battalion of gung ho Marines who either shun him or threaten him when he files an unfavorable story. As time goes on, though, he begins to understand them (and his inexplicably enthusiastic fellow war reporters) more and more: Each night of terrifying combat brings, in the morning, something more visceral than he has ever experienced ? the thrill of having won a fight for survival.In the tradition of MASH, Catch-22, and other classics in which irreverence springs from life in extremis, War Reporting for Cowards tells the story of Iraq in a way that is extraordinarily honest, heartfelt, and bitterly hilarious.",

He provides a framework that identifies four distinct roles of human resource professionals: strategic player, administrative expert, employee champion, and change agent. He includes many examples to demonstrate that human resource professionals must operate in all four areas simultaneously in order to contribute fully. He urges a shift of these professionals' mentality from \"what I do\" to \"what I deliver\" and makes specific recommendations for how individuals in human resources can partner with line managers to make organizations more competitive.",

These tiny, neat little lizards with the intense black eyes have suffered the fate of goldfish, as they\u2019ve been marketed by pet shops as cheap, easy care, insect-eating reptiles. In order to keep green anoles thriving in their vivaria, pet owners must approach their husbandry with care and respect: Philippe de Vosjoli\u2019s Green Anoles provides the precise information necessary to reach that goal. The book begins with a chapter about the characteristics and behavior, natural history, and anatomy of green anoles, all of which is critical information for a keep to better understand the needs of his or her pet. As pets, green anoles are best kept in their vivaria and not handled, so the setup of a beautifully landscaped vivarium with proper lighting, heat, humidity, ventilation, and substrate is key. This Advanced Vivarium Systems title offers complete information about housing, feeding and nutrition, diseases and disorders, and breeding as well as how to set up naturalistic vivaria for one or more anoles or a community of anoles and compatible species. The chapter on other anoles recommends some very attractive species for the beginning lizard keeper to expand his anole family, such as the brown anole, big-headed anole, Cuban (or knight) anole, and Jamaican anole. The finale chapter on compatible species includes descriptions and photographs of a half dozen interesting options, such as the flying gecko, pigmy skink, and green tree frog.

        "Description": "In February 1865, the end was clearly in sight for the Confederate government. Lee's defeat at Gettysburg had dashed the hopes of the Confederate army, and Grant's victory at Vicksburg had cut the South in two. An Honorable Defeat is the story of the four months that saw the surrender of the South and the assassination of Lincoln by Southern partisans. It is also the story of two men, antagonists yet political partners, who struggled during this time to achieve their own differing visions for the South: Jefferson Davis, the autocratic president of the Confederate States, who vowed never to surrender whatever the cost; and the practical and warm General John C. Breckinridge, Secretary of War, who hoped pragmatism would save the shattered remnants of the land he loved so dearly. Pulitzer Prize nominee William C. Davis traces the astounding flight of these men, and the entire Confederate cabinet, as they flee south from Richmond by train, then by mule, then on foot. Using original research, he narrates, with dramatic style and clear historical accuracy, the futile quarrels of Davis and Breckinridge as they try to evade bands of Northern pursuers and describes their eventual--and separate--captures. The result is a rich canvas of a time of despair and defeat that is exciting and highly readable, a charged tale full of physical adventure and political battle that sweeps from the marble halls of Richmond to a dingy room in a Havana hotel.",

        "Title": "Ghost Soldiers: The Forgotten Epic Story of World War II's Most Dramatic Mission",
        "Authors": "By Sides, Hampton",
        "Description": "A tense, powerful, grand account of one of the most daring exploits of World War II.On January 28, 1945, 121 hand-selected troops from the elite U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines.  Their mission: March thirty miles in an attempt to rescue 513 American and British POWs who had spent three years in a surreally hellish camp near the city of Cabanatuan.  The prisoners included the last survivors of the Bataan Death March left in the camp, and their extraordinary will to live might soon count for nothing\u2014elsewhere in the Philippines, the Japanese Army had already executed American prisoners as it retreated from the advancing U.S. Army.  As the Rangers stealthily moved through enemy-occupied territory, they learned that Cabanatuan had become a major transshipment point for the Japanese retreat, and instead of facing the few dozen prison guards, they could possibly confront as many as 8,000 battle-hardened enemy troops.Hampton Sides's vivid minute-by-minute narration of the raid and his chronicle of the prisoners' wrenching experiences are masterful.  But Ghost Soldiers is far more than a thrilling battle saga.  Hampton Sides explores the mystery of human behavior under extreme duress\u2014the resilience of the prisoners, who defied the Japanese authorities even as they endured starvation, tropical diseases, and unspeakable tortures; the violent cultural clashes with Japanese guards and soldiers steeped in the warrior ethic of Bushido; the remarkable heroism of the Rangers and Filipino guerrillas; the complex motivations of the U.S. high command, some of whom could justly be charged with abandoning the men of Bataan in 1942; and the nearly suicidal bravado of several spies, including priests and a cabaret owner, who risked their lives to help the prisoners during their long ordeal.At once a gripping depiction of men at war and a compelling story of redemption, Ghost Soldiers joins such landmark books as Flags of Our Fathers, The Greatest Generation, The Rape of Nanking, and D-Day in preserving the legacy of World War II for future generations.",

A bold gambit to destroy America as a world power is well under way.Its architect is Prince Ibrahim al Saud, a member of the Middle East's most influential royal family and the brilliant head of a multi-billion-dollar global conglomerate. With his vast, unparalleled wealth, he bankrolls and directs the most lethal terrorist groups on earth to launch the most murderous attack ever conceived. His henchman is Rolf Ulrich Reichardt, once a feared agent of the East German Stasi, now a paid assassin, secure in the conviction that raw, cold power is the force closest to divinity itself.Against Ibrahim and his allies stand two veteran American operatives readers will remember from The Enemy Within: U.S. Army Colonel Peter Thorn and FBI Special Agent Helen Gray. Together, they follow the faint traces of Ibrahim's scheme from Russia, across Europe, and finally home to America - all the while on the run from the very people they're fighting to protect.",

Terry, who has forty-seven bodies in his church that need burying, has just heard one confession too many. After exacting from them a chilling penance, Fr. Terry has to get out of Africa - pronto.Now Terry is coming home to Detroit, where a five-year-old tax-fraud indictment is hanging over him. Is Terry Dunn really a priest? He certainly doesn't act like one. A fugitive felon on two continents, Terry is being pursued by a cigarette-smuggling cohort, who rolled over on Terry to save jail time...yet still demands his share of the money. But Debbie Dewey has other plans for Terry. She's just been sprung from a three-year fall at Sawgrass Correctional for aggravated assault...and is now trying to make it as a stand-up comic. Debbie and Terry hit it off beautifully. They have the same sense of humor and similar goals: Both of them want to raise a whole lot of cash. Terry, for the children of Rwanda; Debbie, to score off a guy who owes her sixty-seven thousand dollars. It's Debbie who keeps prying, until she learns the bizarre truth about Terry; Debbie who sells him on going in together for a much bigger payoff than either could manage alone. That is unless the priest is working a con of his own.",

        "Description": "\u201cMay this very important and enticing book find its way into the hearts of readers   near and far so that it can perform its mysterious and healing alchemy for the benefit   of all.\u201d \u2014John Kabat-Zinn, author of Wherever You Go, There You Are and Professor   of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School The Transformative Power   of Mindfulness Alchemists sought to transform lead into gold. In the same way, says   Tara Bennett-Goleman, we all have the natural ability to turn our moments of confusion   or emotional pain into insightful clarity. Emotional Alchemy maps the mind and shows   how, according to recent advances in cognitive therapy, most of what troubles us   falls into ten basic emotional patterns, including fear of abandonment, social exclusion   (the feeling that we don\u2019t belong), and vulnerability (the feeling that some catastrophe   will occur).  This remarkable book also teaches us how we can free ourselves of such   patterns and replace them with empathy for ourselves and others through the simple   practice of mindfulness, an awareness that lets us see things as they truly are without   distortion or judgment. Emotional Alchemy provides an insightful explanation of how   mindfulness can change not only our lives, but the very structure of our brains,   giving us the freedom to be more creative and alive.  Here is a beautifully rendered   work full of Buddhist wisdom and stories  of how people have used mindfulness to   conquer their self-defeating habits. The result is a whole new way of approaching   our relationships, work, and internal lives.",
