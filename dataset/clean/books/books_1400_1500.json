        "Authors": "By Conrad, Charlie (EDT) and Keen, Sam",
        "Description": "The acclaimed author of Fire in the Belly presents an exhilarating memoir of his late-blooming love affair with the flying trapeze--and a provocative look at the potential it offers for growth and transformation.Since he first experienced the joy and freedom of flight while swinging from trees as a boy in Alabama and Tennessee, Sam Keen dreamed of being able to fly. But it was only when, at age sixty-one, he happened upon a trapeze training program at the San Francisco School of Circus Arts that he took up the quest in earnest. After ascending to the platform thirty-one feet in the air and grasping the trapeze bar, Keen dove into the ocean of emptiness above the net, lost in the pleasure of swinging. Returning to the trapeze again and again, he gradually developed the poise and confidence that allowed him to release himself from the bar and soar--airborne--into the hands of a catcher. Having tasted the elation of actual flight, Keen's childhood dream became a passion and a vehicle for exploring the challenges and dilemmas of life.In Learning to Fly, Keen traces the life journey that led him to respond to the lure of the trapeze late in his life and shares what his five years of intensive practice have taught him about living more intensely and passionately. He also recounts how his recognition of this art form's transcendent powers led him to launch Upward Bound, a trapeze workshop for anyone facing deeply rooted fears.An unprecedented adventure of the soul and psyche, Learning to Fly teaches us to soar on the wings of possibility as we watch Keen and his students progress through breathtaking exercises. As he describes take-offs and knee hangs and thrilling mid-air catches, Keen imparts moving revelations about risk-taking, trust, bravado, true strength, falling, and letting go. Guiding us on a remarkable inner journey through the \"circus of the mind,\" Learning to Fly reveals the grace of ascending in body and spirit--and living with levity.A film documentary of Learning to Fly is also available on video, produced by Quest Productions based in Berkeley, CA.",

Rachael Hale's signature style catches the eye of everyone who comes across it. Featuring 101 color photographs of Chihuahuas, Great Danes, and everything in between, 101 SALIVATIONS presents dogs in all sorts of wonderful poses that bring out their most endearing characteristics. Rachael's secret to capturing a dog's soul is to focus on his eyes-whether they are wide and shining, or heavy-lidded, in the throes of slumber. Within this book we can see the soul of our own best buddies staring back at us. The book is peppered with humorous and touching quotations from well-known authors such as A.A. Milne and Fran Lebowitz. Following in the paw prints of 101 SALIVATIONS, Rachael Hale's 101 CATACLYSMS is a charming and playful tribute to the world's most popular pet. This collection features 101 images of magnificent felines. Hale's special rapport with animals has allowed her to capture the essence of her subjects. You will see it in the bald-faced cheekiness of Hilander, the sphinx; in the sassiness of Puffy, the Persian ball of fluff; and in the playfulness of Yabba Dabba Doo, the British shorthair. 101 CATACLYSMS also contains quotations from well-known personalities-such as James Herriot's ``Cats are the connoisseurs of comfort''-that will tickle the reader as they peruse this gem of a book.",

Ambassador Joseph Wilson recounts more than two decades of foreign service to our country in this unprecedented look at the life of an American diplomat and an unabashed account of policies that sometimes succeeded and sometimes failed. As the last American official to meet with Saddam before Desert Storm, Wilson successfully parried the dictator's threats to use American hostages as human shields against U.S. bombing. Yet today he finds himself battling threats from his own government because he called a lie a lie. When President Bush alleged that Iraq had pursued uranium from Africa for its nuclear weapons program, Wilson could not stand silent. He had traveled to Niger the previous year and found no evidence to support the president's claim. To intimidate Wilson, senior administration officials disclosed the undercover status of Wilson's wife, CIA operative Valerie Plame, to the press, putting her life in danger. Rather than backing down, Wilson persistently criticized the way the administration misled the nation into war. Now he continues his fight in this groundbreaking book by revealing the perils bred by the war-hungry regime in the White House.",

Rescuing the infant from certain death, Lord Geoffroy adopts her as his only child, heir to the fabulous Love Hall fortune. He names her Rose in memory of his long-dead, endlessly mourned sister and gives her a childhood of unparalleled gaiety and unstinting pleasure.But every house has a secret, and as Rose approaches adolescence, the secret of Love Hall becomes impossible to hide. As much as Lord Geoffroy wanted a daughter, the baby he brought home is, in fact, a boy. Lace petticoats and expensive frocks cannot disguise what blooms just beneath. Lady Rose has never been a girl, and it is Rose himself who is most bewildered by the revelation.As a flock of outraged relatives circles, each clamoring for a share of the family riches, Rose has no choice but to flee. He must abandon the luxury and safety of his beloved home and travel halfway around the world to begin to understand who he really is - and to unlock the secret of his rightful place.",

        "Description": "Eating right is the most crucial step that men and women of any age can take to protect their overall health. Yet most consumers remain confused about nutrition, and newspapers and magazines often get the facts wrong. How many carrots will supply your daily dose of beta carotene? How can you boost your iron intake without increasing the amount of red meat in your diet? Which has more vitamin C, an orange or a glass of orange juice? Are all shellfish high in cholesterol? Here are straightforward - and often surprising - answers to these and hundreds of other questions on how to choose and use foods for maximum taste and nutritional value.This comprehensive, quick-reference encyclopedia covers every type of whole, fresh food found in supermarkets, specialty shops, and health food stores. It also presents the latest information on what makes up a healthy diet and on the connection between diet and disease prevention.Each entry shows you how to select the freshest high-quality foods, and how to store and cook them (Did you know that thumping a melon is useless as a test for ripeness? Or that you should never store potatoes in the refrigerator?) Highlighted nutritional profiles display key nutrients at a glance. Throughout the book, you'll find charts and boxes filled with tips, advice, and fascinating facts. And there are literally hundreds of delicious serving suggestions for main dishes, snacks, desserts, and more - all proving that a healthy diet isn't a matter of limiting your choices, but of increasing the variety of foods you eat.Every fact draws on the expertise of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley - an institution at the forefront of examining the link between diet and health, and the authority behind the nation's leading health newsletter, the University of California at Berkeley Wellness Letter. The result is an up-to-date reference source that you can turn to with the utmost confidence.",

Ward provides a gripping journey through the turbulent history of the region that has come to symbolize America around the world. Drawing upon hundreds of letters, diaries, memoirs, and journals as well as the latest scholarship. The West chronicles the arrival of wave after wave of newcomers from every direction of the compass, each of which invested the harsh but majestic western landscape with its own myths and desires and dreams.The cast is as rich and diverse as the western landscape itself - explorers and soldiers and Indian warriors, settlers and railroad builders and gaudy showmen. Coronado and Custer, Jesse James and Chief Joseph and Brigham Young and Buffalo Bill are all here. But so are scores of lesser-known westerners whose stories are no less compelling - a Chinese ditchdiggger and a rich Mexican landowner, a forty-niner from Chile and a Texas cowboy born in Britain, a woman missionary to the Indians who loathed the West and a Wellesley graduate who loved it in spite of everything it did to her and her family.The West explores the tensions between whites and the native peoples they sought to displace, but it also encompasses the Hispanic experience in the West, from the time of the conquistadors to the transformation of a Mexican-American village called Los Angeles into the region's major metropolis; the lives of Chinese immigrants who called the region \"Gold Mountain\"; and the ordeals of freed slaves from the South who sought a better life homesteading on the Great Plains.With essays by distinguished historians and writers about the West: Dayton Duncan, John Mack Faragher, David G. Gutierrez, Julie Roy Jeffrey, Patricia Nelson Limerick, N. Scott Momaday, T. H. Watkins, and Richard White.",

This blanced and highly successful collaboration of scholars with a theater director solves the contemporary problems of translating and staging the Orestia, which originally was written to be performed in Athens in the first half of the fifth century B.C.\u00a0While remaning faithful to the original Greek, Grene and O'Flaherty embrace a strong and adventurous English style, vivid and visceral. The language of this extraordinary translation, immediately accessible to a theater audience, speaks across the centuries. Premiered at Chicago's Court Theater in 1986 under Rudall's direction, the stage adaptation of the Orestia proved eminently playable. \u00a0This new adaptation of the orestia offers a brilliant demonstration of how clearly defined goals (here, the actor's needs) can inspire translators to produce fresh, genuine, accessible dramatic texts. The resulting work provides complete and accurate texts for those who cannot read the original Greek, and it transforms the Orestia into an effective modern stage play. With interpretive introductions written by the translators and director, this new version will be welcomed by teachers of translation courses, by students of Greek and world drama in general, and by theater professionals.",

They weren't doing business; Drover was just catching up with some guys he knew from growing up in the streets. But a U.S. attorney with ulterior motives got him fired from his paper, and Drover's life was upended.Now he lives in Santa Cruz, trading stories and killing time at a local bar with a crew of good-natured, trustworthy lazybones. To make ends meet, he works off and on for Fox Vernon, a legendary Las Vegas oddsmaker. Vernon needs a scout, a busybody - and so Drover makes a living by using his intuitions and sports world knowledge, talking his way into locker rooms, gambling dens, mobsters' and managers' offices, traveling around the country in pursuit of sports world info that might affect the odds on Sunday's game.Drover is called into an investigation of Homer White, whose heavy-hitting baseball career with the Chicago Cubs has gone into a slump after leg injuries. Homer's suspected of gambling - easy enough for Drover to check up on, given his above- and below-board contacts. But as Drover gets more of the lowdown, the picture becomes more deadly: Some people want to sabotage Homer's career - including his bitter ex-wife. Some want to save it - including his beautiful rehab nurse, Helen Brown. Trying to learn the hidden story, Drover steps into a knotty web of threats and violent passions and finds himself again under suspicion - and under the gun.The third in Bill Granger's best-selling Drover series, Drover and the Designated Hitter comes through again with Granger's vivid panorama of modern sports world detail and Drover's caustic, seen-it-all wit.",

Distinguished historian Stephen E. Ambrose portrays the faces of courage and heroism, fear and determination\u2014what Eisenhower called \u201cthe fury of an aroused democracy\u201d\u2014that shaped the victory of the citizen soldiers whom Hitler had disparaged.Drawing on more than 1,400 interviews with American, British, Canadian, French, and German veterans, Ambrose reveals how the original plans for the invasion had to be abandoned, and how enlisted men and junior officers acted on their own initiative when they realized that nothing was as they were told it would be.  The action begins at midnight, June 5/6, when the first British and American airborne troops jumped into France. It ends at midnight June 6/7. Focusing on those pivotal twenty-four hours, it moves from the level of Supreme Commander to that of a French child, from General Omar Bradley to an American paratrooper, from Field Marshal Montgomery to a German sergeant.

This book, written by the relentless reporter who first broke the story of the Mideast connection, is filled with new revelations about the case and explains in full detail the complete, and so far untold, story behind the failed investigation-why the FBI closed the door, what further evidence exists to prove the Iraqi connection, why it has been ignored, and what makes it more relevant now than ever. Told with a gripping narrative style and rock-solid investigative journalism and vetted by men such as former CIA director James Woolsey, Davis's piercing account is the first book to set the record straight about what really happened April 19, 1995.",

Rachael Hale's signature style catches the eye of everyone who comes across it. Featuring 101 color photographs of Chihuahuas, Great Danes, and everything in between, 101 SALIVATIONS presents dogs in all sorts of wonderful poses that bring out their most endearing characteristics. Rachael's secret to capturing a dog's soul is to focus on his eyes-whether they are wide and shining, or heavy-lidded, in the throes of slumber. Within this book we can see the soul of our own best buddies staring back at us. The book is peppered with humorous and touching quotations from well-known authors such as A.A. Milne and Fran Lebowitz. Following in the paw prints of 101 SALIVATIONS, Rachael Hale's 101 CATACLYSMS is a charming and playful tribute to the world's most popular pet. This collection features 101 images of magnificent felines. Hale's special rapport with animals has allowed her to capture the essence of her subjects. You will see it in the bald-faced cheekiness of Hilander, the sphinx; in the sassiness of Puffy, the Persian ball of fluff; and in the playfulness of Yabba Dabba Doo, the British shorthair. 101 CATACLYSMS also contains quotations from well-known personalities-such as James Herriot's ``Cats are the connoisseurs of comfort''-that will tickle the reader as they peruse this gem of a book.",

        "Description": "Ancient medical science told us our minds and bodies are one. So did philosophers of old. Now, modern science and new research are helping us to understand these connections. In Healing and the Mind, Bill Moyers talks with physicians, scientists, therapists, and patients - people who are taking a new look at the meaning of sickness and health. In a series of fascinating and provocative interviews, he discusses their search for answers to perplexing questions: How do emotions translate into chemicals in our bodies? How do thoughts and feelings influence health? How can we collaborate with our bodies to encourage healing?Healing and the Mind travels from small private clinics to large public hospitals to examine how advances in mind/body medicine are being applied on a day-to-day level in the hurried and technology-driven world of modern medicine. From neonatal care to geriatrics, from day surgery to the treatment of chronic illness, medical professionals are finding that when they practice the \"new medicine,\" their patients heal faster, leave the hospital sooner, and do better once they get home.Bill Moyers and David Grubin also travel to the People's Republic of China. There they explore the implications of that country's fusion of Western practices with traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, massage, herbal potions, and the mysterious concept called chi. They take an intimate look at alternate therapy programs, including a Massachusetts medical center that combines Eastern meditation with Western therapy in the treatment of ailments as diverse as hypertension and chronic back pain. And they visit a California retreat where cancer patients help each other discover that healing can occur even when a cure is impossible.With the incisive style that has made Bill Moyers's skills as an interviewer legendary, and the dynamic interplay of text and art that has made his previous books international bestsellers, Healing and the Mind is a landmark work, destined to influence how America thinks about sickness and health.",

        "Title": "Wild Animals and American Environmental Ethics",
        "Authors": "By Mighetto, Lisa",
        "Description": "Long before the Endangered Species Act and the spotted owl controversy, American conservationists debated the ethics of wildlife protection.  Although all were alarmed by the rapid destruction of game species in the late 1800s, some sought to preserve animals for their aesthetic and material benefit to humans, while others believed it was wrong to mistreat any wild creature.  Wild Animals and American Environmental Ethics shows how the latter view evolved into the animal rights activism of today.  Lisa Mighetto examines portrayals of wildlife in popular literature dating from the nineteenth century, revealing how early conservationists looked for evidence of morality in animals that would make them more acceptable to the American public.  Arguing that animals should be protected because they think, feel, and act in a manner similar to humans, some went so far as to claim that these creatures have rights.    Not all wild animals readily conformed to the new image.  The first conservationists did not extend their ethics to predators or \"varmints,\" and supported government efforts to wipe them out.  By describing how animal lovers gradually came to advocate protection of even these creatures, Mighetto traces the development of modern ecological values and the biocentric perspective.  Americans now stand at a critical point in wildlife protection, wielding the threat of extinction over numerous species.  Mighetto places arguments regarding wildlife protection in historical perspective and thus helps us evaluate our inherited attitudes and assumptions about the animal world.  Enhancing the text are more than fifty illustrations that demonstrate the interaction between humans and wildlife over the last century.",

        "Title": "The Color of Truth: McGeorge Bundy and William Bundy: Brothers in Arms",
        "Authors": "By Bird, Kai",
        "Description": "The Color of Truth is the definitive biography of McGeorge Bundy and William Bundy, two of \"the best and the brightest\" who advised presidents about peace and war during the most dangerous years of the Cold War. The Bundy brothers embodied all the idealism and hubris that animated American foreign policy in the decades after World War II. They will be remembered forever as anti-communist liberals who, despite their grave doubts about sending Americans to fight in Southeast Asia, became key architects of America's war in Vietnam.  Kai Bird, the author of The Chairman, the acclaimed biography of John J. McCloy, brilliantly recreates the world of Boston Brahmin privilege in which the Bundy brothers were reared to govern. Educated at Groton, Yale and Harvard, Mac and Bill Bundy were prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Henry Stimson, Dean Acheson and Justice Felix Frankfurter, and their friends and admirers included Walter Lippmann, Joseph Alsop and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Bill played a major role in the supersecret ULTRA code-breaking project that proved invaluable to the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany. Mac, a key military aide, was present at D-day and later wrote Stimson's influential but misleading essay explaining Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb.  In the 1950s, both brothers became ensnared in Senator Joseph McCarthy's witchhunts against suspected communists in government and academia. As dean of Harvard College, Mac fought to protect his tenured faculty while sacrificing junior scholars who refused to \"name names\" to the FBI. Bill, a high-ranking CIA official, saw his career nearly destroyed when McCarthy learned he had contributed money to Alger Hiss's defense fund. Bill's refusal to testify before the senator's committee was a turning point in the battle against McCarthyism.  The brothers reached the apex of the national security establishment under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Kennedy appointed Mac Bundy to be his national security adviser, and Bill Bundy moved into senior positions at the Pentagon and the State Department. One or the other was involved in many of the triumphs and deceits of the Kennedy years, including the Bay of Pigs fiasco, plots to eliminate Fidel Castro and the Cuban Missile Crisis. But it was their role in guiding the nation to war in Vietnam that engulfed them in controversy and indelibly marked them as failed figures in American history.  At every stage of the war -- from the assassination of South Vietnamese president Diem in 1963 to the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, from the bombing campaign of Operation Rolling Thunder to President Johnson's July 1965 decision to send hundreds of thousands of U.S. combat troops to Vietnam -- the Bundy brothers were present, urging a policy of gradual escalation. Long after Johnson had dismissed their warning that Vietnam could become a \"white man's war\" on the Asian mainland, the Bundys remained loyal to their liberal president, who was determined not to allow right-wing critics to accuse him of losing another Asian country to communism. Even after Mac left the government in 1966 to become the controversial president of the Ford Foundation, he remained silent on the war. Bill stayed on in Washington until 1969, prosecuting a war he knew was unwinnable.  Based on nearly a hundred interviews with the Bundy brothers, their families and colleagues, and on thousands of pages of archival documents -- including some White House memos that remain classified -- Bird's account contains dramatic new information that alters the history of the Vietnam War. Like the bestselling The Wise Men, this dual biography is both an inside account of the making of U.S. foreign policy in an era of nuclear weapons and a stunning group portrait of the heirs of the Wise Men -- including Robert McNamara, George Ball and Robert Kennedy -- and the presidents they served.
