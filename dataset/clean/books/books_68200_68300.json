Governor Howard Dean argues that you have the power not just to defeat George W. Bush in this election but to change the future course of America.  You Have the Power is an energetic and detailed guide to restoring American democracy. It exposes the radical extremism of today's \"mainstream\" Republicans and shows Democrats how to be Democrats again. By reigniting hope, by tapping into the energy and ideals of the American people, Dean writes, the Democrats can restore America's strength and standing at home and abroad.  Drawing on his experience in the 2004 presidential election and the hope and inspiration of the people he met on the campaign trail, Dean shows how real people -- ordinary Americans like himself -- can come together to take their party, the political process, and their country back.",

This collection, illustrated with classic art from the animated series includes the comical retelling of 25 classics such as Pinocchio (who starred in his own variety show \"The Pinocchio Doody Show\"), Jack and the Beanstalk (did you know that Jack grew a beanstalk in the outfield so he could catch fly balls for his baseball team?), or King Midas (who became a dentist so he could give his patients gold fillings). This satirical humor loved for so long by so many, is a must-have for fans of the show and anyone who loves classic fairy tales--with a twist.",

        "Authors": "By Kazin, Alfred",
        "Description": "An American Procession is a study, on the largest scale, of the major American writers at work during the historically and literarily crucial century that began in the early 1830s, when Ralph Waldo Emerson founded a national literature on the basis of a metaphysical revolution, and ended on the eve of the 1930s with the triumph of modernism and the critical recognition of the \u201cpostponed power\u201d of those who had been modern before their time.  These one hundred years encompassed a period of unprecedented expansion and promise in the United States, and the work of our novelists, essayists, poets, and historians was the mirror of the nation\u2019s spirit. The thirty years preceding the Civil War produced the transcendental idealism of Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman and the dark romanticism of Hawthorne, Poe, and Melville. In the years just after World War I, modernism reached its exemplary form in the work of Eliot, Pound, Hemingway, Dos Passos, and Fitzgerald, and between the two wars emerged the great realists: Mark Twain, Henry James, Crane, and Dreiser. It is through an exploration of the lives and works of these writers\u2014together with Emily Dickinson, William James, Henry Adams, and Faulkner\u2014that Kazin maps out a great literary procession shaped by individual genius, by history, and by the implacable American sense of self.   With each writer, Alfred Kazin illuminates for us the work, the influences that informed it, and its influence on the work of others. Each figure seems revitalized for us by Kazin\u2019s acuity and powerful sympathy for his subject. An American Procession, with its intellectual energy, its clarity and breadth, is the brilliantly executed capstone of Kazin\u2019s already illustrious career and will stand as the most important study of American literature in our time.",

        "Description": "Lidia's Italian TableLIDIA MATTICCHIO BASTIANICH\"Let me invite you on a journey with me from my childhood ...\" beckons Lidia Bastianich, hostess of the national public television series Lidia's Italian Table. And what an incredible journey it proves to be. Lidia's Italian Table is overflowing with glorious Italian food, highlighted by Lidia's personal collection of recipes accumulated since her childhood in Istria, located in northern Italy on the Adriatic Sea. Hearty and heartwarming Italian fare is what Lidia understands best, and each chapter of this gorgeous cookbook is infused with Lidia's warm memories of a lifetime of eating and cooking Italian style. Since good Italian food is based on good ingredients, Lidia includes an eloquent discourse on those products that are the cornerstones of Italian cuisine: olives (and their green-golden oil), Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, salt, porcini mushrooms, truffles, tomato paste, and hot peppers. She also explains the importance of regional wines and grappa (in flavors from honey to dried fig) in the Italian food experience. Her recipes are filled with these Italian delicacies--Fennel, Olive, and Citrus Salad; Tagliatelle with Porcini Mushroom Sauce; Seared Rabbit Loin over Arugula with Truffle Dressing; Asparagus Gratin with Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese-, and Zabaglione with Barolo Wine. Lidia explores every corner of Italian cuisine: from fresh and dry pasta to gnocchi and risotto to game and shellfish, all of which Lidia transforms into exceptional Italian dishes. But that is only the beginning. There are Italian soups to savor, like hearty minestre, bread-enriched zuppe, and the light and flavorful brodi. Polenta's delicious versatility is revealed through Polenta, Gorgonzola, and Savoy Cabbage Torte and White Creamy Polenta with Fresh Plums. And Lidia's luscious dolci, or desserts, invite your indulgence with Sweet Crepes with Chocolate Walnut Filling, Blueberry-Apricot Frangipane Tart, and Soft Ice Cream with Hazelnuts. Lidia attributes her passion and appreciation for Italian food to her family. Lidia's Italian Table is filled with stories of learning to make Easter bread with her Grandma Rosa in the town's communal oven; touching and smelling her way through the food markets of Trieste with her great-aunt Zia Nina; fishing for calamari with her uncle Zio Milio; and collecting briny mussels and sea urchins along the Istrian coastline with her cousins. This gastronomic adventure is more than just a cookbook: It is an exploration into the heart of Italian cuisine.",

Drawn into a complex triangle with two boys, she distracts herself from the onslaught of adulthood by playing the game of go with strangers in a public square--and yet the force of desire, like the occupation, proves inevitable. Unbeknownst to the girl who plays go, her most worthy and frequent opponent is a Japanese soldier in disguise. Captivated by her beauty as much as by her bold, unpredictable approach to the strategy game, the soldier finds his loyalties challenged. Is there room on the path to war for that most revolutionary of acts: falling in love?",

The sea's intricate food webs support more life by weight and a greater diversity of animals than anywhere else on the planet. Through awe-inspiring color photography, move through the waves and dive deep into the ocean's waters. Here, great white whales swim gracefully in spite of their enormous bulk, and massive coral reefs, built by countless millions of tiny creatures, grow. Further below, organisms feed off the chemicals pouring from volcanic chimneys, and at the very bottom, where intense pressure makes exploration virtually impossible, radically different life forms reside in a range of habitats. Special sections cover such subjects as dolphins, hammerheads, coral photography, and camouflage in detail, as well as the devastation wrought to this watery environment by humans--and what's being done to protect it.",

Mindful of the old woman's mystical ways, the sisters believe Fermina's gifts, bestowed based on their natural talents, magically enhance their lives. The oldest sister, Bette Davis Gabald\u00f3n, always teased for telling tales, believes her gift is the power to persuade anyone, no matter how outlandish her story.

And finally, Sophia Loren, the baby of the family, is sure her ability to make people laugh is her legacy. As the four girls grow into women they discover that Fermina's gifts come with complicated strings, and what once seemed simple can confuse over time. Together they learn the truth about their mysterious caretaker, her legacy, and the family secret that was nearly lost forever in the New Mexican desert.",

        "Description": "Writing in the bestselling tradition of Barbara Delinsky and Patricia Gaffney, Judith Henry Wall, in her new novel, The Girlfriends Club, has crafted a wry and moving story of four women who have been best friends since childhood. Through the years, and through many spiritual crises -- including the recent divorces that three of them have endured -- they have given one another emotional support. But when they are forced to share a secret that threatens to disrupt their lives, each of them begins to wonder if this bond of friendship that has held for almost four decades will be strong enough to withstand the strain.  On the eve of Mary Sue Prescott's forty-fifth birthday, she is joined by her three closest friends, Gretchen, Pamela, and Dixie, at the lakeside cabin that has been their refuge for years. This meeting of \"The Girlfriends Club\" -- as they jokingly call themselves -- is not, however, strictly a celebration, since the following morning, Mary Sue is scheduled to undergo a mastectomy. At the same time that they are dealing with Mary Sue's operation, another crisis arises, requiring the three women to make a decision that results in a haunting and terrifying secret. How these friends individually deal with their terrible secret, while going on with their lives, is a reflection of how each has coped with the traumas and stresses of the past.  Pamela, the only one of the four still married, lives in a state of perpetual fear that she will upset or embarrass her older husband, a respected judge, who is both rich and controlling, and who disapproves of Pamela's \"divorc\u00e9e\" friends.  Gretchen is fearful as well, but her anxiety stems from her concern about her future following a particularly acrimonious divorce that has left her both bitter and distrustful of all men.  Dixie, more amicably divorced, has gone on with her life -- at least up to a point. There is a man in her life again, but she keeps him a secret from her friends because she has broken one of their taboos by having an affair with a married man. For Mary Sue, divorce has been especially painful, as she has not stopped caring for her former husband. A devoted wife and mother, she was devastated when he left her for a sexy, much more sophisticated widow. Now, afraid not to have a man in her life, Mary Sue has talked herself into dating again, even if it means settling for an abusive relationship.   How these women deal with their personal secrets and fears, and with the trials and tribulations of growing older and trying to find a place in a world in which everyone seems to be younger and prettier and sexier, is at the heart of The Girlfriends Club. It is a story told with compassion, humor, and absolute truth, one that explores the dynamics of friendship, and the secrets both shared and held in their hearts, as four women learn that it is never too late to live, to trust, and to love again.",

        "Description": "How to Really Live by FaithWhen the Book of Hebrews was penned, the ages were colliding and society seemed to be shaking. Hebrews was written to Christians who were wondering what was going on and what they could do about it. As the stability of the old was passing away, their faith was wavering.One major message of Hebrews is BE CONFIDENT! God is shaking things so you might learn to live by faith and not by sight. He wants to build your life on the permanence of the eternal, not on the instability of the temporal.Look to Jesus Christ and BE CONFIDENT!Our ever-living High Priest in heaven is able to see us through our difficult and demanding days too. \"The just shall live by faith!\"",

In much the same way, when life hands us more than we can bear, circumstances overwhelm us, or we are tempted to make the safe choice rather than the right choice, God gives us the opportunity to stand firm.  As you discover God's truth for your life, you'll develop the courage to stand firm upon the grace and mercy of God, no matter what other people think. You'll learn how to live your life--even if it's not the life you would have chosen for yourself--without explanation, without apology. When life is difficult, stand firm. When relationships crumble, stand firm. When heartache comes, stand firm. Donna Partow takes you on a journey into the riches of God's grace and the ways in which it can give you the strength to carry on. Poignantly written and amazingly transparent, these pages will challenge your spirit and touch your emotions.",
