        "Title": "Decorative Silhouettes of the Twenties: For Designers and Craftsmen (Dover Pictorial Archive)",
        "Authors": "By Day, Jo Anne C.",
        "Description": "The 84 silhouettes in this book are reproduced from a collection of rare German die-cuts manufactured in the 1920s. Though reflecting many elements of the traditional silhouette that developed in the eighteenth century, they also display many modernistic features \u2014 broad, swirling, and bold forms anticipating Art Deco, the delicacy of the recently introduced Chinese and Japanese stencil designs, the contemporary dress, characteristic gesture, and mood.The subjects range from fashionable ladies (with particularly rich handling of the print and pattern of their dresses) to lovers, Pierrots and Columbines, butterflies with pixies on their backs, shepherdesses and other pastoral figures, musicians, picnics, drawing room and shopping scenes, boating parties, galleons, coaches, scenes from the Venetian lido, winged putti in many different poses, floral borders, dining and revelry scenes, trees and foliage, rabbits, Japanese lanterns, children playing, and scenes with horses and dogs. The richness in texture carries through the entire assemblage \u2014 from figures whose form is shown through a single well-placed line, to figures dressed in swirled and flowered fabrics, full of movement, encompassed in decorative background and floral borders.These illustrations can be enjoyed simply for the delicacy, artistic precision, and imagination that went into them. They can be framed or used as valentines and other greeting cards. They can also be made translucent for mounting on furniture or walls, combined for decorative lampshades, or used for decoupage. The introduction gives full directions for making this paper translucent and for mounting.This is an unusual collection of a once very popular form that has now been all but lost. Today the delicate originals are almost impossible to find, and only through extremely good fortune has this collection been kept in good order over the decades since it was created. It is probably your only chance to own or use these views.",

She acquires two admirers of a very different stamp: Olive Chancellor, devotee of radical causes, and marked out for tragedy; and Basil Ransom, veteran of the Civil War, with rigid views concerning society and women's place therein. Is the lovely, lighthearted Verena made for public movements or private passions? A struggle to possess her, body and soul, develops between Olive and Basil.The exploitation of Verena's unregenerate innocence reflects a society whose moral and cultural values are failing to survive the new dawn of liberalism and democracy.The Bostonians (1886) was not welcomed by James's fellow countrymen, who failed to appreciate its delicacy and wit; but a century later, this book is widely regarded as James's finest American fiction, and perhaps his comic masterpiece.",

        "Description": "A heartwarming and inspirational Christmas novel in the tradition of The Christmas Box, Grace, The Gift, and Finding Noel. The New York Times bestselling author of The Christmas Box and The Walk series returns with a holiday novel of hope, love, and redemption.Dear Reader, When I was in seventh grade, my English teacher, Mrs. Johnson, gave our class the intriguing (if somewhat macabre) assignment of writing our own obituaries. Oddly, I don't remember much of what I wrote about my life, but I do remember how I died: in first place on the final lap of the Daytona 500. At the time, I hadn't considered writing as an occupation, a field with a remarkably low on-the-job casualty rate. What intrigues me most about Mrs. Johnson's assignment is the opportunity she gave us to confront our own legacy. How do we want to be remembered? That question has motivated our species since the beginning of time: from building pyramids to putting our names on skyscrapers. As I began to write this book, I had two objectives: First, I wanted to explore what could happen if someone read their obituary before they died and saw, firsthand, what the world really thought of them. Their legacy. Second, I wanted to write a Christmas story of true redemption. One of my family's holiday traditions is to see a local production of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol. I don't know how many times I've seen it (perhaps a dozen), but it still thrills me to see the change that comes over Ebenezer Scrooge as he transforms from a dull, tight-fisted miser into a penitent, \"giddy-as-aschoolboy\" man with love in his heart. I always leave the show with a smile on my face and a resolve to be a better person. That's what I wanted to share with you, my dear readers, this Christmas -- a holiday tale to warm your season, your homes, and your hearts. Merry Christmas",

Waxing both profound and profane  on issues close to a father\u2019s heart\u2014from exploding diapers to toddler tantrums, from  the horrors of dressing up as Frosty the Snowman to the moments that make a father  proud\u2014Robert Wilder brilliantly captures the joys and absurdities of being a parent  today. With an artist wife and two kids\u2014a daughter, Poppy, and a son, London\u2014Robert  Wilder considers himself as open-minded as the next man. Yet even he finds himself  parentally challenged when his toddler son, London, careens around the house in the  buff or asks the kind of outrageous, embarrassing questions only a kid can ask. A  high school teacher who sometimes refers to himself jokingly as Mister Mom (when  his wife, Lala, is busy in her studio), Wilder shares warmly funny stories on everything  from sleep deprivation to why school-sponsored charities can turn otherwise sane  adults into blithering and begging idiots. Whether trying to conjure up the perfect  baby name (\u201cPoppy\u201d came to his wife\u2019s mother in a dream) or hiring a Baby Whisperer  to get some much-needed sleep, Wilder offers priceless life lessons on discipline,  potty training, even phallic fiddling (courtesy of young London). He describes the  perils of learning to live monodextrously (doing everything with one hand while carrying  your child around with the other) and the joys of watching his daughter morph into  a graceful, wise, unique little person right before his eyes. By turns tender, irreverent,  and hysterically funny, Daddy Needs a Drink is a hilarious and poignant tribute to  his family by a man who truly loves being a father.",

        "Authors": "By Roy, Lucinda",
        "Description": "The world watched in horror in April 2007 when Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho went on a killing rampage that resulted in the deaths of thirty-two students and faculty members before he ended his own life. Former Virginia Tech English department chair and distinguished professor Lucinda Roy saw the tragedy unfold on the TV screen in her home and had a terrible realization. Cho was the student she had struggled to get to know\u2013the loner who found speech torturous. After he had been formally asked to leave a poetry class in which he had shared incendiary work that seemed directed at his classmates and teacher, Roy began the difficult task of working one-on-one with him in a poetry tutorial. During those months, a year and a half before the massacre, Roy came to realize that Cho was more than just a disgruntled young adult experimenting with poetic license; he was, in her opinion, seriously depressed and in urgent need of intervention. But when Roy approached campus counseling as well as others in the university about Cho, she was repeatedly told that they could not intervene unless a student sought counseling voluntarily. Eventually, Roy\u2019s efforts to persuade Cho to seek help worked. Unbelievably, on the three occasions he contacted the counseling center staff, he did not receive a comprehensive evaluation by them\u2013a startling discovery Roy learned about after Cho\u2019s death. More revelations were to follow. After responding to questions from the media and handing over information to law enforcement as instructed by Virginia Tech, Roy was shunned by the administration. Papers documenting Cho\u2019s interactions with campus counseling were lost. The university was suddenly on the defensive. Was the university, in fact, partially responsible for the tragedy because of the bureaucratic red tape involved in obtaining assistance for students with mental illness, or was it just, like many colleges, woefully underfunded and therefore underequipped to respond to such cases? Who was Seung-Hui Cho? Was he fully protected under the constitutional right to freedom of speech, or did his writing and behavior present serious potential threats that should have resulted in immediate intervention? How can we balance students\u2019 individual freedom with the need to protect the community? These are the questions that have haunted Roy since that terrible day. No Right to Remain Silent is one teacher\u2019s cri de coeur\u2013her dire warning that given the same situation today, two years later, the ending would be no less terrifying and no less tragic.",

        "Description": "From the ultimate team- basketball superstar LeBron James and Buzz Bissinger, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Friday Night Lights and Three Nights in August-a poignant, thrilling tale of the power of teamwork to transform young lives, including James's own. The Shooting Stars were a bunch of kids-LeBron James and his best friends-from Akron, Ohio, who first met on a youth basketball team of the same name when they were ten and eleven years old. United by their love of the game and their yearning for companionship, they quickly forged a bond that would carry them through thick and thin (a lot of thin) and, at last, to a national championship in their senior year of high school. They were a motley group who faced challenges all too typical of inner-city America. LeBron grew up without a father and had moved with his mother more than a dozen times by the age of ten. Willie McGee, the quiet one, had left both his parents behind in Chicago to be raised by his older brother in Akron. Dru Joyce was outspoken, and his dad was ever present; he would end up coaching all five of the boys in high school. Sian Cotton, who also played football, was the happy-go-lucky enforcer, while Romeo Travis was unhappy, bitter, even surly, until he finally opened himself up to the bond his teammates offered him. In the summer after seventh grade, the Shooting Stars tasted glory when they qualified for a national championship tournament in Memphis. But they lost their focus and had to go home early. They promised one another they would stay together and do whatever it took to win a national title. They had no idea how hard it would be to pursue that promise. In the years that followed, they would endure jealousy, hostility, exploitation, resentment from the black community (because they went to a \"white\" high school), and the consequences of their own overconfidence. Not least, they would all have to wrestle with LeBron's outsize success, which brought too much attention and even a whiff of scandal their way. But together these five boys became men, and together they claimed the prize they had fought for all those years-a national championship.",
