Now, in The Godfather Returns, acclaimed novelist Mark Winegardner continues the story\u2013the years not covered in Puzo\u2019s bestselling book or in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s classic films. It is 1955. Michael Corleone has won a bloody victory in the war among New York\u2019s crime families. Now he wants to consolidate his power, save his marriage, and take his family into legitimate businesses. To do so, he must confront his most dangerous adversary yet, Nick Geraci, a former boxer who worked his way through law school as a Corleone street enforcer, and who is every bit as deadly and cunning as Michael. Their personal cold war will run from 1955 to 1962, exerting immense influence on the lives of America\u2019s most powerful criminals and their loved ones, including Tom Hagen, the Corleone Family\u2019s lawyer and consigliere, who embarks on a political career in Nevada while trying to protect his brother;Francesca Corleone, daughter of Michael\u2019s late brother Sonny, who is suddenly learning her family\u2019s true history and faces a difficult choice;Don Louie Russo, head of the Chicago mob, who plays dumb but has wily ambitions for muscling in on the Corleones\u2019 territory;Peter Clemenza, the stalwart Corleone underboss, who knows more Family secrets than almost anyone;Ambassador M. Corbett Shea, a former Prohibition-era bootlegger and business ally of the Corleones\u2019, who wants to get his son elected to the presidency\u2013and needs some help from his old friends;Johnny Fontane, the world\u2019s greatest saloon singer, who ascends to new heights as a recording artist, cozying up to Washington\u2019s power elite and maintaining a precarious relationship with notorious underworld figures;Kay Adams Corleone, who finally discovers the truth about her husband, Michael\u2013and must decide what it means for their marriage and their children andFredo Corleone, whose death has never been fully explained until now, and whose betrayal of the Family was part of a larger and more sinister chain of events.Sweeping from New York and Washington to Las Vegas and Cuba, The Godfather Returns is the spellbinding story of America\u2019s criminal underworld at mid-century and its intersection with the political, legal, and entertainment empires. Mark Winegardner brings an original voice and vision to Mario Puzo\u2019s mythic characters while creating several equally unforgettable characters of his own. The Godfather Returns stands on its own as a triumph\u2013in a tale about what we love, yearn for, and sometimes have reason to fear . . . family.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Description": "The American South is a geographical entity, a historical fact, a place in the imagination, and the homeland of an array of Americans who consider themselves southerners.  The region is often shrouded in romance and myth, but its realities are as intriguing, as intricate, as its legends.The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture is \"the first attempt ever\" notes U.S. News & World Report, \"to describe every aspect of a region's life and thought, the impact of its history and policies, its music and literature, its manners and myths, even the iced tea that washes down its catfish and cornbread.\"There are many Souths, many southerners.  The region's fundamental uniqueness, in fact, lies in its peculiar combination of cultural traits, a somewhat curious, often elusive blend created by blacks and whites who have lived together for more than 300 years.  In telling their stories, the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture ranges from grand historical themes to the whimsical; from the arts and high culture (William Faulkner and Leontyne Price) to folk culture (quilts, banjos, and grits) to popular culture (Gilley's and Gone With the Wind).The Encyclopedia's definition of the South is a cultural one: the South is found wherever southern culture is found.  Although the focus is on the eleven states of the former Confederacy, this volume also encompasses southern outposts in midwestern and middle-Atlantic border states, even the southern pockets of Chicago, Detroit, and Bakersfield.To foster a deeper understanding of the South's cultural patterns, the editors have organized this reference book around twenty-four thematic sections, including history, religion, folklore, language, art and architecture, recreation, politics, the mythic South, urbanization, literature, music, violence, law, and media.  The life experiences of southerners are discussed in sections on black life, ethnic life, and women's life.  Throughout, the broad goal is to identify the forces that have supported either the reality or the illusion of the southern way of life -- people, places, ideas, institutions, events, symbols, rituals, and values.The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture was developed by the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi. Contributors to the volume include historians, literary critics, sociologists, anthropologists, geographers, linguists, theologians, folklorists, architects, ecologists, lawyers, university presidents, newspaper reporters, magazine writers, and novelists.",

        "Title": "The Rage of Innocence: A Novel",
        "Authors": "By Pease, William D.",
        "Description": "An attractive and highly intelligent police detective, Christine Boland, forms the brilliant centerpiece of William D. Pease's explosive novel of psychological suspense. Detective Boland is assigned to investigate the death of socialite Marian Avery, whose body is found in her grand house in fashionable southern Maryland. Beside her sits the Averys' ten-year-old son, Ned, huddled in a silent, shock-induced world of his own that no one is able to penetrate. The murder confounds Boland and her fellow detectives. The evidence of burglary seems only to be a cover-up to confuse the police. Why, Christine wonders, would anyone want to kill Marian Avery?Soon Marian's husband, Cooper Avery, son of a former Maryland congressman, becomes the chief suspect when he gives the police a false story of his whereabouts at the time of the murder. Almost without trying, the police also uncover a motive: money. The police learn that Avery, the president of his wife's family's multimillion-dollar business, Thurston Construction, was having an affair. His lover was a woman executive at the company trying to take over Thurston. Marian's father, Ed Thurston, was fighting the takeover but Avery would make tens of millions if it happened. Avery controls Marian's shares but her father has been urging her to get them back. But if Marian were dead... The evidence mounts and Avery is indicted.All of Christine's colleagues believe that Avery is the killer, but Christine thinks they are just eager to solve a high-profile case. Certain that they are wrong, and powerless to stop the case from going forward, Christine steps over the line, and when she does she finds her own life and her passionate affair with the sculptor Alex Trigorin being drawn into the vortex. Working alone and against time, Detective Boland painstakingly uncovers long-buried Avery family secrets, finding clues from other times and other places, from the red-baiting of the McCarthy era to the tragic life of a small child growing up in Strasbourg, France.The novel's finale, the trial of Cooper Avery with its compelling and authentic courtroom scenes and the unpredictable revelations that follow, is certain to hold you in its spellbinding power.William D. Pease, whose first novel, Playing the Dozens, had Nelson DeMille comparing him to \"Dashiell Hammett at his best,\" continues brilliantly in the footsteps of Hammett in this intricate and irresistible second novel.",

In these five new chapters from his life, he is still at bay, pursued by the hounds of desire and anxiety, of unbridled criticism and publicity in a literary world ever more cheerfully crass. He fights intimations of annihilation in still-Communist Czechoslovakia, while promiscuously consorting with dissidents, apparatchiks, and Midwestern Republicans. Next, he succumbs to the temptations of power by accepting the presidency of a quaint and cosseted honorary body patterned on the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. Then, the reader finds him on trial in California and on a criminal rampage in a gothic Gotham, abetted by a nubile sidekick called Robin. Lastly, our septuagenarian veteran of the literary wars is rewarded with a coveted medal, stunning him into a well-deserved silence. It's not easy being Henry Bech in the post-Gutenbergian world, but somebody has to do it, and he brings to the task an indomitable mixture of grit and ennui.",

Now, in his own inimitable voice, he tells a true-life story with all the action, adventure, and atmosphere of Wiseguy or Serpico -- a colorful cautionary tale that reads like fiction.His first private job was to bodyguard a gaggle of Saudi princes and right away Wags was on a roll: debt collections, a blackmail case, and a divorce surveillance that gives new meaning to the phrase \"man's best friend\"; movie stars, private jets, car chases, even a helicopter getaway under fire during an international child custody kidnapping. As the stories pile up, the money gets better and the players get bigger...until he settles in as security chief of an upscale strip club and suddenly finds himself trapped between the Mafia and a psychotic enforcer for the Russian mob.An up-close-and-personal look at a world we rarely see, from an honest-to-God character whose walk on the wild side ended up on the wrong side of the law.",

        "Description": "To the Storm by Yue Daiyun and Carolyn Wakeman is the fascinating story of Yue Daiyun, a faculty member at Beijing University. Yue Daiyun was a revolutionary from her early school days. She had been a child during the anti-Japanese war and hated the Guomundang. Accepted as a student at Beida in 1948, she joined the Communist Party&#39;s underground Democratic youth League and became a Party member the following year and helped with the Liberation of Beijing.\u00a0While a student at Beida, she served as a delegate at the Prague 2nd World Student Congress in 1950 and worked in the countryside on land reform in 1951-52. Then she graduated from Beida and became a faculty member in the literature department. She married her husband, Lao Tang, the day after their graduation. He obtained a faculty position in the philosophy department. Both were loyal to Chairman Mao and the goals of the Revolution.\u00a0Their lives went smoothly for several years until 1958. Yue Daiyun taught Chinese literature and took part in many activities on campus. She read many Western books and supported the formation of a new literary magazine on campus. This eventually brought her into conflict with the authorities and the beginning of two decades of problems and persecution for her and her family. The Party had encouraged openness and criticism of its mistakes and deficiencies in the system. Yue Daiyun had taken part in the discussions, believing that she was helping to build a better China.\u00a0Summoned to a meeting at her department one day, she was denounced as a rightist. She did not understand what she did wrong, but she was quickly relieved of her teaching duties and sent to the countryside to work and live with the peasants for two years. This was the first of her suspensions from teaching.\u00a0Both Yue Daiyun and her husband, Lao Tang, were caught up in the persecution and violence of the Cultural Revolution. They had spent two years at a cadre school in Liyouhoz and when they returned to Beijing, Lao Tang was selected to work on a special task force called Liang Xaio. This brought Lao Tang and the group into close association with Jiang Qing and the Gang of Four. When the Gang of Four was arrested, Lao Tang suffered through a year long investigation before being cleared. Throughout this time their family suffered from the persecution of others. In the end, the authorities admitted that they were wrong in their case against her and reinstated her Party membership.\u00a0In this interesting autobiography, Yue Daiyun tells her story of the life she and her family lived during these somewhat violent and terror-filled years in China.",

All these and hundreds of other topics are covered in this artfully designed volume, with more than two hundred full-color photographs and drawings.
