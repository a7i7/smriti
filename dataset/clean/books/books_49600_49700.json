        "Description": "From the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist and bestselling author of Backlash\u2014an unflinching dissection of the mind of America after 9/11\u00a0In this most original examination of America\u2019s post-9/11 culture, Susan Faludi shines a light on the country\u2019s psychological response to the attacks on that terrible day. Turning her acute observational powers on the media, popular culture, and political life, Faludi unearths a barely acknowledged but bedrock societal drama shot through with baffling contradictions. Why, she asks, did our culture respond to an assault against American global dominance with a frenzied summons to restore \u201ctraditional\u201d manhood, marriage, and maternity? Why did we react as if the hijackers had targeted not a commercial and military edifice but the family home and nursery? Why did an attack fueled by hatred of Western emancipation lead us to a regressive fixation on Doris Day womanhood and John Wayne masculinity, with trembling \u201csecurity moms,\u201d swaggering presidential gunslingers, and the \u201crescue\u201d of a female soldier cast as a \u201chelpless little girl\u201d?\u00a0The answer, Faludi finds, lies in a historical anomaly unique to the American experience: the nation that in recent memory has been least vulnerable to domestic attack was forged in traumatizing assaults by nonwhite \u201cbarbarians\u201d on town and village. That humiliation lies concealed under a myth of cowboy bluster and feminine frailty, which is reanimated whenever threat and shame looms.\u00a0Brilliant and important, The Terror Dream shows what 9/11 revealed about us\u2014and offers the opportunity to look at ourselves anew.",

Now Campbell turns her abundant talents to fiction in an evocative first novel, Your Blues Ain't Like Mine.Chicago-born Armstrong Todd is fifteen, black, and unused to the segregated ways of the Deep South when his mother sends him to spend the summer with relatives in her native rural Mississippi. For speaking a few innocuous words in French to a white woman, Armstrong pays the ultimate price when her husband, brother-in-law, and father-in-law decide to teach him a lesson. The lives of everyone involved in the incident - black and white - are changed forever, and the reverberations extend well into the next generation.Resonant with the sorrows of poverty and racial prejudice as well as the triumphs of love and social justice, Your Blues Ain't Like Mine marks the debut of a powerful, clear voice in contemporary fiction.",

        "Description": "Just one day after losing his father, Irvin Favre, to a heart attack and fatal car crash, Brett Favre took the field for a Monday Night Football game against the notorious Oakland Raiders.  Even with the Green Bay Packers clinging to\u00a0a slim chance for a playoff spot, his teammates and his adopted city didn\u2019t expect Brett to suit up.  \u00a0Big Irv was the game to Brett.  As his coach at Hancock North Central High School in Kiln, Mississippi, Irv taught Brett the importance of execution, precision, and sacrifice.  He rarely let Brett throw the ball; rather, he had him lead the run-oriented wishbone offense, which required him to handoff and then block for his teammates.  When no major college had any interest in Brett as a quarterback, Irv got the University of Southern Mississippi to give him a shot as a defensive back.  And when Brett did the impossible at Southern Miss\u2013moving from defense to the team\u2019s starting quarterback his freshman year\u2013Irv was there the whole way.\u00a0Prior to the Raider game, Favre had started an exhausting 189 games straight (an NFL record) and was nursing a broken finger on his throwing hand since the early weeks of the 2003 season.  Rumors of his retirement circulated among the press\u2013he was in his thirteenth year\u2013and while no one said it out loud, most commentators believed Brett was a shadow of his former self.   But what happened in the Oakland twilight on December 22, 2003, is the stuff of NFL legend.  Brett Favre sealed his reputation as one of the greatest football players in history.\u00a0\u201cI knew that my dad would have wanted me to play,\u201d he said after throwing for just under 400 hundred yards and four touchdowns to rout the Raiders. \u201cI love him so much, and I love this game. It meant a great deal to me, to my dad, and to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching.\u201d\u00a0FAVRE is a dazzling tribute to the roller-coaster football life of Brett Favre, with personal family photos and remembrances, stunning four-color action shots, and inspiring stories of a lifelong love affair with the all-American game.",

        "Description": "Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, largely unknown when she died in a Carmelite convent at the age of twenty-four, became-through her posthumously published autobiography-one of the world's most influential religious figures. In Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, bestselling novelist and memoirist Kathryn Harrison, whose depictions of women have been called \"powerful\" (The New York Times Book Review) and \"luminously intelligent\" (The Boston Sunday Globe), brings to the saint's life her storytelling gift and deep insight as she reveals the hopes and fears of the young girl behind the religious icon.  Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux shows us the pampered daughter of successful and deeply religious tradespeople who-through a personal appeal to the pope-entered a convent at the early age of fifteen. There, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se embraced sacrifice and self-renunciation in a single-minded pursuit of the \"nothingness\" she felt would bring her closer to God. With feeling, Harrison shows us the sensitive four-year-old whose mother's death haunted her forever and contributed to the ascetic spirituality that strengthened her to embrace even the deadly throes of tuberculosis. Tellingly placed in the context of late-nineteenth-century French social and religious practices, this is a powerful story of a life lived with enormous passion and a searing, triumphant voyage of the spirit.",

        "Description": "Before the term hacking became associated with computers, MIT                undergraduates used it to describe any activity that took their minds off studying,                suggested an unusual solution to a technical problem, or generally fostered                nondestructive mischief. The MIT hacking culture has given us such treasures as                police cars and cows on the Great Dome, a disappearing door to the President's                office, and the commencement game of \"Al Gore Buzzword Bingo.\" Hacks can be                technical, physical, virtual, or verbal. Often the underlying motivation is to                conquer the inaccessible and make possible the improbable. Hacks can express                dissatisfaction with local culture or with administrative decisions, but mostly they                are remarkably good-spirited. They are also by definition ephemeral. Fortunately,                the MIT Museum has amassed a unique collection of hack-related pictures, reports,                and remnants. Nightwork collects the best materials from this collection, to                entertain innocent bystanders and inspire new generations of                practitioners.",

        "Description": "From America's Queen of Suspense comes a gripping tale of a young woman trying to unravel the mystery of a family tragedy -- a quest with terrifying repercussions. It has been ten years since twenty-one-year-old Charles MacKenzie Jr. (\"Mack\") went missing. A Columbia University senior, about to graduate and already accepted at Duke University Law School, he walked out of his apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side without a word to his college roommates and has never been seen again. However, he does make one ritual phone call to his mother every year: on Mother's Day. Each time, he assures her he is fine, refuses to answer her frantic questions, then hangs up. Even the death of his father, a corporate lawyer, in the tragedy of 9/11 does not bring him home or break the pattern of his calls. Mack's sister, Carolyn, is now twenty-six, a law school graduate, and has just finished her clerkship for a civil court judge in Manhattan. She has endured two family tragedies, yet she realizes that she will never be able to have closure and get on with her life until she finds her brother. She resolves to discover what happened to Mack and why he has found it necessary to hide from them. So this year when Mack makes his annual Mother's Day call, Carolyn interrupts to announce her intention to track him down, no matter what it takes. The next morning after Mass, her uncle, Monsignor Devon MacKenzie, receives a scrawled message left in the collection basket: \"Uncle Devon, tell Carolyn she must not look for me.\"Mack's cryptic warning does nothing to deter his sister from taking up the search, despite the angry reaction of her mother, Olivia, and the polite disapproval of Elliott Wallace, Carolyn's honorary uncle, who is clearly in love with Olivia. Carolyn's pursuit of the truth about Mack's disappearance swiftly plunges her into a world of unexpected danger and unanswered questions. What is the secret that Gus and Lil Kramer, the superintendents of the building in which Mack was living, have to hide? What do Mack's old roommates, the charismatic club owner Nick DeMarco and the cold and wealthy real estate tycoon Bruce Galbraith, know about Mack's disappearance? Is Nick connected to the disappearance of Leesey Andrews, who had last been seen in his trendy club? Can the police possibly believe that Mack is not only alive, but a serial killer, a shadowy predator of young women? Was Mack also guilty of the brutal murder of his drama teacher and the theft of his taped sessions with her? Carolyn's passionate search for the truth about her brother -- and for her brother himself -- leads her into a deadly confrontation with someone close to her whose secret he cannot allow her to reveal.",

The queen, Catherine de Medici, a dabbler in black magic, has decided to get rid of the king's mistress by seeking out the legendary Undying Head of Menander the Magus, known as the Master of All Desires. But only Nostradamus understands the true nature of this evil object, which sows destruction everywhere it goes and does indeed grant wishes - but with a deadly twist......As Nostradamus hurries to Paris to warn the queen, he discovers that the coffer containing the Master has fallen into the possession of a charming, wryly perceptive but stubborn young woman: Sibille Artaud de la Rogue, a bluestocking aspiring poet. Sibille is tempted by Menander to obtain all her desires - beauty, genius, and a dashing, intelligent cavalier. Can Nostradamus stop these determined ladies from wishing on the Master of All Desires and destroy it before it brings down the entire kingdom?The three-way battle that ensues between a prophet who scorns poetry, a woman in love, and a sly and ruthless queen is set against the rich, detailed tapestry of a nation on the verge of civil war and a lively constellation of famous figures clustered around Nostradamus, seer of the millennium.",

        "Title": "The Oxford Book of Essays",
        "Authors": "By Gross, John",
        "Description": "When Montaigne developed the essay in the sixteenth century, he could not have imagined the power and longevity of his creation.  \"He did not set up for a philosopher, wit, orator, or moralist,\" wrote Hazlitt, \"but he became all these by merely daring to tell us whatever passed through his mind.\"  Ever since, writers have seized upon his example, and for over four hundred years we have encountered astonishing insights and breathtaking language by following what has passed through their minds, as recounted in the essay.  And now some of the finest essays of all time have been gathered together by John Gross, former editor of The New York Times Book Review, in an outstanding new anthology.     Ranging from the early 1600s through the 1980s, this sweeping collection includes 140 essays by 120 of the finest writers in the history of the English language.  John Gross has collected classics and rare gems, representative samples and personal favorites, intimate essays and learned, serious reflections and hysterically funny satire, by both British and American writers.  Here is Eveleyn Waugh, providing tips on how to move in Well-Informed Circles (\"Attribute all facts of common knowledge to personal information; for instance, do not say, 'What a wet week it has been,' but, 'They tell me at Greenwich they have registered the highest rainfall for six weeks'\"); Ralph Waldo Emerson on conservatism and innovation; Ambrose Bierce on \"the horror of the characteristic American custom of promiscuous, unsought, and unauthorized introductions\"; Oscar Wilde on the critic as artist (\"It is only about things that do not interest one that one can give a really unbiased opion, which is no doubt the reason why an unbiased opinion is always absolutely valueless\"); Rose Macaulay on dinner parties; and James Baldwin, musing about what a remote Swiss village tells him about race in the wider world (\"Joyce is right about history being a nightmare--but it may be the nightmare from which no one can awaken.  People are trapped in history, and history is trapped in them.\").    The authors Gross has gathered form a gallery of genius, all indispensable masters of rhetoric, from Samuel Butler to Samuel Johnson, from John Dryden to Ben Franklin, from Geoge Eliot to George Bernard Shaw, from E.B. White to Joan Didion.  Including book reviews and travel sketches, history lessons and meditations, reflections on art and on potato chips, these essays sample four centuries of eloquence and insight in a collection that is at once immensely enlightening, edifying, and entertaining.",

        "Authors": "By Feshbach, Murray",
        "Description": "During the course of the cold war, the United States committed immense resources to the task of penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding its great adversary, the Soviet Union. Guesswork -- sometimes educated, sometimes not -- was a major component of Western estimates of the basic facts about the USSR\u2019s economy, natural resources, military, government, an everyday affairs. The final proof, however, that the essence of Soviet internal affairs eluded us until the end was the overwhelming shock of the sudden reversal of past belligerency and the subsequent rapid breakup of the Communist empire.Given the new open societies of the former Soviet Union, we can expect to and do know much more about almost every facet of life. In fact, the information that has gradually emerged since 1989 is dispelling many false presumptions. However, as the new information and information sharing  increases, many remnants of Soviet officialdom and media are still producing information that fall far short of contemporary American standards. Equally, as the West faces the Former Soviet Union with open arms and eyes, will they like what they see? And will the Westerners be able to face the dark and lonely secrets they so desperately wanted to know about?It is important for the West to recognize the serious societal, economic, environment, and health crisis currently unfolding in the Former Soviet Union. For the West to ignore the problems that are now surfacing, would be an act of considerable indifference and callousness in the face of a clear humanitarian crisis. Not to mention it could also be a significant political mistake, risking the hostility of future generations toward Europe and the United States. Not everything can be done at once. However, the West needs to act quickly to provide the most basic humanitarian assistance to the afflicted populations. A strategy must be set up to tackle the problems and questions facing the United States and the Former Soviet Union.",

        "Authors": "By Kotter, John P.",
        "Description": "In today's complex work world, things no longer get done simply because someone issues an order and someone else follows it.Most of us work in socially intricate organizations where we need the help not only of subordinates but of colleagues, superiors, and outsiders to accomplish our goals. This often leaves us in a \"power gap\" because we must depend on people over whom we have little or no explicit control.This is a book about how to bridge that gap: how to exercise the power and influence you need to get things done through others when your responsibilities exceed your formal authority.Full of original ideas and expert insights about how organizations?and the people in them?function, Power and Influence goes further, demonstrating that lower-level personnel also need strong leadership skills and interpersonal know-how to perform well.Kotter shows how you can develop sufficient resources of \"unofficial\" power and influence to achieve goals, steer clear of conflicts, foster creative team behavior, and gain the cooperation and support you need from subordinates, coworkers, superiors?even people outside your department or organization.He also shows how you can avoid the twin traps of naivete and cynicism when dealing with power relationships, and how to use your power without abusing it.Power and Influence is essential for top managers who need to overcome the infighting, foot-dragging, and politicking that can destroy both morale and profits; for middle managers who don't want their careers sidetracked by unproductive power struggles; for professionals hindered by bureaucratic obstacles and deadline delays; and for staff workers who have to \"manage the boss.\"This is not a book for those who want to \"grab\" power for their own ends. But if you'd like to create smooth, responsive working relationships and increase your personal effectiveness on the job, Kotter can show you how?and make the dynamics of power work for you instead of against you.",

At twenty-seven, he's practically the right-hand man of the company's founder - a wealthy old pro looking to make a big comeback on The Street while grooming Conner for a place at the top. Between his career and his gorgeous girlfriend, it's a good life, with every indication of getting even better - until a wayward E-mail crosses Conner's computer, and plunges his near-perfect world into a terrifying downward spiral.\"The 'operation' is way out of hand. If we don't do something, it's going to detonate.\" It's a communication not meant for Conner's eyes, between people he doesn't know, about a company he's never heard of - a company that's engaged in corporate fraud on a massive scale. With no way to trace the E-mail, it's impossible for Conner to act on the volatile discovery. But with millions of dollars at stake, high-powered careers in the balance, and hell to pay if the truth comes out, whoever clicked the \"send\" button by mistake isn't about to take any chances. And for Connor, the evening that began in the arms of a beautiful woman ends in a harrowing race for his life.As he follows a twisting trail of misdeeds and misinformation that stretches nationwide, Conner slowly uncovers a shocking plot as undeniably real as the gunshot wound in his arm. Now, surviving will mean struggling to expose the truth as relentlessly as his shadowy enemies seek to conceal it - and fighting for his life as ruthlessly as those determined to end it.",

        "Description": "For the past twenty-five years\u2014first as the blithe spirit of the Today show, then as the only woman ever to anchor a network news program solo\u2014Katie Couric has been a familiar visitor in the homes of millions. Yet, despite all her public exposure, no one\u2014until now\u2014has been able to penetrate the secrets behind her closely guarded personal life and her struggles in the cutthroat world of television news. In this probing portrait of America\u2019s news queen, bestselling author Edward Klein rips away the mask that has hidden the many faces of Katie Couric: the strong, independent woman and the needy wife and lover; the grieving widow famed for her kindness to others and the fiercely competitive diva; the consummate television interviewer and the stumbling network anchor.Drawing on scores of interviews with people who have never spoken openly about Couric before, Katie: The Real Story absorbingly chronicles Katie\u2019s rise to the top\u2014from her early days at CNN and local television stations (where she was told she\u2019d never succeed) to her phenomenalfifteen-year run on Today. For the first time, Klein reveals the critical role Katie\u2019s father played in her risky decision to leave Today for the hallowed anchor chair once occupied by Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather.As Klein makes clear, Katie\u2019s road to stardom has been paved with rocky personal relationships: a turbulent marriage to Jay Monahan, who died of colon cancer; testy associations with Today cohosts Bryant Gumbel and Matt Lauer; and several star-crossed love affairs, including one with a man seventeen years her junior. Katie: The Real Story is a candid portrait of a folksy charmer, loving single mother, cunning businesswoman, feminist icon, and notorious diva. Neither a whitewash nor a hatchet job, it\u2019s a truthful, unflinching look at a remarkable woman and the media kingdom she\u2019s sought to rule.",

        "Authors": "By Godoff (EDT) and Toobin, Jeffrey",
        "Description": "The Run of His Life will be the definitive history of the most famous criminal proceeding of the century. Here is the whole story of the events of June 12, 1994, and their aftermath, as it has never been told - rich in character, driven by the nonstop plot of a legal thriller, and nuanced by the foibles, vanities, and idiosyncracies of its participants. This news-breaking, behind-the-scenes book will transform what you thought you knew.Jeffrey Toobin's stunning coverage of the trial of O. J. Simpson for The New Yorker magazine was the first to focus on the reality that no one wanted to address directly but that pervaded every moment of the trial and perhaps even the crime itself - that race was at the heart of everything. Toobin's explosive article in July 1994, \"An Incendiary Defense,\" laid out the defense lawyers' strategy, fingered Mark Fuhrman as their chief villain, and made the \"race card\" the euphemism of choice.In The Run of His Life, Toobin's great reporting, based on his unprecedented access to sources on all sides, lets us see, in a fresh light, the prosecutors, defense attorneys, private eyes, waiters, dog walkers, cops, ex-football stars, TV personalities, forensic experts, and so many others who, if they were not already, have become household names. The plaintive wail, the bloody glove, the \"n-word,\" the Dream Team, and the Bronco chase are images so much a part of our collective unconscious that they need no further introduction. But Toobin provides a new understanding of these modern totems as well as an insightful examination of the larger questions raised by the case - including the importance of celebrity, race (and the way it's manipulated in the politically correct media), California as both a state and a state of mind, domestic violence, American jurisprudence, and the efficacy of the jury system.",

This book details a handful of important cases Earthjustice has pursued in the last decade - a time in which its focus has shifted slightly from preserving pristine landscapes to restoring damaged ones, and to working on behalf of communities threatened by environmental harm.One chapter recounts a monumental crusade to stop a mining giant from reopening an old, bleeding gold mine on the border of Yellowstone National Park. Another describes efforts to heal a California river ravaged by logging and road building. In Washington, D.C., Earthjustice lawyers banded with groups in the poorer southeast neighborhoods to block massive unnecessary development along the Anacostia River. In rural northern Louisiana, it helped two tiny African-American communities stop a uranium processing plant from being built nearly on top of them. And from Hawai`i comes news of a campaign to restore water stolen from Windward O`ahu and piped eastward to grow sugar, wreaking havoc on native Hawaiian communities nearly a century ago.The stories are illustrated by photographs from leading nature and wildlife photographers such as Robert Glenn Ketchum, Galen Rowell, and Carr Clifton, as well as documentary images of the places, people, and activities portrayed. Graceful and accurate watercolor maps orient the reader in each chapter.",

        "Description": "The story of two women whose lives intersect in late-nineteenth-century Japan, The Teahouse Fire is also a portrait of one of the most fascinating places and times in all of history - Japan as it opens its doors to the West. It was a period when one's choice of kimono could make a political statement, when women stopped blackening their teeth to profess allegiance to Western ideas, and when Japan's most mysterious rite - the tea ceremony - became not just a sacramental meal, but a ritual battlefield.We see it all through the eyes of Aurelia Bernard, an American orphan who has just turned her back on the only family she has left: the abusive missionary uncle who has brought her along on his mission to Christianize Japan. One night in 1866, fleeing both her uncle and a fire that sweeps the city, she takes shelter in Kyoto's beautiful and mysterious Baishian teahouse, a place that will open entirely new worlds to her - and bring her a new family.It is there that she discovers the woman who will come to define the next several decades of her life, Shin Yukako, daughter of Kyoto's most important tea master and one of the first women to openly teach the sacred ceremony known as the Way of Tea. Taking Aurelia for the abandoned daughter of a prostitute rather than a foreigner, the Shin family renames her Urako and adopts her as Yukako's attendant and surrogate younger sister. Yukako provides Aurelia with generosity, wisdom, and protection as she navigates a culture that is not always accepting of outsiders. From her privileged position at Yukako's side, Aurelia aids in her crusade to preserve the tea ceremony as it starts to fall out of favor under pressure of intense Westernization. And Aurelia herself is embraced and rejected as modernizing Japan embraces and rejects an era of radical change.",

        "Description": "China has emerged as an economic powerhouse (projected to have the largest economy in the world in a little over a decade) and is taking an ever-increasing role on the world stage. China's Rise: Challenges and Opportunities will help the United States and the rest of the world better comprehend the facts and dynamics underpinning China's rise\u2014an understanding that becomes more and more important with each passing day. Additionally, the authors suggest actions both China and the United States can take that will not only maximize the opportunities for China's constructive integration into the international community but also help form a domestic consensus that will provide a stable foundation for such policies. Filled with facts for policymakers, this much anticipated book's narrative-driven, accessible style will appeal to the general reader. This book is unique in that it analyzes the authoritative data on China's economy, foreign and domestic policy, and national security. The expert judgments in this book paint a picture of a China confronting domestic challenges that are in many ways side effects of its economic successes, while simultaneously trying to take advantage of the foreign policy benefits of those same successes.China's Rise: Challenges and Opportunities from The China Balance Sheet Project, a joint, multiyear project of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Peterson Institute, discusses China's military modernization, China's increasing soft power influence in Asia and around the world, China's policy toward Taiwan, domestic political development, Beijing's political relations with China's provincial and municipal authorities, corruption and social unrest, rebalancing China's economic growth, the exchange rate controversy, energy and the environment, industrial policy, trade disputes, and investment issues. This book is part of the CSIS-IIE China Balance Sheet project. For more information about this project, please visit www.chinabalancesheet.org.",

        "Description": "WaterBrook Press Reader\u2019s Guide for All Together in One Place by Jane Kirkpatrick \u201cOne of the incidents that made a profound impression upon the minds of all was the meeting with eleven wagons returning, and not a man left in the entire train. All the men had died and had been buried on the way, and the women and children were returning to their homes alone from a point well up on the Plate, below Fort Laramie. The difficulties of the return trip were multiplied on account of the throng moving westward. How those women succeeded in their attempt, or what became of them, we never knew.\u201d --Ezra Meeker recalling an incident on his first journey west on the Oregon Trail in 1852 . As with many of us, Mazy Bacon thought she yearned for the things that gave her nurture: her home and garden, her dog, the love and comfort of her husband, the visits of her mother. She did not like surprises or change and told her husband so. She liked a predictable life and thought that she controlled it. \u201cThings\u2019re not always what they seem,\u201d her husband said one evening in early 1850 and thus began this young woman\u2019s journey to the wilderness places of her life - the wilderness of landscape, relationship and the yearnings of her soul. ALL TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE is a novel, set in 1852, about eleven wagons of women seeking the nurture of home and facing change. But more it is a story of the wilderness places of our lives today and the discovery of what we\u2019re given-if we will seek it-to see us through. Writer Terry Tempest Williams reminds us that \u201cto step into wilderness is to court risk.\u201d We are warned in life to be prepared before we step where few have gone before. But sometimes we are forced to enter the wilderness. Death, divorce, loneliness and betrayal announce the wilderness of relationship. A move, an illness or an accident can separate us from familiar landscapes, friends and even ourselves, piercing us in places we fight so hard to stay away from. The wilderness of spirit can challenge, too, revealing both fears and fragile places in our faith that trouble us and taking us deep into uncertainty. But wrapped within the wilderness places, treasure sparkles-if we believe, persevere, and reach beyond, if we will trust the Psalmist\u2019s words, \u201cThe Lord knows my lot. He makes my boundaries fall on pleasant places.\u201d To find those pleasant places of our lives, no matter where we are, we\u2019re asked to stretch, to risk and trust and to admit that we have entered wilderness, that life as we once knew it and believed that we controlled, has ended. With that admission, we can court commitment not just risk, and with faith and friends, move forward toward abundance we otherwise would never known was there. --Jane Kirkpatrick",

And if I can avoid him via text messaging for the next nine months of free health insurance, everything will be just fine. Except that he's just asked--no, insisted--that I go with him on a business trip to the Caribbean. Gulp. Ordinarily, this would be cause for celebration. Ordinarily, I'd shave my legs, pack my bikini, revel in day-glo drinks and my seething lust for Mr. Swarthy-And-Secretive.

        "Title": "The Harlot by the Side of the Road: Forbidden Tales of the Bible",
        "Authors": "By Kirsch, Jonathan",
        "Description": "\"The stories you are about to read are some of the most violent and sexually explicit in all of Western literature. They are tales of human passion in all of its infinite variety: adultery, seduction, incest, rape, mutilation, assassination, torture, sacrifice, and murder. . . .\"Sex. Violence. Scandal. These are words we rarely associate with the sacred text of the Bible. Yet in this brilliant book, Jonathan Kirsch recounts shocking tales that have been suppressed by religious authorities throughout history. Kirsch places each story within the political and social context of its time, delves into the latest biblical scholarship to explain why each one was originally censored, and shows how these ancient narratives hold valuable lessons for all of us.",
