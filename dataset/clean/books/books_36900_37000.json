        "Title": "The Other 90%: How to Unlock Your Vast Untapped Potential for Leadership and Life",
        "Authors": "By Cooper, Robert K.",
        "Description": "For centuries, it has been assumed that there are vast limits to human capacity. Now, although a host of scientific discoveries prove this wrong, a mindset of limits persists, blocking us from our greatest possibilities and leaving us feeling bombarded by stress, change, and uncertainty. No matter how hard we work, no matter how much we give, we're still not getting what we hoped for. There is another way.Dr. Robert Cooper, a neuroscience pioneer and leadership advisor, urges us to take a radically different view of human capacity. We are mostly unused potential, he says, employing less than 10 percent of our brilliance or hidden talents. In easy-to-follow steps, he explains how to develop and apply the art and science of your hidden capacity.The art is the motivation and inspiration coming from the wonderful stories that are the heart of The Other 90%. Dr. Cooper draws on his wide-ranging insights and experiences to show how it's possible to make a difference in yourself and others.However, inspiration without a way to turn vision into reality is an empty vessel. Combining art with science, Dr. Cooper provides extraordinary help in the form of specific, little-known practical ways to use the latest research in neuroscience, performance psychology, and work physiology for excelling in a pressure-filled world.  He shows you how to:* Increase energy at work -- and have more energy for personal and family life.* Activate the brain's \"alertness switches\" to defeat pressure and stress.* Use not only the brain in your head but the ones in your heart and gut.* Motivate exceptional ingenuity and performance in yourself and others.The most exciting breakthroughs will not come from advances in technology but from a deeper realization of what it means to be most human and alive. Many of the choices that can dramatically change our lives are simple and practical -- yet few people know what these choices are or how to apply them in work and life. The Other 90% is your guide to new territory and new challenges.",

        "Description": "When Palmer Stoat notices the black pickup truck following him on the highway, he fears his precious Range Rover is about to be carjacked. But Twilly Spree, the man tailing Stoat, has vengeance, not sport-utility vehicles, on his mind. Idealistic, independently wealthy and pathologically short-tempered, Twilly has dedicated himself to saving Florida's wilderness from runaway destruction. He favors unambiguous political statements -- such as torching Jet-Skis or blowing up banks -- that leave his human targets shaken but re-educated.After watching Stoat blithely dump a trail of fast-food litter out the window, Twilly decides to teach him a lesson. Thus, Stoat's prized Range Rover becomes home to a horde of hungry dung beetles. Which could have been the end to it had Twilly not discovered that Stoat is one of Florida's cockiest and most powerful political fixers, whose latest project is the \"malling\" of a pristine Gulf Coast island. Now the real Hiaasen-variety fun begins . . .Dognapping eco-terrorists, bogus big-time hunters, a Republicans-only hooker, an infamous ex-governor who's gone back to nature, thousands of singing toads and a Labrador retriever greater than the sum of his Labrador parts -- these are only some of the denizens of Carl Hiaasen's outrageously funny new novel.Brilliantly twisted entertainment wrapped around a powerful ecological plea, Sick Puppy gleefully lives up to its title and gives us Hiaasen at his riotous and muckraking best.",

In Collector's Choice, she introduces the homes of dedicated \"keepers\" - some who have collected classic country for twenty-five years, and others who specialize in the newer areas of collecting - Native American and rustic furniture, or an eclectic mix of Scandinavian and Amish. In Dealer's Choice, she presents the homes of the experts, who are more often found behind the scenes, and whose collections represent not only passion, but also discipline and a highly trained eye.Interspersed with the inspiring interiors are Mary's secrets for collecting today, organized in twelve special sections - Found Collections, Smalls, Native Crafts of the Southwest, The Eclectic Decorator, The Tale of the Tag, Care and Feeding of Antiques, The Allure of Painted Furniture, The Art of Picking, The Romance of Wood, Shopping for Antiques, The Next Wave, and Religious Art of New Mexico.With 350 photographs, Mary Emmerling's New Country Collecting is an inspiration for both collecting and decorating. With its special how-to \"miniseminars\" and its national source listing, it is the best resource for today's collector. And with Mary Emmerling as the guide, it is an exciting, enriching tour through the collector's world.",

Using innovative, easy-to-master techniques and surprisingly inexpensive materials (paint, paper, fabric, replica molding -- even photocopies!), Kevin McCloud -- a brilliant young set designer turned interior decorator -- shows you everything you need to know to design and create your own stunning adaptations of today's most popular decorating styles.  There are forty styles in all -- from Santa Fe, Shaker, Miami Deco, and Caribbean to Bauhaus, Biedermeier, Mackintosh, and French Country (to name just a few) -- each designed and created especially by the author and stunningly photographed, with literally hundreds of styling options and color variations to choose from.  Each style is represented by a complete floor-to-ceiling \"room slice\" -- a unique device that allows you to see the total impact of a scheme while easily visualizing its possibilities for your own room. The decorative effects and other components of each style are analyzed, rephotographed with a full range of imaginative alternatives, and cross-referenced to all the techniques, tools, and materials needed to create each unique effect. Even the most inexperienced and budget-conscious of home owners will be inspired by Kevin McCloud's imaginative use of inexpensive, readily available materials and amazing timesaving techniques.  Whether you do the work yourself or hire it out, whether you're redoing an alcove or an entire house, Decorative Style will kindle your imagination and give you all the tools you need to create spectacular, one-of-a-kind interiors that will truly distinguish and enhance the value of your home.",

The choice of food is immense: plants grow in a multitude of forms, from seaweeds to cactuses and from grasses to forest trees: animal prey is available from tiny krill in the oceans to antelopes on the plains. As almost every species is accessible to another with the right feeding strategy, there is a continual evolutionary jostling between eater and eaten for the advantage over the other.Among both plants and animals elaborate strategies have evolved for exploring the surrounding life as food. The feeding behavior of predators is based on a search and strike strategy. In contrast, grazers live surrounded by their food and are relatively immobile. Such animals as impalas and grasshoppers, whose persistent feeding make them ready prey, have evolved means of avoiding the notice of predators or methods of speedy escape. Plants that digest animal tissue have evolved complex and devious means to attract prey.The variations in style of these feeding encounters and the precision involved in some of the feeding mechanisms are the themes ofFeeding Strategy.",

        "Title": "World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability",
        "Authors": "By Chua, Amy",
        "Description": "The reigning consensus holds that the combination of free markets and democracy would transform the third world and sweep away the ethnic hatred and religious zealotry associated with underdevelopment. In this revelatory investigation of the true impact of globalization, Yale Law School professor Amy Chua explains why many developing countries are in fact consumed by ethnic violence after adopting free market democracy. Chua shows how in non-Western countries around the globe, free markets have concentrated starkly disproportionate wealth in the hands of a resented ethnic minority. These \u201cmarket-dominant minorities\u201d \u2013 Chinese in Southeast Asia, Croatians in the former Yugoslavia, whites in Latin America and South Africa, Indians in East Africa, Lebanese in West Africa, Jews in post-communist Russia \u2013 become objects of violent hatred. At the same time, democracy empowers the impoverished majority, unleashing ethnic demagoguery, confiscation, and sometimes genocidal revenge. She also argues that the United States has become the world\u2019s most visible market-dominant minority, a fact that helps explain the rising tide of anti-Americanism around the world.
