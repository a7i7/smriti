Its impact was immediate and continues to this day, in the academic world and beyond. Translated into sixteen languages, with more than 700,000 copies sold around the world, In a Different Voice has inspired new research, new educational initiatives, and political debate\u2014and helped many women and men to see themselves and each other in a different light.Carol Gilligan believes that psychology has persistently and systematically misunderstood women\u2014their motives, their moral commitments, the course of their psychological growth, and their special view of what is important in life. Here she sets out to correct psychology's misperceptions and refocus its view of female personality. The result is truly a tour de force, which may well reshape much of what psychology now has to say about female experience.",

        "Description": "\"A loving testament to the work and reward of the best friendships,\u00a0the kind where your arms can\u2019t distinguish burden from embrace.\u201d --PeopleNew York Times Bestselling author Ann Patchett\u2019s first work of nonfiction chronicling her decades-long friendship with the critically acclaimed and recently deceased author, Lucy Grealy. Ann Patchett and the late Lucy Grealy met in college in 1981, and, after enrolling in the Iowa Writer\u2019s Workshop, began a friendship that would be as defining to both of their lives as their work. In Gealy's critically acclaimed and hugely successful memoir, Autobiography of a Face, she wrote about losing part of her jaw to childhood cancer, years of chemotherapy and radiation, and endless reconstructive surgeries. In Truth & Beauty, the story isn't Lucy's life or Ann's life, but the parts of their lives they shared together. This is a portrait of unwavering commitment that spans twenty years, from the long cold winters of the Midwest, to surgical wards, to book parties in New York. Through love, fame, drugs, and despair, this is what it means to be part of two lives that are intertwined...and what happens when one is left behind.This is a tender, brutal book about loving the person we cannot save. It is about loyalty and being uplifted by the sheer effervescence of someone who knew how to live life to the fullest.",

        "Description": "Based on extensive research into the lives and emotions of thousands of women, this book identifies the dangers of the sacrifice syndrome for mothers and shows them how to escape it. Using dramatic examples from many women's lives, Rubenstein exposes the toll that self-denial takes on women and their families when they fool themselves into thinking that sacrifice will make them better mothers. There's the true story of the woman who worked a full-time job all night, but refused to sleep so that she could take care of her children during the day. Many mothers choose less drastic ways of sacrificing, like the woman who got up early on Thanksgiving day to cook a turkey because her husband insisted on smelling it, even though they were going out for the holiday dinner.The author shows how making a habit of sacrifice can destroy self-esteem and wear women down; she also advises women how to incorporate into their lives some time and nurturing for themselves. She reveals the benefits of becoming just a bit more selfist - taking care of one's self - instead of being overly sacrificial. And she unveils the startling news that being less sacrificial actually makes for much healthier and happier relationships with both husband and children.",

        "Authors": "By Coulter, Ann H.",
        "Description": "\u201cThe immutable fact of politics in America is this: liberals hate conservatives.\u201dAnn Coulter, whose examination of the Clinton impeachment was a major national bestseller and earned widespread praise, now takes on an even tougher issue. At a time when Democrats and Republicans should be overwhelmingly congenial, American political debate has become increasingly hostile, overly personal, and insufferably trivial. Whether conducted in Congress or on the political talk shows, played out at dinners or cocktail parties, politics is a nasty sport.At the risk of giving away the ending: It\u2019s all liberals\u2019 fault.Cultlike in their behavior, vicious in their attacks on Republicans, and in almost complete control of mainstream national media, the left has been merciless in portraying all conservatives as dumb, racist, power hungry, homophobic, and downright scary. This despite the many Republican accomplishments of the last few decades, as well as the Bush administration\u2019s expert handling of the country\u2019s affairs in the wake of the worst attacks on American soil and of the war that followed.With incisive reasoning and meticulous research, Ann Coulter examines the events and personalities that have shaped modern political discourse\u2014the bickering, backstabbing, and name-calling that have made cultural mountains out of partisan molehills. She demonstrates how the media, especially, are biased\u2014and usually wrongheaded\u2014and have done all in their power to obfuscate the issues and the people behind them, bending over backward to villainize and belittle the right, while rarely missing an opportunity to praise the left.Perhaps if conservatives had had total control over every major means of news dissemination for a quarter century, they would have forgotten how to debate, too, and would just call liberals stupid and mean. But that\u2019s an alternative universe. In this universe, the public square is wall-to-wall liberal propaganda.Refreshingly honest and unerringly timely, Slander continues where Bernard Goldberg\u2019s number one bestselling Bias left off.",

Greeley's bestselling tales of Nuala Anne McGrail, a fey, Irish-speaking woman from Galway blessed with the gift of second sight and a knack for unraveling mysteries, and her hapless husband and accomplice, Dermot Michael Coyne. From Irish Gold through Irish Stew! this spirited couple has untangled many a knotty mystery, both at home in Chicago and back in Erin. Now they return in another captivating blend of romance, humor, and intrigueDamian \"Day\" O'Sullivan is a troubled young man who blames himself for a tragic vehicular homicide he may not have committed. Trouble is, Day's entire family seems to be conspiring to pin the crime on the poor lad, which only leads Nuala and Dermot to wonder who really ran over (three times!) Rodney Keefe in the parking lot of a ritzy Chicago country club.The O'Sullivans are a ruthlessly ambitious clan of South Side Irish, who consider themselves the cream of the Irish-American community. The sensitive Day has always been something of a black sheep in the family---and perhaps a scapegoat as well.But the twisted saga of the O'Sullivans isn't the only mystery to be unraveled. Having stumbled onto the diary of Father Richard Lonigan, a nineteenth-century parish priest assigned to a remote village in old Donegal, Dermot and Nuala find themselves caught up in the closely guarded secrets and scandals of that desolate time and place, where simmering resentment against the ruling English sometimes erupted into violence and murder....Irish Cream is another rich and satisfying concoction by one of America's most popular storytellers.",

        "Title": "The Subjection of Women (Dover Thrift Editions)",
        "Authors": "By Mill, John Stuart",
        "Description": "Written in 1861 and published eight years later, this influential essay by the great English philosopher and economist is still relevant and its arguments significant. Believing that the subjugation of women was primarily political and psychological in origin, Mill urged the establishment of \"complete equality in all legal, political, social, and domestic relations between men and women.\"Arguing for both legal reforms and a social revolution, he focuses on women's exclusion from the political process, their lack of any rights in marriage, and the benefits to be obtained by their liberation. Moreover, if they are to share the freedoms enjoyed by men, equal opportunities for employment and education for women are also necessary.For its time, the work was radical and far-reaching in its demands; but despite its repeated emphasis on forms of oppression and recognition of the difficulties endured by women, it is essentially an optimistic work maintaining a firm belief that increased equality and liberty for women were inevitable.Carefully researched and clearly expressed with great logic and consistency, the book remains a landmark in the struggle for human rights. In this inexpensive edition, it will certainly be welcomed by feminists but will also appeal to anyone interested in the philosophical, human, and social issues underlying the idea of freedom and equality for all people, regardless of gender.",

To understand Easter, it is necessary to experience the entire Christian story. Like people who walk in at the end of a movie and wonder what all the fuss is about, so too Christians need to know their history--from creation to the first sin, from Christ's first miracle to his death, and everything in between.Story invites readers on a dramatic journey through the greatest story ever told. Using the power of imagery to move readers back to a place where they can encounter God, Steven James makes familiar Bible narratives come alive in provocative and poetic ways. Using thirty short, image-based chapters, Story makes the gospel real for a postmodern world and allows readers to meet Christ again or for the very first time.",

Betty Fisher and Suzanne Delzio will teach you how to employ or overcome the traits that make your dog difficult to train.  They will show how to use body language, food, voice, training structure and style to convince your stubborn dog to do what you ask.

        "Authors": "By Medoff, James L. and Harless, Andrew",
        "Description": "Over the past twenty years, the quality of life for American workers - blue-collar and white-collar, young and old, skilled and unskilled - has gone from reasonable comfort to near desperation. In this brilliantly original and compelling book, two distinguished economists show how this disastrous downward swing can be traced directly to the insidious disease of debt - not just government debt but personal and corporate debt as well.Corporate debt has engendered a downsizing movement that has drained the last vestiges of job security from the workplace. Personal debt has fueled an ongoing consumption binge and, along with government debt, has choked off investment and left America with inferior jobs, low productivity, and an ever-increasing dependence on foreign workers.Worst of all, the debt explosion has spawned a new and dangerous class, the lenders. Backed by a powerful group of apologists in academia, in government, and on Wall Street, the lenders only compound the problem of debt by pushing for higher interest rates and lower inflation, no matter what the cost. In the end, working people, the poor, and the American family pay the price.Authors Medoff and Harless go far beyond a mere diagnosis and analysis of the disease of debt; they go on to offer potent and practical prescriptions for recovery on personal, corporate, and national levels. The situation is growing desperate, as America is ensnared in a vicious circle that leads us deeper and deeper into the red. The Indebted Society is both a dramatic wake-up call for Americans and a realistic program for returning the nation to economic and social health at last.",

        "Description": "Although James Joyce began these stories of Dublin life in 1904, when he was 22, and had completed them by the end of 1907, they remained unpublished until 1914 \u2014 victims of Edwardian squeamishness. Their vivid, tightly focused observations of the life of Dublin's poorer classes, their unconventional themes, coarse language, and mention of actual people and places made publishers of the day reluctant to undertake sponsorship.Today, however, the stories are admired for their intense and masterly dissection of \"dear dirty Dublin,\" and for the economy and grace with which Joyce invested this youthful fiction. From \"The Sisters,\" the first story, illuminating a young boy's initial encounter with death, through the final piece, \"The Dead,\" considered a masterpiece of the form, these tales represent, as Joyce himself explained, a chapter in the moral history of Ireland that would give the Irish \"one good look at themselves.\" But in the end the stories are not just about the Irish; they represent moments of revelation common to all people.Now readers can enjoy all 15 stories in this inexpensive collection, which also functions as an excellent, accessible introduction to the work of one of the 20th century's most influential writers. Dubliners is reprinted here, complete and unabridged, from a standard edition.",

        "Description": "Weight-loss research shows that the average person will add 1 to 2 pounds around their abdomen each year between the ages of 35 and 55 without changing their eating or exercise habits. Noted expert Dr. C.W. Randolph explains why: \u201cestrogen dominance,\u201d a natural shift in hormone production that begins at age thirty, which causes weight gain and sabotages the most steadfast attempts at shedding it. Even worse, estrogen places the added weight around the middle, which has a negative impact both aesthetically and medically. Once estrogen dominance has taken hold, it creates a vicious cycle: fat cells will produce even more estrogen, which then biochemically predisposes the body to add on even more pounds. Here, Dr. Randolph introduces the three-step plan he\u2019s used with success in thousands of patients. In simple language, Dr. Randolph lays out the facts about bioidentical hormones and explains what foods and supplements guard against or reverse estrogen dominance. He also shares client success stories and presents practical eating plans, recipes, and shopping guides to put the advice into practice.",

        "Description": "Heyday is a brilliantly imagined, wildly entertaining tale of America\u2019s boisterous coming of age\u2013a sweeping panorama of madcap rebellion and overnight fortunes, palaces and brothels, murder and revenge\u2013as well as the story of a handful of unforgettable characters discovering the nature of freedom, loyalty, friendship, and true love.In the middle of the nineteenth century, modern life is being born: the mind-boggling marvels of photography, the telegraph, and railroads; a flood of show business spectacles and newspapers; rampant sex and drugs and drink (and moral crusades against all three); Wall Street awash with money; and giddy utopian visions everywhere. Then, during a single amazing month at the beginning of 1848, history lurches: America wins its war of manifest destiny against Mexico, gold is discovered in northern California, and revolutions sweep across Europe\u2013sending one eager English gentleman off on an epic transatlantic adventure. . . .Amid the tumult, aristocratic Benjamin Knowles impulsively abandons the Old World to reinvent himself in New York, where he finds himself embraced by three restless young Americans: Timothy Skaggs, muckraking journalist, daguerreotypist, pleasure-seeker, stargazer; the fireman Duff Lucking, a sweet but dangerously damaged veteran of the Mexican War; and Duff\u2019s dazzling sister Polly Lucking, a strong-minded, free thinking actress (and discreet part-time prostitute) with whom Ben falls hopelessly in love.Beckoned by the frontier, new beginnings, and the prospects of the California Gold Rush, all four set out on a transcontinental race west\u2013relentlessly tracked, unbeknownst to them, by a cold-blooded killer bent on revenge.A fresh, impeccable portrait of an era startlingly reminiscent of our own times, Heyday is by turns tragic and funny and sublime, filled with bona fide heroes and lost souls, visionaries (Walt Whitman, Charles Darwin, Alexis de Tocqueville) and monsters, expanding horizons and narrow escapes. It is also an affecting story of four people passionately chasing their American dreams at a time when America herself was still being dreamed up\u2013an enthralling, old-fashioned yarn interwoven with a bracingly modern novel of ideas. \"In this utterly engaging novel, the author of Turn of the Century brings 19th-century America vividly to life . . . While this is a long book, it moves quickly, with historical detail that's involving but never a drag on the action; the characters are beautifully drawn. A terrific book; highly recommended.\"  \u2013Library Journal\"Heyday is fuled by manic energy, fanatical research, and a wicked sense of humor.... It's a joyful, wild gallop through a joyful, wild time to be an American.\" -Vanity Fair",

At thirty-five, Mac has no time for marriage, children, or kinfolk - until her sisters insist she come home to help care for their widowed mother.Assuming a month in Wintergreen will be merely dreary, Mac is unprepared for what awaits her. After almost two decades of public adoration, she is suddenly a nonperson - insulted by her jealous older sister, enraged by her intractable mother, ignored by Kenny Kronek, the next-door neighbor she mercilessly taunted all through high school. A handsome divorce who dotes upon his teenage daughter, Casey, Kenny is widely respected in the community. Now he refuses to give Mac even the time of day.Once she discovers Casey is a promising country music talent, Mac assumes the role of mentor. She gradually becomes an integral part of life in Wintergreen, and the feigned indifference between Mac and Kenny turns to playful bickering, then passion. By month's end, Mac McPhail has not only grown to treasure the priceless solidarity of family and community, but also opened up her heart to love. Yet what was possible in Wintergreen appears a naive fantasy back in Nashville: Is there room for caring and commitment in the realm of superstardom - or is a woman worshipped by millions destined always to be alone?",

        "Authors": "By Berger, Joseph",
        "Description": "Every few months, American newspapers publish another dreary statistic about the country's scientific ignorance. But there are schools in the U.S. - like the Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School in New York, and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in Durham - that are exceptions to this gloomy picture, that may show the way for this country to develop the scientists and researchers we need to maintain our economic and technological stature. These are the schools that year after year win the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, the nation's most prestigious academic contest. They have evolved winning systems because, above all, they teach their students how to do research. Students do science, rather than just study it. And the students, whether they win the Westinghouse or not, go on to establish solid careers in science.Early training works. The proof is in some remarkable statistics. Five teenaged Westinghouse winners have gone on as adults to capture the Nobel Prize. Eight have been awarded MacArthur Foundation Fellowships. Twenty-eight are members of the National Academy of Science. In short, winning a Westinghouse is remarkably predictive of later success in science.Just as the best pianists and ballet dancers are those who have been taught their craft in childhood, scientists too are bred at an early age. The Young Scientists looks at what makes the winning schools and students, and at how parents and teachers can help.",

With a vivid, humorous, and too-familar scenario they show a manager loaded down by all the monkeys that have jumped from their rightful owners onto his back. Then step by step they show how managers can free themselves from doing everyone else's job and ensure that every problem is handled by the proper staff person. By using Oncken's Four Rules of Monkey Management managers will learn to become effective supervisors of time, energy, and talent -- especially their own.If you have ever wondered why you are in the office on the weekends and your staff is on the golf course, The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey is for youit's priceless!",
