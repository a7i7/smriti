Indeed, music frees Derek from the protective cocoon that his enigmatic father, an undertaker, and his devout mother created for him in their black middle-class Queens neighborhood.Derek's ambitions take him away from the comfortable predictability of his life to a tiny Times Square apartment in Manhattan. There he encounters the guts of the music industry in the 1980s: frustrated gospel singers, nefarious record producers, captivating vocal divas, the cultural stripmining of jingle writing, rebellious rap groups, and record company executives in Atlanta, L.A., and New York.The seduction of women, music, and flash take Derek around the country, with only his parents to act as his conscience: his mother admonishes against his irresponsible lifestyle. Yet it is his father's attitude that is more troubling to Derek. In the wake of their neighborhood's steady deterioration, his bitter pragmatism shocks Derek into maturity. His odyssey comes full circle, when Derek gets what he thought he wanted from life - and maybe even more.Using his own lyrics, songs of the times, and colorful anecdotes, George shows us how the threads of love - both romantic and familial - weave into the work of an artist and into building a young black man's life.",

Lena McCardell, who thought she had exactly what she wanted, discovers almost overnight that only by taking her son and joining the multitude already on the road will she have the chance of a fresh start and a brighter future.From various directions and distances, these three are inevitably drawn to this vast construction site in the Nevada desert, along with the stories of their families, their friends and their fellow travelers\u2013the novel itself developing the force of a mighty river, then channeling and harnessing its prodigious energy. With\u00a0generous understanding and\u00a0absolute authority, Bruce Murkoff captures the conflicting imperatives of these vivid lives as well as the heart and breadth of the country through which they move, and whose destiny\u00a0they help shape.",

        "Description": "Eleanor Agnes Lee, Robert E. Lee's fifth child, began her journal in December 1852 at the early age of twelve.  An articulate young woman, her stated ambitions were modest: \"The everyday life of a little school girl of twelve years is not startling,\" she observed in April 1853; but in fact, her five-year record of a southern girl's life is lively, unpredictable, and full of interesting detail.The journal opens with a description of the Lee family life in their beloved home, Arlington.  Like many military families, the Lees moved often, but Agnes and her family always thought of Arlington -- \"with its commanding view, fine old trees, and the soft wild luxuriance of its woods\" -- as home.  When Lee was appointed the superintendent of West Point, the family reluctantly moved with him to the military academy, but wherever she happened to be, Agnes engagingly described weddings, lavish dinners, concerts, and fancy dress balls.No mere social butterfly, she also recounted hours teaching slaves (an illegal act at that time) and struggling with her conscience.  Often she questioned her own spiritual worthiness; in fact, Agnes expressed herself most openly and ardently when examining her religious commitment and reflecting on death.  As pious as whe was eager to improve herself, Agnes prayed that \"He would satisfy that longing within me to do something to be something.\"In 1855 General Lee went to Texas, while his young daughter was enrolled in the elite Virginia Female Institute in Staunton.  Agnes' letters to her parents complete the picture that she has given us of herself -- an appealingly conscientious young girl who had a sense of humor, who strove to live up to her parents' expectations, and who returned fully the love so abundantly given to her.Agnes' last journal entry was made in January 1858, only three years before the Civil War began.  In 1873 she died at Lexington at the young age of thirty-two.The volume continues with recollections by Mildred Lee, the youngest of the Lee children, about her sister Agnes' death and the garden at Arlington.  \"I wish I could paint that dear old garden!\" she writes.  \"I have seen others, adorned and beautified by Kings and princes, but none ever seemed so fair to me, as the Kingdom of my childhood.\"Growing Up in the 1850s includes an introduction by Robert Edward Lee deButts, Jr., great-great-grandson of General Lee, and a historical note about Arlington House by Mary Tyler Freeman Cheek, Director for Virginia of the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association.  The editor, Mary Custis Lee deButts, is Agnes Lee's niece.",

In Providence Quinn also details his rejection of organized religion and his personal rediscovery of what he says is humankind's first and only universal religion, the theology that forms the basis for Ishmael.Providence is an insightful book that address issues of education, psychology, religion, science, marriage, and self-understanding, and will give insight to anyone who has ever struggled to forge and enact a personal spirituality.",

Determined to find out the truth, Linda makes a few predictable rookie mistakes that may just turn out to be life-threatening. When her father's case unexpectedly dovetails with Anna's disappearance, something far more calculated and dangerous than either could have imagined begins to emerge.

Narrowly escaping a British trap during the Battle of Brooklyn, Washington didn't credit his survival to courage or tactical expertise; he blamed himself for marching his men into certain doom and marveled at the Providence that delivered them. Throughout his career, Washington held fast to the conviction that America's liberty was dependent on our faithfulness to God's will and our trust in Providence. Washington's God, shows Washington not only as a man of resource, strength, and virtue, but also as a man with deeply held religious values. This new presentation of Washington-as a man whose religion guided his governance-will bring him into today's debates about the role of faith in government and will challenge everything we thought we knew about the inner life of the father of our country.",

Most are now battle-hardened veterans, and the natives of Dhrall are fierce bison hunters and bear slayers, ready to fight.But while the Vlagh's past servants were giant, venomous, and mindless bugs, it has now created perfect spies: new minions with a man's appearance and intelligence. Corrupted by the agents of the Vlagh, the human tribes are soon at one another's throats.Far, far worse for mortals is the fact that the Gods can no longer be trusted. For, nearing the end of their 25,000-year cycle, the Elder Gods are doddering toward senility and dementia. And to add to mankind's plight, a strange mysterious entity is manipulating the forces in the upcoming strife - and neither gods nor mortals know its true intentions.Now, beset by astonishing, dire challenges, Longbow and his fellow mortals must wage a bitter war against a supernatural enemy - one that has evolved in ways they could have never imagined.",

        "Authors": "By Pears, Iain",
        "Description": "A perfectly rendered short novel of suspense about a painter driven to extremes.  An influential art critic in the early years of the twentieth century journeys from London to the rustic, remote island of Houat, off France's northwest coast, to sit for a portrait painted by an old friend, a gifted but tormented artist living in self-imposed exile. Over the course of the sitting, the painter recalls their years of friendship, the double-edged gift of the critic's patronage, the power he wielded over aspiring artists, and his apparent callousness in anointing the careers of some and devastating the lives of others. The balance of power between the two men shifts dramatically as the critic becomes a passive subject, while the painter struggles to capture the character of the man, as well as his image, on canvas.  Reminiscing with ease and familiarity one minute, with anger and menace the next, the painter eventually reveals why he has accepted the commission of this portrait, why he left London suddenly and mysteriously at the height of his success, and why now, with dark determination, he feels ready to return.  Set against the dramatic, untamed landscape of Brittany during one of the most explosive periods in art history, The Portrait is rich with atmosphere and suggestion, psychological complexity, and marvelous detail. It is a novel you will want to begin again immediately after turning the last chilling page, to read once more with a watchful eye and appreciate the hand of an ingenious storyteller at work.",

        "Description": "1. A Collection of Beauties at the Height of Their Popularity is structured as a series of episodes shifting between incidents that seem separate, despite the common setting and the characters' social connections. For example, what does Gracie and Theo's befriending Margot have to do with Nash's affair with Georgia? Is it odd that these people never directly interact? Does this book feel like a novel (as opposed to a story collection)? 2. Otto's characters in this novel are constantly roving, moving quickly between jobs, apartments, and lovers. Given their transitory natures, do you think these characters find meaning in their lives? Do the characters enjoy living in a kind of day-to-day manner? What would be pleasurable about such a life? What would be difficult? Do you think the characters are grappling with larger life questions, and, if so, what do you think those questions are? 3. Throughout A Collection of Beauties , Jelly, the most visually stunning of Otto's characters, exudes a sense of separation from the people surrounding her. Do you think that beauty can set someone so far apart as to bring on a sort of loneliness? How do you think the novel defines beauty? 4. Do you think the title is ironic -- that is, are the characters in any way 'popular'? Many of them feel alienated even in their own crowded apartments and parties. Why do you think Otto gave her novel this title, besides the fact that it is the name of one of the woodblock prints in the book? 5. There has been some discussion lately about the 'second adolescence' of American twentysomethings. It is said that this phase of development is a relatively new phenomenon, beginning only with the members of the Baby Boom Generation. Do you think this is true? Do you think that the style of living Otto's characters embrace -- no commitment to anything, anyone, or any place -- has value, in any phase of life? Or does it just seem self-indulgent? 6. Is it significant that the story takes place in the early 1980s? Politically? Socially? Do you think it would change the interaction of the characters if they had cell phones and e-mail? 7. A Collection of Beauties opens and ends with excerpts from Elodie's pillow book. Why do you think Otto frames her novel with this book? Is the pillow book some sort of representation or symbol? How is it relevant to these characters' lives? 8. What is the role of art in the novel? Do the illustrations lend an atmosphere, or some kind of illumination of theme, to A Collection of Beauties ? Would the book be the same without them?",

Collected in this volume are Vidal's earlier State of the Union addresses, a tradition inaugurated on the David Susskind show in the early seventies as a counterpoint to \"whoever happened to be president.\"",

Liebling shows to us in his unforgettable New Yorker articles, brought together here so that a new generation of readers might discover Liebling as if for the first time.  Born a hundred years ago, Abbott Joseph \"Joe\" Liebling was the first of the great New Yorker writers, a colorful and tireless figure who helped set the  magazine's urbane style. Today, he is best known as a celebrant of the \"sweet science\" of boxing or as a \"feeder\" who ravishes the reader with his descriptions of food and wine. But as David Remnick, a Liebling devotee, suggests in his fond and insightful introduction, Liebling was a writer bounded only by his intelligence, taste, and ardor for life. Like his nemesis William Randolph Hearst, he changed the rules of modern journalism, banishing the distinctions between reporting and storytelling, between news and art. Whatever his role, Liebling is a most companionable figure, and to read the pieces in this grand and generous book is to be swept along on a thrilling adventure in a world of confidence men, rogues, press barons and political cronies, with an inimitable writer as one's guide.",

Mr. Fliegel shrugs and says, \"Chicks dig me.\" Or Kato, resplendent in his Three Musketeers outfit: \"One for all, blah blah blah . . . now just get me out of this @#%&ing costume!\" Or Clark, whose hobby is eating other cats' food. Tina, who somehow always just misses the litter box . . . sucker. And the guilty-looking Clarence, caught with a Barbie doll in flagrante delicto. Clarence's defiant defense: \"She was naked when I came in. . . .\"Just as Kliban got us to think about the cat as something far more interesting than an innocuous house pet, and Suzy Becker taught us that cats possess a Buddha-like wisdom (together Cat and All I Need to Know I Learned from My Cat have more than 2.6 million copies in print), Jim Edgar reveals yet another facet of the ever-mesmerizing animal.

But every step of the way, Faith has carried within her a secret  she could divulge to no one. And with it, she has kept an even more painful secret  from herself.  For Faith, it is the sudden death of her stepfather\u2014a man who, like  her husband, Alex, always remained just beyond her reach\u2014that will touch off a journey  of change and revelation. At the funeral, painful memories flood back\u2014and an old  friend reenters Faith\u2019s life. Faith is greeting mourners, when she hears a voice  behind her and a single word that brings a quick smile to her face: \u201cFred.\u201d Only  one person aside from her older brother, Jack, called her that. Brad Patterson was  Jack\u2019s best friend, a long, lanky boy who teased, tormented, and protected Faith  when they fancied themselves \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d as kids. When Jack died years  later, Faith and Brad came together again in their common, inconsolable grief, then  lost touch once more amid the demands of families and busy lives a continent apart.    Now a lawyer in California, Brad has reentered Faith\u2019s life just as she is making  a decision that plunges her marriage into crisis. Determined to fulfill a long-held  desire for a career of her own, Faith applies to law school against her husband\u2019s  wishes, igniting a barrage of anger and recrimination. Faith\u2019s only solace is the  correspondence she has begun with Brad, a man trapped in an empty marriage of his  own, a friend she once lost and has found again. Soon e-mails are flying between  them, bridging three thousand miles, sharing much-needed friendship, support, laughter.  And as these two childhood friends rediscover each other, something extraordinary  is beginning to happen. In the safety of their friendship, Brad will find the courage  to make a decision he should have made years before. And Faith, too, is changing,  beginning to believe in herself\u2014and in her right to grab hold of her dreams. Gathering  a strength she never knew she had, Faith is finally ready to face the most painful  step of all: of sharing the secret that has long been haunting her, and truly opening  up her heart for the first time in her life.   With unerring insight into the hearts  of husbands and wives, lovers and families, Danielle Steel tells a wise and moving  story of the secrets that wound and the choices that heal\u2014and of the second chances  that come only once in a lifetime.",

        "Authors": "By Ledeen, Michael A.",
        "Description": "In 1831, Alexis De Tocqueville, a twenty-six-year-old French aristocrat, spent nine months travelling across the United States. From the East Coast to the frontier, from the Canadian border to New Orleans, Tocqueville observed the American people and the revolutionary country they'd created. His celebrated Democracy in America, the most quoted work on America ever written, presented the new Americans with a degree of understanding no one had accomplished before or has since. Astonished at the pace of daily life and stimulated by people at all levels of society, Tocqueville recognized that Americans were driven by a series of internal conflicts: simultaneously religious and materialistic; individualistic and yet deeply involved in community affairs; isolationist and interventionist; pragmatic and ideological.Noted author Michael Ledeen takes a fresh look at Tocqueville's insights into our national psyche and asks whether Americans' national character, which Tocqueville believed to be wholly admirable, has fallen into moral decay and religious indifference.Michael Ledeen's sparkling new exploration has some surprising answers and provides a lively new look at a time when character is at the center of our national debate.",

        "Title": "Wrongful Death: A Novel (Lisa Drew Books)",
        "Authors": "By Kerr, Baine",
        "Description": "A man crushed between locomotives at a Wyoming switching yard...the mass murder of patients in a hospital in the former Yugoslavia...Attorney Elliot Stone was drawn into court for the trials ensuing both tragedies while trapped in a tragedy of his own, the death of his young wife, Kathleen. After two years prosecuting Balkan war crimes, he returns to Colorado to remake his life. When June, who reminds Stone of his wife, ends up in a Denver hospital comatose from a brutal beating, the court appoints him as her conservator. He gradually comes to terms with events in the presence of this helpless woman. Until June dies...  With June's daughter, her lawyer, the forensic scientist, and members of the Exhumation Unit at the war-crimes tribunal, Stone starts piecing together a three-part Chinese puzzle -- how June was assaulted, why she died five months later, what was behind the string of suspicious deaths at her hospital. And the one question that echoes through it all: How can the good do evil?  The startling answers are borne by ghosts from tragedies past -- and by the ghost of June herself -- as a spellbinding wrongful-death trial unfolds and the worlds of European war crimes and killings in a Colorado hospital converge in one twist after another.  Of Baine Kerr's Harmful Intent, Kirkus Reviews wrote, \"Kerr delivers what legal-intrigue fans crave: crackling sus-pense up top, compelling moral problems floating beneath the surface with an iceberg's menace.\" His eagerly anticipated new novel takes intrigue, menace, and moral complexity to a new dimension, an exploration of the nature of evil itself. In an intricate and supremely suspenseful tale of murder, revenge, justice, and, ultimately, love, Kerr renders courts, hospitals, and mass grave sites with utter authenticity. The electric courtroom action and powerful reverberations of provocative themes will haunt long after the triple mystery is solved.",

        "Authors": "By Kanter, Rosabeth Moss",
        "Description": "In this groundbreaking book by the bestselling author of The Change Masters and When Giants Learn to Dance, Rosabeth Moss Kanter shows how businesses and communities can harness global market forces and make them work to their advantage right here at home.At a time when the nation's fears about job displacement and foreign competition are sparking protectionist sympathies and backlash against world trade agreements, Kanter presents a persuasive and richly detailed argument for directing the American economy outward, not inward. World Class shows us how to turn globalization into an unprecedented opportunity on the local level - to rejuvenate old businesses and grow new ones, to create new jobs, to revitalize communities, and to develop the cosmopolitan cities of the future.After looking at the attitudes and prejudices that can undermine these vital new trends, Kanter examines in depth three cosmopolitan communities that have already evolved in our country, each of which has a special talent that enables it to play successfully on the world stage. The Boston area, with its abundance of universities, innovators, and entrepreneurs, excels as a \"thinker.\" Spartanburg-Greenville, South Carolina, an international manufacturing center with a high rate of foreign investment and a skilled work force, excels as a \"maker.\" The Miami area's success as a \"trader\" grows from skills in forging deals and alliances to move goods and services in international markets. Reporting on her extensive interviews with business and community leaders in these areas, Kanter believes that all three can serve as solid, successful working models for communities across America seeking to benefit from globalization.It is a two-way street, Kanter writes. Businesses must become more actively involved in their communities. And communities must actively develop those amenities and resources that will encourage global businesses to feel at home - and stay there. And finally, Kanter presents a detailed action agenda for both business and community leaders that will enable them to achieve their mutually beneficial goals.",

Anchoring her points with exhaustive research, interviews, and the testimony of people on both sides of currently explosive issues, Geyer shows us a nation in turmoil over illegal immigration, non-citizen voting, and bilingualism - and in so doing, she shows us a nation that has become more concerned with individual rights and individual identity than with the common good.",

With more than fifty pieces in all, plus a new introduction to the book by Lewis, this is a valuable collection for everyone interested in the Middle East.Here then is a rich repository of wisdom on one of the key areas of the modern world--a wealth of profound reflections on Middle Eastern history, culture, politics, and current events.",

        "Title": "Liberty and Freedom: A Visual History of America's Founding Ideas (America: a cultural history, Volume III)",
        "Authors": "By Fischer, David Hackett",
        "Description": "Liberty and freedom: Americans agree that these values are fundamental to our nation, but what do they mean? How have their meanings changed through time? In this new volume of cultural history, David Hackett Fischer shows how these varying ideas form an intertwined strand that runs through the core of American life. Fischer examines liberty and freedom not as philosophical or political abstractions, but as folkways and popular beliefs deeply embedded in American culture. Tocqueville called them \"habits of the heart.\" From the earliest colonies, Americans have shared ideals of liberty and freedom, but with very different meanings. Like DNA these ideas have transformed and recombined in each generation. The book arose from Fischer's discovery that the words themselves had differing origins: the Latinate \"liberty\" implied separation and independence. The root meaning of \"freedom\" (akin to \"friend\") connoted attachment: the rights of belonging in a community of freepeople. The tension between the two senses has been a source of conflict and creativity throughout American history. Liberty & Freedom studies the folk history of those ideas through more than 400 visions, images, and symbols. It begins with the American Revolution, and explores the meaning of New England's Liberty Tree, Pennsylvania's Liberty Bells, Carolina's Liberty Crescent, and \"Don't Tread on Me\" rattlesnakes. In the new republic, the search for a common American symbol gave new meaning to Yankee Doodle, Uncle Sam, Miss Liberty, and many other icons. In the Civil War, Americans divided over liberty and freedom. Afterward, new universal visions were invented by people who had formerly been excluded from a free society--African Americans, American Indians, and immigrants. The twentieth century saw liberty and freedom tested by enemies and contested at home, yet it brought the greatest outpouring of new visions, from Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms to Martin Luther King's \"dream\" to Janis Joplin's \"nothin' left to lose.\"Illustrated in full color with a rich variety of images, Liberty and Freedom is, literally, an eye-opening work of history--stimulating, large-spirited, and ultimately, inspiring.",

        "Description": "The critically acclaimed, beloved, and bestselling author of The Club Dumas and The Nautical Chart delivers his most magni\u00decent novel to date.  Few authors inspire the kind of passion that Arturo P\u00e9rez-Reverte does. Reviewers, readers, and booksellers alike have embraced his fiction as the perfect blend of suspense and literary ambition. A global bestseller, he is one of the most admired and widely read authors in the world. And his stunning new novel is his best yet.  A remarkable tale, The Queen of the South spans continents, from the dusty streets of Mexico to the sparkling waters off the coast of Morocco, to Spain and the Strait of Gibraltar. A sweeping story set to the irresistible beat of the drug smugglers' ballads, it encompasses sensuality and cruelty, love and betrayal, as its heroine's story unfolds.  Teresa Mendoza's boyfriend is a drug smuggler who the narcos of Sinaloa, Mexico, call \"the king of the short runway,\" because he can get a plane full of coke off the ground in three hundred yards. But in a ruthless business, life can be short, and Teresa even has a special cell phone that Guero gave her along with a dark warning. If that phone rings, it means he's dead, and she'd better run, because they're coming for her next.  Then the call comes.  In order to survive, she will have to say goodbye to the old Teresa, an innocent girl who once entrusted her life to a pinche narco smuggler. She will have to find inside herself a woman who is tough enough to inhabit a world as ugly and dangerous as that of the narcos-a woman she never before knew existed. Indeed, the woman who emerges will surprise even those who know her legend, that of the Queen of the South.",

For millennia, lions, tigers, and their man-eating kin have kept our dark, scary forests dark and scary, and their predatory majesty has been the stuff of folklore. But by the year 2150 big predators may only exist on the other side of glass barriers and chain-link fences. Their gradual disappearance is changing the very nature of our existence. We no longer occupy an intermediate position on the food chain; instead we survey it invulnerably from aboveso far above that we are in danger of forgetting that we even belong to an ecosystem. Casting his expert eye over the rapidly diminishing areas of wilderness where predators still reign, the award-winning author of The Song of the Dodo examines the fate of lions in India's Gir forest, of saltwater crocodiles in northern Australia, of brown bears in the mountains of Romania, and of Siberian tigers in the Russian Far East. In the poignant and troublesome ferocity of these embattled creatures, we recognize something primeval deep within us, something in danger of vanishing forever. 8 maps.",
