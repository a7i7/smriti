A masterful pageant of idealism, love, and adventure -- in a Paris bursting with revolutionary frenzy, and a London alive with anxious anticipation -- A Tale of Two Cities is one of Dickens's most energetic and exciting works.",

        "Description": "An unforgettable story of children in wartime, of heroism at sea, and--above all--of courage and the power of the human spirit.On September 17, 1940, at a little after ten at night, a German submarine torpedoed the passenger liner S.S. City of Benares in the North Atlantic. There were 406 people on board, but the ship's prized passengers were 90 children whose parents had elected to send their boys and girls away from Great Britain to escape the ravages of World War II. They were considered lucky, headed for quiet, peaceful, and relatively bountiful Canada.The Benares sank in half an hour, in a gale that sent several of her lifeboats pitching into the frigid sea. They were more than five hundred miles from land, three hundred miles from the nearest rescue vessel.Miracles on the Water tells the astonishing story of the survivors--not one of whom had any reasonable hope of rescue as the ship went down. The initial \"miracle\" involves one British destroyer's race to the scene, against time and against the elements; the second is the story of Lifeboat 12, missed by the destroyer and left out on the water, 46 people jammed in a craft built and stocked for 30. Those people lasted eight days on little food and tiny rations of drinking water. The survivors have grappled ever since with questions about the ordeal: Should the Benares have been better protected? How and why did they persevere? What role did faith and providence play in the outcome?Based on first-hand accounts from the child survivors and other passengers, including the author's great-uncle, Miracles on the Water brings us the story of the attack on the Benares and the extraordinary events that followed.  Tom Nagorski is currently the Executive Vice President of the Asia Society following a three-decade career in journalism - having served most recently as Managing Editor for International Coverage at ABC News. Nagorski has won eight Emmy awards and the Dupont Award for excellence in international coverage, as well as a fellowship from the Henry Luce Foundation.

Instead she heads for the Natchez Trace Parkway and the promotion that awaits her there. Almost immediately, she finds herself in the midst of controversy: as the new district ranger, she faces resentment so extreme that her ability to do her job may be compromised, and her life may very well be in danger. But all thoughts of personal safety are set aside with the discovery of a young girl's body near an overgrown country cemetery, a sheet around her head, a noose around her neck.The bizarre connection to a best-forgotten past is not the only hurdle Anna must clear in the course of the investigation. Locals reluctant to talk with a northerner - and a woman - hinder her progress; a band of Civil War reenactors questions her motives; and a vicious attack very nearly claims the life of her closest companion. Only when Anna herself is brutally beaten does the puzzle begin to come together. If she can only stay conscious long enough to make the final pieces fit...The kudzu is thick and green, the woods dark and full of secrets. And the ghosts of violence are all too present as Anna struggles for answers to questions that, perhaps, should never be asked.",

        "Description": "On a road outside Fallujah, an RPG blows apart a Humvee and upends the life of a former football star. As a medevac chopper swoops down, the wounded Guardsman hears \"Not your time, bro. Not today,\" and his remarkable healing journey begins.Thousands of U.S. soldiers have suffered grievous wounds in Iraq, but only one of them is a Doonesbury character. The Long Road Home: One Step at a Time chronicles seven months of cutting-edge cartooning, during which B.D.-and readers of the strip-got an up-close schooling in a kind of personal transformation no one seeks.Deprived not only of leg but also his ubiquitous trademark helmet, B.D. survives first-response Baghdad triage, evacuation to Landstuhl&#39;s surgeon-rich environment, and visits by innumerable morale-boosting celebs, both red and blue in hue. He&#39;s awed in turn by morphine, take-no-guff nurses, his fellow amps, and his family, including the daughter who hand-delivers succor, one aspirin at a time.Transferred stateside to Walter Reed&#39;s Ward 57, B.D. is inspired by the wisdom of physiatrists, warmed by the dedicated ministrations of real-life fellow-amp heroes like Jim the Milkshake Man, and dazzled by high-tech prostheses that cost more than luxury cars. He&#39;s annoyed by his own bouts with self-pity, by the bedside awkwardness of friends more comfortable regarding his stump from e-mail distance, and by Zonk&#39;s unwavering commitment to supplementing his care with organic meds.As their journey continues, B.D. and Boopsie are cared for by Fisher House, a home-next-door-to-the-hospital for families whose lives revolve around therapy. B.D. finds himself painfully engaged in building his future, one sadistically difficult physical therapy session at a time. \"To Lash, Helga, and the Marquis!\" toast the band of differently limbed brethren, raising their glasses to their PT masters as they prepare for reentry into the ambulatory world.From rebuilding tissue to rebuilding social skills to rebuilding lives, B.D&#39;s inspiring, insightful, and darkly humorous story confirms that it can take a village, or at least a ward, to raise a soldier when he&#39;s gone down. \"Thank you for getting blown up,\" offers one of B.D.&#39;s visiting players. Replies the coach, \"Just doing my job.\"",

        "Description": "According to Bickerton, the behavioral sciences have failed to give an adequate account of human nature at least partly because of the conjunction and mutual reinforcement of two widespread beliefs: that language is simply a means of communication and that human intelligence is the result of the rapid growth and unusual size of human brains.Bickerton argues that each of the properties distinguishing human intelligence and consciousness from that of other animals can be shown to derive straightforwardly from properties of language. In essence, language arose as a representational system, not a means of communication or a skill, and not a product of culture but an evolutionary adaptation.The author stresses the necessity of viewing intelligence in evolutionary terms, seeing it not as problem solving but as a way of maintaining homeostasis - the preservation of those conditions most favorable to an organism, the optimal achievable conditions for survival and well-being.The term protolanguage is used to describe the stringing together of symbols that prehuman hominids employed. \"It did not allow them to turn today's imagination into tomorrow's fact. But it is just this power to transform imagination into fact that distinguishes human behavior from that of our ancestral species, and indeed from that of all other species. It is exactly what enables us to change our behavior, or invent vast ranges of new behavior, practically overnight, with no concomitant genetic changes.\"Language and Human Behavior should be of interest to anyone in the behavioral and evolutionary sciences and to all those concerned with the role of language in human behavior",

        "Description": "What forces drive competition in an industry? What moves will competitors make? How will one's industry evolve? How do strategic planners respond to competitive actions? How can a firm be best positioned to compete in the long run?  Michael Porter's Competitive Strategy is the definitive work on the subject of \"competitive strategy,\" the hottest new concept in American business today. The book addresses major questions of vital concern to managers, and presents a comprehensive set of analytical techniques for understanding a business and the behavior of its competitors.  Step-by-step, Porter provides the techniques and tools managers need to successfully conduct an industry and competitor analysis. Just a few examples:     The fundamental factors determining the nature of competition in a business.   The three generic competitive strategies for coping with industry structure: cost leadership, differentiation, and \"focus.\"   How to recognize and act on \"market signals\" from competitors.   Forecasting how the structure of an industry will evolve.   The costs, risks, and returns of a \"preemptive\" strategy.   Competing effectively in an emerging industry.   Selecting new industries to enter.    Beginning with a comprehensive set of tools and techniques for analyzing any industry and any array of competitors, the book moves on to examine competitive strategies for fragmented industries, emerging industries, maturing industries, declining industries and global industries. The final section of the book provides analytical techniques for making the important strategic decisions that confront firms -- vertical integration, major capacity expansion, divestment and entry into new businesses.   This book will enable managers to anticipate and prepare for -- rather than simply react to -- sudden competitor moves, new entries into their business, and shifts in industry structure, as well as to take forceful positive action to improve a company's position through tested competitive strategies. Competitive Strategy is destined to become the Bible for Fortune 500 managers, company advisers, and securities analysts.",

        "Authors": "By Johnson, Curtis D.",
        "Description": "Through an examination of religious life in a typical northern rural locale\u2014Cortland County, New York\u2014from 1790 to 1860, Curtis D. Johnson adds to our understanding of the Second Great Awakening, an intellectual and religious watershed in American history. Offering both quantitative and qualitative analyses of churches' memberships, ideologies, and activities, he maintains that scholars have misunderstood the historical significance of evangelicalism.Johnson contends that these churches did not constitute society, nor were they microcosms of it; rather, they evolved from embattled congregations of the saved\u2014\"islands of holiness\"\u2014to ideologically conservative, organizationally unified, integrated parts of society. He uncovers the many diversities of Protestantism in the form of splits between evangelicals and non-evangelicals, formalists and anti-formalists, Arminians and Calvinists, Old School traditionalists and Oberlin perfectionists, church members and religious society members.At the heart of the revivalistic impulse, he argues, was ideological conflict\u2014primarily between Calvinists and Arminians\u2014with gender politics and internal church dynamics also contributing to the evangelical tumult. With a special interest in the Awakening's impact on congregational life, Johnson focuses on rural community experience to challenge the findings of historians who have concentrated exclusively on urban religious expression. He concludes that the importance of the various factions of evangelicalism lies in their common exhortation to republicanism and reform: these congregations, he says, influenced social change out of proportion to their numbers because activism was a central tenet of their religion.Islands of Holiness is a gem of local history. A meticulously researched book, it makes a valuable contribution to an enduring aspect of the social history of American religious expression.",

Questions to challenge, questions to provoke. Questions to entertain and expand young minds. Questions about right or wrong, about fears and hopes, ethics, religious beliefs, about why parents act the way they do--even about ruling the world.Updated to include questions on subjects that have arisen since the book's original publication in 1988--from the internet to issues like school violence and terrorism--the book is a sure way to prod young people into discovering who they really are and what they really believe. There are inquiries into values: \"If you knew you wouldn't get caught, would you cheat on a test by copying someone else's answers?\" Intriguing fantasies: \"If you could email any famous person and know they'd read and answer your note, who would you write to and what would you say?\" Philosophical queries: \"Have you had any personal experiences that lead you to believe in God?\" Provocative scenarios: \"After being given a truth pill, what would you say if you were asked to describe your family?\"Kids, and parents, will be amazed to find how far one little question will lead.",

Already twice divorced, the young Californian is too busy job-hopping to start a career, her current boyfriend insists on living \u201coff the grid,\u201d her Life Coach sister perpetually interferes with incomprehensible affirmations, her eccentric mother is busy promoting the culmination of her life\u2019s work: The Every Holiday Tree, and her father is ending his brief third marriage while scheduling two dates for the same night. Dawn\u2019s only source of security and comfort, it seems, is Chuck, a pit-bull mix from the pound. So, when her boyfriend announces that he\u2019s leaving her for another woman, a despairing Dawn turns to Chuck for solace. \u201cI should have said something sooner,\u201d Chuck confides, as he tries to console her. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you smell her on his pants?\u201d Dawn is stunned. It\u2019s one thing to talk to your pets, but what do you do when they start talking back? It\u2019s not just Chuck, either; she can hear all dogs\u2013and man\u2019s best friend has a lot to say. The ever-enthusiastic Chuck offers his tried-and-true advice on the merits of knocking over garbage and strewing it everywhere, auxiliary competitive peeing etiquette, and the curative powers of tossing a ball. Doubtful of her own sanity, Dawn considers that, in the ways of life and love, it might be better to trust Chuck\u2019s doggie instincts instead of her own. Filled with sharp wit, biting humor, and canine conversation that would make Doctor Dolittle\u2019s jaw drop, Merrill Markoe\u2019s engaging, cleverly written novel is about the confusing search for love and the divine acts of dog.From the Hardcover edition.",
