        "Title": "Here Comes Trouble: Stories from My Life",
        "Authors": "By Moore, Michael",
        "Description": "Michael Moore, Oscar-winning filmmaker, bestselling author, the nation's unofficial provocateur laureate-is back, this time taking on an entirely new role, that of his own meta-Forrest Gump.Smashing the autobiographical mold, he presents twenty-four far-ranging, irreverent, and stranger-than-fiction vignettes from his own early life. One moment he's an eleven-year-old boy lost in the Senate and found by Bobby Kennedy; and in the next, he's inside the Bitburg cemetery with a dazed and confused Ronald Reagan. At the age of seventeen, he goes to get a snack one day and ends up on the national news-creating a firestorm that helps eliminate racial discrimination at private clubs all across America. He begins his first underground newspaper in fourth grade; sixteen years later, the police are raiding the printing office of his latest publication-and the U.S. Congress steps in and takes up his fight. On top of all that, he becomes one of the youngest elected officials in the country at age eighteen-but not before planning a hilarious \"dry-run\" escape to Canada with his stoner friends just in case they get drafted to go to Vietnam. Fast-forwarding to 2003, he stuns the world from the Oscar stage by uttering the words \"We live in fictitious times ... with a fictitious president\" in place of the usual \"I'd like to thank the Academy.\"And none of that even comes close to the night the friendly priest at the seminary decides to show him how to perform his own exorcism.All of this is the stuff of great fiction-but every one of these stories is real. Before Michael Moore became the Oscar-winning filmmaker and all-around rabble-rouser and thorn-in-the-side of corporate and right-wing America, there was the guy who had an uncanny knack for just showing up where history was being made. You will be stunned and surprised to meet the Michael Moore you never knew.Capturing the zeitgeist of the past fifty years, yet deeply personal and unflinchingly honest, HERE COMES TROUBLE takes readers on an unforgettable, take-no-prisoners ride through the life and times of Michael Moore. Alternately funny, eye-opening, and moving, it's a book he has been writing-and living-his entire life.",

        "Description": "The Silk Road, which linked imperial Rome and distant China, was once the greatest thoroughfare on earth. Along it traveled precious cargoes of silk, gold and ivory, as well as revolutionary new ideas. Its oasis towns blossomed into thriving centers of Buddhist art and learning. In time it began to decline. The traffic slowed, the merchants left and finally its towns vanished beneath the desert sands to be forgotten for a thousand years; however, legends grew up of lost cities filled with treasures and guarded by demons. In the early years of the last century foreign explorers began to investigate these legends, and very soon an international race began for the art treasures of the Silk Road. Huge wall paintings, sculptures and priceless manuscripts were carried away, literally by the ton, and are today scattered through the museums of a dozen countries. Peter Hopkirk tells the story of the intrepid men who, at great personal risk, led these long-range archaeological raids, incurring the undying wrath of the Chinese.",

Eponymous, adj. Giving one's name to a person, place, or thing. Anonymous, adj. Anonymous. Anonyponymous, adj. Anonymous and eponymous. The Earl of Sandwich, fond of salted beef and paired slices of toast, found a novel way to eat them all together. Etienne de Silhouette, a former French finance minister, was so notoriously cheap that his name became a byword for chintzy practices\u2014such as substituting a darkened outline for a proper painted portrait. Both bequeathed their names to the language, but neither man is remembered. In this clever and funny book, John Bemelmans Marciano illuminates the lives of these anonyponymous persons. A kind of encyclopedia of linguistic biographies, the book is arranged alphabetically, giving the stories of everyone from Abu \"algorithm\" Al-Khwarizmi to Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin. Along with them you'll find the likes of Harry Shrapnel, Joseph-Ignace Guillotine, and many other people whose vernacular legacies have long outlived their memory. Accented by amusing line portraits and short etymological essays on subjects like \"superhero eponyms,\" Anonyponymous is both a compendium of trivia and a window into the fascinating world of etymology.  Carefully curated and unfailingly witty, this book is both a fantastic gift for language lovers and a true pleasure to read.",

Modifying traditional theory and technique, TLDP emphasizes identifying interpersonal problems currently manifested in the therapeutic relationship and, by means of the ?dynamic focus,' provides a way of focusing the therapy that is more behaviorally based and more explicit than other approaches.Clear, practical, and wise, this book?a codification of TLDP?offers an integrated model of therapy, close to clinical data, that is applicable to therapy regardless of length of treatment. It discusses in specific, concrete detail the central aspects of the therapeutic situation?from ?The Patient's Problems as a Function of Disturbed Interpersonal Relationships,' to ?The Therapist's Stance,' ?Assessment,' ?The Dynamic Focus,' ?Technique,' and ?Termination.' Rich case material is incorporated throughout and highlighted in an annotated, full-length case study that brings together all aspects of the approach. Psychotherapy in a New Key is an indispensable work for any mental health professional, in training or in practice.",

Video of the attack shows even women and children possessing almost supernatural speed and strength, consumed with a rage that makes them immune to pain, fear, and all but the most devastating injuries. Covert-One's top operative, army microbiologist Colonel Jon Smith, is sent to investigate the attack and finds evidence of a parasitic infection that for centuries has been causing violent insanity and then going dormant. This time, though, it's different. The parasite had been purposely kept alive and crudely transmitted in acts of terrorism. Now the director of Iranian Intelligence is in Uganda trying to obtain this biological weapon to unleash it on the West. Smith and his team are ambushed and cut off from all outside support just as they begin to suspect that forces much more powerful than the Iranians are in play-forces that can be traced to Washington itself.",

        "Description": "Just as culture is critical to understanding the dynamics behind any thriving community, organization, or business, the daily realities and deep structure of school life hold the key to educational success. Reforms that strive for educational excellence are likely to fail unless they are meaningfully linked to the school's unique culture. In Shaping School Culture, Terrence E. Deal and Kent D. Peterson show how leaders can harness the power of school culture to build a lively, cooperative spirit and a sense of school identity.The authors draw from over twenty years of research on school improvement as well as from their own extensive work with school leaders across the country to identify viable new strategies for effective school leadership. They describe the critical elements of culture--the purposes, traditions, norms, and values that guide and glue the community together--and show how a positive culture can make school reforms work. Deal and Peterson also explore the harmful characteristics of toxic cultures and suggest antidotes to negativity on the part of teachers, students, principals, or parents.Using real-life cases from their own research, Deal and Peterson provide concrete, detailed illustrations of exemplary practice in different school cultures. They reveal the key symbolic roles that leaders play in school change and identify the specific skills needed to change school culture successfully. Shaping School Culture provides an action blueprint for school leaders committed to transforming their schools for success.",

Yet if this is the case, shouldn t the goal of making disciples drive everything the church does? For example, shouldn t the primary job of staff members be to recruit and mentor the laity in fulfilling their own call to ministry, rather than the staff members performing the tasks of ministry themselves? Shouldn t the task of reaching out to those who have yet to answer Christ 's call to discipleship be more important than maintaining programs for those who already have? Thus, Easum opens the portal to the OtherSide, that place beyond the Christendom Era and its mechanistic, by-the-numbers approach to church life. Be prepared for a bumpy ride, with treasured assumptions, privileges, and traditions shattered along the way.",

In fact, we didn't even run a story: His death was mentioned, in one paragraph, on page 60.We didn't mean any disrespect to the King---far from it. It's just that, at the time, People was young, only three years old, and we were learning new lessons every week. We downplayed Elvis's passing because, we feared, any story about death---even that of a beloved celebrity---was too macabre a subject for the cover.We were, of course, completely, obviously, demonstrably, 100-percent wrong. Over time we learned that, when someone famous dies, readers wanted the news, a recounting of the life they often had followed for years, and, not least, a memento. Farewell cover stories, beginning with John Lennon in 1980, have, over the decades, become some of the bestselling issues in People's history. An earlier People book, Gone Too Soon, about famous people who died young, also proved popular with readers.People: Great Lives Remembered looks back at 55 celebrity tributes from the magazine's first 36 years. From Jackie Kennedy and Princess Diana to Audrey Hepburn, Frank Sinatra. Ronald Reagan, Johnny Carson, Paul Newman, Michael Jackson, John Belushi and more, they entertained, inspired or simply kept us watching.To be reminded how and why---or to learn how and why---turn the page.",
