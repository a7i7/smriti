As homeowners discover the possibilities and practicalities of installing a water garden, hybridizers are introducing water plants that can survive in every climate zone. Today there is no excuse not to give yourself over to the pleasures of a water garden.Everything you need to know to create your own water garden is in this book.

Part Two is an illustrated encyclopedia of 200 of the best plants for gardens in every area of the country. Here you'll find hardy and tropical lilies, delicate floating plants, the sacred lotus, and plants for the edge of the pond - irises, ornamental grasses, and broadleaved background plants. Here, too, are the best fish, snails, and other helpers to keep the pond pristine and the gardener entertained.",

No one has displayed the Irish tradition--which includes the earliest vernacular poetry in Western Europe--to better advantage than Kinsella has in this magnificent collection.      Divided into three \"Books,\" Book I opens with the earliest, pre-Christian poetry in Old Irish and ends in the fourteenth century with the first Irish poetry in the English language.  Book II, ranging from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, presents the age of bardic poetry and the great poetry of its decline, the \"new\" poetry in Irish that followed it, and the era of Swift and Goldsmith.  Book III covers the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from the beggar-poet Raifteiri in Irish and his English-language contemporary Thomas Moore, to the work of a number of poets born around the time of Yeats' death.",

Which is to say, he makes a very good living flying around the world dispensing premonitory wisdom, a.k.a. pre-packaged B.S., to world governments, corporations, and global leadership conferences. He is an optimist by trade and a cynic by choice. He\u2019s the kind of man who can give a lecture on successive days to a leading pesticide manufacturer and the Organic Farmers of America, and receive standing ovations at both. But just as the American Empire is beginning to fray around the edges, so too is Yates\u2019 carefully scripted existence. On the way to the Futureworld Conference in Johannesburg he opens a handwritten note from his girlfriend, informing him she\u2019s left him for a fifth-grade history teacher. Then he witnesses a soccer riot in which five South Africans are killed, to the chagrin of the South African P.R. people at Futureworld. Fueled by a heroic devastation of his minibar and inspired by the rookie hooker sent to his hotel room by his hosts, Yates composes a spectacularly career-ending speech at Futureworld, the delivery of which leads to a sound beating, a meeting with some quasi-governmental creeps, and a hazy mission to go around the world answering the question Why does everyone hate us?Thus begins an absolutely original novel that is driven by equal parts corrosively funny satire, genuine physical fear, and heartfelt moral anguish. From the hideously ugly Greenlander nymphomaniacal artist to the gay male-model spy to the British corporate magnate with a taste for South Pacific virgin sacrifice rituals, The Futurist manages to be wildly entertaining and deadly serious at the same time. Wry, picaresque, and a wicked barb aimed at all that is fatuous, The Futurist is the story of a pundit who finds his audience when he proclaims he knows nothing.",

        "Description": "From the author of Good Muslim, Bad Muslim comes an important book, unlike any other, that looks atthe crisis in Darfur within the context of the history of Sudan and examines the world\u2019s response to that crisis.In Saviors and Survivors, Mahmood Mamdani explains how the conflict in Darfur began as a civil war (1987\u201489) between nomadic and peasant tribes over fertile land in the south, triggered by a severe drought that had expanded the Sahara Desert by more than sixty miles in forty years; how British colonial officials had artificially tribalized Darfur, dividing its population into \u201cnative\u201d and \u201csettler\u201d tribes and creating homelands for the former at the expense of the latter; how the war intensified in the 1990s when the Sudanese government tried unsuccessfully to address the problem by creating homelands for tribes without any. The involvement of opposition parties gave rise in 2003 to two rebel movements, leading to a brutal insurgency and a horrific counterinsurgency\u2013but not to genocide, as the West has declared.Mamdani also explains how the Cold War exacerbated the twenty-year civil war in neighboring Chad, creating a confrontation between Libya\u2019s Muammar al-Qaddafi (with Soviet support) and the Reagan administration (allied with France and Israel) that spilled over into Darfur and militarized the fighting. By 2003, the war involved national, regional, and global forces, including the powerful Western lobby, who now saw it as part of the War on Terror and called for a military invasion dressed up as \u201chumanitarian intervention.\u201dIncisive and authoritative, Saviors and Survivors will radically alter our understanding of the crisis in Darfur.",

They who endure will be     the Victors.            After three centuries, the Morgan family?s spiritual heritage is waning.     Gone are the days when Morgans struggled against religious persecution, carved     civilization out of the wilderness, and fought to defeat slavery. Now, as the     Nazi menace engulfs Europe and Japanese militarism threatens the Pacific, the     four young adult children of Johnny and Laura Morgan show small concern. Preoccupied     with big bands, movies, radio, and sports, they care little about spiritual     things.        When a family reunion in San Diego is disrupted by news of Japan?s attack     on Pearl Harbor, Johnny and Laura?s efforts to rekindle their children?s     interest in their roots are seemingly smothered. Within months, Alexandra, Walt,     Nat, and Lily are scattered abroad, placed in situations that test their faith     and endanger their lives.        On the homefront, Johnny and Laura face rationing and threats of Japanese invasion.     Then, like the Old Testament account of Job, come four messages bearing ill     tidings about the fate of their children. Shaken by the news, Johnny and Laura     are confronted by the possible extinction of an entire generation. With nowhere     else to turn but God, they discover that in the blackest night His light shines     brightest.",

        "Description": "If she had been \"active in the court of Louis XIV,\" wrote designer Oliver Smith, Agnes de Mille \"probably would have changed the history of the world.\" Indeed, Agnes did change the world - of dance. Pioneering a distinctive American style that combined elements of modern dance and ballet with a traditional folk idiom, Agnes popularized what had been an elitist art and irrevocably changed the American musical theater with her dances for Oklahoma!, Carousel, Brigadoon, and other smash Broadway musicals. Two of her ballets, Rodeo and Fall River Legend, are timeless classics.No Intermissions is the first comprehensive biography of this giant on the American cultural scene. During a life that spanned most of this century, de Mille worked and played with a fabulous cast of characters, beginning with her family (her father was writer-director William, her uncle, the legendary Hollywood director Cecil B.) and later expanding to include Charlie Chaplin, Martha Graham, Cole Porter, Noel Coward, Rebecca West, Anthony Tudor, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, and Mikhail Baryshnikov.Drawing on unpublished papers and extensive interviews with friends, colleagues, relatives, and de Mille herself, acclaimed author Carol Easton takes us behind the scenes with Agnes de Mille - who was not only a dancer and a choreographer, but also the first woman to direct a Broadway musical, first woman president of a national labor union, bestselling author, and passionate advocate for the arts. She could be abrasive, stubborn, and rude - Jule Styne called her \"a killer\" - but she could also be loyal, generous, and understanding. Her staunchest critics acknowledged her courage and, even in the worst of times, her wit.",

        "Description": "In 1997 and early 1998, one of the most powerful El Ni\u00f1os ever recorded disrupted weather patterns all over the world. Europe suffered through a record freeze as the American West was hit with massive floods and snowstorms; in the western Pacific, meanwhile, some island nations literally went bone dry and had to have water flown in on transport planes.Such effects are not new: climatologists now know the El Ni\u00f1o and other climate anomalies have been disrupting weather patterns throughout history. But until recently, no one had asked how this new understanding of the global weather system related to archaeology and history. Droughts, floods, heat and cold put stress on cultures and force them to adapt. What determines whether they adapt successfully? How do these climate stresses affect a people\u2019s faith in the foundations of their society and the legitimacy of their rulers? How vulnerable is our own society to climate change?In this dazzlingly original new book, archaeologist Brian Fagan shows that short-term climate shifts have been a major?and hitherto unrecognized?force in history. El Ni\u00f1o-driven droughts have brought on the collapse of dynasties in Egypt; El Ni\u00f1o monsoon failures have caused historic famines in India; and El Ni\u00f1o floods have destroyed whole civilizations in Peru. Other short-term climate changes may have caused the mysterious abandonment of the Anasazi dwellings in the American Southwest and the collapse of the ancient Maya empire, as well as changed the course of European history.This beautifully written, groundbreaking book opens a new door on our understanding of historical events.",

To get lean, you have to be extreme\u2026right? Wrong. Dieting is a zero-sum game. You can lose weight fast, but more than a third of people regain all of the weight they've lost within a year. So why waste time following someone else's diet advice when you can drop the pounds on your own terms? With Lose It! by Charles Teague and Anahad O'Connor, the power to lose weight is in your hands. No deprivation, no detox, no hard-and-fast rules\u2014just a plan that empowers you to create your own, personalized strategy tailored to your individual lifestyle, schedule, dietary needs, and goals. Despite what many \"experts\" would lead you to believe, weight loss boils down to simple math: calories in vs. calories out. To shed pounds, you have to end each day with a calorie deficit. It sounds easy enough, but studies show that 63 percent of Americans grossly underestimate their daily calorie intake. In fact, the average American consumes a staggering 3,790 calories a day\u2014that's enough calories to gain more than 10 pounds every month! Lose It!'s life-changing philosophy and program have already helped more than 5 million people lose weight. In this, the first-ever book to be developed from an iPhone app, readers will learn the five pillars of the Lose It! strategy: 1. Embrace mindful empowerment: Take control of your body and the foods you put in it. 2. Track your calories: There are no points or complicated algorithms to follow. But every snack, taste, and bite counts! 3. Track your habits. Spot behavior patterns\u2014good and bad\u2014that you can modify to help you meet your goal. 4. Track your exercise. Learn how to burn more calories in less time and boost your calorie burn even when you're not at the gym. 5. Benefit from peer support. Your social network inspires you, keeps you accountable, and provides insight and advice. With Lose It!, you can forget about following someone else's idea of what you should and shouldn't eat and simply learn to love food again. The best possible weight loss plan, after all, is the one that you design yourself.",

I felt the air leave me in a quiet rush. Not because of the way the photo captured her fleeting youth, but because of the way it highlighted the bruise.It was a photo of me.Rachel Price has just one happy memory from her childhood: the moment her father took her hands while playing outside on a cold, snowy day and called her his angel. It was a rare and sacred moment in her young life, one in which she finally felt safe, loved, and protected.But it didn\u2019t last long.Years later, Rachel\u2019s daughter is the only light in what has become a dark life. Rachel repeats the patterns she learned as a child and exposes her own daughter to those same destructive behaviors. Consumed by an abusive marriage, but secure in the safety of the familiar, she is too afraid to escape.Rachel accepts what her life has become, even as she makes excuses for those who keep her in a constant state of despair and regret. But then, an unexpected phone call from an old friend changes everything. Her ordered world is turned upside down as she\u2019s set on a journey that might be her last chance to salvage the life she\u2019d given up on long ago.While new friendships tentatively blossom, Rachel realizes that everything she once believed may be nothing but lies and misunderstandings. But knowing the truth is not as easy as it seems. Sometimes ignorance truly is bliss. As the snow falls and the promise of Christmas redemption nears, Rachel begins to see her entire childhood in a brand-new light and must now decide what her future holds\u2014and what her past really means. Will knowing the truth set her free, or will it condemn her to a life full of regret and \u201cwhat ifs\u201d?The Snow Angel is a poignant tale about family, forgiveness, and the freedom to live a future free of the past.",

For hundreds of years, Christians have prepared for Christmas by carefully observing the four-week season leading up to it. What\u2019s more, when Christmas did arrive, they celebrated not just for one day but for twelve! So four weeks for Advent and nearly two weeks for Christmas makes six weeks, which is why Ann Spangler has prepared this six-week Christmas devotional. Drawing from her bestselling books Praying the Names of God and Praying the Names of Jesus, Spangler selected six names or titles\u2014including Immanuel, Yeshua, and Bright Morning Star. Each name offers a week\u2019s worth of devotions focusing on God, the miraculous birth of his son, and the promise of his return. In Immanuel, you\u2019ll discover a perfect balance of prayer, reflection, and study to help you open your heart fully to the birth of Jesus and all that it means.",

And from the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster to Hurricane Katrina, he\u2019s shown an astounding ability to beat the odds (and beat the bureaucrats) to get things done.Then again, Jindal is not your typical politician. The son of Indian immigrants, a Christian convert from Hinduism, and a Rhodes Scholar, Jindal presided over Louisiana\u2019s healthcare system at age 24, headed the University of Louisiana system at 27, became a U.S. congressman at 33, and was elected governor of Louisiana at 36.Throughout his meteoric career, Jindal has dealt with some of the worst crises of our times, from natural disasters in his home state to out-of-control spending in Washington, D.C. His secret: the common sense solutions that bureaucrats (and politicians) ignore in favor of government\u2013as\u2013usual.In Leadership and Crisis, Jindal reveals:  How the Obama administration spent too much time worrying about public perception and not enough on actually fighting the oil How the federal government actually impeded Louisiana\u2019s efforts to stem the flood of oil Why the bureaucratic incompetence during Hurricane Katrina was even worse than you know How Bobby Jindal took on Louisiana\u2019s infamous culture of corruption His own journey from Hinduism to Christianity, from student at Oxford to Governor of Louisiana, from policy wonk to instant midwife when he had to deliver his third child himself Filled with behind\u2013the\u2013scenes stories from the oil\u2013slicked beaches of Louisiana to the corridors of power in the U.S. Capitol, Leadership and Crisis offers an insider\u2019s view into one of the worst environmental disasters our nation has suffered\u2014and into one of the most unique success stories of American politics.",
