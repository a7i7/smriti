Love stories depend on disappointment, on unequal births and feuding families, on matrimonial boredom and at least one cold heart. Love stories, nearly without exception, give love a bad name . . . .It is perhaps only in reading a love story (or in writing one) that we can simultaneously partake of the ecstasy and agony of being in love without paying a crippling emotional price. I offer this book, then, as a cure for lovesickness and an antidote to adultery. Read these love stories in the safety of your single bed. Let everybody else suffer.\"\u2014Jeffrey Eugenides, from the introduction to My Mistress's Sparrow Is DeadAll proceeds from My Mistress's Sparrow is Dead will go directly to fund the free youth writing programs offered by 826 Chicago. 826 Chicago is part of the network of seven writing centers across the United States affiliated with 826 National, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting students ages 6 to 18 with their creative and expository writing skills, and to helping teachers inspire their students to write.",

Julia and Valentina Poole are semi-normal American twenty-year-olds with seemingly little interest in college or finding jobs. Their attachment to one another is intense. One morning the mailman delivers a thick envelope to their house in the suburbs of Chicago. From a London solicitor, the enclosed letter informs Valentina and Julia that their English aunt Elspeth Noblin, whom they never knew, has died of cancer and left them her London apartment. There are two conditions to this inheritance: that they live in it for a year before they sell it and that their parents not enter it. Julia and Valentina are twins. So were the estranged Elspeth and Edie, their mother.The girls move to Elspeth's flat, which borders the vast and ornate Highgate Cemetery, where Christina Rossetti, George Eliot, Radclyffe Hall, Stella Gibbons and Karl Marx are buried. Julia and Valentina come to know the living residents of their building. There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword-puzzle setter suffering from crippling obsessive compulsive disorder; Marijke, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including - perhaps - their aunt.",

His new book, Teaching Reading to Black Adolescent Males offers teachers and schools a way to reconceptualize literacy instruction for those who need it most.Alfred bridges the connections among theory, instruction, and professional development to create a roadmap for better literacy achievement. He presents practical suggestions for providing reading strategy instruction and assessment that is explicit, meaningful, and culturally responsive, as well as guidelines for selecting and discussing nonfiction and fiction texts with black males. The author's first-hand insights provide middle school and high school teachers, reading specialists, and administrators with new perspectives to help schools move collectively toward the essential goal of literacy achievement for all.",

        "Description": "The growth of mental health professionals in recent years has been matched with a proliferation of psychotherapeutic approaches. Even within psychoanalytic psychotherapy there are many schools of thought. This landmark book represents the position of mainstream psychoanalytic thinking and practice on psychotherapy.The contributors are all classically trained analysts and members of the American Psychoanalytic Association. They base their work on the concepts of modern structural theory with its emphasis on the central role of unconscious intrapsychic conflict. This book offers a comprehensive description and application of these principles to the process of psychotherapy. Its goal is to function as a guide to psychoanalytic psychotherapy, differentiating the process from both psychoanalysis and other forms of psychotherapy.The book offers a consistent psychoanalytic approach from the introductory general principles of psychotherapy through the assessment and selection of suitable patients; the establishment of the psychotherapy setting; the role of transference, countertransference, and extratransference interpretation; the nature of interpretation and the tactics of its use; the role of dreams and acting out; and its application to those forms of psychopathology most commonly encountered in the practice of adult outpatient psychotherapy. It also includes chapters on psychosomatic disorders, the use of medication in conjunction with psychotherapy, and the therapist's gender in relation to the patient. The scope and depth of the book serve the needs not only of beginning psychotherapists but also of those who are experienced clinicians.",

Part memoir, part observation of modern marriage, and part meditation on the roles of God and love in our everyday lives, MARRIAGE AND OTHER ACTS OF CHARITY is a unique and unforgettable look into why, and how, we love each other, and proves yet again why Kate Braestrup's writing is \"inspirational in the best sense\" (New York Daily News).",

        "Authors": "By Tobin, Joseph Jay, Wu, David Y. H., and Davidson, Dana H.",
        "Description": "As the numbers of mothers in the workforce grows, the role of the extended family diminishes, and parents feel under greater pressure to give their children an educational headstart, industrialized societies are increasingly turning to preschools to nurture, educate, and socialize young children. Drawing on their backgrounds in anthropology, human development, and education, Tobin, Wu, and Davidson present a unique comparison of the practices and philosophies of Japanese, Chinese, and American preschool education and discuss how changes in childcare both reflect and affect larger social change.      \u00a0      The method used is innovative: the authors first videotaped a preschool in each culture, then showed the tapes to preschool staff, parents, and child development experts. Through their vivid descriptions of a day in each country's preschools, photographs made from their videotapes, and Chinese,\u00a0Japanese, and American evaluations of their own and each other's schools, we are drawn into a multicultural discussion of such issues as freedom, conformity, creativity, and discipline.      \u00a0      In\u00a0China, for example, preschools are expected to provide an antidote to the spoiling that Chinese fear is inevitable in an era of single-child families. Americans look to preschools not only to teach reading and to encourage children to be creative, expressive, and independent but also to provide a stability and richness otherwise missing from many children's lives. Japanese\u00a0preschools, surprisingly for many Americans, deemphasize discipline and academics and instead stress the teaching of group interaction to a generation of overly sheltered children. In all three nations, preschools, rather than being radical or transforming, function to conserve values believed to be threatened by social change.",

The news has thrown the Council of Kings into a furor and drained the spirit from once united factions.

        "Description": "When you hear the word disciple, you may envision people who spend all day praying and converting the masses. Or individuals who have a natural holiness deep inside. The truth is, being a follower of Jesus isn\u2019t a job for the perfect or the Christian elite\u2014it\u2019s something anyone can and should be. (And even the original twelve disciples were far from perfect!) This thirty-day devotional looks at the traits real, very humandisciples have, using Scripture, first-person comments from teens, and questions that help you think about your own disciple experiences.When you think of Peter, John, Matthew, and even Paul, they seem to be heroes for Jesus\u2014the ones we\u2019re supposed to emulate and be more like. After all, Jesus handpicked them to be his followers and ambassadors on earth, and trusted them with everything when he left, so they must have been really holy men, right?But if you read the Gospels and Acts closely, you\u2019ll notice the men Jesus called into his ministry were often clueless, selfish, afraid, and brash, and made a lot of mistakes during their time as disciples. In other words, they were very human. Just like you. This 30-day devotional peels back the holy veneer and explores the character traits that mark all disciples\u2014things like fear, boldness, doubt, laziness, weakness, sensitivity, brokenness, alienation, hunger, immaturity, strength, and preparedness\u2014and uses Scripture, real-world examples, and questions with space to journal to help you see these \u201cnegative\u201d qualities actually qualify you to follow Jesus. Because discipleship isn\u2019t something from the first century, and Jesus is calling you to follow him today.Devotion:can be used for personal study or in a group settingis ideal for teens and young adultscontains short readings, with full Scripture passages included, that you can take with you anywherebreaks down the real truth behind Scripture to show how it applies to your life today",

Despite being out of the game, Ron never lost his nose for trouble. And as all good reporters know, sometimes trouble has a tendency of getting the scoop on you instead of the other way around.After receiving a cryptic message from an old friend, Ron takes the first train from Washington D.C. to New York City--and quickly finds himself in a deadly chase after a friend and long-trusted news source ends up dead in a mysterious accident near his home in Paris. Wright, thrust into the lead of a lifetime key, must connect this bizarre turn of events to unlock one of the most cover-up secrets of the modern era: Saudi Arabian royalty has long provided funding for a powerful group in America . . . funds that have been accumulating to launch the single most vicious attack on American soil. Beginning in France and stretching across the Middle East, Ron Wright, must enlist the help of a beautiful journalist from Al-Jazeera, to uncover the story of the century. Dodging the hail of flying bullets, running from international terrorists, and doing his best to escape those who would stop his story from ever reaching print, Ron Wright - who used to feel the most comfortable behind a computer - now finds himself under the gun...and the term \"deadline\" may soon have a whole new meaning.",

Inordinately fond of train travel, he takes us on a journey over a career spanning thirty years and distills it into poignant episodes. From his early education by his eccentric Uncle Hal, an unlikely author and lover of dog biscuits, we are taken through Theroux's years as a fledgling novelist in literary London, under the wing of the rapacious Lady Max, to his grief at finding himself along again, at age fifty, in the town of his youth.With enormous insight and self-knowledge Theroux divulges his belief in secrets: the fake occupations he has given himself - particle physicist, cartographer, teacher; the false names with which he has misled people; the absurd events of his life, including a run-in with a deluded fan who has recommended to him the writings of the more famous Paul Theroux; and his uncanny meeting with an elderly German writer whose life has almost exactly mirrored his own.",
