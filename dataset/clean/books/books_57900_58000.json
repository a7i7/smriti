        "Authors": "By DIRECT SELLING WOMEN'S ALLIANCE",
        "Description": "Millions of people around the world are involved in direct selling. There are 12 million in the United States alone! Almost 74 percent of direct sellers are women. An estimated 46 million people in the world are involved in direct selling, according to the Direct Selling Association. In less than ten years this number is expected to grow to an unbelievable 200 million! With more people looking for careers that offer independence, flexibility, and tremendous income potential, this book offers a one-stop source of nuts-and-bolts advice, insights, and practical sales skills. Build It Big: 101 Insider Secrets from Top Direct Selling Experts addresses the three most popular models of direct selling: * network marketing (e.g., Amway) * party planning (e.g., Pampered Chef) * person-to-person(e.g., Guardian Life Insurance) The training that many of these companies offer is limited and typically covers only product features and benefits, basic sales techniques, recruitment, and order processing. Through extensive research, the Direct Selling Women's Alliance (DSWA) has identified four crucial \"\"life skills\"\" that often are neglected or omitted from a company's training and support program: * Financial and tax guidance. * Coaching and leadership skills development. * Business management and technology training. * Daily success practices and implementation. Build It Big unveils the methods and approaches in developing these skills that, DSWA believes, are the true linchpins of growth and long-term sales stability. The disciplined approach and real-life insights from some of the most successful and talented people in the direct selling business will have broad appeal to rookies and veterans alike, especially for people who are opting for direct selling for part-time work, extra income, and the autonomy it offers.",

Even after they achieved the first heavier-than-air, powered flight in the dunes of Kill Devil Hills on December 17, 1903, they remained obscure. But by the time of Orville\u2019s last flights on the Outer Banks in 1911, they were two of the most famous men of the twentieth century. In First in Flight, author Stephen Kirk describes in marvelous detail the undeniable influence that the landscape and people of the Outer Banks had on the Wright Brothers\u2019 quest for flight and, in turn, the lasting effect that the Wright brothers\u2019 success had on this once-desolate region. With its lively and often humorous narrative, First in Flight presents a broader context for the Wrights\u2019 activities on the Outer Banks than any other book about the famous brothers. It details every aspect of the Wrights\u2019 life on the North Carolina coast\u2014the lifesavers they associated with, the local citizens they befriended, the other outsiders who came to the Outer Banks to participate in and report on their experiments, the Wrights\u2019 perspective on local lifestyles, and the locals\u2019 perspective on them.",

        "Description": "Tim Junkin's fast-paced insider novel tracks a moral journey. Jack Stanton began his career as a public defender in the Washington, D.C., \"Agency.\" A quick study and a charismatic trial lawyer, Jack believed wholeheartedly in indigent clients' rights to the best legal defense possible. He worked tirelessly and won some tough cases against the District's corps of prosecuting attorneys. His reputation for expert client preparation grew alongside his passion for winning.Ultimately, however, Jack pays for that reputation with his integrity. And, for his workaholism, he pays with his marriage. By the time he decides to leave the Agency to establish his own private law practice, his line between truth and manipulated fact has thinned to almost nothing. And so, specializing in medical malpractice cases, Jack succeeds brilliantly until he obscures that thin line altogether and is charged with lying under oath.He runs, hiding out in a secluded house on the Chesapeake Bay. It's there that he encounters an idealistic young woman plotting to avenge her father's murder by terrorists. Her plight leads Jack to act once again on behalf of an underdog and to regain-at least for himself-his own idealism and honor.With its intriguing cast of the accused and their defenders, Good Counsel dramatically illustrates the process and practice of litigation. It's a knowing, taut, suspenseful novel that confronts the high price of professional success.",

        "Title": "Ordinary Resurrections",
        "Authors": "By Kozol, Jonathan",
        "Description": "In a stirring departure from his earlier work, Jonathan Kozol has written his most personal and hopeful book to date, an energized and unexpected answer to the bleakness of Death at an Early Age, the classic that he published more than 30 years ago.Like his most recent book, Amazing Grace, this work also takes place in New York's South Bronx; but it is a markedly different book in mood and vantage point, because we see life this time through the eyes of children, not, as the author puts it, from the perspective of a grown-up man encumbered with a Harvard education. Here, too, we see devoted teachers in a good but underfunded public elementary school that manages, against all odds, to be a warm, inviting, and protective place; and we see the children also in the intimate religious setting of a church in which they are watched over by the vigilant grandmothers of the neighborhood and by a priest whose ministry is, first and foremost, to the very young.A work of guarded optimism that avoids polemic and the fevered ideologies of partisan debate, Ordinary Resurrections is a book about the little miracles of stubbornly persistent innocence in children who are still unsoiled by the world and still can view their place within it without cynicism or despair.The author's personal involvement with specific children deepens as the narrative evolves. A Jewish man, now 63 years old, he finds his own religious speculations growing interwoven with the moral and religious explorations of the children, some of whom have been his friends for nearly seven years. The children change, of course, from year to year as they learn more about the world; but the author is changed also by the generous and tender ways in which the children, step by step, unlock their secrets and unveil the mysteries of their belief to him.",

        "Title": "The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)",
        "Authors": "By Johnson, Chalmers",
        "Description": "\"Impressive . . . a powerful indictment of U.S. military and foreign policy.\" -Los Angeles Times Book Review, front page In the years after the Soviet Union imploded, the United States was described first as the globe's \"lone superpower,\" then as a \"reluctant sheriff,\" next as the \"indispensable nation,\" and in the wake of 9/11, as a \"New Rome.\" In this important national bestseller, Chalmers Johnson thoroughly explores the new militarism that is transforming America and compelling us to pick up the burden of empire.Recalling the classic warnings against militarism-from George Washington's Farewell Address to Dwight Eisenhower's denunciation of the military-industrial complex-Johnson uncovers its roots deep in our past. Turning to the present, he maps America's expanding empire of military bases and the vast web of services that support them. He offers a vivid look at the new caste of professional militarists who have infiltrated multiple branches of government, who classify as \"secret\" everything they do, and for whom the manipulation of the military budget is of vital interest. Among Johnson's provocative conclusions is that American militarism is already putting an end to the age of globalization and bankrupting the United States, even as it creates the conditions for a new century of virulent blowback. The Sorrows of Empire suggests that the former American republic has already crossed its Rubicon-with the Pentagon in the lead.",

        "Title": "Dumbing Down Our Kids: Why America's Children Feel Good About Themselves but Can't Read, Write, or Add",
        "Authors": "By Sykes, Charles J.",
        "Description": "In this book, Sykes argues that the school wars of the 1990s will be the defining cultural and political debate of our time. While many parents bask in the glow of complacency about their own children's education, Dumbing Down Our Kids documents the collapse of standards in our schools, the flight from learning, and the triumph of mediocre, feel-good education that is more concerned with pumping up self-esteem than it is with passing on knowledge.This dubious triumph includes the latest educational fad, \"Outcome Based Education.\" Although known by different names in some states, OBE is the most recent in a long series of \"reforms\" that have eroded our schools. Charles Sykes traces these fads from their roots in the early \"progressive\" theories of John Dewey, through Dick and Jane and Spot, Life Adjustment, New Math, Mastery Learning, and other reforms-gone-wrong.Sykes concludes with a checklist for parents, students, and teachers who want to evaluate their schools, and a series of recommendations to restore quality learning to America.",
