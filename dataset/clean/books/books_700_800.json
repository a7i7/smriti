        "Title": "Hollywood vs. America: The Explosive Bestseller that Shows How-and Why-the Entertainment Industry Has Broken Faith With Its Audience",
        "Authors": "By Medved, Michael",
        "Description": "Why does our popular culture seem so consistently hostile to the values that most Americans hold dear? Why does the entertainment industry attack religion, glorify brutality, undermine the family, and deride patriotism? In this explosive book, one of the nation's best known film critics examines how Hollywood has broken faith with its public, creating movies, television, and popular music that exacerbate every serious social problem we face, from teenage pregnancies to violence in the streets. Michael Medved powerfully argues that the entertainment business follows its own dark obsessions, rather than giving the public what it wants: In fact, the audience for feature films and network television has demonstrated its profound disillusionment in recent years, with disastrous consequences for many entertainment companies.  Meanwhile, overwhelming numbers of our fellow citizens complain about the wretched quality of our popular culture--describing the offerings of the mass media as the worst ever.  Medved asserts that Hollywood ignores--and assaults--the values of ordinary American families, pursuing a self-destructive and alienated ideological agenda that is harmful to the nation at large and to the industry's own interests. In hard-hitting chapters on \"The Attack on Religion,\" \"The Addiction to Violence,\" \"Promoting Promiscuity,\" \"The Infatuation with Foul Language,\" \"Kids Know Best,\" \"Motivations for Madness,\" and other subjects, Medved outlines the underlying themes that turn up again and again in our popular culture.  He also offers conclusive evidence of the frightening real-world impact of these messages on our society and our children. Finally, Medved shows where and how Hollywood took a disastrous wrong turn toward its current crisis, and he outlines promising efforts both in and outside the industry to restore a measure of sanity and restraint to our media of mass entertainment.Sure to elicit strong response, whether it takes the form of cheers of support or howls of enraged dissent, Hollywood vs. America confronts head-on one of the most significant issues of our times.",

Nicole is a surprise; just graduated from high school-almost an adult-the gap between the little girl Henry once knew and the woman she has become leaves him fumbling for words. Days after Nicole arrives, Henry's girlfriend, Elizabeth, reveals that she is pregnant. Henry is speechless at these two events, throwing into sharp relief his emotional landscape. He best deals with situations like these by heading off to the racetrack in time to make the daily double, and to place a few bets.As Rick Bass writes, \"a beautiful and aching novel, alarming in its wisdom and treatment of one of the great terrors, loneliness, and one of the great mercies, forgiveness.\"",

        "Authors": "By Hundt, Reed E.",
        "Description": "This book is a unique account of the way politics has shaped the information age in America. Reed E. Hundt, chairman from 1993 to 1997 of the Federal Communications Commission, the nation\u2019s chief regulatory agency for media and communications industries, tells of the battles for political advantage that lie behind the enormous creation of wealth and social changes that are generally called the \u201cNew Economy.\u201d The central theme of the narrative is the surprising passage and fascinating implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which authorized the Federal Communications Commission to replace monopoly with competition and to guarantee access to the Internet to all Americans, including every child in every classroom.Depending on the leadership of his high school classmate Al Gore and finding unexpected allies in the ranks of free market ideologues, Hundt led the FCC to make the decisions that helped start a wave of entrepreneurship, which in turn has given the United States the world\u2019s leading Internet economy. As the memoir shows, every decision involved prodigious political battles\u2014between existing industries and start-ups, between Newt Gingrich and the Clinton-Gore White House, between inside-the-Beltway lobbyists and the new grassroots advocacy of e-mails, between the politics of money and the politics of ideas. In the same period, the often ignored and historically maligned FCC was the place where government decided whether to undertake the largest national initiative to reform K\u201312 education in the country\u2019s history: the program to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2001.Hundt\u2019s report from the political battlefield offers significant insight into the motives and personality not only of Al Gore but other prominent figures in political life, as well as many of the media moguls of our time. Told with great energy and wit, it is a tale that inspires both concern for and confidence in our democracy in the information age.",

        "Description": "Alliances between companies have become a crucial weapon in the battle for competitive advantage. Managed wisely, a strategic alliance can help companies develop and exploit their unique strengths. For example, a large company can break down the marketing barriers that face a small company, which in turn brings entrepreneurial creativity to the partnership. An alliance can also be a powerful tool for accessing new technology and developing domestic or international business opportunities.Yet many companies mismanage their alliances, leading to wasted money, time, and effort, sometimes with disastrous results. In Intelligent Business Alliances, consultant Larraine Segil shows how to establish and manage winning alliances, starting with the crucial process of picking the right partner and creating realistic expectations on both sides. Segil then explains how to analyze the corporate and individual personality types involved in an alliance, using her unique Mindshift approach, which can help managers forecast and avoid problems due to miscommunication or mismatched value systems.Based on the author's years of experience as an entrepreneur, attorney, and international consultant specializing in alliance strategies, Intelligent Business Alliances covers every important type of alliance, including partnerships, joint ventures, distribution deals, and equity investments. It offers practical advice on every stage of the alliance process, from exploratory talks through negotiating the deal and day-to-day management of the alliance.",

For people all over the world, Anne Frank, the vivacious, intelligent Jewish girl with a crooked smile and huge dark eyes, has become the \"human face of the Holocaust.\" Her diary of twenty-five months in hiding, a precious record of her struggle to keep hope alive through the darkest days of this century, has touched the hearts of millions. Here, after five decades, is the first biography of this remarkable figure. Drawing on exclusive interviews with family and friends, on previously unavailable correspondence, and on documents long kept secret, Melissa Muller creates a nuanced portrait of her famous subject. This is the flesh-and-blood Anne Frank, unsentimentalized and so all the more affecting--Anne Frank restored to history. Muller traces Frank's life from an idyllic childhood in an assimilated family well established in Frankfurt banking circles to her passionate adolescence in German-occupied Amsterdam and her desperate  in Bergen Belsen at the age of sixteen. Full of revelations, this richly textured biography casts new light on Anne's relations with her mother, whom she treats harshly in the diary, and solves an enduring mystery: who betrayed the families hiding in the annex just when liberation was at hand? This is an indispensable volume for all those who seek a deeper, richer understanding of Anne Frank and the brutal times in which she lived and died.",

Why is humility a cherished value? Why do a gentle people shun disobedient members? How do the Amish regulate social change? Why is ownership of cars objectionable, but not their use? Why are some modes of transportation acceptable and other forbidden? Why are tractors permitted around barns but not in fields? Why are horses used to pull modern farm machinery? Why are telephones banned from Amish homes? Why are some forms of electricity acceptable while others are rejected? How is modern machinery operated without electricity? Why are some occupations acceptable and others taboo? Why do the Amish use the services of professionals -- lawyers, doctors, and dentists -- but oppose higher education? Why do Amish youth rebel in their teenage years? Are the Amish freeloading on American life? Are the Amish behind or ahead of the modern world?",

Thrill to the story of this determined NASCAR champion as he battles it out on the rough dirt tracks of North Carolina, achieves dominance throughout the 1980s and 90s, and keeps on winning until that last, fatal day.",

Only thing is, you'd be wrong. . . .For Oscar, life is good in New York City in the year 1900. He's the Mayor of Central Park -- the greatest place on earth for the squirrels, chipmunks, mice, and other animals who live there. He's the manager of his baseball team, the Central Park Green Sox, and shortstop, too. What could be bad? Plenty, that's what! Big Daddy Duds, jewel thief, all-round thug, and leader of rats, is about to invade the park with five hundred of his closest friends. And when he does, the other animals who live there will be turned out of their homes. Everyone looks to the Mayor to save them, but he may not even be able tosave himself from the invaders. \u00a0The Mayor of Central Park is a rich and fragrant evocation of old New York, with a community of animals who are as lively as characters in a Damon Runyon story, brought to life in a blend of humor and heartbreak that is vintage Avi.",

        "Description": "The emergence of the gay and lesbian community in the last quarter century has confronted America with what has become the new civil rights movement of the nineties, as millions of gay people assert their right to live as decent American citizens without the fear of persecution and discrimination.Since 1967 - two years before the Stonewall Riots, usually seen as the beginning of gay liberation - The Advocate has been the nations publication of record for the gay community. From its humble beginnings as a newsletter covering Southern California's homosexual subculture to its prominence today as a newsmagazine read around the world, The Advocate has mirrored the astonishing growth of the community it's served.Now the remarkable history of the modern gay and lesbian movement - a quarter century of rebellion and reform, tragedy and triumph - fills the hundreds of pages of news, photographs, essays, cartoons, and interviews culled from The Advocate. From first-person accounts of the Stonewall Riots to the tragic last day of Harvey Milk's life, from the crisis of AIDS to the controversy over outing, the milestones of the movement are presented as they happened, along with accounts of the lighter side of gay life, from disco divas to the politics of drag.Each year is introduced by a distinguished gay or lesbian historian or movement leader. Martin Duberman, Lillian Faderman, Allan Berube, Felice Picano, Urvashi Vaid, Joan Nestle, John Preston, Torie Osborn, and Randy Shilts are among those interpreting this revolutionary movement that has affected millions of people across the world.",

It both touches and calls forth what is most essential about common human experience. But until now, the images we have seen from it have traditionally been glitzy, posed, star shots. This book presents a different kind of vision, a vision, that, through photography, puts us in touch with all the emotions chronicled in the music. Here are revealing photos of Roy Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Chet Atkins, Kitty Wells, June Carter Cash, Loretta Lynn, Ronnie Milsap, Charlie Daniels, Waylon Jennings, Emmylou Harris, Tanya Tucker, Rosanne Cash, Billy Ray Cyrus, Brooks & Dunn, Vince Gill, Lorrie Morgan, Trisha Yearwood, Kathy Mattea - and scores more of the artists who define country past, present, and future.Maria von Matthiessen is a photographer of unique vision, style, and technique. Her portraits of these artists cut beneath showmanship and \"image\" to capture what is essential. Startling, charming, beautiful, often whimsical, and always revealing - together the photos present an intimate look at the world of country musicians and reveal its rarely glimpsed core.",

This tiny, rural town is home to Manda and Jake Frank, who overnight have become international celebrities as the parents of eleven tiny infants, born through fertility treatments. Their pastor and spokesperson, the Reverend Leland Vaughn, tries to shield them from the media frenzy, but even his head is turned when presidential hopeful Adams Brooke pays the family a visit.But there is one woman in town for whom Brooke's visit means so much more. Artisanal cheesemaker Margaret Prickett is struggling to save her centuries-old family farm. Suffering through a messy divorce and trying to raise her rebellious thirteen-year-old daughter, Polly, Margaret pins her farm's salvation on the sweeping amnesty Brooke promises America's independent farmers. With the help of her farmhand (and Thomas Jefferson impersonator) August Vaughn, Margaret works single-mindedly to get Brooke elected. In his honor, the two decide to re-create the Mammoth Cheese, a 1,235 pound wheel of Cheshire made by Thomas Jefferson's supporters and transported to Washington in 1801. As winter progresses, and the town's excitement over the \"Frank Eleven\" begins to wither, Three Chimneys turns its attention to Margaret's hopeful gift. But as the cheese makes its way to the nation's capital, and Polly slips deeper into a dangerous relationship with her radical history teacher, Margaret soon finds that trying to preserve what she has may very well cost her all she holds dear.",

        "Description": "Why do some people lead positive, hope-filled lives, while others wallow in pessimism? In her groundbreaking book, Half Empty, Half Full, leading psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and researcher Susan C. Vaughan reveals the specific character traits that produce highly hopeful individuals and offers fresh and helpful advice on how to become a more optimistic person. Examining the origins of optimism in early childhood and presenting new evidence for the role of biology in how we interpret our experiences, Vaughan shows how optimism is a process, not a state, that is within the grasp of everyone. Informative and uplifting, Half Empty, Half Full offers some unusual but proven tricks and techniques to fool the brain's circuitry into looking on the bright side of life.",

We are in his chambers as he does battle with lawyers more interested in their personal ambitions than justice. We are at a judicial conference where Rothwax stumps fifty appeals court judges, who admit they don't understand the Supreme Court's latest search-and-seizure rulings. We are in the courtroom, where Rothwax must sit patiently and allow lawyers to willfully obfuscate the truth.According to Rothwax, America is fast becoming a nation of bad laws, in which criminals and defense attorneys hide behind a morass of poorly conceived statutes, procedures, and rulings that prevent courts from resolving the paramount question at hand: Did the accused commit the crime? In trial after maddening trial, Rothwax sees the truth sacrificed at the altar of an increasingly areane process designed to protect the rights of criminals.",

Anthony Lukas, a masterful storyteller, tells a mesmerizing tale -- of a terrible murder, a great trial, and the struggle they set off for the soul of America.Big Trouble begins on a snowy evening at Christmas time 1905 in the little town of Caldwell, Idaho, to which the state's former governor, Frank Steunenberg, had returned to head his family bank while contemplating his political future. As he walked home that night, he sensed all about him the bold, exuberant, unashamedly acquisitive spirit of Caldwell's young entrepreneurs, who -- as his brother had written -- were \"here for the money.\" Like so many in the West at that time, these brothers believed their prospects for enriching themselves were limitless, that the future opened wide before them.ANd yet the governor suffered premonitions that he and his neighbors weren't fully in control of their own destiny, that something malign threatened their well-being.Now, as he followed the plume of his frozen breath, his boots crunching eight inches of freshly frozen snow, he turned through his garden gate and a bomb attached to the gatepost blew him \"into eternity.\"",

One of the architects of modern baseball, he built the farm club system of producing major league players and pioneered the application of technology (e.g., the batting machine) in instruction. Rickey's finest moment came in 1947 when he brought up Jackie Robinson to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers, thereby breaking the color barrier in major league baseball.In Branch Rickey's Little Blue Book, Rickey (primarily in his own words and in the words of those who knew him) shares his secrets for success both on and off the diamond. Culled from Rickey's writings, letters, scouting reports, and lectures, this collection reveals Rickey's peerless understanding of the game, his motivational techniques, and his respect for the rules and people that drive our national pastime.",

        "Description": "Here\u2019s some of what just happened: Millions of ordinary, sensible people came into possession of computers. These machines had wondrous powers, yet made unexpected demands on their owners. Telephones broke free of the chains that had shackled them to bedside tables and office desks. No one was out of touch, or wanted to be out of touch. Instant communication became a birthright.A new world, located no one knew exactly where, came into being, called \u201cvirtual\u201d or \u201conline,\u201d named \u201ccyberspace\u201d or \u201cthe Internet\u201d or just \u201cthe network.\u201d Manners and markets took on new shapes and guises.As all this was happening, James Gleick, author of the groundbreaking Chaos, columnist for The New York Times Magazine, and\u2014very briefly\u2014an Internet entrepreneur, emerged as one of our most astute guides to this new world. His dispatches\u2014by turns passionate, bewildered, angry, and amazed\u2014form an extraordinary chronicle. Gleick loves what the network makes possible, and he hates it. Software makers developed a strangely tolerant view of an ancient devil, the product defect. One company, at first a feisty upstart, seized control of the hidden gears and levers of the new economy. We wrestled with novel issues of privacy, anonymity, and disguise. We found that if the human species is evolving a sort of global brain, it\u2019s susceptible to new forms of hysteria and multiple-personality disorder.What Just Happened is at once a remarkable portrait of a world in the throes of transformation and a prescient guide to the transformation still to come.",
