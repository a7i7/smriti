        "Description": "Following the amazing success of his New York Times bestseller 8 Minutes in the Morning, America's #1 online weight loss specialist Jorge Cruise is back with a revolutionary diet book that keeps with his trademark hassle\u2013free, time\u2013friendly approach.  It's a fact: the low\u2013carb craze is everywhere. Although low\u2013carb diets produce short term weight loss, the results are not sustainable. Dieticians, fitness experts, and medical publications are slowly awakening to the fact that the low\u2013carb diet isn't the answer to weight loss nor a solution to the obesity epidemic. Jorge Cruise's The 3\u2013Hour Diet reveals that timing is the revolutionary weight loss element that has been kept secret until now. By eating small, balanced meals every three hours you reset your body's metabolism and achieve amazing results. Eating every three hours turns off your \"starvation protection mechanism\" ensuring that fat is released and fat\u2013burning muscle preserved. So get ready to lose 2 pounds each week! All with no calorie counting, no starvation, and no deprivation. Bottom line, timing will sculpt your body slim. With his now trademark easy\u2013to\u2013follow instructions, accessibility, and client success stories, Jorge Cruise's The 3\u2013Hour Diet is a fluid combination of proven success and categorical innovation. Weight loss has never been easier!  o  For overweight people disillusioned with the low\u2013carb craze and other fad diets that don't work or are even unhealthy. Also aimed at people with busy schedules looking to lose weight quickly and effectively, utilizing a dietary approach instead of committing to a workout regimen.  o  8 Minutes in the Morning has sold 1.8K through BookScan.  o  The dark side of low\u2013carb diets is only just beginning to rear its ugly head, and this book has the potential to be at the forefront of the low\u2013carb backlash. In this book readers will find: o  Why low\u2013carb and other fad diets make you fat, and why timing is the key to sustained weight loss. o  The Cruise Down Plate approach to eating that supports lean muscle development by eating your favourite foods (including candy and carbs) with no banned items and no calorie\u2013counting. Includes frozen foods and fast food options! o  How to prevent emotional eating. o  A 28\u2013Day Planner designed to promote organization and accountability for the dieter. o  An all\u2013new meal and recipe guide, that is both delicious and healthy.",

But the endless nights of meaningless sex and secret rendezvous with married women have begun to weigh on his conscience. Malcolm is suffering from job burnout. He soon discovers, however, that a life-style change won't come so easily, not with the allure of so many beautiful women and thousands of tax-free dollars.",

The span of his attention in these twenty-three essays is enthralling: from \"Who Am I?,\" in which he recounts the first adventures of childhood reading, to \"Borges in Love,\" a memoir of the great blind writer's passions; from his first encounters with the evils of prejudice to a meditation on the death of Che Guevara; from a tour of his library to evocations of such of his favorite writers as Cort\u00e1zar and Chesterton.  A voyage deep into the subversive heart of words, Into the Looking-Glass Wood is fired by the author's humanity, insatiable curiosity, and steadfast belief in the essential power, mystery, and delight of the written word.",

        "Authors": "By Flanagan, David",
        "Description": "JavaScript is a simple programming language from Netscape that can be embedded in your HTML web pages.  It allows you to control the behavior of the web browser, add dynamically created text to your web pages, interact with the user through HTML forms (without CGI scripts), and, in version 3.0 of Netscape Navigator, even control and interact with Java applets and Navigator plugins.    JavaScript is not an alternative to Java, but an ideal partner.  The two languages have separate but very complementary features.  Since JavaScript is a simple language that can be embedded directly into a web page, without need for compilation, it is accessible to more web page authors, and may actually have a larger short-term impact on the Web and on Internet computing than Java itself.   This book is a definitive guide for JavaScript.  The first eight chapters document the core JavaScript language, and the next six describe how JavaScript works on the client side to interact with the web browser and with the web page.  These chapters are followed by acomplete reference section that documents every object, property, method, event handler, function, and constructor used by client-side JavaScript.  This book also covers the use of JavaScript on web servers, as well as the object, properties, and methods of server-side JavaScript.  A separate reference section documents the interaction between JavaScript and HTML -- mainly aspects of HTML that relate to JavaScript.The book describes the version of JavaScript shipped with Navigator 2.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2, and also the much-changed version of JavaScript shipped with Navigator 3.0, 3.0.1, and 3.0.2.  It also covers LiveConnect,  used for communication between JavaScript and Java applets, and commonly encountered bugs on JavaScript objects.",

Seeing adolescence as an extended \"rite of passage,\" the author presents stages and tasks that need to be accomplished on the way to adulthood.Part II describes the Developmental Tasks in several areas: personal identity, sexuality, family relationships, social relations with peers, and educational and vocational choice. Therapeutic strategies are suggested for use when the adolescent has taken a developmental detour or is in danger of becoming derailed altogether.Part III focuses on Developmental Traps: drug and alcohol use, suicide, aggression and violence, eating disorders, depression, and chronic diseases. Here proposals for treatment and for changes in social attitudes and policy are specific and strongly worded; they are based on research and on the author's many years of clinical experience.",

We're talking real political power.These days lots of stars try to use their status to mess with public policy. Never mind that Hollywood celebs often have no more training or expertise in the stuff they're promoting than the average John or Jane Q. What they do have is press coverage. That makes them influential. And they have star power. That makes them big draws for politicos who need to raise big bucks.In Tales from the Left Coast, author and political commentator James Hirsen aims his satirical squirt gun at Hollywood to expose celebrity \"pundits\" for what they really are: media circus hounds who can't tell populism from Bolshevism.",

But in this groundbreaking book based on the world-renowned SMARTWired program, Dr. Markova demonstrates a more effective strategy that centers on building a child\u2019s strengths. This approach not only helps children discover their passion and purpose in life, but it also instills in them a strong sense of self-worth\u2013which in turn makes them highly motivated to learn.A longtime teacher, Dr. Markova understands that by recognizing and developing children\u2019s unique assets, parents can help them succeed not just in school but in life. She cites compelling anecdotes across all age groups and reveals practical strategies: the essential principles of the SMARTWired approach to learning, the three kinds of attention the human brain uses, and the five categories of children\u2019s assets. Along the way, you will discover how to\u2022 identify and support your child\u2019s hidden talents\u2022 help your child make sound decisions with confidence\u2022 communicate on the same wavelength with your child for better mutual understanding\u2022 nurture your child\u2019s assets in partnerships with schools, mentors, coaches, and other resources\u2022 free your child from societal expectationsAn impassioned call to arms backed by a point-by-point plan, The SMART Parenting Revolution provides the road map for all parents looking to develop their children\u2019s full potential.",

But their last day of high school becomes their final day together after one of them brings a gun to school to resolve a mysterious feud. When the police arrive, they discover two wounded girls, one so critically that she is not expected to recover. The third girl is dead, killed instantly by a shot to the heart.What transpired that morning at Glendale High rocks the foundation of an affluent community in Baltimore's distant suburbs, a place that has barely recovered from an earlier, more comprehensible tragedy. For the shell-shocked parents, teachers, administrators, and students, healing must begin with answers to the usual questions - but only if the answers are safe ones, answers that will lead back to one girl and one family and absolve everyone else.For Homicide Sgt. Harold Lenhardt, this case is a mystery with more twists than these grief-stricken suburbanites are willing to acknowledge - and the sole lucid survivor, a girl with a teenager's uncanny knack for stonewalling, strikes him as being less than honest. What is she concealing? Is she trying to protect herself or someone else? Even the simplest secrets can kill - and kill again if no one is willing to confront them.",

        "Authors": "By Lisick, Beth",
        "Description": "Beth Lisick started out as a homecoming princess with a Crisco-aided tan and a bad perm. And then everything changed. How exactly did this suburban girl next door end up as one of San Francisco's foremost chroniclers of alternative culture, touring as the only straight woman with a band of punk rock lesbian poets and living in illegal warehouses -- all while managing to get married, buy a house, and have a baby? Lisick explains it all in her hilarious, irreverent memoir Everybody into the Pool.Plunging headlong into America's deepest subcultures, while keeping both feet firmly planted in her parents' Leave It to Beaver values, Lisick makes her adult home on the fringe of mainstream culture and finds it rich with paradox and humor. On one hand, she lives in \"Brokeley\" with drug dealers and street gangs; on the other, she drives a station wagon with a car seat in the back, makes her own chicken stock, and attends ladies' luncheons.Among Lisick's true tales are \"My Way or the Bi-Way,\" in which a series of girl-on-girl fiascos from UC Santa Cruz confirm her suspicions that she's just a straight girl with a positive attitude who'd give anything the old college try; \"The Lowly Hustle,\" in which she takes on a litany of odd jobs to make ends meet (\"I was like a college student designing my own major, except I was thirty-five and designing my own minimum-wage job\"); and the endearing story of her \"courtship\" with her now husband Eli, who impresses her with a spastic rendition of a song called \"The Wack-Ass Caucasian Two Step Chicken\" and invites her to his Mission District warehouse space -- a world of feral raccoons and exploding sewage pipes. (It's clear to Lisick that he's \"The One.\")Fans of David Sedaris and Sarah Vowell will relish Lisick's scathingly funny, smart, and very real take on the effluvia of daily living. No matter what community she's exposing to the light, Lisick's hilarious perspective always hits the right chord.",

        "Title": "Tragic Muse: Rachel of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise",
        "Authors": "By Brownstein, Rachel M.",
        "Description": "The great nineteenth-century tragedienne known simply as Rachel was the first dramatic actress to achieve international fame. Composing her own persona with the same brilliance and passion she demonstrated on stage, she virtually invented the role of \"star.\" Rumors of her extravagant life offstage delighted the audiences who flocked to theaters in Boston and Paris, London and Moscow, to see her perform in the tragedies of Racine and Corneille. In Tragic Muse, Rachel M. Brownstein reveals the life of la grande Rachel and explores\u2014at the boundary of biography, fiction, and cultural history\u2014the connections between this self-dramatizing woman and her image.Born to itinerant Jewish peddlers in 1821, Rachel arrived on the Paris stage at the age of fifteen. She became both a symbol of her culture\u2019s highest art and a clue to its values and obsessions. Fascinated with all things Napoleonic, she was the mother of Napoleon\u2019s grandson and the lover of many men connected to the emperor. Her story\u2014the rise from humble beginnings to queen of the French state theater\u2014echoes and parodies Napoleon\u2019s own. She decisively controlled her career, her time, and finances despite the actions and claims of managers, suitors, and lovers. A woman of exceptional charisma, Rachel embodied contradiction and paradox. She captured the attention of her time and was memorialized in the works of Matthew Arnold, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, George Eliot, and Henry James.Richly illustrated with portraits, photographs, and caricatures, Tragic Muse combines brilliant literary analysis and exceptional historical research. With great skill and acuity, Rachel M. Brownstein presents Rachel\u2014her brief intense life and the image that was both self-fashioned and, outliving her, fashioned by others. First published by Knopf (1993), this  book will attract a broad audience interested in matters as wide ranging as the construction of character, the cult of celebrity, women\u2019s lives, and Jewish history. It will also be of enduring interest to readers concerned with nineteenth-century French culture, history, literature, theater, and Romanticism. Tragic Muse won the 1993 George Freedley Award presented by the Theater Library Association.",

Drawing on landmark studies conducted by distinguished researchers, this book presents a solid foundation of evidence that negative emotions such as worry, anxiety, depression, hostility, and anger can increase susceptibility to disease - and that positive emotions such as optimism, humor, and a fighting spirit can protect health and increase longevity.Unique features: presents scientific data with clarity and simplicity that shows the undeniable connection between the mind and body; demonstrates the body's physical responses to perception of ourselves and our circumstances; covers how social support, friendship, and strong, stable relationships protect our health; discusses how different personalities are either prone to, or able to resist, disease; and explains the scientifically proven changes in heart rate, hormones, and body chemistry that accompany various attitudes and emotions.An important work for anyone involved in health or behavioral sciences, this book explores findings in the dramatic new field of psychoneuroimmunology, and demonstrates through the most recent technical advances how attitudes and emotions affect immunity.",

        "Description": "Here are the simple truths that motivate people of any age to find and accept lasting happiness, illustrated with the stories of real people, and illuminated with the observations of spiritual leaders and great philosophers.  For more than three decades, attorney, financial consultant, and life coach Stephen M. Pollan has been advising clients and readers on the business of living\u2014everything from home buying and employment contracts to marriage and parenting. He has taught his clients and readers to Die Broke (use assets rather than build up an estate), to stage Second Acts (reinvent their lives), and, most recently, to Fire Your Boss (take charge of their own work lives).Throughout these books, Pollan stresses that attitudes as well as actions are essential to success. Indeed, over the years he realized that the happiest and most successful people he'd met were also those who were the most energetic and exuberant, regardless of their age. By noting these attributes and incorporating them in his own life, Pollan came to understand that our attitudes are not just one element of succeeding at the business of living, they are in fact the foundation of leading a happy life. Attitude is everything.Those attitudes most essential to our deepest satisfaction and happiness reflect what our spiritual leaders and philosophers from every major tradition have taught us. We don't have to look to external forces to validate us and give us self-worth. We already have within us all we need to find fulfillment and lead happy, satisfying lives\u2014lives without regrets. To finally be happy we need to accept responsibility for our own happiness. When we know the secrets are already inside us, all we have to do is start living them. With this book, we can begin now.",

Estimated to extend for more than three hundred miles, only ninety of them mapped, the cave was formed by acid burning away the limestone; corridors, pits, cramped wormholes, cliffs, and splendid rooms the size of football fields tangle together in a maze shrouded in the utter darkness of the underground. When a fellow ranger is injured in a caving accident, Anna swallows her paralyzing fear of small spaces and descends into Lechuguilla to help a friend in need.Worse than the claustrophobia that haunts her are the signs - some natural and some, more ominously, manmade - that not everyone is destined to emerge from this wondrous living tomb. The terrain is alien and hostile; the greed and destructive powers of mankind all too familiar. In this place of internal terrors, Anna must learn who it is she can trust and, in the end, decide who is to live and who is to die.",

Over the course of his meteoric career, this charismatic, outspoken, and at times controversial coach provided the inspiration that helped turn failing programs into winning ones at Boston and Providence, and that worked its magic with the New York Knicks. Now, Pitino has helped bring Kentucky back after two years of ignominy under NCAA sanctions - and this is the book that tells how he did it.Full-Court Pressure offers a rare, eye-opening chance to see Pitino up-close, personal, and in action. We see him putting the 'Cats through their paces, and putting his own experiences in college and pro basketball in frank and fascinating perspective. For the first time, he discusses his real reasons for leaving the Knicks. He talks about the adjustment of moving from New York City to Lexington, Kentucky, and how he managed to motivate a team that was in the doldrums after being prohibited from the playoffs and appearing on televised games for two years. He shows us the 1991-92 season, game by game, exhilarating win by heartbreaking loss, including losing to LSU, and beating Indiana at the Hoosier Dome. He candidly discusses other coaches, from Bobby Knight to Dale Brown to Pat Riley to Wimp Sanderson, and players from Michael Jordan to Patrick Ewing to Shaquille O'Neal. And he devotes an entire chapter to the game that's already being called \"one of the best college basketball games in history,\" the game in which, until the last two seconds, it looked as if Kentucky would beat Duke and Christian Laettner and make it to the Final Four.All eyes are on Rick Pitino and the Kentucky Wildcats this fall - and Full-Court Pressure is the perfect book for basketball fans who are anticipating the new season with Pitino and his `Cats.",

When the older brother of one of the students is murdered in Mississippi during Freedom Summer, they think they have found their mission, and when they receive letters from him seemingly written after his death, a heady mystical dimension is added that impels them into the civil rights and peace movements, joining their lives to a multitude of others.Among the huge cast of characters: A boy-genius comic-book artist, who transforms their gang into Superheroes. The lovely long-legged sister of the boy who was murdered and the brilliant kid brother of the black activist killed with him. The gay son of a wealthy art collector, who introduces his friends to the wild and sometimes dangerous New York art scene. The beautiful daughter of a Holocaust survivor, who joins the ultraradical Weathermen; the quantum physics whiz and Christian mystic who becomes her bomb-maker; and a Black Power leader, who will accompany her and others into their last and most extreme act.",

        "Description": "Cliff Janeway is back! The Bookman's Promise marks the eagerly awaited return of Denver bookman-author John Dunning and the award-winning crime novel series that helped to turn the nation on to first-edition book collecting.First, it was Booked to Die, then The Bookman's Wake. Now John Dunning fans, old and new, will rejoice in The Bookman's Promise, a richly nuanced new Janeway novel that juxtaposes past and present as Denver ex-cop and bookman Cliff Janeway searches for a book and a killer.The quest begins when an old woman, Josephine Gallant, learns that Janeway has recently bought at auction a signed first edition by the legendary nineteenth-century explorer Richard Francis Burton. The book is a true classic, telling of Burton's journey (disguised as a Muslim) to the forbidden holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The Boston auction house was a distinguished and trustworthy firm, but provenance is sometimes murky and Josephine says the book is rightfully hers.She believes that her grandfather, who was living in Baltimore more than eighty years ago, had a fabulous collection of Burton material, including a handwritten journal allegedly detailing Burton's undercover trip deep into the troubled American South in 1860. Josephine remembers the books from her childhood, but everything mysteriously disappeared shortly after her grandfather's death. With little time left in her own life, Josephine begs for Janeway's promise: he must find her grandfather's collection. It's a virtually impossible task, Janeway suspects, as the books will no doubt have been sold and separated over the years, but how can he say no to a dying woman?It seems that her grandfather, Charlie Warren, traveled south with Burton in the spring of 1860, just before the Civil War began. Was Burton a spy for Britain? What happened during the three months in Burton's travels for which there are no records? How did Charlie acquire his unique collection of Burton books? What will the journal, if it exists, reveal?When a friend is murdered, possibly because of a Burton book, Janeway knows he must find the answers. Someone today is willing to kill to keep the secrets of the past, and Janeway's search will lead him east: To Baltimore, to a Pulitzer Prize-winning author with a very stuffed shirt, and to a pair of unorthodox booksellers.  It reaches a fiery conclusion at Fort Sumter off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. What's more, a young lawyer, Erin d'Angelo, and ex-librarian Koko Bujak, have their own reasons for wanting to find the journal. But can Janeway trust them?Rich with the insider's information on rare and collectible books that has made John Dunning famous, and with meticulously researched detail about a mesmerizing figure who may have played an unrecognized role in our Civil War, The Bookman's Promise is riveting entertainment from an extraordinarily gifted author who is as unique and special as the books he so clearly loves.",

        "Description": "From the executive director of the ACLU, Anthony D. Romero, and award-winning journalist Dina Temple-Raston, In Defense of Our America takes a critical look at civil liberties in this country at a time when constitutional freedoms are in peril. Using the stories of real Americans on the frontlines of the fight for civil liberties., In Defense of Our America provides a look at the dangerous erosion of the Bill of Rights in the age of terror.   Against the backdrop of post-9/11 America, readers are taken behind the scenes of some of the most important civil liberties cases in America. From the story of the \"American Taliban\" to the battle against the National Security Agency's warrantless spying program, In Defense of Our America tracks a roster of skirmishes in the larger fight for civil liberties in this country. It tracks an effort in Pennsylvania to force religion into the public school science curriculum and tells the story of South Dakota's attempts to place an outright ban on abortions in the state.   In a narrative that allows the characters to tell the story, In Defense of Our America offers the first inside look at the Lindh family as they saw their son and brother, John Walker Lindh, emerge as a symbol of America's battle against Islamic fundamentalism. It follows Joshua Dratel, a defense attorney at the center of many legal battles over the rights of individuals suspected of terrorism, and tells the story of a modern-day Scopes trial in Dover, Pennsylvania. The book tracks the case of Matthew Limon, a gay teenager sentenced to 17 years for having consensual oral sex with a younger teenage boy in Kansas, and looks behind the reports of a broken judicial system in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.   In Defense of Our America chronicles the stories of an array of colorful characters to illustrate the state of play in today's fight for civil liberties, including Cecelia Fire Thunder, the Sioux president who wanted to open an abortion clinic on her South Dakota reservation, and high school science teacher Bertha Spahr who defied a school board dominated by fundamentalist Christians by taking a stand against \"intelligent design.\"   With unparalleled access to key players in some of the landmark tests of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, In Defense of Our America weaves together a compelling narrative that provides an unusually full look at the fight for civil liberties as Americans struggle to protect their rights and ensure their security.",

You might want to think about that the next time you read something like, \"A dazzling page-turner, this novel shows an internationally acclaimed storyteller at the height of his astonishing powers.\"Adverbs is a novel about love -- a bunch of different people, in and out of different kinds of love. At the start of the novel, Andrea is in love with David -- or maybe it's Joe -- who instead falls in love with Peter in a taxi. At the end of the novel, it's Joe who's in the taxi, falling in love with Andrea, although it might not be Andrea, or in any case it might not be the same Andrea, as Andrea is a very common name. So is Allison, who is married to Adrian in the middle of the novel, although in the middle of the ocean she considers a fling with Keith and also with Steve, whom she meets in an automobile, unless it's not the same Allison who meets the Snow Queen in a casino, or the same Steve who meets Eddie in the middle of the forest. . . . It might sound confusing, but that's love, and as the author -- me -- says, \"It is not the nouns. The miracle is the adverbs, the way things are done.\" This novel is about people trying to find love in the ways it is done before the volcano erupts and the miracle ends. Yes, there's a volcano in the novel. In my opinion a volcano automatically makes a story more interesting.",

This irresistible collection of notable errors from the pages of The New York Times includes everything from gross historical inaccuracies, glaring misidentifications, and disastrous recipes to a wide range of inexplicable, unsupportable boners.  Kill Duck Before Serving is a quirky selection of all the corrections fit to print by one of our most esteemed newspapers.March 11, 1975In yesterday's issue, The New York Times did not report on riots in Milan and the subsequent murder of the lay religious reformer Erlembald. These events took place in 1075, the year given in the dateline under the nameplate on Page 1. The Times regrets both incidents.April 7, 1995Because of a transcription error, an article about Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's remarks about Judge Lance A. Ito misquoted the Senator at one point. In his conversation with the radio host Don Imus, he said: \"I mean, this is a disgrace. Judge Ito will be well known.\" He did not say, \"Judge Ito with the wet nose.\"October 22, 2000An article about Ivana Trump and her spending habits misstated the number of bras she buys.

At home in a North London suburb, Ripple keeps close tabs on his neighbors while his own family splinters apart. As the years pass by he forges on, bravely and awkwardly, in his relationships with his wife and children, his parents, girlfriends, colleagues, and friends, and in his ongoing search for certainties, both moral and practical.But what he gains in wisdom over time, he loses in love, as his marriage disintegrates and his children grow further away from him. The more he lives and the more he learns, the less he understands.Through the vividness of his voice and his growing sense of the sorrow and absurdity of the world, Tom Ripple becomes an unusually appealing anti-hero, aware of his ordinariness and the limits of his intelligence, with a ribald sense of humor, and a clumsiness in his attempts at emotional connection with others. He is a bewildered everyman navigating his way through modern times.In this remarkable debut novel, Charles Chadwick has created one of the most memorable, brilliantly realized characters in contemporary fiction. By turns poignant, funny, heartbreaking, and profound, It's All Right Now is a towering achievement and a singular work of the imagination.",

Building on his extensive experience, many previously unavailable documents, and unparalleled access to the leadership circles of the two Korean states and the great powers, he has written a gripping narrative history of Korea\u2019s travails and triumphs over the past quarter century. The involvement of the outside world?including a chilling account of the nuclear showdown that brought the United States perilously close to war with North Korea in 1994?receives extensive treatment and special emphasis.Korea represents the last vestige of the Cold War. The Two Koreas places that political tension within a historical context, looking at democratic South Korea and communist North Korea through the lens of the past twenty-five years. Oberdorfer\u2019s work is the definitive text of contemporary Korea.",
