        "Description": "Splitting swoops with dizzying ease among the conflicting perspectives of a woman whose personality, in the face of her impending divorce, has slivered into a chorus of bickering interior voices, each with its own very distinct tastes and agendas. Ranging from former teen pop star to hapless titled wife, Angelica runs riot over London and its environs, chauffeured by the roguishly handsome Ram - who manages to sleep with all of her selves, sometimes simultaneously.A sharp and funny portrait of divorce, Splitting captures brilliantly the chaotic rhythms of a woman in crisis as it chronicles Angelica's disintegration into a handful of \"perforated\" personalities. No one writes with shrewder insight about women and that ambiguous and overriding presence in their lives, men, than Fay Weldon. This is a journey rich with her wit, wisdom, and very original narrative power.",

Irina is desperate to escape Krupatin, to regain a portion of her shattered self, but before she can she must carry out one last, deadly mission for him. But this time, Irina's odds of surviving seem impossible.FBI special agent Cate Cuevas, still in mourning, has just learned of a devastating betrayal by her slain husband. Wounded and shaken, she is suddenly plunged into the most challenging and dangerous assignment of her career. The leaders of three great international crime organizations, the Hong Kong Chinese, the Sicilian La Cosa Nostra, and the Russian Mafia, are to meet in Houston. The implications are stunning, and horrendous. But the FBI has a chance to stop this unholy alliance, if Cate Cuevas can infiltrate the Russian contingent - and if she can get out alive.When Cate and Irina meet, each playing their shadow roles, they are drawn to each other strangely and powerfully. And as Cate and Irina fight to survive amid the intricate and deadly stratagems of men of violence and cunning - Sergei Krupatin, the courtly young Siciliano Carlo Bontate, the mysteriously exotic Chinese Wei Tsing, and Cate's win-at-all-costs FBI handlers - their relationship becomes an ever-more-intimate dance of sexual attraction and murderous intent.",

Now, after the success of Paper Doll, applauded by The Boston Globe as \"one of the best Spensers in a decade,\" Parker returns with his two-fisted sleuth in Walking Shadow - a twisty, ambitious whodunit, which finds them both breaking new ground.A Massachusetts waterfront town. A small repertory theater with a big reputation. A soupcon of scandal. And Spenser is on hand to steal the scene.Hired by the Port City Theater Company's board of trustees to investigate the director's claim that he is being followed, Spenser feels like a fish out of water - until an actor is gunned down during a performance of a politically controversial play. Then Boston's premier private cop and his cohort, Hawk, go into action, plunging straight into a maze of motives that constitutes a master class in the difficulty of judging reality from appearances. Spenser soon discovers that solving the actor's murder is only a piece of the puzzle. From covert carnal connections within the community to municipal corruption with international tentacles; from petty troublemakers to major malefactors for whom murder is merely a day at the office - this case has everything it takes to stump the sharpest of Sherlocks. And nobody loves a challenge more than Spenser.Heady and sardonic, with an unpredictable cast of lovers, liars, killers, and clowns, Walking Shadow entertains even as it ponders the instability of identities. It is a thoroughly engrossing performance by a classic talent.",

To the FBI, the circumstances surrounding the scientists' deaths spell the work of an unusually skilled serial poisoner, and they have zeroed in on a single suspect: the brilliant, beautiful Dr. Christine Palmer. A world-renowned toxicologist and leader of numerous international research teams, Palmer is one of only a handful of scientists with highly classified knowledge of the deadliest experimental neurotoxins and their antidotes.  When a molecular toxicologist is poisoned while working at a top-secret research facility outside Santa Fe, Dr. Sylvia Strange and counterterrorism expert Edmond Sweetheart are recruited to assemble a psychological profile of Palmer in an effort to link her to the crimes. But as Sylvia's investigation of Palmer's charismatic persona draws her ever more strongly into the scientist's orbit, hunter and hunted become perilously intertwined. And when Sylvia discovers that her partner may be withholding crucial information, she no longer knows who can be trusted: is the killer friend or foe?  Sylvia will risk everything she holds dear, only to learn that there is no safe haven from a voyeuristic killer whose weapon of choice may go undetected in the food you eat, the clothes you wear, or the air you breathe.",

And he'd been told how David Dubin (as his father had Americanized the name that Stewart later reclaimed) had rescued Stewart's mother from the horror of the Balingen concentration camp. But when he discovers, after his father's death, a packet of wartime letters to a former fianc\u00e9e, and learns of his father's court-martial and imprisonment, he is plunged into the mystery of his family's secret history and driven to uncover the truth about this enigmatic, distant man who'd always refused to talk about his war.As he pieces together his father's past through military archives, letters, and, finally, notes from a memoir his father wrote while in prison, secretly preserved by the officer who defended him, Stewart starts to assemble a dramatic and baffling chain of events. He learns how  Dubin, a JAG lawyer attached to Patton's Third Army and desperate for combat experience, got more than he bargained for when he was ordered to arrest Robert Martin, a wayward OSS officer who, despite his spectacular bravery with the French Resistance, appeared to be acting on orders other than his commanders'. In pursuit of Martin, Dubin and his sergeant are parachuted into Bastogne just as the Battle of the Bulge reaches its apex. Pressed into the leadership of a desperately depleted rifle company, the men are forced to abandon their quest for Martin and his fiery, maddeningly elusive comrade, Gita, as they fight for their lives through carnage and chaos the likes of which Dubin could never have imagined.In reconstructing the terrible events and agonizing choices his father faced on the battlefield, in the courtroom, and in love, Stewart gains a closer understanding of his past, of his father's character, and of the brutal nature of war itself.",

He shows that despite reactionary fire-breathers and fanatics, religion has often been a progressive force in American politics, and explains why the policy of a separate church and state has, ironically, made the position of the church stronger.Marked by the extraordinary quality of observation that has defined Will\u2019s work, Under God is a rich, original look at why religion and politics will never be separate in the United States.",
