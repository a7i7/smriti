        "Description": "Never has Kathy Mallory had a case quite like the one she has now.Night had fallen, and the woman looked down at the crumpled letter, as if, in absolute darkness, she could read the postscript: Only a monster can play this game.In Chicago, an FBI agent is killed in a psychiatrist's waiting room. In New York, the jurors from a conventional trial are murdered one by one. The only connections between the two: a flamboyant shock-jock, whose on-air comments seem to be taking him dangerously close to the edge, and a woman, her body misshapen since childhood, whose job it is to clean up crime scenes - and maybe create them as well. This is a federal case, and Mallory's been told the FBI wants no part of her. But she knows something nobody else does - and besides, when has she ever cared what anybody else wanted?",

        "Description": "\"When I decided I wanted to be a vet,\" James Herriot wrote in his introduction to this volume - his very last completed piece of writing - \"I knew that I wanted to be a dog doctor, so I could spend all my time with dogs.\" As everyone knows, James Herriot became much more than a dog doctor. But no animal was dearer to his heart, and no animal provided him with more heartwarming and wonderful tales, than man's best friend.Now, for the first time, ten of James Herriot's most beloved stories about dogs are collected in one gorgeous illustrated edition: James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories. Here is Jock the sheepdog, rescued from neglect by a doting - and dotty - mistress; here is Brandy, a mutt who's only happy (and healthy) when he's digging in a dustbin; here are Border collies, dachshunds, even Tricki Woo, the memorable Pekingese. And, as always, in these pages the celebrated Yorkshire vet brings to life these animals' human counterparts, painting them with warmth and humor in equal measure. Brought to life by the vibrant watercolors of Lesley Holmes, this collection of tales is a welcome gift from one of the greatest storytellers of our time - James Herriot.",

A good citizen who has been summoned to what looks like a routine tour of civic duty. But the trial she is called to serve on is no ordinary trial. It is a mob trial, whose outcome has been meticulously orchestrated by a man of insidious power and deadly precision. A man who lives by the teachings of Lao Tsu ... whose magnetism is irresistible ... whose mind is as brilliant as it is twisted. He is known to some as the Teacher, and he's set his sights on Annie Laird.Pulled into the most chilling depths of the criminal underworld, Annie will be seduced by double-edged promises, stalked by the specter of terror, then, finally, driven to a shocking decision by the most basic motivation a woman can know.Graced with a rarely equaled mastery of style, peopled with a remarkable gallery of characters, and featuring one of the most compelling criminal minds in contemporary fiction, George Dawes Green's The Juror is a tour de force of crime and obsession, evil and innocence - a story that taps into fears so primal they linger long after the last page has been read.",

Privy now to the innermost thoughts and feelings of his family and friends-confessions that are raw, brutal, and unexpected-Nathan spends the day of his wake getting to know the living as he has never known them before: His father struggles with a legacy of family tragedy; his wife with the baggage of a doomed affair; his older daughter with her burgeoning sexuality and adolescent confusion. But why isn't Nathan's young daughter Lois at the wake? Who are the two strangers at the funeral, and why does their presence fill him with dread? Part detective story, part family portrait, Death of an Ordinary Man is an unflinching look at the margins of human experience, where the boundaries of fundamental feelings?love, grief, desire, shame, and hope?meet and mingle, and no motivation is as simple as it seems.",

        "Authors": "By Kramer, Peter D.",
        "Description": "Since it was introduced in 1987, Prozac has been prescribed to nearly five million Americans. But what is Prozac?\u00a0A medication or a mental steroid? A cure for depression, or a drug that changes personality? Reported to turn shy people into social butterflies and to improve work performance, memory, even dexterity, does Prozac work on character rather than illness? Are we using it cosmetically, to make people more attractive, more energetic, more socially acceptable? And what does it tell us about the nature of character and the mutability of self? With the addition of an afterword that gives us an up-to-date report on Prozac in America today, including his personal observations, reactions to his critics, and the latest scientific research, psychiatrist Peter Kramer reinforces what The New York Times calls 'an intelligent and informative book...which tells us new things about the chemistry of human character.'Dr. Kramer was recently asked to guest host The Infinite Mind, a weekly public radio show focusing on the art and science of the human mind and spirit, behavior, and mental health. Listen\u00a0to the show now.",

        "Authors": "By Parasuraman, A. and Colby, Charles L.",
        "Description": "Conventional techniques for marketing technology products fail primarily because marketers do not truly understand their customers. Do you know what customers really think about your technology? Now, drawing on their award-winning research and case studies ranging from America Online to the Discovery Channel, marketing experts A. Parasuraman and Charles L. Colby demonstrate how the adoption of technology is influenced by unique beliefs that do not apply to conventional products and services. In the context of a general set of powerful techno-marketing strategies, Parasuraman and Colby introduce \"Technology Readiness\" (TR), a groundbreaking concept that enables you to measure and assess a customer's predisposition to adopt new technologies. Employing their TR construct -- a psychological amalgam of fears, hopes, desires, and frustrations about technology -- the authors identify five types of technology customers: the highly optimistic and innovative \"Explorers,\" the innovative yet cautious \"Pioneers,\" the uncertain \"Skeptics\" who need the benefits of technology proved, the insecure \"Paranoids,\" and the resistant \"Laggards.\" Using this typology, you can customize your technology strategies by combining insights from your context-specific assessments with general marketing strategies presented in the book. Essential reading in technology companies will be the chapter devoted to Parasuraman's Pyramid Model, which explains the critical role technology plays in a marketing organization as a link between employees, the organization, and the customer. Finally, the authors have included a self-administered quiz so you can score your own Technology Readiness and a chapter on the \"Techno-Ready Marketing Audit\" to provide a framework for taking immediate action based on the precepts in this book.",

        "Description": "Shackleton's own thrilling account of his first Antarctic expedition and astonishing march to reach the South Pole.With the same drama and adventure of Shackleton's later memoir, South, Heart of the Antarctic chronicles the first polar expedition he led himself, which lasted over a year and included triumph, defeat, and harrowing experiences. In 1906, Lieutenant Ernest Shackleton decided that he would make his own attempt to reach the South Pole, having been frustrated by his experiences on Captain Robert Scott's recent effort. His own expedition underwent such ordeals as the hazardous maneuvers to land on the icy Antarctic coast, the scaling of the 13,000-foot volcanic Mount Erebus, and wintering the polar blizzards before setting off for the South Pole. Shackleton's tension-filled account of his \"Farthest South,\" reaching within 97 miles of his goal, is matched only by the return journey's race against time, an exhausted forced march back to camp before their ship sailed without them.\"A more interesting book of polar exploration . . . has yet to be written.\" - New York Times Book Review\"The book will takes its place among the great records of adventure . . .

        "Description": "An economic revolution is transforming America. It's called The New Mainstream.The New Mainstream explains how Americans will eat, work, play, learn, and spend money in the twenty-first century -- and why any organization that ignores the lessons of the New Mainstream is doomed to fail.In The New Mainstream, Guy Garcia offers us both a wake-up call and a road map to the new multicultural reality in America. The New Mainstream is a corporate survival guide for the uncharted markets of the twenty-first century as well as an intellectual toolkit for anyone hoping to get a handle on -- or get ahead of -- the demographic and marketing trends of today's increasingly diverse global society.Somewhere between the moment when salsa replaced ketchup as the nation's most popular condiment and the rise of a pugnacious white rapper named Eminem to a top-selling recording artist, America changed for good.The change was both subtle and seismic. The change was demographic and social, cutting across corporations and organizations, and putting a multicultural spin on everything from business and politics to entertainment and technology. Mainstream America, the way we knew it, was gone for good. But what has replaced it?The New Mainstream is the most profitable sector of the U.S. economy, and it will be the one to have the deepest impact on the very nature of what it means to be an American.Led by the growing statistical and buying power of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, the New Mainstream is the loose coalition of minorities that have been forced to forge their own identity outside the Old Mainstream -- even as they use and consume mass-media and mass-produced products targeted to the general public. This new consumer economy is transforming how products and services are developed, marketed, and bought. And by tapping the core values that have helped to make the United States the world's most powerful country, the multicultural consumer is also America's best hope for the future.",

        "Description": "The neoconomy: a place without taxes, without a social safety net, where rich and poor live in different financial worlds \u2014 and it's coming to America.    The first glimpses of the neoconomy appeared during the Reagan administration, but were soon clouded by a legacy of sky-high budget deficits. George H. W. Bush couldn't afford the neoconomy. In the Clinton years,its prospects all but disappeared in a flurry of economic fine-tuning that delivered record-setting budget surpluses and  rock-bottom unemployment rates. But just when you  might have counted it out, the neoconomy found a savior. George W.Bush was a businessman who understood the neoconomy almost instinctively, and had the will and boldness to make it a reality.    In Neoconomy Daniel Altman explains the intellectual roots of the Bush administration's economic policy; and why Bush has been so intent on implementing it despite the dashed expectations, terror and financial scandals that  have buffeted the economy. He shows why the neoconomists remain committed to their vision even though it has contributed to the biggest budget deficit in history, at the end of the nation's fastest-ever swing into the red. The  neconomists are seeking to transform the American economy; but inadvertently or not, they are also transforming American society. The revolution is finally coming,and it's coming from above.",

It is the way we live in our everyday world that determines the shape of who we are. So Buddhist or Muslim, Christian or Jew, it is the moment when our daughter doesn't make the basketball team, or our best friend lands our dream job, or our business instinct tells us to bury the guy across the boardroom table that tests and builds our living faith.  With an attitude of hope, a call to forgive, a celebration of miracles, and the promise of strength and grace, Williamson helps us find our sacred footing on ordinary ground.  No matter where we are or what we're doing, there is the opportunity to be happy, and to be holy. The large and small difficulties of our days challenge us to open our hearts and minds. And in this book of hours, Marianne Williamson teaches us to ride the currents that lurk in each of those moments of opening to a sea change of the soul.",

Prodded by his father, Glitsky asks the new homicide lieutenant about the case, but the brass tells him in no uncertain terms to stay out of it. Guided by the Patrol Special -- a private police force supervised by the SFPD that is a holdover from San Francisco's vigilante past-the police have already targeted their prime suspect: John Holiday, proprietor of a run-down local bar, and a friend and client of Dismas Hardy.  While Dismas Hardy has built a solid legal practice and a happy family, John Holiday has not followed the same path. Despite this, Hardy has remained Holiday's attorney and confidant, and with Glitsky's help, Hardy finds ample reason to question Holiday's guilt. Hardy's case falls on hostile ears, however, and to avoid arrest, Holiday turns fugitive. The police now believe three things: that Hardy is a liar protecting Holiday, that Holiday is a cold-blooded killer, and that Glitsky is a bad cop on the wrong side of the law.  As the suspense reaches fever pitch, Hardy, Glitsky, and even their families are caught in the crossfire and directly threatened.  The police won't protect them. The justice system won't defend them. Shunned within the corridors of power, and increasingly isolated at every turn, Hardy and Glitsky face their darkest hour. For when the law forsakes them, they must look to another, more primal law in order to survive.  A brilliant and emotionally powerful thrill-ride through the twisting streets of San Francisco, The First Law is John Lescroart's most immediate and electrifying novel to date.",

        "Description": "Compromising Positions to Lily White--seven critically acclaimed novels, seven New York Times bestsellers. Now, with her eighth novel, Susan Isaacs has written her finest work yet. Red, White and Bluetells the story of two ordinary Americans who find it within themselves to become extraordinary heroes.  Charlie Blair of Wyoming and Lauren Miller of New York start out as strangers. They are drawn together by an appalling hate crime and by their mutual passion for justice. Yet they share more than a sense of fair play. They are not simply kindred spirits but actual kin, descendants of immigrants who met on a boat on their way to America, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty.Special Agent Blair of the FBI has the numbing job of a bureaucrat and the soul of a cowboy. A wry Westerner from his Stetson to his boots, he also happens to be the great-great-grandson of . . . Dora Blaustein? Dora what? True, although he is unaware of that particular ancestor. A nearly burned-out case at thirty-four, he is about to walk away from the safe world of paper-pushing to risk his life in Wyoming, infiltrating an armed, white supremacist, viciously anti-Semitic group called Wrath. Wyoming born and bred, Charlie seems the perfect choice for this undercover operation, because who in Wrath could question this whiter-than-white man, so clearly one of their own?  Also in Jackson Hole is Charlie's apparent opposite. Gen-X Lauren Miller is articulate, ironic--and unwaveringly liberal. A journalist from Long Island, she has been hired by the Jewish News to investigate a bombing that Wrath is suspected to be behind. Lauren's job is to know who, what, where and when, of course. But most of all, she is compelled to discover why.  Why are all these people who've never met a Jew in their lives obsessed with Jews--and why do they want them dead? Just who is it who gets to define who is an American? With narrative grace, insight and her trademark exuberant wit, Isaacs not only chronicles Lauren's and Charlie's investigations, but explores their American heritage as well: How did their forebears--how did all of our forebears--get from there to here? And what can this mountain man and this suburban woman possibly share--except a few random genes?  Intelligent, exhilarating and intensely moving, Red, White and Blue is a novel about what makes Americans American.",

Or if you will be released from captivity the next day - or killed.Terry Anderson's memoir is not only about how he survived, but also about how his spirit endured and triumphed. Physically imprisoned, beaten, treated more as an object than as a human being, Anderson found out how the human spirit can reach beyond the bars of prison.This is both the story of his physical captivity and all of its harrowing drama and the parallel accounts of those throughout the world to whom he was connected by love and hope - his sister, Peggy Say; his fiancee, Madeleine Bassil; and his daughter, Sulome - as well as friends and colleagues who, like Terry, never gave up.And there are some startling revelations from Washington and elsewhere as to why Terry Anderson (and the other hostages) were taken - and what was really happening behind the events of Iran-Contra and America's involvement in the lethal confusions of politics and terrorism in the Middle East.Above all, this is the story of Terry and his fellow hostages - what they shared and how they supported one another in the days and years of darkness.",

        "Authors": "By Biddle, Cordelia Frances and Hearst, Patricia",
        "Description": "The time was the Roaring Twenties: those prosperous, carefree years after World War I and before the Great Depression. Hollywood was in the throes of talkies, and California's Gold Coast had become a mecca for the world's greatest stars. Newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst built a castle by the sea for his film star mistress Marion Davies and named it San Simeon. It became a playground for the rich and famous, celebrated for its posh parties and envied for its exclusivity. But in 1924, Hearst would briefly quit both his beloved San Simeon and Marion after the suspicious death of the film producer Thomas Ince aboard the Oneida, Hearst's luxury steam yacht. The guests the night of the murder included Charlie Chaplin and his young wife; John Barrymore; Elinor Glyn and her female lover; and Marion Davies and William Randolph Hearst. The public pounced on the story. Even the Hearst newspapers couldn't control rumors of illegal, drunken behavior; of sexual excesses and jealous rages; of murder at San Simeon. The unsolved mystery became part of Hollywood lore.Catha Kinsolving Burke, an associate professor of history at Occidental College, never imagined that the death of her mother would throw her into the middle of a seventy-year-old drama. But her mother's deathbed words - \"San Simeon\" - compel Catha to visit the castle. During a tour, she overhears a tourist discussing the infamous murder and the woman wrongly charged - a woman named Abigail Kinsolving.The information leads Catha to Ethan Purnell, the original investigator of the Ince murder, who now resides in a nursing home. He permits her to examine his papers, which he has stored with his nephew, an idealistic young environmental lawyer named Lucas. Catha's desire for the truth becomes Lucas's, and the two will stop at nothing to achieve some sense of closure. Catha finds herself immersed in the surreal world of San Simeon in the 1920s and its glittering cast of characters as she uncovers many truths - about the murder, about her family, and about herself.",

And outside of Seattle a young woman arrives in a dimly-lit bar to pick up a computer disk wrapped in a white handkerchief. Moments later, she stumbles upon the body of her contact, dead in the bathroom. To Allie Kerry, the pickup was no more than a business arrangement--no hassles, no strings--easy money. Suddenly Allie is on the run. Someone is setting her up to take the fall. Someone who knows what's on the disk. Someone who will stop at nothing to conceal the evidence of a horrific crime.

Peter decides this is his only chance to prove to his father that he is the terrific lawyer he knows himself to be, and he chooses to carry on with the case against his father's wishes. In his zeal to prove himself, Peter neglects his client and ends up losing everything - the case, his job, and his father.Unemployed and disinherited, Peter takes the only job he is offered - that of a public defender in a small Oregon town. He hopes that if he can make good there, he can reinstate himself in his father's good graces. But his ambition again gets the best of him when he takes on a death-penalty case, representing a mentally retarded man accused of the brutal hatchet murder of a college coed. He's in way over his head, and it's only when Peter realizes that his greed and his ego may end up killing his client that he begins to understand what it really takes to be a good lawyer - and to become a man.",

In Now, Let Me Tell You What I Really Think, Chris Matthews is at his brilliant, blunt, bulldogged best.  From the Cold War to the Clinton years, Matthews gives the straight-up account of what it means to be an American. Matthews tells us about his \"God and Country\" Catholic school education in Philadelphia, complete with Cold War air-raid drills, and his early enthusiasm for politics. He shares with us his life's adventures -- two years in Africa with the Peace Corps, the challenge of running for Congress in his twenties, and his three decades deep in the \"belly of the beast\" of American politics -- using his own experiences to give us an irreverent look at who we are and whom we trust to lead us.",

Elroy and his wife, Clare, perhaps too comfortable with each other, decide to try living separately, a choice that is characteristic of their relationship - fond, thoughtful, generous to a fault, and more than a little cracked.So Elroy leases a high-rise beach condo and begins hanging out with his twenty-something students while Clare tends the home fires. Elroy hooks up with a patchy young woman from New Mexico, Freddie, a talented painter, Edward Works, and their friends, and experiences a splendid reenchantment with the world. But when an unforeseen tragedy throws his, and everyone's, infirmities into high relief, he's confronted with reordering, retracking - and reimagining - a world that seems to have suddenly gone haywire.",

In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from Little League carpool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too, if her chic house, personal trainer, BMW and her loving son are any indication. So what if there's been no one to share her bed with lately, let alone rock her world? Stella doesn't mind too much; she probably wouldn't have the energy for love - and all of love's nasty fallout - anyway.But when Stella takes a spur-of-the-moment vacation to Jamaica, her world gets rocked to the core not just by the relaxing effects of sun and sea and an island full of attractive men, but by one man in particular. He's tall, lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, smells of citrus and the ocean - and is half her age. The tropics have cast their spell and Stella soon realizes she has come to a cataclysmic juncture: not only must she confront her hopes and fears about love, she must question all of her expectations, passions, and ideas about life and the way she has lived it.",

But one summer Sunday, Marty comes across something different on the road just past the old Shiloh schoolhouses -- a young beagle -- and the trouble begins. What do you do when a dog you suspect is being mistreated runs away and comes to you? When it is someone else's dog? When the man who owns him has a gun? This is Marty's problem, and he finds it is one he has to face alone. When his solution gets too big for him to handle, things become more frightening still. Marty puts his courage on the line, and discovers in the process that it is not always easy to separate right from wrong. Sometimes, however, you do almost anything to save a dog.",

When their candidate wins, both are given jobs in the new administration, his as an increasingly prominent speechwriter and hers in the Office of Social Affairs. But then Ben finds out that Gretchen has been sleeping with his boss, the president, and he confronts her. Gretchen swears her love for Ben and vows to do anything to ensure their future happiness together ... except end the affair. She has gained the ultimate Washington prize: one-on-one \"face-time\" with the president. And, perhaps not coincidentally, Ben's stock as a speechwriter has never been higher. But is the professional success worth the personal price?Far more than an echo of recent headlines, this novel by Washington insider Erik Tarloff is an important work of politically inspired fiction that poses a culturally resonant question: In a society that venerates power and celebrity, how far are we willing to go to bring ourselves in proximity to them?",

John Quincy Watson was a skilled young pilot flying B-29s over Japan when he was shot down and taken prisoner in 1945. Fifty years later, now a prominent religious figure nearing retirement, Bishop Watson believes he has long since overcome the excruciating memories of his months as a POW. But a chance sighting of the now equally elderly Japanese officer who repeatedly tortured him instantly transports the Bishop back to that unendurable time, and he finds himself overwhelmed by an uncontrollable desire for vengeance. The result for Watson is both a vivid return to the horrors of his past and the triggering of a new series of events that are also horrific - and tragic.The Special Prisoner delves into the complicated issue of war guilt and forgiveness, starkly portrayed in the characters of an officer from a country that refuses to admit any wrongdoing and a clergyman who is committed to a belief that to forgive is divine.",
