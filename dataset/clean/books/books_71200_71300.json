J ust as with his remarkable military novels, millions of readers have been captured by the rich characters and vivid realism of W. E. B. Griffin's police dramas. \"Griffin has the knack,\" writes The Philadelphia Inquirer. \"He sets his novel before you in short, fierce, stop-for-nothing scenes. Before you know it, you've gobbled it up.\" Homicide Sergeant Matthew Payne is used to murder, but lately there's been an awful lot of it in Philadelphia. A gangland shooting in a popular tourist location has left six dead, most of them innocent bystanders, and days later the body of a headless Latina turns up in the Schuykill River. Everybody assumes they're not related, but Payne can't shake the hunch that there's something more to it-and that hunch leads him far from the City of Brotherly Love to the Texas-Mexico border. There, he finds a world where the lines of law and order are murkier than he ever imagined possible, and the daily question is \" O Plato o Plomo?\" Silver or lead. Cash or death. Which will Matt Payne take? Or will he just go home, glad to be alive . . . ? Filled with authentic color and detail, this is a riveting novel of the men and women who put their lives on the line, from the cop on the beat to the commissioner himself. It's a story of fears, dangers, courage, loyalty, and genuine heroism: storytelling at its best.",

It is 1907, a year of financial panic and labor unrest. Train wrecks, fires, and explosions sabotage the Southern Pacific Railroad?s Cascades express line and, desperate, the railroad hires the fabled Van Dorn Detective Agency. Van Dorn sends in his best man, and Bell quickly discovers that a mysterious saboteur haunts the hobo jungles of the West, a man known as the Wrecker, who recruits accomplices from the down-and-out to attack the railroad, and then kills them afterward. The Wrecker traverses the vast spaces of the American West as if he had wings, striking wherever he pleases, causing untold damage and loss of human life. Who is he? What does he want? Is he a striker? An anarchist? A revolutionary determined to displace the ?privileged few?? A criminal mastermind engineering some as yet unexplained scheme? Whoever he is, whatever his motives, the Wrecker knows how to create maximum havoc, and Bell senses that he is far from done?that, in fact, the Wrecker is building up to a grand act unlike anything he has committed before. If Bell doesn?t stop him in time, more than a railroad could be at risk?it could be the future of the entire country. Filled with intricate plotting and dazzling set pieces, The Wrecker is one of the most entertaining thrillers in years.",

A tanking economy has prompted Dr. Kay Scarpetta-despite her   busy schedule and her continuing work as the senior forensic analyst for CNN- to offer her services pro bono to New   York City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. In no time at all, her increased visibility seems to precipitate a   string of unexpected and unsettling events. She is asked live on the air about the sensational case of Hannah Starr,   who has vanished and is presumed dead. Moments later during the same telecast, she receives a startling call-in   from a former psychiatric patient of Benton Wesley's. When she returns after the show to the apartment where she   and Benton live, she finds an ominous package-possibly a bomb-waiting for her at the front desk. Soon the   apparent threat on Scarpetta's life finds her embroiled in a surreal plot that includes a famous actor accused of an   unthinkable sex crime and the disappearance of a beautiful millionairess with whom Lucy seems to have shared a   secret past. Scarpetta's CNN producer wants her to launch a TV show called The Scarpetta   Factor. Given the bizarre events already in play, she fears that her growing fame will generate the illusion that   she has a \"special factor,\" a mythical ability to solve all her cases. She wonders if she will end up like other TV   personalities: her own stereotype. The Scarpetta Factor, the seventeenth in the series, finds the   familiar cast of characters together again in New York. Marino is working for the NYPD; Benton Wesley uses his   forensic psycho\u00adlogical expertise at Kirby and Bellevue; and Lucy continues to dazzle with her expertise in forensic   computer investigations as she works yet another case with NY prosecutor Jaime Berger.

An occasional thank you would suffice; instead, his resentful sibling forges his name to a marriage license and presents him with an unwanted wife. She's a vicar's widow with a mind of her own who may be the first person in Marcus's well-ordered life to make him feel. . .completely out of control.Hannah can't help but curse her own idiocy. Dire straits have led her to the altar with a gentleman she hardly knows.

Reluctantly, she agrees to play the wife until he can sort out the mess. But the nearness of the undeniably attractive Duke and the passion in his black eyes unsettles her well-guarded heart--making her want to do so much more than \"act\" the role of blissful bride. . .

        "Description": "Hurricane Katrina shredded one of the great cities of the South, and as levees failed and the federal relief effort proved lethally incompetent, a natural disaster became a man-made catastrophe. As an editor of New Orleans\u2019 daily newspaper, the Pulitzer Prize\u2014winning Times-Picayune, Jed Horne has had a front-row seat to the unfolding drama of the city\u2019s collapse into chaos and its continuing struggle to survive.As the Big One bore down, New Orleanians rich and poor, black and white, lurched from giddy revelry to mandatory evacuation. The thousands who couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t leave initially congratulated themselves on once again riding out the storm. But then the unimaginable happened: Within a day 80 percent of the city was under water. The rising tides chased horrified men and women into snake-filled attics and onto the roofs of their houses. Heroes in swamp boats and helicopters braved wind and storm surge to bring survivors to dry ground. Mansions and shacks alike were swept away, and then a tidal wave of lawlessness inundated the Big Easy. Screams and gunshots echoed through the blacked-out Superdome. Police threw away their badges and joined in the looting. Corpses drifted in the streets for days, and buildings marinated for weeks in a witches\u2019 brew of toxic chemicals that, when the floodwaters finally were pumped out, had turned vast reaches of the city into a ghost town.Horne takes readers into the private worlds and inner thoughts of storm victims from all walks of life to weave a tapestry as intricate and vivid as the city itself. Politicians, thieves, nurses, urban visionaries, grieving mothers, entrepreneurs with an eye for quick profit at public expense\u2013all of these lives collide in a chronicle that is harrowing, angry, and often slyly ironic.Even before stranded survivors had been plucked from their roofs, government officials embarked on a vicious blame game that further snarled the relief operation and bedeviled scientists striving to understand the massive levee failures and build New Orleans a foolproof flood defense. As Horne makes clear, this shameless politicization set the tone for the ongoing reconstruction effort, which has been haunted by racial and class tensions from the start.Katrina was a catastrophe deeply rooted in the politics and culture of the city that care forgot and of a nation that forgot to care. In Breach of Faith, Jed Horne has created a spellbinding epic of one of the worst disasters of our time.",

        "Authors": "By Thornton, John F. (EDT), Washburn, Katharine (EDT), Simon, John (INT), and Simon, John (EDT)",
        "Description": "The American scene, once so full of richness, promise, vitality, and achievement, now strikes many critics as a dispiriting carnival of follies, a spectacle of decline. In every area of our lives - including, but not limited to, education, politics, journalism, literature, ethics, film, religion, popular culture, jurisprudence, psychiatry, and even cuisine - one can observe an ominous slippage, a shift towards the bizarre, the third-rate, the purely opportunistic. How did such a vibrant legacy of knowledge, tradition, and competence come to be so rapidly squandered in so short a time? And can this pan-cultural \"dumbing down\" be halted or reversed?This volume collects twenty-three essays - most of them written for this book - that confront such developments with vigor, wit, learning, common sense, and urgency. Contributors include such superb critics and commentators as Philip Lopate, Cynthia Ozick, Michael Vincent Miller, Joseph Epstein, Sven Birkerts, George F. Kennan, Brad Leithauser, and John Simon. Various in their styles, concerns, and political allegiances, they are united in their dismay about a culture in the throes of dismantling itself.

        "Title": "Her Little Majesty: The Life of Queen Victoria",
        "Authors": "By Erickson, Carolly",
        "Description": "With her customary deft mastery of historical narrative, Carolly Erickson reveals the inner contradictions of the resolute, highminded, often cantankerous woman who became queen at the age of eighteen and reigned until her death sixty-four years later. The short, stout Victoria, diminutive in form yet dominating in spirit, emerged as the defining symbol of her age. Seeing herself as a soldier's daughter first and foremost, Victoria stood her ground, armed with her own fortitude, while the forces of social, economic, and religious change swirled about her.In a time when women were becoming redefined as weak and inferior creatures, unfit even to govern themselves and in need of male rule and protection, the sturdy queen convinced herself that she too was in desperate need of a strong man. She found him in Albert, her handsome, well-intentioned, dutiful prince consort. Following the conventions of the time, Victoria stepped back and let Albert appear to be in charge - yet she never let the reins of power fall from her own hands, and after Albert's early death, his grieving widow discovered, much to her surprise, that she had been the stronger one all along.Victoria's emotional ordeal after Albert's death was the worst crisis of her life, and a crucible of self-discovery. Thrown back on her own emotional resources, Victoria faltered, then resurged as her empire grew and Britain's global influence enlarged. Queen, empress, elder stateswoman, matriarch of Europe, Victoria lived on and on, decade after decade, until she came to seem an immemorial presence on the world stage.",

With an ordinary dictionary, you look up the word to find its meaning. With the Illustrated Reverse Dictionary, you do just the opposite: you look up the meaning to find the word.The Illustrated Reverse Dictionary works like a thesaurus, which gives you words that are similar in meaning, but it does more. You start with an idea, a description of the term you're looking for, and the Illustrated Reverse Dictionary leads you through associated words to the exact one you want. Moreover, each synonym is defined, and you get antonyms (word opposites) and etymologies (word histories), which a thesaurus does not offer.Containing over 400,000 words - in more than 70,000 main entries, with over 130 detailed color illustrations, and more than 160 charts, the Illustrated Reverse Dictionary offers quick and accurate reference.",

        "Title": "The Moral Imagination: Confronting the Ethical Issues of Our Day",
        "Authors": "By Tivnan, Edward",
        "Description": "When it comes to the most controversial moral questions of our lives - abortion, euthanasia, suicide, capital punishment, racial justice, and affirmative action - there is a right and wrong, but no one owns the truth. This book guides us through the opposing arguments on these profound issues, opening up ways for our pluralistic society to think about them.How does one make up one's mind about the difficult, yet everyday, inescapable social and moral problems we all face? The public debate often degenerates into name-calling and even violence. Conservatives and liberals alike act as if there is only one way to think.In a format that is accessible, anecdotal, and concrete, Edward Tivnan lays out the best arguments on all sides of these visceral topics. He explores the most sophisticated thinking from philosophy, theology, medicine, and the law, as well as examples from the emotional complexities of everyday life, and carefully mediates between opposing ideals - not to lead us to a position of convenience, but to help us toward independent decisions of conviction.Tivnan's analysis, therefore, does not dictate answers, but calls for an effort to understand and respect why people believe so strongly in their own values. Only by facing up to our differences of opinion can we make progress, expand our moral imagination, and achieve a decent and respectful society.In concluding chapters, Tivnan describes the peculiar nature of American democracy, invented by men who knew that freedom would breed conflicting values and expected that such differences would secure the nation's future as a republican democracy. The first premise of a decent, free society, Tivnan writes, is tolerance; \"the first sparks of tolerance and decency reside in the imagination - what I want to call the moral imagination.\" He concludes that expanding our moral imagination \"will cleanse debate of hatred and moral arrogance.\"",

        "Description": "George W. Bush ran for office promising to continue what  conservative icon Ronald Reagan started, and two years into  his first term, Bush was still being described as \"Reagan's  son.\" Today, with the Iraq War spinning out of control and  the Democrats in charge of Congress, Republicans and the  conservative movement have all but abandoned George W.  Bush. What happened? Did Bush change, or did his party's  perceptions? Has the war and Bush's performance on other  issues derailed the larger goals of the Reagan Revolution?  and even undermined its foundations? Or does the nation  remain on a conservative path despite Bush's low standing  with his fellow Americans?  In Reagan's Disciple, two widely respected reporter/  historians provide an authoritative and concise investigation  into these issues. They describe the essence of the 40th  and the 43rd presidencies, and compare them to shed new  light on the history of the past three decades. They show  both how extraordinary a leader Reagan was, and how preposterous  the expectations for Bush were from the beginning.  As Americans look toward choosing a new leader in  2008, Reagan's Disciple will serve as an instructive tale for  Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike.",
