He pleads with them. He bargains with them. He threatens to run away to a family that doesn't ever go out for the evening. He tells them he's sick, with a temperature of maybe a hundred and ten. And he tells them he won't -- he'll never -- say good-bye. Every child, and every child's parent, will recognize this oh-so-familiar struggle between grown-ups trying to go out for an evening and a child who is fiercely determined to make them stay. It's hard to say good-bye -- but maybe a book that helps you to laugh can make saying good-bye a little easier.",

Fannie Mae's chairman and CEO James A. Johnson - the most significant leader in our country's housing finance system - has dedicated his organization to reducing housing costs, eliminating mortgage discrimination, and expanding opportunities for the millions of Americans who dream of owning their own homes. In this book, Johnson explains the major forces shaping current patterns of home ownership and describes new ways of making homes more affordable to all Americans. He shows how recent forces like the investor-based mortgage system, advances in technology, changing demographics, and other factors are converging to create the greatest increase in home ownership since the post-World War II housing boom.Johnson reveals the details of the plans Fannie Mae is pursuing in order to increase home ownership, strengthen the housing industry and boost the economy. He relates the history of home ownership to the cultural, economic, and political landscape of the United States. And his exploration of discrimination and the many other barriers that keep people from buying homes today will be of particular interest to real estate executives, mortgage bankers, community leaders, policy makers, and potential home owners.",

Work-whether it's in the home or at an office-is what mostly runs our lives. We depend on it to eat, to clothe and shelter ourselves, and to take care of our families. Beginning with a direct correlation between productivity and happiness, Dr. Cutler questions His Holiness about the nature of work. In psychiatry and according to the Dalai Lama, our motivation for working determines our level of satisfaction. The book explores three levels of focus: survival, career, and calling.\u00a0Once again, Cutler walks us through the Dalai Lama's reasoning so that we know how to apply the wisdom to daily life. This practical application of Buddhist ideas\u00a0is an invaluable source of strength and peace for anyone who earns a living.",

The Dance of Deceptionunravels the ways (and whys) that women show the false and hide the real -- even to our own selves. We see how relationships are affected by lying and faking, by silence and pretending and by brave -- but misguided -- efforts to tell the truth.Truth-telling is at the heart of what is most central in women's lives. It is at the foundation of authenticity and creativity, intimacy and joy. Yet in the name of \"honesty\", we can bludgeon each other. We can approach a difficult issue with such a poor sense of timing and tact that we can actually shut down the lines of communication rather than widening the path of truth-telling.Sometimes Lerner's advice takes a surprising turn -- for example, when she asks us to engage in a bold act of pretending in order to discover something \"more real\"; or when she tells us not to parachute down on our family to bring up a \"hot issue\" without laying the necessary groundwork first.Whether the subject is affairs, family secrets, sexual faking or the challenge of \"being oneself\", Lerner helps us to discover, speak and live our own truths.",

        "Title": "Grant Us Courage: Travels Along the Mainline of American Protestantism",
        "Authors": "By Balmer, Randall Herbert",
        "Description": "In 1950, Christian Century ran a series of articles on twelve churches, some large, some small, each representing a strand of American mainline Protestantism. Now, nearly fifty years later, Randall Balmer--author and host ofMine Eyes Have Seen the Glory, the acclaimed book and PBS series on American evangelicism--has revisited each of these twelve churches to take the pulse of Protestantism today. The result is a remarkable narrative, graced with touches of local color and memorable portraits of the people involved, and filled with deft observations and carefully nuanced insights about Protestantism at century's end.Much as he did in Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory, Balmer crisscrosses America to give us a first-hand look at how Christianity has fared in the last half-century. What emerges is a church challenged by diminished influence, but with signs of hope for the future. For instance, he takes us to West Hartford, Connecticut, where we learn how a gregarious pastor, Bob Heppenstall, rekindled the spirit of the First Church of Christ Congregational--still housed in its stately, classic New England meetinghouse--that had suffered from inept management until recent years. And in Ames, Iowa, at the Collegiate United Methodist Church, we watch George White struggle to regain his church's once dominant voice in the religious life of the town, a voice now dimmed by the growth of fundamentalism. Some churches have held steadfastly to long-established roles, such as the Washington Prairie Lutheran Church, in Decorah, Iowa, which has been a model of continuity, serving its Norwegian-American community in much the same way since it was founded in 1851. And Balmer also visits some thriving churches, such as Hollywood's First Presbyterian Church, led by the great preacher John Lloyd Ogilvie, who was recently appointed chaplain of the U.S. Senate. In Minneapolis, Balmer encounters Mount Olivet Lutheran Church, a congregation that has not only increased its membership, but can now call itself the biggest Lutheran church in the world.In Grant Us Courage, one of our most thoughtful chroniclers of the American scene offers an intimate look at mainline Protestantism at the close of the century. We come away with the feeling of having been there, of having listened to the voices of an important segment of Christian life, and of having found a deeper understanding of religious life in America today.",

The book shows how a decade of indifference turned this vital agency responsible for ensuring the safety of our food and drugs into a partner with industry - and the consumer's worst friend.The FDA Follies is a fascinating saga, revealing in full for the first time: how a few generic drug manufacturers bribed FDA reviewers into getting their products to the marketplace early, how a determined band of AIDS activists took on the FDA and forever changed the way our drugs are approved and marketed, how the FDA and the blood bank industry let precious years slip by while the nation's blood supply was contaminated with the HIV virus, how the agency approved faulty heart valves that killed and silicone breast implants that flattered women while maiming them, and how those famous killer grapes from Chile were actually poisoned in the FDA's own laboratories.The book concludes with an analysis of how a reformed agency under new and active leadership in the 1990s is struggling to retrieve its credibility and authority and become once again the proper guardian of the national health.",

        "Description": "Two years ago, when she was thirty years old, Anne Nivat decided to see first-hand what war was all about. Russia had just launched its second brutal campaign against Chechnya. And though the Russians strictly forbade Westerners from covering the war, the aspiring French journalist decided she would go. There are two very real dangers in Chechnya: being arrested by the Russians and being kidnapped by the Chechens. Nivat strapped her satellite phone to her belly, disguised herself in the garb of a Chechen peasant, and sneaked across the border. She found a young guide, Islam, to lead her illegally through the war zone. For six months they followed the war, travelling with underground rebels and sleeping with Chechen families or in abandoned buildings. Anne trembled through air raids; walked through abandoned killing fields; and helped in the halls of bloody hospitals. She interviewed rebel leaders, government officials, young widows, and angry fighters, and she reported everything back to France. Her reports in Lib\u00e9ration led to antiwar demonstrations outside the Russian embassy in Paris. Anne's words move. They are not florid, but terse, cool, dramatic. More than just a war correspondent's report, Chienne de Guerre is a moving story of struggle and self-discovery?the adventures of one young woman who repeatedly tests her own physical and psychological limits in the extremely dangerous and stressful environment of war.",

But he cannot control his desire for Iris Davenport, the African-American woman whose son is Ruby's best friend. During a freak October blizzard, Daniel is stranded at Iris's house and they begin a sexual liaison that eventually imperils all their relationships, Daniel's profession, their children's well-being, their own race- blindness, and their view of themselves as essentially good people.   A Ship Made of Paper captures all the drama, nuance, and helpless intensity of sexual and romantic yearning, and it bears witness to the age-old conflict between the order of the human community and the disorder of desire.",

        "Authors": "By Slater, Robert",
        "Description": "The historic elevation of Yitzhak Rabin to prime minister of Israel in 1992 brought new hope for lasting peace in the Middle East. His Labor party's triumph signaled a new attitude on the part of the Israeli people, a desire for an end to decades of wearying conflict.Yet this man in whom so many have placed their hopes remains an enigma. Rabin, a fierce and uncompromising military leader whose actions as chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces during the Six Day War led to Israeli control of the West Bank and the Golan Heights, seemed poised to surrender at least part of those gains in the name of peace.Robert Slater, whose acclaimed biography of Moshe Dayan was nominated for the National Jewish Book Award, gives us a fully realized portrait of Rabin based on interviews with Rabin's colleagues, friends, family and Rabin himself, in this, the first biography of the prime minister.Rabin emerges as a shy, diffident, even mysterious man, whose changing fortunes seem to echo the contradictions within himself. His first tenure as prime minister during the mid-1970s was marked by both his resolute actions during the Entebbe hostage crisis and his ignominious resignation as the result of a petty financial scandal. Yet Rabin was returned to office at one of the most crucial moments in Israel's history.",

The Marathon, an inimitable rope of caramel covered in chocolate. Oompahs. Bit-O-Choc. The Kit Kat Dark. Steve Almond certainly does. In fact, he was so obsessed by the inexplicable disappearance of these bars\u2014where'd they go?\u2014that he embarked on a nationwide journey to uncover the truth about the candy business. There, he found an industry ruled by huge conglomerates, where the little guys, the last remaining link to the glorious boom years of the candy bar in America, struggle to survive. Visiting the candy factories that produce the Twin Bing, the Idaho Spud, the Goo Goo Cluster, the Valomilk, and a dozen other quirky bars, Almond finds that the world of candy is no longer a sweet haven. Today's precious few regional candy makers mount daily battles against corporate greed, paranoia, and that good old American compulsion: crushing the little guy.  Part candy porn, part candy polemic, part social history, part confession, Candyfreak explores the role candy plays in our lives as both source of pleasure and escape from pain. By turns ecstatic, comic, and bittersweet, Candyfreak is the story of how Steve Almond grew up on candy\u2014and how, for better and worse, candy has grown up, too.",

She argues with her readers and expects them to argue back. Her taste for liberty, her legal training, wit, and innate contrarianism help her elude the usual political labels and inform her writings on censorship, feminism, pop psychology, religion, criminal justice, and a range of rights and liberties at issue in the culture wars.In this new collection, Kaminer has her sights set on the fate civil liberties in America. Opening with a powerful overview of liberty's tenuous hold on this \"land of the free,\" Kaminer offers incisive, original investigations of political freedom in our frightened, post-September 11 world and reviews perennial threats to sexual and religious liberty, free speech, privacy, and the right to be free from unwarranted, unprincipled prosecutions. She writes with a sense of the past, an understanding of the present, and concern about the future of American freedom.Lindsay Nelson has written a Discussion Guide to Free For All for Unitarian Universalist Communities.Wendy Kaminer is the author of many books, including I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional: The Recovery Movement and Other Self-help Fashions; A Fearful Freedom: Women's Flight from Equality; It's All the Rage: Crime and Culture; True Love Waits; and most recently Sleeping with Extra-Terrestrials: The Rise of Irrationalism and the Perils of Piety.

Since the World War I service of Yeoman (F) Loretta Perfectus Walsh - the first U.S. servicewoman not a nurse - through the Gulf War and the recent Tailhook scandal, women have struggled for acceptance within the U.S. Navy. This book tells a fascinating story of two currents crossing and recrossing, sometimes conflicting, sometimes converging. One current is the Navy's attempt to include women gradually without losing its traditional values. The other is that of women challenging the Navy's assumptions, their aspirations rising as their opportunities widen. And as any sailor knows, where currents cross the waters are troubled. Jean Ebbert and Marie-Beth Hall have written a comprehensive and inspiring history that covers Tailhook in depth and shows why it was to be expected. Crossed Currents will make waves.",

        "Authors": "By Djerassi, Carl",
        "Description": "This novel, like Jurassic Park, hinges on the real-world technology incorporated in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), one of the most important breakthroughs in biomedical science. The 1993 Nobel Prize in chemistry recognized the immense significance of PCR, which is a process for quickly generating and then infinitely replicating fragments of genetic material.An impostor takes all of the credit in Carl Djerassi's fictionalized account of PCR's discovery and development. As the scientific community eventually discovers, Professor Diana Skordylis is not really one of their own, she is four of their own--three men and a woman--who publish their collaborative work under the Skordylis pseudonym. Two of them American, one Japanese, and one Austrian, they average around sixty-five years of age. Their archetype is a famous group of French mathematicians who actually have been publishing collectively for several decades under the nom de plume of Nicolas Bourbaki.Revenge is the Skordylis group's initial motivation. Victims of subtle age discrimination, they have all seen their research budgets and faculty privileges curtailed; two have been forcibly retired. Each Skordylis project they complete, each paper they publish under her name, is a satisfying poke at a scientific community that marginalized its senior members.But PCR is different. It is not only their best work, it is among the best work done by any scientist in recent memory. Professional jealousy soon threatens Diana Skordylis's life, as some group members struggle with the urge to claim their share of the fame and separately seek out PCR's most innovative applications.Djerassi writes engagingly--and from experience--about the collaborative nature at the heart of the scientific enterprise and the desire for personal recognition in the hearts of most scientists; about the graying of Western science; and about the human frailties and humanistic concerns of its practitioners.",

        "Title": "Where Next, Columbus?: The Future of Space Exploration",
        "Authors": "By Neal, Valerie (EDT)",
        "Description": "In the decades since the launch of Sputnik, the world has thrilled to the long-dreamed-of moon walks of the Apollo astronauts, marvelled at spectacular photographs of the outer planets brought to us by Voyager, and watched in horror as the Challenger exploded before our eyes. No longer the terrifying realm of science fiction, space has been hailed by popular culture as the \"final frontier,\" the focal point of future exploration. Yet today there is no strong consensus about our future in space. Where should we go next? Mars? Deep space? Should we continue to send humans into space? Is it worth the cost to explore space at all? Now, a curator of space history at the Smithsonian, Valerie Neal, has assembled a noted group of writers and thinkers--among them Stephen Jay Gould, Carl Sagan, Timothy Ferris, Robert L. Forward, and Stephen J. Pyne--to consider such questions. The result is an intriguing collection of essays that offer stimulating insights into the exploration of new worlds.  Boasting an oversize format and more than fifty color illustrations, this engaging volume offers readers a fascinating look at exploration's past and future. Several pieces vividly depict the actual experience of space travel and the many scientific findings made along the way. Harrison H. Schmitt, the last astronaut to set foot on the moon, provides an often spellbinding account of that adventure, in the process making a compelling case for human rather than robotic explorers (during the examination of a boulder, Schmitt made a discovery that a mere circuit-board would have missed--and that is to say nothing of the poetic earth-rise he describes).  But robots get equal time. Edward C. Stone, Project Scientist for the Voyager missions, describes other worlds as seen from the camera-eye of a machine millions of miles away: the roiling storm systems on Jupiter, the complexity of Saturn's rings, and the spectacular nitrogen geysers on Triton, one of Neptune's major satellites. Looking towards the future, Stephen Jay Gould pleads for a manned mission to Mars, one which would scour the Red Planet for signs of life (paleontologists have found fossilized bacteria in Earth silica, Gould explains, and similar fossils on Mars may be the key to proving that life once existed there). And physicist Robert L. Forward offers detailed plans for actual starships that could send astronauts to the nearest star system in a single lifetime--and with today's technology.    Where Next, Columbus? is an utterly absorbing contribution to a debate that may help define the twenty-first century. With colorful illustrations, a spacious oversized format, and ten fascinating essays--all but one of which have never been published before--this volume will intrigue anyone interested in space travel or our place in the universe.",

Eisenhower once remarked that \"the history of alliances is a history of failure.\" This provocative, absorbing work, based on a study by the General and written by his son, is a history of one of the great exceptions, the most successful military alliance the world has ever seen?the Anglo-American military alliance of World War II. At once a study of the prodigious undertaking that brought millions of men and women together to defeat the Axis and a portrait of the great personalities who built and sustained the alliance, Allies offers vivid glimpses of war at the working level: on a convoy crossing the Atlantic, with a secret landing party on the coast of northern Africa, and with armored units in Tunisia. Eisenhower has crafted a powerful narrative and a most valuable contribution to the literature of World War II.",
