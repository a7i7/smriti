That they can't scream very loudly since they just have tiny little baby lungs? That you will still be able to golf on weekends after your baby is born?  If so, you need this book!  Breathe takes guys misstep-by-misstep through the stages of pregnancy and the early days of childhood. Considered by many to be the unofficial pregnancy handbook of the NBA, Breathe is filled with useful tips such as these:  Brown's First Law of Conception: The odds of conception are inversely proportional to its desirability. High school virgins experimenting behind bleachers are guaranteed to get pregnant; financially secure married men hoping for children are doomed to spend their weekends in fertility clinics masturbating into cups.  Picking a doctor: Never use a gynecologist whose Medical School Diploma has palm trees on the side.  Pre-Natal Music: Mozart, yes. Wagner, No!  Common Concerns: If your baby is born with dark hair that covers its head, back, neck, temples and forehead, don't panic. This is perfectly normal. It just means your baby was born Italian.  Child experts from all over the world agree -- if you're a first time father, drop your baby and pick up this book!",

And now that she has to temporarily share her room with Josh, Jo's head is really in a spin -- because with her hometown beau still in the picture and a sexy possibility sleeping just a foot away, life has suddenly gotten very complicated indeed!",

        "Authors": "By Gao, Xingjian and Lee, Mabel",
        "Description": "In 1983 Chinese playwright, critic, fiction writer, and painter Gao Xingjian (pronounced gow shing-jen) was diagnosed with lung cancer and faced imminent death.\u00a0 But six weeks later, a second examination revealed there was no cancer -- he had won \"a reprieve from death\" and had been thrown back into the world of the living.\u00a0 Faced with a repressive cultural environment and the threat of a spell in a prison farm, Gao fled Beijing.\u00a0 He traveled to the remote mountains and ancient forests of Sichuan in southwest China and from there back to the east coast, a journey of fifteen thousand kilometers over a period of five months.\u00a0 The results of this epic voyage of discovery is Soul Mountain.A bold, lyrical, prodigious novel, Soul Mountain probes the human soul with an uncommon directness and candor.\u00a0 Interwoven with the myriad of stories and countless memorable characters -- from venerable Daosit masters and Buddhist nuns to mythical Wild Men, deadly Qichun snakes, and farting buses -- is the narrator's poignant inner journey and search for freedom. Fleeing the social conformity required by the Communist government, he wanders deep into the regions of the Qiang, Miago, and Yi peoples located on the fringes of Han Chinese civilization and discovers a plethora of different traditions, history, legends, folk songs, and landscapes. Slowly, with the help of memory, imagination, and sensory experience, he reconstructs his personal past. He laments the impact of the Cultural Revolution on the ecology -- both human and physical -- of China. And in a polyphony of narrating selves -- the narrator's \"I\" spawns a \"you,\" a \"she,\" and a \"he,\" each with a distinct perspective and voice -- the novel delights in the freedom of the imagination to expand the notion of the individual self.Storytelling saves the narrator from a deep loneliness that is part of the human condition. His search for meaning -- in life, in the journey -- turns up the possibility that there may be no meaning. The elusive Lingshan (\"Soul Mountain\"), which becomes the object of his quest, never yields up its secrets, but the journey is a rich, strange, provocative, and rewarding one. Soul Mountain is a novel of immense wisdom and profound beauty.",

Let\u2019s call it Random House.\u201d So recounts Bennett Cerf in this wonderfully amusing memoir of the making of a great publishing house. An incomparable raconteur, possessed of an irrepressible wit and an abiding love of books and authors, Cerf brilliantly evokes the heady days of Random House\u2019s first decades.             Part of the vanguard of young New York publishers who revolutionized the book business in the 1920s and \u201930s, Cerf helped usher in publishing\u2019s golden age. Cerf was a true personality, whose other pursuits (columnist, anthologist, author, lecturer, radio host, collector of jokes and anecdotes, perennial judge of the Miss America pageant, and panelist on What\u2019s My Line?) helped shape his reputation as a man of boundless energy and enthusiasm and brought unprecedented attention to his company and to his authors. At once a rare behind-the-scenes account of book publishing and a fascinating portrait of four decades\u2019 worth of legendary authors, from James Joyce and William Faulkner to Ralph Ellison and Eudora Welty, At Random is a feast for bibliophiles and anyone who\u2019s ever wondered what goes on inside a publishing house.",

        "Description": "On a quiet park bench in Manhattan---just miles from the ruins of the World Trade Center---spymaster Jake Janos Illin delivers a chilling secret message to Jake Grafton: A rogue Russian general has sold four nuclear warheads to a radical Islamic terrorist group, the Sword of Islam. The group intends to detonate them in America in the ultimate terror strike, the apocalypse that will trigger a holy war between Western civilization and the Muslim world. After passing Illin\u2019s message to his superiors, Grafton is charged by the president with the task of assembling a secret team to find the warheads before America\u2019s population centers are consumed by a nuclear holocaust.As he hunts for the terrorists, Grafton soon finds himself up to his neck in power politics, techno-billionaires, money-grubbing traitors, anarchists, and spies. He also discovers that the terrorists don\u2019t all come from the Middle East. They come from places close to home. They masquerade as patriots. Some may even have the president\u2019s ear.With the survival of Western civilization at stake, Grafton pulls out all the stops. Calling on the assistance of the indomitable Toad Tarkington, and CIA burglar Tommy Carmellini, he raids the prisons to assemble his team while the clock ticks toward Armageddon.Peopled with the rich, vivid characters that have made Stephen Coonts famous worldwide, Liberty is all action and suspense from the very first page.  And it poses the unanswerable question: How far should civilization go to defend itself from its mortal enemies?",

Ever since she was sixteen, she's been taking off without notice to places as far distant as Papua New Guinea, then returning unexpectedly, only to disappear yet another time, again and again and again.  But this time is different.  Last month, Annie got into serious trouble in Sicily and was briefly held in a mental hospital, where an Italian doctor diagnosed her as schizophrenic. Andrew's divorced mother refuses to accept this diagnosis. Andrew himself just isn't sure. But during the course of a desperate twelve hours in New York City, he and the Gulliver family piece together the past and cope with the present in a journey of revelation and self-discovery. Recognizing the truth at last, Andrew can only hope to find his beloved sister before she harms herself or someone else.

He observes family members during the Revolutionary War; he follows others west as they pioneer in the wilderness of Ohio and Indiana, where schoolteachers were paid in whiskey and door hinges were made of bacon ride. He visits the battlefields where they fought the Civil War. He interviews old-timers, uncles, aunts, cousins, maids, a beer-store owner who knew his dad. Family is a poetic epic of facts, a chronicle of a culture's rise and fall, a memorial, a view of American history as romantic as it is unflinching.",

Peters.A work of profound psychological insight, Prince Friedrich of Homburg probes with passionate intensity questions fundamental to \u201ccivilized\u201d behavior. Prince Friedrich, the hero of the historic battle of Fehrbellin (1675) against the invading Swedes, receives not laurels for his victory but the sentence of death for disobeying orders in the field. Faced with certain execution, his mood swings from abject terror to high-minded exultation as first he challenges, and then accepts, the rule of law and subservience to the state. The action moves relentlessly in the near-frenzied pace characteristic of Kleist. Intended as a paean to a Prussia triumphant in the Napoleonic wars. the play was, ironically, censured and never produced in Kleist's lifetime. In our own day, Prince Friedrich of Homburg has been both denounced as a protofascist work and lauded as a supreme metaphysical disquisition. Whatever the merits of such intellectualization, it remains one of the most moving and performable plays available for the modern stage.",

        "Title": "Plays Well with Others",
        "Authors": "By Gurganus, Allan",
        "Description": "In his widely read, prizewinning Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All, Allan Gurganus gave fresh meaning to an overexplored American moment: 1860-65. He now turns that comic intensity and historical vision to another war zone: entry-level artistic Manhattan 1980-95. In his first novel since Widow, Gurganus offers us an indelible, addictive praise-song to New York's wild recent days, their invigorating peaks and lethal crashes.It's 1980, and Hartley Mims jr., a somewhat overbred Southerner, arrives in town to found his artistic career and find a Circle of brilliant friends. He soon discovers both Robert Christian Gustafson, archangelic boy composer of Symphony no. 1: The Titanic, and Alabama Byrnes, a failed Savannah debutante whose gigantic paintings reveal an outsized talent that she, five feet tall, can't always live up to.This circle--sexually venturesome, frequently hungry, hooked on courage, caffeine, and the promise of immortality--makes history and most everybody else. Their dramatic moment in New York history might've been a collaboration begun, as a toast, by Cole Porter and finished, as pure elegy, by Poe himself. Plays Well with Others is a fairy tale. It has a Legend's indoctrinating charm and hidden terrors. It chronicles a ragtag group of gifted kids who come to seek their fortunes; they find the low-paying joys of making art and the heady education only multiple erotic partners can provide. Having mythologized each other through the boom years, having commenced becoming \"names,\" they suddenly encounter a brand-new disease like something out of fifth-rate sci-fi. Friends are soon questioning how much they really owe each other; they're left with the ancient consolation of one another's company and help. We watch this egotistic circle forge its single greatest masterwork: a healthy community.The novel, a sort of disco requiem-mass, divides itself into three symphonic movements: \"Before,\" \"After,\" and \"After After.\" The work concludes in a homemade paradise that resembles Hartley Mims's own starter vision of all that seemed waiting--latent and convivial--in New York itself.This is a work that could've only been written now, in our age of medical advances, written about these unsuspecting unsung heroes of a medieval scourge's first endgame moves among us. Plays Well with Others becomes a hymn to the joys and woes of caretaking (for waning parents and young friends). Allan Gurganus has created a deeply engaging narrative about flawed, well-meaning people who seem lifted from our own address books. His book offers an obsessive love story, a complex vision of our recent past, and an emotional firestorm--a pandemic's long-awaited great novel.",

Now in her eightieth year, Agatha McGee finds herself feeling her age, more tired and less a part of daily life in town. The new parish priest, Father Healy (of North of Hope), isn't helping matters either, as he tries to wean her off her frequent Confessions, thinking Agatha has become a bit too zealous with morality.

        "Authors": "By Lukacs, John",
        "Description": "The days from May 24 to May 28, 1940 altered the course of the history of this century, as the members of the British War Cabinet debated whether to negotiate with Hitler or to continue what became known as the Second World War. The decisive importance of these five days is the focus of John Lukacs\u2019s magisterial new book.Lukacs takes us hour by hour into the critical unfolding of events at 10 Downing Street, where Churchill and the members of his cabinet were painfully considering their war responsibilities. We see how the military disasters taking place on the Continent\u2014particularly the plight of the nearly 400,000 British soldiers bottled up in Dunkirk\u2014affected Churchill\u2019s fragile political situation, for he had been prime minister only a fortnight and was regarded as impetuous and hotheaded even by many of his own party. Lukacs also investigates the mood of the British people, drawing on newspaper and Mass-Observation reports that show how the citizenry, though only partly informed about the dangers that faced them, nevertheless began to support Churchill\u2019s determination to stand fast.Other historians have dealt with Churchill\u2019s difficulties during this period, using the partial revelations of certain memoirs and private and public papers. But Lukacs is the first to convey the drama and importance of these days, and he does so in a compelling narrative that combines deep knowledge with high literary style.",

        "Description": "With a growing readership that is outpacing that of all other political columnists, Cal Thomas now turns his attention to the tragic consequences of misguided liberal thinking, laying out a damning indictment that will surely provoke a lively national debate.The Things That Matter Most is for people who wonder why social problems don't seem to go away, no matter how much money we pour into them...who think that families do matter, that fidelity does count, that fighting for one's country is noble...who long for a sense of purpose more transcendent than collecting another paycheck.With an objective, analytic eye, Thomas traces our current national malaise - rampant disease, crime, and despair - to the false promises of the sixties. Ironically, by topping all traditions; by declaring drugs and sex \"in\" and God \"out\"; by promulgating a credo of \"it feels good, do it,\" the activists of that era triggered a process that produced the following: a widespread erosion of standards - most alarmingly in the area of education; a \"can you top this\" race to fill the media with ever cruder content; an explosive rise in sexual promiscuity and drug taking, leading to epidemic disease; the increasing rarity of the society-strengthening two-parent family; a spiritual vacuum that causes people to question why life is worth living; and a \"Welfare Pentagon\" whose enfeebling mantra is \"you can't do it alone.\"Mixing hard truths with wry commentary, Cal Thomas prescribes a new vision for America that begins with reconsidering the values by which our parents and grandparents lived. America may have lost its way, but it can regain it, Thomas argues - in what will surely be one of the most important and talked-about books of the year.",

        "Title": "Standing Firm: Dan Quayle",
        "Authors": "By Quayle, Dan",
        "Description": "Standing Firm leaves no doubt that Dan Quayle is the most misjudged figure in modern political history. Prior to 1988, Quayle had never lost an election. Not for Congress. Not even for the Senate. Heading into that year's Republican Convention, Quayle was considered one of the party's brightest young stars - a man of unusual political instincts who, when it came to campaigning, had a reputation as a giant killer. He would become the first in his generation to hold national office, but only after a tumultuous contest that frequently put him on the defensive.With gritty honesty and admirable self-deprecation, Quayle describes what it was like to weather that 1988 media storm, and the other squalls that followed. Poignantly, he also talks of the self-confidence and Christian faith that gave him the courage to stand firm and record some of the most noteworthy contributions of any Vice President ever. Among the high points: his coordination of America's response to a coup attempt in the Philippines, the details of which have never been reported; his bringing the family-values issue to the fore with the Murphy Brown speech - a call for action that, one year later, would even draw support from Democratic President Bill Clinton; his use of the White House Competitiveness Council to curtail harmful \"overregulation\"; his unreported diplomacy with Latin American leaders; and his championing of legal reform, which would earn him the strongest praise of his vice-presidency.Quayle pulls no punches when it comes to assessing himself and other players in the Bush administration - the men and women who were his allies, and sometimes his opponents, in helping George Bush spread democracy around the world. He shares entries from his diary of the Persian Gulf crisis, offers a surprising snapshot of what the typical Bush cabinet meeting was like, describes intramural battles waged by White House power brokers, and reveals his special relationship with the President. Quayle, a former journalist, interviewed several members of the press for this book, and their contributions form a vital part of its fabric.Standing Firm is perhaps most intriguing in its analysis of what went wrong in the 1992 election. Quayle does not hesitate to place blame where it is deserved - in fact, he reserves some of the strongest criticism for himself. Throughout, the portrait is that emerges of the former Vice President is that of a man whose good humor is exceeded only by a competence for which he has never been fully credited.",

The rescue of this swastika-tattooed hoodlum -- who may have brought the house down while building bombs -- becomes a validation of all things American and true, and Sonny is immediately hailed as a national hero. But Ian's continued presence in Sonny's life creates a new set of hurdles for young Paul -- and his mother and his hometown -- to overcome.",

        "Title": "A Visionary Nation: Four Centuries of American Dreams and What Lies Ahead",
        "Authors": "By Karabell, Zachary",
        "Description": "America is a nation based on an idea. For nearly four centuries, Americans have shared the conviction that a perfect world is within reach. Running through our history is the presumption that we can have it all.In A Visionary Nation, Zachary Karabell shows how this utopian impulse forms a continuous thread in the tapestry of the American experience and represents who we really are. In this penetrating volume, he brings the core of American history to life by examining its successive stages, each promising utopia and none delivering it. Karabell reveals that during every stage, there have been men and women who strove to transform the world. These are the visionaries who have defined American culture. Part history, part essay, part prediction, this profoundly original work tells the stories of visionaries past and present, from Anne Hutchinson to FDR, Alexander Hamilton to Bill Gates. It shows that if our history has proven one thing, it is that no era lasts forever. In striving for the ideal, we have achieved much, but never have realized our dreams of spiritual fulfillment and material prosperity. And so we are chronically plagued by disappointment that we have not achieved everything.Along with this distinctive view of American history, Karabell offers his own vision of where our nation is heading. Just as the Puritan vision of a City on a Hill was supplanted by the Founding Fathers' vision of individuality, and just as the expansive vision of a government-led Great Society was eclipsed by the New Economy in the 1990s, so too will the New Economy be replaced in our near future by a period when community and spirituality will occupy center stage. Provocative, intelligent, and deeply engaging, A Visionary Nation provides a framework for understanding America's past while preparing us for the next phase of the nation's growth.",

Yet for Katharine's sixteen-year-old son, Michael, the sudden move is jarring. It's the last thing he needs while struggling with the still painful death of his father.And here, beyond the sparkling beaches, masked by the deceptive beauty of the rainforest, a terrible danger waits.It begins with a video transmission so shocking that Katharine cannot believe what flashes on her computer screen - then instantly, inexplicably, vanishes. Secret deliveries in the dead of the night to a restricted wing of the high-tech laboratory in which she works signal that behind locked doors some sinister experiment is unfolding.And then, with the sudden, unexplained death of Michael's friend, a disturbing truth dawns: the corporation that is funding Katharine's dig has a far greater investment than she has imagined - an investment in medical terror. And her son may be part of their hideous grand plan.",

        "Title": "The Good Fat Cookbook",
        "Authors": "By Sears, Barry and McCullough, Fran",
        "Description": "Good news. The good fats -- butter, chocolate, eggs, coconut, olive oil, avocado, fish and shellfish, among many other favorites -- are not only delicious, they're good for your brain, heart, immune system, hormones, skin, memory, and emotional well-being.   Whatever you think you know about fat, forget it. After two decades of the low-fat diet trend, Americans are fatter -- and less healthy -- than ever before. For many, those torturous no-fat, low-fat diets are outright health hazards, contributing to everything from premature wrinkling and depression to hormone dysfunction and even cancer.  In The Good Fat Cookbook, best-selling author Fran McCullough delivers the delicious news. Here is powerful evidence that not only have we been sold a bill of low-fat goods, but the foods we love to eat -- real butter, chocolate, coconut, whole milk and cream, nuts, avocados, cold-water fish, red meat, olive oil, bacon and eggs -- are actually good for us.  Not only does fat not make you fat, the good fats slow the effects of aging, improve mood and memory, boost the immune system, and protect against catastrophic disease such as stroke and cancer. And the most surprising news of all: the right fats are great tools for weight loss -- they make you fuller faster and for longer and jump-start your metabolism.  McCullough debunks fat myths and demystifies cutting-edge science, while exploring all aspects of the fat phenomenon, fork in hand. More than a hundred simple recipes -- Salmon Chowder, Tuna with Rice, Deep-Fried Coconut Shrimp, Parsley Salad with Avocado, Chicken with Olives and Oranges, Grilled Cheese with Oregano, Crisp Coconut Waffles, Avocado Cheesecake, and Wall-to-Wall Walnut Brownies -- put the good fats back on your table, and McCullough offers spirited advice on everything from the best cooking oils and tastiest canned tuna to nutritional supplements and testing for your fatty-acid profile. Her hundreds of thousands of low-carb fans will be overjoyed to see that most of the recipes here are perfect for them as well.  Fran McCullough is the author of the best-selling The Low-Carb Cookbook and Living Low-Carb. She won a James Beard Award for Great Food Without Fuss and, since 1999, has been the editor of the annual Best American Recipes anthology series. A graduate of Stanford University, McCullough began her career as an editor, discovering Sylvia Plath, Pulitzer Prize winner N. Scott Momaday, and National Book Award winner Robert Bly as well as Richard Ford. She also edited and published a distinguished list of cookbook authors, including Diana Kennedy, Paula Wolfert, and Deborah Madison. Her website address is www.blackdirt.net/lowcarb",

        "Description": "Recently rediscovered by art historians, and one of the few female post-Renaissance painters to achieve fame during her own era, Artemisia Gentileschi led a remarkably \"modern\" life. Susan Vreeland tells Artemisia's captivating story, beginning with her public humiliation in a rape trial at the age of eighteen, and continuing through her father's betrayal, her marriage of convenience, motherhood, and growing fame as an artist. Set against the glorious backdrops of Rome, Florence, Genoa, and Naples, inhabited by historical characters such as Galileo and Cosimo de' Medici II, and filled with rich details about life as a seventeenth-century painter, Vreeland creates an inspiring story about one woman's lifelong struggle to reconcile career and family, passion and genius.",
