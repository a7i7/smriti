        "Title": "Leaving Cecil Street",
        "Authors": "By McKinney-Whetstone, Diane",
        "Description": ". . . though the block had long ago made the transition from white to colored to Negro to Black Is Beautiful, the city still provided street cleaning . . . when the children took to the outside and there was the familiar smack, smack of the double-Dutch rope. The sound was a predictable comfort. Like the sounds of the Corner Boys, a mildly delinquent lot consumed with pilfering Kool cigarettes or the feel of a virgin girl's behind. . . . As she did in her previous novels Tumbling and Blues Dancing, Diane McKinney-Whetstone once again masterfully renders time and place, character and emotional intensities. It is 1969 and Cecil Street is \"feeling some kind of way,\" so the residents decide to have two block parties this year. These energetic, sensual street celebrations serve as backdrops to the stories of the people on the block. Joe, a long-ago sax player, has turned his eye across the street to a newly arrived young southern beauty even as he is suddenly haunted by memories of his horn-playing nights and his affection for a shy, soft hooker from years ago. Joe's wife, Louise, a licensed practical nurse, is losing her teeth to gum disease and her joy to sensing that Joe's attention has wandered. Their teenage daughter, Shay, is consumed with helping her best friend and next-door neighbor Neet, who has gotten pregnant by a Corner Boy. Neet's mother, Alberta, is shunned by the block because of her immersion in a religion that has no name. As the novel opens, the first block party has ended and a naked woman has secretly taken up residence in Joe and Louise's cellar.McKinney-Whetstone's superb gift for  language and storytelling, for crafting scenes that leave the reader breathless, for distilling complex human emotion in a well-turned phrase, is on full display here. She portrays the community and the times with precision and compassion in an unforgettable story that gets under the skin. As the novel builds to the second block party, the past becomes as immediate as the present, condemnable acts become righteous, and what is tragic is also filled with hope.  This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",

        "Description": "John McEnroe was just an eighteen-year-old amateur from Queens when he stunned the tennis world by making it to the Wimbledon semifinals in 1977. He turned pro the following year after winning the NCAA singles title; three years later, he was ranked number one in the world. McEnroe dominated tennis in the eighties, winning three Wimbledon and four U.S. Open titles. His 1980 Wimbledon final match with Bjorn Borg is considered by many tennis experts to be the best match ever.  You Cannot Be Serious is McEnroe at his most personal, a no-holds-barred examination of contemporary tennis, his championship seasons, his cantankerous on-court behavior, his marriage to Tatum O'Neal, his current roles as a devoted father, husband to pop star Patty Smyth, senior tennis tour player, and controversial television commentator, and much more.  Funny, biting, close to the bone, this is exactly the book you'd expect-and want-from one of the most colorful figures of our time.",

Today's parents often feel that they have too little time in their busy schedules to handle such an important task.  They're not even sure where to begin. In 20 Teachable Virtues authors Barbara C. Unell and Jerry L. Wyckoff, Ph.D. demonstrate the simple ways that you can teach your children to care about others and about themselves.   By using everyday time together, however brief, you can pass on the lessons of virtue that are most important to your familytoday and for generations to come.At a time when values seem to be on the decline and children are looking to their parents for guidance, this new book argues that the building of a more moral society begins in the home. Through numerous anecdotes and examples, Unell and Wyckoff show parents how a select group of 20 virtues can be instilled, and warn how easily kids can be sent the wrong message.\"To learn to live in society,\" write the authors, \"all children must learn to balance their personal wants against the needs of the social group (family, neighborhood, school, society). Today we see far too few examples of this kind of balance as people put their own wants and needs above all othersall of the time.\" Through the use of numerous anecdotes which illustrate each virtue, 20 Teachable Virtues shows how common occurrences can become \"teachable moments\".",

        "Description": "WHAT COMES AFTER THE MOMENT THAT FOREVER CHANGES YOUR LIFE?  This is the question that haunts Julia Bechtel, Noah Prine, and Kim Colella, the only survivors of a terrible boating accident off the coast of Maine that claimed the lives of nine other people.  Julia, a forty-year-old wife and mother, has always taken the path of least resistance. Pigeonholed by her controlling family and increasingly distant husband as \"loyal\" and \"obedient,\" she realizes in the aftermath of her brush with death that there is more to her -- and to the world around her -- than she ever imagined.  Feeling strangely connected to Noah, the divorced, brooding lobsterman who helped save her life, and to Kim, a twenty-one-year-old whose role in the accident and subsequent muteness are a mystery, Julia begins to explore the unique possibilities offered by the quiet island of Big Sawyer, Maine. Suddenly, things that once seemed critical lose significance, and things that seemed inconsequential take on a whole new importance. With each passing moment, each new discovery, Julia grows more sure that after coming face-to-face with death, she must have more from life.   Resolving to make things right for the future and drawing on an inner strength she never knew she possessed, Julia passionately awakens to a new world, fearlessly embracing uncertainties in a way she couldn't have imagined only a few weeks ago.  Set in a beautifully rendered island off the coast of Maine, where lobstermen leave with the tides each morning to haul and reset their traps, and neighbors gather each night to feast on the catch of the day, Barbara Delinsky's The Summer I Dared is a deeply moving story of the risky but rewarding search for self, a story of survival, and of the irrepressible ability of the human spirit to rebound from disaster and to create life anew.",

Already a hero to conservatives, Reagan reached out to moderates when he announced his candidacy for governor in 1966, in a speech that called for reform of the state's tax system and restoration of the California dream. \"Our problems are many but our capacity for solving them is limitless,\" Reagan said.",

        "Authors": "By Kristol, William and Kaplan, Lawrence",
        "Description": "As the crisis with Iraq continues, Americans have questions. Is war really necessary? What can it accomplish? What broad vision of U.S. foreign policy underlies the determination to remove Saddam Hussein? What were the failures of the last couple of decades that brought us to a showdown with a dictator developing weapons of mass destruction? What is the relationship between war with Iraq and the events of 9-11? The answers to these questions are found in this timely book by two of America's leading foreign policy thinkers. Kristol and Kaplan lay out a detailed rationale for action against Iraq. But to understand why we must fight Saddam, the authors assert, it is necessary to go beyond the details of his weapons of mass destruction, his past genocidal actions against Iran and his own people, and the U.N. resolutions he has ignored. The explanation begins with how the dominant policy ideas of the last decade--Clintonian liberalism and Republican realpolitik--led American policymakers to turn a blind eye to the threat Iraq has posed for well over a decade. As Kristol and Kaplan make clear, the war over Iraq is in large part a war of competing ideas about America's role in the world. The authors provide the first comprehensive explanation of the strategy of \"preemption\" guiding the Bush Administration in dealing with this crisis.

But it will be the beginning of a new era in American foreign policy. William Kristol and Lawrence Kaplan are indispensable guides to the era that lies ahead.",

He has lived grandly and ferociously - and much beyond his means. His close friend Chick has suggested that he put forth a book of his convictions about the ideas which sustain humankind, or kill it, and much to Ravelstein's surprise he does and becomes a millionaire. Ravelstein suggests in turn that Chick write a memoir or life of him, and during the course of a celebratory trip to Paris the two share thoughts on mortality, philosophy and history, loves and friends, old and new, and vaudeville routines from the remote past. The mood turns more somber once they have returned to the Midwest and Ravelstein succumbs to AIDS, and as Chick himself nearly dies.",

In place of the genial polymath, self-improver, and quintessential American, Gordon S. Wood reveals a figure much more ambiguous and complex\u2014and much more interesting. Charting the passage of Franklin\u2019s life and reputation from relative popular indifference (his death, while the occasion for mass mourning in France, was widely ignored in America) to posthumous glory, The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin sheds invaluable light on the emergence of our country\u2019s idea of itself.",

And then Innocent walks in, sits down beside her, and turns her on her head. A dashing, well-heeled investment banker originally from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, West Africa, Innocent seems interested in her ... but he's one of them.Before meeting him, Noire shunned the \"bourgie\" world of black monied cosmopolitans like Innocent, opting instead for socially conscious -- but economically challenged -- artists and urban intellectuals. Their mutual attraction blossoms into lust and eventually love, but it lives in the shifting sands of personal beliefs and professional ambitions that are often at odds.Set in present-day New York City with jaunts to Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean, A Love Noire is the story of an unlikely couple that struggles to discover whether their passion will keep them together, or if their differences will tear them apart. Stripped to their barest selves, Innocent and Noire transcend all they've known to learn the redemptive power of love.A Love Noire offers an insider's look at color and class struggles, urban living, life in Africa, the notoriously unpredictable and heady New York dating scene, and good old-fashioned love. A natural and potent storyteller, Ms. Turnipseed writes of love and family with grace, and A Love Noire, her debut, marks the arrival of a resonant, sparkling voice in contemporary fiction.",

        "Title": "The Interior Castle: The Art and Life of Jean Stafford",
        "Authors": "By Hulbert, Ann",
        "Description": "An important moment in American literary history takes life in this stunning biography of Jean Stafford, one of the most successful, admired--and troubled--of the brilliant and influential midcentury circle of writers and critics that included Allen Tate, Caroline Gordon, Peter Taylor, Delmore Schwartz, Randall Jarrell, and Robert Lowell, Stafford's first husband.Ann Hulbert shows us how Stafford, raised in Colorado, the daughter of a failed writer of Westerns, came of literary age in the East, yet fiercely maintained her connection with her provincial background, forging the unique style that marked her highly acclaimed first novel, Boston Adventure; her Masterpiece, The Mountain Lion; her third novel, The Catherine Wheel; and the stories she published in The New Yorker and elsewhere, which were honored in 1970 with a Pulitzer Prize.We follow Stafford through the early experiences to which she returned again and again in her fiction, and which helped shape her disenchanted vision--her father's sudden loss of his fortune; her shame as an adolescent, living in a boardinghouse in Boulder run by her mother; her aesthetic experimentation as a member of the intellectually maverick \"Barbarians\" at the University of Colorado; her exciting but troubling Wanderjahr in Nazi Germany, where she watched civilization crumbling. We see her take her place as a forceful, attractive, witty, yet also insecure woman among a group of spirited young writers who were learning from and challenging their older mentors--the increasingly powerful Southern critics and the Partisan Review circle in New York.With her marriage to Lowell at twenty-four, she embarked on a feverishly creative but ill-fated course that held auguries of his and his fellow poets' tragic paths: she struggled with Catholicism, confronted domestic violence, battled with alcoholism and mental instability, and throughout it all wrote formally impeccable fiction. And we see her as she finds some happiness with her third husband, the writer A. J. Liebling, part of the New Yorker world that had become her home in the late 1940s.Throughout, we are made aware of Stafford's constant search for a bastion of order--a safe place, an escape from the unsettling sense of vulnerability that engulfed her, an interior castle--from which to approach her life and her art.",

Patricia is alone with this exquisite painting in a remote Irish cottage by the sea. How she arrived in such an unlikely circumstance is one part of the story Patricia tells us: about her father, a policeman who raised her to believe deeply in the cause of a united Ireland; the art history career that has sustained her since the numbing loss of her daughter; and the arrival of Mickey O'Driscoll, her dangerously charming, young Irish cousin, which has led to her involvement in this high-stakes crime.How her sublime vigil becomes a tale of loss, regret, and transformation is the rest of her story. As Patricia immerses herself in the turbulent passions of her Irish heritage and ponders her aesthetic fidelity to the serene and understated pleasures of Dutch art, she discovers, in her silent communion, a growing awareness of all that has been hidden beneath the surface of her own life. And she discovers that she possesses the knowledge of what she must do to preserve the things she values most.",

We meet the people who most influenced Goodwin\u2019s early life: her mother, who taught her the joy of books but whose debilitating illness left her housebound: and her father, who taught her the joy of baseball and to root for the Dodgers of Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, and Gil Hodges. Most important, Goodwin describes with eloquence how the Dodgers\u2019 leaving Brooklyn in 1957, and the death of her mother soon after, marked both the end of an era and, for her, the end of childhood.",

        "Authors": "By Safire, William and Bendis, Keith (ILT)",
        "Description": "There are connoisseurs. There are virtuosos. And then there are mavens. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer William Safire is the maven's maven. In this new collection from his New York Times Magazine column, \"On Language,\" Safire - using alliteration, puns, and other tricks of the writer's trade - offers a cornucopia of words, phrases, slang, and grammatical oddities, proving once again why Time calls him \"the country's best practitioner of the art of columny.\"Safire probes the surprising origins of such expressions as \"kiss and tell,\" \"people of color,\" \"stab in the back,\" \"bonfire of the vanities,\" and the whole nine yards. He attempts to explain what a White House press secretary meant when he announced, \"We can't winkle-picker this anymore.\" He even explores tricky new usages of the word \"fax.\" Quoth the maven: \"In work conducted at home or at the office, the only certainties are death and faxes.\"Was George Bush (or speechwriter Peggy Noonan) the first to put \"kinder and gentler\" together? No, quoth the maven, who calls attention to similar incantations by Clarence Darrow, Mario Cuomo, and William Shakespeare. Safire also traces the evolution of \"read my lips\" and exposes the proud (or embarrassed) coiners of such terms as \"lunatic fringe\" and \"nattering nabobs of negativism\" (his own creation, he admits - an update of Adlai Stevenson's \"prophets of doom and gloom\").Never one to shrink from a challenge, the maven boldly seeks a source for George Bush's inexplicable expression \"like ugly on an ape.\" The best he can find is Margaret Mitchell's \"ugly like a hairless monkey\" in Gone with the Wind. Fortunately, Safire is not alone in such lexicographic quests. A faithful corps of would-be mavens - including Cuomo, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Phyllis Schlafly, and Alistair Cooke - supply Safire with their own research and opinions.Knowledgeable, witty, and impeccably grammatical, William Safire's essays on language are an important and entertaining reference for mavens everywhere.",

        "Description": "Laura Bush is arguably the most popular figure in the Bush White House. Even the President's detractors would not hesitate to describe the First Lady as utterly sincere and devoted to family and country, whether she is advocating on behalf of education and libraries or comforting the nation in times of crisis.  Ann Gerhart of The Washington Post has covered Mrs. Bush since 2001, and no other reporter has interviewed the First Lady more often. Through this unparalleled access Gerhart has been able to uncover the woman behind the carefully maintained image. Far more than an uncomplicated maternal figure and dedicated wife, Laura Bush emerges as a complex and fascinating woman in her own right, who has composed a life of accomplishment for herself alongside her husband's tremendous ambitions.  The Perfect Wife tells the complete story from Mrs. Bush's upbringing to her whirlwind three-month courtship by George W. Bush and her role as a mother, wife, and public figure. An only child raised in a segregated and fiercely traditional West Texas town, she is less conservative than her husband and appealingly down-to-earth despite the extraordinary privileges of her position. Two tragedies have defined her: a car accident when she was seventeen and September 11, when she suddenly had to transform her job and take herself far more seriously. Ann Gerhart examines the First Lady's influences and motivations, reveals the depths to which her husband relies upon her, and assesses her achievements. Compelling and insightful, this is the first comprehensive account of a woman who has won the admiration of the nation and of the compromises and challenges that come with taking on the most examined volunteer job in the world.

        "Description": "Some students of the presidency say that we can learn the most about the men who've occupied the Oval Office by studying their ideology. Others say political savvy or family background or regional influences are paramount. But Don Van Natta argues for another standard?by observing the way they play golf.  Fourteen of the last seventeen presidents have been golfers, and Van Natta explores two questions: Why is the game of golf so attractive to the men who occupy the Oval Office? And what do their golf games reveal about their characters? Some presidents relied on golf to escape the burdens of office, while others brought those burdens with them. And few have been able to resist the perks of high office, bending the rules and freely taking mulligans. Is it really surprising to learn that the section called \"Hail to the Cheats\" features the golfing escapades of Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, and Warren Harding?  Not content to rely solely on the history books, Van Natta takes the reader on a round of golf he recently played with Bill Clinton and draws on extensive interviews with the golfing ex-presidents about what the game means to them. For history buffs and golf aficionados alike, First Off the Tee is a cheerful romp and a unique way to share the links with America's duffers-in-chief.",

Beginning in the Golden Era of Hollywood, the beautiful and talented actress Laura Marlowe meets the young, dashing, and rich shipping magnate Nicholas Stephanopolis.

A notorious thief. Cunning cops. And a troubled Irish history.  In the annals of fine art theft, no case has matched?for sheer criminal panache?the heist at Russborough in 1986. The Irish police knew right away that the mastermind was a brazen Dublin gangster named Martin Cahill. Yet the great plunder?including a Goya and a Vermeer?remained at large for years until the challenge of disposing of such famous works forced Cahill to reach outside the mob and into the international arena. When he did, his pursuers were waiting.  With the storytelling skill of a novelist and the nose of a detective, Matthew Hart follows the twists and turns of this celebrated case.  ?For those who might associate museums and lofty works of art with elitism and stuffiness, Hart reveals a far more compelling world filled with desperation and betrayal.? ?Nick Owchar, The Los Angeles Times  ?What makes this book so enjoyable is the author's deftness and restraint with what was a big splashy story.? ?Katherine Powers, The Boston Globe",

        "Description": "Denene Millner and Nick Chiles made waves with Love Don't Live Here Anymore, their debut novel hailed by critics for its \"insightful look at modern marriage\" (Publisher's Weekly) and its \"humor, compassion and honesty\" (Booklist).  In Love and War takes us into the lives of Zaria Chance, sister of Mikki Chance-Murphy, the female protagonist of Love Don't Live Here Anymore, and Kenneth Roman, a teacher and basketball coach. When Zaria walks into Kenneth's classroom to discuss her son's unruly behavior, there is instant conflict as these two strong personalities go head-to-head-but there is also a powerful physical attraction. Though they see the world in completely different ways, it soon becomes clear they can't live without each other. But when Kenneth gets caught in a colossal lie, Zaria must decide whether she can overcome her pain and outrage to take him back.  Told in alternating viewpoints, this warm-hearted, sensual novel gives us an intimate perspective on each of the main characters' thoughts and feelings-the suspicions of the single mom and the panic of the wary bachelor. Peopled by a cast of complex and appealing characters drawn from real life and imbued with the candor, compassion, and humor that made their first novel a success, this Millner-Chiles tale is for anyone who has ever loved, lusted, and struggled to make a relationship work in the face of irrepressible drama and intense emotional baggage.",
