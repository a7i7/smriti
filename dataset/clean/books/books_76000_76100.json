Ranging from Medeato Thelma and Louise and from myths of cannibalism to the politics of rape, Six Myths of Our Time is at once a celebration of the enduring power of fable and a welcome antidote to its more virulent manifestations in our public life.",

Five years after his death from a rare   neuromuscular disease, Mattie is still being celebrated for his indomitable spirit and message of hope. Now the world   will get to know the full story of the poet, the peacemaker, the philosopher, and New York Times bestselling author in   the first book to share all of the intimate details of his incredible life. In Messenger, Mattie's   mother, Jeni Stepanek, recounts the years before Mattie got sick; how he handled the loss of his siblings from the   same disease he had; his decision to spread the message of peace and hope; and how, when he became a celebrity,   Jeni helped to keep him grounded, and remember to embrace being a kid. Including never-before- seen poems,   journal entries, photos, and correspondence with famous friends, Messenger is an inspirational book about a   life lived to the fullest. \"Not a day goes by when I don't receive e-mails and letters saying that Mattie's   poetry and speeches are not enough-people want to know about him directly and intimately. I am thrilled to have   joined with Dutton so that I can now tell all his fans the full story behind my son.\" - Jeni Stepanek,Good   Morning America.",

        "Title": "Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words That Re-Made America",
        "Authors": "By Wills, Garry",
        "Description": "The power of words has rarely been given a more compelling demonstration than in the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation \"a new birth of freedom\"--by tracing its first birth to the Declaration of Independence (which called all men equal) rather than to the Constitution (which tolerated slavery). In the space of a mere 272 words, Lincoln brought to bear the rhetoric of the Greek Revival, the categories of Transcendentalism, and the imagery of the \"rural cemetery\" movement. His entire life and previous training, his deep political experience, went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece.As Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel has been restored to its bold colors and forgotten details, Garry Wills restores the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln at Gettysburg combines the same extraordinary quality of observation that defines Wills's previous best-selling portraits of modern presidents, such as Reagan's America and Nixon Agonistes, with the iconoclastic scholarship of his studies of our founding documents, such as Inventing America. By examining both the Address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew and reveals much about a President so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world, to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns.The Civil War is, to most Americans, what Lincoln wanted it to mean. Now Garry Wills explains how Lincoln wove a spell that has not, yet, been broken.",

        "Description": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt proclaimed it \"A day that will live in infamy\"-December 7, 1941, the one date from the Second World War that almost every American knows by heart. Pearl Harbor is the definitive illustrated account of that momentous day. No other battle of the Pacific War was better documented in photographs than was Pearl Harbor. Everyone has seen some of these images, but few are aware of just how many there are-including many that have never been published. Official government photographers were busy that morning, but so were countless service personnel and shocked civilians. Even the Japanese navy photographed their preparations and the launch of the attack fleet. The visual record of the day includes not just stunning black-and-white shots but also vivid color photos showing the American fleet under attack and burning. Pearl Harbor makes lavish use of these historical photos to vividly re-create what it felt like to be there during every key moment of the battle. A compelling narrative by noted naval historian Dan Van der Vat explains the causes and background of the attack. Moving first-person reminiscences of persons who were there-Japanese and Americans, military and civilians, adults and children-give the pictures even greater immediacy.",

        "Title": "Confronting The Controversies: A Christian Looks at the Tough Issues",
        "Authors": "By Hamilton, Adam",
        "Description": "Christians are faced every day with daunting choices between difficult alternatives. What does my Christian faith have to say about the moral issues that divide our society? There are plenty of people on opposite sides of the spectrum claiming to know the will of God in these matters. It is nonetheless very difficult to find help in looking at both sides of these ethical questions and applying the biblical witness to arrive at an authentically Christian belief about them. This is precisely what Adam Hamilton proposes to do. Presented as a collection of sermons, Confronting the Controversies includes euthanasia, assisted suicide, creationism, abortion, and homosexuality. Scrupulously fair to both the positions of each side and their motivations for holding them, Hamilton offers clear, concise information on what is at stake in these explosive issues. Hamilton applies a careful, broad reading of Scripture to offer direct yet compassionate guidance on what a faithful Christian response will be. This book is set up for group study, with discussion questions at the end of each chapter.",

        "Title": "The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American Century",
        "Authors": "By Brinkley, Alan",
        "Description": "Acclaimed historian Alan Brinkley gives us a sharply realized portrait of Henry Luce, arguably the most important publisher of the twentieth century.As the founder of Time, Fortune, and Life magazines, Luce changed the way we consume news and the way we understand our world. Born the son of missionaries, Henry Luce spent his childhood in rural China, yet he glimpsed a milieu of power altogether different at Hotchkiss and later at Yale. While working at a Baltimore newspaper, he and Brit Hadden conceived the idea of Time: a \u201cnews-magazine\u201d that would condense the week\u2019s events in a format accessible to increasingly busy members of the middle class. They launched it in 1923, and young Luce quickly became a publishing titan. In 1936, after Time\u2019s unexpected success\u2014and Hadden\u2019s early death\u2014Luce published the first issue of Life, to which millions soon subscribed.Brinkley shows how Luce reinvented the magazine industry in just a decade. The appeal of Life seemingly cut across the lines of race, class, and gender. Luce himself wielded influence hitherto unknown among journalists. By the early 1940s, he had come to see his magazines as vehicles to advocate for America\u2019s involvement in the escalating international crisis, in the process popularizing the phrase \u201cWorld War II.\u201d In spite of Luce\u2019s great success, happiness eluded him. His second marriage\u2014to the glamorous playwright, politician, and diplomat Clare Boothe\u2014was a shambles. Luce spent his later years in isolation, consumed at times with conspiracy theories and peculiar vendettas. The Publisher tells a great American story of spectacular achievement\u2014yet it never loses sight of the public and private costs at which that achievement came.",

        "Title": "The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama",
        "Authors": "By Remnick, David",
        "Description": "No story has been more central to America\u2019s history this century than the rise of Barack Obama, and until now, no journalist or historian has written a book that fully investigates the circumstances and experiences of Obama\u2019s life or explores the ambition behind his rise. Those familiar with Obama\u2019s own best-selling memoir or his campaign speeches know the touchstones and details that he chooses to emphasize, but now\u2014from a writer whose gift for illuminating the historical significance of unfolding events is without peer\u2014we have a portrait, at once masterly and fresh, nuanced and unexpected, of a young man in search of himself, and of a rising politician determined to become the first African-American president.The Bridge offers the most complete account yet of Obama\u2019s tragic father, a brilliant economist who abandoned his family and ended his life as a beaten man; of his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, who had a child as a teenager and then built her career as an anthropologist living and studying in Indonesia; and of the succession of elite institutions that first exposed Obama to the social tensions and intellectual currents that would force him to imagine and fashion an identity for himself. Through extensive on-the-record interviews with friends and teachers, mentors and disparagers, family members and Obama himself, David Remnick allows us to see how a rootless, unaccomplished, and confused young man created himself first as a community organizer in Chicago, an experience that would not only shape his urge to work in politics but give him a home and a community, and that would propel him to Harvard Law School, where his sense of a greater mission emerged.Deftly setting Obama\u2019s political career against the galvanizing intersection of race and politics in Chicago\u2019s history, Remnick shows us how that city\u2019s complex racial legacy would make Obama\u2019s forays into politics a source of controversy and bare-knuckle tactics: his clashes with older black politicians in the Illinois State Senate, his disastrous decision to challenge the former Black Panther Bobby Rush for Congress in 2000, the sex scandals that would decimate his more experienced opponents in the 2004 Senate race, and the story\u2014from both sides\u2014of his confrontation with his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. By looking at Obama\u2019s political rise through the prism of our racial history, Remnick gives us the conflicting agendas of black politicians: the dilemmas of men like Jesse Jackson, John Lewis, and Joseph Lowery, heroes of the civil rights movement, who are forced to reassess old loyalties and understand the priorities of a new generation of African-American leaders.The Bridge revisits the American drama of race, from slavery to civil rights, and makes clear how Obama\u2019s quest is not just his own but is emblematic of a nation where destiny is defined by individuals keen to imagine a future that is different from the reality of their current lives.",

Ripped by her family from the man she loves, sixteen-year-old Serafina is sharp and defiant. Her first night inside the walls is spent in an incandescent rage so violent that the dispensary mistress, Suora Zuana, is dispatched to the girl\u2019s cell to sedate her. Thus begins a complex relationship of trust and betrayal. As Serafina rails against her incarceration, disorder and rebellion mount inside the convent, while beyond its walls, the dictates of the Counter-Reformation begin to impose a regime of oppression that threatens what little freedom the nuns have enjoyed. Acclaimed author Sarah Dunant brings the intricate Renaissance world compellingly to life in this rich, engrossing, multifaceted love story encompassing the passions of the flesh, the exultation of the spirit, and the deep, enduring power of friendship.",

From the physically and mentally taxing sport of chess boxing to the psychological battlefield that is the rock-paper-scissors championship, to the underground world of illegal jart throwing, to several competitions that involve nudity, Reilly, in his valiant quest, subjected himself to both bodily danger and abject humiliation (or, in the case of ferret legging, both).

It's debatable whether these sports push the body or just human idiocy to the outermost limits, but one thing is for sure: Sports in Hell is laugh-out-loud hilarious and will deliver plenty of unabashed fun.",

        "Description": "This \u201crichly textured biography\u201d (Chicago Tribune) inspired the mesmerizing documentary, Letters from Baghdad, soon to air on public television.Here is the story of Gertrude Bell, who explored, mapped, and excavated the Arab world throughout the early twentieth century. Recruited by British intelligence during World War I, she played a crucial role in obtaining the loyalty of Arab leaders, and her connections and information provided the brains to match T. E. Lawrence's brawn. After the war, she played a major role in creating the modern Middle East and was, at the time, considered the most powerful woman in the British Empire. \u00a0 In this masterful biography, Janet Wallach shows us the woman behind these achievements\u2013a woman whose passion and defiant independence were at odds with the confined and custom-bound England she left behind. Too long eclipsed by Lawrence, Gertrude Bell emerges at last in her own right as a vital player on the stage of modern history, and as a woman whose life was both a heartbreaking story and a grand adventure.",

Magazine articles ask the question, \"Who needs a man anyway?\" And your Bible study leader seems to imply that the day you give up on getting married, the man God intended for you will ask you out. Finding Mr. Right offers a different perspective.Authors Stephen Arterburn, M.Ed. and Meg J. Rinck, Ph.D. reject the idea that a woman looking for someone to marry is on a desperate, demeaning hunt. Neither do they believe that if a woman is simply patient, her one and only perfect mate will one day walk out of the mist and hand her a bouquet of flowers. Instead, they recognize that wanting to get married is a legitimate desire.Finding Mr. Right outlines steps you can take toward a strong, satisfying marriage relationship, including:Become the confident woman who can attract the kind of man you wantMake lifestyle choices that increase your odds of meeting someoneRecognize the qualities that make a man Mr. RightAvoid the behaviors that sabotage a good relationshipBuild a solid relationship with the right person",

Chimps named Milton, Swift, and Kafka are locked in a room and made to re-create Hamlet. And a con man peddles courses in a dubious language in which \"hello\" translates as \"velcro\" and \"fraud\" comes out as \"freud.\"At once enchanting and perplexing, incisively intelligent and side-splittingly funny, this original paperback edition of Ives's plays includes \"Sure Thing,\" \"Words, Words, Words,\" \"The Universal Language,\" \"Variations on the Death of Trotsky,\" \"The Philadelphia,\" \"Long Ago and Far Away,\" \"Foreplay, or The Art of the Fugue,\" \"Seven Menus,\" \"Mere Mortals,\" \"English Made Simple,\" \"A Singular Kinda Guy,\" \"Speed-the-Play,\" \"Ancient History,\" and \"Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread.\"",
