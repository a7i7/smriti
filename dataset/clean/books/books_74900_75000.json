        "Description": "The world stopped for America on September 11, 2001, the day of the worst terrorist attack ever on U.S. soil. It was also the day America showed its true colors. Firefighters, police officers, paramedics, and EMTs sped to the scene. Concerned more about others' safety than their own, they raced into the very buildings workers were fleeing from. Hundreds gave their lives so that others might live. Thousands of others put their lives at risk, day after day, working under dangerous conditions in the round-the-clock search for survivors. But the heroism sparked by the horrific events of that day does not stop there. It spans the country, indeed the globe, and Heroes tells the stories of the men, women, and children who stepped up to help. Most were ordinary citizens who saw what needed to be done and did it. Selfless concern for others links the fifty uplifting stories in these pages, stories of ordinary Americans who made heroic choices under the most terrifying circumstances and gave inspiration with their generosity and willingness to serve, stories that show definitively that the American spirit cannot be diminished but rather grows stronger and brighter in the face of adversity.",

In this intimate dual memoir, she and her daughter, Ann, offer distinct perspectives as a fifty-something and a twenty-something, each on a quest to redefine herself and to rediscover each other. Between 1998 and 2000, Sue and Ann travel throughout Greece and France. Sue, coming to grips with aging, caught in a creative vacuum, longing to reconnect with her grown daughter, struggles to enlarge a vision of swarming bees into a novel. Ann, just graduated from college, heartbroken and benumbed by the classic question about what to do with her life, grapples with a painful depression. As this modern-day Demeter and Persephone chronicle the richly symbolic and personal meaning of an array of inspiring figures and sites, they also each give voice to that most protean of connections: the bond of mother and daughter. A wise and involving book about feminine thresholds, spiritual growth, and renewal, Traveling with Pomegranates is both a revealing self-portrait by a beloved author and her daughter, a writer in the making, and a momentous story that will resonate with women everywhere.",

        "Authors": "By Schlessinger, Laura",
        "Description": "Dr. Laura Schlessinger agrees that there are things worth whining about! A certain amount of whining allows for some venting of reasonable pain, disappointment, fear, frustration, or frank rage. However, staying stuck in whining mode can become a life-long problem. This is where Dr. Laura steps in with Stop Whining, Start Living to help folks conquer the temptation to retreat from living life to the fullest.As she reveals in her introduction, \"No matter what you've suffered or continue to suffer, while you are alive you have the opportunity to get something from this life, and I'm going to do my best to help you with that. . . . I know of what I speak, as this has been my torturous journey also.\" Building on the principles developed during her long career as a licensed marriage and family therapist, and addressing the chronic struggles of so many of her listeners and readers, Dr. Laura issues an important message in the no-nonsense but compassionate voice that is her trademark: If you don't like your life, quit talking about your unhappiness and try to fix it, no matter how difficult or impossible your situation seems. While it is healthy to vent occasionally, endless rumination on the negative only keeps you paralyzed in misery, reinforces hopelessness, and demoralizes those around you who feel helpless to bring any happiness into your life. Instead, Stop Whining, Start Living encourages \"whiners\" to reject negative thoughts, emotions, and attitudes; shift perspective; open up to gratitude and goodness; and embrace obligations to loved ones and the world in general. Before long, just doing what you're supposed to be doing\u2014instead of moaning about why you can't or won't or shouldn't fulfill your responsibilities\u2014will have you feeling better about yourself and will uplift your interactions with family, friends, colleagues, and even complete strangers in incredible ways.Illustrated by calls and letters from members of Dr. Laura's huge international audience, Stop Whining, Start Living features brave testimonials from real human beings facing real challenges. These folks have benefited enormously from Dr. Laura's powerful lessons.Stop Whining, Start Living gives readers stuck in their suffering the jump start they need to break out of reactive mode and get proactive, moving in the direction of a joyful, meaningful, happy, fulfilling, and purposeful future. Everyone can use a kick in the pants sometimes, and Dr. Laura, who \"preaches, teaches, and nags\" to millions every day on her radio program, is here to deliver it!",

        "Authors": "By Gardner, Howard",
        "Description": "Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner has been acclaimed as the most influential educational theorist since John Dewey. His ideas about intelligence and creativity - explicated in such bestselling books as Frames of Mind and Multiple Intelligences (over 200,000 copies in print combined) - have revolutionized our thinking.In his groundbreaking 1983 book Frames of Mind, Howard Gardner first introduced the theory of multiple intelligences, which posits that intelligence is more than a single property of the human mind. That theory has become widely accepted as one of the seminal ideas of the twentieth century and continues to attract attention all over the world.Now in Intelligence Reframed, Gardner provides a much-needed report on the theory, its evolution and revisions. He offers practical guidance on the educational uses of the theory and responds to the critiques leveled against him. He also introduces two new intelligences (existential intelligence and naturalist intelligence) and argues that the concept of intelligence should be broadened, but not so absurdly that it includes every human virtue and value. Ultimately, argues Gardner, possessing a basic set of seven or eight intelligences is not only a unique trademark of the human species, but also perhaps even a working definition of the species. Gardner also offers provocative ideas about creativity, leadership, and moral excellence, and speculates about the relationship between multiple intelligences and the world of work in the future.",

A strange sense stole over me, as though Bland and I were two actors on stage, our movements spotlighted, black emptiness between us. But that darkness grew smaller as the space between us shrank. I did not know if this sense was due to my immersion in Bland\u2019s face and mind and world, or to my fear of his threatening presence. Or both . . . The nerves between my shoulder blades began to tingle. Help me, God. Please. For twenty years, a killer has eluded capture for a brutal double murder. Now, forensic artist Annie Kingston has agreed to draw the updated face of Bill Bland for the popular television show American Fugitive. To do so, Annie must immerse herself in Bland\u2019s traits and personality. A single habitual expression could alter the way his face has aged. But as she descends into his criminal mind and world, someone is determined to stop her. At any cost. Annie\u2019s one hope is to complete the drawing and pray it leads authorities to Bland\u2014before Bland can get to her.

Pluralism and variety of thought are not avoidable compromises, but the glory of civilisation.

Podolak, contributing writer to Threads Magazine, is quite expert in breaking down the construction of the jacket. Organization of chapters is very logical, starting with selection of style, fabric, and customizing fit. There is an outstanding section on pressing and shaping fabric. The presentation throughout is crisp, and photos and diagrams are frequent and well placed. Likewise a contributor to Threads Magazine, Tilton follows the exact same format, with special sections and help tips unique to the garment. Both texts are polished, professional, and wonderfully written. This series compares favorably with \"Singer Sewing Reference Library\" series, which focuses on fabrics, fit, children's wear, etc. Taunton's new series is all garment-specific, and though the format is redundant, it works well.

Frontier House  America's period of westward expansion has long captured the imagination of history buffs and adventurous spirits; the era seems to embody the very daring enterprise that made America what it is today. As a result, frontier life has often been romanticized in television and film. But all of that changed with PBS's Frontier House.  Bringing the trials and triumphs of nineteenth-century homesteaders to life in a way we might never have imagined, Frontier House re-creates life in the wilderness for three households of spirited twenty-first-century Americans and documents their six-month experience for television.  Roughing it on their allotted plots of land while all of America watches, these brave souls relinquish grocery stores, microwaves, and plumbing in favor of raising chickens, churning butter, and outhouses. Gone are all the modern amenities they're accustomed to. In their place: just the will to do whatever it takes to survive.  Covering the inception of the show, the historical basis for the lifestyle re-created, the selection of the participants, the logistical challenges of production, and the impact of this experiment on the participants -- along with profiles of actual nineteenth-century homesteaders -- Frontier House is a first-rate companion to one of the most innovative and fascinating reality shows of our time.",

The Invention of Air is a book of world-changing ideas wrapped around a compelling narrative, a story of   genius and violence and friendship in the midst of sweeping historical change that provokes us to recast our   understanding of the Founding Fathers. It is the story of Joseph Priestley\u2014scientist and theologian,   prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Benjamin Franklin, friend of Thomas Jefferson\u2014an eighteenth-century radical thinker who played pivotal   roles in the invention of ecosystem science, the discovery of oxygen, the founding of the Unitarian Church, and the   intellectual development of the United States. And it is a story that only Steven Johnson, acclaimed juggler of   disciplines and provocative ideas, can do justice to. In the 1780s, Priestley had established himself in his   native England as a brilliant scientist, a prominent minister, and an outspoken advocate of the American Revolution,   who had sustained long correspondences with Franklin, Jefferson, and John Adams. Ultimately, his radicalism made   his life politically uncomfortable, and he fled to the nascent United States. Here, he was able to build conceptual   bridges linking the scientific, political, and religious impulses that governed his life. And through his close   relationships with the Founding Fathers\u2014Jefferson credited Priestley as the man who prevented him from   abandoning Christianity\u2014he exerted profound if little-known influence on the shape and course of our   history. As in his last bestselling work, The Ghost Map, Steven Johnson here uses a dramatic   historical story to explore themes that have long engaged him: innovation and the way new ideas emerge and   spread, and the environments that foster these breakthroughs. And as he did in Everything Bad Is Good for   You, Johnson upsets some fundamental assumptions about the world we live in\u2014namely, what it means when   we invoke the Founding Fathers\u2014and replaces them with a clear-eyed, eloquent assessment of where we stand   today.",

        "Description": "For the past three decades, the federal government has targeted the poorest areas of American cities with a succession of antipoverty initiatives, yet these urban neighborhoods continue to decline. According to David Rusk, focusing on programs aimed at improving inner-city neighborhoods--playing the \"inside game\"--is a losing strategy. Achieving real improvement requires matching the \"inside game\" with a strong \"outside game\" of regional strategies to overcome growing fiscal disparities, concentrated poverty, and urban sprawl.    In this persuasive book filled with personal observations as well as his trademark mastery of census statistics, Rusk argues that state legislatures must set new \"rules of the game.\" He believes those rules require regional revenue or tax base sharing to reduce fiscal disparity, regional housing policies to ensure that all new developments have their fair share of low- and moderate-income housing to dissolve concentrations of poverty, and regional land-use planning and growth management to control urban sprawl.    State government action, Rusk argues, is particularly crucial where regions are highly fragmented by many competing city, village, and township governments. He provides vivid success stories that demonstrate best practices for these regional strategies along with recommendations for building effective regional coalitions.    A Century Foundation Book",

        "Authors": "By Lennick, Doug and Kiel, Fred",
        "Description": "Through a combination of research, and original thought leadership, the authors demonstrate how the best performing companies have leaders who actively apply moral values to achieve enduring personal and organizational success. These individuals exhibit moral intelligence: a strong moral compass and the ability to follow it. Lennick and Kiel reveal how dozens of companies benefit from the moral intelligence of their leaders, help build specific moral competencies leaders need: integrity, responsibility, compassion, forgiveness, and more. This book also includes the new Moral and Emotional Competency Inventory (MECI): an indispensable metric to assess moral intelligence. Leaders with strong moral intelligence can build the trust and commitment that are the foundation of truly great businesses. Be one of those leaders, lead one of those companies, with Moral Intelligence.",

        "Description": "Does having faith mean abandoning reason? It\u2019s easy to get that impression. Still, it seems reasonable that a supremely intelligent God would want you to use your God-given intellect on your spiritual journey as much as in any other aspect of your life. Faith may not stand on rational thinking alone, but a solid faith should walk hand in hand with intellectual integrity.Does it really matter what I believe? What is the relationship between faith and knowledge? Why are there so many religions? Do all paths lead to the same God? This book helps you sort through the questions, objections, and concerns you can\u2019t help but raise. A Search for What Makes Sense will help you think your way clearly and honestly to answers that satisfy because they\u2019re your answers\u2014conclusions you\u2019ve arrived at personally without manipulation, coercion, or game-playing.For faith to exist and grow it\u2019s got to make sense\u2014good sense, carefully-thought-out sense. And chances are it does.FINDING FAITHThe Finding Faith books A Search for What Makes Sense and A Search for What Is Real don\u2019t try to tell you what to believe; they are guides in learning how to believe. If you think the spiritual journey requires turning your back on honesty and intellectual integrity, these two companion volumes will speak to both your mind and your soul.",

        "Description": "Crow Lake is that rare find, a first novel so quietly assured, so emotionally pitch perfect, you know from the opening page that this is the real thing\u2014a literary experience in which to lose yourself, by an author of immense talent.Here is a gorgeous, slow-burning story set in the rural \u201cbadlands\u201d of northern Ontario, where heartbreak and hardship are mirrored in the landscape. For the farming Pye family, life is a Greek tragedy where the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons, and terrible events occur\u2014offstage. Centerstage are the Morrisons, whose tragedy looks more immediate if less brutal, but is, in reality, insidious and divisive. Orphaned young, Kate Morrison was her older brother Matt\u2019s protegee, her fascination for pond life fed by his passionate interest in the natural world. Now a zoologist, she can identify organisms under a microscope but seems blind to the state of her own emotional life. And she thinks she\u2019s outgrown her siblings\u2014Luke, Matt, and Bo\u2014who were once her entire world. In this universal drama of family love and misunderstandings, of resentments harbored and driven underground, Lawson ratchets up the tension with heartbreaking humor and consummate control, continually overturning one\u2019s expectations right to the very end. Tragic, funny, unforgettable, Crow Lake is a quiet tour de force that will catapult Mary Lawson to the forefront of fiction writers today.",

After the publication of Joan Wester Anderson's New York Times bestseller Where Angels Walk, people urged her to write a book entirely about children's experiences with angels--and sent along their own personal narratives as witness to these miraculous visitations.An Angel to Watch Over Me is the result: a wonderful collection of stories that documents and describes extraordinary encounters between children and celestial visions. There's the grandmotherly angel who consoles an ailing girl in a hospital emergency room, and the angel who helps a Texas boy lose his fear of thunderstorms. There are angels who combat darkness, bring glad tidings, and offer comfort. Angel prayers, mothers' memories, beautiful illustrations, and some heavenly hugs also grace these pages. For those who read this wondrous book, angels become a warm and loving presence in everyday life, a blessed part of being.\"A GEM FOR BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN...I love this book.\"--Antoinette Bosco\"MIRACULOUS...Poems, songs, and other angelic messages dot the text along with sweet drawings.\"--Booklist",

In An American Idea: The Making of the National Parks, Kim Heacox?winner of the Benjamin Franklin Nature Book Award, and twice winner of the Lowell Thomas Award for excellence in travel journalism?explores the development of our nation?s environmental consciousness. Heacox depicts the remarkable feats accomplished by dedicated people, from Lewis and Clark and Henry David Thoreau to John Muir and Teddy Roosevelt. Delving into original sources that date back to the 1600s, he pieces together an inspirational story peopled with such fascinating characters as young artist Thomas Moran, whose stunning landscapes of Yellowstone compelled Congress to deem it the first national park, and John Wesley Powell, the one-armed Civil War officer who first mapped the Grand Canyon. Enhanced by a portfolio of Ansel Adam?s photography, commissioned in the 1940s by the Department of the Interior to bring the beauty of the parklands to greater public awareness, An American Idea: The Making of the National Parks is a literary and visual treasure. Through compelling text enriched with stunning photographs, maps, and paintings?many of which have never been seen?this volume gives three centuries of American history an original and unexpected twist.",

In Imchouk, it was expected that Badra's life should be limited by her husband's wishes, but at Aunt Selma's, Badra begins to think about how she wants to live from now on. She recalls her youthful curiosity about sex ? what other girls' and women's bodies were like, her first attempts to spy on men, her fascination with the two beautiful prostitute sisters who lived outside Imchouk. When she develops a passionate, consuming relationship with a wealthy doctor, Badra remembers and rediscovers her own sexual being, in scenes that are erotic, revelatory, and sometimes bittersweet.C. Jane Hunter's translation gives us a book of great power that resembles a Muslim Vagina Monologues. The Almond is an inspiring and illuminating novel that reminds us of the transformative power of desire and pleasure.",

The nation\u2019s rise is one of the great international stories of the late twentieth century, and in India Unbound the acclaimed columnist Gurcharan Das offers a sweeping economic history of India from independence to the new millennium. Das shows how India\u2019s policies after 1947 condemned the nation to a hobbled economy until 1991, when the government instituted sweeping reforms that paved the way for extraordinary growth.  Das traces these developments and tells the stories of the major players from Nehru through today. As the former CEO of Proctor & Gamble India, Das offers a unique insider\u2019s perspective and he deftly interweaves memoir with history, creating a book that is at once vigorously analytical and vividly written. Impassioned, erudite, and eminently readable, India Unbound is a must for anyone interested in the global economy and its future.",

Thompson, Ph.D., coauthor of Raising Cain).Mary Pipher reveals to parents the problems girls face in Reviving Ophelia; now in Girls Will Be Girls, JoAnn Deak offers solutions. Looking past the \"scare\" stories to those that enlighten parents and enable them to empower girls, Deak draws from the latest brain research on girls to illustrate the exciting new ways in which we can help our daughters learn and thrive. Most telling of all, she gives us the voices of girls themselves as they struggle with body image, self-esteem, intellectual growth, peer pressure, and media messages. The result is a masterly book that addresses the key issues for girls growing up; one that fulfills a desperate need for clear guiding principles to help mothers, fathers, and their daughters navigate this chaotic contemporary culture.",
