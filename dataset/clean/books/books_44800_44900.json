        "Title": "Managing Risk: Methods for Software Systems Development",
        "Authors": "By Hall, Elaine M., Ph.D.",
        "Description": "\"The increasing rate of technological change we are experiencing in our lifetime yields competitive advantage to organizations and individuals who are willing to embrace risk and the opportunities it presents. Those who choose to minimize or avoid risk, as opposed to managing it, set a course for obsolescence. Hall has captured the essence of risk management and given us a practical guide for the application of useful principles in software-intensive product development. This is must reading for public and private sector managers who want to succeed as we begin the next century.\"   - Daniel P. Czelusniak, Director, Acquisition Program Integration Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology) The Pentagon   \"Since it is more than just common sense, the newcomer to risk management needs an intelligent guide. It is in this role that Elaine Hall's book excels. This book provides a set of practical and well-delineated processes for implementation of the discipline.\"   - Tom DeMarco, from the Foreword  Risk is inherent in the development of any large software system. A common approach to risk in software development is to ignore it and hope that no serious problems occur. Leading software companies use quantitative risk management methods as a more useful approach to achieve success.   Written for busy professionals charged with delivering high-quality products on time and within budget, Managing Risk is a comprehensive guide that describes a success formula for managing software risk. The book is divided into five parts that describe a risk management road map designed to take you from crisis to control of your software project.   Highlights include:   Six disciplines for managing product development.   Steps to predictable risk-management process results.   How to establish the infrastructure for a risk-aware culture.   Methods for the implementation of a risk management plan.   Case studies of people in crisis and in control.",

        "Title": "American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson",
        "Authors": "By Ellis, Joseph J.",
        "Description": "National Bestseller For a man who insisted that life on the public stage was not what he had in mind, Thomas Jefferson certainly spent a great deal of time in the spotlight--and not only during his active political career. After 1809, his longed-for retirement was compromised by a steady stream of guests and tourists who made of his estate at Monticello a virtual hotel, as well as by more than one thousand letters per year, most from strangers, which he insisted on answering personally. In his twilight years Jefferson was already taking on the luster of a national icon, which was polished off by his auspicious death (on July 4, 1826); and in the subsequent seventeen decades of his celebrity--now verging, thanks to virulent revisionists and television documentaries, on notoriety--has been inflated beyond recognition of the original person.For the historian Joseph J. Ellis, the experience of writing about Jefferson was \"as if a pathologist, just about to begin an autopsy, has discovered that the body on the operating table was still breathing.\" InAmerican Sphinx, Ellis sifts the facts shrewdly from the legends and the rumors, treading a path between vilification and hero worship in order to formulate a plausible portrait of the man who still today \"hover[s] over the political scene like one of those dirigibles cruising above a crowded football stadium, flashing words of inspiration to both teams.\" For, at the grass roots, Jefferson is no longer liberal or conservative, agrarian or industrialist, pro- or anti-slavery, privileged or populist. He is all things to all people. His own obliviousness to incompatible convictions within himself (which left him deaf to most forms of irony) has leaked out into the world at large--a world determined to idolize him despite his foibles.From Ellis we learn that Jefferson sang incessantly under his breath; that he delivered only two public speeches in eight years as president, while spending ten hours a day at his writing desk; that sometimes his political sensibilities collided with his domestic agenda, as when he ordered an expensive piano from London during a boycott (and pledged to \"keep it in storage\"). We see him relishing such projects as the nailery at Monticello that allowed him to interact with his slaves more palatably, as pseudo-employer to pseudo-employees. We grow convinced that he preferred to meet his lovers in the rarefied region of his mind rather than in the actual bedchamber. We watch him exhibiting both great depth and great shallowness, combining massive learning with extraordinary na\u00efvet\u00e9, piercing insights with self-deception on the grandest scale. We understand why we should neither beatify him nor consign him to the rubbish heap of history, though we are by no means required to stop loving him. He is Thomas Jefferson, after all--our very own sphinx.",

        "Description": "This book examines how it was possible and what it meant for ordinary factory workers to become effective unionists and national political participants by the mid-1930s. We follow Chicago workers as they make choices about whether to attend ethnic benefit society meetings or to go to the movies, whether to shop in local neighborhood stores or patronize the new A & P. Although workers may not have been political in traditional terms during the '20s, as they made daily decisions like these, they declared their loyalty in ways that would ultimately have political significance.     As the depression worsened in the 1930s, not only did workers find their pay and working hours cut or eliminated, but the survival strategies they had developed during the 1920s were undermined. Looking elsewhere for help, workers adopted new ideological perspectives and overcame longstanding divisions among themselves to mount new kinds of collective action. Chicago workers' experiences as citizens, ethnics and blacks, wage earners and consumers all converged to make them into New Deal Democrats and CIO unionists.",

He reviews the latest theories and research on internal motivation and shows how they apply to elementary school, where competition is as important as cooperation and students do better being led rather than bossed, to middle school, where positive relationships become so important and students begin to understand the importance of their choices, to high school, in which simple enforcement changes to teaching responsibility and creating a need-satisfying environment.

        "Description": "Orphaned at birth, Eliza Sommers is raised in the British colony of Valpara\u00edso, Chile, by the well-intentioned Victorian spinster Miss Rose and her more rigid brother Jeremy. Just as she meets and falls in love with the wildly inappropriate Joaqu\u00edn Andieta, a lowly clerk who works for Jeremy, gold is discovered in the hills of northern California. By 1849, Chileans of every stripe have fallen prey to feverish dreams of wealth. Joaqu\u00edn takes off for San Francisco to seek his fortune, and Eliza, pregnant with his child, decides to follow him. So begins Isabel Allende's enchanting new novel, Daughter of Fortune, her most ambitious work of fiction yet. As we follow her spirited heroine on a perilous journey north in the hold of a ship to the rough-and-tumble world of San Francisco and northern California, we enter a world whose newly arrived inhabitants are driven mad by gold fever. A society of single men and prostitutes among whom Eliza moves--with the help of her good friend and savior, the Chinese doctor Tao Chien--California opens the door to a new life of freedom and independence for the young Chilean. Her search for the elusive Joaqu\u00edn gradually turns into another kind of journey that transforms her over time, and what began as a search for love ends up as the conquest of personal freedom. By the time she finally hears news of him, Eliza must decide who her true love really is. Daughter of Fortune is a sweeping portrait of an era, a story rich in character, history, violence, and compassion. In Eliza, Allende has created one of her most appealing heroines, an adventurous, independent-minded, and highly unconventional young woman who has the courage to reinvent herself and to create her own destiny in a new country. A marvel of storytelling, Daughter of Fortune confirms once again Isabel Allende's extraordinary gift for fiction and her place as one of the world's leading writers.",

Nancy Meagher. But when he sees the old Dodge Swinger by the side of the road, two kids staring helplessly at its flat tire, he has to stop.\"If I ever got lost or anything, would you come help me?\" The boy's entreaty triggers a long-buried memory from Vietnam, and Cuddy makes him a solemn promise. Eddie seems a typical ten-year-old, but for the red birthmark that runs across his face like a map of Texas. His companion, a teenage girl named Melinda, is scared yet defiant. Cuddy changes their tire and soon they are back on the road. Except for the blue New Hampshire pick-up that briefly pulls over, its driver a rough, inquisitive character sporting a southern twang, Cuddy doesn't give the event much thought - until the next day, when the Globe reports the body of a young woman fished out of a South Boston channel. In the background of the photo accompanying the article is a Dodge Swinger. There is no mention of a boy.Some basic detective work sends Cuddy north to the hardscrabble town of Elton, New Hampshire, where Polly and Thomas Haldon, Eddie's fundamentalist parents, insist their son - with the devil's Mark of Cain upon his face - is now safe in the hands of the Lord at a Christian institute. Reluctantly, the Dr. Pepper-drinking chief of police tips Cuddy off about Lonnie Severn, the mysterious driver of the pick-up. Breaking into Severn's lonely trailer, Cuddy finds trouble - the serious kind.With fake I.D. provided by an old pro called Sneezer, Cuddy heads south to the Florida Keys...to a church on the remote island of Little Mercy, where the faithfuls' practiced smiles conceal a blood-chilling secret. A lovely Conch barmaid - who ruefully admires his unshakeable commitment to Nancy - becomes a staunch ally, although defending her from a drunk almost costs Cuddy his freedom. Cuddy also meets a World War II vet whose glory days are far from over and his equally gutsy wife, who help Cuddy mastermind a daring plan to breach the church's defenses. Charging into a deadly swamp of greed, child abuse, police corruption, and pure madness, Cuddy will do the impossible to keep his promise to a little boy....",

        "Title": "Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire",
        "Authors": "By Ferguson, Niall",
        "Description": "Is America an empire? Certainly not, according to our government.\u00a0Despite the conquest of two sovereign states in as many years, despite the presence of more than 750 military installations in two thirds of the world\u2019s countries and despite his stated intention \"to extend the benefits of freedom...to every corner of the world,\" George W. Bush maintains that \"America has never been an empire.\" \"We don\u2019t seek empires,\" insists Defense Secretary Rumsfeld. \"We\u2019re not imperialistic.\"\u00a0Nonsense, says Niall Ferguson. In Colossus he argues that in both military and economic terms America is nothing less than the most powerful empire the world has ever seen. Just like the British Empire a century ago, the United States aspires to globalize free markets, the rule of law, and representative government. In theory it\u2019s a good project, says Ferguson. Yet Americans shy away from the long-term commitments of manpower and money that are indispensable if rogue regimes and failed states really are to be changed for the better. Ours, he argues, is an empire with an attention deficit disorder, imposing ever more unrealistic timescales on its overseas interventions. Worse, it\u2019s an empire in denial\u2014a hyperpower that simply refuses to admit the scale of its global responsibilities. And the negative consequences will be felt at home as well as abroad. In an alarmingly persuasive final chapter Ferguson warns that this chronic myopia also applies to our domestic responsibilities. When overstretch comes, he warns, it will come from within\u2014and it will reveal that more than just the feet of the American colossus is made of clay.Niall Ferguson's new book\u00a0The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook\u00a0will be published in January 2018.",

        "Description": "Millions of women experience a traumatic loss of sexual desire during menopause. Although estrogen and progesterone alleviate many of the unpleasant effects of menopause, these hormones cannot address flagging sexual desire. Dr. Susan Rako's breakthrough research has brought to light the fact that the female body produces significant amounts of testosterone that are crucial to the healthy functioning of every woman's libido, thus linking decreased testosterone levels at the onset of menopause to diminished sex drive. The Hormone of Desire is the first book to fully reveal the benefits of testosterone supplements for menopausal women and is an invaluable tool for women and their doctors.",

        "Title": "Winston Churchill",
        "Authors": "By Keegan, John",
        "Description": "When today's world leaders require inspiration and strength in times of crisis, they often invoke Winston Churchill. The son of a member of Parliament, Churchill, a poor academic student, wanted to be a soldier early in life. At this he succeeded brilliantly, fighting fearlessly on the frontiers of the British Empire but eventually being captured. His escape from a South African prison camp led him to national fame and catapulted him into a life of politics.In this Penguin Life, the eminent historian John Keegan charts Churchill's career, examining his steadfast leadership as prime minister during the catastrophic events of World War II while England was dangerously poised on the brink of collapse. With wonderful eloquence, Keegan illuminates Churchill's incredible strength during this crucial moment in history and his unshakable belief that democracy would prevail. Keegan looks at Churchill's speeches which are some of the greatest examples of English oratory, and identifies his ability to communicate his own idea of an English past as the source of Churchill's greatness. He also sheds light on the political climate of Churchill's time. The result is an insightful, sensitive portrait of Churchill the war leader and Churchill the man.",

        "Description": "The New York Times comes each morning and never fails to deliver news of the important dead. Every day is new; every day is fraught with significance. I arrange my cup of tea, prop up my slippers. Obituaries are history as it is happening. Whose time am I living in? Was he a success or a failure, lucky or doomed, older than I am or younger? Did she know how to live? I shake out the pages. Tell me the secret of a good life!Where else can you celebrate the life of the pharmacist who moonlighted as a spy, the genius behind Sea Monkeys, the school lunch lady who spent her evenings as a ballroom hostess? No wonder so many readers skip the news and the sports and go directly to the obituary page.The Dead Beat is the story of how these stories get told. Enthralled by the fascinating lives that were marching out of this world, Marilyn Johnson tumbled into the obits page to find out what made it so lively. She sought out the best obits in the English language and chased the people who spent their lives writing about the dead. Surveying the darkest corners of Internet chat rooms, surviving a mass gathering of obituarists, and making a pilgrimage to London to savor the most caustic and literate obits of all, Marilyn Johnson leads us into the cult and culture behind the obituary page. The result is a rare combination of scrapbook and compelling read, a trip through recent history and the unusual lives we don't quite appreciate until they're gone.",
