So here's a collection of more than a hundred of the most ridiculous real warning labels on today's products.  For example:CAUTION: DO NOT ON USE THIS HAMMER TO STRIKE ANY SOLID OBJECT.Such as, perhaps, the head of the idiot who came up with this warning in the first place?In addition, the book includes two dozen hilarious peel-off fake warning labels you can stick on real products to keep you, your friends, and your loved ones safe.

It\u2019s the realization of one of the core beliefs of our democracy: Anyone can be president.Or is it? What if a close analysis showed that the candidates were, for the most part, getting their financing from the same corporations and lobbyists \u2026 that they all went to the same schools \u2026 that their votes were remarkably similarly on most issues \u2026?In a rollicking piece of journalism based on years of reporting, John R. MacArthur, the publisher of Harper\u2019s Magazine, talks to truly independent candidates\u2014including the first ever post-election interview of Joe Lieberman nemesis Ned Lamont\u2014about what they were up against. He gives the most detailed breakdown yet of campaign financing sources. He analyzes the parameters of the two party system, what the Constitution has to say about that, and how the media treats independent politicians. And he also discusses how all this influences issues of local democracy.It\u2019s an edgy, fascinating look at the system that\u2019s a must-read to understand whether the most historic election in American history is really going to be about change \u2026 or not.",

The girl\u2019s deceased family has  been branded as heretical, and no one in Egypt will speak their names.

        "Description": "As the grandson of Billy and Ruth Bell Graham, Tullian Tchividjian grew up hearing the Christian faith preached to millions. Yet he struggled to come to faith personally. His first book, Do I Know God?captures the sincerity and intensity of his own spiritual quest, and shows the way for a new generation of seekers.Combining careful thinking, warm personal story, and an exceptional grounding in biblical truths, Tullian delivers trustworthy answers to the questions you\u2019ve been asking:\u00b7Is it really possible to know God?\u00b7Is being \u201cspiritual\u201d or \u201creligious\u201d the same thing as having a relationship with God?\u00b7What is the relationship between saving faith and good works?\u00b7How does believing God\u2019s promises assure me of salvation?\u00b7How do my feelings for God affect my relationship with him?\u00b7How can I trust that God is present when I feel only his absence?\u00b7Can a relationship with God assure me of a future with him in eternity?Do I Know God? was written with a wide range of readers in mind: those outside the Christian faith, newer Christ followers who feel confused about their relationship with God, and long-time Christians who have never gotten clarity on key questions like eternal security and assurance of salvation, faith and works.Tullian shows readers how to discover a genuine, vibrant and enduring relationship with God. And it all begins with the vital question:Do I Know God?",

As you discover ways to boost your child\u2019s  good (green light) behavior, curb his annoying (yellow light) behavior, and immediately  stop his unacceptable (red light) behavior you will learn how to soothe his stormy  outbursts with amazing success\u2014and better yet, prevent these outbursts before they  begin!

An essential teaching tool and resource for novice to advanced mountaineers, Freedom is the standard text for climbing courses throughout the United States and abroad, and even has been used as a training manual by the U.S. military.Completely updated and revised, the 5th edition redefines the basics with the latest information on climbing techniques, snow and glacier travel, weather, safety, first aid, and leadership. Expanded chapters on first steps, belaying, and aid climbing and pitoncraft, plus several new sections on rock climbing, help broaden skill and expertise. Freedom covers the latest in equipment, including plastic boots, specialized rock shoes, step-in/clamp-on crampons, interior-frame packs, modern spring-loaded camming devices, ice-climbing tools, and belay and rappel devices. A completely new chapter on winter and expedition climbing rounds out this exhaustive edition, making Freedom the most comprehensive and contemporary source available on mountaineering.More than 350 all-new illustrations, created from photographs of climbers demonstrating specific procedures, depict and clarify instructions in the text. And, in keeping with today's environmental concerns, Freedom emphasizes clean climbing and low-impact wilderness use.The 5th edition of Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills is a consensus of accepted, safe methods and principles of mountaineering. Written and coordinated by the Mountaineers, a Seattle-based outdoor organization founded in 1906, it draws upon the knowledge of active, experienced mountaineers within and outside the club. Freedom continues a tradition of excellence by gathering the wisdom, instruction, and experience of some of the world's best climbers into one indispensable volume.",

        "Description": "From the bestselling author of She\u2019s Not There comes another buoyant, unforgettable memoir\u2014I\u2019m Looking Through You is about growing up in a haunted house...and making peace with the ghosts that dwell in our hearts.For Jennifer Boylan, creaking stairs, fleeting images in the mirror, and the remote whisper of human voices were everyday events in the Pennsylvania house in which she grew up in the 1970s. But these weren\u2019t the only specters beneath the roof of the mansion known as the \u201cCoffin House.\u201d Jenny herself\u2014born James\u2014lived in a haunted body, and both her mysterious, diffident father and her wild, unpredictable sister would soon become ghosts to Jenny as well.I\u2019m Looking Through You is an engagingly candid investigation of what it means to be \u201chaunted.\u201d Looking back on the spirits who invaded her family home, Boylan launches a full investigation with the help of a group of earnest, if questionable, ghostbusters. Boylan also examines the ways we find connections between the people we once were and the people we become. With wit and eloquence, Boylan shows us how love, forgiveness, and humor help us find peace\u2014with our ghosts, with our loved ones, and with the uncanny boundaries, real and imagined, between men and women.",
