        "Authors": "By Green, Joey and Corcoran, Alan",
        "Description": "Every 18 seconds another Baby Boomer turns 50 and confronts that dreaded milestone: middle age. But the \"Me Generation\" seems to be defining middle age based on a projected life span of 120 years. In other words, they're in denial, big time.This lighthearted book will clear up any confusion readers might have about whether they're still young at heart, or if they're being dragged kicking and screaming over the threshold of middle age.It's indisputable that you've reached middle age if . . .* You watch reruns of Leave it to Beaver, The Brady Bunch, or The Wonder Years and you identify with the parents.* You remember when meat, potatoes, and gravy were considered a well-balanced meal.* The only illegal herbs you're interested in smuggling into the country are Cuban cigars.* You've come to the annoying realization that your parents were right about almost everything.* Your computer has more memory than you do.* You remember when TVs had antennas and telephones had cords.You Know You've Reached Middle Age If . . . also includes bonus sections like \"What Others Say About Middle Age\" (with witty celebrity quotes) and \"There's Still Hope,\" listing notable late bloomers and their accomplishments. A couple of these inspiring tidbits: Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe at 59, and at 77 John Glenn orbited the Earth in a space shuttle.This charming and clever look at the mature lifestyle will gently break the news to readers that they're middle aged, and humorously assure them that that's okay.",

She brilliantly shows how, in a desperate attempt to save one man from the gallows and another from ignominy, two powerful families came together and began to create the version of history we know today. The true story of the mutiny on the Bounty is an epic of duty and heroism, pride and power, and the assassination of a brave man\u2019s honor at the dawn of the Romantic age.",

All roads lead to Jim Clark, the man who rewrote the rules of American capitalism as the founder of (so far) three multi-billion dollar companies--Silicon Graphics, Netscape, and Healtheon. Lewis's shrewd, often brilliantly funny, narrative provides ahead-of-the-curve observations about the Internet explosion and how the success of Silicon Valley companies is forcing a reassessment of traditional Wall-Street business models.    Weaving Clark's story together with that of this new business phenomenon, Lewis has drawn us a map of markets and free enterprise in the twenty-first century and blown the lid off the changing economy.",

He's convinced that his boss, Victor Lazar, is responsible for his half-brother's murder. He cannot put his secret investigation at risk, but he can't stop wanting her--craving her--and soon he knows he can't let Victor have her. For Raine may be Victor's next victim. . .Every Breath You TakeRaine knows she's being watched--but no one can see the secrets in her heart.

Offering her body to him, surrendering totally to his ruthless desire might well push her beyond all emotional limits--and beyond fear itself.",

        "Authors": "By Morell, Virginia",
        "Description": "Sacred, mysterious, powerful, the Blue Nile has carved a deep channel through human history. From its source in the wild Ethiopian highlands, this river passes through some of the most untamed country on Earth as it rushes toward its desert rendezvous with the White Nile in Sudan. More than one adventurer has perished in the Blue Nile Corge, whose hazards range from raging rapids to menacing crocodiles to armed bandits.  When National Geographic invited Virginia Morell to join its 1999 expedition -- which hoped to be the first to descend the river in a single, uninterrupted trip from its source to the Sudan border -- she jumped at the chance to revisit Ethiopia, a land she'd come to love during a sojourn many years before. The only African country never colonized by Europeans, its history spans more than two millennia from King Menelik, said in legend to be the son of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, to Ras Tafari, better known to the West as Haile Selassie, who ruled until his overthrow in 1974. This is an insular culture, isolated by geography and tradition, where ferenjjoch visitors are greeted with curiosity and courtesy -- and sometimes suspicion, after three decades of military rule and a long war with Eritrea.  Highlighted by Nevada Wier's evocative photographs, Morell's engrossing account introduces a world where tribesmen still hunt leopards with spears, and where villagers sometimes journey for days to catch a glimpse of foreigners and their marvelous boats. We linger at an impromptu concert and feast with people who have never seen a white face before, meet patriarchs whose Christianity stretches back to the Roman Empire, and face off with Kalashnikov-toting militiamen who may not be able to read the documents they demand. By the time we reach the border town of Bumbadi, we've been taken on an unforgettable journey through time -- and among a strong people who've resisted the advances of the modern world.",

In a letter to her daughter -- whom she was forced to give up at birth -- Miriam presents a haunting flashback to a shtetl in Belarus, where everyone except herself knew the secret of her parents' past and the mystery behind her young mother's suicide. As Miriam narrates the story of her poignant childhood, she brings to life the culture of the shtetl in the last days of imperial Russia, a community caught between the rich yet rigid traditions of the past and the frightening, unfamiliar ways of a society desperately trying to reinvent itself. A story of love and loss, crime and punishment, Your Mouth Is Lovely captures an ordinary woman caught in the circumstances of her era, and shows how small choices, twists of fate, and betrayals can determine a particular life, even at the great, transitional moments in history.",

        "Description": "The venture capital industry in the United States has grown dramatically over the last two decades. Annual inflows to venture funds have expanded from virtually zero in the mid-1970s to more than $9 billion in 1997. Many of the most visible new firms\u2014including Apple Computer, Genentech, Intel, Lotus, Microsoft, and Yahoo\u2014have been backed by venture capital funds. Yet despite this tremendous growth and its visible success, venture capital remains a mysterious industry. Numerous misconceptions persist about the nature and role of venture capitalists.Paul Gompers and Josh Lerner's extensive research on venture capital organizations is based largely on original data sets developed through close relationships with institutional investors in venture capital funds and investment advisors. The Venture Capital Cycle synthesizes their path-breaking work. After a historical overview, the book looks at the formation of funds, the investment of the funds in operating companies, and the liquidation of these investments. The concluding chapter provides a road map for future research in this growing area.Three themes run throughout the book. The first is that all venture capitalists confront tremendous incentive and information problems. The second is that because the various stages of the venture capital processes are related, the entire process is best viewed as a cycle. The third is that, unlike most financial markets, the venture capital industry adjusts very slowly to shifts in the supply of capital and the demand for financing.",

        "Description": "A rare and powerful story of hope, love, survival,and the struggle to bring back alive a hostage in IraqMicah Garen and Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Carleton were journalists and filmmakers working in Iraq on a documentary about the looting of the country's legendary archaeological sites, with their Iraqi translator Amir Doshi. In the late summer of 2004, they began to wrap up their work, and Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne returned home while Micah remained for a final two weeks of filming. As Micah and Amir were filming in a Nasiriyah market, something went horribly wrong: Micah, who wore a bushy mustache and was dressed in Iraqi clothing, was unmasked as a foreigner and kidnapped by militants in southern Iraq.Home in New York, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne awoke to a gut-wrenching phone call from Micah's mother with word of his abduction. She promised Micah's mother the impossible--that together they would bring Micah back alive.American Hostage is the remarkable memoir of Micah Garen's harrowing abduction and survival in captivity, as well as the heroic and successful struggle of Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne; Micah's sister, Eva; along with family and friends to win Micah's and Amir's release from their captors.  The world watched and waited as Micah's drama unfolded, but the authors, now safely home and engaged to be married, detail the dramatic untold story.After learning of Micah's abduction, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne took a risky and unusual step: instead of relying on the authorities to rescue Micah, she used her recent experience in Iraq to construct a massive grassroots effort to reach out to Micah's captors and plead for his release. As fighting between Coalition forces and the Mahdi Army raged in Najaf, Micah and Amir became pawns in a terrible political game. The kidnappers released a video threatening to kill Micah unless the United States withdrew from Najaf within forty-eight hours. In response, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's and Micah's families redoubled their efforts, eventually sending a representative to Nasiriyah to lobby for Micah. While Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne worked on his release, Micah, imprisoned alongside Amir under armed guard deep in the marshes of southern Iraq, lived the nightmare of a hostagehaunted by the alternating impulses of hope and despair, his desire for survival and plans of escape. His experience reveals a great deal about the lives and minds of militants in southern Iraq.American Hostage is an engrossing and rare story of how hope, love, and communal effort can overcome war, distance, and cultural differences in Iraq.",

        "Description": "Since Cathy's debut in 1976, she has become the symbol of single womanhood in all its glory--she's not just getting older, she's getting better.Dating dilemmas, diet disasters, and dressing room traumas. Cathy, America's favorite comic strip woman-on-the-go, has suffered them all--and endeared herself to readers in the process.Cathy's cartoon life has hilariously mirrored the path of women everywhere. In fact, Cathy book titles provide an uncanny overview of the feminine perspective: A Mouthful of Breath Mints and No One to Kiss, Wake Me Up When I'm Size 5, and $14 in the Bank and $200 Face in My Purse.Cathy continues to entertain millions of readers daily as she shares her personal and professional struggles highlighted by her on-again, off-again romance with Irving, the hysterical give and take with her overprotective and obsessive mother, and, of course, her battle against the bulge.Among the highlights of this cartoon collection, Cathy, \"careening toward bankruptcy\" as she puts it, cuts up her credit cards and joins Shoppers Anonymous. She then discovers Irving is dating an environmental activist and she herself becomes environmentally conscious...for three hours. Intermixed with the subplots are Cathy's wardrobe traumas ranging from swimsuit try-ons to the time she makes the fatal mistake of removing her \"big, swinging coat\" while wearing only a skin-tight unitard underneath.",

Kilcannon believes he can make the system work. And he just may die trying.Driven by the violent nightmare of his childhood, fueled by forces that few could understand, and burdened by secrets no one must know, Kilcannon is running for President--and entering the crucial battleground of California with seven days to go. But for Kilcannon, there are hurdles that his courage, charisma, and compassion may not overcome: the network correspondent he still loves; the reporter bent on their exposure; the rival who'll do anything to win; and the fanatic who believes that he must murder Kilcannon to protect the right to life.",

        "Description": "\"I eat when I'm stressed out.\"\"I'm addicted to junk food.\"\"I'm always on a diet.\"Sound familiar?In Get a Real Food Life, high-energy food coach Janine Whiteson teaches you the skills you need to regain control over your relationship with food. When you create a Real Food Life, you're able to enjoy all of the food you eat, secure in the knowledge that it's nourishing you-- mind, body, and soul. Your new Real Food Life is all about eating when you're hungry, choosing foods that make you feel great, and strategically eliminating those that drag you down.Janine believes that rather than helping you gain control, restrictive diets and trendy eating plans actually do the opposite-- decrease control and increase obsession. As she guides you through the sometimes treacherous minefield of junk food and emotional eating, she'll show you a life where you're not obsessed by \"forbidden\" foods.Drawing on years of client experience and dozens of recipes, checklists, quizzes, and tips, Janine guides you through her trademark 8-week plan, peppered with fun activities, like the Kitchen Makeover and the Get Real Check-In. She helps you \"diagnose\" your current diet, eating patterns, and food choices. Using that information, Janine then helps you replace self-defeating eating habits with energy-enhancing, delicious food choices. She even includes specially designed strategies for managing family eating dynamics, holiday cocktail parties, stressful times at work, and more.Along the way, Janine shares an intimate look into the personal lives of 11 of her clients. Read their stories, torn from the pages of their personal diaries, and then follow their progress as Janine tells how she helped them overcome challenges to achieve their Real Food Lives.One thing Janine won't talk about is a \"perfect\" food life. Instead, she talks about what's \"real\"-- real choices, real food, real solutions, when you get a Real Food Life, you are in charge.",

        "Description": "Item 1: An alembic is the top part of an apparatus used for distilling. This one is made of sturdy green glass, thirty-six centimeters tall, eighteen centimeters around at the widest point of its base. The top part of the vessel is narrow and fluted and turns sharply to the right; alembics are set over a still to collect and carry vapors to another vessel. The vessel's inside bears a crust of gray material that seems to be a mixture of lead, iron, and antimony, as well as some organic matter, canine and human bones. Scorch marks are visible on the outside bottom, extending five centimeters up. No discernible odor.  Date of manufacture: unknown. Estimates range from 100 b.c. to a.d. 300 Place of origin: Hellenistic Egypt. \"Alembic\" comes from the Arabic \"al-anbiq,\" which comes from the Greek \"ambix,\" meaning cup or beaker Last known owner: Woldemar L\u00f6wendahl, Danish-Estonian governor general of Tallinn. The alembic was unearthed during the construction of Kassari chapel on Kassari Island in April 1723 and brought to L\u00f6wendahl's office that June. The governor general placed it on the top shelf of an unfilled bookcase in the back corner of his office and never noticed when it went missing two years, six months, and seventeen days later...  When a twelfth-century Sicilian cat burglar snatches a sack of artifacts from the king's geographer's library, the tools and talismans of transmutation-and eternal life-are soon scattered all over the world. Nine hundred years later, a young Connecticut reporter finds evidence that someone is collecting them again. In the process of investigating the suspicious death of a local professor, Paul Tomm finds the dead man's heavily fortified office stuffed with books on alchemy. The Geographer's Library entwines his contemporary reporting with a chain of ancient stories-within-the-story, tracking the last time each of the geographer's tools changed hands-some bought, some stolen, some killed for.  The Geographer's Library is an extraordinary debut, smart, stylishly written, and full of suspense. It tempts with the glitter of antiquities and hooks with a chilling plot. In this brilliant debut, competing visions of an obscure professor's life take a young reporter from a sleepy New England town to the heart of an international smuggling ring that may hold the secret to eternal life.",

Adams is the founder of the Gesundheit Institute, a home-based medical practice that has treated more than 15,000 people for free, and that is now building a full-scale hospital that will be open to anyone in the world free of charge. Ambitious? Yes. Impossible? Not for those who know and work with Patch. Whether it means putting on a red clown nose for sick children or taking a disturbed patient outside to roll down a hill with him, Adams does whatever is necessary to help heal. In his frequent lectures at medical schools and international conferences, Adams's irrepressible energy cuts through the businesslike facade of the medical industry to address the caring relationship between doctor and patient that is at the heart of true medicine.  All author royalties are used to fund The Gesundheit Institute, a 40-bed free hospital in West Virginia. Adams's positive vision and plan for the future is an inspiration for those concerned with the inaccessibility of affordable, quality health care.  Today's high-tech medicine has become too costly, impersonal, and grim. In his frequent lectures to colleges, churches, community groups, medical schools, and conferences, Patch shows how healing can be a loving, creative, humorous human exchange--not a business transaction.",

        "Description": "On September 11, 2001, the courage and sacrifice of the New York City Fire Department inspired the nation, giving new meaning to the word \"hero.\" But the heroism of the firefighters was not unique to September 11--it has been part of the FDNY's tradition from the very beginning. Journalist Terry Golway, whose father, father-in-law, godfather, and uncles were all New York firefighters, tells as no one else could the story of the men and women, tragedies and triumphs of the FDNY throughout its history. From the original eighteenth-century volunteer force to the New York Firefighter unit in the Union Army, from the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire to the arson epidemic of the 1970s, to contemporary issues of diversity and efficiency, Golway's history holds up a mirror for firefighters throughout the U.S.In this first comprehensive chronicle of the FDNY in over sixty years, Golway weaves together stories of heroic firefighters and extraordinary fires to create a moving and original history of the city and the vocation as seen through the eyes of \"New York's Bravest.\" From America's most ambitious public-works project of the 1700s--the building of aqueducts from upstate to help control fires--to firefighter-turned-politician Boss Tweed's backroom politics, fire and firefighters have always been an integral part of the history of the city. Lively, gut-wrenching, and ultimately inspiring, So Others Might Live offers a new view of the building of American cities and the people who made them great.As a tribute to the firefighters of New York, Basic Books will donate a portion of its proceeds from the sale of So Others Might Live to the New York Firefighters 911 Disaster Relief Fund.",

        "Description": "Why do we age? Is aging inevitable? Will advances in medical knowledge allow us to extend the human lifespan beyond its present limits? Because growing old has long been the one irreducible reality of human existence, these intriguing questions arise more often in the context of science fiction than science fact. But recent discoveries in the fields of cell biology and molecular genetics are seriously challenging the assumption that human lifespans are beyond our control.         With such discoveries in mind, noted cell biologist William R. Clark clearly and skillfully describes how senescence begins at the level of individual cells and how cellular replication may be bound up with aging of the entire organism. He explores the evolutionary origin and function of aging, the cellular connections between aging and cancer, the  parallels between cellular senescence and Alzheimer's disease, and the insights gained through studying human genetic disorders--such as Werner's syndrome--that mimic the symptoms of aging.  Clark also explains how reduction in caloric intake may actually help increase lifespan, and how the destructive effects of oxidative elements in the body may be limited by the consumption of antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables.  In a final chapter, Clark considers the social and economic aspects of living longer, the implications of gene therapy on senescence, and what we might learn about aging from experiments in cloning. This is a highly readable, provocative account of some of the most far-reaching and controversial questions we are likely to ask in the next century.",

        "Description": "Cecelia Holland has written an extraordinary novel that ranges between two eras thousands of years apart and between two cultures as different as can be imagined, yet with striking similarities.Valley of the Kings re-creates an ancient Egypt that for centuries has been shrouded in mystery. It was a time of religious and political upheaval - the heretic Pharaoh Akhenaten's religious reforms had been defeated by the power of the Priests of Amun, and the young Boy King, Tutankhamun, had been placed on the throne. There was famine in the land, and ongoing deadly intrigue in the Court, as different factions maneuvered to gain control of Egypt. It ended in the mysterious death of the young king and his hasty, secret burial.Nearly thirty-five hundred years later, in the 1920s, a young British archaeologist, Howard Carter, becomes obsessed with finding Tutankhamun's tomb. In the course of his quest, Carter duels across time with the devious minds of the New Kingdom of Egypt. His experience digging in the Valley of the Kings has given him an insight into how the ancients thought, and he is sure that he can locate the tomb that all Egyptologists know must exist but no one can find. But he must struggle with more than the secretive nature of the ancient Egyptians - his work cannot go on without the approval of the modern Egyptian bureaucracy and the continued financial support of a British peer who is looking for treasure more than knowledge.",

        "Description": "Literature is full of lyrical odes to the glory of falling in love. But what of its opposite -- the moment when it becomes clear that things are indisputably over? Dumped is a survey of every type of romantic crack-up, a group of stories full of the hilarity, wisdom, insight, and sometimes, yes, fierce revenges of some of the most memorable broken hearts in recent literature. Dumped sheds light on what can be the toughest part of human relations -- whether newly elucidating the misery we've all endured, or merely reminding us that others have had it far worse -- from the mother in Elizabeth Berg's Open House absurdly attempting to tell her son his father has left, to the betrayed wife in Roald Dahl's \"Lamb to Slaughter,\" who beats her husband to death with a leg of lamb, then cooks it for the police. With contributions from such notable authors as Will Self, Saul Bellow, Alice Munro, Raymond Carver, Lorrie Moore, Dorothy Parker, Andre Dubus, and Tobias Wolff, as well as rising stars like Lucinda Rosenfeld and Steve Almond, Dumped spans every variety of romantic catastrophe and every possible response to it; from the wise to the hilarious, the bitter to the bittersweet. This book is the panacea for problems of the heart.",

        "Title": "Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino",
        "Authors": "By Benedict, Jeff",
        "Description": "In 1973, an old American Indian woman dies with nothing left of her tribe but a trailer and a two-hundred-acre reservation in the sleepy backyard of Ledyard, Connecticut. It seems to signal the end of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe. But it is just the beginning. Over the course of the next three decades, the reservation grows to more than two thousand acres and becomes home to Foxwoods, the largest casino in the world, grossing more than $1 billion per year. The Pequots are reborn, immensely wealthy, and in possession of an enormous amount of political influence.How did it happen?In compelling detail, Without Reservation tells the stunning story of the rise of the richest tribe in American history.It begins with the grand ambitions of two men. One, an unemployed navy brat and outsider, is a failed preacher with the uncanny ability to charm; the other is fresh out of law school and armed with a brilliant legal theory to help impoverished Indian tribes. Together they resurrect the Pequots and battle the local townspeople to aggressively expand their reservation, taking on the state government for the right to gamble on their land. Embracing their cause are misguided and misinformed government officials and a former mob prosecutor who brings Malaysian financiers to the table.The Pequots must also contend with the price of power. Without Reservation reveals the mysterious roots of today's Pequot tribe, the racial tension that divides them, and the Machiavellian internal Power struggle over who will control the tribe's purse strings.This is a story of the duality of the American dream, the good and the bad that come with enormous wealth. Author Jeff Benedict shines a light on the dreamers and the deal makers, the backroom politicking and courtroom machinations, the trusts and betrayals, and the world of high-powered attorneys, politicians, tribal leaders, and financiers who made the Pequots what they are today.As compelling as a novel, Without Reservation is must reading for anyone interested in the way today's world really works.",
