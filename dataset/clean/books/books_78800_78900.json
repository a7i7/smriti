Tried by War offers a revelatory (and timely) portrait of leadership during the greatest crisis our nation has ever endured. Suspenseful and inspiring, this is the story of how Lincoln, with almost no previous military experience before entering the White House, assumed the powers associated with the role of commander in chief, and through his strategic insight and will to fight changed the course of the war and saved the Union.",

Durant (1861-1947), the flamboyant businessman who made deals at warp speed to build General Motors and the automotive industry. Now in paperback, The Deal Maker brings Durant, a self-starter obsessed with making it and being seen as making it, to thrilling life. Thriving on the art of the deal, Durant was buying companies at the rate of one every thirty days at the height of his career. By 1910, he had brought together twenty-five automobile firms into what would become the General Motors empire. Then, gambling on a run on GM stock, Durant was forced into a buyout, which unseated him from GM, leaving him without the financial wherewithal to ever succeed again. Featuring some of the most important figures in the history of the automotive industry and American business, including Henry Ford, David Buick, Albert Champion, Louis Chevrolet, Alfred P. Sloan, and Pierre Du Pont, The Deal Maker is a fast-paced, rousing tale of Durant's dizzying success and abject failure.",

But the deadliest form is almost too scary to think about-a terrorist group exploding a nuclear device in an American city.In this urgent call to action, Graham Allison, one of America's leading experts on nuclear weapons and national security, presents the evidence for two provocative, compelling conclusions. First, if policy makers in Washington keep doing what they are currently doing about the threat, a nuclear terrorist attack on America is inevitable. Second, the surprising and largely unrecognized good news is that nuclear terrorism is, in fact, preventable. In these pages, Allison offers an ambitious but feasible blueprint for eliminating the possibility of nuclear terrorist attacks, if we are willing to face the issue squarely.",

As the narrative threads intersect and collide in surprising ways, the reader is carried along on a fantastic journey through the life of the artist. A master comics artist, here Eddie Campbell offers a complex, caustic, and surprising meditation on balancing the lonely life of the artist with the demands of everyday life.",

I was keeping watch on a dark stack of nimbus clouds off to the northwest, but we were leaving it far behind, and it looked to be smooth going all the way back to Lionsgate City. Like riding a cloud. . . .Matt Cruse is a cabin boy on the Aurora, a huge airship that sails hundreds of feet above the ocean, ferrying wealthy passengers from city to city. It is the life Matt's always wanted; convinced he's lighter than air, he imagines himself as buoyant as the hydrium gas that powers his ship. One night he meets a dying balloonist who speaks of beautiful creatures drifting through the skies. It is only after Matt meets the balloonist's granddaughter that he realizes that the man's ravings may, in fact, have been true, and that the creatures are completely real and utterly mysterious. In a swashbuckling adventure reminiscent of Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson, Kenneth Oppel, author of the best-selling Silverwing trilogy, creates an imagined world in which the air is populated by transcontinental voyagers, pirates, and beings never before dreamed of by the humans who sail the skies.",

At home, Elisa's father, the one person she feels understands her, has left on an extended business trip. As the days grow shorter, Elisa worries that the increasingly urgent letters she sends her father won't bring him home. Like the undercover agent she feels she has become, Elisa retreats to a pond in the woods, where her talent for ice-skating gives her the confidence to come out from under cover and take center stage. But when Lila becomes jealous of Theo's friendship with Elisa, her revenge nearly destroys Elisa's ice-skating dreams and her plan to reunite her family. National Book Award nominee Beth Kephart's first young adult novel is a stunning debut.",

They had their own invention with them-an emotional amplifier, which could cause anyone to feel a heightened emotion, but this wasn't useful at first. If they heightened the locals' sense of pride, they took pride in becoming better criminals. So they pretended to be the Royal Legions, sent by a distant star kingdom in pursuit of an all-powerful villain who was hiding on the planet. Things were going better than they could have hoped, and the planet was rapidly becoming civilized . . . and then the real Royal flagship showed up. They thought they were doomed-but instead they were told they had shown just the type of initiative and intelligence that the new arrivals were looking for. So they were inducted into the Interstellar Patrol. And that was just the beginning. . . .",

With each chapter she includes innovative book lists, such as a list of \"psychology and self-help books paired with fiction dealing with like concerns.\" Although written with an eye to those in the book selling business, Burton also keeps in mind the reason why any books are sold at all: readers with money in hand who are as passionate as she about books.

        "Description": "They met in 1990 during the first Palestinian uprising\u2014one was an American Jew who served as a prison guard in the largest prison in Israel, the other, his prisoner, Rafiq, a rising leader in the PLO.  Despite their fears and prejudices, they began a dialogue there that grew into a remarkable friendship\u2014and now a remarkable book.  It is a book that confronts head-on the issues dividing the Middle East, but one that also shines a ray of hope on that dark, embattled region.Jeffrey Goldberg, now an award-winning correspondent for The New Yorker, moved to Israel while still a college student.  When he arrived, there was already a war in his heart\u2014a war between the magnetic pull of tribe and the equally determined pull of the universalist ideal.  He saw the conflict between the Jews and Arabs as the essence of tragedy, because tragedy is born not in the collision of right and wrong, but of right and right.Soon, as a military policeman in the Israeli army, he was sent to the Ketziot military prison camp, a barbed-wire city of tents and machine gun towers buried deep in the Negev Desert. Ketziot held six thousand Arabs, the flower of the Intifada: its rock-throwers, knifemen, bomb-makers, and propagandists.  He realized that this was an extraordinary opportunity to learn from them about themselves, especially because among the prisoners may have been the future leaders of Palestine. Prisoners is an account of life in that harsh desert prison\u2014mean, overcrowded, and violent \u2014 and of Goldberg's extraordinary dialogue with Rafiq, which continues to this day.We hear their accusations, explanations, fears, prejudices, and aspirations.  We see how their relationship deepened over the years as Goldberg returned to Washington, D.C., where Rafiq, quite coincidentally, had become a graduate student, and as the Middle East cycled through periods of soaring hope and ceaseless despair. And we see again and again how these two men\u2014both of them loyal sons of their warring peoples\u2014confront their religious, cultural, and political differences in ways that  allowed them to finally acknowledge a  true, if necessarily tenuous, friendship.A riveting, deeply affecting book: spare, impassioned, energetic, and unstinting in its candor about the truths that lie buried within the animosities of the Middle East.",

Now, in his final work, former federal judge and veteran author William J. Coughlin combines an insightful look into our legal system with this beautifully crafted thriller.When billionaire banker Augustus Daren dies, a history of front-page scandal lives on with his controversial will. At the center of the conflict is his beautiful widow, Elizabeth, left with control of the bank and now accused by her rich and embittered stepchildren of holding Daren in her thrall after his severe stroke. Not only are billions at stake, but also the power to lead Daren's bank to dominate the international banking scene. Living in her remote northern Michigan estate, Elizabeth is as threatened by the ambition and greed of those who work for her as by her known enemies.To Jake Martin, a partner at a prestigious Detroit law firm, the case appears watertight, and he has a videotape of the signing of the will as proof. But when the tape disappears and key witnesses begin changing their stories, Jake finds that his own future is on the line. Unrealized resources of strength and determination force him to continue - to fight not simply the opposition, but the growing attraction he senses between himself and Elizabeth. As the court date approaches, Jake's position becomes increasingly isolated as Elizabeth's enemies become his own.In the Presence of Enemies is an authentic and powerful legal drama written by a courtroom expert, with twists and surprises right up to its stunning conclusion.",

Dinner after sports practice, music lessons, and play rehearsals has never been easier!In addition to recipes for hearty, family-pleasing classics such as Baked Pesto Ravioli with Chicken, Beef and Zucchini Casserole, and Cider-Braised Pork Loin Chops, Stephanie and Tina give a wealth of time-saving shopping tips and cooking pointers. More than for convenience, eating dinner together provides benefits for the whole family. Study after study shows that mealtime matters. Families who dine together form stronger bonds, and kids get better grades and develop lifelong healthful eating habits. Dream Dinners makes it easy for families to gather around the dinner table and share the ups and downs of the day.With Dream Dinners, you will spend less time stressing in the kitchen and more time connecting with family and friends.",
