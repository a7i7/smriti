        "Description": "From the mother of champion cyclist Lance Armstrong\u2014an extraordinary story of the resilience of the human spirit and the remarkable effect of great parenting.Lance Armstrong has dazzled the world with his six straight Tour de France championships, his winning personality, and his poignant victory over life-threatening cancer. Yet the adage that \"behind every strong man there is a stronger woman\" has never been more true than in Lance\u2019s case. His mother, Linda Armstrong Kelly, is a force of nature whose determination, optimism, and sheer joie de vivre not only nurtured one of our era\u2019s greatest athletes but fueled her own transformation from a poverty-stricken teen in the Dallas projects to a powerful role model for mothers everywhere. This luminous memoir, written with humor and compassion, tells Linda\u2019s story of survival.Pregnant at age seventeen, kicked out of her home, and mired in an abusive relationship, Linda was a perfect candidate for disaster. But armed with a fierce belief in herself as a work in progress, and buoyed by a tidal wave of love for her little boy, Linda flouted statistics and became both a corner-office executive and a no-nonsense, empowering mom whose desire to excel was contagious. Her resolve to find \u201cthe diamond in the Dumpster, the blessing in every bummer\u201d set an extraordinary example for Lance\u2014and will inspire everyday moms to dream big and make a difference.Funny, resonant, down-to-earth, and utterly unforgettable, No Mountain High Enough is exhilarating proof that sheer willpower can\u2014and occasionally does\u2014triumph over adversity.From Linda Armstrong Kelly\u2019s No Mountain High Enough:\u201cThis is what it means to be a mother, I realized. It had nothing to do with being old enough or knowing everything or keeping to a strict schedule. It had to do with loving someone with a love so huge, the rest of the world becomes insignificant by comparison. No fear I felt would ever amount to anything, compared to what I felt for my child. No task would ever be too hard for me. No one would ever be able to make me feel small. I was The Mama. You don\u2019t get any bigger than that.\u201d",

        "Title": "Ike: An American Hero",
        "Authors": "By Korda, Michael",
        "Description": "A big, ambitious, and enthralling new biography of Dwight D. Eisenhower, full of fascinating details and anecdotes, which places particular emphasis on his brilliant generalship and leadership in World War Two, and provides, with the advantage of hindsight, a far more acute analysis of his character and personality than any that has previously been available, reaching the conclusion that he was perhaps America's greatest general and one of America's best presidents, a man who won the war and thereafter kept the peace.  IKE starts with the story of D\u2013Day, the most critical moment in America's history. It was Hitler's last chance to win the war \u2013\u2013 he had the means to destroy the troops on the beaches, but he failed to react quickly enough. The one man who would have reacted quickly and decisively had he been on the spot, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, was home on leave and didn't arrive back at his headquarters until it was too late. It was Ike's plan, Ike's decision, Ike's responsibility. He alone, among all the Allied generals, could win or lose the war in one day, and knew it.  But of course there is more to this book than military history. It is a full biography of a remarkable man, ambitious, a late starter, a brilliant leader of men and perhaps the only American general who could command such a difficult coalition, and win the respect of not only his own soldiers, but also those of Great Britain and France, and lead them to a triumphant victory.  It is also the story of a remarkable family. Ike grew up in Abilene, Kansas, and the Eisenhowers were Mennonites, who, like the Amish, were deeply committed pacifists, so it is ironic that he went to West Point and became a general, to his mother's horror. It is as well the portrait of a tumultuous and often difficult marriage, for Mamie was every bit as stubborn and forceful as her husband, and it was by no means the sunny, happy marriage that Republican publicists presented to the public when Ike made his first moves towards the presidency.  Indeed, behind Ike's big grin and the easy\u2013going, affable personality he liked to project was a very different man, fiercely ambitious, hot\u2013tempered, shrewd, and tightly wound. He was a perfectionist for whom duty always came first, and a man of immense ability. In 1941 he was a soldier who was still an unknown and recently promoted colonel, and just two years later he was a four\u2013star general who had commanded the biggest and most successful amphibious operation in history \u2013\u2013 TORCH, the Anglo\u2013American invasion of North Africa. He commanded respect and was dealt as an equal with such world figures as President Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Charles De Gaulle.",

        "Description": "How much is too much to ask of friendship? How long will the bonds of family endure when confronted with swift, unexpected change? These are the intimate questions Jean Reynolds Page poses inA Blessed Event, her assured and powerful literary debut.Joanne Timbro and Darla Stevens have grown up in a small Texas town, their childhood homes separated only by adjoining back yards. Although the families inside these houses have little in common, the two girls find in each other a rare friendship that will take them into their adult lives; a friendship that makes them stronger together than either could be alone.Then as young women, Darla and Jo enter into an agreement that will startle everyone who cares for them. After years of watching Darla\u2019s heartbreaking failure to have a baby with her husband, Cal, Joanne agrees to give birth to the child that Darla cannot have on her own. But in the early morning hours of a warm July morning, everything changes. Joanne, then four months pregnant, is driving a car that veers off the road near the home that Darla shares with Cal.

Until now the business of baseball has been run with a degree of secrecy international intelligence agencies would envy. To get the facts about income and operations assembled in this book, Andrew Zimbalist has probed, dug, scraped, and begged for information from owners, players, and politicians. The result is an eye-opening account of greed, abuse of the public trust, and poor management that threaten the future of the game. Yet solutions are within our grasp, Zimbalist maintains.",

        "Title": "The End of Oil: On the Edge of a Perilous New World",
        "Authors": "By Roberts, Paul",
        "Description": "Petroleum is now so deeply entrenched in our economy, our politics, and our personal expectations that even modest efforts to phase it out are fought tooth and nail by the most powerful forces in the world: companies and governments that depend on oil revenues; the developing nations that see oil as the only means to industrial success; and a Western middle class that refuses to modify its energy-dependent lifestyle. But within thirty years, by even conservative estimates, we will have burned our way through most of the oil that is easily accessible. And well before then, the side effects of an oil-based society -- economic volatility, geopolitical conflict, and the climate-changing impact of hydrocarbon pollution -- will render fossil fuels an all but unacceptable solution. How will we break our addiction to oil? And what will we use in its place to maintain a global economy and political system that are entirely reliant on cheap, readily available energy?Brilliantly reported from around the globe, The End of Oil brings the world situation into fresh and dramatic focus for business and general readers alike. Roberts talks to both oil optimists and oil pessimists, delves deep into the economics and politics of oil, considers the promises and pitfalls of alternatives, and shows that, although the world energy system has begun its epoch-defining transition, disruption and violent dislocation are almost assured if we do not take a more proactive stance. With the topicality and readability of Fast Food Nation and the scope and trenchant analysis of Guns, Germs, and Steel, this is a vitally important book for the new century.",

What\u2019s the best\u2013and most economical\u2013way to feed a crowd of eight?

For date night you don\u2019t want tons of food, so Rachael\u2019s Croque Madame sandwich with a Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette salad and a killer vodka cocktail strike just the right note.  For family dinners, double dates, or those who love leftovers, Rachael whips up classic meals for four like Wingless Buffalo Chicken Pizza or Grilled Shrimp with Chorizo Skewers. For poker night with your buddies, Rachael knows exactly which ingredients stretch into a 30-minute meal for six, like Uptown Sweet and Spicy Sausage Hoagies. Throwing a  dinner party is a pleasure when you\u2019re armed with stress-free meals for eight like Italian Chicken Pot Pie and Boozy Berries and Biscuits.

December, in other words, is much cooler than April or June.* Although it sounds desertlike, Zahara is actually a Muslim and Swahili name meaning \"flower.\" In Hebrew, it denotes brightness.* If Cook and Sailor can be used as first names, why not Fisher?* Though it has a hippyish feel, Jupiter has a legitimate history as a first name, used in this country as far back as the eighteenth century-- in fact, Jupiter Hammon was the first African-American poet published here.* Malcolm's in the middle-- of a definite revival.Whether you already have a list of favorite names or are just beginning to look for ideas, Baby Names Now will provide the information and inspiration you need to make the perfect choice.",

        "Title": "Prince of Darkness: Richard Perle: The Kingdom, the Power & the End of Empire in America",

        "Description": "At nearly every pivotal moment in international politics over the past twenty-five years?from the Reagan-Gorbachev summits, to the Iran-Contra scandal, to the collapse of the Soviet Union, to the decision to go to war in Iraq?if you dug deeply you would find a figure just behind the scenes influencing the action: that of Richard Perle. Largely eschewing senior cabinet appointments and other high-profile roles, the passionate, zealous Perle has been content to operate quietly?behavior which earned him the moniker of The Prince of Darkness. Nevertheless, his influence in Washington has helped to fuel an international disaster in Iraq and the growth of anti-Americanism worldwide. Alan Weisman, a former producer for 60 Minutes, CBS Sunday Morning, and the CBS Evening News, is now shining a light on this major political figure.While Perle has not authorized this biography, he has submitted to interviews with Weisman, encouraged his friends to do so, and provided non-classified material. Such access has granted Weisman a deep and critical insight into Perle\u2019s methods and mindset. Weisman explores how Perle derailed a nuclear arms agreement between the U.S. and the then Soviet Union; his controversial business dealings; Perle\u2019s tenure as Chairman of the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Policy Board during the present Bush Administration; and his role leading up to the Iraqi War, including his dealings with Iraqi exiles like Ahmed Chalabi. From the collapse of the Soviet Union to the current saber-rattling over Iran, Syria, and North Korea, Perle has put his stamp on almost every decisive event in international politics. This is an insightful and incisive study of the highest quality, and one that everyone?not just policy experts?should read.From Prince of Darkness, What People Say about Richard Perle:?We used to have major problems when Richard would wander off the farm and be caught doing things that were not consistent with the policies that [Caspar] Weinberger and [George] Shultz were trying to implement.\u201d?Colin Powell, Secretary of State, 2001-2005?Richard can take a really bad idea and make it sound almost plausible and reasonable, even brilliant.\u201d?Richard Burt, Assistant Secretary of State, 1983-1985?I really don\u2019t understand Perle. If you talk about the real neocons, there\u2019s Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, and they\u2019re very different. Paul Wolfowitz is an idealist, but he\u2019s prepared to impose democracy by the sword. I don\u2019t think Perle gives a [bleep] about democracy. Fundamentally, it\u2019s all a means to an end.\u201d?Brent Scowcroft, National Security Advisor, 1989-1993",

She has moved to an island at the far reaches of the continent to restore the house of an equally haunted figure, her mysterious great-uncle; but as her life begins to rebuild itself along with the house, his story starts to wrap around hers.  Powerful forces are stirring, but Rae cannot see where her reality leaves off and his fate begins.Fifty-two years old, Rae must battle the feelings that have long tormented her--panic, melancholy, and a skin-crawling sense of watchers behind the trees. Before she came here, she believed that most of the things she feared existed only in her mind. And who can say, as disturbing incidents multiply, if any of the watchers on Folly Island might be real? Is Rae paranoid, as her family and the police believe, or is the threat real?  Is the island alive with promise--or with dangers?  With Folly, award-winning author LAURIE R. KING once again powerfully redefines  psychological suspense on a sophisticated and harrowing new level, and proves why legions of readers and reviewers have named her a master of the genre.",

He is a haiku-like imagist who imbues his poems with \"tender wisdom,\u201d and draws inspiration from the overlooked details of daily life.Praise for Delights and Shadows:\"Ted Kooser...has a genius for making the ordinary sacred.\"The New York Times\"A sense of wonder and compassion runs through this Pulitzer Prize winning volume Kooser's poetry is understated yet manages to skillfully illuminate the small moments of life.\"Christian Science Monitor\"[Kooser] brushes poems over ordinary objects, revealing metaphysical themes that way an investigator dusts for fingerprints. His language is so controlled and convincing that one can't help but feel significant truths behind his lines.\"The Philadelphia Inquirer\"There is a sense of quiet amazement at the core of all Kooser's work, but it especially seems to animate his new collection of poems,Delights & Shadows. Every delight is shadowed by darkness in this book of small wonders and hard dualisms.\"Edward Hirsch,The Washington Post\"Delights and Shadows is a book with a deep stillness at its center, perfectly self-contained.\"Carol Muske-Dukes,Los Angeles Times\"Kooser's ninth collection of poems reflects the simple and remarkable things of everyday life. That he often sees things we do not would be delight enough, but more amazing is exactly what he sees. Nothing escapes him; everything is illuminated.Highly recommended.\"Library Journal\"Few poets depict the Midwest so accurately or with such tender regard... Kooser excels at the brief, imagistic poem.\"The Kansas City Star\"Delights and Shadows raises the voice of the poet above everything else. Each short, vivid poem on the page reads as if it were being spoken aloud. Details about cemeteries, dictionaries, a doctor's waiting room, and a jar of buttons bristle with sound and awareness. Kooser's ability to use brief lyrics to compose a music of discovery and regeneration makes his work radiant and consuming... This is not an extended, complex or experimental kind of writing, but poetry that rings true, allowing the human sound of being to exist on the page.\"Bloomsbury Review\"Here is the gift and fragility of life.\"The Wichita Eagle\"Kooser is a master of the subjective description. Empathetic without sentimentality, his eye ranges over all sorts of everyday subjects and finds material everywhere wherever the unpredictable particularity of the world can be glimpsed Perhaps Kooser\u2019s success lies in his determination to see the things of this world with such clarity and passion that their underlying mysteries, delights, and shadows also become clear, if only for a moment.\"The Georgia Review\"You can almost see Kooser behind the poems, watching the world like a sketch artist Kooser displays the same kind of fluid strokes Degas used in his ballet pictures...He is an exquisite miniaturist of daily life.\"The Hartford Courant\"The poet finds magic in activities and objects typically considered mundane... Metaphors are the treasure of these short, imagistic poems, emphasizing the wonder and delight latent in what is often merely taken for granted.\"Harvard Review\"Kooser has written more perfect poems than any poet of his generation.\" Dana Gioia\"Kooser is straightforward, possesses an American essence, is humble, gritty, ironic and has a gift for detail and a deceptive simplicity.\"Seattle Post-IntelligencerAs Poet Laureate of the United States, Ted Kooser launched the weekly poetry column \"American Life in Poetry,\" which appears in over 100 newspapers nationwide.

When police and fire department personnel rush door to door in a frenzied evacuation effort, they discover the week-old corpse of an apparent suicide. But the gunshot victim is less gruesome than what they find in his lap: a photo album of seven brutally murdered young women -- one per year, for seven years. And when the suicide victim is identified as a former suspect in one of the murders, the news turns Elvis Cole's world upside down.Three years earlier Lionel Byrd was brought to trial for the murder of a female prostitute named Yvonne Bennett. A taped confession coerced by the police inspired a prominent defense attorney to take Byrd's case, and Elvis Cole was hired to investigate. It was Cole's eleventh-hour discovery of an exculpatory videotape that allowed Lionel Byrd to walk free. Elvis was hailed as a hero. But the discovery of the death album in Byrd's lap now brands Elvis as an unwitting accomplice to murder. Captured in photographs that could only have been taken by the murderer, Yvonne Bennett was the fifth of the seven victims -- two more young women were murdered after Lionel Byrd walked free. So Elvis can't help but wonder -- did he, Elvis Cole, cost two more young women their lives? Shut out of the investigation by a special LAPD task force determined to close the case, Elvis Cole and Joe Pike desperately fight to uncover the truth about Lionel Byrd and his nightmare album of death -- a truth hidden by lies, politics, and corruption in a world where nothing is what it seems to be. Chasing Darkness is a blistering thriller from the bestselling author who sets the standard for intense, powerful crime writing.",

Yes, she was Tom\u2019s childhood sweetheart, but the true story\u00a0of their love, and the dark secret that tore it apart,\u00a0never made it into Twain\u2019s novel. Now married to Tom\u2019s cousin Sid Hopkins, Becky has children of her own to protect while the men of Missouri are off fighting their \u201cun-Civil\u201d War. But when tragedy strikes at home, Becky embarks on a phenomenal quest to find her husband and save her family---a life journey that takes her from\u00a0the Mississippi River\u2019s steamboats to\u00a0Ozark rebel camps, from Nevada\u2019s silver mines to the gilded streets of San Francisco.

As she seeks\u00a0to find a compromise between fulfillment and security, she also grapples with ghosts of her past. Can she forgive herself, or be forgiven, for the lies she\u2019s told to the men she\u2019s loved? Will she ever forget the maddening, sweet-talking, irresponsible Tom Sawyer, the boy who\u00a0stole her heart as a little girl?
