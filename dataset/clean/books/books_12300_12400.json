Or perhaps it all began a dozen years before her birth - when a Greater Brazilian flyby drone was destroyed above a red dwarf star, drawing an uncomprehending human race into a thousand-millennia-old genocidal conflict that was not their own.And now Dorthy's extraordinary mental ability to touch the past and the future has made her the pawn of a wealthy immortal's vengeance - rocketing her to the black hole at the core of the galaxy, and into the perilous heart of a fanatical religious sect's relentless search for hidden gods.For it is here that the final battle must ultimately be fought against a fearsome, invisible Enemy who has harnessed the powers of creation to obliterate a universe. And it is Dorthy Yoshida who stands at the frontlines of the war for tomorrow - unknowingly possessing the answers to the mysteries of eternity...and the key to preventing the apocalyptic unraveling of space and time.",

Billions of words have been written about her, but Jackie guarded her privacy so fiercely that she remains veiled in mystery and mystique.In this much-anticipated sequel to his 1996 bestseller, Jack and Jackie, Christopher Andersen draws on previously sealed archival material and newly declassified documents - as well as important sources who have agreed to speak here for the first time - to paint a sympathetic yet often startling portrait of Jackie in all her rich complexity.",

Thank goodness, because many people who fall into managerial positions haven't the foggiest notion how to lead. They don't feel driven to attain the competencies of a boss--much less a great boss. Lorraine Monroe is a born leader. She caught the bug early, as secretary of the student council in the fourth grade at P.S. 157 in Central Harlem. She went on to found the Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, a remarkably successful and innovative public school, and became one of the most respected education reformers in America. Now Monroe translates her extensive experience in New York City public schools into the \"Monroe Doctrine\" to show other education and business leaders how to create and maintain high-achieving organizations.The Monroe Doctrine offers readers concrete lessons in the craft of leadership. Its brief, catchy lessons and anecdotes will help potential leaders tap into their natural gifts and harness those gifts to lead seemingly by instinct. Monroe's personal story of conquering the most overwhelming challenges will inspire leaders of all types to try new ideas to enrich their lives and the lives of their organizations. With The Monroe Doctrine by their side, readers will be able to lead any organization--whether a hospital, a house of worship, a sorority, a family, a school, or a business--with renewed passion and results.",

Until she meets Edward E. Gluck.Edward Gluck is a public personality, a renowned genius and group mental healer, guru to people like Helen through his famous self-help process; privately, he is painfully obsessed with masturbation and self-punishment, unable to employ his own fatuous self-help techniques to overcome his personal disgust and psychological anemia.Original Bliss tells the story of an excruciatingly awkward courtship between two soul-sick people - the one brutally shy, the other an exhibitionist - searching for a way to break out of their isolation. By turns acerbic and tender, and with remarkable economy and precision, A. L. Kennedy writes about the attempt to close emotional distances and fill physical voids, and the aching need for completion and healing.",

        "Title": "A Fire in Zion: The Israeli-Palestinian Search for Peace",
        "Authors": "By Perry, Mark",
        "Description": "A noted American journalist with unprecedented access to the major American, Israeli, and Palestinian players recounts the dramatic Middle East peace process, from 1988 until today.The historic handshake on the White House lawn on September 13, 1993, marked the most significant step toward resolving the bloody, forty-year war between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. The ceremonial reconciliation between a solemn Yasser Arafat and a reluctant Yitzhak Rabin was the result of a long and arduous process that had its roots in years of tentative contacts between the two sides.From Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to Madrid and Oslo, A Fire in Zion tells the startling story of the Israeli-Palestinian search for peace - and the searing and often tragic events that led to the peace agreement. In A Fire in Zion, Washington-based journalist Mark Perry captures for the first time the complete history of the Israeli-Palestinian accord. Spanning the period from December 1987 to the signing of the final accord on the White House lawn, the author sketches vivid portraits of the most important political and diplomatic figures of our time and the people who made peace possible: PLO chief Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, former Secretary of State James Baker, and a host of others. In each case the author was given extraordinary access to the decision-makers who brought the two antagonists to the peace table.A Fire in Zion begins where From Beirut to Jerusalem left off - revealing in timely, riveting detail how the Middle East conflict is now slowly being resolved. The author provides an incisive commentary on the divisions between American and Israeli Jews, the conflict inside the PLO, the struggle for peace inside the Israeli government, and the often vicious fights in both the Bush and Clinton administrations over just what a Middle East peace should look like.A Fire in Zion is much more than a dramatic recounting of international intrigue; it is also a saga of two very different peoples, and two dreams. Here are the often unheard voices of individual Palestinian and Israeli men, women, and children, who, in their desperate search for peace, find themselves caught in a deadly and seemingly endless conflict.This book takes the reader on a journey from Jericho in the occupied territories to Jericho, New York, from the fetid refugee camps of the Gaza Strip to the stony steps of Bethlehem, from PLO headquarters in Tunis to the halls of the Knesset.",

A cat? No, a dog. With all due apology to the cats out there, the title of this book could not be more accurate. Dogs are the most loyal of friends, the most indiscriminate of companions, and the only ones who will always adore you even when you're bad. The dogs featured here range from an Irish Wolfhound named Brennain, who opposes war, fleas, and pills, to a pug puppy named Sydney whose only dislike is reading the daily newspaperso she poops on it instead. Author Jeff Selis's tribute to our slobbery, four-legged friends urges us to follow their lead for awhile and stop thinking about traffic jams and cloudy days and alarm clocks, and instead take time to smell the floweres, the trees...the cute terrier down th street. This books of canine portraits will bring a smile even to those feline types who bitterly wish that T-A-C spelled GOD.",

And of course they were, the woods were full of everything you didn\u2019t like, everything you were afraid of and instinctively loathed, everything that tried to overwhelm you with nasty, no-brain panic.  The brochure promised a \u201cmoderate-to-difficult\u201d six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, where nine-year-old Trisha McFarland was to spend Saturday with her older brother Pete and her recently divorced mother. When she wanders off to escape their constant bickering, then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut through the woods, Trisha strays deeper into a wilderness full of peril and terror. Especially when night falls.  Trisha has only her wits for navigation, only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fear. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games and the gritty performances of her hero, number thirty-six, relief pitcher Tom Gordon. And when her radio\u2019s reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her\u2014her key to surviving an enemy known only by the slaughtered animals and mangled trees in its wake.",

And after months of trying to find a little romance on New York's wild singles circuit, she was ready to give up, reconciled to just raising her two great, but outspoken, kids. Then a spur-of-the-moment trip to Paris changed everything. She met him on the Left Bank. Peter Baker was a marvelously handsome high-tech entrepreneur also visiting the city. Stephanie was certain it couldn't possibly work. Peter was just too perfect. But much to her amazement, he contacted her when they returned to New York. And at the Long Island rental cottage she shared with her kids, Stephanie embarked on a bizarre and hilarious adventure beyond her wildest dreams. Shy, serious Peter, chairman of a bionic enterprise, was supposed to be away on business. Instead, he's standing at her door, wearing day-glo satin and rhinestones. Naturally, Stephanie thinks it's a joke--until the truth suddenly dawns: this isn't Peter playing a role. This is his double! Calling himself Paul Klone, this wild, uninhibited creature isn't even remotely like Peter except for his identically sexy good looks. This uproarious novel explores the outrageous love triangle that develops between Stephanie, Peter...and the Klone.In a wickedly funny, right-on-target look at finding the perfect mate in an imperfect world, bestselling novelist Danielle Steel reveals insights into the human heart that have made her novels #1 bestsellers around the world.",

For one thing, pretty is available to anyone who has the time, energy, money, and will.  And even without exercise or makeup, I considered myself to be serviceably attractive.  I elicit a grunt from workmen.  Baggers at the supermarket, however, called me ma'am.\"Meet Francesca Greenfield, a smart, urban professional suddenly tossed out of her so-so career and into the business of selling coffee alongside her pretty, perky sister Amanda.But selling coffee is only the start of their worries.Francesca has always known that she was the smart sister, \"though our mother never set us down and said, 'Francesca, we'll call you the smart one.'\"  Amanda was soft and lovely from the beginning and had always garnered most of the attention-and all of the dates.  Now they've been thrown together in a last-ditch effort to save the family business before it goes permanently down the drain.As for the coffeehouse itself, well, there's rarely a dull moment.  Consider the piranha-minded next-door franchise and the brainstorms of one nearly psychotic marketing manager for starters.  And who can forget about love?  Or at least sex.  Thanks to a promotional contest, it's not long before Amanda is looking to explore the aura of a buff mountain climber while Francesca considers shedding more than her inhibitions with a J. Crew model.The stakes are rising.  It's time to find out if smart or pretty knows best, whether the distinction really suits either one of them, and if the Greenfield sisters can actually live happily ever after.",

Perhaps because the St. Leger legacy of strange powers is most pronounced in Lance's own dubious gift. He calls it night drifting - his ability to separate his body from his soul, to spirit into the night while flesh and bone remain behind. And it is on one wild night's mad search for a magnificent stolen sword - the icon of St. Leger power - that he finds her....Rosalind, a young, sheltered widow with a passion for the Arthurian legend, mistakes Lance's \"drifting\" soul for the ghost of Sir Lancelot.But deep down in her heart, Rosalind is all too aware she is a mortal woman with very real desires that only a man of flesh and blood can fulfill - a man like Lance St. Leger. The scandal-plagued scoundrel teases and tempts her, fills her with a yearning her chivalrous phantom knight cannot satisfy. And in this place imbued with both true love and otherworldly magic, where blood ties run as deep as eternity, a new dire portent vows to come full circle. As a murderous enemy challenges the St. Leger power, Rosalind must tempt magic herself to save her beloved from the cold depths of eternal damnation.",

Does TV have too much control over college basketball? What about the big business that Division I college basketball has become? Do coaches really deserve the money they make? Should the players get something for all their hard work? In Holding Court: Reflections on the Game I Love, Vitale hits on all of these subjects and more.",

But that is precisely what Arthur C.

Clarke\u2019s 2010: Odyssey Two\u00a0enthralled a huge audience worldwide.Now, in 2061: Odyssey Three, Arthur C. Clarke revisits the most famous future ever imagined, as two expeditions into space are inextricably tangled by human necessity and the immutable laws of physics. And Heywood Floyd, survivor of two previous encounters with the mysterious monoliths, must once again confront Dave Bowman\u2014or whatever Bowman has become\u2014a newly independent HAL, and the power of an alien race that has decided Mankind is to play a part in the evolution of the galaxy whether it wishes to or not.",

But Mary has known freedom, and having never known love, it is freedom that motivates her. Mary asks herself if the prostitute who hires out her body is more or less free than the \"honest woman\" locked into marriage, or the servant who runs a household not her own? And is either as free as a man? Ultimately, Mary remains true only to the three rules she learned on the streets: Never give up your liberty. Clothes make the woman.
