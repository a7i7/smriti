        "Description": "Color is interior design\u2019s hardest-working tool.It\u2019s the one element that can alter our mood, influence the way we see space, camouflage imperfections, give us an instant taste of drama or serenity.  Paint is the easiest, most effective, and most inexpensive way of achieving those effects -- the quickest, most powerful way to transform any room. But sifting through hundreds or thousands of color chips in the paint store can be daunting.  You can start with your favorite colors, or copy a scheme you saw at a neighbor\u2019s house, or play it safe and stay with the same color you already have, but that doesn\u2019t always guarantee decorating success.  In Interior Style, the experts at Benjamin Moore share more than 100 years of know-how and advice on what does generate success.  Chapter by chapter, color family by color family, Interior Style explains how anyone can master the art of using color.  Rich photographs of interiors take the guesswork our of choosing a palette and pairing colors because each is matched to specific Benjamin Moore paints.   Interior Style explores the properties of color; how it behaves in both natural and artificial light; how colors look next to one another -- within a room, from room to room, or in conjunction with furnishings; how to incorporate neutrals, whites and off-whites without becoming bland; how to use extreme, bold colors without being overpowered; how any other color palette can be used in your home.  Plus, in a special how-to section Benjamin Moore\u2019s technical experts share their practical know-how.",

        "Title": "When God & Cancer Meet",
        "Authors": "By Eib, Lynn and Jackson, Lisa A. (EDT)",
        "Description": "A book of powerful stories about cancer patients and their families who have been touched by God in miraculous ways\u2014some in their bodies, others in their minds, all in their spirits\u2014offers inspiring testimony that, when God and cancer meet, cancer is conquered. The author, herself a cancer survivor, gives us a behind-the-scenes glimpse of 18 personal encounters with God.Here\u2019s what others are saying about When God & Cancer Meet: \u201cLynn has captured the essence of hope in this book; captured hope in ways that I have always taught in my professional world as well as in my spiritual community. This book is a treasure to those who struggle with the fears of cancer and I want to keep it close at hand for those reasons.\u201d \u2014Judy Lentz, RN, MSN, OCN, NHA; Executive Director, Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association\u201cI co-lead a cancer support group at my church, and we have been looking for \u2018just the right book\u2019 to study and discuss. Guess what?! Lyn wrote it! I was truly touched by all the stories; of course being a cancer-survivor myself, I saw myself in one of the stories, as if Lyn were writing my own personal story. I was truly impressed with the way she incorporated scripture, and God\u2019s viewpoint into every story. I think that is of utmost importance for anyone facing this disease. Lyn\u2019s book is \u2018Real-Life\u2019; some quickly are healed of the cancer, some deal with it over a prolonged period, some deal with recurrences, some, mercifully, die rather quickly. I share Lyn\u2019s belief that GOD sometimes chooses to heal in different ways: physically, emotionally and spiritually. In the process of surviving a primary brain tumor, surgery, Chemo, and radiation, I gave my life to Christ, realizing that my physical health was not GOD\u2019s main concern, my Spiritual health was the biggest victim of a disease that needed attention and this was the way He FINALLY got my attention. Lyn\u2019s book alludes to this fact in every one of her stories. In this day and age that we are living, where it is against the rules to even mention GOD (unless we mention His name in vain) it is refreshing to have a book written, praising Him for His care and concern for us; written by a woman who has experienced the disease firsthand, and continues to minister to others with cancer, and to work for a Doctor! who isn\u2019t ashamed of his Faith! WOW!! Obviously, Lyn\u2019s book has my highest reccomendation, and my support group will be purchasing multple copies, and we plan to invite Lyn to speak with us. Lyn is a wonderful person, and I thank God for allowing our paths to cross. I\u2019m sure this book will touch many lives, and give many a new perspective and hope with their cancer.\u201d \u2014Chris Winand, cancer survivor",

In fact, dual-income couples with children now make up the majority of American families and, according to a million-dollar study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, these families are really getting it right: men are sharing the burdens of parenting and housework, women are much happier when they balance careers and child-rearing, and daycare has become a truly positive option for both parents and children.Exploring the results of the NIMH study and hundreds of others, Radcliffe psychologist Rosalind Barnett and journalist Caryl Rivers debunk the myth that modern families are walking time bombs by taking us inside the new American family. Tackling all the major issues facing families today, including stress, child-care, career problems, moral values, money, free time, and the quality of couples' relationships, Barnett and Rivers show how dual-income households create economic stability and a close-knit, cooperative family atmosphere.",
