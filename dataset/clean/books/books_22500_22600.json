Now Harold Kushner discovers what it has to teach us about living our day-to-day lives. Each chapter discusses one line of the psalm in the context of both the time when it was written and the present day, and illuminates the life lessons contained within it. For example, Kushner shows us that the phrase \u201cMy cup runneth over\u201d is a declaration of our gratitude for what life has given us and a rejection of the envy we may feel for what others have. And he draws on the ideas and thoughts of various spiritual figures\u2013from G. K. Chesterton to Martin Buber to Paul Tillich\u2013to further expand our understanding of this great psalm and help us benefit from its everyday spiritual wisdom.",

        "Title": "The Orphaned Capital: Adopting the Right Revenues for the District of Columbia",
        "Authors": "By O'Cleireacain, Carol",
        "Description": "The nation's capital is in a fiscal and political crisis. By 1995 the District of Columbia did not have the cash to pay its bills and faced a growing operating deficit. It was effectively shut out of the capital markets and at least three of its government agencies were in receivership. On any given day, 30 percent of the police vehicles were in the shop for repairs and 25 percent of the school buses were inoperable. Nor were adequate funds coming in: property assessors were making up the rules as they were undervaluing the tax base. In April 1995 Congress, beginning to come to grips with the situation, placed the fiscal control of the city in the hands of a presidentially appointed Control Board.  The survival of the nation's capital is a matter of national concern. The Control Board and the chief financial officer have outlined the path to balancing the budget by 1999. Once the District government can deliver services efficiently, the issue of how they should be financed will need to be addressed. That is the focus of this book.  Carol O'Cleireacain provides background for understanding the present situation, focusing on the revenue components and offering a realistic menu of revenue options for long-term, ongoing budget balance. She addresses such questions as: What is the \"norm\" for a city the size of Washington? What is the appropriate sharing among the federal government, District residents, and the region? How much compensation should be paid for the huge amount of tax-exempt property and the enormous number of nonprofit organizations in the capital? What taxes can the District impose fairly, collect efficiently without distorting decisions of individuals and businesses about where to locate?  O'Cleireacain concludes that the District's fiscal crisis is the result, in part, of economic and demographic trends reflecting the dilemmas of central cities and their suburbs nationwide; in part, the historically flawed relationship between Congress and the local government. But at the heart of the District's fiscal crisis is its special status as the nation's capital. All other American cities benefit from state aid for welfare, Medicaid, prisons, higher education, juvenile justice, and a wide range of highway, infrastructure, and other capital investments. The District does not; it has to tax its residents in order to provide state-type services. Ongoing budget balance in D.C. will require a realignment of spending and revenue responsibilities by the federal government acting as the state parent to the nation's orphaned capital.",

        "Description": "When Blinking Jack Stokes met Ruby Pitt Woodrow, she was twenty and he was forty. She was the carefully raised daughter of Carolina gentry and he was a skinny tenant farmer who had never owned anything in his life. She was newly widowed after a disastrous marriage to a brutal drifter. He had never asked a woman to do more than help him hitch a mule. They didn't fall in love so much as they simply found each other and held on for dear life.Kaye Gibbons's first novel, Ellen Foster, won the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and the praise of writers from Walker Percy to Eudora Welty. In A Virtuous Woman, Gibbons transcends her early promise, creating a multilayered and indelibly convincing portrait of two seemingly ill-matched people who somehow miraculously make a marriage.",

Grace Marks has been convicted for her involvement in the vicious murders of her employer, the wealthy Thomas Kinnear, and of Nancy Montgomery, his housekeeper and mistress. Some believe Grace is innocent; others think her evil or insane. Now serving a life sentence after a stint in Toronto's lunatic asylum, Grace herself claims to have no memory of the murders.Dr. Simon Jordan, an up-and-coming expert in the burgeoning field of mental illness, is engaged by a group of reformers and spiritualists who seek a pardon for Grace. He listens to her story, from her family's difficult passage out of Ireland into Canada, to her time as a maid in Thomas Kinnear's household. As he brings Grace closer and closer to the day she cannot remember, he hears of the turbulent relationship between Kinnear and Nancy Montgomery, and of the alarming behavior of Grace's fellow servant, James McDermott. Jordan is drawn to Grace, but he is also baffled by her. What will he find in attempting to unlock her memories? Is Grace a female fiend, a bloodthirsty femme fatale? Or is she a victim of circumstances?",

Ian Frazier takes the F train to Brooklyn, with its continuous parade of urban surprises; Amitav Ghosh visits New Delhi during a moment of social upheaval; and Chang-Rae Lee welcomes us into his family kitchen, where he prepares Korean meals for his dying mother. While Gerald Early analyzes the Afrocentric dream of a world without whites, Jonathan Raban hears \" the last call of the wild\" on the Pacific coast, and Nicholson Baker peruses an upscale world in which books are part of the furniture. Guest editor Geoffrey C. Ward has assembled an outstanding group of essays with a slightly different twist - one that looks outside instead of in.",

        "Description": "Herman Wouk is one of this century's great historical novelists, whose peerless talent for capturing the human drama of landmark world events has earned him worldwide acclaim. In The Hope, his long-awaited return to historical fiction, he turns to one of the most thrilling stories of our time - the saga of Israel.In the grand, epic style of The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, The Hope plunges the reader into the major battles, the disasters and victories, and the fragile periods of peace from the 1948 War of Independence to the astounding triumph of the Six-Day War in 1967. And since Israelis have seen their share of comic mishaps as well as heroism, this novel offers some of Herman Wouk's most amusing scenes since the famed \"strawberry business\" in The Caine Mutiny.First to last The Hope is a tale of four Israeli army officers and the women they love: Zev Barak, Viennese-born cultured military man; Benny Luria, ace fighter pilot with religious stirrings; Sam Pasternak, sardonic and mysterious Mossad man; and an antic dashing warrior they call Kishote, Hebrew for Quixote, who arrives at Israel's first pitched battle a refugee boy on a mule and over the years rises to high rank. In the love stories of these four men, the author of Marjorie Morningstar has created a gallery of three memorable Israeli women and one quirky fascinating American, daughter of a high CIA official and headmistress of a Washington girls school.With the authenticity, authority, and narrative force of Wouk's finest fiction, The Hope portrays not so much the victory of one people over another, as the gallantry of the human spirit, surviving and triumphing against crushing odds. In that sense it can be called a tale of hope for all mankind; a note that Herman Wouk has struck in all his writings, against the prevailing pessimism of our turbulent century.",

In Eats, Shoots & Leaves, former editor Lynne Truss dares to say, in her delightfully urbane, witty, and very English way, that it is time to look at our commas and semicolons and see them as the wonderful and necessary things they are. This is a book for people who love punctuation and get upset when it is mishandled. From the invention of the question mark in the time of Charlemagne to George Orwell shunning the semicolon, this lively history makes a powerful case for the preservation of a system of printing conventions that is much too subtle to be mucked about with.",

And that he continued to do so through every twist and turn of his career, from art expert to archaeologist, to journalist and author, right up until his death in 1989. These previously neglected or unpublished pieces - short stories, travel sketches, essays, articles, and criticism - gathered together here for the first time, cover every period and aspect of the writer's career, and reflect the abiding themes of his work: roots and rootlessness, exile and the exotic, possession and renunciation.",

        "Description": "When Anne Frahm discovered she had cancer, it had already spread from her breast to her shoulder, ribs, skull, and pelvic bone, and had eaten into every vertebrae in her spine.Doctors prescribed the traditional treatments of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but Anne continued to sicken. Yet, throughout the course of her disease the author persisted in researching the connection between cancer and nutrition. She formulated a comprehensive battle plan and within five weeks of implementing it, her cancer disappeared without a trace. She has been cancer-free ever since.As A Cancer Battle Plantakes us along on Anne Frahm's journey of reclaiming her body and health, we learn:the nutritional rebuilding process that can help us win the war against cancer;how specific preventive measures can neutralize cancer and other degenerative diseases;how to find a team of doctors and professionals that will help battle cancer most successfully;how to encourage and help someone fight cancer; andhow to keep a fighting spirit and maintain morale.With a new introduction by the author, A Cancer Battle Plan is a riveting account that has helped tens of thousands and is an invaluable nutritional program for anyone wishing to recover or perpetuate their good health.",

And what month did the new hair come in across your ears? A tongue-in-cheek celebration of middle age in the form of a traditional fill-in baby book, my middle-aged baby book is a perfect keepsake for both women (\"Is it hot in here or is it just me?\") and men (\"remember, it's prostate, not prostrate\"). It's an irreverent take on the shared symptoms of growing older. Beginning with vital statistics (car phone number, cholesterol count), it provides a permanent place to record memorable Firsts--first liver spot, first espousal of conservative opinions-and a place to remember favorite toys such as the Jeep, rowing machine, and the big screen TV with VCR. There's a middle-aged baby's Horoscope, Favorite Nursery Rhymes, and The Seven Stages on Men's Hair Loss. Thoughtfully printed on anti-glare paper, in large, easy-to-read type, the book is illustrated throughout in full color. Paper over board, Full-color illustration throughout, 96 pages, 8\" x 8\" .",

        "Description": "A compelling indictment of the Bush Administration's cynical, anti-democratic manipulation of the mediaIn this devastating analysis of American politics today, a former Democratic campaign advisor pulls back the curtain on the pervasive political manipulation of the media-and reveals just how fragile our democracy is. From political ads and talk shows to mainstream media reporting, Glenn Smith shows how American political discourse is now dominated by carefully scripted images and rhetoric-most of which benefit the Republicans and their corporate allies. The result is public apathy toward politics-and a real threat to American freedom.To reclaim our nation, Smith argues, we must revitalize politics at the grassroots level-and liberals must realize that religion and spirituality are not antithetical to a progressive agenda. For anyone troubled by manipulative political advertising, self-aggrandizing celebrity pundits, and the undiminished role of money in politics, this necessary book lays out the full scope of the problem-and points the way toward solutions.Glenn Smith (Austin, TX), a former journalist and political consultant, managed MoveOn.org's Defending Democracy Campaign.

        "Title": "State of Grace: A Memoir of Twilight Time",
        "Authors": "By Timberg, Robert",
        "Description": "From the author of the critically acclaimed The Nightingale's Song (\"An amazing piece of work...This is a stunning book\" -- Boston Globe), comes an evocative, elegiac and rollicking portrait of America.  The Nightingale's Song was Robert Timberg's extraordinary tale of well-intentioned but ill-starred warriors. In State of Grace, his long-awaited new book, he revives the powerful themes of courage, manhood and loss in a strikingly personal exploration of America between the Good War and Vietnam. \"It was the twilight of innocence, or what passed for innocence if you didn't look too closely,\" he writes. \"America was at peace, peering confidently into the future, when it should have been holding its breath for what lay ahead.\"  Robert Timberg has his finger on the pulse of a generation that split along a fault line called Vietnam, between those who went and those who didn't. In his unflinching and riveting The Nightingale's Song, Timberg chronicled a nation haunted by the war and its corrosive aftermath. Now, in State of Grace, the author rediscovers an earlier time and an America now largely lost.  Using the New York City sandlot football team he played for after high school as a rich metaphor for what was best about that bygone era, Timberg evokes the period in fine detail and vivid color. It was a world of girls, beer and the proverbial Big Game, but it also was defined by faith in tradition and institutions, including a still unsullied Catholic Church. State of Grace captures life on the threshold of Kennedy's Camelot, before the Beatles, before the Pill, but in the ever-expanding shadow of Vietnam, \"a time when the path to an honorable future seemed as straightforward as playing hard, hitting clean, and not fumbling the ball.\"  The tale is told through Timberg's own eyes as he moves from troubled youth to man, from running back on a team called the Lynvets to Naval Academy plebe to Marine officer. The story is also told through a collection of other characters, including a genius of a coach overmatched when off the field, a driven quarterback sidetracked by booze and an angry loner fresh from the army stockade who reclaims his life on the gridiron. As Timberg writes, the team was where he and his fellow Lynvets \"found a toe-hold on our better selves during a troubled time in our lives. Those snatches of pride and courage and strength we shared...eventually grew within us, becoming the core of a decent manhood that might have easily eluded any one of us in other circumstances. There were times, for each of us, when it was all we had.\"",

        "Title": "The Corporate Closet: The Professional Lives of Gay Men in America",
        "Authors": "By Woods, James D. and Lucas, Jay H.",
        "Description": "While most of us believe that professional conduct is, or should be, asexual, corporate America is in fact suffused with sexual assumptions. From its offices to its boardrooms, heterosexuality is continuously on display: alluded to in conversation and family photos, symbolized by wedding rings, and endorsed by personnel policies that award benefits to spouses and children. For the estimated ten percent of the population that is gay, including the millions of gay professionals in the corporate world, the \"sexual culture\" of these organizations forces a series of difficult choices.Now, drawing on hundreds of interviews with men all across the country and in different kinds of companies, from chief executives to recent college graduates, James Woods explores the professional lives of gay men and the various strategies they have developed for managing sexual identity at work. Whether they disguise their sexuality, reveal it, or try to avoid the subject altogether, each choice has its consequences and benefits and has profound implications for their careers, their companies, and their colleagues. This pathbreaking book explores the significance of each alternative, and in tracing the process by which gay men make the choice it illuminates the stressful realities of gay life in corporate America.In the short run, it is the men's self-esteem, productivity, and job satisfaction that suffer from the struggle of accommodating to heterosexual norms. But in the long run, the sexual culture of the workplace affects all professionals. Woods' fascinating inquiry explores the dynamics of sexuality in professional life and the way it shapes our own self-definitions, values, and most deeply held ideas about work. As the workplace becomes increasingly diverse, it is time for us to look more closely at the boundaries between the sexual and the professional, and the many ways in which these worlds overlap.",

        "Authors": "By St. John, Bob",
        "Description": "From his unique vantage point as the dean of Dallas sports writers, Bob St. John brings us a soul-stirring portrait of one of America's most loved heroes-Tom Landry-who was, for twenty-nine years, the Dallas Cowboys' only head coach.Recounting Landry's phenomenal rise to coaching fame, St. John gives us glimpses of Landry as the intramural champion in light heavyweight boxing at the University of Texas, the decorated military veteran, the rugged college halfback, and the dedicated husband and father of a family that mattered more to him than any of his legendary football teams.For years St. John covered the Cowboys for the Dallas Morning News. So he brings to these pages a wealth of inside tales and touching vignettes of the coach who made them \"America's team.\" As he traces the Cowboys' illustrious history to show us Tom Landry in action, St. John chroniclesThose first agonizing years when the talent-poor Cowboys got pulverized by tough NFL teamsThe incredible ten-year coaching contract Murchison awarded to Landry after his first four humiliating seasonsThe first glimmerings of glory when Don Meredith, Bob Lilly, Mel Renfro, Lee Roy Jordan, and Walt Garrision became household namesThe Glory years-the Staubach years-with back-to-back Super Bowl contending teamsThe dog-days at the end of Landry's coaching career when the NFL's parity rules depleted the Cowboy's arsenal once moreThe seismic shock in Dallas when the team's new owner fired the world's favorite coachThousands gathered to honor \"the man in the hat\" shortly before he died. Former President George Bush said to him, \"You're an inspiration to all who have ever watched or played the game of football.\" St. John recalls that moment: \"As Landry walked off the speaker's stand it would be the last time most people would ever see him. That familiar face that seemed to be chiseled in stone with deep-set, pale eyes that could almost become slits when he smiled or deeply concentrated the chine that jutted out would become a fading memory. And then Landry walked away and was gone.\"But he has not been forgotten.",

As a man, he has made its exploration his life's work, tirelessly writing mysteries set in gaslight New York, a world of mists and shadows, of voices pleading in the fog, footsteps racing over rain-swept cobblestones...a world colored by the ache of Grave's own past, its still-remembered screams.It is a far cry from Riverwood, the artists' community in upstate New York where Graves is invited to spend the summer. And yet, for all its splendor and grand isolation, Riverwood was once touched by crime - the murder of Faye Harrison, a teenage girl who'd lived on the estate fifty years before. Faye's mother is now dying, but uneasily, still tormented by the unanswered questions about her daughter's death. Graves has been summoned by Allison Davies, Faye's girlhood friend and now Riverwood's owner, and asked to explore this long-past crime, apply the art of mystery fiction to a murder that was real, then write a story that will answer those very questions that keep Faye's mother from a peaceful death.",

        "Title": "Writing for Social Scientists: How to Start and Finish Your Thesis, Book, or Article (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)",
        "Authors": "By Becker, Howard S.",
        "Description": "Social scientists, whether earnest graduate students or tenured faculty members, clearly know the rules that govern good writing. But for some reason they choose to ignore those guidelines and churn out turgid, pompous, and obscure prose. Distinguished sociologist Howard S. Becker, true to his calling, looks for an explanation for this bizarre behavior not in the psyches of his colleagues but in the structure of his profession. In this highly personal and inspirational volume he considers academic writing as a social activity.Both the means and the reasons for writing a thesis or article or book are socially structured by the organization of graduate study, the requirements for publication, and the conditions for promotion, and the pressures arising from these situations create the writing style so often lampooned and lamented. Drawing on his thirty-five years' experience as a researcher, writer, and teacher, Becker exposes the foibles of the academic profession to the light of sociological analysis and gentle humor. He also offers eminently useful suggestions for ways to make social scientists better and more productive writers. Among the topics discussed are how to overcome the paralyzing fears of chaos and ridicule that lead to writer's block; how to rewrite and revise, again and again; how to adopt a persona compatible with lucid prose; how to deal with that academic bugaboo, \"the literature.\" There is also a chapter by Pamela Richards on the personal and professional risks involved in scholarly writing.In recounting his own trials and errors Becker offers his readers not a model to be slavishly imitated but an example to inspire. Throughout, his focus is on the elusive work habits that contribute to good writing, not the more easily learned rules of grammar and punctuation. Although his examples are drawn from sociological literature, his conclusions apply to all fields of social science, and indeed to all areas of scholarly endeavor. The message is clear: you don't have to write like a social scientist to be one.",

Set in colonial Algeria, and in the south of France and New England, it is the tale of the LaBasse family, whose quiet integrity is shattered by the shots from a grandfather&#39;s rifle. As their world suddenly begins to crumble, long-hidden shame emerges: a son abandoned by the family before he was even born, a mother whose identity is not what she has claimed, a father whose act of defiance brings Hotel Bellevue--the family business--to its knees. Messud skillfully and inexorably describes how the stories we tell ourselves, and the lies to which we cling, can turn on us in a moment.",

Years later, Michael is living a life devoted to music, until one day he is riding a London bus, and there, on another bus, separated only by glass, sits Julia McNicholl.Though the mutual passion flares anew, the love they shared in their younger days is now complicated by the secrets and silences that have been generated by the passing of years. Unable to resist the power of their shared history, however, Julia agrees to tour Vienna and Venice with Michael and the Maggiore Quartet. Against the magical backdrop of concert halls and canals, Michael and Julia must confront the truth about their love for one another, their love for the music that brought them together, and the true consequences for their tangled hearts.",
