We are bombarded with suggestions concerning what awaits us when we cross the line from life to death.  Is it as Betty Eadie claims, an eternal existence of peaceful and loving acceptance?  Or could it be as Shirley MacLaine insists, simply reincarnation - a transfer from one body to another? We need not play this guessing game, wondering what will greet us on the other side - the Bible tells us that we can know for sure.  For some, it will be a beautiful existence of eternal bliss; for others, an everlasting experience of pain and torment.  And there will ever be a great gulf fixed between the two. The only question that remains is . . .which side will you be on?In One Minute After You Die Dr. Lutzer clearly enunciates what the Bible has to say about the life beyond.  With biblical descriptions of the splendor of heaven and the horrors of hell, he authoritatively dispels fears for those who have placed their trust in Jesus Christ and presents the dread necessity for those who have yet to believe.  Many who read it will be comforted;  others will be disturbed;  and everyone will be instructed. Each day is one step closer to eternity.  Are you ready?<br>",

Torn by internal conflict and with many of its members alienated, the Church faces one of the most serious crises in its history. A coalition of cardinals favors a more moderate and pluralistic style of papal governance, but must contend with shadowy Vatican forces that oppose change and loss of their own power. These forces are determined to destory the coalition's candidate, a gentle and brilliant Spanish scholar. The leader of the coalition is Chicago's wily Sean Cardinal Cronin, aided by his patently indispensable sidekick, Bishop John Blackwood \"Blackie\" Ryan.\u00a0A lone assassin stalks the Vatican, his crazed mission: to destroy the next pope as soon as the traditional white smoke issues from the cardinals' meeting room--the Sistine Chapel--followed by the ancient words Habemus papam.\u00a0Can politics--Chicago style--turn the Catholic Church around? What will happen when the next pope must be chosen? Only Andrew M. Greeley, priest, bestselling novelist, and respected sociologist could have written this blockbuster tale of the forces actually ripping the Church apart, and of the next papal election, when the fate of the entire Catholic Church itself may well hang in the balance.",

Now, as a fearless Washinton Post reporter digging into a corruption case, she discovers the truth: Twenty years ago, before he became a senator, a young Michael Gleason ruined the career and life of her father, Tom, a public prosecutor on the rise.Today Tom Redmon has bottomed out as a low-rent attorney taking on unwinnable cases and as a widower living in an alcoholic fog and a crumbling house overlooking a lake. No one believes in him except his daughter and his 300-pound best, and only, friend - a reformed motorcycle gang member and computer whiz, Mike Tubbs.Then Jane disappears.When the D.C. police suspect a kidnapping, Redmon doesn't have to look at a list of suspects. As a former cop, he also knows that after the first 48 hours, victims disappear forever. Even as he jumps into his battered old pickup with Tubbs and heads into Washington, the countdown has already started.In D.C., Redmon learns his daughter was last seen following a handsome attorney with sharp green eyes who promised secret files filled with the stuff Pulitzers are made of. But the labyrinth that is Washington cannot compare to the twisted trail Redmon and Tubbs will follow five hundred miles north, to a remote island in New York State where Jane has either fallen in love or is about to lose her life.The clock is running down, and Tom doesn't know whom to trust, including himself. Is he fighting the battle he's been waiting for - or still tilting at windmills?",

        "Description": "?With good judgment, little else matters. Without it, nothing else matters.\u201d Whether we\u2019re talking about United States presidents, CEOs, Major League coaches, or wartime generals, leaders are remembered for their best and worst judgment calls. In the face of ambiguity, uncertainty, and conflicting demands, the quality of a leader\u2019s judgment determines the fate of the entire organization. That\u2019s why judgment is the essence of leadership. Yet despite its importance, judgment has always been a fairly murky concept. The leadership literature has been conspicuously quiet on what, exactly, defines it. Does judgment differ from common sense or gut instinct? Is it a product of luck? Of smarts? Or is there a process for making consistently good calls? Noel Tichy and Warren Bennis have each spent decades studying and teaching leadership and advising top CEOs such as Jack Welch and Howard Schultz. Now, in their first collaboration, they offer a powerful framework for making tough calls when the stakes are high and the right path is far from obvious. They show how to recognize the critical moment before a judgment call, when swift and decisive action is essential, and also how to execute a decision after the call. Tichy and Bennis bring their three-dimensional model to life with interviews with world-class leaders who have thrived or suffered because of their judgment calls. These stories include:         Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric, whose judgment to grow through research and development transformed GE into the world\u2019s premier technology growth company.        Joel Klein, chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, who made tough calls about teachers, students, and parents while turning around a troubled school system.        Jim McNerney, CEO of Boeing, whose strategic judgment helped him reinvigorate his company and restore a culture of trust and respect.        The late general Wayne Downing, who found an unexpected opportunity in the midst of crisis when he led the Special Operations raid to capture Manuel Noriega.        A. G. Lafley, CEO of Procter & Gamble, who bet $57 billion to purchase Gillette and reinvent his company.        Brad Anderson, CEO of Best Buy, who made the call to commit totally to a customer-centric strategy and led his people to execute it.  Whether you\u2019re running a small department or a global corporation, Judgment will give you a framework for evaluating any situation, making the call, and correcting if necessary during the execution phase. It will show you how to handle the overlapping domains of people, strategy, and crisis management. And it will help you teach your entire team to make the right call more often. No organization can afford to neglect this crucial discipline?and no previous book has ever brought it into such clear focus.",

A rare insight into the conflict from the point of view of a Confederate army enlisted man, this compelling memoir has been hailed by historians as a classic and indispensible key to understanding the Southern perspective.  Margaret Mitchell even described it as her single most valuable source of research for Gone With the Wind.This stunning document is the work of a common foot soldier blessed with extraordinary perception and articulateness.  After joining the famed Texas Brigade under Stonewall Jackson.  Private William A. Fletcher saw action at Second Manassas, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Channcellorsville, and Chickamauga.  He was wounded several times and escaped from a moving Union prison train before the South's surrender.  In 1907, he published this powerfully evocative account of his exploits, a volume of frank, detailed recollections that spares none of the horror, courage, or absurdity of war.  But a fire destroyed all but a few copies before they could be distributed.  One copy, however, did make its way to the Library of Congress, where it was eventually discovered.  Today, this colorful work has become the voice of the Civil War front-line grunt, speaking to the modern reader with the intensity of personal experience and a vividness of detail that gives it a riveting you-are-there quality.",

        "Authors": "By Reich, Christopher",
        "Description": "Hailed as \u201cthe John Grisham of Wall Street\u201d by the New York Times, Christopher Reich returns to the world he knows so well--the dangerous, dazzling world of high finance and international intrigue. In this ingeniously crafted thriller, the bestselling author of Numbered Account and The First Billion introduces his most complex and engaging hero yet: forensic accountant Adam Chapel--and paints a frightening scenario where terrorism is big business and money is the ultimate weapon of war\u2026The explosion that shatters the smart Parisian apartment reverberates around the globe. In an instant, a suspected terrorist is dead and half a million dollars has vanished. Within days, the CIA is certain it has found a connection between the dead man and a planned terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Determined to avert another 9/11, they have assembled an elite counterterrorist task force, code name: Blood Money. Its mission: to follow the money trail. Its secret weapon: forensic accountant Adam Chapel.  A man who trusts numbers more than people, Chapel has his own reasons for wanting to get the job done-- four of his colleagues were killed in the Paris blast.  Now Chapel is thrust back into the line of fire when he teams up with British intelligence agent Sarah Churchill.  The two are assigned to hunt down a shadowy mastermind who is moving vast sums of money from country to country, from bank to bank, leaving no tracks--as he prepares for an Armaggedon of his own devising. As Chapel follows a disappearing money trail from Paris to Munich to the deserts of Saudi Arabia, Sarah uses her elite training to stalk the \u201cshadow\u201d and his elusive network.  Meanwhile, their quarry is auditing their every move, laying a twisting trail of false clues and shocking surprises. With the clock ticking down, soon Chapel and Sarah have only days, hours, minutes to avert disaster as a master terrorist plots to unleash the first strike in a brilliantly orchestrated conspiracy--with an almost unimaginable goal. Hurtling us from the winding alleys of Pakistan to the elite banking houses of Europe, The Devil\u2019s Banker creates an adrenaline-fueled world where following the money has never been more dangerous, and evil has never been harder to unmask.",

        "Title": "Drawn with the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War",
        "Authors": "By McPherson, James M.",
        "Description": "James M. McPherson is acclaimed as one of the finest historians writing today and a preeminent commentator on the Civil War.  Battle Cry of Freedom, his Pulitzer Prize-winning account of that conflict, was a national bestseller that Hugh Brogan, in The New York Times, called \"history writing of the highest order.\" Now, in Drawn With the Sword, McPherson offers a series of thoughtful and engaging essays on some of the most enduring questions of the Civil War, written in the masterful prose that has become his trademark.Filled with fresh interpretations, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, Drawn With the Sword explores such questions as why the North won and why the South lost (emphasizing the role of contingency in the Northern victory), whether Southern or Northern aggression began the war, and who really freed the slaves, Abraham Lincoln or the slaves themselves. McPherson offers memorable portraits of the great leaders who people the landscape of the Civil War: Ulysses S. Grant, struggling to write his memoirs with the same courage and determination that marked his successes on the battlefield; Robert E. Lee, a brilliant general and a true gentleman, yet still a product of his time and place; and Abraham Lincoln, the leader and orator whose mythical figure still looms large over our cultural landscape. And McPherson discusses often-ignored issues such as the development of the Civil War into a modern \"total war\" against both soldiers and civilians, and the international impact of the American Civil War in advancing the cause of republicanism and democracy in countries from Brazil and Cuba to France and England. Of special interest is the final essay, entitled \"What's the Matter With History?\", a trenchant critique of the field of history today, which McPherson describes here as \"more and more about less and less.\" He writes that professional historians have abandoned narrative history written for the greater audience of educated general readers in favor of impenetrable tomes on minor historical details which serve only to edify other academics, thus leaving the historical education of the general public to films and television programs such as Glory and Ken Burns's PBS documentary The Civil War.Each essay in Drawn With the Sword reveals McPherson's own profound knowledge of the Civil War and of the controversies among historians, presenting all sides in clear and lucid prose and concluding with his own measured and eloquent opinions. Readers will rejoice that McPherson has once again proven by example that history can be both accurate and interesting, informative and well-written. Mark Twain wrote that the Civil War \"wrought so profoundly upon the entire national character that the influence cannot be measured short of two or three generations.\" In Drawn With the Sword, McPherson gracefully and brilliantly illuminates this momentous conflict.",

Jeanneret; Art Deco metalwork, including the elevator shaft of the Grunfeld Department Store, lighting fixtures, lettering, locks, and folding screens; Art Deco shops and department stores; Art Deco buildings; Art Deco stained glass, including the window wall in the Bally Shoe Store; Art Deco sculpture; Art Deco dishes, flatware, tea services, cut crystal bottles, mirrors, and case; Art Deco jewelry; Art Deco ornamental sculpture; and more. These are among the many facets of the prismatic, geometrical Art Deco style that captured the 1920s and '30s. This new selection of Art Deco styles includes works in all of the above categories from 175 artists, architects, and designers, including Edgar Brandt, Marcel Breuer, Pierre Chareau, Jean Fouquet, Gabriel Gu\u00e9vr\u00e9kian, Le Corbusier, Pierre Legrain, Andr\u00e9 Lur\u00e7at, Robert Mallet-Stevens, the Martels, Gustave Miklos, Charles Moreux, Raymond Nicholas, Charlotte Perriand, Jean Puiforcat, Rebe-Herbst, G\u00e9rard Sandoz, Henri Sauvage, Raymond Subes, and Gaston Vuitton. The selection is primarily from L'Art International d'Aujourd'hui (International Art of Today), the already rare 20-volume work containing the authentic documents of the movement. Although the influences are many \u2014 Egyptian and Aztec art, Cubism, Fauvism, and Expressionism \u2014 the goal \"to unite arts with industry\" and the strongly geometric outlook are common. The Art Deco movement did not stop in the 1920s and '30s however. It is still very important for present-day design. For the finest illustrations, whether you are searching for inspirations for designs or for a better look at the very important style of the '20s and '30s, this book will provide you with a true picture of the Art Deco style.",
