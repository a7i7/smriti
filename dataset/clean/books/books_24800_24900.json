Upon this fertile, nourishing earth, Jane Smiley has set her rich, breathtakingly dramatic novel of an American family whose wealth cannot stay the hand of tragedy. It is the intense, compelling story of a father and his daughters, of sisters, of wives and husbands, and of the human cost of a lifetime spent trying to subdue the land and the passions it stirs. The most critically acclaimed novel of the literary season, a classic story of contemporary American life, A THOUSAND ACRES is destined to be read for years to come.\"It has been a long time since a novel so surprised me with its power to haunt . . . . Its genius grows from its ruthless acceptance of the divided nature of every character . . . . This gives A THOUSAND ACRES the prismatic quality of the greatest art.\" -- Chicago TribuneWinner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle AwardFrom the Trade Paperback edition.",

His last relationship, with a witty and impetuous man, ended a couple of years ago, but they continue to see each other as friends - linked by a strong sense of family. Pete's fear of intimacy, combined with the long shadow of AIDS, has kept him cautious, frustrated, and alone.When Pete's mother, the lively and strong-willed matriarch of a well-to-do Philadelphia clan, is diagnosed with cancer, her illness becomes the catalyst for Pete and his siblings to face their own demons. Bea and Mary Alice - two sisters as different as beer and champagne - struggle to understand how a woman as sophisticated and unrelenting as their mother would neglect her own health. Stu, Pete's successful stockbroker brother with an insensitive wife and a secret that could put him behind bars, chooses withdrawal. Phil - successful businessman, aloof father, and loving husband - is neither certain of his own future nor confident in his role in this adult family. And Pete, desperate to transcend his isolation but afraid to take the risk, becomes the focus of his mother's mission to close the gaps in the family, while there's still time.",

        "Authors": "By Steinberg, Jacques",
        "Description": "There are few more unnerving rites of passage in America today than the process of applying to college, for at almost no other time in young people's lives do they face a decision that they perceive will have as profound an effect on their futures. Over the last two decades the competition to gain admission to a top-tier school has grown ever more intense as the pedigree these schools confer becomes increasingly significant in the job and graduate school markets. This competitiveness has helped generate a range of businesses, from SAT-preparation courses to counseling services to shelves of college guidebooks and to U.S. News & World Report's highly influential annual college rankings issue.The Gatekeepers opens in the fall semester as Steinberg accompanies the central figure of the book, admissions officer Ralph Figueroa, on his annual sales trip around the country as he presents the case for Wesleyan to groups of high school seniors while assessing the most talented among them. In the course of Ralph's travels we meet a number of prospective Wesleyan students whom we will follow through the course of the academic year, during which they compete for places in the nation's most elite colleges. There is Julianna Bentes, a gifted multiracial student on scholarship at an exclusive Los Angeles prep school who is pursued as ardently as any pitching prodigy would be in the major leagues; Becca Jannol, who broke a cardinal rule as a high school sophomore and then took the risk of writing about what she learned from the experience in her college essays; Migizi Pensoneau, a Native American who has overcome a poor educational record to successfully attend a progressive, experimental school in New Mexico; Jordan Goldman, an ambitious Staten Island writer for whom attending an Ivy League school has been a lifelong dream; and Aggie Ramirez, a Dominican who has already shown herself to be a natural leader but whose grades have suffered in the process.Because Steinberg has had the cooperation of the Wesleyan staff, the students, and their teachers and advisers, we are able to follow the admission process in every detail - from the initial reading of the applicants' essays to the final, often contentious meetings at which their fates will be decided. The Gatekeepers will be required reading for every parent of a high school age child and for every student who is facing the arduous and anxious task of applying to college. Never before has this mysterious process been revealed with such clarity, such insight, and such drama.",

        "Authors": "By Clark, Elaine A.",
        "Description": "Well-established voice actors can often earn as much in one hour as a stage actor might make in six weeks. And while actors in the know have always relied on voice-overs as a steady source of income, the recent influx of well-known actors and personalities lending their voices to television commercials and cartoon characters has imbued the field with a new, more highly esteemed reputation. These big-name talents have stumbled upon the industry's best-kept secret: that voice-overs are fun as well as profitable.Breaking into the voice-over arena takes a flexible voice but it also requires a knowledge of the business, and There's Money Where Your Mouth Is provides it all, from sample commercials to savvy industry advice. Author Elaine Clark discusses script copy, showing how to interpret it and bring it to life. She includes a look at the various markets a voice talent can enter, complete with specific guidelines on how to branch out and break into each area. Information on the ins and outs of the business and self-promotion, plus guidelines for exercising the voice, will be helpful to both newcomers and seasoned voice talents.",

That selection is pared down to the twenty or so very best pieces by a guest editor who is widely recognized as a leading writer in his or her field. This unique system has helped make the Best American series the most respected -- and most popular -- of its kind.   From The New Yorker to the Missouri Review, from Esquire to the American Scholar, the editors of The Best American Essays have scoured hundreds of the country's best periodicals in search of the most artful and powerful writing around.

But I got as much pleasure out of the idea as I could before I had to let go of it.And so begins Melancholy Baby, the fourth novel in the bestselling series featuring Sunny Randall, who now faces the unthinkable: the marriage of her ex-husband, Richie, to someone else. Despite the formality of divorce, Sunny and Richie's relationship continued, in its own headstrong way, until his desire for marriage overtook her need for freedom. Now, Sunny must try to pull herself together and move on - or around - these emotional roadblocks. When college student Sarah Markham comes asking for help in finding her birth parents, Sunny realizes she must take the case, if only to distract herself from her personal life. Sarah has long felt something was not quite right about her family and though her father was loving, her relationship with her mother has been chilly at best. Sunny's initial inquiries have some alarming consequences.The P.I.'s life and work have a curious - and dangerous - way of intersecting: before the investigation has a chance to really take off, two key players are dead, and Sunny is back on a psychiatrist's couch, probing her own past for clues. What she discovers has the potential to shatter Sarah Markham's family and destroy her sense of self, while Sunny's own beliefs are put to the ultimate test.",

        "Title": "All Our Yesterdays: A Century of Family Life in an American Small Town",
        "Authors": "By Robertson, James Oliver and Robertson, Janet C.",
        "Description": "A little over twenty-five years ago, James and Janet Robertson, a young couple with two children, bought an eighteenth-century house in Hampton, a small town in northeastern Connecticut. For more than one hundred and fifty years this beautiful, characteristic New England structure had been home to an unusually accumulative family named Taintor, who saved a vast quantity of papers - personal and business letters; accounts of travel; newspapers and other periodicals; bills and business files; books and pamphlets; visiting cards, invitations, and playbills; college catalogues and notes and class speeches.Drawing on the remarkable riches of the Taintor collection, the Robertsons record the experiences of the family since the 1790s. Two young couples, the brothers Roger and Solomon Taintor and their wives, the sisters Abigail and Judith (nee Bulkeley), were the first of the family to live in the house. Harmoniously occupying it together, they established themselves among the town's leading citizens; as merchants and livestock dealers, they soon began to participate in local politics and eventually moved some of their capital into out-of-town industrial and financial ventures. Their sons, cousins raised in the house like brothers, in time enrolled at Yale, reporting from there in astonishingly frank letters on student riots and girl-chasing but also seriously reflecting on their studies and travels, future careers, and the rituals of courtship. The surprisingly varied lives of the Taintor women, too, are vividly and candidly revealed in their expressive correspondence and other personal documents. As the generations pass, we come to know intimately - in their own words as amplified by the Robertsons' thoughtfully informed narrative - these feisty, frugal Yankees who created their share of the uniquely American economy, fought to preserve the Union, and finally entered the modern world still maintaining the small-town values that continue to this day to shape our national life as a guiding mythology.All Our Yesterdays takes us back into the very midst of the daily life that would become the model of our country's perception of itself, into the reality of the past as it was actually lived - births and deaths, gossip and scandal, triumphs and reversals at work and at home; attitudes toward sex, love, and marriage; the local reverberations of great national political events and wars. \"It was a wonderful serendipity that connected us to such a treasure trove,\" the Robertsons write, and in All Our Yesterdays they brilliantly share their good fortune with the rest of us.",

As the sole survivor of a brutal crime back East, she has been on the run, desperately fighting the nightmares and panic attacks that haunt her. Reece settles in Angel's Fist, Wyoming - temporarily, at least-and takes a job at a local diner. And now she's hiked this mountain all by herself. It was glorious, she thought, as she peered through her binoculars at the Snake River churning below.  Then Reece saw the man and woman on the opposite bank. Arguing. Fighting. And suddenly, the man was on top of the woman, his hands around her throat . . .  Enjoying a moment of solitude a bit farther down the trail is a gruff loner named Brody. But by the time Reece reaches him and brings him to the scene, the pair has vanished. When authorities comb the area where she saw the attack, they find nothing.No signs of struggle. No freshly turned earth. Not even a tire track.  And no one in Angel's Fist seems to believe her. After all, she's a newcomer in town, with a reputation for being jumpy and jittery-maybe even a little fragile. Maybe it's time to run again, to move on . . .  Reece Gilmore knows there's a killer in Angel's Fist, even if Brody, despite his seeming impatience and desire to keep her at arm's length, is the only one willing to believe her. When a series of menacing events makes it clear that someone wants her out of the way, Reece must put her trust in Brody-and herself-to find out if there is a killer in Angel's Fist before it's too late.",

        "Authors": "By Morris, Holly",
        "Description": "After years of working behind a desk, Holly Morris had finally had enough. So she quit her job and set out to prove that adventure is not just a vacation style but a philosophy of living and to find like-minded, risk-taking women around the globe. With modest backing, a small television crew, her spirited producer-mother, Jeannie, and a whole lot of chutzpah, Morris tracked down artists, activists, and politicos\u2013women of action who are changing the rules and sometimes the world around them.In these pages, Morris brings to life the remarkable people and places she\u2019s encountered on the road while filming her PBS series Adventure Divas and other programs. We meet Assata Shakur, a former Black Panther and social activist and now a fugitive living in exile in Cuba; Kiran Bedi, New Delhi\u2019s chief of police, who revolutionized India\u2019s infamously brutal Tijar Jail with her humanitarian ethic; New Zealand pop star Hinewehi Mohi, a Maori who reinvigorates her native culture for a new generation; and Mokarrameh Ghanbari, a septuagenarian painter and rice farmer who lives in the tiny village of Darikandeh on the Caspian plains of Iran, where her creative talents run counter to the government\u2019s strict stance on art. Along the way, Morris herself becomes a certified Adventure Diva, as she hunts for wild boar with Penan tribesmen in the jungles of Borneo, climbs the Matterhorn short-roped to a salty fourth-generation Swiss guide, and memorably becomes the first woman ever to enter the traditional camel race of the Saharan oasis town of Timia.Intelligent, phenomenally funny, and chock-full of rich and telling details of place, Adventure Divas is a pro-woman chronicle for the twenty-first century. In a pilgrimage fueled by curiosity, ideology, and full-on estrogen power, Holly Morris has paved the way for all of us to discover our own diva within and set out on our own adventures.From the Hardcover edition.",

Bikers, con artists, drunk drivers, drug dealers - they're all on Mickey Haller's client list. For him, the law is rarely about guilt or innocence - it's about negotiation and manipulation.

        "Title": "Sanctuary: Joust #3 (Dragon Jousters)",
        "Authors": "By Lackey, Mercedes",
        "Description": "The young man known as Kiron, who had once been a dragon-boy called Vetch, had achieved more than he had ever dreamed possible. He had escaped the Jouster's compound in Tia on the back of Avatre - a scarlet dragon he had raised from the egg - a tame dragon that was bonded to him. As he had crossed the vast desert with the help of the nomads called the Veiled Ones, he had carried with him one of the greatest treasures of his world: the key to taming dragons. And when he reached Alta, the kingdom of his birth, his bravery had linked him with the family of a powerful nobleman, Lord Yi-tiren, who had, in turn, introduced him and his dragon-taming techniques to the compound of the Altan Jousters. He had been able to gather a group of dedicated young people who understood the rigors involved and were up to the task of raising a dragonet from the egg. And he had ended up with more than he had ever dreamed of: eight close friends, and eight beautiful, varied, spirited yet tame dragonets. Enough, when led by Kiron and Avatre, to form an entire fighting wing.But there was also a dark side to Kiron's life. For in gaining entree into Altan noble society, he had come to learn many distressing things about who really controlled Alta, especially with the help of Lord Ya-tiren's daughter Aket-ten, who had the magical Gifts of Animal Speech, Silent Speech, and the Far-Seeing Eye. Aket-ten was a Fledgling of the magical order of the Winged Ones, and this gentle order was being threatened by a more powerful and less ethical magical order - the Magi. The Magi were subtly but systematically draining the Winged Ones of their magic - thus strengthening themselves. But that was only part of the evil picture. For Aket-ten and Kiron soon began to realize that the Magi were plotting to surreptitiously replace the royal Great Ones and rule Alta, and that they had built a terrible weapon, the Eye of Light, which could kill from afar, and would support their reign with terror.Once more, Kiron and Aket-ten had risen to the occasion and had managed, through careful planning, to flee Alta with all the Jousters and dragons, some members of the royal family, and close friends. They had escaped to the Lost City of the desert, a place now called Sanctuary.Kiron knew that they had to hide and increase their numbers before they would have a ghost of a chance against the Magi. But they had garnered a huge advantage - they had freed the dragons of Tia, thereby destroyng the Tiran Jousters' army and effectively ending the war between Tia and Alta. Only Ari, the Jouster who had trained Kiron, had kept his dragon, and had come to join them in Sanctuary. But just surviving in the desert, with more and more sympathetic refugees appearing every day, more people to feed and house, more dragonets to raise, was a daunting prospect. And it was just a matter of time before the Magi found the hiding place of the rebels and attacked.Could Kiron, Aket-ten, Ari, and their allies muster their forces in time to face the Magi? And how would they counter the deadly effects of the Eye of Light?",

He follows his own code of justice, a code that has barred him more than once from the streets he patrols with a vengeance. His last collar may not have cost him his badge, but it's landed him behind a desk in the ballistics lab, where he presides over a sea of mindnumbing paperwork. Unrepentant, he languishes there until Vanessa Bouton, a black captain determined to be the city's first female police commissioner, offers him a ticket out. But liberation has a price: he must work for the ambitious, by-the-book Bouton.The case Bouton has her eye on has set the city aflame. A series of male prostitute murders has baffled the department and sex-crime experts alike, and the high-profile news coverage is turning into a public humiliation for the force. Bouton makes no bones about her interest in the case - she wants to add another notch to her resume - but, as a stranger to the streets, she knows she cannot do it alone.At first, things go as planned. Means gets the lowdown on the street, and Bouton combs through the evidence. But when she brings a psychologist on board to map out the background of the killer, the case takes an unexpected twist for Means. The killer's childhood dangerously mirrors Means's own tormented past.A Good Day to Die brings Roland Means face to face with his demons and, in a stunning conclusion, demands he use them to triumph over a cold-blooded psychopath. From a writer who captures the raw energy of New York City like no one else, this searing novel of discovery and rage is clearly Stephen Solomita's best work to date.",

        "Authors": "By Phillips, Kevin P.",
        "Description": "Everyone knows that Washington is completely out of touch with the rest of the country. Now Kevin Phillips, whose bestselling books have prophesied the major watersheds of American party politics, tells us why. Washington - mired in bureaucracy, captured by the money power of Wall Street, and dominated by 90,000 lobbyists, 60,000 lawyers, and the largest concentration of special interests the world has ever seen - has become the albatross that Thomas Jefferson and our other Founding Fathers feared: a swollen capital city feeding off the country it should be governing. Throughout most of our history, the genius of American politics was that ballot revolutions every generation swept out failed establishments and created new ones. Now that can no longer happen. Feared and even hated by a majority of the citizenry, \"Permanent Washington\" has dug in. Using history as a chilling warning, Kevin Phillips parallels the present atrophy to that of formerly mighty and arrogant capitals like Rome, Madrid, andAmsterdam.,Unchecked, Washington will - like other great powers before it - lead the country to its inevitable decline and fall. To work again, Washington must be purged and revitalized. In his unique blueprint for a political upheaval, Kevin Phillips puts Washington on notice by sounding a cry for immediate action, offering us a wide variety of remedies - some quasi-revolutionary, others more moderate, but all sure to be controversial.",

        "Title": "Hatteras Journal",
        "Authors": "By Deblieu, Jan",
        "Description": "In 1985 Jan DeBlieu moved to Hatteras Island and took up residence in the old home of one of the Outer Banks' most historic families. For more than a year she explored the island's dunes, marshes, waters, and towns to study its complex natural cycles, its fragile ecosystem, its bird, plant, and marine life, and the seasonal routines of its stoical residents. In Hatteras Journal she writes evocatively of a harsh but alluring world, where \"in summer the sea oats explode with tawny seeds, the black shimmers glide over Pamlico Sound, the loggerheads heave themselves ashore on silent nights.\" Along with her perceptive observations about the natural life she encounters, she describes the futility of former government policies such as dune construction, the dangers of peat mining to the sounds and bays, the efforts to protect loggerhead turtles on Bald Head Island, and the evolution of Hurricane Gloria and its effects on the barrier islands. This is a vividly rendered account of the rigors and rewards of dwelling in a habitat where only the most resilient forms of life\u2014natural and human\u2014manage to prevail.Jan DeBlieu is the author of four books and dozens of articles and essays about people and nature. Her first book, Hatteras Journal (Fulcrum 1987), is considered a regional classic on the Outer Banks. It was reprinted in paper by John Blair, Publisher in 1998. Meant to Be Wild (Fulcrum 1991) was chosen as one of the best science books of the year by Library Journal. Wind (Houghton Mifflin, 1998; Shoemaker & Hoard 2006) won the John Burroughs Medal for Distinguished Natural History Writing, the highest national award given for a volume of nature writing. Year of the Comets: A Journey from Sadness to the Stars was published by Shoemaker & Hoard in Spring 2005. All Jan\u2019s books remain in print. Year of the Comets was released in paper in December 2006. Most of Jan\u2019s work explores the subtle ways we are shaped by the landscapes where we live and work. She has contributed essays to many national publications, including The New York Times, Audubon, and Orion.  In the spring of 2003 Jan was named the Cape Hatteras Coastkeeper for the North Carolina Coastal Federation, a grassroots environmental group that works to protect coastal waters from pollution. A longtime environmental activist, in the late 1980s she helped form a group that successfully kept oil companies from drilling off the Outer Banks. She lives on Roanoke Island with her husband and son.\u201cNot since Ben MacNeil wrote The Hatterasman in the 1950s has that bare bone of sand between Bodie and Ocracoke islands been written about so affectionately, intelligently, and well.\u201d \u2014Norfolk Virginian-Pilot",

        "Description": "Who is Osama bin Laden\u2014the only terrorist leader ever to have declared a holy war against America? What drives him and those he leads to hate a West that helped enrich and arm them? Bin Laden's name has been linked to a number of incidents that have cost Americans their lives, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 and the destruction of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Now, he is linked to the recent catastrophic assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.Here is a comprehensive account of the rise of bin Laden. In meticulous detail, world-renowned terrorism expert Yossef Bodansky uncovers the events in bin Laden's life that turned the once-promising engineering student into a cold-blooded leader of radical Islam. In the process, Bodansky reveals a chilling story that is as current as today's headlines but as ancient as the Crusades\u2014a story that transcends bin Laden and any other single man. This book is a sobering wake-up call.\"This fascinating account of Osama bin Laden's war against America illustrates the murky world of Islamic extremism and state sponsored terrorism.\"\u2014Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, Leavey Professor, Department of Government, Georgetown University\"Americans need to know about Osama bin Laden, and the best place to find out is in this trenchant study of the man.
