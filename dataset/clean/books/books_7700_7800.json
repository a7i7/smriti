        "Title": "Doctor, What Should I Eat? : Nutrition Prescriptions for Over 70 Ailments in Which Diet...",
        "Authors": "By Rosenfeld, Isadore",
        "Description": "In Doctor, What Should I Eat?, Isadore Rosenfeld, M.D., one of America's most trusted doctors, gives you specific food recommendations for the conditions in which the role of diet has been clearly and scientifically established. Dr. Rosenfeld discusses how each disorder develops, what you should or should not eat to help your recovery or prevent a recurrence, and which medications will work best with your food prescription. Working with an experienced registered dietitian, he offers dozens of menus and tables to help put his nutrition prescriptions into action.Dr. Rosenfeld dispels many myths and misconceptions about food and illness and helps readers learn how to spot nutritional quacks. He demystifies the complexities typical of much nutritional advice (who wants to plan dinner with a calculator?) and offers straightforward, easy-to-follow advice. He combines his review of thousands of scientific studies with decades of experience from his own clinical practice, giving readers a full spectrum of nutritional solutions, all of which have been vetted by experts in the field.Too many traditional doctors don't pay enough attention to the importance of your diet in treating illness; too many holistic practitioners decry the use of medications. Proper medical treatment should never be a matter of either/or; it should include both sound nutritional advice and recommendations for the most effective medications - the vital combination you'll find in Doctor, What Should I Eat?",

Highlighting cultural criticism with personal experience, she cites ancient myths, Hollywood iconography, and the daily assault of advertising to reveal why the allure of being a blonde has crossed the boundaries of ethnicity, economics, and age. In essence, she shows us the difference between simply having blonde hair and being a blonde.",

        "Title": "The Opening of the American Mind: Canons, Culture, and History",
        "Authors": "By Levine, Lawrence W.",
        "Description": "In recent years there has been a spate of right-wing books attacking the contemporary university. The idea that the university curriculum has been hijacked by radical professors is an article of faith among conservatives and has fueled more than one best-seller. Until now, there has been no forceful, accessible book responding in a comprehensive way for a wide audience.In The Opening of the American Mind, MacArthur award-winning historian Lawrence W. Levine - whose work Henry Louis Gates, Jr. has called \"required reading for everyone interested in American culture and its history\" - takes back the debate with a powerful argument about universities, history, and American identity.Levine shows, first of all, that conservative critics of the university are both systematically wrong and ignorant of history. The canon that they claim is immutable has always been a living thing - shifting with the politics and society of the times. As recently as the late nineteenth century, the very literature the conservatives are nostalgic for was viewed as peripheral; even the president of Yale warned against the perils of studying English or American literature. The western civilization curriculum sixties liberals are accused of dismantling was out of favor before they ever became professorsand was itself the result of a government program after World War I to ensure that American values were taught in the university, not the result of politically neutral inquiry and consensus.With rigorous analysis and wonderfully entertaining storytelling, Levine shows that the new multicultural shift in American culture and education is not the result of a plot by a cabal of politically correct radical professors, but a reflection of a dynamic of social change that is uniquely American - and that is to be celebrated. Levine argues that critics' attacks mask deeper fears of a multicultural society - fears that have ties to old anxieties about immigration and a loss of American identity. Levine defends a positive picture of social change and a new vision of American identity that is inclusive, democratic, and forward-looking.",

We can see it in astounding new developments in technology, in the shift in demand from manual to cerebral skills, and in the virtual disappearance of lifelong, full-time jobs. Handy maintains that discontinuous change requires discontinuous, upside-down thinking, and discusses the need for new kinds of organizations, new approaches to work, new types of schools, and new ideas about the nature of our society.",

Captivated, she spent two years tracking the final stages of the mujaheddin victory over the Soviets, as Afghan friends smuggled her in and out of their country in a variety of guises.Returning to Afghanistan after the attacks on the World Trade Center to report for Britain's Sunday Telegraph, Lamb discovered the people no one else had written about: the abandoned victims of almost a quarter century of war. Among them, the brave women writers of Herat who risked their lives to carry on a literary tradition under the guise of sewing circles; the princess whose palace was surrounded by tanks on the eve of her wedding; the artist who painted out all the people in his works to prevent them from being destroyed by the Taliban; and Khalil Ahmed Hassani, a former Taliban torturer who admitted to breaking the spines of men and then making them stand on their heads.Christina Lamb's evocative reporting brings to life these stories. Her unique perspective on Afghanistan and deep passion for the people she writes about make this the definitive account of the tragic plight of a proud nation.",

        "Title": "The Cheating of America: How Tax Avoidance and Evasion by the Super Rich Are Costing the Country Billions--and What You Can Do About It",
        "Authors": "By Lewis, Charles, Allison, Bill, and Center for Public Integrity (COR)",
        "Description": "Each year millions of income-earning adults and corporations do not pay their fair share of federal income taxes -- whether legally (tax avoidance), illegally (tax evasion), or through shady means (tax \"avoision\"), and their numbers are rising dramatically. In this explosive book, Charles Lewis, founder and executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, and Bill Allison, a former researcher at the Philadelphia Inquirer finger these culprits.Super-rich individuals and corporations alike are increasingly using offshore channels to hide money from the IRS, which seems to have given up on trying to catch them. Meanwhile, the rest of the population suffers. The IRS recently reported that 2,680 filers with incomes of $200,000 or more claimed they owed no taxes, up from 612 in the mid-eighties, and 85 in 1977. While audits of these wealthy taxpayers have plummeted, audits of those earning less than $25,000 per year have risen. Not only that, but in 1997 only 2.3 percent of returns filed by the richest Americans were reviewed.With The Cheating of America, Lewis and Allison aim to unmask those who are stiffing Uncle Sam, as well as the system that permits their activities. They reveal how blue-chip U.S. corporations take advantage of dubious shelters or move their taxable profits offshore. Frequently these same companies have also availed themselves of cheaper labor overseas, laying off thousands of American workers. Some estimates show that more than a trillion dollars are salted away in offshore bank accounts, beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.Lewis and Allison provide a richly detailed and colorful overview of the key players -- federal legislators, the IRS, New York banks, foreign \"tax havens\" -- and the cottage industry that teaches aspiring dodgers how to cheat successfully. At the heart of the book are case studies of some of the most brazen individuals and corporations, including the \"Benedict Arnold Billionaires\" who have expatriated from the United States in order to reduce or eliminate their tax burden.With explosive investigative revelations and the authority of the Center for Public Integrity behind it, The Cheating of America will further educate all those who \"pay their fair share\" while the financial elite dodge their responsibility to society. Sure to enlighten and outrage, The Cheating of America is a must-read for every citizen.",

        "Description": "Sex, violence, evil, and betrayal -- the shocking murder case splashed across the Florida headlines has all the right elements for true-crime writer Marie Lightfoot's next bestseller. And tell the tale she does, in a book that reveals the secrets of a love affair gone fatally wrong. But there are disturbing twists, which leave Marie sensing in her gut that something does not jibe.  Twist number one: the accused is a man of the cloth, who has allegedly killed his wife in collusion with his lover. Twist number two: a pair of young girls findthe body in an abandonedmansion, adding the death of innocence to the magnitude of the crime. Twist number three: a shattering conviction turns the case on its ear. And the ultimate blow: for the first time in her career, Marie fails to win the the killer's confidence during a jailhouse interview. Suddenly, she knows with certainty there ia more to the story than even she realized -- and her conscience won't let her rest.  Then an unexpected visitor -- a shock in itself for the reclusive writer -- confesses something that not even the police know. The revelation may he the missingpiece in a terrifying puzzle -- evidence that teaches Marie a bone-chilling lesson as threatening danger slowly encircles her: to err is human, but underestimating the criminal mind can be deadly.  Nancy Pickard premiered gutsy Marie Lightfoot in the national bestseller The Whole Truth, and kicked off a thrilling new series with \"an intriguing story, fascinatingly told\" (The Philadelphia Inquirer). Now, Pickard once again \"pushes the presumed limits of [crime fiction]\" (Los Angeles Times) as she sends this complex heroine into a jagged maze with one destination: the darkest realm of human nature.",

But the lovers\u2019 plans are foiled when their first cozy interlude of the weekend is disrupted by the appearance of a stunning woman from Tobias\u2019s past. Aspasia Gray\u2019s beauty is as haunting as her connection to Tobias. Her long-deceased fianc\u00e9 was a friend of his--in addition to being an eccentric assassin. The mysterious nature of the bond between Tobias and Aspasia makes Lavinia more than a little uncomfortable. Especially as her first encounter with Aspasia occurs when she finds her in Tobias\u2019s bedchamber...It seems Aspasia is seeking protection--and solace--after receiving an ominous message that eerily recalls the past. Suddenly the obstacles standing betweenTobias and Lavinia appear greater than just a little London gossip--and far more deadly.When events at the castle suggest someone is imitating the dead killer\u2019s methods, the team of Lake and March fervently pursue the investigation--and each other--as their leads take them from Society\u2019s most elegant haunts--and most discreet hideaways--to London\u2019s shadiest backstreets. As their relationship heats up, so does the intrigue. Soon Lavinia will have to employ all her talents to flummox the scoundrel who so rudely interrupted her rendezvous. And then she and Tobias can get back to more pleasurable affairs.",

Joyce Maynard's memoir broke a silence concerning her relationship--at age eighteen--with the famously reclusive author J.D. Salinger, then age fifty-three, who had read a story she wrote for The New York Times in her freshman year of college and sent her a letter that changed her life.With what some have viewed as shocking honesty, Maynard explores her coming of age in an alcoholic family, her mother's dream to mold her into a writer, her self-imposed exile from the world of her peers when she left Yale to live with Salinger, and her struggle to reclaim her self of sense in the crushing aftermath of his dismissal of her not long after her nineteenth birthday. A quarter of a century later--having become a writer, survived the end of her marriage and the deaths of her parents, and with an eighteen-year-old daughter of her own--Maynard pays a visit to the man who broke her heart. The story she tells--of the girl she was and the woman she became--is at once devastating, inspiring, and triumphant.",

In a book that brings a magisterial command of history to the most urgent of contemporary questions, two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., explores the war in Iraq, the presidency, and the future of democracy. Describing unilateralism as \"the oldest doctrine in American history,\" Schlesinger nevertheless warns of the dangers posed by the fatal turn in U.S. policy from deterrence and containment to preventive war. He writes powerfully about George W. Bush's expansion of presidential power and the revived Imperial Presidency (a phrase Schlesinger invented). He reminds us of our country's distinguished legacy of patriotism through dissent in wartime, calling on us to honor that tradition even in the face of our need for security. And he reminds us of the inscrutability of history. War and the American Presidency shines an essential light on the meaning of our history and a guide for using our understanding responsibly in meeting today's challenges.",

When Griet becomes a maid in the household of the painter Johannes Vermeer, she thinks she knows her role: housework, laundry, and the care of his six children.

What no one expects is that Griet's quiet manner, quick perceptions, and fascination with her master's paintings will draw her inexorably into his world. Their growing intimacy sparks whispers; and when Vermeer paints her wearing his wife's pearl earrings, the gossip escalates into a full-blown scandal that irrevocably changes Griet's life.   Written with the precision and focus of an Old Master painting, Girl With a Pearl Earring is a vivid portrait of colorful seventeenth-century Delft, as well as the hauntingly poignant story of one young girl's rite of passage.",

Grant to King George II and from Ronnie to Arnie - Why I Hate the Republicans leaves little doubt that political insight is a dish best served funny. It's a Republican Roast, a little bloody, but deliciously entertaining!In taking to task the fundamental tenets (or is that tenants?) of the Grand Old Party, Randy Howe leaves nothing unquestioned, for, as our beloved president puts it, \"I think if you know what you believe, it makes it a lot easier to answer questions. I can't answer your question.\" Through the mind-boggling doublespeak of Republican stalwarts past and present, the GOP, from its liberal abolitionist roots to its current laissez-faire war-hawk (or is that chicken-hawk?) agenda, is scrupulously dissected. Why I Hate the Republicans cuts deep - combining fact and just a touch of fiction in a \"tribute\" to the spin doctoring that is GOP politics.",

Cohen chronicles and celebrates a life brimming over with accomplishment, adversity and personal endeavour and his story has struck a chord with readers nation\u2013wide. He has been interviewed by Barbara Walters for a nearly hour\u2013long segment that ran on 20/20, he also appeared on wife Viera's program, The View and is scheduled for Charlie Rose, Larry King Live, Good Morning America, and the Paula Zahn Show, among others.

Autobiographical at its roots, reportorial and expansive, Blindsided builds on Cohen's story as a task aimed at emotional well\u2013being, if not survival, pursued in sober tones that explore coping to its most redemptive and complex levels. Despite his extreme circumstances, Cohen's is a common struggle, recognisable as an integral part of humanity, and one which he explores with varying amounts of diligence, respect, personal revelation and humour.",

        "Authors": "By Berg, A. Scott",
        "Description": "For seven decades Katharine Hepburn played a leading role in the popular culture of the twentieth century - reigning as an admired actress, a beloved movie star, and a treasured icon of the modern American woman. She also remained one of the most private of all the public figures of her time.In 1983 - at the age of seventy-five, her career cresting - the four-time Academy Award winner opened the door to biographer A. Scott Berg - then thirty-three - and began a special friendship, one that endured to the end of her illustrious life.From the start, Scott Berg felt that Katharine Hepburn intended his role to be not just that of a friend but also of a chronicler, a confidant who might record for posterity her thoughts and feelings. Over the next twenty years, Kate used their many hours together to reveal all that came to mind, often reflecting on the people and episodes of her past, occasionally on the meaning of life.Here are the stories from those countless intimate conversations, and much more. In addition to recording heretofore untold biographical details of her entire phenomenal career and her famous relationships with such men as Spencer Tracy and Howard Hughes, Kate Remembered also tells the amusing, often emotional story of one of the most touching friendships in her final years. Scott Berg provides his own memories of Katharine Hepburn offstage - quiet dinners in her town house in New York City, winter swims (she swam, he watched) in the Long Island Sound at Fenwick, her home in Connecticut, weekend visits with family members and dear friends...even some unusual appearances by the likes of Michael Jackson and Warren Beatty. Finally, Kate Remembered discusses the legendary actress's moving farewell, during which her mighty personality surrendered at last to her failing body - all the while remaining true to her courageous character.Kate Remembered is a book about love and friendship, family and career, Hollywood and Broadway - all punctuated by unforgettable lessons from an extraordinary life.",

        "Description": "The magic of The Sound of Music lives on in the minds and hearts of everyone it has touched. Now, Charmian Carr, who in 1965 captivated moviegoers as Liesl \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" von Trapp, tells what it was like to be a part of the film that has become a cultural phenomenon. It's all here: from how she got the role (and why she almost didn't) to romances on the set and wild nights in Salzburg; from the near-disaster during the gazebo dance to her relationships--then and now--with her six celluloid siblings. Charmian offers stories from fans and friends and a treasury of photographs. And she reveals why she left acting, what she learned when she met the real von Trapp children; and how The Sound of Music has helped her get through stormy times in her own life.  Forever Liesl celebrates the spirit of the movie and what it stands for: family love, romance, inspiration, nostalgia, and the joy and power of music.",
