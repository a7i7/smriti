        "Description": "Never are we more concerned with getting it right than when writing to one who has suffered a loss. In My Deepest Sympathies--, letter-writing guru Florence Isaacs guides us through the ins and outs of offering comfort and support with short yet meaningful notes that will long be remembered by their recipients. She offers guidelines for diverse situations, with sample letters to draw on, so that it's easy to strike the appropriate tone every time.         Isaacs explains that the individual circumstances help determine what's appropriate to say in a sympathy note, and she provides specific techniques for a wide range of relationships, from the death of a coworker's spouse to the loss of a friend's elderly parent from Alzheimer's. She also addresses complex situations like the death of an ex-wife, an estranged sibling, or a longtime companion. She even includes thoughtful words for the death of a pet.Whether it's for a blank note or a few extra lines on a card, Isaacs's advice runs the gamut from personal to professional. And she explains how to provide real help to the bereaved by making phone calls, running errands, or simply lending an ear. Information on funerals, memorial services, and proper etiquette when someone of a different culture has died will help readers avoid missteps in potentially awkward situations. Isaacs closes with techniques for effective eulogies, plus a special appendix of actual eulogies that illustrate ways in which readers can memorialize a loved one for family and friends.         Filled with practical information, My Deepest Sympathies-- makes it simple to say and do the right thing at difficult times.",

        "Description": "Organizational Diagnosis suggest ways of looking at an organization to determine \u201dgaps\u201d between \u201dwhat is\u201d and \u201dwhat ought to be.\u201dIn workbook format, the author presents a vocabulary and concepts which quickly help the reader understand many things about an organization and decide what changes need to be made. To help in the diagnosis, a \u201dsix-box model\u201d using the categories if structure, purposes, relationships, rewards, helpful mechanisms, and leadership is provided in Part I. On left-hand pages are presented the vocabulary and concepts of this diagnostic process, the various factors affecting an organization&#39;s performance, and the key elements leading to improvement. The right-hand pages in Part I furnish brief pencil-and-paper exercises for trying out these theories and evaluating any organization the reader is familiar with. Part II consists of annotated readings from leading theory sources, offering opportunities for a more comprehensive study of the diagnostic concepts introduced in Part I of the book. Thus readers can proceed from brief theory, to personal experience, to in-depth study&#151;as they wish. The six-box framework provides a way of organizing experience that makes sense to managers.Weisbord&#39;s concepts have been applied successfully to work teams, industrial firms, government agencies, universities, medical centers, and small businesses. They can be used as a \u201dcognitive\u201d framework for team development, management training, supervisory training courses, organizational behavior education, or diagnostic self-study.The two parts, theory and practice in the first section plus resource readings in the second, make this an ideal book around which to design introductory courses in organizational behavior, as part of undergraduate or graduate management training. The book may also be used in continuing education courses, whether oriented toward industry, the public sector, or health care.",

Her life in rural Tennessee was filled with family, friends, school, cheerleading, and the daily tasks of living on a farm. And then came a little show called Hannah Montana.  Almost overnight, Miley would rocket to superstardom, becoming a television and singing phenomenon. Quiet days were replaced with sold-out concerts, television appearances, and magazine shoots. But through it all, Miley has remained close to her family and friends and has stayed connected to the Southern roots that made her so strong.  In Miles to Go, Miley offers an honest, humorous, and often touching story of one girl's coming-of-age--from private moments with her pappy to off-roading with her dad, Billy Ray, to her run-ins with mean girls. Miley talks about suffering through drama and heartbreak and coming out the other end unscathed (relatively). And now for the first time, she will discuss it all?the milestones still left to reach (driver\u2019s license! voting!), dreams to live out (travel to Asia! find true love!), and the lessons to be learned (remembernig to enjoy every moment!).

Without it, modern society grinds to a halt. It is electricity. The killer harnesses and steers huge arc flashes with voltage so high and heat so searing that steel melts and his victims are set afire. When the first explosion occurs in broad daylight, reducing a city bus to a pile of molten metal, officials fear terrorism. Rhyme, a world-class forensic criminologist known for his successful apprehension of the most devious criminals, is immediately tapped for the investigation. Long a quadriplegic, he assembles NYPD detective Amelia Sachs and officer Ron Pulaski as his eyes, ears and legs on crime sites, and FBI agent Fred Dellray as his undercover man on the street. As the attacks continue across the city at a sickening pace, and terrifying demand letters begin appearing, the team works desperately against time and with maddeningly little forensic evidence to try to find the killer. Or is it killers\u2026? Meanwhile, Rhyme is consulting on another high-profile investigation in Mexico with a most coveted quarry in his crosshairs: the hired killer known as the Watchmaker, one of the few criminals to have eluded Rhyme\u2019s net.

Soon Rhyme is fighting on yet another front\u2014and his determination to work despite his physical limitations threatens to drive away his closest allies when he needs them most\u2026",

It was at the historical ancestral home that Liza's seemingly idyllic fairytale childhood began to resemble a nightmare.     Increasingly overwhelmed by his enormous responsibilities, Liza's father Hugh, the twenty-fifth Thane of Cawdor, tipped into madness fueled by drink, drugs, and extramarital affairs. Over the years, the castle was transformed into an arena of reckless extravagance and terrifying domestic violence, as Liza and her siblings watched their father destroy himself, his family, and their centuries-old legacy.      Painstakingly honest, thoroughly entertaining, and sharply written, Campbell's contemporary fairytale tells of growing up as a maiden in a castle where ancient curses and grisly events from centuries ago live on between its stone walls. \"[A] courageous memoir . . . a page turner set among moats, drawbridges, and portcullises both real and metaphorical.\" \u2014Vogue\"Superbly written.\" \u2014Harper's Bazaar\"Poignant . . . lovely.\" \u2014Entertainment Weekly\"Edged with relentless wit . . .

Based on the widespread success of the first four editions, this popular resource has been updated and revised to reflect changes in the development, testing, integration, and application of essential criminological theories.In clear, engaging language, authors Ronald L. Akers and Christine S. Sellers explore each principal criminological theory through the following in-depth analysis:* Introduction: Presents a succinct exposition of the theory's central concepts, assertions, and hypotheses--including recent modifications and revisions* Evaluation: Provides a detailed critique of the theory, with a focus on empirical validity* Application: Extends the evaluation to determine each theory's relevance, as well as its potential for controlling and preventing crime and delinquencyTo draw students into the material, the fifth edition incorporates a helpful new resource that provides an overview of every major theory of criminal and deviant behavior--Table 12.1. An invaluable pedagogical tool, this table directs students to the corresponding chapter for each theory; it also includes brief entries on each theory's major proponents, concepts, propositions, empirical validity, and policy implications. Encouraging students to carefully review--and thoughtfully compare--these theories, the table creates a dynamic connection between readers and the text.Ideal for courses on theories of crime, delinquency, and deviance, Criminological Theories, Fifth Edition, also serves as an excellent supplement for courses in criminology, juvenile delinquency, deviance, and criminal behavior.",

        "Authors": "By Franzini, Louis R. and Grossberg, John M., Ph.D.",
        "Description": "An engrossing look into the heart of twelve of the strangest psychological disorders known to scienceIn a book reminiscent of Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, psychologists Louis Franzini and John Grossberg take us behind the tabloid headlines and media exposes to tell the real-life stories of emotionally damaged men and women driven to horrific extremes in their efforts to gratify their basic human needs for love and attention.Writing with compassion and offering many profound insights into the human condition, the authors provide rare, often wrenching, glimpses into the tortured worlds of necrophiliacs, who make love only to corpses, and \"werewolves\" who commit unthinkable acts of mutilation and cannibalism; of men paralyzed by the terrifying belief that their penises are disappearing into their bodies, and compulsive hair pullers, who pluck every last hair from their flesh; of paranoids who believe they are being stalked by their evil twins, and those convinced that everyone close to them is an imposter; and many others.All of the stories contained in Eccentric and Bizarre Behaviors are based on actual case studies. Throughout, Drs. Franzini and Grossberg discuss, in terms that general readers can understand, both the known and conjectural causes for the strange disorders they describe. And, in many cases, they recount the stirring details of how patients were ultimately rescued from the eccentric and bizarre patterns of behavior in which they had become imprisoned.",
