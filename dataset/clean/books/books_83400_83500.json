        "Title": "MacArthur's War : Korea and the Undoing of an American Hero",
        "Authors": "By Weintraub, Stanley",
        "Description": "Douglas MacArthur towers over twentieth-century American history. His fame is based chiefly on his World War II service in the Philippines. Yet Korea, America's forgotten war, was far more \"MacArthur's War\" -- and it remains one of our most brutal and frightening. In just three years thirty-five thousand Americans lost their lives -- more than three times the rate of losses in Vietnam. Korea, like Vietnam, was a breeding ground for the crimes of war. To this day, six thousand Americans remain MIA. It was Korea where American troops faced a Communist foe for the first time, as both China and the Soviet Union contributed troops to the North Korean cause. The war that nearly triggered the use of nuclear weapons reveals MacArthur at his most flamboyant, flawed, yet still, at times, brilliant.  Acclaimed historian Stanley Weintraub offers a thrilling blow-by-blow account of the key actions of the Korean War during the months of MacArthur's command. Our lack of preparedness for the invasion, our disastrous retreat to a corner of Korea, the daring landing at Inchon, the miscalculations in pursuing the enemy north, the headlong retreats from the Yalu River and Chosin Reservoir, and the clawing back to the 38th parallel, all can be blamed or credited to MacArthur. He was imperious, vain, blind to criticism, and so insubordinate that Truman was forced to fire him. Yet years later, the war would end where MacArthur had left it, at the border that still stands as one of history's last frontiers between communism and freedom.  MacArthur's War draws on extensive archival research, memoirs, and the latest findings from archives in the formerly communist world, to weave a rich tale in the voices of its participants. From MacArthur and his upper cadre, to feisty combat correspondent Maggie Higgins and her fellow journalists, to the grunts who bore the brunt of MacArthur's decisions, for good and ill, this is a harrowing account of modern warfare at its bloodiest. MacArthur's War is the gripping story of the Korean War and its soldiers -- and of the one soldier who dominated the rest.",

        "Description": "Imriel de la Courcel's blood parents are history's most reviled traitors, while his adoptive parents, Ph\u00e8dre and Joscelin, are Terre d'Ange's greatest champions.  Stolen, tortured, and enslaved as a young boy, Imriel is now a Prince of the Blood, third in line for the throne in a land that revels in beauty, art, and desire. After a year abroad to study at university, Imriel returns from his adventures a little older and somewhat wiser.  But perhaps not wise enough.  What was once a mere spark of interest between himself and his cousin Sidonie now ignites into a white-hot blaze.  But from commoner to peer, the whole realm would recoil from any alliance between Sidonie, heir to the throne, and Imriel, who bears the stigma of his mother's misdeeds and betrayals.  Praying that their passion will peak and fade, Imriel and Sidonie embark on an intense, secret affair.  Blessed Elua founded Terre d'Ange and bestowed one simple precept to guide his people, love as thou wilt.  When duty calls, Imriel honors his role as a member of the royal family by leaving to marry a lovely, if merely sweet, Alban princess.  By choosing duty over love, Imriel and Sidonie may have unwittingly trespassed against Elua's law.  But when dark powers in Alba, who fear an invasion by Terre d'Ange, seek to use the lovers' passion to bind Imriel, the gods themselves take notice.  Before the end, Kushiel's justice will be felt in heaven and on earth.",

        "Description": "An authoritative edition of what D.H. Lawrence called \"the most improper novel in the world\"With her soft brown hair, lithe figure and big, wondering eyes, Constance Chatterley is possessed of a certain vitality. Yet she is deeply unhappy; married to an invalid, she is almost as inwardly paralysed as her husband Clifford is paralysed below the waist. It is not until she finds refuge in the arms of Mellors the game-keeper, a solitary man of a class apart, that she feels regenerated. Together they move from an outer world of chaos towards an inner world of fulfillment. Included here, in his essay A Propos of Lady Chatterley's Lover, are Lawrence's own, final thoughts on male-female relationships in the modern world. This Penguin edition reproduces the newly established Cambridge text, the first edition ever to restore to Lawrence's most famous work the words he wrote and the first to correct authoritatively the 1928 Florence edition which Lawrence personally supervised.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700\u00a0titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

The Communist party, the armed forces, and key elites and institutions are analyzed in light of deepening economic and political difficulties. Changes in leadership and Castro\u2019s dominant role are also discussed.The author argues that an incipient process of economic reform is at odds with Marxist ideology and that the failure to liberalize in order to retain political control suggests that the regime is seriously concerned about the emergence of political dissidence and other forms of opposition. He also assesses the prospects for peaceful or for violent political change and looks at how the legacy of socialism and the Revolution will shape Cuba\u2019s future.",

As a young woman in Cairo in the 1940s and '50s, Ahmed witnessed some of the major transformations of this century?the end of British colonialism, the creation of Israel, the rise of Arab nationalism, and the breakdown of Egypt's once multireligious society. Amid the turmoil, she searched to define herself?and to see how the world defined her?as a woman, a Muslim, an Egyptian, and an Arab. In this memoir, she poignantly reflects upon issues of language, race, and nationality, while unveiling the hidden world of women's Islam. Ahmed's story wil be an inspiration to anyone who has ever struggled to define their own cultural identity.",

She has created a new category - seafood pizzas - and devotes a chapter to this savory treat with such great combinations as Clam and Potato Pizza and Tuna and Pesto Pizza. New and imaginative ideas include Mussel-Filled Foccacia in the \"Starters\" chapter; Monkfish Winter Stew in \"Chowders, Bisques, Soups, and Stews\"; Angel-Hair Pasta with Smoked Salmon Carbonara in the \"Pasta\" chapter; and Sauteed Bluefish with an Apple Crust and Oyster Bread Pudding, to name just a few recipes from the \"Main Course\" sections.There is a chapter on the best choices of vegetables to pair with seafood, and another with a collection of light desserts.

        "Description": "\"Irwin Kula shows us how to to live our humanness -- the pleasures and the challenges, the messiness and the triumphs -- with a profound acceptance of our desires and foibles and a joy that can only come from understanding.\" --Deepak Chopra \"Yearning. After twenty-three years as a rabbi, I can think of no more defining human experience.\" Life can be messy and imperfect. We're all looking for answers. And yet, as renowned rabbi Irwin Kula points out, the yearning for answers is no different now than it was in the times that gave rise to Moses, Buddha, and Jesus. Far from being a burden, however, these yearnings can themselves become a path to blessing, prompting questions and insights, resulting in new ways of being and believing. In this, his first book, Rabbi Kula takes us on an excursion into the depths of our desires, applying ancient Jewish tradition to seven of our most wonderful yearnings. Merging ancient wisdom with contemporary insights, Rabbi Kula shows how traditional practices can inform and enrich our own search for meaning. More importantly, he invites us to embrace the messiness and complexities of the human experience in order to fully embrace the endless and glorious project of life.",

        "Authors": "By Mitchell, Charles W. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Winner of the Founders Award from the American Civil War MuseumThe most contentious event in our nation\u2019s history, the Civil War deeply divided families, friends, and communities. Both sides fought to define the conflict on their own terms\u2014Lincoln and his supporters struggled to preserve the Union and end slavery, while the Confederacy waged a battle for the primacy of local liberty or \"states' rights.\" But the war had its own peculiar effects on the four border slave states that remained loyal to the Union. Internal disputes and shifting allegiances injected uncertainty, apprehension, and violence into the everyday lives of their citizens.No state better exemplified the vital role of a border state than Maryland\u2014where the passage of time has not dampened debates over issues such as the alleged right of secession and executive power versus civil liberties in wartime. In Maryland Voices of the Civil War, Charles W. Mitchell draws upon hundreds of letters, diaries, and period newspapers\u2014many previously unpublished\u2014to portray the passions of a wide variety of people\u2014merchants, slaves, soldiers, politicians, freedmen, women, clergy, slave owners, civic leaders, and children\u2014caught in the emotional vise of war. Mitchell tells the compelling story of how Maryland African Americans escaped from slavery and fought for the Union and their freedom alongside white soldiers and he reinforces the provocative notion that Maryland\u2019s Southern sympathies\u2014while genuine\u2014never seriously threatened to bring about a Confederate Maryland. Maryland Voices of the Civil War illuminates the human complexities of the Civil War era and the political realignment that enabled Marylanders to abolish slavery in their state before the end of the war.",

She'd even lived in a tree house and shepherded goats in Minorca. But none of these unusual experiences prepared her for the most dramatic turn her life would take: the diagnosis of an aggressive form of breast cancer. In this brilliantly funny and irreverent memoir, Norton approaches the disease with a refreshing combination of humor and tenacity, railing against victimhood and self-pity and refusing to become a stereotype. Told with a razor-sharp wit akin to David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs, Lopsided is most definitely not a typical cancer memoir; it's the bitingly funny debut of a natural-born social observer.",

Next, the book offers four key principles for understanding and facilitating literacy, along with easy-to-follow techniques for starting - or refining - teacher research and inquiry in the classroom.  The bulk of the text is devoted to practical, curriculum-enhancing literacy engagements. For each type of engagement, Owocki explains how it fosters language and literacy development; provides ideas for instruction, assessment, evaluation, and teacher research; offers practical methods and materials for getting the engagement started; suggests related activities involving art, drama, movement, writing, drawing, talk, or play; and includes actual teaching and learning examples from classrooms.",

With an unmistakable voice that resonates with millions, lyrics that speak volumes in the span of three minutes, and a career that lasted nearly five decades, Johnny Cash was peerless in his style and had a vast influence on country, folk, and rock music.The legendary \"Man in Black\" (who originally wanted to be a gospel singer) wrote his first hit record for Sam Phillips at Sun Records in the 1950s...and in 2003 turned a Nine Inch Nails song into one of the most deeply moving music videos ever created. A man of uncommon grace and innate goodness, Johnny Cash plied his gifts, fought his demons, and lived a life that was his alone -- enjoying one of the great love stories of the century with his wife, June, while somehow managing to leave a little of himself with people all over the world.In Cash: An American Man, fans of his music are now given a unique and personal glimpse into his life through hundreds of photographs, private letters, handwritten lyrics, his final interview given just three weeks before his death, and other astonishing memorabilia -- a one-of-a-kind collection fully authorized by the Johnny Cash Estate and created in cooperation with his friend, confidant, and lifelong fan, Bill Miller. Lavishly illustrated and designed by the award-winning team at Rare Air Media, Cash: An American Man is sure to be one of the most talked-about books of the year, and the ultimate tribute to one of the music's most enduring figures.",

        "Authors": "By Dickens, Charles",
        "Description": "\"My satire is against those who see figures and averages, and nothing else,\" proclaimed Charles Dickens in explaining the theme of this classic novel. Published in 1854, the story concerns one Thomas Gradgrind, a \"fanatic of the demonstrable fact,\" who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby, a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime. Witnessing the degradation and downfall of his children, Gradgrind realizes that his own misguided principles have ruined their lives.Considered Dickens' harshest indictment of mid-19th-century industrial practices and their dehumanizing effects, this novel offers a fascinating tapestry of Victorian life, filled with the richness of detail, brilliant characterization, and passionate social concern that typify the novelist's finest creations.Of Dickens' work, the eminent Victorian critic John Ruskin had this to say: \"He is entirely right in his main drift and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but especially Hard Times, should be studied with close and earnest care by persons interested in social questions.\"",
