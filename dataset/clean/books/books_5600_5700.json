For the better part of three decades, the enormously popular host of \"The Tonight Show\" was welcomed into millions of American homes -- as a friend, an entertainer, and an inexhaustibly sage and witty commentator on our lives and times. But there was a dark side to this charming and inscrutable enigma that only those closest to Carson ever saw -- a sadness, mistrust, and cruelty behind the glitter and glamour, intensified by a lifelong pursuit of power, wealth, and fame. Based on more than two years of intensive research including more than 700 personal interviews with ex-wives, ex-friends, colleagues, and celebrities -- with all-new, never-before-published material on Johnny's post-\"Tonight Show\" life, from his retirement through his final days -- Laurence Learner's King of the Night is an intimate and powerful portrait of an unforgettable personality, at once a tribute and a revelation.",

The embittered wife wants out - with alimony. It's the kind of manhunt Hope's associates Chambers, Kiley, & Lamb can normally handle with their private eyes closed.But that is before a corpse turns up on a Calusa beach with Jack Lawton's ID in his pocket. Hope should have remembered the first axiom of being a criminal lawyer: the client always hides something...such as the kinky, sizzling sex life this Jack and Jill preferred. Instead Hope asks for help from cops up north where Jack Lawton was last seen, and starts snooping around the Sunshine State himself. Here some slimy critters hide in the deep eddies and local watering holes. And here Hope, shaky from the gunshot wounds he barely survived, suddenly has second thoughts about tangling with them.",

        "Description": "Children's welfare is the driving force behind Dr. Laura Schlessinger's mission. A devoted mother to her son, Deryk, she identifies herself as \"her kid's mom\" because that's her most important job.Never one to shy away from tough truths, Dr. Laura marshalls compelling evidence for the widespread neglect of America's children and convincingly condemns the numerous rationalizations to excuse it. Parents, special interest groups, and professionals in education and psychology all contribute to a dangerous trend that places adult fulfillment above obligation to children. Parenthood by Proxy addresses the serious causes and effects of this national crisis, among them the high rate of divorce, serial marriages, single parenting, the premature sexualization of children, dual-career families, disdain for religion, the redefinition of immoral behavior as lifestyle choices, and societal intolerance for the concept of judgment.In Parenthood by Proxy, Dr. Laura exhorts parents to make their own children their top priority and, if necessary, to change their lives to do so. In her inimitable, straight-shooting style, Dr. Laura entreats parents to involve themselves in their children's hearts, minds, and souls, to cherish and protect them, and to commit to the essential task of teaching them right from wrong. She acknowledges that parents no longer get much support from neighbors or public and private institutions, but she urges mothers and fathers to work even harder to counteract the prevailing culture of selfishness and irresponsibility.Parenthood by Proxy covers all aspects of parenting, from childbearing to discipline, from multiple families to being role models. Dr. Laura also tackles such cultural and societal concerns as abortion, modern sexuality, drug and alcohol use, violence, discipline, and a child's right to privacy.Parenthood by Proxy is a passionate and provocative summation of the perils of parenting and a road map to safety for America's families.",

From the beginning of her professional career, she has carried on an affair with Agust\u00edn, the married director of her troupe--a romance that is going stale from overfamiliar lust and an absence of honesty.But when she begins a passionate liaison with the younger Manolo, Agust\u00edn's godson and a dancer of natural genius, an angry rivalry is sparked. Add to that the looming reassertion of her crippling disease and Carmen's vexed relations with her mother, one of the most exasperating parents in recent literature, and you have all the ingredients for a love story \u00e0 la Ana Castillo--equal parts soap opera, tragicomedy, and rhapsody. Laced with sarcastic asides and dead-on observations, Peel My Love Like an Onion is a universal work imbued with love's power to vex and exalt.",

All I can say is I&#39;m glad I never had to go up against Mia Hamm.\"-- Pel\u00e9For the more than seven million girls--from knobby-kneed tykes to high school and college stars--who are tearing across the country chasing a soccer ball and dreams of glory, there is one name that eclipses all others, male or female: Mia Hamm. With her cheetah-like acceleration and lightning bolt shot, Hamm has broken nearly every record in her sport, while galvanizing a whole new generation of fans and players. Go for the Goal  is not only the inspiring story of how a tiny suburban sprite became a global terror with a ball (and the world) at her feet--it&#39;s also a step-by-step or dribble-by-dribble guide for any kid with the all-American dream of making the team and becoming a champion.  Filled with personal anecdotes and fully illustrated with both action and instructional photos, Go for the Goal shows readers exactly how to master the silky skills and techniques that have made Hamm and her teammates the finest women&#39;s soccer team in the world.",

        "Description": "In 1846 America, a young, vibrant republic, was expanding in directions unimagined only a few years earlier. The nation plunged into war with Mexico and rushed to settle the West. The country saw the steady rise of cities, the expansion of the railroad, and the emergence of great works of literature and art. On August 10 of that year, in an act that embodied the country's buoyant mood, Congress accepted the bequest of Englishman James Smithson and established an institution dedicated to the \"increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"Marking the Smithsonian Institution's 150th anniversary, 1846 evokes the texture of American daily life, thought, and politics during a single influential year. In a narrative accompanied by nearly two hundred illustrations, Margaret Christman revisits a capital dominated by Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, and James K. Polk and follows the westward journeys of Brigham Young, Francis Parkman, and the ill-fated Donner party. Moving from the Transcendentalists to the Hudson River School, from Gothic Revival architecture to anesthesia and the sewing machine, Christman chronicles as well the antislavery movement and other social-reform campaigns that expanded the nation's conscience and changed its future.",

        "Description": "Miami, Florida - one of America's most exotic and dangerous cities - is journalist Edna Buchanan's beat. In the widely acclaimed The Corpse Had a Familiar Face and Never Let Them See You Cry, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Miami Herald reporter took her readers through the dark underbelly of the Sunshine State, where murder, drugs, and corruption are as common as sand on the beaches.Now, Buchanan brings her years of hard-won experience, her unflinching eye, and her warm and witty prose style to bear in her powerful new novel. In Contents Under Pressure, she combines the best ingredients of suspense writing - seat-of-the-pants action, an intelligent and beautiful protagonist, and a complicated murder - and heats them up under a Miami sun for a thrillingly combustible outcome. Britt Montero is a crime reporter for a major Miami newspaper, and an oddity in a man's domain - a blonde, green-eyed Cuban-American woman tough enough to investigate even the most terrifying of homicides, but with a tender spot for the city's underdogs. The latest report to come in seems fairly cut and dried: several cops on the midnight shift chase a black motorist, and the fleeing man, a former football hero, winds up dead.However, as Britt begins her story on the accident, she discovers a number of disturbing facts about that night. Despite warnings to stay away, she starts to investigate what really happened - taking the reader from the high-intensity atmosphere of the newsroom to riding on the midnight beat with the cops, to the outraged black community that threatens to erupt into violence. Along the way she consorts with her own network of contacts, both solid citizens and nefarious nightbirds - and takes on a forbidden lover, a man she may not be able to trust. As the city explodes in a riot, Britt is caught up in events that bring the novel to a heart-shuddering climax. Contents Under Pressure is an immensely satisfying read, one that will leave its audience craving more.",

Against the backdrop of World War Two and the American land before and since, this remarkably told saga of the Doigs and their journey from a defense housing project in boomtime Arizona to the high country of their Montana origins builds with the drama only real life can hold. Here we see an adventurous mother miraculously back again in the evocative lines of her wartime letters after \"all else of her. . . has been only farthest childscapes, half-rememberings thinned by so many years since\"; a resonant father who gives off the \"tense hum of a wire in the wind\" as he strives, in memorably go-getting fashion, to make his family secure against chronic odds; and a child, \"touchy and thorough, doctrinaire and dreamy,\" who early learns to infiltrate the drama-filled world of grown-ups by \"standing back and prowling with the ears.\"\"In that last winter of the war, she knew to use pointblank ink,\" begins this unusual blend of heartfelt memoir and narrative skills. As ever in the writing of Ivan Doig, the most innocent sentence has the trap of poetry. Heart Earth is the most imaginative - and moving - book yet from the writer, The Washington Post has said, \"whose work makes readers recall why they love to read, reminds writers why they ever wanted to write in the first place.\"",

Seed of Doubt marks a departure from the earlier books in the series, known for their humor, humanity, and grasp of religious issues. More rich and complex than ever before, McInerny's latest effort weaves past and present motives and events, plunging Father Dowling into the heart of the conflicted Sinclair family.Margaret Sinclair, a wealthy dowager and member of Dowling's parish, dies suddenly and suspiciously, a full oxygen tank easily within her reach, her private nurse out of earshot. The owner of a collection of landscape paintings by a famous American artist, Sinclair herself appeared in one of the few portraits the artist ever painted. As the family squabbles over the contents of the will, it becomes clear to Father Dowling that neither the old woman's life nor her death was ordinary. Then a second death occurs in the Sinclair mansion, and a tragic mystery from the old woman's youthful honeymoon reemerges to affect her heirs. Both are somehow connected to the portraits, as Father Dowling probes for the truth about a complicated family.",

        "Description": "He is an Icon of the American airwaves, a face and a voice we have been welcoming into our homes for the past half-century. Through times of great upheaval and interludes of business as usual, we have tuned in to David Brinkley's programs on NBC and now on ABC - The Huntley-Brinkley Report, David Brinkley's Journal, This Week with David Brinkley - for his sense of fairness and his distinctive ability to cut through cant and pretension. We know that when he delivers the news it will be cogent, trustworthy and stamped with his trademark sardonic wit. Since his arrival in Washington in 1943 we have heard our history unfold in his unmistakable North Carolina cadences, yet in an age of information overload he is deeply appreciated for being a professional talker who doesn't believe in talking too much.Rich in anecdote and humor, David Brinkley's is a classic American story that overlaps with some of the great events and great personages of our era. He shares priceless moments, public and private: playing poker with Harry Truman, riding the rails with Winston Churchill, being whisked off by helicopter to Camp David by Lyndon Johnson, receiving the Medal of Freedom from George Bush, walking the beach with D Day veterans. And he takes aim at some chronic American bugbears - including taxes and political conventions - from his own, uniquely Brinkley, vantage point.",

It's the spring of 1877 in Washington, D.C., and at the U.S. Naval Observatory, Hugh Allison's plan to project an image through time and space takes on urgent life when the mathematically gifted Cynthia May enters his orbit as one of the observatory's human \"computers.\" But the fate of Hugh's heavenly vision-and of his love affair with Cynthia, a Civil War widow whose beauty has been shadowed by worry and poverty-may be out of his hands, decided instead by an astrologer and by the actions of a dangerously magnetic politician. Thomas Mallon's moving romance mixes actual historical figures with fictional ones. By combining earthly matters-such as politics and money-with heavenly ones of love and immortality, Mallon evokes a distant time and place with astonishing immediacy and confirms his place as one of our most original and delightful writers.",

Ladies' Man shows how the things he so cleverly manipulated to fuel his fame and fortune eventually came back to haunt him.Award-winning author John A. Jenkins brings to life the sensational trials in which Mitchelson made his mark - from his historic arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court, to the palimony trial of Michelle Triola Marvin and the divorce case of sultry actress Joan Collins.But Ladies' Man also goes beyond the courtroom and behind Mitchelson's celebrity mask by describing the renowned lawyer's darker side, including his sexual escapades with clients and others, his drug use, his financial troubles, and his problems with the legal establishment. Also included are observations and insights from Mitchelson himself, derived from extensive interviews by the author. And perhaps most important, Ladies' Man probes into how the authorities handled the many complaints about Mitchelson, and asks how America's most visible lawyer evaded, for so many years, those who could have stopped him.",
