        "Description": "Here is another volume from today's most influential writer on food and health, the New York Times Personal Health columnist, Jane E. Brody. In this new book, America's authority on great food that is also good food has produced, with her collaborator Richard Flaste, a primer on seafood combined with a collection of delicious recipes. She notes that most of us, when growing up, knew fish in one of two incarnations - fish sticks or tuna on rye. What we didn't know was that seafood comes in an amazing variety of forms, that it is one of the most important low-fat sources of dietary protein available, and that it can be cooked easily, even by \"fish novices,\" in an almost infinite number of delicious ways that go well beyond the frozen fillets of childhood.Part One is a comprehensive overview of seafood lore that includes chapters on how to select, clean, fillet, and store fish; basic seafood cooking techniques; and a full discussion of seafood safety and the overwhelming health benefits of adding fish to your diet. Part Two is a collection of 240 recipes for hors d'oeuvres and appetizers, soups, salads, and main courses, including special sections on grilling and microwaving.",

When she suddenly discovered a  belief in God, she had no idea what to do next.  In Holy Unexpected she describes her journey from a  privileged New York childhood through years of unhappiness,  drugs, and drift. She investigates what she believed  in before she believed in God (the healing power of junk  food, music, psychopharmacology), and how a happy  marriage impelled her toward a higher power. When she  discovers that Judaism embraces arguing with God, hot  sex, and acts as opposed to beliefs, she embarks on a  journey to reconstruct her Jewish heritage and forge a  relationship with her faith.  Robin wrestles with the meaning of Torah, discovers  how to keep the Sabbath and still go to Walmart for  duct tape, and learns to pray while snowboarding. But her  real education in the meaning of Judaism occurs as she  rides the ups and downs of day-to-day life, and prepares  both for her bat mitzvah and for her father's death.  Writing with enormous humor and intimacy,  Chotzinoff takes readers on an unexpected religious  journey lit by humor and grace.",

        "Authors": "By Wolfe, Suzanne M.",
        "Description": "Winner of Christianity Today Award of Merit for Fiction 2005!  Awarded 2005 Honorable Mention for First Time Author of a Book by the Catholic Press Association! When Rachel Piers, a brilliant young conservateuse at a Manhattan art gallery, is given the dream assignment of restoring a mysterious medieval painting in a church in Rome, she seizes the opportunity. Not only will she advance her career in one of the most inspiring and romantic cities in the world, but she can finally leave behind a bitter divorce and an even more painful childhood incident. But as Rachel meticulously restores the damaged artwork, and slowly discovers the true origins of the painting, she uncovers layers of her soul that she would rather be kept hidden. Written in lucid and descriptively sumptuous prose, Unveiling brings the ancient city of Rome vividly to life and reveals a courageous woman coming to terms with a tragic past. AN INTERVIEW WITH SUZANNE WOLFE What (or who) was your inspiration for the main character, Rachel Piers?  I was drawn to the name of Rachel because of the Old Testament reference and the allusion to it in \"Moby Dick\" where the ship is described as \"Rachel weeping for all her children\" (paraphrase). Rachel came to me primarily as a visual image of a woman by the early twentieth century painter Modigliani\u00e2??elongated, dark, intense, mournful. How long did it take you to write this novel? I began writing it almost 10 years ago when my 3 oldest children were 8 and under. Caring for my children and teaching senior high school literature during the day necessitated my working at night when my kids were in bed and I had finished my assignments for school. Thus, I mostly wrote between midnight and 3am, getting up at 7am, teaching until 1pm and then doing the mom thing until the cycle repeated itself! Are any of the struggles of the main character, Rachel Piers (physical violation, betrayal of relationships, repressed emotions) based on experiences from your own life? Like Rachel, my own experience of post-traumatic stress disorder has taught me that the body itself has a memory and is sometimes wiser than the head. The body reminds us that we have to go through suffering in order to heal and move on with our lives. You tackle many complicated and traumatic issues in this one character's life. What does this book say to readers about the soul's ability to heal from trauma? I am interested in the theme of grief and how this can change us for better or for worse. One cannot go around suffering; one has to go through it. Flannery O'Connor once said that being ill (she had lupus) was like living in a country, it was so encompassing. I think grief is like that. Once one crosses the border into grief, one must journey across it in order to leave it behind. Unveiling brings the city of Rome vividly to life. Did you travel to Rome while writing the book? I went to Rome after I had written the first draft of the novel and before I reworked it. I found the experience to be invaluable. I spent most of the two weeks there walking around looking, listening, smelling, tasting Rome, and taking un-touristy pictures of trash cans, graffiti, cobblestones, pigeons etc.\u00e2??the details of the city. Is art history/restoration a field of personal significance to you? What is your own background with art? I am not only fascinated with art, but also medieval history. The triptych gave me the opportunity to combine both loves and to learn the painstaking and intricate process of art conservation. Praise for Unveiling: \"With an imaginative vision akin to that of Dante,",

And yet Claire's tangled interior life gives the lie to that illusion. She is prone to vivid speculation about the lives of others, and to fantasies about her own fate that lead her into a courtship so strange that even she wonders at its power to compel her. Martin Gibson and his chronically ill wife Cynthia come to depend on Claire to an extent that is nothing short of baffling, and yet Claire becomes ever bolder in her pursuit of their acquaintance-and, ultimately, of Martin's elusive affections. The result, a potent tale of urban loneliness and the chance intersections that assuage it, constitutes one of Brookner's finest and most psychologically acute achievements.",

        "Title": "Any Child Can Write: An At Home Guide to Enhancing Your Childs Elementary Education",
        "Authors": "By Wiener, Harvey S.",
        "Description": "Writing is a magical realm of expression that allows children to come to terms with the joys and pains of daily living. It is a way for them to explore the inner self. A few words, a few sentences glow on a page like a little crayon drawing. It is an expression of personal vision, a perception of the world as the child sees it. It is also a permanent record of experience--words and sentences holding and keeping the essence of a moment in language.    In this delightful and engaging book, Dr. Harvey S. Wiener shows how parents can encourage their children to write with a home program that can be used from preschool through high school. As Dr. Wiener explains, such a program begins with the building of attitudes and moves through simple, varied, and practical experience with the written word. By setting up an atmosphere in the home that encourages creative written expression, coupled with a parent's guidance in writing (guidance that often falls short in many schools), children will gain an outlook on writing that will build confidence in their abilities to use language.     Children learn by imitation, and there are countless opportunities for a child to watch an adult performing simple writing tasks everyday. For example, lists are some of the most accessible day-to-day writing activities. Dr. Wiener shows that children of any grade level can work with an adult to put together a list: for family groceries, the next birtday party, a list of toys to take on a visit to Grandma's. And, as the child grows older the list can be adapted to his or her own interest and needs: a schedule of activities for after school, or a list of expenses to keep track of weekly allowance or money earned babysitting. Other enjoyable and easy writing experiences are room signs (Peter's Room), labels affixed to objects throughout the child's bedroom (window, closet, desk), birthday notes to parents, brothers, and sisters that can be displayed on the refrigerator, table, or bedroom door, and, with a home computer,  children can make signs for every holiday and celebration (Happy Thanksgiving, Happy Anniversary). Dr. Wiener goes on to offer ideas on how to use riddles, games, and rhymes to build vocabulary, and how to use a small child's crayon drawing as an inspiration for his or her first written communication.     Children love words, says Dr. Wiener; they are natural storytellers. In general, however, their writing skills seem to be getting poorer. This is due in part to to television, movies, tape and disk players, and other technological advances. Dr. Wiener insists that this can be overcome. Parents are a child's best teacher, and this wonderful book shows just how simple it is for a parent to help their child draw upon ordinary experiences and put them down on paper. He offers helpful hints for working with a child on homework, an entertaining list of one hundred ideas for writing at home for all ages, a special parents' refresher guide to the basics of grammar in clear, simple language--so parents can spot mistakes--and a reading list for young readers and their parents.    Written in a warm and engaging style by a renowned educational authority, Any Child Can Write will allow parents to instill positive attitudes toward writing in any child. Encouraging a child to write is giving the gift of communication. This fascinating book will help parent's give the gift of a lifetime.",

Or can you safely treat the discomfort at home and save the expense of an office visit?If you learn to recognize your body's health warnings, you can help add healthy, productive years to your life. But how can you recognize these natural signals?At last, in this revolutionary new volume from the editors of Prevention Magazine Health Books, you can look up the symptom, instantly find out what may be causing the condition (it's often NOT what you think) and find a complete list of the safest, fastest and most effective cures.Since the advice is arranged alphabetically by symptom name rather than by some fancy medical term, you'll find the information you need fast. First, you'll see a \"medical alert\" - a list of warning signs that warrant a doctor's attention. Next, you'll learn how to decode the symptom and its probable cause. Most important, for each symptom you'll find a \"relief\" section that includes a whole spectrum of healing techniques and medically proven advice from 450 top doctors and health experts!If a doctor's visit is called for, you'll be aware of what your symptoms might mean. You'll know what questions to ask and feel more confident that you're getting the best possible remedies: up-to-the-minute healing techniques - over 1,500 fast-acting, doctor-approved remedies; hundreds of common symptoms and conditions covered; and sound advice on when to see your doctor.Since learning to recognize the body's early warning signs can help ward off, or even reverse, a host of dangerous conditions, Symptoms: Their Causes and Cures is an essential family reference. Like no other health book ever published, it puts you in touch with your own body and in control of your own health and the health of those who depend on you.",

That sorcerous treasury remains sealed because of the spell cast by Giyan and her sister. A spell to migrate Annon Ashera's male V'ornn psyche into Riane's dying Kundalan female body. By combining them into a single being, it saved them both and fulfilled the prophecy that the Dar Sala-at would be \"born at both ends of the cosmos.\" But the spell also breached the Abyss, releasing daemons who could wreak havoc on Kundala. The daemons were imprisoned there aeons ago by the Goddess Miina. Now the fiends must be vanquished, not only so the quest for the Pearl can continue, but to save Giyan, who has been possessed by the archdaemon Horolaggia. Their only hope is the fabled Veil of A Thousand Tears.",

        "Authors": "By Williams, Marjorie and Noah, Timothy (EDT)",
        "Description": "Marjorie Williams knew Washington from top to bottom. Beloved for her sharp analysis, elegant prose and exceptional ability to intuit character, Williams wrote political profiles for the Washington Post and Vanity Fair that came to be considered the final word on the capital's most powerful figures. Her accounts of playing ping-pong with Richard Darman, of Barbara Bush's stepmother quaking with fear at the mere thought of angering the First Lady, and of Bill Clinton angrily telling Al Gore why he failed to  win the presidency ? to name just three treasures collected here ? open a window on a seldom-glimpsed human reality behind Washington's determinedly blank fa\u00e7ade.  Williams also penned a weekly column for the Post's op-ed page and epistolary book reviews for the online magazine Slate. Her essays for these and other publications tackled subjects ranging from politics to parenthood. During the last years of her life, she wrote about her own  mortality as she battled liver cancer, using this harrowing experience to illuminate larger points about the nature of power and the randomness of life.  Marjorie Williams was a woman in a man's town, an  outsider reporting on the political elite. She was, like the narrator in Randall Jarrell's classic poem, \"The Woman at the Washington Zoo,\" an observer of a strange and exotic culture. This splendid collection ? at once insightful, funny  and sad ? digs into the psyche of the nation's capital, revealing not only the hidden selves of the people that run it, but the messy lives that the rest of us lead.",

        "Title": "Invisible Acts of Power: Personal Choices That Create Miracles",
        "Authors": "By Myss, Caroline",
        "Description": "For more than two decades, internationally renowned pioneer in energy medicine Caroline Myss has been studying how people use their personal power. Through her special brand of spiritual insight and intuition, her popular workshops, and her bestselling books, Myss has helped hundreds of thousands of people meet the lifelong challenge of managing their spiritual energy and improving their lives.  Now, in this inspiring new book, Myss expands her message about power in an entirely new spiritual direction. With characteristic originality, she explains how we become channels for divine grace and a conduit for miracles through kind, compassionate, generous actions or, as she calls them, invisible acts of power. When we act compassionately, without a private agenda or expectation of credit or reward, God works invisibly, anonymously through us. And as we move from visible acts, such as giving a friend a helping hand, to invisible acts, such as prayer and healing, we undergo a profound journey of personal empowerment.  Myss explores the seven stages of the practice of compassion and generosity and shows that the choice to do good, to act in service to others, is as essential to our physical and emotional health as it is to our intuitive development. In fact, she reveals, generosity is a biological and a spiritual necessity.  As she conveys these insights, Myss tells her trademark electrifying personal stories along with numerous others about life-changing acts of service, chosen from among more than twelve hundred letters that were sent to her Web site. The myriad simple but profound ways that people connect to create small miracles, gain a greater sense of spirituality, and transform their own -- and others' -- lives in an instant will inspire you to your own invisible acts of power...and attract them to you.",

His assignment: a series of articles on the Allied occupation. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. When he stumbles onto a murder - an American soldier has washed up on a lakeshore on the conference grounds - he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story.What Jake finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation. After twelve years of Nazi rule, six years of war, and months of brutal treatment by the Russians, Berlin has finally arrived at zero hour, a city not only physically but morally devastated. Children scavenge for food in the rubble, sex can be had for a cigarette, and heirlooms are traded for cans of PX rations. American GIs, flush with black market money, live in requisitioned villas and fraternize in underground jazz clubs; meanwhile, the air remains thick with mortar dust, and corpses still float in the canals. Berlin in July 1945 is like nowhere else - a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world.And nothing is simple. As Jake searches the ruins for Lena, he discovers that years of war have led to unimaginable displacement and degradation. As he hunts for the soldier's killer, he learns that Berlin has become a city of secrets, a lunar landscape that seethes with social and political tension. When the two searches become entangled, Jake comes to understand that the American Military Government is already fighting a new enemy in the east, busily identifying the \"good Germans\" who can help with the next war. And hanging over everything is the larger crime, a crime so huge that it seems - the worst irony - beyond punishment.",

        "Description": "Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806\u20131861), English poet and wife of the poet Robert Browning, is perhaps best known for her remarkable series of 44 love poems Sonnets from the Portuguese. Published in 1850, they were written by Mrs. Browning to her husband during the early years of their relationship. Their obvious sincerity, gentleness, and passion and the devotion and gratitude they express have made the poems popular favorites with generations of readers.Mrs. Browning, however, addressed a wide range of other concerns, and this rich selection also includes poems dealing with religion, art, social problems, and political events. Among such works included here are: \"Cheerfulness Taught by Reason,\" \"A Curse for a Nation,\" \"The Forced Recruit,\" \"Grief,\" \"A Musical Instrument,\" \"The Cry of the Human,\" and many others.",

        "Title": "The Trial and Death of Socrates: Four Dialogues (Dover Thrift Editions: Philosophy)",
        "Authors": "By Plato",
        "Description": "The Dialogues of Plato (427\u2013347 B.C.) rank with the writings of Aristotle as the most important and influential philosophical works in Western thought. In them Plato cast his teacher Socrates as the central disputant in colloquies that brilliantly probe a vast spectrum of philosophical ideas and issues. None is more exciting and revelatory than the four dialogues \u2014 Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo \u2014 on themes evoked by the trial and death of Socrates, accused by his enemies and detractors of crimes against the state, among them \"impiety\" and \"corruption of the young.\"In Euthyphro, Socrates explores the concepts and aims of piety and religion: in Apology, he courageously defends the integrity of his teachings; in Crito, he demonstrates his respect for the law in his refusal to flee his death sentence; and in Phaedo embraces death and discusses the immortality of the soul. The four dialogues are presented here in the authoritative translation by the distinguished classical scholar Benjamin Jowett, renowned for his translations of Plato.",

        "Description": "Lee Bailey's acquaintance with berries has blossomed into a flavorful friendship over the years. From the season's first strawberries of Pontchatula, Louisiana, in days gone by, to the abundant yield of his own raspberry patch on Long Island, he has indulged in the delightful and diverse tastes of these vine-ripened morsels.Berries is Lee's ode to strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries. Beginning with classic shortcake - topped with the traditional strawberries and whipped cream or smothered with mixed berries and warm cream - Lee delves into recipes for a personal favorite blackberry cobbler, a sumptuous cross between a cake and a crumble called blueberry buckle, and a deliciously messy strawberry cake. But it's not just desserts! There are also suggestions for serving berries with meats and in salads, including berry dumplings to serve with stews and a blackberry sauce to spoon over poultry, and berry salsas, flavored vodkas, butters, and hot and cold souffles. There's even a soothing health face mask!",

The Haas family murders left a scar on the community nothing can erase, but everyone agrees that convicting the killer, Karl Dahl, is a start. Only Judge Carey Moore seems to be standing in the way. Her ruling that Dahl\u2019s prior criminal record is inadmissible raises a public outcry\u2014and puts the judge in grave danger.When an unknown assailant attacks Judge Moore in a parking garage, two of Minneapolis\u2019s top cops are called upon to solve the crime and keep the judge from further harm. Detective Sam Kovac is as hard-boiled as they come, and his wisecracking partner, Nikki Liska, isn\u2019t far behind. Neither one wants to be on this case, but when Karl Dahl escapes from custody, everything changes, and a seemingly straightforward case cartwheels out of control.The stakes go even higher when the judge is kidnapped\u2014snatched out of her own bed even as the police sit outside, watching her house.  Now Kovac and Liska must navigate through a maze of suspects that includes the stepson of a murder victim, a husband with a secret life, and a rogue cop looking for revenge where the justice system failed.With no time to spare, the detectives are pulled down a strange dark trail of smoke and mirrors, where no one is who they seem and everyone is guilty of Prior Bad Acts.",

It's an exhilarating life ... until the day two deaths shake their world.The first is the jumper. Five stories up, perched on the ledge of a hotel window, dark pants, white shirt, just standing there - and then he's gone, falling through the air toward their cameras. The second is Jason, one of Anna's cameramen. Strangely affected by the jumper, he quits the scene early that night, not to be seen again until his body turns up on the beach several hours later, shot in the head. The police wonder if it's drug-related, but Anna isn't so sure, and the more she looks into it on her own, the more the ghosts of the past - hers, Jason's, and finally the jumper's - begin to emerge, until her whole world turns as dark and dangerous as the night itself.",
