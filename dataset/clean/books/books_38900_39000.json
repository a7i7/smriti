Leeds.They Call Me Naughty Lola is a testament to the creativity and humor that can still be found among men and women longing for love and allergic to the concepts of Internet and speed dating. Here is an irresistible collection of the most brilliant and often absurd personal ads from the world's funniest -- and most erudite -- lonely-hearts column. The ads have been called \"surreal haikus of the heart,\" and in an age of false advertising, the men and women who write them are hindered neither by high expectations nor by positivism of any kind. And yet, while hopes of finding a suitable mate remain low, the column has produced a handful of marriages, many friendships, and at least one divorce.Here are the young, old, fat, bald, healthy, ill, rich, and poor hoping that they can find true love, or at the very least, someone to call them Naughty Lola.",

        "Authors": "By Murray, William",
        "Description": "H. L. Mencken declared that \u201cthe opera is to music what a bawdy house is to a cathedral.\u201d It was not meant as a compliment, but to William Murray, former New Yorker staff writer and aspiring opera singer, a bawdy house is an apt metaphor for the opera: a place of confusion, high and low drama, fleshly pleasures and raucous song.In Fortissimo, Murray follows twelve young singers in the Lyric Opera of Chicago\u2019s training program, the prestigious Opera Center for American Artists, through the 2003\u20132004 season. In the course of the year, these singers attend countless coaching sessions, inspiring master classes, nerve-racking auditions and grueling rehearsals\u2014and finally perform with some of the most celebrated names (and spectacular egos) in opera, from Samuel Ramey to Jos\u00e9 Cura and Natalie Dessay. While chronicling their progress, Murray offers an insider\u2019s look at the different aspects of the opera world that influence a young singer\u2019s success, a world filled with temperamental maestros, ambitious directors, old-world tradition and sacred monsters. Weaving recollections of his own days training in New York, Rome and Milan in the 1950s with the personal and artistic struggles of the young singers in Chicago today, Murray lays bare the staggering ambition and relentless will required to achieve a career in the arts. As he writes, \u201cBecoming a successful opera singer\u2014stepping out on a huge stage to try to fill the house with your voice, to bring an audience of thirty-six hundred people to its feet\u2014is as risky in its own peculiar way as embarking on a career as a matador. You can triumph, you can struggle to survive or you can perish from your wounds.\u201d Fortissimo is a delicious tale of rising talents, angst and heartache and small triumphs, and the music that inspires it all.",

        "Description": "Ever in control, H. L. Mencken contrived that future generations would see his life as he desired them to. He even wrote Happy Days, Newspaper Days, and other books to fit the pictures he wanted: first, the carefree Baltimore boy; then, the delighted, exuberant critic of American life.But he told only part of the truth. Over the past twenty-five years - since the last Mencken biography - vital collections of the writer's papers have become available, including his literary correspondence, a 2,100-page diary, equally long manuscripts about his literary and journalistic careers, and numerous accumulations of his personal correspondence. The letters and diaries of Mencken's intimates have been uncovered as well.Now Fred Hobson has used this newly accessible material to fashion the first truly comprehensive portrait of this most original of American originals: a man who was so unhappy in his teens that he contemplated suicide, who taught himself German in order to write on Nietzsche, who considered himself as much European as American; a literary lion who, without benefit of academic training, compiled renowned volumes on the American language; a man of hates and loves, of passions and prejudices - all portrayed in intimate, elegant detail in this landmark biography.",

        "Description": "You will never look at the world in the same way after reading As the Future Catches You. Juan Enriquez puts you face to face with a series of unprecedented political, ethical, economic, and financial issues, dramatically demonstrating the cascading impact of the genetic, digital, and knowledge revolutions on your life. Genetics will be the dominant language of this century. Those who can \u201cspeak it\u201d will acquire direct and deliberate control over all forms of life. But most countries and individuals remain illiterate in what is rapidly becoming the greatest single driver of the global economy. Wealth will be more concentrated and those with knowledge to sell\u2013both countries and individuals\u2013will be the winners. Consider what will happen when:\u2022 Your genetic code can be digitally imprinted on an ID card and your insurance company and employer see that you are genetically disposed to, say, heart disease.\u2022 Pharmaceutical products are developed so that you can eat genetically modified broccoli to protect yourself from cancer.\u2022 Cloning will be as common as in vitro fertilization and scientists can influence the genetic design not only of other species but of your own children.\u2022 Creating wealth no longer requires many hands. Lone individuals are giving birth to entire new industries that rapidly become bigger than the economies of most countries on earth, but create very few jobs.As the Future Catches You resembles no other book. A typical page may contain just a few dozen words. But each seemingly discrete fact is like a chip in an intellectual mosaic that reveals its meaning and beauty only as you step back and see the big picture. Juan Enriquez is like the best teacher you ever had, one who helps you to see something in a new light and makes you say, \u201cNow I get it!\u201d Juan Enriquez\u2019s main point is that technology is not kind, it does not say \u201cplease,\u201d but slams into existing systems and destroys them while creating new ones. Countries and individuals can either surf new and powerful waves of change\u2013or get crushed trying to stop them.The future is catching us all. Let it catch you with your eyes wide open.",

        "Description": "H. L. Mencken's diary was, at his own request, kept sealed in the vaults of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Library for a quarter of a century after his death. The diary covers the years 1930 -- 1948, and provides a vivid, unvarnished, sometimes shocking picture of Mencken himself, his world, and his friends and antagonists, from Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, and William Faulkner to Franklin D. Roosevelt, for whom Mencken nourished a hatred that resulted in spectacular and celebrated feats of invective.From the more than 2,000 pages of typescript that have now come to light, the Mencken scholar Charles A. Fecher has made a generous selection of entries carefully chosen to preserve the whole range, color, and impact of the diary. Here, full scale, is Mencken the unique observer and disturber of American society. And here too is Mencken the human being of wildly contradictory impulses: the skeptic who was prey to small superstitions, the dare-all warrior who was a hopeless hypochondriac, the loving husband and generous friend who was, alas, a bigot.Mencken emerges from these pages unretouched -- in all the often outrageous gadfly vitality that made him, at his brilliant best, so important to the intellectual fabric of American life",

The best of his columns, collected here, reflect an uncommon zest for gardening, along with more good advice than you can find in a dozen how-to books. In fact, as he says, \"If gardeners spent less time running about doing things they think they are supposed to do and more time contemplating the beauty of the world's plants, they'd get more out of their gardens and be less of a pest to the civilized world.\"Whether he is being serious (\"Tea Roses: The Secrets of Success\") or hilarious (\"Before You Bring In the Plants, Make Sure Your Rugs Are Clean\"), Mitchell deftly deals with the likely and unlikely decisions a gardener is called upon to make every day. While rationing a precious Christmas gift of fertilizer, he observes that horse manure, like youth, goes all too quickly.\"When you first start to garden,\" he writes, \"you usually have no idea what the real delights are going to be.\" Henry Mitchell shares both his delights and his agonies, whether he is happily hoarding pickle jars for growing seedlings or agitating over which plants to uproot and toss out of his garden.",

Under the influence of the obese, loose-moraled Prince of Wales (to whom Jane Austen dedicated Emma), the Regency was the apex of British decadence, an era of lavish parties and relentless bed-hopping that set a standard for elegance and vulgarity. With wit and lively style, Venetia Murray chronicles the scandals, courtships, and daily life of these aristocrats, and evokes the tempestuous times of the early industrial and French revolutions. Sumptuously illustrated with rare contemporary cartoons, prints, diaries, and  caricatures, An Elegant Madness is a book readers of social history and historical romance alike will devour.",

When Clare Layton's actress mother leaves her husband and two small daughters to go off with her lover, their picture-perfect Hollywood family is shattered. Gone are the star-studded parties, the photo-op outings to Palm Springs. Father and daughters are left to cope and hang on, but finally Clare's older sister, Louise, also drifts away. Years pass without a word or sighting, and then Louise mysteriously reappears, hoping to enlist Clare in a medical quest to save her oldest, evangelical teenage son. Louise's reappearance plunges Clare back into her childhood in the early 60s and into a reckoning with her current role as single career woman and devoted mistress to a married politico. As Clare works toward a sense of peace and personal redemption, the novel examines religion and politics, forgiveness and reconciliation, and the deep tethers between long-estranged sisters trying to find their way back.",

These questions take him back to the basic process of design from which all structures begin, from the realization of a need for the structure to the struggles of the engineers and designers to map out and create the final construction.     As only he can, David Macaulay engages readers\u2019 imaginations and gets them thinking about structures they see and use every day \u2014 bridges, tunnels, skyscrapers, domes, and dams. In Building Big he focuses on the connections between the planning and design problems and the solutions that are finally reached. Whether a structure is imposing or inspiring, he shows us that common sense and logic play just as important a part in architecture as imagination and technology do. As always, Macaulay inspires readers of all ages to look at their world in a new way.",

From teeming docks to overflowing market stalls, from grand homes to grimy narrow alleyways, cholera microbes rise and bob in streams of water and tiny droplets, clinging to moisture as man clings to air.With a keen mind and dedication to his work, young Louis Thuillier has impressed his mentor\u2014famed scientist Louis Pasteur\u2014enough to be sent to Alexandria as one-third of the French mission searching for the source of the cholera that is terrorizing the city. Along with the other members of the French mission\u2014scientists Emile Roux and Edmond Nocard and their enterprising servant Marcus\u2014Louis longs to find the cure, bringing glory to himself and to France. Este Malina is the lovely daughter of a respected Jewish doctor, whose family has lived in Alexandria for hundreds of years. A life of comfort has made Este a romantic, and she hopes to marry a man with the heart of a poet. Neither expects to find a soul mate in the other, but when Este begins to assist at the French mission\u2019s lab, a deep bond forms. Este, though, is engaged to another, and Louis is not Jewish\u2014her family would never allow them to marry.     In spite of their many differences, the lovers\u2019 desire grows and their fantasies threaten to distract them from their work. In Alexandria, the disease rages on, as mysterious as it was a thousand years before. Political intrigue threatens to separate Este and Louis permanently.

Radiohead stops listening to Pink Floyd and starts listening to Black Sabbath.If you've ever made, or conceived of, a list like this, then look no further for your next book purchase. You have it. In your hands. Please consider it as your next book purchase.In Perfect From Now On, John Sellers has written a fan's memoir overflowing with humor, self-deprecation, encyclopedic knowledge of musical minutiae, and \"you should have been there\" personal anecdotes. Despite vowing never to get caught up in music due to the nuttiness of a Dylan-obsessed father and playground taunts about his preference for Top 40 trash, he found himself powerless to resist the allure of indie rock, the genre that begat the likes of Sonic Youth, Pavement, Built to Spill, and Modest Mouse. When his favorite band, Guided By Voices, called it quits in 2004, Sellers examined his own listening habits, caught a few mind-blowing shows, got drunk with his heroes, and wrote this book -- one that is sure to resonate with anybody who has ever obsessed over good music.",

        "Description": "Shout it once! Shout it twice!Friends forever! Skog and mice!Since its publication in 1973, The Island of the Skog has been a favorite of children everywhere-and of the author himself! We're delighted to remind you of this beloved book on its thirtieth birthday. Jenny and her city-mouse friends take to the seas in search of a more peaceful place to live. But when they arrive at what first seems the island of their dreams, they have a giant problem to contend with: the island's only inhabitant, the Skog. Judging by his enormous footprints, he seems a more terrible threat than a hundred urban cats and dogs. How will the mice master their new domain?Funny, exciting and sweet, The Island of the Skog is a timeless tale of cooperation and compromise. It won the Michigan State Young Readers Award, and was included on Booklist's Books for Every Child and the CBC Books for Peace list.",
