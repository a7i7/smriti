        "Title": "The Miss Stone Affair: America's First Modern Hostage Crisis",
        "Authors": "By Carpenter, Teresa",
        "Description": "On September 3, 1901, Miss Ellen Stone, an American missionary, set out on horseback for a trek across the mountainous hinterlands of Balkan Macedonia. In a narrow gorge she was attacked by a band of masked men who carried her off the road and, more significantly, onto the path of history. Stone would become the first American captured for ransom on foreign soil.  In The Miss Stone Affair, master storyteller and Pulitzer Prize winner Teresa Carpenter re-creates the drama of this country's first modern hostage crisis -- an event that held the world's attention and dominated the headlines in American and European dailies for months. Using a wealth of contemporary correspondence and diplomatic cables, she constructs a narrative that is suspenseful, harrowing, and at times even comical.  On a journey that takes the reader from Boston's Beacon Hill to Constantinople and the bloody revolution-wracked nation-states of the Balkans, Carpenter introduces an unforgettable cast of characters: the strong-willed Miss Stone and her Bulgarian companion, Katerina Tsilka, who is brought along by the kidnappers -- in deference to Victorian convention -- as a chaperone; the terrorists who threaten to murder their hostages and yet are awed when Tsilka gives birth to a baby girl; the diplomat who sees the Stone case as a vehicle for his personal ambition; rival negotiators whom the terrorists pit one against the other; a media mogul obsessed with finding the hostages and securing their literary rights; and, of course, the new president, Theodore Roosevelt, who must decide if he should, as many of his countrymen are demanding, send warships to the Near East or if some quieter form of intervention might win the day.  Teresa Carpenter has produced a turn-of-the-century international thriller with precision, drama, and historical perspective. This is a story for our time.",

Now Watson returns to Montana 1948's vast landscape with a stunning prequel that illuminates the Hayden clan's early years and the circumstances that led to the events of Montana 1948.  In Montana, the Hayden name is law. For the Hayden boys, Wesley and Frank, their legacy carries an aura of privilege and power that doesn't stop at the Montana border, even when an ill-fated hunting trip makes them temporary outlaws. But what it means to bear the name is something each generation must discover for itself. From Julian, the hard-bitten and blustery patriarch, to Gail, Sheriff Wesley Hayden's spirited wife and moral compass, Larry Watson gives breath and blood to a remarkable family's struggles and rewards, and opens an evocative window on the very heart of the American West.",

Larry Weller, born in 1950, is an ordinary guy made extraordinary by his creator's perception, irony, and tenderness. Larry's Party gives us, as it were, a CAT scan of his life, in episodes between 1977 and 1997, that seamlessly flash backward and forward. We follow this young floral designer through two marriages and divorces, and his interactions with his parents, friends, and a son. Throughout, we witness his deepening passion for garden mazes--so like life, with their teasing treachery and promise of reward. Among all the paradoxes and accidents of his existence, Larry moves through the spontaneity of the seventies, the blind enchantment of the eighties, and the lean, mean nineties, completing at last his quiet, stubborn search for self. Larry's odyssey mirrors the male condition at the end of our century with targeted wit, unerring poignancy, and faultless wisdom.",

        "Description": "\u201cIt takes only nineteen seconds to walk the distance of the first powered flight. But when I was there the wind was up and cold on my face, and I felt as if I\u2019d entered the black-and-white photograph I\u2019d been seeing all my life. The sand is light gray, there\u2019s a spill of surf in the distance. Wilbur, running at the right of the plane, and Orville, the pilot, are in dark suits. The propellers blur against the sky as the machine rises. . . .\u201dSo begins Noah Adams\u2019s adventure in search of Wilbur and Orville Wright, a journey that takes him across the country as he follows in the footsteps of the famous brothers in an attempt to know them more deeply, not just as inventors and pilots but as individuals as well.Adams, one of our most distinctive and talented storytellers, traveled thousands of miles and interviewed scores of experts and individuals to piece together his story. He finds a local boat captain to ferry him to Kitty Hawk, along the same route that Wilbur took in 1900, and spends several days talking with descendants of the families who first welcomed the Wright brothers a century ago and helped them conduct their gliding experiments. To experience first-hand the thrill of being in the air, Adams himself goes hang-gliding in the Outer Banks. To understand the aerodynamics of lift and drag and how the famous 1903 plane was constructed, he visits Ken Hyde, a Virginia pilot and vintage aircraft builder who is creating the world\u2019s most accurate reproduction of the 1903 Wright Flyer. Adams goes to the prop shop and handles the tools and materials that the Wrights used to build their gliders and planes, and later he visits the wind tunnel at Langley Air Force Base where Hyde\u2019s reproduction was tested for the first time.He also travels to France to visit the old racetrack at Le Mans where Wilbur startled the European aviation community with his demonstration flights in 1908, and he spends a few days at Wisconsin\u2019s Oshkosh Fly-in, where builders of experimental aircraft and owners of vintage planes gather every year to dazzle the crowds.  Adams himself takes to the air in a restored Ford Tri-Motor, America\u2019s first airliner, which took its maiden flight seventy years ago.In Adams\u2019s book we encounter the Wright brothers in a way that no writer has introduced them before. Through the lens of his own experiences as well as original reporting, letters, diaries, and other primary source material, he helps us understand the talent and intensity of the brothers and their family, including the fascinating, deeply complex, and at times tragic bond between Orville and Katharine, his younger sister.The Flyers is a wonderfully rich narrative that brings an unprecedented spirit of immediacy to one of history\u2019s most dramatic stories.",

From her first renovation - the reclaiming of a 19th-century schoolhouse - to the complex restoration of her Federal-style farmhouse on Turkey Hill, Martha has endeavored to \"remove the unsightly and replace it with the beautiful.\" She often wished she had kept a complete record of her restoration efforts, so when the old Adams homestead in Connecticut became available, she decided not only to buy it and restore it, but also to record the experience. Martha Stewart's New Old House is the renovation journal Martha always wanted to keep.From the initial inspection of the historic but sadly \"down-at-the-heels\" Adams house to its completion as Martha's dream home, Martha Stewart's New Old House is the step-by-step story of exactly how she makes an old house \"new.\" This uniquely personal account guides homeowners (and would-be homeowners) through one of the most exciting and challenging projects they will ever undertake the restoration, renovation, and decoration of an old house.Reshingling the roof, rebuilding the foundation, repointing the chimneys, stripping the exterior for painting, framing new walls, installing a heating and cooling system, stripping wallpaper and paint, installing drywall, refinishing floors, restoring millwork - Martha explains it all, allowing the homeowner to work with the contractor and crew more effectively.Once the renovation of the Adams house was completed, Martha invited a talented group of designers and artisans to decorate the rooms. Here they explain their visions for the design and give step-by-step instructions for decorative techniques: marbleizing, designing a tile floor, painting a faux carpet, creating a trompe l'oeil wall mural - special touches that make a truly spectacular home.Finally, Martha leads the reader outside, where she explains how to preserve trees and shrubs, accent the property with evergreens, build a stone wall, and create a restful, fragrant herb garden, giving the house the perfect setting.Homeowners who choose to make major improvements in lieu of moving - and all those who buy old houses hoping to restore them to their original charm - can now benefit from Martha's practical knowledge, incomparable sense of style, and brilliant organizational skills. Delivered from start to finish with her personal flair and passion, Martha Stewart's New Old House is a compendium of essential information that is sure to inspire and motivate homeowners to create their very own dream house.",

Not long after that, shots are fired into the judge's house. It doesn't take much figuring to conclude that someone's out to get him and that malefactor isn't going to stop at the second try. There's a long list of suspects: Dale Crowe, who just got an outrageous sentence for a minor crime; his uncle Elvin, a killer on parole, raring to go again; Dr. Tommy Vasco, the drugged out former medical doctor; his equally bizarre friend, Hector; and Dicky Campau, who makes a living poaching alligators. And there are others.Somehow Kathy Baker, a nifty young probation officer, has got herself in the middle of all this. She's got to avoid two seducers--the judge and a homicidal maniac--and work with a young police officer who interests her for more than professional reasons. Trying to pick out from his assortment of bad guys, sociopaths, and punks the one who's trying to kill the judge is pure entertainment, as only Elmore Leonard, with his ear for the sound and eye for the sight of lowlife, can provide.From the Trade Paperback edition.",

        "Title": "Nicholas II: Last of the Tsars",
        "Authors": "By Ferro, Marc and Pearce, Brian (TRN)",
        "Description": "One of the world's preeminent historians, Marc Ferro is a leading member of the Annales School of France and a recognized authority on early twentieth-century European history. For well over two decades, in volumes such as The February Revolution of 1917 and October 1917, he has demonstrated an unsurpassed skill in capturing the social and political forces that led to the Russian Revolution. Now Ferro turns his considerable talents to the biography of one of the pivotal figures of that era, Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia.     For this important new biography, Ferro has searched extensively in Russian archives to illuminate Nicholas's character. What emerges is a vivid portrait of a reluctant leader, a young man forced by the death of his father into a role for which he was ill-equipped. A conformist and traditionalist, Nicholas admired the order, ritual, and ceremony identified with the intangible grandeur of autocracy, and he hated everything that might shake that autocracy--the intelligentsia, the Jews, the religious sects. His reign, as Ferro documents, was one of continual trouble: a humiliating war with Japan; the 1905 revolution that forced Nicholas to accept a constitutional assembly, the Duma; the international crisis of 1914, leading to World War I; and finally the Revolution of 1917, forcing his abdication. Throughout, we see a Tsar who was utterly opposed to change and to the ferment of ideas that stirred his country, who felt it was his duty to preserve intact the powers God had entrusted in him. Ferro also provides an intimate portrait of Nicholas's personal life: his wife Alexandra; his four daughters, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia, sisters so close they signed letters \"OTMA,\" the initials of their Christian names; his son and heir Alexis, who suffered from hemophilia; and the various figures in the court, most notably Rasputin, whose ability to revive the frequently ailing Alexis made him indispensable to the Tsaritsa.  (Ferro recounts that, when Alexandra heard of Rasputin's murder, she collapsed in anguish, certain her son was lost; but when Nicholas heard the news while with the army, he simply walked off whistling cheerfully.) Perhaps most intriguing is Ferro's chapter on the fate of the Tsar and his family, examining all the rumors and contradictory testimony that swirl around this still cloudy event. Ferro concludes that Alexandra and her daughters may have survived the revolution, and the woman who later surfaced in Europe claiming to be Anastasia may well have been so.      This authoritative biography by one of the world's great historians shines a bright light on an ordinary man raised to an extraordinary station, who carried an unwanted burden, which crushed him.",

The reason for her deceit is twofold: to step outside of her life and observe it from a distance and to watch the comings and goings in her neighborhood for clues to potential suspects in her husband's shooting.Ever since the night her husband Ren was wounded by an intruder's gun, Francesca has felt uneasy in their marriage and resentful of how Ren has changed over the years. Now, as an undercover spy on her own life, she scans her history in her unsparing, sometimes darkly funny search for clarity - from the idealistic days of college when she first fell in love, through the quiet disappointments that have collected in the depths of her soul, to her recent, unexpected, passionate affair with her Russian gardener, Yuri, whose sudden, unexplainable disappearance leads her to question just who she has become. As she seeks an answer, she meets people she could never have known in her \"real\" life and views people she thought she knew as strangers. As she reveals who shot her husband, she is forced to see herself in a bold, new, and entirely unexpected light . . .",

        "Title": "By the Light of My Father's Smile: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)",
        "Authors": "By Walker, Alice",
        "Description": "By the Light of My Father's Smile is Alice Walker's first novel in six years--a stunning, original, and important book by \"one of the best American writers of today\" (The Washington Post).A family from the United States goes to the remote Sierras in Mexico--the writer-to-be, Susannah; her sister, Magdalena; her father and mother.\u00a0\u00a0And there, amid an endangered band of mixed-race Blacks and Indians called the Mundo, they begin an encounter that will change them more than they could ever dream.\u00a0\u00a0Moving back and forth in time, and among unforgettable characters and their stories, Walker crosses conventional borders of all kinds as she explores in this magical novel the ways in which a woman's denied sexuality leads to the loss of the much prized and necessary original self; and how she regains that self, even as her family's past of lies and love is transformed. By the Light of My Father's Smile presents, as Alice Walker puts it, \"a celebration of sexuality, its absolute usefulness in the accessing of one's mature spirituality, and the father's role in assuring joy or sorrow in this arena for his female children.\"\u00a0\u00a0It explores the richness and coherence of alternative culture, experience of sexuality as a celebration of life, of trust in Nature and the Spirit, even as it affirms the belief, as Walker says, \"that it is the triumphant heart, not the conquered heart, that forgives.\u00a0\u00a0And that love is both timeless and beyond time.\"",

Over the years, a web of tangled longings, love, inadequacies and unfulfilled dreams unfolds as Mary and   Constantine's marriage fails and Susan, Billy, and Zoe leave to make families of  their own. Zoe raises a child with the help of a transvestite, Billy makes a life  with another man, and Susan raises a son conceived in secret, each extending  the meaning of family and love. With the power of a Greek tragedy, the story  builds to a heartbreaking crescendo, allowing a glimpse into contemporary life  which will echo in one's heart for years to come.",

But her adulthood is marked by complex relationships and romantic missteps -- three unsuitable marriages, dramatic crushes, the complicated love between siblings. As Sara Pritchard deftly guides us through Ruby's story, from the present to the past and back again, a portrait of a remarkably resilient woman emerges. Suffused with humor and melancholy, imagination and insight, Crackpots heralds the debut of a skilled and sensitive storyteller.",

        "Description": "Trompe l'oeil paint effects are among the most stunning and effective decorative treatments for walls, furniture and objects. The daunting idea of creating such breathtaking effects however, can be easy with the wealth of simple techniques and ideas provided here.     Decorative artist Mary MacCarthy explains the necessary stenciling techniques:     tracing and cutting stencils  using templates  mixing paints and making glazes and varnishes  painting with stencils  using different brushstrokes to create shading and perspective  creating the basic shapes of vases, plates and panels.       Through a series of 20 projects, she shows how easy it is to create extraordinary visual effects by using templates and repeating patterns and motifs, rather than trying to paint freehand. Faux finishes are equally simple to create and the            combinations of stonework or woodgrain with stenciled motifs are stunning. Using ragging, dragging, stippling, and more, Mary MacCarthy progresses from simple mural painting to wood marquetry.    There are step-by-step instructions and photographs for a Delft tile backsplash, an Etruscan firescreen, a bamboo-effect sidetable; a marbled fireplace, chinoiserie plates, an alphabet block headboard, a scagliola work inlaid tabletop, Dado panels, and a picket-fence frieze that would be perfect for a hall or sunroom.     Template designs are provided and all the projects are accompanied by illustrative photography, comprehensive step-by-step instructions, hints and style idea sidebars and material lists. Simple Trompe L'Oeil is as easy to use as it is beautiful and inspiring.",

        "Title": "Details at Ten",
        "Authors": "By Garland, Ardella",
        "Description": "With this heart-stopping new thriller, Ardella Garland -- pen name of bestselling novelist Yolanda Joe -- introduces one of the sassiest, smartest, and most compelling characters ever to crack a mystery: television news reporter Georgia Barnett. In a tale as immediate as this evening's news, Details at Ten follows the charismatic Georgia as she struggles with justice, truth, and the ratings while pursuing a terrifying story of a child missing in the midst of gang warfare in Chicago. Little Butter, as the girl is called, has disappeared after witnessing a drive-by shooting on the South Side and identifying the criminals' car on live TV during an interview with Georgia. Haunted by the recognition of her responsibility for the child's fate and heartbroken at seeing her old South Side neighborhood devastated by violence, our whip-smart reporter throws herself into the search for Butter -- dragging news producers, directors, cameramen, and support staff behind her kicking and screaming. For as the take-no-prisoners Georgia quickly discovers, the last thing her ratings-driven TV news czars want to cover is another tragedy in a poor black neighborhood. Georgia uses her power as a television personality in smart, hilarious, and heartfelt ways as this shocking story unfolds with the pace of a runaway train. Our daredevil reporter's pursuit of the truth takes her into dangerous territory, but she's not there alone. This is one woman who won't take no for an answer, but everywhere she turns, there in her way stands a masterpiece of a man, Detective Doug Eckart. He's a tough cop and he's not about to let a TV reporter nose in on the case, but Georgia's drive is relentless and she keeps scooping him at the most sensitive moments. These made-for-each-other enemies agree to a sexually tense truce while gang violence escalates, informers turn up dead, and time to find the little girl seems to be running out. As a simple missing-persons case mushrooms into a citywide effort to nab one of the most powerful gang leaders in Chicago, Georgia, Doug, and the crew of Channel Eight News find themselves struggling to do what's right in a world of violence, racism, and fear. In Details at Ten, Ardella Garland takes her readers into a world of both terror and hope with a powerful tale of innocence, justice, and, finally, love.",

        "Title": "Sniper: Inside the Hunt for the Killers Who Terrorized the Nation",
        "Authors": "By Horwitz, Sari and Ruane, Michael E.",
        "Description": "For more than three weeks, the nation watched in disbelief as Washington, D.C., and its surrounding suburbs were held hostage by anonymous gunmen shooting innocent civilians at random. Sniper is the account of those alleged gunmen, John Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, and the massive manhunt that ended with their capture by a heavily armed SWAT team in an early-morning raid at an interstate highway rest stop.Two Washington Post reporters, Sari Horwitz and Michael E. Ruane, retrace the steps of Muhammad and Malvo from their first meeting on the island of Antigua to Malvo's defiant confession in a Virginia jail. Drawing on exclusive reporting about that confession, internal police documents, and a wide range of law-enforcement sources, Horwitz and Ruane track in remarkable detail the murderous trail Muhammad and Malvo are accused of having followed to the Washington area and reconstruct the eerie way in which the two moved invisibly around the nation's capital in the midst of one of the largest police investigations in U.S. history.Horwitz and Ruane also take you inside the police command center where local and state police, joined by the federal government's most experienced crime fighters, worked desperately to stop the killings, unaware that a fundamental error - investigators were wrongly fixated on a white van - was allowing Muhammad and Malvo to slip through the dragnet. We meet FBI negotiators, veteran detectives, forensics experts, prosecutors, and politicians who faced perhaps the biggest challenge of their careers as they confronted frustrating setbacks, logistical nightmares, and the overwhelming pressure of a high-stakes investigation. In a fast-paced narrative that outdoes even the most acclaimed television cop shows, Sniper recounts the extraordinary police work that enabled investigators to quickly exploit the clues handed to them by Muhammad and Malvo that finally led to their arrest.",

        "Description": "Delivering three distinct and powerful visions of characters who choose to defy convention in the pursuit of happiness, Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House and Other Playsis translated with an introduction by Peter Watts in Penguin Classics. The League of Youth was Ibsen's first venture into realistic social drama and marks a turning-point in his style. By 1879 Ibsen was convinced that women suffer an inevitable violation of their personalities within the context of marriage. InA Doll's House, Ibsen caused a sensation with the his portrayal of Nora Helmer, a woman who, gradually arriving at an understanding of her own misery, struggles to break free from the stifling confines of her marriage. Continuing the theme of tensions within the family in The Lady from the Sea, Ibsen put forward the view that freedom with responsibility might at least be a step in the right direction. Peter Watts's lively modern translation is accompanied by an introduction examining Ibsen's life and times, with individual discussions of each of the three plays. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",
