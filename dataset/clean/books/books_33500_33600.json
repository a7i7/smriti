        "Description": "A brash detective enters the Hollywood fast lane-jammed with the sort of wealth, glamour, and blackmail it is famous for-in this new thriller by the bestselling author of the Stone Barrington series.  Stuart Woods's new novel is a sexy, action-packed thriller in the tradition of his best. As the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote about his last novel, Capital Crimes, \"Woods knows how to deliver a taut, well-told tale . . . The last two paragraphs will make any reader gulp.\" In The Prince of Beverly Hills, set in Hollywood's Golden Age of the 1930s, Woods introduces a new character that possesses the kind of suave confidence, take-charge manner, and clever wit-under-pressure that his fans will recognize and love at first sight.  Rick Barron, a sharp, capable detective on the Beverly Hills force, finds himself demoted after a run-in with his captain, but soon lands a job on the security detail for Centurion Pictures, one of the hottest studios. As the protector of the studio's interests, Barron looks after the cream of the crop of filmdom's stars-Clete Barrow, the British leading man with a penchant for parties; and Glenna Gleason, a peach of a talent on the verge of superstardom. Rick's easy charm has society columnists dubbing him \"the Prince of Beverly Hills,\" the white knight of movie stars, until he uncovers a murder cover-up and a blackmail scam that threatens the studio's business and may originate with the West Coast mob. When two suspicious deaths begin to look like double-murder, and an attempt is made on Glenna Gleason's life, Barron knows he is up against wise guys whose stakes are do-or-die. A dicey war of nerves is on.  Set in the era of high style and silver-screen romance, Woods's thoroughly entertaining new crime novel shows us once again why he is a \"master of the genre\" (Los Angeles Times).",

As the holiday season approaches, the boys and girls continue to play pranks on one another and begin to learn the consequences of their actions. Caroline Malloy and Wally Hatford are partners for their fourth-grade December project and discover that, instead of annoying one another, they need to learn how to work together in order to receive a passing grade. Told in their alternating viewpoints, the story moves quickly, continuing the mischief and humor of the previous novels. Readers will be especially taken with precocious and dramatic Caroline, who will stop at nothing for revenge. While it is not necessary to read the first three books, fans of the series will enjoy references to the characters' past pranks and will delight in the promise of future additions to this ongoing battle between these rivals.",

And as people come in all varieties, shapes, and sizes, so do their choices of personal expressions of love. But more often than not, the giver and the receiver express love in two different ways. This can lead to misunderstanding, quarrels, and even divorce.\u00a0<BR><BR>Quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, and\u00a0physical touch are the five\u00a0basic love languages. Dr. Gary Chapman identifies these and guides couples towards a better understanding of their unique languages of love. Learn to speak and understand your mate's love language, and in no time you will be able to effectively love and truly feel loved in return. Skillful communication is within your grasp!<BR>",

        "Description": "This is the powerful true story of the Marine lieutenant who, having fought for his country in the first Gulf War, went on to professional success in finance, only to be compelled to reenlist in the wake of 9/11. Leaving behind an ex-model wife and two children, he served once again in Iraq -- and was charged by the U.S. military with murder.Ilario Pantano has always been a warrior at heart -- it's the force that drives him, that defines his core being and his life. But on April 15, 2004, just a few moments during the most violent and chaotic month in the Iraq War would change his life forever. On a raid in the Sunni hotbed of the Al Anbar province, Lieutenant Pantano shot and killed two Iraqi insurgents. Months later, while successfully leading Marines during the explosive surge in terrorist activity, including the battles for Fallujah, one of his own men disputed Pantano's self-defense claim in the Al Anbar shootings. Pantano was relieved of his command and charged with premeditated murder, a crime punishable by death.Now for the first time, in his own words, Pantano recounts his gripping and controversial story in Warlord, the memoir of a patriot who prepared to reenlist as the Twin Towers fell on September 11, 2001, ten years after his service as an elite Marine sniper and veteran of Desert Storm. Warlord is the story of an unconventional fighter who combined his professional and military experiences to protect the lives of his men and win both on battlefields and in the courtroom. In the face of a widely publicized military hearing, Pantano's family \"attacked into the ambush,\" launching a Defend-the-Defenders campaign that was met with overwhelming support nationwide. Pantano was cleared of all charges. But most surprising of all, the heart of the patriot has not been embittered as he calls on his fellow Americans to stand strong in the face of our enemies.A harrowing, redemptive, and singular contribution to the literature of war, Ilario Pantano's inspiring story brings an unrivaled human dimension to the conflict in Iraq, to the unyielding idealism that drives its American fighting men and women, and to the unexpected consequences and uncompromised faith that can emerge from the brutal, chaotic, and irreversible nature of combat.

        "Title": "Scorpion Down: Sunk by the Soviets, Buried by the Pentagon: The Untold Story of the USS Scorpion",
        "Authors": "By Offley, Ed",
        "Description": "The loss of the nuclear submarine USS Scorpion (SSN-589) on Memorial Day, May 27, 1968, has been commemorated by an American admiral as \"one of the greatest unsolved sea mysteries of our era.\" To this day, the U.S. Navy officially describes it as an inexplicable accident. After the sub failed to return to port at the Norfolk Naval Station following a routine three-month Mediterranean deployment, a frantic search ensued (the largest U.S. naval operation since the Cuban Missile Crisis). Nine days later the Navy announced that the submarine and ninety-nine crewmen on board were presumed lost.In this work of investigative journalism, Ed Offley reveals that the U.S. Navy knew from the very beginning that the Scorpion had been sunk by the Soviets. Even before the Scorpion failed to show up at port, senior Navy officials had initiated an elaborate cover-up to suppress the real story of the undersea battle. The Navy has concealed the truth from the general public and families of the crewmen for nearly four decades. All ninety-nine American sailors aboard the Scorpion died in combat.Here, Ed Offley tells the true story of the USS Scorpion for the first time. Offley tells the dramatic story of a secret battle that could have brought about World War III, and he conclusively demonstrates that the Navy's official story about the Scorpion incident - from the frantic open-ocean hunt for the wreckage to a Court of Inquiry's final conclusions - is nothing more than a carefully-constructed series of lies.",

In this fourth edition one entry in ten has been revised and one entry in twenty is new. Whereas the third edition increased the coverage of American institutions, this edition breaks new ground by including entries considered important from an Eastern European perspective. It also supplies comparative statistics on major economic variables for selected countries, describes the origins of widely used acronyms, and includes bibliographic references at the end of featured entries. The dictionary answers in a clear and concise way the enduring questions, which economists have considered for two centuries or more, as well as the issues of the moment, such as economic change in Europe, the problems of pollution, or the prospects for greater freedom of trade. With close to 2,800 entries it is comprehensive in its coverage of theory, national and international institutions, schools of thought, and important economists, including recent Nobel Prize winners. The dictionary was compiled initially by an experienced team of economists at Aberdeen University in the United Kingdom, and new authors have been recruited to provide international expertise, reflecting changes in the structure of the international economy. This fourth edition was prepared by John Cairns, Robert Elliott, Ian McAvinchey, and Robert Shaw, all of the Economics Department, University of Aberdeen.",

It will keep you reading well into the night.\u201d\u2013Vince FlynnA New York Times reporter has drawn upon his experience covering the occupation in Iraq to write the most gripping and chillingly plausible thriller of the post-9/11 era. Alex Berenson\u2019s debut novel of suspense, The Faithful Spy, is a sharp, explosive story that takes readers inside the war on terror as fiction has never done before.John Wells is the only American CIA agent ever to penetrate al Qaeda. Since before the attacks in 2001, Wells has been hiding in the mountains of Pakistan, biding his time, building his cover.Now, on the orders of Omar Khadri\u2013the malicious mastermind plotting more al Qaeda strikes on America\u2013Wells is coming home. Neither Khadri nor Jennifer Exley, Wells\u2019s superior at Langley, knows quite what to expect.For Wells has changed during his years in the mountains. He has become a Muslim. He finds the United States decadent and shallow. Yet he hates al Qaeda and the way it uses Islam to justify its murderous assaults on innocents. He is a man alone, and the CIA\u2013still reeling from its failure to predict 9/11 or find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq\u2013does not know whether to trust him. Among his handlers at Langley, only Exley believes in him, and even she sometimes wonders. And so the agency freezes Wells out, preferring to rely on high-tech means for gathering intelligence.But as that strategy fails and Khadri moves closer to unleashing the most devastating terrorist attack in history, Wells and Exley must somehow find a way to stop him, with or without the government\u2019s consent.From secret American military bases where suspects are held and \u201cinterrogated\u201d to basement laboratories where al Qaeda\u2019s scientists grow the deadliest of biological weapons, The Faithful Spy is a riveting and cautionary tale, as affecting in its personal stories as it is sophisticated in its political details. The first spy thriller to grapple squarely with the complexities and terrors of today\u2019s world, this is a uniquely exciting and unnerving novel by an author who truly knows his territory.",

The Perricone Prescription clearly and succinctly explains the rock\u2013solid laboratory research behind Dr. Perricone's revolutionary theories, revealing that inflammation at the cellular level, precipitated by poor nutrition, pollution, sunlight, irritating skin\u2013care treatments, and stress, is the single most powerful cause of the signs of aging.

But it's difficult to pin down his explicit arguments, which are obscured under a mountain of detail--a mixture of established facts, outdated information (such as the assertion that Kazakhstan has nuclear weapons when in fact they were all transferred to Russia by 1995), thinly-sourced assertions, and pure conjecture.   Examined closely, Venter's \"facts\" are questionable; and even if taken at face value, they often fail, logically, to support his broader assertions, such as the existence throughout the Middle East of \"an extermination program\" directed against Jews and Israel that derives the bulk of its inspiration from Iran, which is hell-bent on acquiring nuclear weapons in pursuit of said extermination program.

        "Title": "Writing Dangerously: Mary McCarthy and Her World",
        "Authors": "By Brightman, Carol",
        "Description": "Mary McCarthy has played a remarkable and hugely controversial role in the intellectual life of our times. More than any other American writer, she has made its core ideas and many of its secrets the subject of her fiction and criticism; yet neither the drama of her own life nor the precise nature of her literary achievement has been seriously considered until now. Nor has McCarthy herself, in her memoirs, told the whole story.In this ground-breaking biography, Carol Brightman probes both the public and private reaches of McCarthy's career and re-creates the pivotal scenes in her development as a fiercely independent woman and writer. With its recreation of life among the literati in New York, Wellfleet, Paris, Rome, and Castine, Maine, and lively portraits of fellow intellectuals, most notably Hannah Arendt, along with its renditions of the historic events that absorbed McCarthy's generation - the Moscow trials, McCarthyism and the Cold War, Vietnam - Writing Dangerously is literary biography at its finest. The book also explores how the literary enterprise was practiced by a generation whose aspirations and anxieties still shape the way we think about politics and literature.A brilliant stylist and memoirist, McCarthy produced essays, political commentary, and nine works of fiction, including The Group, the best-selling novel whose intimate details about her Vassar classmates foreshadowed women's fiction today. Her Memories of a Catholic Girlhood has become an American classic.Mary McCarthy was first introduced to New York literary circles in 1937 as a theatre critic for the new Partisan Review and the striking girlfriend of its editor, Philip Rahv. As the years passed, she became an electrifying presence among New York and European intellectuals, renowned for her wit, intelligence, and respect for truth, but also for a merciless candor whose sting is still felt today. A lifelong moral struggle between duty and desire led to innumerable lovers and four husbands, including a tempestuous marriage to Edmund Wilson.Carol Brightman - who, like McCarthy, was raised a Catholic, graduated from Vassar, visited North Vietnam - was granted extensive and candid interviews with her subject. Mary McCarthy's life is a mine of paradox and provocation; Brightman is the first biographer to unravel the strands of this fascinating woman's character and bring her vividly to life.",

        "Authors": "By Goldsmith, Edward (EDT) and Mander, Jerry (EDT)",
        "Description": "A great political debate has emerged over the many unexpected and profound consequences of the rush toward the global economy. The world\u2019s political and corporate leaders are restructuring the planet\u2019s economy and political arrangements in ways that are affecting humans and the environment more than anything since the Industrial Revolution. Global institutions such as GATT, the World Trade Organization, NAFTA, and the World Bank?created with scant public debate or scrutiny?have moved real power away from citizens and nation-states to global bureaucracies, with grave results.The Case Against the Global Economy is the first comprehensive, point-by-point analysis of the global economy, its premises, and its social and environmental implications. Represented here are forty-three leading economic, agricultural, and environmental experts who charge that free trade and economic globalization are producing exactly the opposite results from what has been promised. Contributors include William Greider, Jeremy Rifkin, Ralph Nader, Vandana Shiva, David Korten, Wendell Berry, Kirkpatrick Sale, Herman E. Daly, Richard Barnet, Helena Norberg-Hodge, and more than thirty other analysts of the global economy.",

        "Title": "A More Perfect Constitution: 23 Proposals to Revitalize Our Constitution and Make America a Fairer Country",
        "Authors": "By Sabato, Larry J.",
        "Description": "\"No society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs to the living generation.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson\"A constitution intended to endure for years to come [is] consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.\"\u2014John Marshall\"This book will ask readers to set aside their own political loyalties, to look past the current \u2018values' debates and hot-button issues, to consider this very real possibility: that the failure of the nation to update the Constitution and the structure of government it originally bequeathed to us is at the root of our current political dysfunction.\"\u2014Larry SabatoThe political book of the year, from the acclaimed founder and director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.Larry Sabato has one of the most visionary and fertile political minds in America. Like so many, he is increasingly alarmed at the growing dysfunction and unfairness of our political system. To solve this, to restore the equity for ordinary citizens that is at the core of our democratic society, we must take a radical step\u2014to revise the Constitution, the document that guides our political process, for until some of its outmoded provisions are reformed, we will only have more of the same.The original framers fully expected the Constitution to be regularly revised by succeeding generations to reflect the country's changing needs; yet, apart from the ten amendments in the Bill of Rights, it has only been amended 17 times in 220 years, and most of those amendments had minor ramifications. Today, partisan gridlock dominates Washington; 17 percent of voters elect a majority of senators; the presidency has assumed unprecedented and unintended powers; while politicians spend as much time campaigning for office as they do governing; and average Americans feel more and more disconnected from the political process so that half or more don't vote in many elections\u2014all of which would have horrified Jefferson and Madison.A More Perfect Constitution presents twenty three creative and dynamic proposals to reinvigorate American governance at a time when such change is urgently needed. Combining idealism and pragmatism, and with full respect for the original document, Sabato's thought-provoking ideas range from the length of the president's term in office and the number and terms of Supreme Court justices to the structure of Congress, the vagaries of the antiquated Electoral College, and a compelling call for universal national service\u2014all laced through with the history behind each issue and their potential impact on the lives of ordinary people.Aware that such changes won't happen easily, Sabato urges us nonetheless to engage in the debate and discussion they will surely engender. As we head towards a presidential election year, no book is more relevant or significant than his.",

        "Authors": "By Spencer, Paula and Karp, Harvey",
        "Description": "Toddlers can drive you bonkers\u2026so adorable and fun one minute\u2026so stubborn and demanding the next! Yet, as unbelievable as it sounds, there is a way to turn the daily stream of \u201cnos\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d into \u201cyeses\u201d and hugs\u2026if you know how to speak your toddler\u2019s language. In one of the most useful advances in parenting techniques of the past twenty-five years, Dr. Karp reveals that toddlers, with their immature brains and stormy outbursts, should be thought of not as pint-size people but as pintsize\u2026cavemen. Having noticed that the usual techniques often failed to calm crying toddlers, Dr. Karp discovered that the key to effective communication was to speak to them in their own primitive language. When he did, suddenly he was able to soothe their outbursts almost every time! This amazing success led him to the realization that children between the ages of one and four go through four stages of \u201cevolutionary\u201d growth, each linked to the development of the brain, and each echoing a step in prehistoric humankind\u2019s journey to civilization:\u2022 The \u201cCharming Chimp-Child\u201d (12 to 18 months): Wobbles around on two legs, grabs everything in reach, plays a nonstop game of \u201cmonkey see monkey do.\u201d\u2022 The \u201cKnee-High Neanderthal\u201d (18 to 24 months): Strong-willed, fun-loving, messy, with a vocabulary of about thirty words, the favorites being \u201cno\u201d and \u201cmine.\u201d\u2022 The \u201cClever Caveman\u201d (24 to 36 months): Just beginning to learn how to share, make friends, take turns, and use the potty.\u2022 The \u201cVersatile Villager\u201d (36 to 48 months): Loves to tell stories, sing songs and dance, while trying hard to behave.To speak to these children, Dr. Karp has developed two extraordinarily effective techniques:1) The \u201cfast food\u201d rule\u2014restating what your child has said to make sure you got it right;2) The four-step rule\u2014using gesture, repetition, simplicity, and tone to help your irate Stone-Ager be happy again.Once you\u2019ve mastered \u201ctoddler-ese,\u201d you will be ready to apply behavioral techniques specific to each stage of your child\u2019s development, such as teaching patience and calm, doing time-outs (and time-ins), praise through \u201cgossiping,\u201d and many other strategies. Then all the major challenges of the toddler years\u2014including separation anxiety, sibling rivalry, toilet training, night fears, sleep problems, picky eating, biting and hitting, medicine taking \u2014 can be handled in a way that will make your toddler feel understood. The result: fewer tantrums, less yelling, and, best of all, more happy, loving time for you and your child.",

        "Description": "\u201cThere are places that I have never forgotten. A little cobbled street in a smoky mill town in the North of England has haunted me for the greater part of my life. It was inevitable that I should write about it and the people who lived on both sides of its \u2018Invisible Wall.\u2019 \u201dThe narrow street where Harry Bernstein grew up, in a small English mill town, was seemingly unremarkable. It was identical to countless other streets in countless other working-class neighborhoods of the early 1900s, except for the \u201cinvisible wall\u201d that ran down its center, dividing Jewish families on one side from Christian families on the other. Only a few feet of cobblestones separated Jews from Gentiles, but socially, it they were miles apart.On the eve of World War I, Harry\u2019s family struggles to make ends meet. His father earns little money at the Jewish tailoring shop and brings home even less, preferring to spend his wages drinking and gambling. Harry\u2019s mother, devoted to her children and fiercely resilient, survives on her dreams: new shoes that might secure Harry\u2019s admission to a fancy school; that her daughter might marry the local rabbi; that the entire family might one day be whisked off to the paradise of America.Then Harry\u2019s older sister, Lily, does the unthinkable: She falls in love with Arthur, a Christian boy from across the street. When Harry unwittingly discovers their secret affair, he must choose between the morals he\u2019s been taught all his life, his loyalty to his selfless mother, and what he knows to be true in his own heart.A wonderfully charming memoir written when the author was ninety-three, The Invisible Wall vibrantly brings to life an all-but-forgotten time and place. It is a moving tale of working-class life, and of the boundaries that can be overcome by love.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "Title": "If They Only Listened to Us: What Women Voters Want Politicians to Hear",
        "Authors": "By Henneberger, Melinda",
        "Description": "Soon after the 2004 presidential election, veteran reporter Melinda Henneberger set out across the country to listen to women of all ages and occupations express their strong opinions on the major issues of our time. Over eighteen months she spoke in depth and at length with more than two hundred women in twenty states, from Massachusetts to Arizona and Oregon to Texas. She discovered how unheard women feel, how ignored and disregarded by both major parties and by most politicians.   Listening to women all over the nation -- not only on what are traditionally thought of as \"women's issues\" but on issues of paramount importance to all Americans -- Henneberger shines a light on what women voters are thinking and how that translates into how and for whom they vote.   The issues that these women focused on were Iraq, abortion, the environment, globalization (and job loss), and corruption (and lack of trust) in the government and the entire electoral process. Again and again these women of all ages, social classes, and regions returned to the matter of authenticity. And they came back again and again to their commonly held feeling that neither party takes any genuine interest in their actual lives, that politicians across the board seem, as a young waitress in Sacramento put it, \"to be talking about people who don't exist.\"   A patient, sensitive, experienced, intelligent listener, Henneberger reports how women feel about the nation's politics and politicians. Her findings will surprise you. Knowing the answers these women give will tell you a great deal about how the next presidential and other elections will be decided.",
