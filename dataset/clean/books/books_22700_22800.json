        "Title": "An Unfinished Marriage: A Memoir",
        "Authors": "By Anderson, Joan",
        "Description": "In this moving sequel to her national bestseller A Year by the Sea, Joan Anderson explores the challenges of rebuilding and renewing a marriage with her trademark candor, compassion, and insight.With A Year by the Sea, Joan Anderson struck a chord in many tens of thousands of readers. Her brave decision to take a year for herself away from her marriage, her frank assessment of herself at midlife, and her openness in sharing her fears as well as her triumphs won her admirers and inspired women across the country to reconsider their options. In this new book, Anderson does for marriage what she did for women at midlife. Using the same very personal approach, she shows us her own rocky path to renewing a marriage gone stale, satisfying the demand from readers and reviewers to learn what comes next.When Joan and her husband Robin decided to repair and renew their marriage after her eye-opening year of self-discovery, the outcome was far from certain. He had suddenly decided to retire and move to Cape Cod himself and embark on his own journey of midlife reinvention. After the initial shock of incorporating another person back into Joan\u2019s daily life and her treasured cottage, they begin the process of \"recycling\"\u2013using the original materials of their marriage to create a new partnership. Rereading the letters that she had written from Uganda during the early years of their marriage, she is reminded about the nervousness and joy with which she began their life together. Her sudden incapacitation with a broken ankle reveals an unexpected resourceful and tender side in her husband. A grimly comic and strained dinner party with three other couples reveals to both Joan and Robin some of the emotional pitfalls (and horrors) that can befall married couples. In her year of solitude by the sea, Anderson learned that \"there is no greater calling than to make a new creation out of the old self.\" In An Unfinished Marriage, she charts the new journey that she and her husband have begun together, seasoned by their years of marriage but newly awakened to the possibilities of their future together. A unique, tremendously moving and insightful entry into the literature of marriage, it will provide salutary shocks of recognition and fresh hope for all women and men negotiating their own marital passages.",

Eleanor, meanwhile, is forced to utilize her keenest protocol abilities in preventing the duke and duchess from coming to the United States, for they have been rumored to harbor pro-Nazi sympathies.But even though the First Lady is protected by a staff of undercover intelligence officers, the strange customs that prevail in the Bahamas trap Eleanor in the complicated, subversive schemes fabricated by wartime profiteers. As Eleanor begins to investigate the situation more intensely, her visit makes her privy to startling plots that could turn the Bahamas - as well as all of Latin America - into a Nazi base.In A Royal Murder, the resourceful First Lady faces one of her most challenging mysteries yet as she encounters smuggling, defection, internal disloyalty, murder - and even attempts on her own life.",

        "Title": "Curveball: Spies, Lies, and the Con Man Who Caused a War",
        "Authors": "By Drogin, Bob",
        "Description": "Curveball answers the crucial question of the Iraq war: How and why was America\u2019s intelligence so catastrophically wrong? In this dramatic and explosive book, award-winning Los Angeles Times reporter Bob Drogin delivers a narrative that takes us to Europe, the Middle East, and deep inside the CIA to find the truth\u2013the truth about the lies and self-deception that led us into a military and political nightmare.In 1999, a mysterious Iraqi applies for political asylum in Munich. The young chemical engineer offers compelling testimony of Saddam Hussein\u2019s secret program to build weapons of mass destruction. He claims that the dictator has constructed germ factories on trucks, creating a deadly hell on wheels. His grateful German hosts pass his account to their CIA counterparts but deny the Americans access to their superstar informant. The Americans nevertheless give the defector his unforgettable code name: Curveball.The case lies dormant until after 9/11, when the Bush administration turns its attention to Iraq. Determined to invade, Bush\u2019s people seize on Curveball\u2019s story about mobile germ labs\u2013even though it has begun to unravel. Ignoring a flood of warnings about the informant\u2019s credibility, the CIA allows President Bush to cite Curveball\u2019s unconfirmed claims in a State of the Union speech. Finally, Secretary of State Colin Powell highlights the Iraqi\u2019s \u201ceyewitness\u201d account during his historic address to the U.N. Security Council. Yet the entire case is based on a fraud. America\u2019s vast intelligence apparatus conjured up demons that did not exist. And the proof was clear before the war.Most of the events and conversations presented here have not been reported before. The portrayals\u2013from an obdurate president to a bamboozled secretary of state to a bungling CIA director to case handlers conned by their snitch\u2013are vivid and exciting. Curveball reads like an investigative spy thriller. Fast-paced and engrossing, it is an inside story of intrigue and incompetence at the highest levels of government. At a time when Americans demand answers, this authoritative book provides them with clarity and conviction.Just when you thought the WMD debacle couldn\u2019t get worse, here comes veteran Los Angeles Times national-security correspondent Drogin\u2019s look at just who got the stories going in the first place\u2026Simultaneously sobering and infuriating\u2013essential reading for those who follow the headlines.\u00a0--Kirkus ReviewsIn this engrossing account, Los Angeles Times correspondent Drogin paints an intimate and revealing portrait of the workings and dysfunctions of the intelligence community. --Publishers WeeklyEnter Bob Drogin's new book\u2026 an insightful and compelling account of one crucial component of the war's origins\u2026 Had Drogin merely pieced together Curveball's story, it alone would have made for a thrilling book. But he provides something more: a frightening glimpse at how easily we could make the same mistakes again\u2026The real value of Drogin's book is its meticulous demonstration that bureaucratic imperative often leads to self-delusion.--Washington MonthlyDrogin delivers a startling account of this fateful intelligence snafu.--BooklistBut, again, the intelligence community was disappointing the Bush administration\u2026 Los Angeles Times correspondent Bob Drogin lays out the whole sorry tale in his forthcoming book, \"Curveball: Spies, Lies, and the Con Man Who Caused a War.\" --Newsweek By the time you finish this book you will be shaking your head with wonder, or perhaps you will be shaking with anger, about the misadventures that preceded the misadventures in Iraq. This book is so powerful, it almost refutes its subtitle: The man called Curveball did not cause a war; he became a pretext -- one among many. -- George F. Will There used to be an old rule that *real* journalists lived by: 'All governments are run by liars, and nothing they say should be believed.' We've come a long way from those days, to a media that has been cowed into submission and accepting the 'official story.' Thank God for Bob Drogin and his refusal to believe. It's journalists like him and books like CURVEBALL that give many of us a sliver of hope that we can turn things around. --Michael Moore, Director of \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" and \"Sicko\"Curveball is the factual equivalent of Catch 22. It is impossible to read this book and then look at our world leaders without thinking, \"F*ck. Oh f*ck. Oh my God, oh f*ck.\" --Mark Thomas, comedian and political activist\u2026the biggest fiasco in the history of secret intelligence over 500 years.--Frederick Forsyth, author of The Day Of  The Jackal, The Odessa File and The AfghanBob Drogin struck journalistic gold in this story of a conman who told his intelligence handlers exactly what they wanted to hear. If this twisted tale could be read simply as a thrilling farce it would be pure delight -- but much more importantly, it is a history of our time.--Philip GourevitchBob Drogin is a brilliant reporter. In Curveball, he has produced a riveting and important investigation, full of startling and carefully documented detail, laying bare the anatomy of an intelligence failure and its contribution to a catastrophic war.--Steve Coll, author of GHOST WARS: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001Bob Drogin accomplishes what only the best reporters can; he forces you to wonder how he could possibly know that! If you want to know how the CIA could have possibly been so wrong about Iraq, here is a big part of the answer.--Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk DownA crucial study in the political manipulation of intelligence, understanding how Curveball got us into Iraq will arm us for the next round of lies coming out of Washington.--Robert Baer, author of See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on TerrorismHere we go again: the self-deception, the corruption of intelligence, and the abuse of authority, amid a full cast of the usual suspects in the White House and the Pentagon. It's a crucially important story, and it comes wonderfully alive in Curveball.\u00a0It would be almost fun to read if the message wasn't so important\u2013and so devastating to the integrity of the American processes.--Seymour M. Hersh, author of Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu GhraibCurveball is a true story, marvelously reported, about a descent into the netherworld of deceit and duplicity, where the lies of a single man in an interrogation cell in Germany grew like a malign spore in the dark. When it emerged, on the lips of the President and the Secretary of State, it infected the course of world events.--Jonathan Harr, author of A Civil Action and The Lost Painting.",

The world is a more dangerous place than it was when Lamott's Traveling Mercies was published five years ago. Terrorism and war have become the new normal; environmental devastation looms even closer. And there are personal demands on Lamott's faith as well: turning fifty; her mother's Alzheimer's; her son's adolescence; and the passing of friends and time.   Fortunately for those of us who are anxious and scared about the state of the world, whose parents are also aging and dying, whose children are growing harder to recognize as they become teenagers, Plan B offers hope in the midst of despair. It shares with us Lamott's ability to comfort, and to make us laugh despite the grim realities.   Anne Lamott is one of our most beloved writers, and Plan B is a book more necessary now than ever. It will prove to be further evidence that, as The Christian Science Monitor has written, \"Everybody loves Anne Lamott.\"",

After Scarpetta investigates the murder scene, the killer boldly contacts her through the Internet, inviting her to download photos of the murder victim and signing off with a chilling screen name: deadoc.When Scarpetta determines that the victim was exposed to a rare smallpox-like virus before she died and, later, that she herself may have been infected, she realizes that she is up against a killer with access to an incredibly sophisticated arsenal of deadly force - a killer with a specific animus directed toward her.",

        "Description": "Carolina Academic Press will publish the fifth edition of Richard Wydick\u2019s Plain English for Lawyers in time for use in the fall of 2005. Wydick\u2019s little book has been a favorite of law students, legal writing teachers, lawyers, and judges for over 25 years.Last January, the Legal Writing Institute gave Wydick its Golden Pen Award for having written Plain English for Lawyers. The Legal Writing Institute is a non-profit organization that provides a forum for discussion and scholarship about legal writing, analysis, and research. The Institute has over 1,300 members representing all of the ABA-accredited law schools in the United States. Its membership also includes law teachers from other nations, English teachers, and practicing lawyers.The LWI award states: \u201cPlain English for Lawyers . . . has become a classic. Perhaps no single work has done more to improve the writing of lawyers and law students and to promote the modern trend toward a clear, plain style of legal writing.\u201d In 2003 Wydick retired after 32 years on the law faculty of the University of California, Davis. But he still teaches his favorite course \u2014 a seminar in advanced legal writing for third-year law students. For the past eight summers he has also lectured at the International Legislative Drafting Institute presented in New Orleans by the Public Law Center, a joint venture of Tulane and Loyola law schools. There the audience consists of lawyers and non-lawyers from abroad who earn their living drafting legislation in many different languages. \u201cTeaching at the Institute,\u201d Wydick says, \u201cis a precious opportunity to learn how much we English-users have in common with people who write laws in other languages.\u201d How will the fifth edition of Plain English for Lawyers differ from its predecessors? Wydick promises that it will remain a little book, small enough and palatable enough not to intimidate over-loaded law students. \u201cMost of the text will remain the same,\u201d Wydick says, \u201cbut in the past seven years I\u2019ve learned some new things about writing in English, and I want to share that with the readers.\u201d In addition, the exercises at the end of the chapters will be different (a welcome change for long-time teachers who are tired of the old ones). Finally, the teacher\u2019s manual will include additional exercises that teachers can give to students who want or need extra practice.",

The cops suspected homicide, but they could find neither motive nor suspect. Even the means were mysterious: Lorna's body was so badly decomposed when it was discovered that they couldn't be certain she hadn't died of natural causes. In the way of overworked cops everywhere, the case was gradually shifted to the back burner and became another unsolved file.Only Lorna's mother kept it alive, consumed by the certainty that somebody out there had gotten away with murder.In the ten months since her daughter's death, Janice Kepler had joined a support group, trying to come to terms with her loss and her anger. It wasn't helping. And so, leaving a session one evening and noticing a light on in the offices of Millhone Investigations, she knocked on the door.In answering that knock, Kinsey Millhone is pulled into the netherworld of unavenged murder, where only a pact with the devil will satisfy the restless ghosts of the victims and give release to the living they have left behind.Eleven books into the series that has won her readers around the world, Sue Grafton takes a darkside turn, pitching us into a shadow land of pain and grief where killers still walk free, unaccused, unpunished, unrepentant. With \"K\" is for Killer she offers a tale that is dark, complex, and deeply disturbing.\"A\" Is for Alibi\"B\" Is for Burglar\"C\" Is for Corpse\"D\" Is for Deadbeat\"E\" Is for Evidence\"F\" Is for Fugitive\"G\" Is for Gumshoe\"H\" Is for Homicide\"I\" Is for Innocent\"J\" Is for Judgment\"K\" Is for Killer\"L\" is for Lawless\"M\" Is for Malice\"N\" Is for Noose\"O\" Is for Outlaw\"P\" Is for Peril \"Q\" Is for Quarry\"R\" Is for Ricochet \"S\" Is for Silence \"T\" Is for Trespass\"U\" Is for Undertow \"V\" Is for Vengeance \"W\" Is for Wasted \"X\"",

A blind violinist taking a smoke break, a cosmetics sales rep cooking an omelet in her own kitchen, a college professor trudging home from class, a priest contemplating retirement in the rectory garden, an old woman out walking her dog--these are the seemingly random targets shot twice in the face. But most serial killers don't use guns. Most serial killers don't strike five times in two weeks. And most serial killers' prey share something more than being over fifty years of age. Now it falls to Detective Steve Carella and his colleagues in the 87th Precinct to find out what-or whom-the victims had in common before another body is found. With trademark wit and sizzling dialogue, McBain unravels a mystery and examines the dreams we chase in the darkening hours before the fiddlers have fled.",

        "Description": "If modern art is the twentieth century's biography, then this autobiography of one of its pivotal figures is a unique record of our times. Larry Rivers' dazzlingly intelligent testimony takes us through the more than four decades of New York's postwar cultural explosion, telling what it was like for the artists and jazz musicians and poets and playwrights. And his honest exploration of the place of the erotic in his life and work - with all the accompanying excesses, costs, and entanglements - gives his stunning account of the journey a particular power.His talent and imagination enabled Rivers early on to discover and pursue multiple vocations, and to create a liberated self while maintaining an attachment, in his seemingly anarchic work, to the claims of tradition. Rivers started in his Bronx adolescence with a name change and a career (still in progress) as a jazz saxophonist and composer. Painting and sculpture came later, and soon there were one-man exhibitions and a stream of works, many of them now in the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney, the Corcoran, the National Gallery, the Guggenheim, museums abroad, and private collections. A great figurative painter, Rivers is also acclaimed as a precursor of pop art; an artist with an unashamed interest in sexuality and the private moment, he is also celebrated for bringing history back into contemporary painting - from his own famous version of Washington Crossing the Delaware to the pictorial story of the Jews in The History of Matzoh and the somber set of large portraits of Primo Levi.Aside from his major work as a painter, Rivers has written poetry, acted in plays and films, designed sets, illustrated books, and collaborated with writer friends. Along the way there have been marriages and children, affairs and addictions, comic and farcical happenings, sadness and tragedy - all unfolded in a full, richly creative narrative. Candid, thoughtful, and funny, this amazing book is surely destined to take its place among the finest of artists' memoirs.",

And besides that, all he wants is -- Are you ready for this? -- for me to be his person. Just be his person, for heaven's sake! All I can say to that is, Duh! Who knows? Next I may be writing a six-volume Bible commentary!\" Sue offers a merry and witty look at life from the \"shallow\" end of the gene pool in sixty fun devotions, sure to leave you laughing and pondering some of life's most important lessons.

        "Description": "The amazing story of the thirteen-year-old surfer girl who lost her arm in a shark attack but never lost her faith -- and of her triumphant return to competitive surfing.They say Bethany Hamilton has saltwater in her veins. How else could one explain the tremendous passion that drives her to surf?  How else could one explain that nothing -- not even the loss of her arm in a horrific shark attack -- could come between her and the waves?That Halloween morning in Kauai, Hawaii -- a glorious part of the world, where it's hard to deny the divine -- Bethany responded to the shark's stealth attack with the calm of a girl with God on her side. Pushing pain and panic aside, she immediately began to paddle with one arm, focusing on a single thought: \"Get to the beach....\" Rushed to the hospital, where her father, Tom Hamilton, was about to undergo knee surgery, Bethany found herself taking his spot in the O.R. It's the kind of coincidence that isn't mere coincidence to the Hamilton family, a clan whose motto could easily be \"the family that surfs and prays together stays together.\" To them it was a sign someone had a greater plan than the one they'd been working on themselves -- which had been to scrape together whatever resources they could to help Bethany rise to the top of her sport. When the first thing Bethany wanted to know after surgery was \"When can I surf again?\" it became clear that her unfaltering spirit and determination were part of a greater story -- a tale of courage and faith that this modest and soft-spoken girl would come to share with the world.  Soul Surfer is a moving account of Bethany's life as a young surfer, her recovery in the wake of the shark attack, the adjustments she's made to her unique surfing style, her unprecedented bid for a top showing in the World Surfing Championships, and, most fundamentally, her belief in God. It is a story of girl power and spiritual grit that shows that the body is no more essential to surfing -- perhaps even less so -- than the soul.",

But one bad apple did fall from the Caine family tree. When he cracked under fire in Vietnam, Sandy's father, Alex, dishonored the long gray line and sentenced his only child to a lifetime of brooding. Now, pulling tours of duty in one global hot spot after another, it occurs to Sandy that he knows a dozen ways to kill a man for every way he knows of being one.Little does he know that the truth of what happened to his father in Vietnam's Central Highlands has transformed into a thirty-year legacy of deception perpetrated by Washington's most powerful players. And the only person with the skills to help Sandy untangle the Caine family secrets is Abigail Mancini, an ambitious civilian reporter with the Washington Chronicle. Sandy and Abbie know that combining Special Forces and the Fourth Estate is a recipe for disaster, but living dangerously is its own reward. In times of war, the first casualty is the truth. It's not long before Sandy and Abbie learn that digging it up decade later can get you killed.",

The moment they arrive, however, things swiftly begin to go wrong. Holly and several other guests receive chillingly anonymous cards offering condolences on the deaths of their pets. Equipment is sabotaged. Advertisements for canine coffins and articles about deadly diseases and potentially fatal hazards in the home appear in handbags and scattered about the meeting rooms.Suspicion naturally falls on one particularly cranky and unpleasant guest, whom everyone would love to blame. But then mischief turns to murder, and someone is trying very hard to put Holly off the scent.The highly competitive world of purebred dogdom arouses strong passions, and none more powerful than the fear of banishment or loss of face. But how far might a breeder of Labrador retrievers go to save her reputation? Would an American Kennel Club judge risk \"conduct unbecoming\" - or worse?Holly almost loses her life while trying to find the answers. And, not surprisingly, the dogs in this engagingly suspenseful tale often prove to be more well-bred than their human companions.Infused with intriguing bits of gossip and information about the insiders' world of dogs, Black Ribbon proves that Holly Winter - and Susan Conant - are once again in championship form!",

        "Description": "The Haunted Land is a look at how four newly democratic eastern European nations are dealing with the memories of forty years of communism. As one official orthodoxy replaces another, the people and governments of Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia face ethical dilemmas as complex and wrenching as anything out of Kafka or Orwell.In the greatest moral drama of our time, Communist totalitarianism drew well-intentioned, even idealistic people into horrible crimes. Now, as formerly Communist nations attempt to atone for the past, there is the everpresent temptation to rewrite history to suit the demands of the present. Tina Rosenberg s journalistic triumph is to put a human face on the abstractions of intrigue and betrayal, memory and ideology. The stories in this book take place not just in the highest councils of government and courts of law, but also in smoky pubs and the most private chambers of the soul. The Haunted Land shows how people struggle with their own definitions of guilt as they learn their betrayers were their husbands, fathers, and best friends.",

        "Title": "President Kennedy: Profile of Power",
        "Authors": "By Reeves, Richard",
        "Description": "Three decades after his death, here is the startling story of John F. Kennedy's three years in the White House. Based on previously unavailable White House files, letters and records, and hundreds of new interviews, Richard Reeves has written the first objective account of Kennedy's presidency. President Kennedy is a dramatic day-by-day, often minute-by-minute, Oval Office narrative of what it was, and is, like to be President. This is the view from the center of power during the years when the United States faced nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union and something close to racial war at home. This is brilliant, relevant history, vividly told.Kennedy lived along a line where charm became power. He proved that the only qualification for the most powerful job in the world was wanting it. He would not wait his turn, sure that he could always prevail one-on-one - until, in pain and heavily medicated, he was humiliated in Vienna in 1961 at a summit with Nikita Khrushchev. He came home in despair, thinking he would be the last U.S. President, asking for the number of expected American deaths in the war that seemed inevitable - 70 million, he was told.He began a massive military build-up and a secret search for peace. On the day in 1963 when that peace seemed possible, he gave the greatest speech of his life on ending the Cold War - on the same day that four black girls were blown to bits at a church in Birmingham and a Buddhist monk burned himself to death in Saigon to protest a government created by the United States. Within weeks, Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed on a nuclear test ban treaty, hundreds of thousands of blacks led by Martin Luther King, Jr., marched on Washington, and Kennedy ordered the overthrow of the U.S.-backed government in South Vietnam - beginning a cycle of assassinations that ended with his own death and those of King and his brother Robert Kennedy.These were the days when the world held its breath. The Bay of Pigs. The Freedom Rides. The Vienna Summit. The building of the Berlin Wall. Kennedy's confrontation with U.S. Steel. The deadly riots and demonstrations as blacks tried to enroll in the state universities of Mississippi and Alabama. The Cuban missile crisis. The tax cut. The sending of U.S. troops into Vietnam. His relations with Eisenhower, Premier Khrushchev, Charles de Gaulle, Harold Macmillan, Fidel Castro, Ngo Dinh Diem, Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Edgar Hoover, Marilyn Monroe and a hundred other women, and his own men, particularly Robert Kennedy and Robert McNamara.John Kennedy lived life as a race against boredom and death, thinking he would die young, needing large doses of drugs with side effects that included depression, paranoia, and compulsive sexual desire. Kennedy brought out the best in the American people and recast the U.S. economy, presiding over the century's greatest prosperity.On the morning after the new President's first night in the White House, his old friend journalist Charles Bartlett asked him if he had slept in Abraham Lincoln's bed and Kennedy answered that he had: \"I jumped in and just hung on!\" He was still hanging on three years later.",

        "Description": "\"The Dive from Clausen's Pier is one of those small miracles that reinforce our faith in fiction. It does what the best novels so often do, making the largest things visible by its perfect rendering of life on the smaller scale. It is witty, tragic and touching, and beguiling from the first page.\" --Scott Turow A riveting novel about loyalty and self-knowledge, and the conflict between who we want to be to others and who we must be for ourselves. Carrie Bell has lived in Wisconsin all her life. She\u2019s had the same best friend, the same good relationship with her mother, the same boyfriend, Mike, now her fianc\u00e9, for as long as anyone can remember. It\u2019s with real surprise she finds that, at age twenty-three, her life has begun to feel suffocating. She longs for a change, an upheaval, for a chance to begin again.That chance is granted to her, terribly, when Mike is injured in an accident. Now Carrie has to question everything she thought she knew about herself and the meaning of home. She must ask: How much do we owe the people we love? Is it a sign of strength or of weakness to walk away from someone in need?The Dive from Clausen\u2019s Pier reminds us how precarious our lives are and how quickly they can be divided into before and after, whether by random accident or by the force of our own desires. It begins with a disaster that could happen, out of the blue, in anybody\u2019s life, and it forces us to ask how we would bear up in the face of tragedy and what we know, or think we know, about our deepest allegiances. Elegantly written and ferociously paced, emotionally nuanced and morally complex, The Dive from Clausen\u2019s Pier marks the emergence of a prodigiously gifted new novelist.",

        "Title": "Grown-up Marriage: What We Know, Wish We Had Known, and Still Need to Know About Being Married",
        "Authors": "By Viorst, Judith",
        "Description": "In a grown-up marriage the laughter exceeds the regret. In a grown-up marriage we've learned to forgive and forget. Well, maybe not forget. In a grown-up marriage we do not keep score -- at least, not out loud.  Although marriage is for grown-ups, very few of us are grown up when we marry. What is a grown-up marriage? Can we achieve one? Here, from the bestselling author of Suddenly Sixty and Necessary Losses comes her best ever -- a life-affirming book on the difficulties and possibilities of being well and enduringly wed.  For years, hundreds of thousands of readers have enjoyed Judith Viorst's poetry and prose on the challenging, sometimes hilarious subject of marriage. Now, in this thought-provoking new book, she helps married couples of every age and stage figure out how they might create a grown-up marriage.  Blending interviews of married women and men with the findings of couples therapists, the truths offered by literature and the movies, and a bemused exploration of her own marriage, Viorst illuminates the issues couples struggle with from \"I do\" to \"till death do us part.\" She examines marital rivalry, marital manners, marital sex (not always with the person to whom we're married), fighting and apologies, and the boredom and the bliss of ordinary everyday married life. All aspects of marriage -- from the early years when we wonder \"Who is this person?\" and \"What am I doing here?\" to divorcing or almost divorcing, marrying again, growing older and old together -- are explored with honesty, humanity, and humor, with a rueful recognition of how tough it is to be married and -- if we can make it -- how precious it is.  Viorst's insights into what it takes to stay married -- a commitment to preserve and defend our marriage against all attacks, including our own; the recognition that courtesy and charm, like charity, begin at home; the honoring of each other's good intentions and good will, even when we don't get what we need; the adaptations and compromises; the just plain dumb luck and the hard, hard work -- have something to offer everyone, even the most abidingly married among us. Fascinating, funny, and perceptive, Viorst's Grown-up Marriage will enrich the lives of all her readers.",
