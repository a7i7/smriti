        "Description": "Like no other sport, golf obsesses those poor souls who hope to master its subtleties and abundant complexities. One shot is hit like a dream, the next a nightmare. As a result, the game's disciples have embraced any and all techniques endorsed by pros and hackers, poets and philosophers (these days a good walk is often spoiled by tripping over a sandtrap's worth of Zen meditations and mystical tomes). But while so many have journeyed through golf's metaphysics, no one has presented a readable, compelling look at the science of the game -- until now.In Newton on the Tee, accomplished science writer John Zumerchik examines, explores, and explains to us the endless details that make golf such a tantalizing pursuit. Written in language accessible to even the most scientifically disinclined, Zumerchik's book delves into areas of supreme importance to every golfer, including:The Physics of the Sweet Swing: The universal principles shared by all those rhythmic and well-timed swings you see on TV but not in the mirrorMind Over Muscle: How the brain affects and controls the movements of the body (and why confidence is the golfer's most indispensable tool)Getting the Ball from Here to There: Decoding the vagaries of launch angles, spin, lift, and gravity that make the difference between walking happily down the fairway and tramping into the bunkersProbability and Statistics: Understanding the mathematics of golf, and a by-the-numbers appraisal of golf's greatest legendsWith a firm grasp of both his subject and his 7-iron, Zumerchik takes the reader through all these topics and more, in an entertaining and enlightening work that will give every golfer something to chew on besides his or her nails, and make clear and comprehensible the hundred-and-thirty-five things you shouldn't think about during your backswing.",

First, she shows the \"flabbiness\" of much recent talk of spiritual formation in the church.\u00a0 She demonstrates the importance of learning about and achieving Christian formation instead.\u00a0 Second, she shows how the present theories of stages in faith development must be replaced by a perceptive understanding of the way persons actually learn and believe.\u00a0 Third, she replaces the popular focus on individual psychology with one that emphasizes the corporate nature of the church and the grace of God.This volume brings innovative ideas into the practical arena, where they can be applied by Christian educators in local churches.\u00a0 Christian Spiritual Formation in the Church and Classroom challenges the way the entire discipline is currently approached.",

        "Description": "In The Impossible Will Take a Little While, a phrase borrowed from Billie Holliday, the editor of Soul of a Citizen brings together fifty stories and essays that range across nations, eras, wars, and political movements. Danusha Goska, an Indiana activist with a paralyzing physical disability, writes about overcoming political immobilization, drawing on her history with the Peace Corps and Mother Teresa. Vaclav Havel, the former president of the Czech Republic, finds value in seemingly doomed or futile actions taken by oppressed peoples. Rosemarie Freeney Harding recalls the music that sustained the civil rights movement, and Paxus Calta-Star recounts the powerful vignette of an 18-year-old who launched the overthrow of Bulgaria's dictatorship. Many of the essays are new, others classic works that continue to inspire. Together, these writers explore a path of heartfelt community involvement that leads beyond despair to compassion and hope. The voices collected in The Impossible Will Take a Little While will help keep us all working for a better world despite the obstacles.",

From his teachings came a system of ethics for managing society that has influenced generations of politicians, social reformers, and religious thinkers. Indeed, the effect of Confucian philosophy has been so profound that it has become basic not only to an understanding of traditional Chinese civilization, but of Western society as well. Now the essence of Confucian teaching, contained in The Analects, is available in this inexpensive volume, providing inspirational and instructive reading to anyone interested in the history of social thought, Chinese philosophy, or theories of ethical behavior.",

        "Authors": "By Garrison, Webb B.",
        "Description": "True stories of unusual happenings during the civil war. In 1861, Wilmer McLean, distressed that a cannon ball crashed through his home during the battle of Bull Run, moved to a farm where \"the sound of battle would never again reach him and his family.\" Almost four years later, McLean's Appomattox Court House home was used for Lee's surrender to Grant. There wasn't damage from cannon balls, but souvenir-hunting Union officers left McLean's parlor bare of furniture.After the Confederacy was defeated, Jefferson Davis was stripped of his citizenship. He died as a man without a country. His citizenship was restored by Congress during the administration of Georgian Jimmy Carter.Three members of the Guillet family were killed while riding the same horse, which was then given to the Ohio Ninety-eighth regiment. Three officers were killed while riding the same horse. Lieutenant Milliner, the senior officer left on the field, then jumped on the jinxed horse. He escaped death, but suffered all his life from an arm shatterred by a minie ball while he was in the saddle.Civil War Curiosities uncovers those unusual persons, attitudes, and events that take you beyond a textbook understanding of the Civil War. A collection of\u00a0 fascinating anecdotes and colorful stories, this book covers a wide variety of subjects, including \"newfangled\" weapons that changed the nature of war, the press' outrageous inaccuracy in covering the conflict, the phenomenon of \"silent battles, \" and various disguises, atrocities, and mix-ups.",

His answer is clear: It is believing passionately in what you do, never compromising your standards and values, and caring about your clients, your people and your own career.

On campus he finds the challenges to his faith -- both intellectual and personal -- almost more than he can bear. Then he meets Bill Seipel and Bob Wong. Together, the three young men, two of them Christians and the other a self-styled atheist, forge a common bond in the quest for truth. In the process they confront some of the dominant ideologies of the secular university.Weaving the story of Chris's first year on campus with separate expository chapters on such forces as individualism, pluralism, relativism and privitization, James Sire offers a helpful apologetic for those who are searching for truth in a postmodern world. He identifies no fewer than six types of relativism, from \"All religions boil down to the same thing\" and \"It's true for you; it's not true for me\" to \"God does not exist; naturalism is true.\"  Then in down-to-earth language Sire helps readers to think through these and other complex issues.",

        "Title": "Roaring Lambs: A Gentle Plan to Radically Change Your World",
        "Authors": "By Briner, Bob",
        "Description": "Where have all the Christians gone?Bob Briner believes evangelical Christian thought, ideas, and ideals are not shaping American society. In fact, he feels solid Christian thinking seldom is part of the important discussions and debates of our culture. There's very little \"salt\" in the popular press, almost none on television, only a grain or two in modern literature and the visual arts, and barely a dash in movies. In the culture-shaping arenas of our society - those areas that influence how we think and act - Christians have abdicated their role as salt and light.Is this just the way it's supposed to be? Should Christians be content with a society that glorifies the profane and welcomes the immoral? \"No way,\" says Briner. His book is a call for Christians to become \"roaring lambs\" - men and women who believe the Christian faith is relevant to all the problems faced by modern man and who still act on that conviction.Briner believes it's wrong to criticize Hollywood, the press, television, the arts, and the publishing business for the immoral and irreverent views they espouse. Without Christians working shoulder to shoulder with these \"culture shapers,\" how can we expect them to accept and promote Judeo-Christian values? Instead of protests and boycotts, the way to clean up these industries is to join them. Christian writers need to write decent novels to replace the trashy ones. Christian filmmakers and supporting investors need to make wholesome, honorable movies to compete against the filth that comes out of Hollywood. And for those who may never be in a position to \"roar\" at this level, we can all encourage our children to pursue careers that will enable them to help shape culture.This book is more than a critique of Christian influence in the world. It is a strategy for re-entering the world for God and His Kingdom. Using personal anecdotes from his own experience as an Emmy-award-winning roaring lamb, the author will offer ways for Christians to jump back into the fray. He will show that you don't have to be the CEO of Warner Bros. to be a roaring lamb; you just need to begin believing that Christian faith and teaching belong in every arena of public discourse.Read the book, then clear your throat. It's time for the lambs to roar!",

We extend the warranties on our appliances. But by insulating ourselves from the unknown\u2014the risks of life\u2014we miss the great adventure of living our lives to their full potential.Ben Carson spent his childhood as an at-risk child on the streets of Detroit, and today he takes daily risks in performing complex surgeries on the brain and the spinal cord. Now, offering inspiring personal examples, Dr. Carson invites us to embrace risk in our own lives. From a man whose life dramatically portrays the connection between great risks and greater successes, here are insights that will help you dispel your fear of risk so you can dream big, aim high, move with confidence, and reap rewards you\u2019ve never imagined.By avoiding risk, are you also avoiding the full potential of your life?The surgery was as risky as anything Dr. Ben Carson had seen. The Bijani sisters\u2014conjoined twins\u2014shared part of a skull, brain tissue, and crucial blood flow. One or both of them could die during the operation. But the women wanted separate lives. And they were willing to accept the risk to reach the goal, even against the advice of their doctors \u2026As a child on the dangerous streets of Detroit, and as a surgeon in operating theaters around the world, Dr. Ben Carson has learned all about risk\u2014he faces it on a daily basis. Out of his perilous childhood, a world-class surgeon emerged precisely because of the risks Dr. Carson was willing to take. In his compelling new book, he examines our safety-at-all-costs culture and the meaning of risk and security in our lives.In our 21st-century world, we insulate ourselves with safety. We insure everything from vacations to cell phones. We go on low-cholesterol diets and buy low-risk mutual funds. But in the end, everyone faces risk, like the Bijani twins did with their brave decision. Even if our choices are not so dramatic or the outcome so heartbreaking, what does it mean if we back away instead of move forward? Have we so muffled our hearts and minds that we fail to reach for all that life can offer us\u2014and all that we can offer life?Take the Risk guides the reader through an examination of risk, including:\u2022 A short review of risk-taking in history.\u2022 An assessment of the real costs and rewards of risk.\u2022 Learning how to assess and accept risks.\u2022 Understanding how risk reveals the purpose of your lives.",
