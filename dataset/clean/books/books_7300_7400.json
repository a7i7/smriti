        "Description": "Close your eyes. Imagine that you are a European on a voyage of discovery during the time before Columbus. Your ship is destroyed by a violent storm. You are the lone survivor. Miraculously, the piece of ship's debris washes ashore onto an uninhabited tropical island.The lush island is full of fruits, nuts, and berries; an abundance of wildlife; and plenty of fresh water. There are caves to protect you from storms and animals. Physical survival poses no problem.There is only one hitch. Not only are you the island's only inhabitant, but no one knows you are there. You are presumed to have been lost at sea. There is no reason whatsoever to assume that another ship will ever pass your way before you die, since Europeans have not yet discovered America and such voyages are rare. You will never see another human being for the rest of your life.What would you do? How would you survive emotionally? What would make your life worthwhile? Is meaning possible without any human connectedness?Welcome to The Search for Meaning, a seven-step process that involves coming to grips with what it means to be a human being who lives, loves, works, plays, suffers, and dies. Will Willimon, Thomas Naylor, and Magdalena Naylor guide us as we review our life histories; come to terms with meaninglessness in our lives; confront separation from ourselves and others; contemplate the consequences of merely having; seek meaning through being; formulate a personal philosophy; and devise a personal strategy to address the most important quest human beings face - the need for our lives to have enduring meaning.",

In There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road But Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos, Hightower shows not only what's wrong, but also how to fix it, offering specific solutions and calling for a new political movement of working families and the poor to \"take America back from the bankers and bosses, the big shots and bastards.\" \"If you don't read another book about what's wrong with this country for the rest of your life, read this one.

Two children drown during the summer of 1958 in the English village of Cameldip. Their parents, Isabel and Robert, are bound together in guilt and anger, and as the years pass, the tragedy weaves itself into the invisible fabric of village life.Robert, finding solace in labor, builds several tree houses that transform the look of the town, and as the years pass the structures grow entwined with other houses. It is thirty years after the tragedy when Anna, a young pregnant woman escaping her life in London, arrives in Cameldip and is taken in by Isabel. As Anna slowly uncovers the secrets of the town's past, she becomes inexorably drawn into the conflict in which Isabel and Robert have been locked for three decades. A story of families, old scars, and new beginnings, The River is a lyrical and haunting tale of betrayal, failure, love, and fortitude.",

        "Authors": "By O'Hanlon, Michael E.",
        "Description": "Two important events in 1997--the balanced-budget deal and the completion of the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)--promise to shape U.S. military policy for the next several years. Unfortunately, they are at odds with each other.   The balanced budget accord will result in a real level of defense spending that is 8 percent lower in 2002 than in 1998. But the proportionate cuts in personnel and weaponry that the QDR calls for are only about half that size. Moreover, the U.S. military is near the end of its so-called  \"procurement holiday\" and will soon have to buy more equipment.     In this study, Michael O'Hanlon suggests a way out of this budgetary fix. In contrast to the current U.S. military posture, built around a requirement to fight two Desert-Storm like wars at once, he offers an alternative force structure organized around the concept of a \"Desert Storm plus Desert Shield plus Bosnia/IFOR\" requirement. O'Hanlon also suggests that naval operations be conducted more efficiently by leaving ships on forward station for longer periods of time and rotating crews by airlift. Finally, he argues for a number of selected economies in weapons modernization programs, together with some increases in areas like strategic airlift, sealift, and transport helicopters. The resulting force would save over $10 billion a year.",

Hutchins comes back home for a family crisis but ultimately returns to England, where he achieves a maturity that enables him to cope with commitments, abandonments, and the creation of an honest personal agenda.  In The Source of Light, Reynolds Price combines gravity and buoyancy, a mythic sense of the past with the mysteries of place, to forge an encompassing portrait of the strange and various world one travels through in the quest for self-fulfillment.",

My dead buddy....  Then I saw the money on the bed, I saw the cheap metal bedpost, the bare lightbulb. My one-room apartment....That was the first time I took too much money, money that didn't belong to me. Thanks, Rudy.  Then, still in his police uniform, Rudy Solano was a judge, pointing at me, lecturing me: How could you do this? I was a prisoner in the dock, I was on trial....  Solano's face began to sweat and shake, as I had seen it do in life. He fell from the judge's bench, landing in the snow, in hunting clothes covered with blood, as I had found him when Sergeant Gatto drove me up to Jaffrey that Saturday night. I was there, in the snow, in my dream. The yellow tape from the police barrier stuck to my clothes. It was still there the next day when I walked into my office in the Hart Senate Office Building. Everyone was staring at it. How am I going to explain this snow, this tape?  Fresh from the scary world of international organized crime in Weld's bestselling and hilarious Mackerel by Moonlight, ex-prosecutor and newly elected senator Terry Mullally, one of the most charming, handsome, and fickle rogues to hit the fiction pages in recent memory, finds that his old enemies may still have murder on their minds and that new ones are laying traps for him.  In his first novel, which Kirkus described as \"Primary Colors meets George V. Higgins,\" and People magazine called \"a blisteringly funny suspense tale,\" we followed Mullally's rise from assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn to district attorney in Massachusetts to the U.S. Senate. Now he has married and is madly in love with the gorgeous widow of a shady murdered businessman, trying to shed the mobsters and cops who know his secrets and find his way through a new minefield. With good reason, Mullally sees danger everywhere. Does his wife know what he has done to get where he is? Does the new head of the criminal division of the Justice Department? Will the whole world?  Mullally is quickly drawn into the schemes of loose money and political vendettas. Two of his fellow Democratic senators are vying for his support in the primaries of 2000, but Mullally admires the maverick Republican vice president, Martha Holloway, who also wants to be president. He has a lot of balls to keep in the air.  Fast-paced, funny, sexy, Big Ugly follows the insouciant Mullally as he pulls off another surprise ending to save his precious skin.",

While in Chicago for his first northern campaign against poverty and inequality, King encounters Chaym Smith, whose startling physical resemblance to King wins him the job of official stand-in. Matthew Bishop, a civil rights worker and loyal follower of King, is given the task of training the smart and deeply cynical Smith for the job. In doing so, Bishop must face the issue of what makes one man great while another man can only stand in for greatness.

Nothing can stand in her way -- nothing, that is, but her freshman-fifteen pounds, a senile talent agent, and the fact that she's living back home with her parents in Brooklyn.  While waiting for the ever-elusive big break, Ariel discovers a hidden talent for channeling her erotic fantasies and becomes a sex columnist at New York's hottest downtown weekly. Soon, art and life are imitating one another, and the junkies, commitmentphobes, and other subjects of Ariel's columns are wreaking havoc on her life. But when she finally falls in love, the real Ariel must stand up. Is she a nice Jewish girl who wants to settle down or a brazen sex kitten who'd rather meet a deadline than the man of her dreams?  Sharp, savvy, and irresistible, Run Catch Kiss is a tongue-in-cheek commentary on that dangerous turn-of-the-century phenomenon: the single girl who wants it all.",

Olmstead lays bare the acute pain of his father's alcoholism and the shattering decline of his grandfather, the family patriarch. With delicate sensuality, he traces the flowering of his love for a woman who \"walks like light would walk if it could.\" And throughout, there is the land where his family has worked and lived and died for six generations, land at once richly abundant and cruelly demanding.",

        "Title": "Leading Self-Directed Work Teams: A Guide to Developing New Team Leadership Skills (McGraw-Hill Training Series)",
        "Authors": "By Fisher, Kimball",
        "Description": "Across the country, highly competitive, self-directed work teams (SDWTs) are chalking up astonishing productivity gains. These work teams are replacing entrenched, autocratic, boss-driven organizations whose management styles are obsolete. Driving these remarkable workplace success stories is a new breed of supervisor who empowers teams through example and commitment, instead of by demanding obedience and control.Drawing upon the actual experiences of hundreds of team leaders in such self-directed workplaces as Kodak, Apple, Corning, Shell, and many others, Leading Self-Directed Work Teams reveals how supervisors in any company - large or small - an take advantage of the career-boosting leadership skills that make and keep major corporations competitive.This timely book takes a refreshingly candid look at the challenges, intricacies, and rewards of changing from a traditional supervisor to a confident SDWT leader. It focuses on hundreds of practical, time-tested techniques for developing the business, interpersonal, and technical capabilities of any team. And it explains step-by-step how you can master such crucial team leadership skills as coaching, business analysis, barrier busting, facilitating groups, customer advocacy, accessing information, and much more. Along the way, the author profiles the most innovative team leader practices learned from Kodak's 13 Room and Procter & Gamble experiments, demonstrating the remarkable benefits of managing by principle rather than by policy, and setting boundaries that change as the team matures.Leading Self-Directed Work Teams guides you confidently through each of the five evolutionary phases most SDWTs experience during their maturation, detailing the specific skills and behaviors required to meet this sequence of challenges. For exceptional utility, it provides a weekly activity guide to help team leaders remember critical activities, supplies a special chapter focusing on \"3 days in the life of a team leader,\" and shows how to quickly test and interpret your thoughts and behaviors about team leadership.Whether you're a supervisor or CEO - whether your team is a small group of office workers or a Fortune 100 company - discover how to excite, energize, and inspire team members by developing the vision and guiding principles for effective team leadership; fostering coordination, clarity, and consistency without restricting autonomy and creativity; giving and obtaining feedback in a constructive, nondefensive manner; ending temper flare-ups, grievances, and eroding trust among team members; dealing with team members, peers, and senior managers resistant to the new work paradigm; deciding when appropriate management intervention is not only acceptable, but required; and making decisions in real time without traditional wasted periods.In today's rapidly changing marketplace, the competitive edge belongs to those organizations that capitalize on the full potential of their human and technical resources. Leading Self-Directed Work Teams gives you the skills, insights, and confidence to adapt to today's indispensable leader-facilitator role and guide newly empowered, participative teams to their full potential.",

        "Description": "The bestselling historical novel that exposes the less than honorable side of our Founding Fathers by the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist. In this gripping and timely work, William Safire unveils the story behind the nation's first great political scandals. James Thomson Callender, the \"scandalmonger\" of the title, is an ambitious gossip-peddling editor secretly hired by Thomas Jefferson as a political weapon. After carefully damaging Alexander Hamilton's reputation, thereby paving the way for Jefferson's success, Callender is shunned by the very politicians on whose behalf he was jailed for sedition. Broke and betrayed, Callender seeks revenge by exposing an illicit affair between Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemmings, an accusation that ultimately cost Callender his career and would not be authenticated for two centuries. By using actual letters, records, and notes to re-create dialogue and events, Scandalmonger embodies historical fiction at its best, politics at its most intriguing, and our Founding Fathers at their most notorious. For those who think that Washington sex scandals and lurid journalism are recent developments, this novel will be a revelation, for Safire shows how media intrusiveness into private lives-and politicians' cool manipulation of the press-are practices as old as the Constitution.",

        "Authors": "By Cambridge",
        "Description": "Over the past several years, the issues of energy demand and energy use have increasingly become the concerns of the research community. A significant number of scientists and technologists, as well as specialists in the economic and social disciplines, have responded to the critical need to resolve these issues, which are only now seriously activating decision makers in government and in the private sector and engaging the attention of consumers. In fact, the study of energy problems is rapidly gaining the status of a formally recognized subject area, supported by a sizable body of published research. This book makes a solid contribution to the foundation of this new subject area.The book is based on a conference held at MIT in February 1973. It includes in their entirety four important invited papers\u2014\"Ways of Looking at Future Economic Growth, Resource and Energy Use,\" by Tjalling C. Koopmans; \"Theory and Practice of Effluent Control,\" by Robert Dorfman; \"Institutional Capacity to Implement Energy Conversion Proposals,\" by Edward Berlin; and \"The Entropy Crisis,\" by George N. Hatsopoulos\u2014and a number of contributed papers that were presented at the conference by authorities from across the country and from abroad.The editor has organized the papers into a number of groups that represent major study areas and topics of general concern: economic growth and energy resources, the modeling of the energy system, input-output methodologies applied to energy studies, studies of electrical demand, energy in transportation, the transportation of energy, energy conservation, energy supply, problems of gas regulation, solar energy, and institutional problems.The conference was organized by MIT's Energy Laboratory under a grant from the RANN program of the National Science Foundation.",

The road of excess led, for him, not to the palace of wisdom but rather to a psychiatric hospital in one of New York's least exalted boroughs.The Back Veil is Rick Moody's account of that debilitating passage in his life. It is the story of a mind unraveling, and of how it feels when the underpinnings of life fall away. The anxieties of early adulthood, of first finding a place in the world - the weight placed upon that first relationship, first job, first apartment - are presented here with enormous sympathy. Anyone who has ever felt his or her own psychological footing slip, even briefly, will find Moody's account of his breakdown and return both harrowing and heartbreaking.",

When five-year-old Clara Bynum drowns in the Potomac River under a seemingly haunted rock outcropping known locally as the Three Sisters, the community must reconcile themselves to the bitter tragedy.Clarke powerful charts the fallout from Clara's death on the people she has left behind: her parents, Alice and Willie Bynum, torn between the old world of their rural North Carolina home and the new world of the city; the friends and relatives of the Bynum family in the Georgetown neighborhood they now call home; and, most especially, Clara's sister, ten-year-old Johnnie Mae, who is thrust into adolescence and must come to terms with the terrible and confused emotions stirred by her sister's death. This highly accomplished first novel reverberates with ideas, impassioned lyricism, and poignant historical detail as it captures an essential and moving portrait of the Washington, DC community.",

As Cabot attempts to clear his name, reporter George Tater digs relentlessly for the story that will revive his career and Cameron doggedly pursues the truth about what happened. The result is a full-scale Washington media circus, as a host of interested parties - the president, the press, the senators who must vote yea or nay on Cabot's nomination, and Cabot's friends and enemies - all try to conceal, expose, or spin what he did and why.Closely paralleling these events is a different kind of conspiracy. A clandestine militia of angry Vietnam vets, convinced that officials in high places have deliberately abandoned American POWs, plot a confrontation - both clever and rash - calculated to violently disrupt Cabot's confirmation hearings.",

        "Description": "Is there anyone out there who isn't worried about staying far in front of the technological tidal wave that is making products smarter and changing everything about what customers buy, how they buy, and where their loyalty goes?Don Peppers and Martha Rogers, authors of the international bestseller The One to One Future, go beyond that now classic work on how to sell more products to fewer customers. For the last several years, they have been teaching companies how to stay at the head of the pack by harnessing technology to achieve killer competitive advantages in customer loyalty and unit margin. In this brave new world where microchip technology is making it possible for houses to know their occupants better than the occupants know their own houses--know the owners' temperature preferences, water use, lights, appliances--businesses have a great advantage in building unbreakable customer relationships. Peppers and Rogers explain what kinds of strategies are applicable to what kinds of businesses, and under what circumstances--from cars to credit cards, clothing manufacturers to dry cleaners, long distance phone companies to computer resellers. Suddenly car manufacturers, supermarkets, credit card companies, and fashion houses can compete not on commodity rules and price wars, but on bold new rules. Readers of Enterprise One to One will learn:* How to improve customer retention, not just incrementally but dramatically, and increase your share of each customer's business over time, despite the increasingly frantic nature of your competitors' campaigns. * How to protect and increase your unit margin despite the commoditization that has begun to infect every business in every category.* How to create entirely new markets of individual customers with diverse needs.* How to make the transition to the Interactive Age, gaining advantages from new technologies without being threatened by them.No book on marketing is as firmly planted in the competitive future as Enterprise One to One.Don Peppers is president and founder of Marketing 1:1, Inc., based in Stamford, Connecticut. Martha Rogers, Ph.D., is a founding partner at Marketing 1:1, Inc., and professor of telecommunications at Bowling Green State University. Together they are the authors of the bestselling book The One to One Future.",
