        "Authors": "By Rachlin, Harvey",
        "Description": "Imagine what it might be like to sit in the cockpit of the Wright brothers' airplane, to see light flashing brilliantly through the Hope Diamond, or to turn the pages of Anne Frank's heartbreaking diary. History has bequeathed to us a multitude of marvelous artifacts, and locked inside each one is a piece of the endless story of our civilization.Raconteur Harvey Rachlin uses these intriguing objects to bring history alive. He spins compelling tales, telling us not only about the roles these objects played but also about the people who possessed them or were affected by them, and how the artifacts were handed down through the ages. He begins in antiquity, with the story of the Black Stone of the Ka'bah, the symbolic core of Islam, and moves through time, to the rifle that was used to shoot President Kennedy. He reveals startling new details about familiar artifacts such as the bones of the hominid Lucy and George Washington's false teeth. He introduces us to obscure curiosities, like the Blood of Saint Januarius, which mysteriously liquefies on certain days of the year. And Rachlin explains how the everyday articles that Teddy Roosevelt carried in his pocket miraculously saved his life. Learn where each object currently resides, including how London Bridge found its way to Arizona, or what ultimately happened to the bones of John Merrick, the \"Elephant Man.\"",

        "Description": "The enterprising Larry Wyler, settled in St. Paul with his beloved Iris, an earnest Democrat out to save the world, sits upstairs and writes stories and lands one in The New Yorker, the Canaanland of all English majors. While Iris devotes herself to rescuing demented geezers and chemically dependent single moms, he sets his sights on literary prominence.When his first novel, Spacious Skies, becomes a hit, he leaves Iris behind and buys a Manhattan apartment with a fabulous terrace and moves into an office at The New Yorker among Salinger, Trillin, Updike, Powers - writers he admires - and the great editor William Shawn.Wyler and Shawn become pals, sailing around New York Harbor on the Shawnee, drinking man-size martinis, but Wyler's followup novel, Amber Waves of Grain, bombs badly. (\"Why did I write so much about soybeans in the first chapter?\" he wonders.) And then comes a long spell of writer's block. Wyler despairs until out of nowhere comes an invitation to write a newspaper advice column, \"Ask Mr. Blue\" - a low rung on the literary ladder, but writing commonsense advice to the lonely and the frustrated provides a much-needed distraction and initiates Larry's own long recovery. As he doles out wisdom to Exasperated, whose wife gives up her judgeship for figure skating, and Nice Lady, who is abusive to the obese, and Secular Humanist, who suddenly notices his girlfriend is Amish, Wyler slowly, painfully finds a measure of clarity for his own life. He confronts the evil New Yorker publisher Tony Crossandotti and sets out to win back his wife's affections.",

        "Title": "Cloak and Dollar: The History of American Secret Intelligence",
        "Authors": "By Jeffreys-Jones, Rhodri",
        "Description": "Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones, a leading expert on the history of American espionage, here offers a lively and sweeping history of American secret intelligence from the founding of the nation through the present day. Jeffreys-Jones chronicles the extraordinary expansion of American secret intelligence from the 1790s, when George Washington set aside a discretionary fund for covert operations, to the beginning of the twenty-first century, when United States intelligence expenditure exceeds Russia\u2019s total defense budget.How did the American intelligence system evolve into such an enormous and costly bureaucracy? Jeffreys-Jones argues that hyperbolic claims and the impulse toward self-promotion have beset American intelligence organizations almost from the outset. Allan Pinkerton, whose nineteenth-century detective agency was the forerunner of modern intelligence bureaus, invented assassination plots and fomented anti-radical fears in order to demonstrate his own usefulness. Subsequent spymasters likewise invented or exaggerated a succession of menaces ranging from white slavery to Soviet espionage to digital encryption in order to build their intelligence agencies and, later, to defend their ever-expanding budgets. While American intelligence agencies have achieved some notable successes, Jeffreys-Jones argues, the intelligence community as a whole has suffered from a dangerous distortion of mission. By exaggerating threats such as Communist infiltration and Chinese espionage at the expense of other, more intractable problems\u2014such as the narcotics trade and the danger of terrorist attack\u2014intelligence agencies have misdirected resources and undermined their own objectivity.Since the end of the Cold War, the aims of American secret intelligence have been unclear. Recent events have raised serious questions about effectiveness of foreign intelligence, and yet the CIA and other intelligence agencies are poised for even greater expansion under the current administration. Offering a lucid assessment of the origins and evolution of American secret intelligence, Jeffreys-Jones asks us to think also about the future direction of our intelligence agencies.",

        "Title": "Pearl Harbor",
        "Authors": "By Willmott, H. P., Haruo, Tohmatsu, and Johnson, W. Spencer",
        "Description": "\"A date which will live in infamy\"--President Delano Roosevelt, December 7, 1941. Perfectly coinciding with the release of this splendid volume on Memorial Day 2001, Disney will release its high-profile, big-budget, and star-powered film, Pearl Harbor. The excitement will leave viewers craving a closer look at the real event--and this eye-popping, large-size, and image-packed book will keep readers fascinated long after the movie has left the screen. Directed by visual master Michael Bay (The Rock, Armageddon), produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (who not only masterminded Bay's hits, but also Flashdance, Top Gun, Days of Thunder, Crimson Tide, among others), and with a cast that includes Oscar(r) winners Ben Affleck and Cuba Gooding, the film is sure to dominate the news and to pique curiosity about the subject.It was the battle that would change the course of history. 2,395 military and civilian personnel killed. Another 1,178 wounded. 21 ships sunk, beached, or damaged. 323 aircraft destroyed. It wasn't yet eight in the morning on the island of Oahu when Japan's Commander Fuchida radioed these code words to the Land of the Rising Sun's navy: TORA, TORA, TORA. The Japanese surprise attack on the United States had succeeded; Pearl Harbor was burning. Through bold and striking images previously unseen outside of Japan, and an authoritative, thoroughly up-to-date text, you'll look back at the shocking event. Enhancing your experience further are the standout--and very special--maps and graphics by Malcolm Swanston (expert cartographer of the History of Warfare series). Starting long before the assault and continuing through to the dramatic aftermath, H.P. Willmott, a brilliant and experienced writer on the topic, breaks new ground and corrects long-held misconceptions. First he brings the background into clear focus, charting Japan's emergence as a power in the Far East, and the military involvement in Manchuria and China that put her on a collision course with the U.S. Above all, Willmott makes sense of the complex, often surreal process that led the Japanese High Command to consider an attack on Pearl Harbor the preferred strategy. The text about the strike itself draws on extensive, deeply compelling new research. Highlights include concise tables listing every warship involved in the operation--from aircraft carriers to midget submarines--along with every formation of aircraft, which carriers they flew from, and which targets they hit. Most controversial: a discussion of crucial evidence that explains why a third-and potentially-devastating strike on the American base never occurred. Finally, you'll see why this fateful day may have been not only the day that Japan started the war...but also the day she lost it. Arguing strongly that the act of violence served as the prelude to her defeat, Willmott places Pearl Harbor in its proper military context, and considers subsequent developments in the Pacific, particularly the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway in 1942, as well as the Doolittle Raid by American bombers on Tokyo in April of the same year.",

        "Authors": "By Pruzan, Todd and Mortimer, Favell Lee",
        "Description": "A caustic, cranky, and inadvertently hilarious look at foreign countries and their customs by a Victorian woman who rarely left the house.No matter who your ancestors were, and where they had the misfortune of living, Victorian children's book writer Mrs. Favell Lee Mortimer had something nasty to say about them. Their faults, according to Mrs. Mortimer, might have amounted to just about anything. The Irish \"are very kind and good-natured when pleased, but if affronted, are filled with rage.\" In Italy, \"the people are ignorant and wicked.\" In Sweden, \"Nothing useful is well done...The carpenters and the blacksmiths are very clumsy in their work.\"Remarkably, all of these assertions come from a woman who only twice set foot outside of her native England. But lack of personal experience never kept Mrs. Mortimer from dispensing her horrifying wisdom about the evils of just about every nation on earth. Whether describing Europe (\"It is dreadful to think what a number of murders are committed in Italy\"), Asia (\"The religion of Taou teaches men to act like madmen\"), Africa (\"The worst quality in any character is hypocrisy, and this is to be found in the Egyptian\"), or America (\"New Orleans is a dangerous place to live in, both for the body and the soul\"), Mrs. Mortimer's views are consistently appalling. One hundred fifty years later, three of her forgotten classics have been compiled into one volume, The Clumsiest People in Europe, reviving the comically misinformed and startling prejudices of this unique Victorian eccentric.",

        "Description": "Their albums enter the charts at #1. Fans follow them around the country, soaking up the incredible energy of their sold-out live concerts. From gigging at an Earth Day celebration and more frat parties than anyone can remember, Dave Matthews and his phenomenal band have electrified rock 'n' roll America. Now a music industry insider takes you to the heart of the Dave Matthews Band -- their meteoric rise to superstardom and the most extensive listing ever published of their tours and smash recordings, including the bootlegs that the band encourages.  Charlottesville, Virginia, 1991: Dave Matthews meets and jams with drummer Carter Beauford, bassist Stefan Lessard, saxophonist Leroi Moore, and violinist Boyd Tinsley. The band tours extensively for the next two years and puts out the self-released live album, Remember Two Things. Their enthusiastic grass-roots following in the Southeast and groove-ridden jams earn them a major label deal with RCA Records and the release of Under the Table and Dreaming, giving fans two smash hits and garnering a pair of Grammy nominations. But it is the heartfelt ballad \"Crash Into Me\" from their third album, Crash, that vaults them into the alternative-rock mainstream. Superb critical acclaim for their fourth bestselling set, Before These Crowded Streets, lands Dave on the cover of Spin, dubbed \"the King of Rock.\"  Through interviews with close associates, collaborators, tour mates, and friends, along with a complete discography and \"gigography\" (the definitive list of all the band's phenomenal live shows), this book takes you inside the Dave Matthews universe. This multiracial quintet's unique mix of jazz, blue-eyed funk, world rhythms, and sensitive lyricism speaks to people across generations.",

Leading the reader into the Palace is Sebastian, a young German-American whose fate is to be intimately involved with the lives and deaths of others: the father who disappeared mysteriously, the ancestors whose stories become vitally relevant, and some of the towering figures of twentieth-century legal history, including Justice Robert Jackson, Albert Speer, Hermann Goering, and the dark, untried shadow of Adolf Hitler. In a gripping account of warmakers who must face the consequences of their actions, Nuremberg: The Reckoning flows through Warsaw, Berlin, Lodz, Munich, Hamburg, and finally Nuremberg, as Sebastian, an interpreter-interrogator, comes to terms with his family legacy and his national identity. With his customary authority and audacity, William F. Buckley Jr. has taken a pivotal moment in history and shaped it into absorbing and original fiction. The result is a riveting novel of insight and deep understanding exploring the characters and issues that made history.",

First one must catch one's parrot, of course, and build the hearth to bake it, but that is all in a day's work for the woman pioneer. This riveting anthology tells the story of over 100 such women spanning the age of Empire from the early seventeenth century to the early twentieth. Almost half of them are settlers in North America and Canada, a quarter in Africa, many in Australasia and India, and the rest scattered around the globe from Egypt to Jamaica, Sarawak to Samoa, and many points inbetween.  From the lowliest kitchen skivvy to ambassadors' wives, this book celebrates the emigrants who settled the wildernesses of the world in search of new and better lives. Many were lured abroad by the promise of work or fortune; some went because imperial duty called, while for others it was a most unfeminine lust for adventure that drew them away. But all faced challenges in their homes from home that were to test to the limit their spirits, their resourcefulness, even their survival.",

        "Authors": "By Black, Edwin",
        "Description": "New York Times and international bestselling author Edwin Black uncovers Iraq's hidden economy and the companies that profit from its upheaval  Big business and global warfare have long been fiery and symbiotic forces in Iraq. Banking on Baghdad tells the dramatic and tragic history of a land long the center of world commerce-and documents the many ways Iraq's recent history mirrors its tumultuous past. Tracing the involvement  of Western governments and militaries, as well as oil, banking, and other corporate interests in Iraq, Black shows that today, just as yesterday, the world needs Iraq's resources-and is always willing to fight and invade in order to acquire and protect them.  While demonstrating that Iraq itself is partially to blame for its current state of turmoil, Black does not shy away from the uncomfortable truth that war and profit have also played an equal part in creating the Iraq we know today. Just as he did in IBM and the Holocaust, Black exposes the hidden associations between leading corporations, war, and oil-such as the astonishing connections between Nazi Germany, Iraq, and the Holocaust.  He exposes the war and race-based profiteering by some of the world's most prestigious corporations, as well as the political and economic ties between the Bush administration and the companies that gain handsomely from its foreign policy. Just as he did in War Against the Weak, Black offers a compelling blend of history and contemporary investigative journalism that spans a century and eschews easy answers for complicated questions.  Edwin Black (Washington, DC) is the award-winning New York Times bestselling author of IBM and the Holocaust, The Transfer Agreement, and War Against the Weak. His journalism has appeared in the Washington Post, The Village Voice, The Sunday Times (of London), and The Los Angeles Times.",

How can we influence the outcome? This action-oriented book identifies the key issues, explores the evidence, and suggests some answers. Avoiding both utopianism and despair, the book presents the voices of technology enthusiasts and skeptics, as well as social activists. The book is organized into three parts. Part I examines the issues in their socio-technical, economic, and historical contexts. Part II\u2014the core of the book\u2014proposes five initiatives for using computers and electronic communications to benefit low-income urban communities:- to provide access to the new technologies in ways that enable low-income people to become active producers rather than passive users;- to use the new technologies to improve the dialogue between public agencies and low-income neighborhoods;- to help low-income youth to exploit the entrepreneurial potential of information technologies;- to develop approaches to education that take advantage of the educational capabilities of the computer;- to promote the community computer: applications of computers and communications technology that foster community development. Part III presents a synthesis of the various topics. Its main questions are, What are the prospects and problems of initiatives to enable the poor to benefit from the new technologies? and What federal, state, and municipal policies would enhance the prospects for success?ContributorsAlice Amsden, Jeanne Bamberger, Anne Beamish, Manuel Castells, Joseph Ferreira, Peter Hall, Leo Marx, William J.

A child of the Renaissance, with a precocious mind and a talent for drawing, Alessandra is intoxicated by the painter\u2019s abilities.But their burgeoning relationship is interrupted when Alessandra\u2019s parents arrange her marriage to a wealthy, much older man. Meanwhile, Florence is changing, increasingly subject to the growing suppression imposed by the fundamentalist monk Savonarola, who is seizing religious and political control. Alessandra and her native city are caught between the Medici state, with its love of luxury, learning, and dazzling art, and the hellfire preaching and increasing violence of Savonarola\u2019s reactionary followers. Played out against this turbulent backdrop, Alessandra\u2019s married life is a misery, except for the surprising freedom it allows her to pursue her powerful attraction to the young painter and his art.The Birth of Venus is a tour de force, the first historical novel from one of Britain\u2019s most innovative writers of literary suspense. It brings alive the history of Florence at its most dramatic period, telling a compulsively absorbing story of love, art, religion, and power through the passionate voice of Alessandra, a heroine with the same vibrancy of spirit as her beloved city.",

So, 23-year-old Jennifer decides to pursue peaceful (permanent) oblivion on the beach near her home in Venice, California, drifting on a lethal combination of Xanax and tequila. But she can't even get that right.Jennifer's depression is no match for her Nana's determination. Gabby Zuckerman refuses to let her granddaughter self-destruct. With promises made to Jennifer's father and doctors, Gabby whisks Jennifer back to her home in New York City, intending to prove to Jennifer that her life cannot possibly be over yet. In fact, it has just begun. Through jaunts in Central Park to road trips to Maine, Gabby teaches Jennifer how to trust and hope again. And by relating her own tragic and heroic experience during the Nazi occupation of Poland, Gabby bestows upon Jennifer an understanding of her own life's value. But when Gabby reveals a secret--one that proves to be Jennifer's toughest challenge yet--Jennifer struggles to find out whether the gift will sustain her.Combining the unabashedly heart-warming sentiment of Robert James Waller's The Bridges of Madison County or Nicholas Sparks's Message in a Bottle with the irreverent humor of Jennifer Weiner's In Her Shoes, Goldstein's All That Matters is an inspirational first novel that leads readers to the core of what matters in life--family, hope, and savoring each moment.",

Was Jesus really married to Mary Magdalene?Did he father a child with her? Did Constantine suppress the earliest Gospels and invent the doctrine of Christ's divinity? Do the Gnostic Gospels represent the true Christian faith which the early church sought to supplant?The Da Vinci Code, in blurring the lines between fact and fiction, popularizes the speculations and contentions of numerous more serious books that are also attracting wide attention. How should we respond to claims that we now have documents that reveal secrets about Jesus, secrets long suppressed by the church and other religious institutions? Do these new documents successfully debunk traditional views about Jesus and early Christianity? Ben Witherington III confronts these claims with the sure-footedness of a New Testament scholar, yet in the plain language that any interested reader can follow. He takes us back to the early centuries after Jesus' death and tells us what we can really know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, the canonical Gospels and their Gnostic rivals.",

In fact, each essay begins with a question you might commonly hear in conversation about these alleged shortcomings, to which Bracey provides a brief, sound-byte-ready rebuttal.

Acclaimed author Judith Guest makes a triumphant return with this poignant and powerful novel that's sure to add luster to her reputation as one of the most thoughtful observers of the human condition.  Taking as part of her inspiration a baffling, unsolved true-life crime, Guest achieves in this absorbing new novel an extraordinary combination of page-turning mystery and intimate, emotionally charged family drama.  The Tarnished Eye takes readers to the community of Blessed, in northern Michigan, where Sheriff Hugh DeWitt still grieves for his infant son, who died of SIDS a few years earlier. Obsessed with the past, he's endangering his future with his beloved wife and daughter.  Meanwhile, up the road from the DeWitts, in one of the rich summer cottages, Paige Norbois grieves for a lost love of her own. Married to a stern and unresponsive man, Paige wills herself to stay in the marriage and sacrifice her personal feelings for the sake of her children's stability.  But soon an unimaginable tragedy destroys all dreams of stability in Blessed. Paige, her husband, Edward, and their four children are brutally slaughtered in their home. Sheriff DeWitt, deeply moved by the horrific murder scene, must find answers to a string of urgent questions.  When, exactly, did the murders occur? Why did nobody miss the family earlier? Who had a motive to kill? The man with whom Paige was having an affair? The business partner, who was stealing from Edward's publishing firm? Which family member was the primary, intended victim? And above all, what sort of trauma could fuel a killer's capacity to commit such hate-driven violence?  Judith Guest, with her own untarnished eye and finely nuanced prose, delivers a novel that transcends genre and showcases once again her remarkable literary gifts.",

        "Description": "America's leading expert on democracy delivers the first insider's account of the U.S. occupation of Iraq-a sobering and critical assessment of  America's effort to implant democracy In the fall of 2003, Stanford professor Larry Diamond received a call from Condoleezza Rice, asking if he would spend several months in Baghdad as an adviser to the the American occupation authorities. Diamond had not been a supporter of the war in Iraq, but he felt that the task of building a viable democracy was a worthy goal now that Saddam Hussein's regime had been overthrown. He also thought he could do some good by putting his academic expertise to work in the real world. So in January 2004 he went to Iraq, and the next three months proved to be more of an education than he bargained for.Diamond found himself part of one of the most audacious undertakings of our time. In Squandered Victory he shows how the American effort to establish democracy in Iraq was hampered not only by insurgents and terrorists but also by a long chain of miscalculations, missed opportunities, and acts of ideological blindness that helped assure that the transition to independence would be neither peaceful nor entirely democratic. He brings us inside the Green Zone, into a world where ideals were often trumped by power politics and where U.S. officials routinely issued edicts that later had to be squared (at great cost) with Iraqi realities. His provocative and vivid account makes clear that  Iraq-and by extension, the United States-will spend many years climbing its way out of the hole that was dug during the fourteen months of the American occupation.",

They took fifty-two Americans hostage and kept nearly all of them captive 444 days.The Iran hostage crisis was a watershed moment in American history. It was America's first showdown with Islamic fundamentalism, a confrontation at the forefront of American policy to this day. It was also a powerful dramatic story that captivated the American people, launched yellow-ribbon campaigns, made celebrities of the hostage's families, and crippled the reelection campaign of President Jimmy Carter.Mark Bowden tells this sweeping story through the eyes of the hostages, their radical, na\u00efve captors, the soldiers sent on the impossible mission to free them, and the diplomats working to end the crisis. Taking listeners from the Oval Office to the hostages' cells, Guests of the Ayatollah is a remarkably detailed, brilliantly re-created, and suspenseful account of a crisis that gripped and ultimately changed the world. On November 4, 1979, a group of radical Islamist students, inspired by revolutionary Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini, stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran. They took fifty-two Americans hostage and kept nearly all of them captive 444 days.The Iran hostage crisis was a watershed moment in American history. It was America's first showdown with Islamic fundamentalism, a confrontation at the forefront of American policy to this day. It was also a powerful dramatic story that captivated the American people, launched yellow-ribbon campaigns, made celebrities of the hostage's families, and crippled the reelection campaign of President Jimmy Carter.Mark Bowden tells this sweeping story through the eyes of the hostages, their radical, na\u00efve captors, the soldiers sent on the impossible mission to free them, and the diplomats working to end the crisis. Taking listeners from the Oval Office to the hostages' cells, Guests of the Ayatollah is a remarkably detailed, brilliantly re-created, and suspenseful account of a crisis that gripped and ultimately changed the world.",

        "Title": "Adam Smith",
        "Authors": "By West, E. G.",
        "Description": "Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations, was no dry pedant. His lectures and writings are alive with examples taken from the busy eighteenth-century world around him, and Edmund Burke praised his literary style as \u201crather painting than writing.\u201d It was Adam Smith who taught moral philosophy and literary criticism to Boswell at the University of Glasgow, and in Smith\u2019s works we follow his interests from political history to law, sociology, economic and social history, philosophy, and English literature.E. G. West brings to life Adam Smith\u2019s first years in the bustling Scottish seaport of Kirkcaldy (and recounts Smith\u2019s brief kidnapping, as a baby, by gypsies). We follow young Smith as a student, watch his thought develop as Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow, and enjoy with him the hospitality of David Hume, the Parisian literary salons, Johnson, Burke, Gibbon, and other giants of the era.West gives us a masterful summary of The Wealth of Nations. Even more significant, West restores to eminence an earlier work of Smith\u2019s, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. \u201cIf The Wealth of Nations had never been written,\u201d he asserts, \u201cthis previous work would have earned for him a prominent place in intellectual history.\u201d West takes particular delight in using The Theory of Moral Sentiments to rebut Marx\u2019s assumptions about laissez-faire capitalism.E. G. West was educated at the University College of Exeter, graduating in economics in 1948. He has taught at several British colleges and at Carleton University in Ottawa, and has been a visiting research scholar at the University of Chicago and the University of California at Berkeley and a visiting professor at the Center for Study of Public Choice, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Dr. West authored several books including Education and the State and Education and the Industrial Revolution. His articles have appeared in numerous periodicals and scholarly journals.",

        "Title": "Jew Vs Jew: The Struggle For The Soul Of American Jewry",
        "Authors": "By Freedman, Samuel G.",
        "Description": "At a time when American Jews should feel more secure and cohesive than ever, civil war is tearing apart their community. Congregations, neighborhoods, even families are taking sides in battles about Jewish identity and Jewish authenticity.The conflict pits fundamentalist against secularist, denomination against denomination, even liberal against conservative within each branch of Jewry. Jew vs. Jew tells the story of how American Jewry has increasingly -- and perhaps terminally -- broken apart in the last forty years.  Jew vs. Jew stretches in time from 1960 to 2000. It travels the country from Florida to New England, from Los Angeles to the Catskills in New York, from Cleveland to Denver, and it also crosses the ocean to Israel to show how tensions within the Jewish state inflame those among American Jews. The flash-points range from conversion standards to the role of women, from the peace process in Israel to the sexual climate on an Ivy League campus. But behind them all, as Samuel Freedman writes, lie common causes. First, far from unifying American Jews, Israel now divides them on both political and religious grounds. Second, neither America nor the larger world presents Jews with a single enemy against whom to coalesce. Third, and most important, nothing in the Jewish history of persecution, oppression, and exile prepared the Chosen People for the challenge posed by America, the challenge of being absorbed into a tolerant and diverse nation, being accepted so thoroughly that the intermarriage rate tops 50 percent.  Jew vs. Jew introduces readers to memorable places and characters. Freedman describes one of the final summers at a Labor Zionist camp in the Catskills whose brand of secular Jewishness is becoming obsolete because Zionism succeeded in creating Israel. He tells the story of Orthodox and Reform Jews in a Cleveland suburb who are fighting about the construction of several synagogues -- and, on a deeper level, about whether unity or pluralism ought to be the goal of Jewish life. He portrays a Florida Jew so violently opposed to the Oslo peace accords that he planted a bomb in a synagogue where Shimon Peres was speaking. He tells about a Los Angeles congregation that spent three years debating whether or not to honor the Biblical matriarchs in its liturgy.We come to know the Long Island neighbors who cannot tolerate sharing even a property line because their versions of Jewish identity are so irreconcilably different.  Jew vs. Jew is a work of vigorous reporting, lucid writing, and intellectual curiosity. And even as it chronicles an embittered and polarized community, it refuses to take sides or pass judgment. Instead, with compassion and acuity, Jew vs. Jew bears witness.",

Claiming to be the teenage brother of their dear friend Tarek, prince of the mysterious Lost Oasis, the charismatic herald brings troubling news of a strange malady that has struck down Tarek's heir and conveys his brother's urgent need for help only the Emersons can provide.Driven by loyalty -- and a fear that the evil forces opposing Tarek's rule will now exploit the royal heir's grave illness -- the family sets off in secret for the land time forgot -- a mountain fortress from which they narrowly escaped ten years before. Braving the treacherous desert climate on a trek fraught with danger at every turning, guided only by a crumbling map, the Emersons are unaware that deception is leading them onward into a nest of vipers -- where a dreadful fate may await. For young Ramses, forced to keep his growing love for the beautiful Nefret secret, temptation along the way may prove his ultimate undoing. And a dark past and grim obligation have ensnared Nefret once again, as she is helpless to save those she loves most from the prison of the Lost Oasis.Guardian of the Horizon is rich with suspense, surprises, unforgettable characters, and the intoxicating atmosphere that has earned its author the coveted title of Grand Master two times over. The remarkable Elizabeth Peters proves once again that, in the world of historical adventure fiction, she is truly without peer.",

In their case, it is because Romiette is African-American and Julio is Hispanic, and the Devildogs, a dangerous local gang, violently oppose their interracial relationship.  When the Devildogs threaten to teach them a lesson, Romiette and Julio come up with a risky plan to escape from the gang's fearsome shadow. But things go terribly awry, and the two find themselves caught up in a deadly reality more frightening that Romiette's nightmare -- and in a desperate struggle to avoid the tragic fate of Shakespeare's famous young lovers.",

Warlike, flamboyant, courageous - the ancient  Celts had a fearsome reputation, even among the bellicose Romans.  For 500 years they dominated the barbarian lands north of the  Alps, before being largely absorbed into the Roman Empire. But  Celtic culture survived and achieved a glorious flowering in the  post-Roman, early Christian era. Today Celtic influence can be  found everywhere, in arts and crafts, in legends, in placenames  and even in the languages we speak. In this new introduction to  the world of the Celts, Simon James looks at all aspects of their  history. Individual sections chart their rise, their way of life  from farming to feasting, their wars, their gods, and their  superb craftsmanship. Also highlighted are the hitherto neglected  subject of Celtic life under Roman rule and persistent traditions  that led to the Celtic renaissance in Ireland after AD 400.  Original features include the latest discoveries; extracts from  classical authors; illustrated retellings of the most famous  myths and legends; tables of comparative information; diagrams,  maps and site plans. The Celts once held sway over much of  Europe, from Caledonia to Asia Minor. Here is the whole story of  this immensely inventive and influential people.",

        "Description": "\"Jack Maggs is a dazzling tale of obsession, and Jack Maggs stands as a remarkable character, a resurrected antipodean lag returned to England for vengeance and reconciliation.\"--Thomas Keneally From the Booker Prize-winning author, a vivid and robust novel of Dickensian London--a place and a story teeming with mystery, science, and passion.The time, the 1830s. Jack Maggs, a foundling trained in the fine arts of thievery, cruelly betrayed and deported to Australia, has now reversed his fortunes--and seeks to fulfill his well-concealed, innermost desire. Returning \"home\" under threat of execution, he inveigles his way into a household in Great Queen Street, where he's quickly embroiled in various emotional entanglements--and where he falls under the hypnotic scrutiny of Tobias Oates, a celebrated young writer fascinated by the process of mesmerism and obsessed with the criminal mind.From this volatile milieu emerges a handful of vividly drawn characters in the dangerous pursuit of love, whether romantic or familial--each of them with secrets, and secret longings, that could spell certain ruin. And as their various schemes converge, the captivating figure at the center is Jack Maggs himself, at once frightening, mystifying, and utterly compelling.  \"Imaginative and audacious . . . A twentieth-century, post-colonial Dickens novel . . . This strange, bold, gripping, and wonderful novel is the story of a power struggle, a double love story, a quest story, and a story of trickery and disguise. It's about taking possession--of an inheritance, of another person's soul, of your own destiny--and being taken possession of. Not least, it's the story of one writer's being possessed by another.\"--Hermione Lee, The Observer \"Uncommonly exciting and engaging. As much as anyone now writing, Peter Carey is a master of storytelling. His empathy with his characters, combined with his psychological sharp-sightedness, has them almost jumping off the page in full human complexity. An especial bonus is his style . . . Vivid, exact, unexpected images and language match the quick, witty intelligence flickering through this novel, and make it a triumph of ebullient indictment, humane insight, and creative generosity.\"--Peter Kemp, Sunday Times (London) \"Writing and philosophical contemplations of the highest order . . . On a par with, and more interesting than, his two earlier masterpieces . . . An absorbing, beautifully written novel finished off with a most satisfactory happy ending, and with incidents, an atmosphere, and ideas that linger in the mind.\"--Carmen Callil, The Daily Telegraph",

        "Description": "Considered by author Philippe de Vosjoli as &#147;the first domesticated species of lizard,\u201d the leopard gecko has fast become &#147;the reptilian version of the parakeet or goldfish.\u201d Leopard Geckos takes a close look at the characteristics of this species that have made these attractive lizards so amazingly popular in the pet world. As a hardy, easy care, and potentially long-lived lizard, the leopard gecko is the perfect size, attractive in its velvety skin, and fairly easy to breed. The subject of breeding geckos is covered in multiple chapters in this book led by author and herp expert de Vosjoli, who is joined by gecko specialists Dr. Roger Klingenberg, Ron Tremper, and Dr. Brian Viets, who each contribute special chapters to this up-to-date and authoritative guide.  Colorfully illustrated, Leopard Geckos provides excellent general guidelines for keepers who wish to add a gecko to their vivarium and maintain their pet in excellent health and condition. The authors provide an introduction to gecko characteristics including distribution, size, longevity, and growth rate, to help beginners better understand the anatomy and behavior of these fascinating lizards. This Advanced Vivarium Systems title includes information about selecting a healthy leopard gecko, handling, housing needs, water and feeding requirements, and shedding and tail loss. Dr. Klingenberg provides the chapter &#147;The Recognition and Treatment of Disease,\u201d which covers specific disorders keepers should be aware of. De Vosjoli begins the discussion on breeding leopard geckos, and then is joined by Dr. Viets for a chapter on &#147;Incubation Temperature and Hatchling Sex and Pigmentation.\u201d Tremper\u2019s chapter on &#147;Color and Pattern Variations\u201d focuses on the genetic aspects of breeding leopard geckos. The book also discusses the African fat-tailed gecko plus other eublepharids, including the African clawed gecko, Japanese leopard gecko, Malaysian cat gecko, and the Central American banded gecko.",
