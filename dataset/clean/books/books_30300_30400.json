Now, twenty years later, Spencer receives an invitation to an execution. After two decades on death row, a date has finally been set to strap Fate Harkryder into the chair and throw the switch. But time has eroded Spencer's moral certainty of guilt and raised the specter of another murder.Over a century ago, it is said that a man was murdered in his sleep, that a young wife and mother was accused of the crime, and that on the gallows her last words were silenced by her father's order. In 1833 Frankie Silver became the first woman in North Carolina to be hanged for murder. But what really happened so long ago becomes an obsession for Spencer Arrowood as the parallels between Frankie and Fate, between two crimes more than a hundred years apart, become as clear - and as shocking - as the single truth that joins two condemned souls. Suddenly, Spencer Arrowood is engaged in a race against time to keep history from happening all over again, and to save the life of a man who just may be innocent after all.",

Yet the more dark secrets Lynley and Havers uncover, the more they learn that neither the victims nor the suspects are who they appear to be.

The Hassitti are able to \"catch dreams\" of distant events and places, and now their visions are bringing vivid, troubled warnings of an unknown danger issuing from the mountains to the west.The apprehensions are soon confirmed by a mysterious plague that is spreading from the western mountains, a deadly foulness that kills everything in its wake. The carrier of evil disease now approaches the domain of the Skritek, dreadful saurian monsters that feed on living flesh, enemies of Oddlings and humans alike, creatures of implacable hatred.Kadiya, with only three Oddlings to accompany her, quests into the Thorny Hell, the Skritek's ichorous realm, to confront the source of the plague and find a means to defeat it. There they find a portal leading to a universe of awesome darkness - a foul entranceway that threatens the very existence of the World of the Three Moons.Golden Trillum is the tumultuous saga of a desperate battle against dark forces, a tale of courage in the face of overwhelming odds, and the story of a love destined to overcome the eternal barriers of time and space.",

Yet it is essentially a Victorian saga, an awesome tale of thrillingly bloodthirsty vampire whose nocturnal atrocities reflect the dark underside of a supremely moralistic age. Above all, Dracula is a quintessential story of suspense and horror, boasting one of the most terrifying characters in literature: centuries-old Count Dracula, whose diabolical passions prey upon the innocent, the helpless, the beautiful. Bram Stoker, who was also the manager of the famous actor Sir Henry Irving, wrote seventeen novels. Dracula remains his most celebrated and enduring work -- even today this Gothic masterpiece has lost none of the spine-tingling impact that makes it a classic of the genre.",

        "Title": "Close to Shore: The Terrifying Shark Attacks of 1916",
        "Authors": "By Capuzzo, Michael",
        "Description": "Combining rich historical detail and a harrowing, pulse-pounding narrative, Close   to Shore brilliantly re-creates the summer of 1916, when a rogue Great White shark   attacked swimmers along the New Jersey shore, triggering mass hysteria and launching   the most extensive shark hunt in history. In July 1916 a lone Great White left its usual deep-ocean habitat and headed in   the direction of the New Jersey shoreline.   There, near the towns of Beach Haven   and Spring Lake--and, incredibly, a farming community eleven miles inland--the most   ferocious and unpredictable of predators began a deadly rampage: the first shark   attacks on swimmers in U.S. history.    Capuzzo interweaves a vivid portrait of the era and meticulously drawn characters   with chilling accounts of the shark's five attacks and the frenzied hunt that ensued. From the unnerving inevitability of the first attack   on the esteemed son of a prosperous Philadelphia physician to the spine-tingling   moment when a farm boy swimming in Matawan Creek feels the sandpaper-like skin of   the passing shark, Close to Shore is an undeniably gripping saga. Heightening the   drama are stories of the resulting panic in the citizenry, press and politicians,   and of colorful personalities such as Herman Oelrichs, a flamboyant millionaire who   made a bet that a shark was no match for a man (and set out to prove it); Museum   of Natural History ichthyologist John Treadwell Nichols, faced with the challenge   of stopping a mythic sea creature about which little was known; and, most memorable,   the rogue Great White itself moving through a world that couldn't conceive of either   its destructive power or its moral right to destroy. Scrupulously researched and   superbly written, Close to Shore brings to life a breathtaking, pivotal moment in   American history. Masterfully written and suffused with fascinating period detail   and insights into the science and behavior of sharks, Close to Shore recounts a breathtaking,   pivotal moment in American history with startling immediacy.",

They live in a beautiful house and lead a glamorous and happy life.Then a random burglary turns their world upside down. A routine police investigation reveals that Tom is not who he says he is.

Although she repeatedly refused to marry Yeats, Maud would become the object of his passion and his poetry. The emotional power in many of Yeats' early poems is shaped by the one-sidedness of his affair with Maud, but the poems themselves remain hopeful and bitter-sweet, pure in their language and attitudes about love.The forty-one poems collected in A Poet to his Beloved represent some of Yeats's most evocative and passionate early love poems. These versed are simple, lyrical, and often dreamy, and they speak knowingly of innocence and beauty, passion and desire, devotion and the fear of rejection.",

        "Description": "A new novel from one of the world's great writers-an extraordinary work set in Mogadiscio, Somalia-that both breaks new ground and brings him back to his literary roots.  A strong, self-reliant woman who was born in Somalia but brought up in North America, Cambara returns to Mogadiscio to escape a failed marriage and an overweening mother. Her journey back to her native home is a desperate attempt to find herself on her own terms-however ironically, in a country where women are expected to wear veils. And she has given herself a mission to reclaim her family's home from the warlord who has taken it as his own.  Cambara finds emotional refuge and practical support with a group of Somali women activists working to broker peace in a country that has been savagely riven by its drug-addled, power-hungry men. Farah's novels have been famous for their unique African feminism since his debut, From a Crooked Rib (just reissued by Penguin); Knots represents his most powerful return to that legacy.  Knots also presents a penetrating portrayal of Somalia's capital city-a city that's changed from the city Westerners saw on CNN and in 'Black Hawk Down,' transformed into a state of violent anarchy and psychological disrepair that has never been more important to understand. An especially intimate portrait of Mogadiscio, it's informed by Farah's own recent efforts to reclaim his family's property there, as well as his experiences trying to negotiate peace among the city's warlords.  Now more than ever, Farah's deeply wise and worldly inside look at the Muslim world is valuable and necessary.",

        "Description": "What happens when a respected Christian journalist decides to put his preconceptions aside and take a long look at the Jesus described in the Gospels? How does the Jesus of the New Testament compare to the ''new, rediscovered' Jesus -- or even the Jesus we think we know so well? Best-selling author Phillip Yancey says, 'The Jesus I got to know in writing this book is very different from the Jesus I learned about in Sunday school. In some ways he is more comforting; in some ways more terrifying.' Yancey offers a new and different perspective on the life of Christ and his work -- his teaching, his miracles, his death and resurrection -- and ultimately, who he was and why he came. Relating the gospel events to the world we live in today, The Jesus I Never Knew gives a moving and refreshing portrait of the central figure of history. With a willingness to tackle difficult questions, Yancey looks at the radical words of this itinerant Jewish carpenter and asks whether we are taking him seriously enough in our own day and age. From the manger in Bethlehem to the cross in Jerusalem, Yancey presents a complex character who generates questions as well as answers; a disturbing and exhilarating Jesus who wants to radically transform your life and stretch your faith. The Jesus I Never Knew uncovers a Jesus who is brilliant, creative, challenging, fearless, compassionate, unpredictable, and ultimately satisfying. This honest book will help you discover a different Jesus from the flannelgraph Sunday school figure, the sweetly smiling Victorian Savior, and all the cultural cliches that have tamed Jesus and kept him in comfortable religious boxes. According to Yancey, 'No one who meets Jesus ever stays the same. In the end I found the process of writing this book to be a great act of faith-strengthening. Jesus has rocked my own preconceptions and has made me ask hard questions about why those of us who bear his name don't do a better job of following him.'",

It makes us who we are and it determines what we do. It's the bane, the pain, the pleasure of our existence. If history has proved anything, it's that there's just no rational way to deal with sex--and this book is a fun and fascinating review of the absurd, amazing, bewildering, frightening, and altogether irrational ways we have dealt with it throughout time. Great Moments in Sex chronicles the whole libidinous, lascivious, and just plain loony story: the tools we've used, the laws we've made, the so-called expert advice from Aristotle to The Joy of Sex, the attempts to repress sex, and the infinitely varied ways it has popped up anyway.",

        "Description": "From Renoir and Picasso to Red Grooms and Guerrilla Girls, this is the most useful reference work on twentieth-century art available in a single volume. Compiled by Ian Chilvers, the editor of The Oxford Dictionary of Art, it is both authoritative and accessible, with generous use of anecdotes and clear explanations of many potentially confusing terms.  Providing broad coverage of painting, sculpture, drawing, and the applied arts, the Dictionary has clear, scholarly entries on the important movements and styles of the twentieth century, including Dada, Cubism, Surrealism, Art Deco, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Body and Performance art, and Neo Expressionism. In addition, it provides entries on art schools and galleries, exhibitions and prizes, terms and techniques. Extensive biographies feature not only artists but also collectors, critics, dealers, and patrons. And though the Dictionary concentrates on the great names, it is not confined to the mainstream of modern art, and features both artists working in a more popular tradition as well as interesting peripheral figures. This up to date and informative guide is an essential reference for anyone interested in modern art.",

This and dozens of other inventive ideas will help you pursue happiness wisely and well.In challenging times, it is easy to question whether happiness is a choice. Alexandra Stoddard affirms that not only is it possible to choose happiness but that happiness is the best choice we can make. It is the \"first principle\" of life that unites humankind because it is what we all desire.Happiness lies in the passions we pursue and in the pressures we decline. It is in knowing how to work and when to play. It is in the treasured objects we keep nearby and in the ordinary moments we elevate into small celebrations. It is in the note we write to a friend and the kindness we show a stranger. Happiness is what you make it, where you make it. Happiness is our best choice.",

The trilobites, which dominated the ocean floors for 300 million years, are gone. The last of the dinosaurs was wiped out by a Mount Everest-sized meteorite that slammed into the earth 65 million years ago. The great flying reptiles are gone, and so are the marine reptiles, some of them larger than a humpback whale. Before humans crossed the Bering land bridge some 15,000 years ago, North America was populated by mastodons, mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, and cave bears. They too are MIA. Passenger pigeons once flew over North America in flocks that numbered in the billions; the last one died in 1914. In this book you will meet creatures that were driven to extinction even more recently, as well as some that were brought back from the brink. You will even encounter animals not known to exist until recently -- an antidote to extinction.",

        "Description": "The remarkable memoir of an Iraqi woman who escaped from captivity in Baghdad and became America's leading undercover counter-terrorist expert.   Here is the story of an anonymous counter-terrorism expert, a young woman, who, in disguise, has penetrated front groups of anti-American terrorist organizations operating in this country. In this edge-of-the-seat memoir, she chronicles her escape from Iraq via Iran to Israel, following a great tragedy that befell her family at the hands of Saddam Hussein. She also details how she became involved in intelligence gathering for the United States, her adoptive country, while working for an antiterrorism group. With her unique insights into how terrorist groups veil their true operations by various means, she was able to infiltrate and identify dangerous terrorist organizations and entities working undetected in the United States. Terrorist Hunter provides fascinating and shocking information on how federal agencies, chiefly the FBI and the State Depart-ment, repeatedly ignored or mishandled important information she provided. She reveals her role in exposing terrorist supporters who the White House considered to be friends, in preventing the government from funding terrorist activities, and in the deportation of terrorists and their supporters. She also reveals how she discovered a billion-dollar scheme that rich Saudi Arabians set up to filter money to terrorist groups, through charities and businesses in the United States -- information that the FBI sat on for years, until after 9-11.",
