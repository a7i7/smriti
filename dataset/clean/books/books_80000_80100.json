        "Title": "Empire of Blue Water: Captain Morgan's Great Pirate Army, the Epic Battle for the Americas, and the Catastrophe That Ended the Outlaws' Bloody Reign",
        "Authors": "By Talty, Stephan",
        "Description": "He challenged the greatest empire on earth with a ragtag bunch of renegades\u2014and brought it to its knees. Empire of Blue Water is the real story of the pirates of the Caribbean.Henry Morgan, a twenty-year-old Welshman, crossed the Atlantic in 1655, hell-bent on making his fortune. Over the next three decades, his exploits in the Caribbean in the service of the English became legendary. His daring attacks on the mighty Spanish Empire on land and at sea determined the fates of kings and queens, and his victories helped shape the destiny of the New World.Morgan gathered disaffected European sailors and soldiers, hard-bitten adventurers, runaway slaves, and vicious cutthroats, and turned them into the most feared army in the Western Hemisphere. Sailing out from the English stronghold of Port Royal, Jamaica, \u201cthe wickedest city in the New World,\u201d Morgan and his men terrorized Spanish merchant ships and devastated the cities where great riches in silver, gold, and gems lay waiting. His last raid, a daring assault on the fabled city of Panama, helped break Spain\u2019s hold on the Americas forever. Awash with bloody battles, political intrigues, natural disaster, and a cast of characters more compelling, bizarre, and memorable than any found in a Hollywood swashbuckler\u2014including the notorious pirate L\u2019Ollonais, the soul-tortured King Philip IV of Spain, and Thomas Modyford, the crafty English governor of Jamaica\u2014Empire of Blue Water brilliantly re-creates the passions and the violence of the age of exploration and empire.",

        "Description": "Nuala Anne McGrail now lives in Chicago with her husband, Dermot, and their new baby, Nelliecoyne. As Nuala fans may suspect, Nelliecoyne is no ordinary baby: she is fey like her mother and can see into the past as well as the future. Nuala is having a hugely successful career as a folksinger but she is being brutally attacked in the media by a schlock-jock named Nick Farmer, who says he's out to push her off the charts. Obsessed with Nuala, he's even gone so far as to threaten to institute proceedings to have her baby taken away from her.Both Nuala and her daughter have sensed strange vibrations from a place on the Lake where a shipload of Irish Americans lost their lives a hundred years ago. The indomitable Nuala, with her ever-faithful husband and the strange and curious help of her infant daughter, begins to work on unraveling the mystery of why and how the ship was sunk and what might be at the bottom of the Lake. In the course of the investigation they make some dangerous enemies and eventually have to solve a murder and find a buried treasure. Will Nuala survive the attacks of Nick Farmer and a dangerous run-in with the Balkan Mafia? And how does the diary kept by a young Irishwoman in the early 1900s play into these events?",

        "Description": "In the remote Himalayas, on the shores of magnificent Lake Lugu, there is a place the Chinese call \"the Country of Daughters.\" This is the home of the Moso, a remarkable society in which women rule men. In the Moso tradition, marriage is considered a backward practice, and property is passed from mother to daughter. Every household has a matriarch who oversees the family's customs, rituals, and economics. Daughters are prized above sons, and both live their entire lives in the house where they were born.In the extraordinary story of Yang Erche Namu, life among the Moso is revealed for the first time in fascinating, intimate detail. Leaving Mother Lake is the story of one girl's coming-of-age in a world of women. From Namu we learn of a young girl's \"skirt ceremony,\" of how courtship is conducted through dance and song, and of the private \"flower chambers\" where young women consort with their lovers. Despite the freedoms Namu enjoys, they aren't the freedoms she desires. Her impulsive, restless nature drives her to leave her mother's house, defying the tradition that holds Moso culture together. She learns she must venture out into the larger world to see better the one she leaves behind.",

        "Description": "When former Miami homicide detective Jane Bunker left her big city life for Green Haven, Maine, she thought she was also leaving behind the pollution, noise, and dead bodies. Well--as any New Englander will tell you--two out of three ain't bad. After solving a murder and surviving a couple of attempts on her life (recounted in the bestselling mystery Slipknot), Jane Bunker believes she's finally earned a respite from murder and intrigue. But if she thinks it's time for her to soak up the peace and quiet she's been seeking, she should think again. On her way back from a routine investigation into some smashed equipment, Jane takes a moment to appreciate the beauty of a Maine autumn--there's the sublime rainbow foliage of the highlands, the serene reflections of the setting sun on the bay's gentle waves, the elegant silhouette of a lobster boat on the bay. But her calm lasts only as long as it takes for Jane to make the chilling discovery that the vessel is in serious trouble with nobody aboard--and that its owner has vanished without a trace. And that's the least of the mysteries. A young mariner dead of a heroin overdose; the real agenda of a charismatic Indian leader; a missing bait iron and a corpse painted red--nothing is what it seems. Fisherman's Bend brings us Greenlaw's pitch-perfect ear for all things maritime. From the eccentric denizens of little Green Haven--Audrey, the punk rock waitress, the delightful Vickersons with their all-mussel cookbook--to the dark undercurrents that run beneath this seemingly idyllic coastal village, Greenlaw's flair for combining humor and Down East flavor with roller-coaster suspense makes this a mystery that will grab you hook, line, and sinker.",

And yet mysteries remain: What was really going on in her brief, impulsive marriages to Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, and whatis going on in her partnership with Brad Pitt? What's behind the oft-reported feud with her father, the Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight? What drove her to become a mother of six children in six years? And--perhaps most puzzling of all--what about the other side of Angelina: How did this talented but troubled young actress, barely 35 years old, become a respected Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations as well as the \"most powerful celebrity in the world\" (unseating Oprah Winfrey) onForbes' 2009 Celebrity 100 list? The answers that Andrew Morton has uncovered are astonishing, taking us deep inside Angelina's world to show us what shaped her as a child, as an actress, and as a woman struggling to overcome personal demons that have never before been revealed. In this spellbinding biography, Andrew Morton draws upon far-reaching original interviews and research, accompanied by exclusive private photographs, to show us the true story behind both the wild excesses of Angelina's youth and her remarkable work with children and victims of poverty and disaster today.",

        "Authors": "By Burke, James Lee",
        "Description": "James Lee Burke\u2019s eagerly awaited new novel finds Detective Dave Robicheaux back in New Iberia, Louisiana, and embroiled in the most harrowing and dangerous case of his career. Seven young women in neighboring Jefferson Davis Parish have been brutally murdered. While the crimes have all the telltale signs of a serial killer, the death of Bernadette Latiolais, a high school honor student, doesn\u2019t fit: she is not the kind of hapless and marginalized victim psychopaths usually prey upon. Robicheaux and his best friend, Clete Purcel, confront Herman Stanga, a notorious pimp and crack dealer whom both men despise. When Stanga turns up dead shortly after a fierce beating by Purcel, in front of numerous witnesses, the case takes a nasty turn, and Clete\u2019s career and life are hanging by threads over the abyss. Adding to Robicheaux\u2019s troubles is the matter of his daughter, Alafair, on leave from Stanford Law to put the finishing touches on her novel. Her literary pursuit has led her into the arms of Kermit Abelard, celebrated novelist and scion of a once prominent Louisiana family whose fortunes are slowly sinking into the corruption of Louisiana\u2019s subculture. Abelard\u2019s association with bestselling ex-convict author Robert Weingart, a man who uses and discards people like Kleenex, causes Robicheaux to fear that Alafair might be destroyed by the man she loves. As his daughter seems to drift away from him, he wonders if he has become a victim of his own paranoia. But as usual, Robicheaux\u2019s instincts are proven correct and he finds himself dealing with a level of evil that is greater than any enemy he has confronted in the past. Set against the backdrop of an Edenic paradise threatened by pernicious forces, James Lee Burke\u2019s The Glass Rainbow is already being hailed as perhaps the best novel in the Robicheaux series.",

        "Authors": "By Bacevich, Andrew J.",
        "Description": "The bestselling author of The Limits of Power critically examines the Washington consensus on national security and why it must changeFor the last half century, as administrations have come and gone, the fundamental assumptions about America's military policy have remained unchanged: American security requires the United States (and us alone) to maintain a permanent armed presence around the globe, to prepare our forces for military operations in far-flung regions, and to be ready to intervene anywhere at any time. In the Obama era, just as in the Bush years, these beliefs remain unquestioned gospel.In a vivid, incisive analysis, Andrew J. Bacevich succinctly presents the origins of this consensus, forged at a moment when American power was at its height. He exposes the preconceptions, biases, and habits that underlie our pervasive faith in military might, especially the notion that overwhelming superiority will oblige others to accommodate America's needs and desires\u2014whether for cheap oil, cheap credit, or cheap consumer goods. And he challenges the usefulness of our militarism as it has become both unaffordable and increasingly dangerous.Though our politicians deny it, American global might is faltering. This is the moment, Bacevich argues, to reconsider the principles which shape American policy in the world\u2014to acknowledge that fixing Afghanistan should not take precedence over fixing Detroit. Replacing this Washington consensus is crucial to America's future, and may yet offer the key to the country's salvation.",

They will be in a strong position to gain a broad understanding and to take specific steps for implementation of effective managing across cultures.In the seventh edition of International Management, Luthans and Doh have taken care to retain the effective foundation gained from research and practice over the past decades. At the same time, they have fully incorporated important new and emerging developments that have changed what international managers are currently facing and likely to face in the coming years. Of special importance is that students of international management understand what will be expected of them from the range of stakeholders with whom they interact.",

In this revised edition of the classic text, Hoffman analyzes the new adversaries, motivations, and tactics of global terrorism that have emerged in recent years, focusing specifically on how al Qaeda has changed since 9/11; the reasons behind its resiliency, resonance, and longevity; and its successful use of the Internet and videotapes to build public support and gain new recruits. Hoffman broadens the discussion by evaluating the potential repercussions of the Iraqi insurgency, the use of suicide bombers, terrorist exploitation of new communications media, and the likelihood of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear terrorist strike.Closer to home, Hoffman reconsiders the Timothy McVeigh case and the threats posed by American Christian white supremacists and abortion opponents as well as those posed by militant environmentalists and animal rights activists. He argues that the attacks on the World Trade Center fundamentally transformed the West's view of the terrorist threat. More relevant and necessary than ever, Inside Terrorism continues to be the definitive work on the history and future of global terrorism.",

Their strange behavior\u2014eating meals at their desks, not completing reading assignments, remaining silent through class discussions\u2014made her feel as if she were dealing with a completely foreign culture. So Nathan decided to do what anthropologists do when confused by a different culture: Go live with them. She enrolled as a freshman, moved into the dorm, ate in the dining hall, and took a full load of courses. And she came to understand that being a student is a pretty difficult job, too. Her discoveries about contemporary undergraduate culture are surprising and her observations are invaluable, making My Freshman Year essential reading for students, parents, faculty, and anyone interested in educational policy.",

In the third edition of their innovative text, Kraft and Furlong take a decidedly different tack. They introduce and integrate an evaluative approach to policy throughout their text, encouraging critical and creative thinking on issues ranging from economic policy and the financial bailout to homeland security and natural disasters.Public Policy starts with the basics and concisely reviews institutions, policy actors, and major theoretical models. The authors then discuss the nature of policy analysis and its practice, and show students how to employ evaluative criteria in six substantive policy areas. At its core, Public Policy guides students through policy alternatives, arming them with analytic tools for understanding how the motivations of policy actors\u2014both within and outside of government\u2014influence a complex, yet comprehensible, policy agenda. Professors will appreciate its authoritative, balanced approach, and its accessibility will engage students and keep them reading.Important features for enhanced readability include: Working with Sources and Steps to Analysis feature boxes that help students apply evaluative criteria; Policy scenario chapter openers;End-of-chapter discussion questions, suggested readings and websites, and keyword lists;\u00a0A wealth of tables, figures, charts, and photos; and\u00a0A helpful keyword glossary in the appendix.In addition to updating throughout all chapters to account for recent events, issues, and policy debates through the end of the Bush presidency, the third edition includes expanded and new coverage of:\u00a0the mortgage crisis, financial bailout, and ensuing recession;the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;\u00a0the use of private contractors for military support and operations;\u00a0homeland security and its implications for civil liberties;\u00a0national energy policy and high gasoline prices, including proposals for increased offshore drilling;climate change issues and politics;\u00a0the government\u2019s capacity to handle natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav, and Ike; andimmigration controversies, including construction of fencing along the U.S.-Mexican border.",

        "Title": "Kaleidoskop (Textbook only) (English and German Edition)",
        "Authors": "By Moeller, Jack",
        "Description": "Kaleidoskop is essentially two books in one: a cultural and literary reader with a comprehensive review of grammar. This combination allows maximum flexibility for instructors to design their own programs. The 10 topics of the Lekt\u00fcre section contain a variety of texts and activities, and the 10 Kapitel of the self-contained grammar section (Grammatik) allow instructors to work with the grammar topics in whatever order they choose; the grammar chapters may be treated independently of the reading chapters or used concurrently with the Themen of the same number. Given these materials the instructor can provide a learner-centered classroom with activities that lend themselves to cooperative learning.Kaleidoskop features a flexible four-skills, learner-centered approach that promotes communication and focuses on the literature and culture of the German-speaking world. Reading plays an important role in this text, with exercises for listening, speaking and writing revolving around the wide range of authentic reading selections. These texts are authentic and include advertisements, charts, newspaper and magazine articles, letters, e-mails, forum mails, polls, interviews, biographies, songs, poems, and fiction.",

        "Title": "Writers Dreaming",
        "Authors": "By Epel, Naomi",
        "Description": "On a spring morning in the early seventies, William Styron woke to the resonant, lingering image of a woman he had known before. She was, he recalls, \"entering the hallway of this humble boarding house in Flatbush with a book under her arm, looking very beautiful in the middle of summer with a sort of summer dress on and her arm bared and the tattoo visible. . . . I was seized by this absolute sense of necessity - I had to write the book.\" Styron immediately went to his studio and, abandoning the novel he had been struggling to complete, wrote the opening paragraphs of Sophie's Choice.A remarkable number of talented artists find ideas and inspiration in the intermingling of dreams with their working life. The deep connection between the subconscious and the imagination has allowed these writers to solve problems, rewrite scenes and discover hidden truths in their writing. \"Part of the beauty of dreams,\" explains Allan Gurganus, \"is that they're eternally mysterious. And that's part of their meaning and power for us. They seem to have a kind of wisdom that we don't have in our waking lives.\"In this fascinating book, dream researcher and radio-show host Naomi Epel has compiled hours of interviews with twenty-six well-known writers to offer a behind-the-scenes look at the workings of the imagination. In their own words, they discuss the dreams that have had a powerful effect on their work and their lives, revealing in the process their philosophies, habitual rituals and ways of solving creative problems.Writers Dreaming is a unique anthology of wisdom from some of the most important writers in contemporary literature, allowing us to understand how they summon forth their ideas and fashion them into art. Its frank and revealing narrative provides a rare insight into the wellsprings of creativity.",

Yet, Barack Obama doesn\u2019t seem to share that view. To him, liberty is a threat to the government\u2019s power and something to be squashed by any means possible, as bestselling author David Limbaugh shows to devastating affect in his new book, Crimes Against Liberty. In Crimes Against Liberty, Limbaugh issues a damning indictment of President Barack Obama for encroaching upon and stripping us of our individual and sovereign rights. Laying out his case like he would a criminal complaint, Limbaugh presents the evidence\u2014count-by-count\u2014against Obama. From exploiting the financial crisis for political gain, to restricting our personal freedoms through invasive healthcare and \u201cgreen\u201d policies, to endangering America with his feckless diplomacy and reckless dismantlement of our national security systems, Limbaugh proves\u2014beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014that Obama is guilty of crimes against liberty. Comprehensive and compelling, this is Limbaugh\u2019s most powerful book yet.",

        "Description": "Written specifically for students, this ethnography provides an engaging, real-life account of the transition from a traditional to a modern culture. It uses vibrant personal stories and ethnographic examples to connect developments among the Gebusi of Papua New Guinea to key topics in cultural anthropology, including comparative features of subsistence, kinship, politics, religion, gender, ethnicity, nationalism, and modern development.  In the early 1980s, the Gebusi conducted ritual dances and spirit seances, practiced alternative sexual customs, and endured high rate of violence.  By 1998, most Gebusi had converted to Christianity and were actively engaged in market activity, disco music, sports leagues, and school.  In 2008, however, public services and the cash economy had deteriorated, and people relied increasingly on their traditional customs and practices.This second edition of The Gebusi vividly portrays both the traditions and the modern challenges of Gebusi society and culture with updated content throughout and surprising new conclusions based on the author's return to the Gebusi in 2008.",

This autobiographical account chronicles the remarkable odyssey of Harriet Jacobs (1813\u20131897) whose dauntless spirit and faith carried her from a life of servitude and degradation in North Carolina to liberty and reunion with her children in the North.Written and published in 1861 after Jacobs' harrowing escape from a vile and predatory master, the memoir delivers a powerful and unflinching portrayal of the abuses and hypocrisy of the master-slave relationship. Jacobs writes frankly of the horrors she suffered as a slave, her eventual escape after several unsuccessful attempts, and her seven years in self-imposed exile, hiding in a coffin-like \"garret\" attached to her grandmother's porch.A rare firsthand account of a courageous woman's determination and endurance, this inspirational story also represents a valuable historical record of the continuing battle for freedom and the preservation of family.",

Bush\u2019s 2006 speech explaining the CIA\u2019s interrogation program and why Congress should authorize it. Few know more about these CIA operations than Thiessen, and in his new book, Courting Disaster, he documents just how effective the CIA\u2019s interrogations were in foiling attacks on America, penetrating al-Qaeda\u2019s high command, and providing our military with actionable intelligence. Thiessen also shows how reckless President Obama has been in shutting down the CIA\u2019s program and releasing secret documents that have aided our enemies. Courting Disaster proves:How the CIA program thwarted specific deadly attacks against the U.S.Why &#147;enhanced interrogation\u201d was not torture by any reasonable legal or moral standardHow the information gained by &#147;enhanced interrogation\u201d could not have been acquired any other wayHow President Obama\u2019s actions since taking office have left America much more vulnerable to attackIn chilling detail, Thiessen reveals how close the terrorists came to striking again, how intelligence gained from &#147;enhanced interrogation\u201d repeatedly stymied their plots, and how President Obama\u2019s dismantling of this CIA program is inviting disaster for America.",

        "Title": "The Pain Chronicles: Cures, Myths, Mysteries, Prayers, Diaries, Brain Scans, Healing, and the Science of Suffering",
        "Authors": "By Thernstrom, Melanie",
        "Description": "Each of us will know physical pain in our lives, but none of us knows when it will come or how long it will stay. Today as much as 10 percent of the population of the United States suffers from chronic pain. It is more widespread, misdiagnosed, and undertreated than any major disease. While recent research has shown that pain produces pathological changes to the brain and spinal cord, many doctors and patients still labor under misguided cultural notions and outdated scientific dogmas that prevent proper treatment, to devastating effect.In The Pain Chronicles, a singular and deeply humane work, Melanie Thernstrom traces conceptions of pain throughout the ages\u2014from ancient Babylonian pain-banishing spells to modern brain imaging\u2014to reveal the elusive, mysterious nature of pain itself. Interweaving first-person reflections on her own battle with chronic pain, incisive reportage from leading-edge pain clinics and medical research, and insights from a wide range of disciplines\u2014science, history, religion, philosophy, anthropology, literature, and art\u2014Thernstrom shows that when dealing with pain we are neither as advanced as we imagine nor as helpless as we may fear.Both a personal meditation and an intellectual exploration, The Pain Chronicles illuminates and makes sense of the all-too-human experience of pain\u2014and confronts with extraordinary grace and empathy its peculiar traits, its harrowing effects, and its various antidotes.",
