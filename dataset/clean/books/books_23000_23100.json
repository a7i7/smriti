        "Title": "Democracy at Dawn: Notes from Poland and Points East (Eugenia & Hugh M. Stewart '26 Series)",
        "Authors": "By Quinn, Frederick",
        "Description": "From the sweeping changes of democratic reform to the bloody conflict of the Chechen Republic, 1993-95 was a tumultuous and critical time for Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. During that two-year period, Frederick Quinn toured the former Soviet empire as head of the rule of law programs of the Warsaw Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). His primary task was to help the new nations of the region write new constitutions and rebuild their judicial systems. Keenly aware of the uniqueness of the history he was witnessing unfold, Quinn took notes of his experiences. The result is Democracy at Dawn\u2014a personal, firsthand account of hope and nascent political and social freedom in a drab, confused, confusing, and often seemingly hopeless part of the world.         Quinn recounts the difficulties of many of the countries, as governmental and judicial habits and thought patterns held over from communist regimes, lack of equipment and supplies, shortages of food and services, and, in the case of the Chechen Republic, a devastating civil war all conspire against the formation of popular, pluralistic democracies. He also cites frustrating bureaucratic problems, both with the various host governments as well as with the administration of ODIHR. Quinn also recalls in fascinating detail his encounters with the new leaders of the region, such as Georgia's Edouard ... and ... Vaclav Havel.        At the core of this powerful memoir is Quinn's admiration for the many people he encountered, from working men and women to the functionaries at the highest levels of government, who share a desire for democracy and constitutionality\u2014alien concepts that they nevertheless desperately want to realize. And, despite daunting obstacles faced by the former communist-bloc countries, Quinn asserts that the case for democracy may be more hopeful than it might at first appear. Public discussion about new forms of government is widespread; intense media scrutiny has helped keep the ambitions of authoritarian leaders in check; nongovernmental civic organizations are growing; and the international community has taken increased interest in holding the new states to treaty commitments involving human rights, free elections, and the creation of independent judiciaries.        Engaging and informative reading for the general reader interested in the new Eastern Europe, Democracy at Dawn also offers sociologists, historians, and political scientists a valuable inside look at the rise of democracy in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Iron Curtain. It will be of interest as well to judicial scholars concerned with the development of constitutional judicial systems in new democracies.",

On an ill-fated art expedition into the southern Shan state of Burma, eleven Americans leave their Floating Island Resort for a Christmas-morning tour-and disappear. Through twists of fate, curses, and just plain human error, they find themselves deep in the jungle, where they encounter a tribe awaiting the return of the leader and the mythical book of wisdom that will protect them from the ravages and destruction of the Myanmar military regime.  Saving Fish from Drowning seduces the reader with a fagade of Buddhist illusions, magician's tricks, and light comedy, even as the absurd and picaresque spiral into a gripping morality tale about the consequences of intentions-both good and bad-and about the shared responsibility that individuals must accept for the actions of others.  A pious man explained to his followers: \"It is evil to take lives and noble to save them. Each day I pledge to save a hundred lives. I drop my net in the lake and scoop out a hundred fishes. I place the fishes on the bank, where they flop and twirl. 'Don't be scared,' I tell those fishes. 'I am saving you from drowning.' Soon enough, the fishes grow calm and lie still. Yet, sad to say, I am always too late. The fishes expire. And because it is evil to waste anything, I take those dead fishes to market and I sell them for a good price. With the money I receive, I buy more nets so I can save more fishes.\"",

        "Description": "To pray is to know God.\"If God really cared he would answer my prayer.\"  \"I hesitate to ask him anything.\"  \"I can't understand why he continues to ignore my deepest needs.\"  Bingham Hunter recognizes that most believers have these thoughts from time to time.  He encourages us to look at prayer from the standpoint of who God is.The true aim of prayer is intimacy with God.  We pray effectively when we make him the desire of our hearts,  Hunter answers our questoins about prayer by directing us to the nature and attributes of God and to our own lives.  God responds not to our prayers but to who we are--what we think, feel, will and do.  Prayer is communication from the whole person to the Wholeness that is the living God.",

        "Description": "During the Los Angeles riots, hundreds of law-abiding citizens were able to take up arms against lawless mobs to defend themselves, their families, their homes, and their businesses. They did the job police simply could not do. Lives were saved. Robberies were prevented. Homes and businesses were defended and left intact - all thanks to our constitutional right to keep and bear arms.But despite the lessons of the L.A. riots, despite the fact that millions of Americans use firearms every year to prevent violent crime, and despite the clear intent of our Founding Fathers, there are those in America who believe you do not have the right to own a gun.In Guns, Crime, and Freedom, Wayne LaPierre tells the true story.Until now, there has been no single source for Americans - gun owners and those who don't own guns but are still interested in the debate over gun control - to find the available facts surrounding the gun control argument. Guns, Crime, and Freedom has all the facts. It explores the issues of gun control, crime, and the Second Amendment, and provides documented evidence and telling statements about the agenda of those who want to ban guns.LaPierre vigorously challenges the media and their claim that private gun ownership is the cause of the spiraling crime rate that has made American streets and communities unsafe. He explains - with detailed facts - how the freedom guaranteed in our Constitution is called into question when legislation is proposed to ban guns and impose waiting periods and limitations on gun purchases.At a time when crime rates are soaring, when the \"revolving door\" criminal justice system turns convicts loose to murder, rob, and rape again, and when police seem helpless to protect innocent citizens, it is urgent, says Guns, Crime, and Freedom, that our right of self-defense not be put in jeopardy.",

Spenser returns - heading west to the rich man's haven of Potshot, Arizona, a former mining town reborn as a paradise for Los Angeles millionaires looking for a place to escape the pressures of their high-flying lifestyles. Potshot overcame its rough reputation as a rendezvous for old-time mountain men who lived off the land, thanks to a healthy infusion of new blood and even newer money. But when this western idyll is threatened by a local gang - a twenty-first-century posse of desert rats, misfits, drunks, and scavengers - the local police seem powerless. Led by a charismatic individual known only as The Preacher, this motley band of thieves selectively exploits the town, nurturing it as a source of wealth while systematically robbing the residents blind.Enter Spenser, who has been hired by the comely Mary Lou Buckman to investigate the murder of her husband. The Buckmans, a pair of L.A. transplants, moved to Potshot and started a modest outdoor tour service. It is Mary Lou's belief that when her husband refused to pay The Preacher and his men protection money, he was killed. Without any witnesses, Spenser has little to go on, and it's clear the local police chief won't be doing much to help. Calling on his own cadre of tried-and-true cohorts, including Vinnie Morris, Bobby Horse, Chollo, Bernard J. Fortunato, Tedy Sapp, and the redoubtable Hawk, Spenser must find a way to beat the gang at their own dangerous game.",

The authors save their sharpest knives to go for the jugular in their critique of Republican ideologues who are now running--and ruining--our country.Written by two of the most popular political bloggers in America, the book hails the new movement--of the netroots, the grassroots, the unorthodox labor unions, the maverick big donors--that is the antidote to old-school politics as usual. Fueled by advances in technology and a hunger for a more authentic and populist democracy, this broad-based movement is changing the way political campaigns are waged and managed.A must-read book for anyone with an interest in the future of American democracy.",

Hoofbeats clatter on cobblestones, gaslight glimmers through fog, and in the exclusive privacy of elegant drawing rooms, powerful men and women once again live the splendor and shame of that matchless era. With The Twisted Root, Perry holds us rapt with a chilling story of love, betrayal, and consummate evil.As private investigator William Monk listens to young Lucius Stourbridge plead for help in tracking down his runaway fianc\u00e9e, he feels a sense of heavy foreboding. Miriam Gardiner disappeared suddenly from a croquet party at the luxurious Bayswater mansion of her in-laws-to-be, and has not been seen since. But on Hampstead Heath, Monk finds the coach in which Miriam had fled and, nearby, the murdered body of the coachman. There is no trace of Miriam.What strange compulsion could have driven the beautiful widow to abandon the prospect of a loving marriage and financial abundance? Monk's attempt to answer that question proves a challenge, as Miriam Gardiner's fateful flight ends in a packed London courtroom where brilliant barrister Oliver Rathbone wages an uphill battle to absolve her from a charge of murder. And in a race with the hangman, Monk and clever nurse Hester Latterly--themselves now newlyweds--desperately pursue the elusive truth . . . and an unknown killer whose malign brilliance they have scarcely begun to fathom.",

Her once-loving husband is hardly ever home. The supermommies on the playground routinely snub her. Her days are spent carpooling and enduring endless games of Candy Land, and at night, most of her orgasms are of the do-it-yourself variety.  When a fellow mother is murdered, Kate finds that the unsolved mystery is the most exciting thing to happen in Upchurch, Connecticut, since her neighbors broke ground for a guesthouse and cracked their septic tank. Even though the local police chief warns her that crime-fighting's a job best left to the professionals, Kate launches an unofficial investigation -- from 8:45 to 11:30 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, when her kids are in nursery school.  As Kate is drawn deeper into the murdered woman's past, she begins to uncover the secrets and lies behind Upchurch's picket-fence facade -- and considers the choices and compromises all modern women make as they navigate between marriage and independence, small towns and big cities, being a mother and having a life of one's own.",

These purposes will extend far beyond the few years you will spend on earth. You were made to last forever!Self-help books often suggest that you try to discover the meaning and purpose of your life by looking within yourself, but Rick Warren says that is the wrong place to start. You must begin with God, your Creator, and his reasons for creating you. You were made by God and for God, and until you understand that, life will never make sense.This book will help you understand why you are alive and God's amazing plan for you---both here and now, and for eternity. Rick Warren will guide you through a personal 40-day spiritual journey that will transform your answer to life's most important question: What on earth am I here for?  Knowing God's purpose for creating you will reduce your stress, focus your energy, simplify your decisions, give meaning to your life, and, most importantly, prepare you for eternity.The Purpose Driven Life is a blueprint for Christian living in the 21st century---a lifestyle based on God's eternal purposes, not cultural values. Using over 1,200 scriptural quotes and references, it challenges the conventional definitions of worship, fellowship, discipleship, ministry, and evangelism. In the tradition of Oswald Chambers, Rick Warren offers distilled wisdom on the essence of what life is all about. This is a book of hope and challenge that you will read and re-read, and it will be a classic treasured by generations to come.",

Finn is a master illuminator who works not only for the Church but also, in secret, for John Wycliffe of Oxford, who professes the radical idea that the Bible should be translated into English for everyone to read. Finn has another secret as well, one that leads him into danger when he meets Lady Kathryn of Blackingham Manor, a widow struggling to protect her inheritance from the depredations of Church and Crown alike. Finn's alliance with Lady Kathryn will take us to the heart of what Barbara Tuchman once called \"the calamitous fourteenth century.\" Richly detailed and irresistibly compelling, Brenda Rickman Vantrease's The Illuminator is a glorious story of love, art, religion, and treachery at an extraordinary turning point in history.",

        "Title": "The Bishop and the Beggar Girl of St. Germain (A Father Blackie Ryan Mystery)",
        "Authors": "By Greeley, Andrew M.",
        "Description": "A priest has gone missing in Paris, and Bishop Blackie Ryan is sent to the rescue. The missing cleric is not just an ordinary Dominican friar, but the most popular priest in all of France. Popular because in a very short time Frere Jean-Claude - a simple, pious priest of humble origins - has become a television superstar, idolized by the people of France, a traditionally anticlerical country. Loved by everyone except, of course, the French hierarchy, the church, state, and television community.The Archbishop of Paris, familiar with Bishop Blackie's impressive sleuthing skills, asks the Archbishop of Chicago and Blackie's boss, Sean Cardinal Cronin, for help in finding this missing priest. As usual, Cardinal Cronin resolves the matter with a brusque \"See to it, Blackie?'At the door of the church of St-Germain-des-Pres, Blackie meets a young and beautiful woman begging for money. When he hires her as a translator, she turns out to be an excellent Dr. Watson and a brilliant musician as well. She is at his side for the entire investigation. He soon learns that the Church isn't eager to have the young, innocent, and saintly priest returned, nor are the police. Once the public discovers the disappearance of their beloved priest, the miracles start, and nothing scares the Church more than miracles.Undaunted, Blackie - with the help of his beautiful, young, smart sidekick - defies the cynical and uncooperative Paris police, an unbending church, and reluctant witnesses to find the bizarre solution to one of the most fascinating puzzles he has ever encountered.",

Despite heavy resistance or lack of recognition from patriarchal medicine, they are nevertheless making positive changes that will continue and increase. Women&#146;s emphasis on one-to-one work practiced in mutual agreement and participation is very different from mechanized and big-money medicine, and has results and successes far beyond expectations. The emphasis on self-healing returns health care to the consumer, to women&#146;s lives and bodies, for the first time in centuries. The medical system cannot control a movement held in the hands of women, though it may try. Women are taking control again of healing, our daughter-right, for the first time since the matriarchies and the Inquisition.&#148;&#151;from the Introduction",

He passes through life as a spectator.A postcard from a friend causes Allston to return to the journals of a trip he had taken years before, a journey to his mother's birthplace, where he'd sought a link with the past.

Four young people, all seasonal park employees, have disappeared, and two weeks of work by crack search-and-rescue teams have failed to turn up a single clue; investigators are unsure as to whether the four went AWOL for reasons of their own-or died in the park. Needing an out-of-park ranger to work undercover, Anna is detailed to dining-room duty; but after a week of waiting tables, she knows the missing employees are only the first indications of a sickness threatening the park.  Her twenty-something roommates give up their party-girl ways and panic; her new restaurant colleagues regard her with suspicion and fear. But when Anna's life is threatened and her temporary supervisor turns a deaf ear, she follows the scent of evil, taking a solo hike up a snowy trial to the high country, seeking answers. What waits for her is a nightmare of death and greed-and perhaps her final adventure.",

When his mother allowed him the luxury of food, it was nothing more than spoiled scraps that even the dogs refused to eat. The outside world knew nothing of his living nightmare.

What choices can students make, and what can teachers and university leaders do, to improve more students\u2019 experiences and help them achieve the most from their time and money? Most important, how is the increasing diversity on campus\u2014cultural, racial, and religious\u2014affecting education? What can students and faculty do to benefit from differences, and even learn from the inevitable moments of misunderstanding and awkwardness?From his ten years of interviews with Harvard seniors, Richard Light distills encouraging\u2014and surprisingly practical\u2014answers to fundamental questions. How can you choose classes wisely? What\u2019s the best way to study? Why do some professors inspire and others leave you cold? How can you connect what you discover in class to all you\u2019re learning in the rest of life? Light suggests, for instance: studying in pairs or groups can be more productive than studying alone; the first and most important skill to learn is time management; supervised independent research projects and working internships offer the most learning and the greatest challenges; and encounters with students of different religions can be simultaneously the most taxing and most illuminating of all the experiences with a diverse student body.Filled with practical advice, illuminated with stories of real students\u2019 self-doubts, failures, discoveries, and hopes, Making the Most of College is a handbook for academic and personal success.",

        "Title": "Playboys and Killjoys: An Essay on the Theory and Practice of Comedy",
        "Authors": "By Levin, Harry",
        "Description": "Harry Levin is one of the major literary critics in America. This book is a brilliant and original study of the whole world of comedy, concentrating on playwrights through the centuries, from Aristophanes and Plautus in classical times to Bernard Shaw and Bertolt Brecht and their recent successors.Theories about the subject of comedy have abounded, but they have generally been divorced from theatrical practice.  The alternative--discussions of plays and playwrights, without defining or analyzing the problems they have in common--is also unsatisfying.  Moreover, many critics, in trying to make the subject of humor \"respectable\" have treated the subject humorlessly, while others have succumbed to the temptation to be flip.Levin views the comic repertory as a richly variegated but broadly unified whole and provides a synthesis of theory and practice plus a further synthesis of theories heretofore regarded as conflicting.  He isolated two fundamental aspects of comedy: one centers on the ludicrous (irresponsible, irreverent) \"playboy\" whom we laugh with, and the other on the ridiulous (pretentious, forbidding) \"killjoy\", whom we laugh at.  Levin traces the dialectical interplay of these components throughout history and across various cultures and media.  He places strong emphasis on such major dramatists as Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Moli\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre, and William Congreve.  He comments on the nature and theory of comedy as enunciated by such famous figures as George Meredith and Henri Bergson, and includes essays on such related ideas as humor, satire, and games; but the emphasis throughout is on the plays and on the stage, with incidental reference to comedians like Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers.About the Author:Harry Levin is Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature Emeritus at Harvard University.  His many books include The Question of Hamlet and Shakespeare and the Revolution of the Times.",

Her photograph-one of the most unforgettable images of the twentieth century-was seen around the world and helped turn public opinion against the Vietnam War.This book is the story of how that photograph came to be-and the story of what happened to that girl after the camera shutter closed. Award-winning biographer Denise Chong's portrait of Kim Phuc-who eventually defected to Canada and is now a UNESCO spokesperson-is a rare look at the Vietnam War from the Vietnamese point-of-view and one of the only books to describe everyday life in the wake of this war and to probe its lingering effects on all its participants.",

        "Title": "To America: Personal Reflections of an Historian",
        "Authors": "By Ambrose, Stephen E.",
        "Description": "In To America, Stephen E. Ambrose, one of the country's most influential historians, reflects on his long career as an American historian and explains what an historian's job is all about. He celebrates America's spirit, which has carried us so far. He confronts its failures and struggles. As always in his much acclaimed work, Ambrose brings alive the men and women, famous and not, who have peopled our history and made the United States a model for the world.  Taking a few swings at today's political correctness, as well as his own early biases, Ambrose grapples with the country's historic sins of racism, its neglect and ill treatment of Native Americans, and its tragic errors (such as the war in Vietnam, which he ardently opposed on campus, where he was a professor). He reflects on some of the country's early founders who were progressive thinkers while living a contradiction as slaveholders, great men such as Washington and Jefferson. He contemplates the genius of Andrew Jackson's defeat of a vastly superior British force with a ragtag army in the War of 1812. He describes the grueling journey that Lewis and Clark made to open up the country, and the building of the railroad that joined it and produced great riches for a few barons.  Ambrose explains the misunderstood presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, records the country's assumption of world power under the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and extols its heroic victory of World War II. He writes about women's rights and civil rights and immigration, founding museums, and nation- building. He contrasts the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout, Ambrose celebrates the unflappable American spirit.  Most important, Ambrose writes about writing history. \"The last five letters of the word 'history' tell us that it is an account of the past that is about people and what they did, which is what makes it the most fascinating of subjects.\"   To America is an instant classic for all those interested in history, patriotism, and the love of writing.",

        "Description": "Which is the best cookbook for a beginner? Over the years, many beginning cooks have found this cookbook to be their favorite. It assumes no previous cooking knowledge at all, and it takes absolutely nothing for granted. Complete, well-organized, and extremely thorough, this cookbook progresses slowly and clearly so that you know exactly what to do every step of the way.Even before the first recipe appears, there are pages of important information you need to know: a long list of definitions, tables of measurements and equivalents, and commentary on stoves and kitchen tools. The simplest meal is breakfast, so the first recipes are for preparing fresh and stewed fruits, breakfast cereals, coffee and tea, eggs, breakfast meats, and toast. Then the author tells you how to have a complete meal ready on time and all about seasonings.The meat of the book is next: chapters on buying and cooking meats, fish and seafood, poultry and game, vegetables from artichokes to turnips, and how to make basic sauces, soups, cereal products, casseroles, salads and salad dressings, breads and biscuits, desserts (pies, cookies, cake, and more), and some jams and jellies.Most cooks only learn the basics of cooking when it's absolutely necessary \u2014 after a recipe fails because the cook was unclear about what to do. This book teaches you the essentials of cooking at the beginning and gets you started in the right direction. Beginners will find it invaluable, and experienced cooks will learn a few things from it as well \u2014 things they should have learned when they were beginners.",

        "Title": "The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton",
        "Authors": "By Smiley, Jane",
        "Description": "Six years after her Pulitzer Prize-winning best-seller, A Thousand Acres, and three years after her witty, acclaimed, and best-selling novel of academe, Moo, Jane Smiley once again demonstrates her extraordinary range and brilliance.Her new novel, set in the 1850s, speaks to us in a splendidly quirky voice--the strong, wry, no-nonsense voice of Lidie Harkness of Quincy, Illinois, a young woman of courage, good sense, and good heart. It carries us into an America so violently torn apart by the question of slavery that it makes our current political battlegrounds seem a peaceable kingdom. Lidie is hard to scare. She is almost shockingly alive--a tall, plain girl who rides and shoots and speaks her mind, and whose straightforward ways paradoxically amount to a kind of glamour. We see her at twenty, making a good marriage--to Thomas Newton, a steady, sweet-tempered Yankee who passes through her hometown on a dangerous mission. He belongs to a group of rashly brave New England abolitionists who dedicate themselves to settling the Kansas Territory with like-minded folk to ensure its entering the Union as a Free State.Lidie packs up and goes with him. And the novel races alongside them into the Territory, into the maelstrom of \"Bloody Kansas,\" where slaveholding Missourians constantly and viciously clash with Free Staters, where wandering youths kill you as soon as look at you--where Lidie becomes even more fervently abolitionist than her husband as the young couple again and again barely escape entrapment in webs of atrocity on both sides of the great question.And when, suddenly, cold-blooded murder invades her own intimate circle, Lidie doesn't falter. She cuts off her hair, disguises herself as a boy, and rides into Missouri in search of the killers--a woman in a fiercely male world, an abolitionist spy in slave territory. On the run, her life threatened, her wits sharpened, she takes on yet another identity--and, in the very midst of her masquerade, discovers herself.Lidie grows increasingly important to us as we follow her travels and adventures on the feverish eve of the War Between the States. With its crackling portrayal of a totally individual and wonderfully articulate woman, its storytelling drive, and its powerful recapturing of an almost forgotten part of the American story, this is Jane Smiley at her enthralling and enriching best.",
