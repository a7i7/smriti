I put a fresh spin on budget travel, showing you how to see the best for less and how to see it in a more authentic way-the way the locals do.Instead of spending $300 a night for a chain hotel, why not stay at the Wabi-Sabi House on Maui where you can sleep in an enclosed, tranquil treehouse for just $70 a night, or bed down in an oceanfront condo on Kauai for $105 a night?On Oahu, eat a Hawaiian plate lunch at the Rainbow Drive-In for under $4, so you can splurge on dinner. Try Iron Chef champion Seiya Masahara's specialty-Japanese comfort food known as oden, a hotpot of dashi (broth) with long-simmered vegetables-at Hakkei.Let me show you the \"other\" Hawaii-the one only insiders know about. Listen to slack-key guitar jam sessions on Oahu or volunteer to work with the Hawaii Wildlife Fund on Maui to help endangered sea turtles get a healthy start on life. These are only a few of the great ways to get closer to the culture of Hawaii.

Accompanying Via Dolorosa is the 1996 Eric Symes Memorial Lecture, When Shall We Live?, which addresses questions of faith.",

        "Description": "Few spiritual figures have touched as many readers in the past century as Saint Therese of Lisieux, the saint popularly known as the Little Flower. Though she was only twenty-four years old when she died, her writings have had tremendous impact, making her one of the most popular spiritual writers in the twentieth century. Her autobiography, The Story of a Soul, has been a source of priceless inspiration ever since it was written, and has become the great spiritual bestseller of our time. A hundred years after her death in 1897, millions of copies have spread throughout the world and it has been translated into more than fifty languages.The reason for the continued success of her autobiography is, quite simply, that it is unlike any work of devotion and spiritual insight ever written. Once it is read, it cannot be forgotten. Its appeal across cultures and generations has been extensive, moving both peasants and popes, men and women, young and old\u2014people of every kind of intelligence and education succumb to its spell. Yet is not a conventional work of religious devotion; instead, it is in many ways a supernatural book. In the words of Pope Pius XI, Saint Therese \"attained the knowledge of supernatural things in such abundant measure that\u00a0she was able to point out the sure way of salvation to others,\" and it is especially in The Story of\u00a0a Soul that she has pointed out this sure way to the generations that have followed her. As Therese herself said of this book just prior to her death, \"What I have written will do a lot of good. It will make the kindness of God better known.\"",

Despite the treacherous conditions, Walt and his group, including deputy Tommy Brandon and Walt's best friend, Mark Aker, set off on skis, accompanied by highly trained search dogs. Within minutes, something goes horribly wrong: a shot rings out, and one of their team is dead. By morning, Mark Aker has disappeared.Torn between professional responsibility and the desperate urge to find his friend, Walt is further challenged by an unexplained illness at a local water-bottling plant that sends workers to the hospital and sets off biohazard warnings. Following threads of questionable evidence through the glitter of Sun Valley leads Walt to an unlikely - and darker - source, and reveals a crime played out on a much larger scale than he originally envisioned. Waist-deep in snow and knee-deep in lies, the life of his friend in the balance, Walt begins to suspect that the whole operation is controlled by people of great wealth and power, which leaves him where he started: out in the cold.",

Not only do kids want fun foods such as Squeeze and Scribble Pancakes, Caramel Corn Commotion, Flying Saucer Chicken Quesadillas, Whatever Pizza and Dalmatian Cupcakes-they want to have fun reading the recipes.

In addition to the fifty terrific recipes, there are great party ideas complete with tempting treats. Try indoor camping or a spooky Halloween party-everything you'll need is right here. And, formatted in a sturdy, concealed spiral binding, this book takes it lying down-on the counter, on the table-wherever it's easiest for busy cooks. If your kids are ready to go wild in the kitchen, take Betty Crocker along! The results will be fantastic, and your kids will have a blast.

        "Title": "Bridging the Class Divide: And Other Lessons for Grassroots Organizing",
        "Authors": "By Stout, Linda",
        "Description": "Again and again social change movements--on matter s from the environment to women's rights--have been run by middle-class leaders. But in order to make real progress toward economic and social change, poor people--those most affected by social problems--must be the ones to speak up and lead.It can be done. Linda Stout herself grew up in poverty in rural North Carolina and went on to found one of this country's most successful and innovative grassroots organizations, the Piedmont Peace Project. Working for peace, jobs, health care, and basic social services in North Carolina's conservative Piedmont region, the project has attracted national attention for its success in drawing leadership from within a working-class community, actively encouraging diversity, and empowering people who have never had a voice in policy decisions to speak up for their own interests. The Piedmont Peace Project demonstrates that new ways of organizing can really work.Bridging the Class Divide tells the inspiring story of Linda Stout's life as the daughter of a tenant farmer, as a self-taught activist, and as a leader in the progressive movement. It also gives practical lessons on how to build real working relationships between people of different income levels, races, and genders. This book will inspire and enrich anyone who works for change in our society.",

        "Title": "The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream",
        "Authors": "By Obama, Barack",
        "Description": "In July 2004, Barack Obama electrified the Democratic National Convention with an address that spoke to Americans across the political spectrum. One phrase in particular anchored itself in listeners\u2019 minds, a reminder that for all the discord and struggle to be found in our history as a nation, we have always been guided by a dogged optimism in the future, or what Obama called \u201cthe audacity of hope.\u201d The Audacity of Hope is Barack Obama\u2019s call for a different brand of politics\u2014a politics for those weary of bitter partisanship and alienated by the \u201cendless clash of armies\u201d we see in congress and on the campaign trail; a politics rooted in the faith, inclusiveness, and nobility of spirit at the heart of \u201cour improbable experiment in democracy.\u201d He explores those forces\u2014from the fear of losing to the perpetual need to raise money to the power of the media\u2014that can stifle even the best-intentioned politician. He also writes, with surprising intimacy and self-deprecating humor, about settling in as a senator, seeking to balance the demands of public service and family life, and his own deepening religious commitment.At the heart of this book is Barack Obama\u2019s vision of how we can move beyond our divisions to tackle concrete problems. He examines the growing economic insecurity of American families, the racial and religious tensions within the body politic, and the transnational threats\u2014from terrorism to pandemic\u2014that gather beyond our shores. And he grapples with the role that faith plays in a democracy\u2014where it is vital and where it must never intrude. Underlying his stories about family, friends, and members of the Senate is a vigorous search for connection: the foundation for a radically hopeful political consensus. A public servant and a lawyer, a professor and a father, a Christian and a skeptic, and above all a student of history and human nature, Barack Obama has written a book of transforming power. Only by returning to the principles that gave birth to our Constitution, he says, can Americans repair a political process that is broken, and restore to working order a government that has fallen dangerously out of touch with millions of ordinary Americans. Those Americans are out there, he writes\u2014\u201cwaiting for Republicans and Democrats to catch up with them.\u201d",

        "Description": "Poker is America\u2019s national card game, and its popularity continues to grow. Nationwide, you can find a game in progress everywhere. If you want to play, you can find poker games on replicas of 19th century riverboats or on Native American tribal lands. You can play poker at home with the family or online with opponents from around the world. Like bowling and billiards before it, poker has moved out from under the seedier side of its roots and is flowering in the sunshine.  Maybe you\u2019ve never played poker before and you don\u2019t even know what a full house is. Poker For Dummies covers the basics. Or perhaps you've played for years, but you just don\u2019t know how to win. This handy guide will help you walk away from the poker table with winnings, not lint, in your pockets. If you\u2019re a poker expert, you still can benefit\u00a0\u2013\u00a0some of the suggestions may surprise you, and you can certainly learn from the anecdotes from professional players like T.J. Cloutier and Stu Unger. Know what it takes to start winning hand after hand by exploring strategy; getting to know antes and betting structure; knowing your opponents, and understanding the odds. Poker For Dummies also covers the following topics and more:  Poker games such as Seven-Card Stud, Omaha, and Texas Hold'em Setting up a game at home Playing in a casino: Do's and don'ts Improving your play with Internet and video poker Deciphering poker sayings and slang Ten ways to read your opponent's body language Playing in poker tournaments Money management and recordkeeping Knowing when and how to bluff  Poker looks like such a simple game. Anyone, it seems, can play it well\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but that's far from the truth. Learning the rules can be quick work, but becoming a winning player takes considerably longer. Still, anyone willing to make the effort can become a good player. You can succeed in poker the way you succeed in life: by facing it squarely, getting up earlier than the next person, and working harder and smarter than the competition.

        "Authors": "By Brown, Lester R.",
        "Description": "In 1543, Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus challenged the view that the Sun revolved around the Earth, arguing instead that the Earth revolved around the Sun. His paper led to a revolution in thinking\u2014to a new worldview. Eco-Economy discusses the need today for a similar shift in our worldview. The issue now is whether the environment is part of the economy or the economy is part of the environment. Lester R. Brown argues the latter, pointing out that treating the environment as part of the economy has produced an economy that is destroying its natural support systems. Brown notes that if China were to have a car in every garage, American style, it would need 80 million barrels of oil a day\u2014more than the world currently produces. If paper consumption per person in China were to reach the U.S. level, China would need more paper than the world produces. There go the world's forests. If the fossil fuel-based, automobile-centered, throwaway economic model will not work for China, it will not work for the other 3 billion people in the developing world\u2014and it will not work for the rest of the world. But Brown is optimistic as he describes how to restructure the global economy to make it compatible with the Earth's ecosystem so that economic progress can continue. In the new economy, wind farms replace coal mines, hydrogen-powered fuel cells replace internal combustion engines, and cities are designed for people, not cars. Glimpses of the new economy can be seen in the wind farms of Denmark, the solar rooftops of Japan, and the bicycle network of the Netherlands. Eco-Economy is a road map of how to get from here to there.",

Much of this money is wasted because the preliminary analysis and diagnosis has not been done to link these programs to an organization&apos;s real business needs, goals, and processes. The truth is that in order for any performance improvement effort to add value to the organization, deep analysis is required. Analysis for Improving Performance details a systematic approach for doing the rigorous preparatory analysis that is vital to shaping and developing successful performance improvement efforts.  Richard A. Swanson&apos;s methods enable program developers and managers to define clear objectives, assess existing systems and missions, analyze worker knowledge and expertise, define desired performance and evaluation standards, and develop a performance improvement plan that will meet the desired performance goals. This new edition has been extensively revised throughout and presents expanded concepts and updated cases, as well as a new chapter on documenting and improving work processes and documenting process-referenced tasks. Written for take-charge managers, performance improvement specialists, and workers wanting to improve their organizations, Analysis for Improving Performance provides \u201creal-world\u201d knowledge, tools, examples, graphics, and exercises aimed at developing your expertise in diagnosing organizational performance and documenting workplace expertise\u2014the keys to long-term organizational success.

Then a trapper found a chunk of gold, and everything  changed overnight.In six days a town called Confusion appeared . . . and on the  seventh it could disappear, consumed by the flames of lawlessness and violence. On  one side are those who understand only brute force. On the other are men who want  law and order but are ready to use a noose to achieve their ends. Between them stand  Matt Coburn and Dick Felton: one a hardened realist, the other an idealist trying  to dig a fortune from the muddy hillside. Outnumbered and outgunned, Felton and Coburn  can\u2019t afford to be outmaneuvered. For as the two unlikely allies confront corruption,  betrayal, and murder in an attempt to tame a town where the discovery of gold can  mean either the fortune of a lifetime or a sentence of death, they realize that any  move could be their last.",

        "Title": "Blocking the Courthouse Door: How the Republican Party and Its Corporate Allies Are Taking Away Your Right to Sue",
        "Authors": "By Mencimer, Stephanie",
        "Description": "Thanks to constant political oratory against \"frivolous lawsuits\" and \"jackpot justice,\" it is widely known that there's a legal crisis in this country. President Bush never misses an opportunity to call for laws that would bring more \"common sense\" to a legal system that, he claims, is out of control, wrecking the economy, driving doctors out of their practices, bankrupting small businesses, and costing American jobs. Journalists repeat the charges without examining them.   As a result, the lawsuit issue has moved to the political front burner, and in the past three years, state after state has responded by limiting citizens' rights to sue. Just this year alone, the Republicanled Congress has passed restrictions on class action lawsuits and is steps away from enacting limits on medical malpractice lawsuits.   But is there really a crisis? National data show that the number of civil suits is falling, not rising, and that the average damage award is also going down. Despite intense media hype to the contrary, the number of personal injury lawsuits filed every year has been tumbling for the past decade. Upon closer examination, the stories of ridiculous lawsuits usually turn out to be false or badly misleading. The crisis, in short, appears to be a phantom.   So how do we explain the scary headlines? Who's behind the \"tort reform movement,\" and what are the real goals? Blocking the Courthouse Door will show that the movement against so-called greedy trial lawyers and irresponsible plaintiffs is the result of a concerted and successful campaign by large corporations to get this issue on the table and thus limit their own vulnerability in the civil justice system. They have spent decades, and many millions of dollars, on focus groups and Madison Avenue public relations research. They have funded institutes, sponsored academic research, bankrolled politicians, set up phony \"astroturf \" grassroots organizations (with chamber of commerce return addresses), and fed copy to all-too-gullible journalists.   For corporations, the self-interest involved is fairly plain. Tobacco companies, no longer able to dodge the bullet of liability for knowingly selling poisons, are making an end run around the civil justice system. If they can't win a class action suit, they'll make suing itself illegal. Insurance companies, drowning in red ink from mismanagement and bad investments in the bond market, hike insurance rates by huge sums and blame malpractice suits. The doctors in turn blame greedy lawyers -- and their own injured patients. And for Republicans, the campaign provides an extra bonus: defunding the Democratic Party. Limits on lawsuits cut into the income of some of the Democratic Party's most generous donors, the trial lawyers, who are often the only source of campaign cash for Democrats in many states.   By exposing some of the dubious characters, corporate chicanery, skewed research, fudged numbers, and bogus journalism that have buttressed the calls for lawsuit reform,Stephanie Mencimer shows who's behind the movement to close the courthouse doors, and how they've successfully persuaded millions of Americans to give up their critical legal rights without fully understanding what they're losing -- often until it's too late.",
