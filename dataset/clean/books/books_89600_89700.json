It is hard to disagree. Even though he wrote his only major work at a time when the range of firearms was fifty yards, much of what he had to say continued to be relevant to the conduct of war throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and is likely to remain so in the twenty-first. Michael Howard explains Clausewitz's ideas in terms both of his experiences as a professional soldier in the Napoleonic Wars, and of the intellectual background of his time.",

Luckily, Abby's mama located a psychic in the yellow pages -- a certain Madame Woo-Woo -- and, together with a motley group of feisty retirees known as the \"Heavenly Hustlers,\" they all get down to give an unwanted spook the heave-ho. But, for all her extrasensory abilities, the Madame didn't foresee that she, herself, would be forced over to the other side prematurely. Suddenly Abby fears there's more than a specter haunting C.J. And they\u2019d better exorcise a flesh-and-blood killer fast before the recently departed Woo-Woo gets company.",

Her first inspirational series, Brides of Culdee Creek, has proven successful as well. Woman of Grace and Lady of Light each climbed the CBA Marketplace best-selling fiction list. This new release, Child of Promise, is the final book in the series.  Beth MacKay, the daughter of Culdee Creek's owner, returns home after completing medical school to take over the aging Doc Childress's practice. Reluctantly,  her life and heart become entwined with that of Grand View's Episcopalian priest, Noah Starr. But Noah struggles with his faith and calling since his wife died and his daughter, Emily, was disabled with cerebral palsy due to the difficult birth.    When Beth becomes embroiled in a spousal abuse case between two of Noah's parishioners, she encourages the battered woman to leave her husband for her own safety.  Noah cautions the woman to try to work things out, and when the abuse ends in tragedy, it's the last straw for the already-doubtful priest. Despondent and shaken, he announces his resignation to the church. Only with Beth's faith and love, and a little help from the community, can Noah find his way back to the life and calling God has always intended for him.",

        "Title": "Treating Alcohol Problems: Marital and Family Interventions",
        "Authors": "By O'Farrell, Timothy J. (EDT)",
        "Description": "Both research and clinical findings indicate a significant reciprocal relationship between marital-family interactions and abusive drinking: Chronic problem drinking is often a component in marital and familial discord; and, conversely, positive marital and family adjustment is clearly associated with better alcohol treatment outcomes. An ideal resource, this volume is a practical guide to the most up-to-date marital and family therapy practices that have been shown to be effective in treating alcohol problems.Chapters by leading clinician-researchers present practical \"how to\" information on research-tested methods for use at different stages of the alcoholism recovery process. Each chapter includes an overview of the specific method under consideration and detailed guidelines for implementation. Special clinical considerations are discussed, and a summary of current knowledge regarding efficacy as well as an extensive reference list are included. Illustrative case examples are provided throughout.Part I describes strategies for initiating change and helping the family when the alcoholic is unwilling to seek help on his own. Chapters cover unilateral family therapy, community reinforcement training for families, the Johnson Institute intervention approach, and a group program designed to help the wives of treatment-resistant alcoholics decrease their own emotional distress and examine their options.Chapters in Part II present methods drawn from a variety of theoretical approaches for stabilizing sobriety when the alcoholic has sought help in both inpatient and outpatient treatment centers. Approaches discussed include an eclectic approach to family treatment in short-term detoxification, the Hazelden residential family program, a behavioral marital therapy couples group program, an alcohol-focused spouse involvement with behavioral marital therapy, systemic couples therapy for alcohol-abusing women, and family therapy for adolescent alcohol abuse.Strategies for maintaining long-term recovery and preventing relapse, including behavioral contracts between alcoholics and family members, couples relapse prevention sessions, and an outpatient couples therapy program based on Marlatt and Gordon's model of the relapse process, are described in Part III. Finally, ways to deal with alcohol problems encountered by practitioners outside the alcoholism treatment setting and directions for future research are explored in Part IV.Timely and relevant, Treating Alcohol Problems is designed for clinical psychologists, marital and family therapists, counselors, and social workers working with alcohol problems. Perfect as a teaching text, this book provides carefully developed, well-conceived marital and family therapy methods that have been shown to be effective with this difficult clinical problem.",

Hard work, aptitude, and sheer determination have helped her rise from adverse circumstances to an internship in one of the nation\u2019s most competitive surgical residencies. But talent and tenacity mean nothing in the face of the discovery that is about to rock her world. It\u2019s called the \"Stoney Creek Curse\" by folks in the small mountain town where Claire grew up. Behind the superstition lies a reality that could destroy her career. But getting to the truth is far from easy in a community with secrets to hide. As a web of relationships becomes increasingly tangled, two things become apparent. One is that more than one person doesn\u2019t want Claire to probe too deeply into the \"Stoney Creek Curse.\" The other is that someone has reasons other than the curse for wanting Claire out of the picture permanently. Somewhere in the course of pursuing her career as a surgeon, Claire lost touch with the God who called her to it. Now she realizes how desperately she needs him. But can she reclaim a faith strong enough to see her through this deadly dance of circumstances?",

In The Hampton Affair, Vincent Lardo's debut novel, these three worlds collide in a power struggle over land, family secrets, and the almighty dollar.The Hampton Affair is told in three voices: those of Michael Anthony Ren, very south-of-the-highway, thanks to the age-old skill of marrying well; Galen Miller, very north-of-the-highway, a descendant of original East End farmers, and detective Eddy Ivans, very much in the middle, literally and figuratively. Michael is desperately trying to save his marriage, which is tied to his wife's fortune. Galen is desperately trying to save his stake in the family farm, suddenly worth a cool million, from the clutches of his conniving stepmother, who also happens to be his mistress. And in this version of North and South, Eddy has to solve the mystery of who did what to whom - and why - while trying to win the affections of the one young lady in town who appears to have all the answers. Only she's not talking.",

        "Authors": "By Carmindy",
        "Description": "According to a recent study, only 2% of women describe themselves as 'beautiful.' (Dove Global Study 'The Real Truth About Beauty: A Global Report', 2004) The media instructs women how to 'look ten years younger,' 'cover up wrinkles,' or 'get fuller, plumper lips.' And even makeup products play off womens' insecurities, promising to conceal perceived flaws, define cheekbones, or make eyelashes fuller and longer. The underlying message? That there's something inherently wrong with the way women look and that they have to spend time, money, and energy keeping up with all the ways they should 'fix' themselves. In GET POSITIVELY BEAUTIFUL, makeup artist Carmindy from TLC's hit program What Not to Wear shows you how to change your mindset from negative fault-finding to a positive beauty philosphy. You learn how to find and focus on your best features and how to combat negative thoughts about your appearance. Carmindy demonstrates easy makeup techniques for eyes, brows, lashes, lips, cheeks, and skin, and how to adapt looks to different weather conditions and 'beauty moods.'",

        "Description": "Flying a beautiful kite is exhilarating and all the more thrilling and rewarding when the kite soaring in the sunshine is your own creation!This exciting practical guide helps even new kite makers to experience the adventure of constructing and flying nine original kites based on traditional designs from around the world. Step-by-step instructions and detailed diagrams take you through the process of assembling, testing, decorating, and flying each of the kites. Finished kites must be aerodynamically sound, but the authors allow plenty of leeway in construction: \"In kite making, precise measurements are less important than balance, proportion, and symmetry.\" And although materials are specified for each design, the easy-to-follow directions allow for a variety of lightweight, durable substitutions.Beginners and children will want to start with the simple, universally familiar European Diamond Kite. But neither the intricate, unusually shaped Oriental kite nor the scientifically sophisticated, efficient High-Tech Box Kite is very hard to make. The spectacular Guatemalan Sun Kite is a high flier that sings as it soars, the result of four easy-to-make \"buzzers\" that vibrate in the wind. Designed to be flown at night and illuminated with flashlights, the intriguing New England Ghost Kite is an excellent \"swooper.\" Each design has a unique flying style: the Chinese Yuan flies well in a light-to-moderate wind while the High-Tech Box requires a good stiff breeze; the Chinese Dragonfly and Oriental Butterfly are low, steady fliers, and the Guatemalan Sun and Korean Warrior are showy high fliers. All are magnificent examples of a 2,000-year history of kite flying.",
