Seventeen-year-old Katie Byrne stands shivering in the cold Connecticut woods, her flashlight illuminating a scene out of a nightmare. Carly, one of her two closest friends, lies beaten and unconscious, her face covered in blood. Moments later, the horror escalates when Katie's brother discovers the lifeless body of Denise, the third member of their inseparable trio. Nearby is the old barn where only hours before the three girls joyfully rehearsed Shakespearean speeches for an upcoming school performance. For Katie, who returned to the makeshift theatre to retrieve schoolbooks she had forgotten in her haste to get home early, the tragedy marks the end of a long-shared dream. The girls began acting together as ten-year olds with stars in their eyes, fantasizing about the day they would all move to New York and take Broadway by storm. Now, only Katie can realize the dream. Ten years later, Katie, a tall, lanky beauty with reddish-gold hair, is a struggling actress in New York. Haunted by the memory of Denise's death and by thoughts of Carly, who still lies in a coma, she longs for the fame and celebrity they imagined together so long before. After an acclaimed performance Katie finally wins a starring role on Broadway and begins a promising love affair. But before she can step into the spotlight, Katie must escape the dark shadows of the past. In sixteen previous bestselling novels, Barbara Taylor Bradford has enthralled millions of readers with page-turning plots and characters that linger in the heart and mind long after the book is closed. In The Triumph of Katie Byrne, romance, the theatre, and murder and mystery from the past all collide in a tale that will keep readers spellbound until the very last page.",

        "Description": "Comeback Cities shows how innovative, pragmatic tactics for ameliorating the nation\u2019s urban ills have produced results beyond anyone\u2019s expectations, reawakening America\u2019s toughest neighborhoods. In the past, big government and business working separately were unable to solve the inner city crisis. Rather, a blend of public-private partnerships, grassroots nonprofit organizations, and a willingness to experiment characterize what is best among the new approaches to urban problem solving. Pragmatism, not dogma, has produced the charter school movement and the police\u2019s new focus on \u201cquality-of-life\u201d issues. The new breed of big city mayors has welcomed business back into the city, stressed performance and results at city agencies, downplayed divisive racial politics, and cracked down on symptoms of social disorder. As a consequence, America\u2019s inner cities are becoming vital communities once again.There is much yet to be done, but Grogan and Proscio base their optimism on a number of trends that could dramatically multiply the impact of the grassroots community development industry. The authors point to unprecedented access to capital and credit, astonishing reductions in violent crime, and substantial overhauls of public housing, welfare, and public schools already underway as harbingers of an inner-city revival. Through a mixture of analysis and storytelling, Grogan and Proscio argue convincingly that the conditions are ripe - the infrastructure is in place - to turn a source of national shame into a source of national pride.",

        "Title": "Temple of Liberty: Building the (United States) Capitol for a New Nation",
        "Authors": "By Scott, Pamela",
        "Description": "Throughout its history, the consciousness of Washington D.C.'s national and international importance has guided the layout of its public spaces and the design of its public buildings. For George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, the Founding Figures most responsible for overseeing the initial design and direction of the Capitol, America's principle legislative building should be a unique architectural expression of the country's new political system. However, creating a structure of such significance presented numerous pragmatic and political difficulties, as well as changing symbolic intensions, as Revolutionary-era iconography gave way to that expressive of national expansion.    In Temple of Liberty, Pamela Scott presents an in-depth exploration of the first United States Capitol begun in 1793 but not completed until 1916 with the placement of sculpture in the House wing's pediment. This fascinating work is an accompaniment to the \"Temple of Liberty\" exhibition scheduled to be held at the Madison Gallery of the Library of Congress in the Spring of 1995--an exhibition of original prints, drawings, and documents that depict a young nation building its first and most significant architectural symbol. Together, the book and exhibition will offer a new understanding of the role of this important building in the history of American architecture and evolution of our government.    Explaining the origins and meaning of several symbols proposed during the late eighteenth century, such as the snake and eagle, and allegorical figures of Hercules, Minerva, and Mercury, Scott shows how they were used to create a composite American iconography derived from European and American elements to portray such concepts as national unity, liberty, and plenty. She focuses on the Capitol's protracted design competition process which featured both open and invitational competitions that began in early 1792 and continued through mid-1793. In turn, she reviews the entries of the various contestants (as well as their interaction with Washington and Jefferson, the competition judges), including the amateur architect and physician William Thornton, whose submission was eventually chosen as the winning plan for the Capitol, and Stephen Sulpice Hallet, a professional architect who took second place and was hired to build Thornton's design. Scott discusses the actual construction of the Capitol, from the development of its facade and grounds, based on a modified version of Thornton's original plan, through the building's completion nearly four decades later. She goes on to detail the growth of the magnificent interior spaces, from the Senate and House wings, to the center building that contained the crypt, rotunda, and Library of Congress. We see how two of America's foremost architects, Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Charles Bulfinch, emerged as the primary form givers, despite the fact that their definitions of how to express American national identity through architecture, differed considerably. Throughout, she focuses on the effort to create uniquely American architectural elements, from a fiesty American bald eagle instead of the classical Roman eagle, to columns featuring tobacco and corn motifs. Finally, Scott illustrates how the Capitol was extended in the 1850s and 1860s into the structure that exists today which dwarfs the original building--two new wings and a much higher dome--and the efforts made to continue the symbolic themes of the first Capitol in the architectural, painted, and sculpted programs of the project.    From the first Capitol's chaste Neoclassicism to its vibrant Victorian additions, the intention was that it express in its architecture and decoration our national political, social, and cultural ideals. Entertaining and informative, Temple of Liberty explores these concerns and the manner in which they were achieved, showing how quickly and widely the Capitol became a premier symbol in America's popular consciousness.",

        "Description": "In Mozart\u2019s Brain and the Fighter Pilot, eminent neuropsychiatrist and bestselling author Richard Restak, M.D., combines the latest research in neurology and psychology to show us how to get our brain up to speed for managing every aspect of our busy lives. Everything we think and everything we choose to do alters our brain and fundamentally changes who we are, a process that continues until the end of our lives. Few people think of the brain as being susceptible to change in its actual structure, but in fact we can preselect the kind of brain we will have by continually exposing ourselves to rich and varied life experiences. Unlike other organs that eventually wear out with repeated and sustained use, the brain actually improves the more we challenge it. Most of us incorporate some kind of physical exercise into our daily lives. We do this to improve our bodies and health and generally make us feel better. Why not do the same for the brain?  The more we exercise it, the better it performs and the better we feel. Think of Restak as a personal trainer for your brain\u2014he will help you assess your mental strengths and weaknesses, and his entertaining book will set you to thinking about the world and the people around you in a new light, providing you with improved and varied skills and capabilities. From interacting with colleagues to recognizing your own psychological makeup, from understanding the way you see something to why you\u2019re looking at it in the first place, from explaining the cause of panic attacks to warding off performance anxiety, this book will tell you the whys and hows of the brain\u2019s workings. Packed with practical advice and fascinating examples drawn from history, literature, and science, Mozart\u2019s Brain and the Fighter Pilot provides twenty-eight informative and realistic steps that we can all take to improve our brainpower.",

Similarly, hardware designers must understand the far reaching effects their design decisions have on software applications. For readers in either category, this classic introduction to the field provides a deep look into the computer. It demonstrates the relationship between the software and hardware and focuses on the foundational concepts that are the basis for current computer design.  Using a distinctive \"learning by evolution\" approach the authors present each idea from its first principles, guiding readers through a series of worked examples that incrementally add more complex instructions until they have acquired an understanding of the entire MIPS instruction set and  the fundamentals of assembly language. Computer arithmetic, pipelining, and memory hierarchies are treated to the same evolutionary approach with worked examples and incremental drawings supporting each new level of sophistication. The design, performance, and significance of I/O systems is also discussed in depth, and an entire chapter is devoted to the emerging architectures of multiprocessor systems.",

        "Authors": "By Flickenger, Rob",
        "Description": "A competent system administrator knows that a Linux server is a high performance system for routing large amounts of information through a network connection.  Setting up and maintaining a Linux server requires understanding not only the hardware, but the ins and outs of the Linux operating system along with its supporting cast of utilities as well as layers of applications software.  There's basic documentation online but there's a lot beyond the basics you have to know, and this only comes from people with hands-on, real-world experience.  This kind of  \"know how\" is what we sought to capture in Linux Server Hacks.Linux Server Hacks is a collection of 100 industrial-strength hacks, providing tips and tools that solve practical problems for Linux system administrators.  Every hack can be read in just a few minutes but will save hours of searching for the right answer. Some of the hacks are subtle, many of them are non-obvious, and all of them demonstrate the power and flexibility of a Linux system.   You'll find hacks devoted to tuning the Linux kernel to make your system run more efficiently, as well as using CVS or RCS to track the revision to system files. You'll learn alternative ways to do backups, how to use system monitoring tools to track system performance and a variety of secure networking solutions. Linux Server Hacks also helps you manage large-scale Web installations running Apache, MySQL, and other open source tools that are typically part of a Linux system.O'Reilly's new Hacks Series proudly reclaims the term \"hacking\" for the good guys. Hackers use their ingenuity to solve interesting problems.  Rob Flickenger is an experienced system administrator, having managed the systems for O'Reilly Network for several years.  (He's also into community wireless networking and he's written a book on that subject for O'Reilly.) Rob has also collected the best ideas and tools from a number of other highly skilled contributors.Written for users who already understand the basics, Linux Server Hacks is built upon the expertise of people who really know what they're doing.",

        "Title": "Dantes' Inferno: A Dr. Sylvia Strange Novel (Dr. Sylvia Strange Novels)",
        "Authors": "By Lovett, Sarah",
        "Description": "The author of the critically acclaimed novels Dangerous Attachments and Acquired Motives is back with another spellbindingly original thriller featuring forensic psychiatrist Sylvia Strange. Now, in Dantes' Inferno, Sylvia is called to Los Angeles from her New Mexico home when a massive explosion blasts through the J. Paul Getty Museum, endangering children on a field trip and claiming two lives. The police peg notorious bomber John Dantes as the mastermind, even though he's in a maximum-security prison, serving a life sentence for another bombing he claims he didn't commit. Dr. Strange, a genius at accessing the most tortured psychiatric cases, is called in to evaluate Dantes. The prisoner is said to be unreachable -- and renowned for psychologically terrorizing his every visitor. But Dr. Strange forms a sudden, and unsettling, connection with Dantes. There's something about the enigmatic loner and his obsession with Los Angeles that both confounds and unnerves her. She's not at all convinced he's the man behind the bombs now ripping through the city -- but she is convinced he holds the key to finding the real bomber. The problem remains: how to get at Dantes? The police department's drug-and-interrogation campaign effectively stupefies the patient, and Dr. Strange's inability to \"get results\" troubles her deeply pragmatic supervisor, who in turn challenges her approach, her ability, and her intuition. As the death toll rises, so does public outcry, and sanctions against the fully demonized prisoner are further tightened. With the clock ticking on a bomb promised to be of epic proportions, Dr. Strange's sovereignty over her patient is slipping away -- along with, seemingly, her sanity. Dantes' Inferno is a hypnotic, heart-pounding journey to the soul of madness that reveals disturbing and darkly universal truths about human nature. It is Sarah Lovett's best thriller yet.",

        "Description": "The story of four boys growing up in the Edinburgh projects, Glue is about the loyalties, the experiences, and the secrets that hold friends together through three decades. The boys become men: Juice Terry, the work-shy fanny-merchant, with corkscrew curls and sticky fingers; Billy the boxer, driven, controlled, playing to his strengths; Carl, the Milky Bar Kid, drifting along to his own soundtrack; and the doomed Gally, exceedingly thin-skinned and vulnerable to catastrophe at every turn. We follow their lives from the seventies into the new century\u2014from punk to techno, from speed to E. Their mutual loyalty is fused in street morality: Back up your mates, don't hit women, and, most important, never snitch\u2014on anyone. Glue has the Irvine Welsh trademarks\u2014crackling dialogue, scabrous set pieces, and black, black humor\u2014but it is also a grown-up book about growing up\u2014about the way we live our lives, and what happens to us when things become unstuck. \"Stocked with his usual quirky, sympathetic characters, this rollicking new tale sparkles with the writer's trademark satiric wit. Its heft and narrative breadth should convince any remaining skeptics that Welsh\u2014now effectively the grand old man of in-your-face Scottish fiction\u2014is a writer to be taken seriously.\"\u2014Publishers Weekly starred review",

Robert McChesney, whom Marc Crispin Miller calls \u201cthe greatest of our media historians,\u201d maintains that the major beneficiaries of the so-called Information Age are no more than a handful of enormous corporations, and that this concentrated corporate control  is disastrous for any notion of participatory democracy.In a book that Noam Chomsky hails as a \u201crich, penetrating study,\u201d McChesney combines historical sweep and unprecedented detail on current events as he chronicles the recent waves of media mergers and acquisitions, as well as the corrupt and secretive enactment of public policies surrounding the Internet, digital television, and public broadcasting. He also addresses the gradual and ominous adaptation of the First Amendment as a means of shielding corporate media power, and debunks the myth that the market compels media firms to \u201cgive the people what they want.\u201d",

But which one of them suddenly took action, and will that person murder again to preserve a deadly secret?Death and the Oxford Box introduces an appealing sleuth in a dynamic new series from one of England's most talented young writers.",

He also explores the thorny patch of moral and ethical questions posed by emerging biological explanations for mental illness. With uncommon humanity, candor, wit, and erudition, award-winning author Solomon takes readers on a journey of incom-parable range and resonance into the most pervasive of family secrets.

Each story features full-color illustrations by artists including Barry Blitt, Lane Smith, David Heatley, and Marcel Dzama.The collection includes previously unpublished children's stories from Jonathan Safran Foer (Everything is Illuminated), Nick Hornby (High Fidelity), Neil Gaiman (Sandman), George Saunders (CivilWarLand in Bad Decline), Kelly Link (Stranger Than Fiction), and Jon Scieskza (Stinky Cheese Man).

        "Description": "The story of Captain D. Michael Abrashoff and his command of USS Benfold has become legendary inside and outside the Navy. Now Abrashoff offers this fascinating tale of top-down change for anyone trying to navigate today's uncertain business seas. When Captain Abrashoff took over as commander of USS Benfold, a ship armed with every cutting-edge system available, it was like a business that had all the latest technology but only some of the productivity. Knowing that responsibility for improving performance rested with him, he realized he had to improve his own leadership skills before he could improve his ship. Within months he created a crew of confident and inspired problem-solvers eager to take the initiative and take responsibility for their actions. The slogan on board became \"It's your ship,\" and Benfold was soon recognized far and wide as a model of naval efficiency. How did Abrashoff do it? Against the backdrop of today's United States Navy-Benfold was a key player in our Persian Gulf fleet-Abrashoff shares his secrets of successful management including: See the ship through the eyes of the crew: By soliciting a sailor's suggestions, Abrashoff drastically reduced tedious chores that provided little additional value.Communicate, communicate, communicate: The more Abrashoff communicated the plan, the better the crew's performance. His crew would eventually call him \"Megaphone Mike,\" since they heard from him so often.Create discipline by focusing on purpose: Discipline skyrocketed when Abrashoff's crew believed that what they were doing was important.Listen aggressively: After learning that many sailors wanted to use the GI Bill, Abrashoff brought a test official aboard the ship-and held the SATs forty miles off the Iraqi coast. From achieving amazing cost savings to winning the highest gunnery score in the Pacific Fleet, Captain Abrashoff's extraordinary campaign sent shock waves through the U.S. Navy. It can help you change the course of your ship, no matter where your business battles are fought.",

        "Title": "Critical Condition: How Health Care in America Became Big Business--and Bad Medicine",
        "Authors": "By Barlett, Donald L. and Steele, James B.",
        "Description": "Exposing the most controversial, little-known practices of America\u2019s most flawed system, Time magazine\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative team pulls back the curtain on the health care industry to explain exactly how things grew so out of control.Dirty examination and operating rooms in doctor\u2019s offices and hospitals . . . Health care executives pulling in millions in bonuses for denying treatment to the sick . . . More than 100 million people with inadequate or no medical coverage . . . This may sound like the predicament of a third-world nation, but this is America\u2019s health care reality today.  The U.S. spends more on health care than any other nation, yet our benefits are shrinking and life expectancy is shorter here than in countries that spend significantly less per capita.  Meanwhile, HMOs, pharmaceutical companies, and hospital chains reap tremendous profits, while politicians\u2014beholden to insurers and drug companies\u2014enact legislation for the benefit of the few rather than the many, while the entire system is on the verge of collapse. In CRITICAL CONDITION, award-winning investigative journalists Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele expose the horror of what health care in America has become. They profile patients and doctors trapped by the system and offer startling personal stories that illuminate what\u2019s gone wrong. Doctors tell of being second-guessed and undermined by health care insurers; nurses recount chilling tales of hospital meltdowns; patients explain how they\u2019ve been victimized by a system that is meant to care for them.  Drug companies profit by selling pills in the same manner that Madison Avenue sells soap, while Wall Street rakes in billions by building up and then tearing down health care businesses. And politicians pass legislation perpetuating the injustices and out-right fraud the system encourages. By analyzing the industry and offering an insightful prescription for getting it back on the right track, CRITICAL CONDITION is an enormously compelling investigative work that addresses the concerns of every American.",

        "Description": "Mark Twain called it \"a good walk spoiled.\" Lee Trevino said it was the most fun he ever had with his clothes on. For duffers and pros alike, golf can be both a delight and a torment\u2014often on the same day, sometimes on the same hole. How difficult can it be to take a stick and knock a small ball into a hole? In the obsessive examination of that question lie the joys and sorrows of many a dedicated player. (Is obsessive too strong? Just ask any avid golfer's friends or family.) So it is little wonder that golf has been the subject of numerous cartoons from The New Yorker cartoonists, including such luminaries as Charles Addams, Roz Chast, Whitney Darrow Jr., Edward Koren, George Price, and William Steig. Robert Mankoff, the cartoon editor of The New Yorker, has culled the decades' best, all exhibiting the focus, the passion\u2014and the frequent absurdity\u2014of the golfer's world. This unforgettable collection contains\u00a0one hundred\u00a0pages of cartoons, which, like a hole in one, will leave you smiling.",
