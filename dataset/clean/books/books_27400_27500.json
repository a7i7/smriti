        "Title": "The First Heroes: The Extraordinary Story of the Doolittle Raid- America's First World War II Victory",
        "Authors": "By Nelson, Craig",
        "Description": "The Doolittle Raiders, as they became known, were a squadron of eighty scarcely trained young men led by the famous daredevil aviator Jimmy Doolittle. Their mission-the daring World War II bombing raid of Tokyo and other cities in April 1942-was successful until Japanese spies forced most of the squadron to crash-land in enemy-occupied China, where pilots were ferried underground across the country to safety. One plane landed in the Soviet port of Vladivostok, where the crew was eventually smuggled out of the country through Persia. Others were captured by the Japanese, confined to years of imprisonment and torture. The fact that 90 percent of the men involved came home alive was little short of a miracle.  Extensively researched, including interviews with twenty of the twenty-seven remaining survivors, The First Heroes vividly recreates America's first great victory of World War II. Craig Nelson follows the Doolittle Raiders from their secret training on a Florida airfield to their tense days in transit across the Pacific to the bombing itself and finally to their courageous accounts of survival against astonishing odds. This story of America's striking back at its enemies after a vicious surprise attack will resonate widely with the general public today and is sure to appeal to all readers of Tom Brokaw's The Greatest Generation.",

        "Description": "In this home health reference, which is designed as a first stop for a general audience, alphabetically arranged entries cover a wide variety of health-related subjects including medical terms and procedures, basic anatomy and physiology, and diseases and pathologies. The coverage is brief but thoughtfully prepared so that after a visit to the doctor, for example, a patient can decipher some of the terms that were tossed around but never fully explained. Most entries are a paragraph or several paragrahs ( acoustic nerve, aspirin, astigmatism ; the longest are about two pages ( breast cancer, circulatory system ). Page layout is clear and friendly, with important points highlighted in various ways, and approximately 1,200 color illustrations supporting the text. Entries are cross-referenced, and many include print references and contact information for relevant organizations. The appendix is devoted to emergency medicine and first aid. General editor Gotto is dean of the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, and he provides a brief introduction. The title page identifies this work as the inaugural volume of the Weill Cornell Health Series, but there is no further information about the series. Annotation c.

Meredith Copeland's father, Albert, keeps a sort of written family record in some notebooks he bought to log the flights of his home-built floatplane, a project Albert first undertook in 1956, when his children were just kids. Now that the kids are grown -- Thatcher has a son of his own, Meredith and Mark are back from Vietnam, and Noralee is off dating hippies -- the notebooks are thick with the floatplane's failures to lift off and bulging with color Polaroids of the wisteria blossoms near the family plot, favorite family dogs, Thatcher and Bliss's wedding, records of Noralee's height and weight, a diagram of the graveyard, a newspaper story about wild-child Meredith's many backfired schemes. This novel travels back in time more than one hundred years, to the Copeland bride who first planted the wisteria by the back porch that would take over the surrounding woods, and then down to the present again to show how even though times change, people are pretty much the same.",

Also included are the tragic stories of the 125th Pennsylvania's Color Sergeant, and the little known fate of the tiny Dunker Church at Antietam, and its stolen Bible. From the unpublished diary of Private James Dorrance, Co. A, 7th Maryland Infantry, we learn of camp life, and are saddened by the tragic loss of his best friend in battle. Here, also, is Dr. J. M. Gaines' unpublished list of wounded Confederate soldiers confined to the Hagerstown Seminary Hospital in 1863. These are eyewitness accounts of moments in Washington County history, a piece of the fabric that is altogether American History.",

Now he turns his hand to fiction for the first time with The Village, a novel written with the explosive force and ferocious insight for which all Mamet's work is renowned.The Village brings to life a remote New England community full of dark undercurrents and brooding silences. One after another, the inhabitants of the village reveal themselves to us even as they conceal themselves from each other. Alternating vivid dialogue with the most private thoughts, the author takes us deep inside their secret selves, unfolding in particular the unspoken forces that shape relationships between men and women.These are unforgettable figures: an old hunter whose knowledge of the place is bone deep; a newcomer who chops firewood as his marriage expires; a slinky young woman whose every step unsettles the local males; a store owner fretting his way toward bankruptcy. Through a year the novel traces their lives, unfolding not one but a multitude of stories, revealing the profound interior drama of every human consciousness and the extraordinarily complex interconnections that animate the spirit of a place.Precisely observed and beautifully written, The Village is a landmark work from one of our most important writers.",

Within hours, a homicide detective is the prime suspect in the brutal death that will send shock waves through the city - and reverberate in the professional and personal life of Alan Gregory.Alan knew Roy Peterson. Lauren, his wife, a prosecutor in the DA's office, worked under Peterson for years. And while Lauren contemplates taking on the defense of the accused cop, Alan meets with a new patient. Almost from the moment Naomi Bigg starts talking, warning bells go off in Alan's mind. A terrified mother with an explosive secret, Naomi tests the limits of doctor-patient confidentiality when her privileged exchanges convince Alan that a crime is about to be committed. But when he uncovers a shocking link to the Peterson slaying, Alan finds himself riding the slippery slope between professional judgment and personal responsibility as he struggles to protect his patient while probing the mind of a deeply troubled teenager.As violence erupts throughout the city - and a pattern of vengeance becomes chillingly clear - Alan is plunged into a desperate manhunt for a killer whose trail of rage winds all the way up to the Colorado Supreme Court. As the minutes tick down in a brilliantly conceived vendetta that targets the guilty and the innocent alike, Warning Signs races to a climax in which the lives of hundreds hang in the balance.",
