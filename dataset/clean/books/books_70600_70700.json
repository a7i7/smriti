As Cardinal Ratzinger he was the closest Vatican prelate to John Paul II, working together with him for almost 25 years in the Vatican. When John Paul died, the world saw Cardinal Ratzinger speak so beautifully and eloquently at the pope's funeral, then at the Mass preceeding the Papal Conclave. Soon afterwards, the College of Cardinals quickly elected Ratzinger as John Paul's successor. This book unites these two great spiritual leaders in one powerful, deeply moving volume, complete with over 100 pages of truly inspiring, unique photos by Vatican photographer Giancarlo Giuliani (many never before published) of many striking and poignant moments of the pontificate of John Paul II as he traveled around the world. Ratzinger shares his many personal experiences and insights about this pontificate that changed the world. Illustrated.",

        "Description": "The acclaimed New York Times series on social class in America\u2014and its implications for the way we live our lives     We Americans have long thought of ourselves as unburdened by class distinctions. We have no hereditary aristocracy or landed gentry, and even the poorest among us feel that they can become rich through education, hard work, or sheer gumption. And yet social class remains a powerful force in American life.      In Class Matters, a team of New York Times reporters explores the ways in which class\u2014defined as a combination of income, education, wealth, and occupation\u2014influences destiny in a society that likes to think of itself as a land of opportunity. We meet individuals in Kentucky and Chicago who have used education to lift themselves out of poverty and others in Virginia and Washington whose lack of education holds them back. We meet an upper-middle-class family in Georgia who moves to a different town every few years, and the newly rich in Nantucket whose mega-mansions have driven out the longstanding residents. And we see how class disparities manifest themselves at the doctor's office and at the marriage altar.      For anyone concerned about the future of the American dream, Class Matters is truly essential reading. \"Class Matters is a beautifully reported, deeply disturbing, portrait of a society bent out of shape by harsh inequalities. Read it and see how you fit into the problem or\u2014better yet\u2014the solution!\"\u2014Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed and Bait and Switch",

        "Title": "Inside the FDA: The Business and Politics Behind the Drugs We Take and the Food We Eat",
        "Authors": "By Hawthorne, Fran",
        "Description": "The forces that shape America's most powerful consumer agencyBecause of the importance of what it regulates, the FDA comes under tremendous political, industry, and consumer pressure. But the pressure goes far beyond the ordinary lobbying of Washington trade groups. Its mandate-one quarter of the national economy-brings the FDA into the middle of some of the most important and contentious issues of modern society. From \"designer\" babies and abortion to the price of prescription drugs and the role of government itself, Inside the FDA takes readers on an intriguing journey into the world of today's most powerful consumer agency.In a time when companies continue to accuse the FDA of nitpicking and needlessly delaying needed new drugs, and consumers are convinced that the agency bends to industry pressure by rushing unsafe drugs to market, Inside the FDA digs deep to reveal the truth. Through scores of interviews and real-world stories, Hawthorne also shows how and why the agency makes some of its most controversial decisions as well as how its recent reaction to certain issues-including the revolutionary cancer drug Erbitux, stem cell research, and bioengineering of food-may jeopardize its ability to keep up with future scientific developments.Inside the FDA takes a closer look at the practices, people, and politics of this crucial watchdog in light of the competing pressures and trends of modern society, revealing what the FDA is supposed to do, what it actually does-and fails to do-who it influences, and how it could better fulfill its mandate. The decisions that the FDA makes are literally life and death. Inside the FDA provides a sophisticated account of how this vitally important agency struggles to balance bureaucracy and politics with its overriding mission to promote the country's health.Fran Hawthorne (New York, NY) is a senior contributing editor of Institutional Investor and has connections deep within the business and finance communities.

        "Description": "It's a joy to announce that John Sandford is still doing everything right,\" wrote the Cleveland Plain Dealer about the second adventure of Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigator Virgil Flowers. \"Virgil acts like the best series protagonists-becoming someone we just enjoy spending time with.\" Virgil's always been known for having a somewhat active, er, social life, but he's probably not going to be getting too many opportunities for that during his new case. While competing in a fishing tournament in a remote area of northern Minnesota, he gets a call from Lucas Davenport to investigate a murder at a nearby resort, where a woman has been shot while kayaking. The resort is for women only, a place to relax, get fit, recover from plastic surgery, commune with nature, and while it didn't start out to be a place mostly for those with Sapphic inclinations, that's pretty much what it is today. Which makes things all the more complicated for Virgil, because as he begins investigating, he finds a web of connections between the people at the resort, the victim, and some local women, notably a talented country singer. The more he digs, the more he discovers the arrows of suspicion that point in many directions, encompassing a multitude of motivations: jealousy, blackmail, greed, anger, fear. Then he finds that this is not the first murder, that there was a second, seemingly unrelated one, the year before. And that there's about to be a third, definitely related one, any time now. And as for the fourth . . . well, Virgil better hope he can catch the killer before that happens. Because it could be his own. Rich with the brilliant plotting and compulsively readable prose that are his hallmarks, Rough Country is another immensely satisfying tale by one of our very best suspense writers.",

        "Description": "In The Rules of Business, the writers and editors of Fast Company distill the major ideas and principles of the world of business into fifty-five essential rules. These rules are elaborated on and enhanced by quotes and insights from over 200 business leaders, practitioners, and thinkers into what is sure to be an essential desk reference for managers, professionals, and executives-to-be.Published on the tenth anniversary of the magazine, Fast Company's The Rules of Business features the essential principles behind today\u2019s most important business topics, from customer service to innovation, from strategic thinking to leadership and management. The book introduces each category with a two-page commentary, and weaves two to four essential rules throughout every chapter. At the end of each chapter a boxed, bulleted \u201cFast Take\u201d section gives readers specific takeaways they can use in their day-to-day work. The heart of each chapter, however, is the quotes and insights on the subject culled from the great minds in business, both living and historical\u2014leaders and thinkers such as Machiavelli and Jack Welch, Adam Smith and his invisible hand and Tom Peters on marketing Me, Inc., Michael Porter on (what else?) strategy and A.G. Lafley, Jeff Bezos on the perils of hiring the wrong person and Bill Gates on the value of information technology, Anne Mulcahy and Warren Buffett, and many more. Fast Company's The Rules of Business is the ultimate desk reference.From The Rules of BusinessRule #1    The first rule of business is the same as the first rule of life: Adapt or die.\u201cWhat gets measured, gets done.\u201d\u2014Peter DruckerRule #8Nothing is more overrated than a new idea.

        "Authors": "By Tuska, Jon (EDT) and Piekarski, Vicki (EDT)",
        "Description": "These stories - many of which have not been seen since they were originally published in pulp magazines like Western Short Story, Adventure, or Ace High - reflect a defining aspect of the Western experience: the freedom to choose one's own road, and the willingness to sacrifice comfort, companionship, and safety to follow that road. Whether it is the solitary cattleman in Ernest Haycox's \"Deep in This Land,\" struggling against the elements and his own loneliness, or The Shifter in Max Brand's \"The One-Way Trail,\" trying to escape his outlaw past, the characters who populate these stories are dedicated to the possibility of change and aware of how difficult that change can be.One of the ironies of Western fiction's place in our culture is that it is perceived as \"men's fiction.\" But women made and continue to make a significant contribution to this genre, and this collection highlights some of their best work. Though often forced to disguise their sex through ambiguous pen names, women writers such as B. W. Bower, Honore Willsie Morrow, and Vingie E. Roe mastered the art of the Western short story and made it their own.The stories in this collection represent not only some of the finest writing in the Western genre but also some of the best fiction in American literature. They capture the sunburnt essence of the Frontier, from the Rio Grande to the Rocky Mountains, and are reminders of a time when opportunity was as wide as the horizon.",

Ranging from rocket design to brilliant paranoids to \"in your face\" fighting in Iraq, Von Neumann Wars is a fast paced look at what would happen if the earth was attacked by a robot race that, quite accidentally, was bent on destroying civilization.",

From the formation of the Russian state in the 14th century to the political power struggles of the 1990s and the uncertainties of the new millennium, this new history offers a fresh and systematic account of Russian history across six tumultuous centuries. Drawing on the best contemporary scholarship, thirteen international experts reassess and reinterpret the history of one of the world's great powers. For too long Russian history has been dominated by myths and counter-myths, concocted by those seeking either to legitimize the existing order or to destroy it. New insights into areas previously cloaked in secrecy and an extraordinarily rich array of illustrations, make this book essential reading for anyone interested in Russia and its place in the world. \"[A] brisk, exciting tour of Russia's long journey from its Kievan origins to the early Yeltsin years...stunningly beautiful illustrations and transparent prose.\"--The Los Angeles Times",

        "Description": "In addition to being one of the best-loved books of all time, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is sure to set box-office records when it releases Christmas 2005. Distributed by Disney, with special effects by WETA Workshop (The Lord of the Rings), and backed by a $150MM budget, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe will draw millions of viewers, both Christian and non-Christian. In the same way that Christians walked away from viewing Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ with a hunger to share Christ with their neighbors, Christians will leave The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe wanting to share the Christ depicted by Aslan in the movie. Aslan, killed by the White Witch and raised to life three days later, is a shadow of the One who was crucified and raised to life for our sins.Using biblical parallels, this small, easy-to-read book will lead readers to an understanding of Christ and what He did for them by drawing lessons from The C.S. Lewis book and movie.  Christians will want to buy this book in bulk as a non-threatening, warm-hearted evangelistic tool.",

        "Authors": "By Greengard, Samuel",
        "Description": "Boomers reinvented society. Now they\u2019re reinventing themselves, and AARP wants to facilitate that process.AARP Crash Course in Finding the Work You Love explores both the motivations and the methods of those taking part in the social phenomenon known as recareering. Whether they are old enough to have earned their AARP card or not, a new generation of American workers is no longer counting the days until retirement; instead they\u2019re seeking greater fulfillment in their personal lives by tackling new?and often much more socially significant?work.Switching careers is a challenge at any age, yet boomers may have more to overcome than their younger counterparts: They must beef up their education or seek out retraining; cope with seismic lifestyle shifts such as less income and a new circle of friends; and reconcile themselves to the fact that even the most rewarding position is no panacea for life\u2019s problems. Author Sam Greengard brings a wealth of knowledge to this timely topic: Since 1981 he has written about career issues for publications as diverse as The Chicago Tribune, Family Circle, The Los Angeles Times, MSNBC/MSN Online, Wired, and Workforce Management. Here, Greengard shows readers how to sort out their feelings about their existing career; successfully transition to a new one; and work toward a greater sense of balance in their daily lives. Profiles of recareering veterans show how others have attained their own goals. These are rounded out by tips, quizzes, worksheets, how-to sidebars, and other practical resources.With this handbook to guide them, readers of any age can finally make the leap to finding the life\u2019s work they will truly love.",
