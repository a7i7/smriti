        "Title": "How to Do Bead Work",
        "Authors": "By White, Mary",
        "Description": "How to Do Beadwork is a fundamental book on the craft, covering every aspect in full, not only patterns and operations but selection of materials \u2014 which beads to use, what type of thread, even what size needle. The very lucidly organized text starts the reader off with the simplest projects to complete, five bead chains (some with tassels), and works up gradually to woven works. For weaving beads, instructions are first given for constructing a good, basic loom from a few simple objects, and then directions are detailed for eighteen different chains, various patterned fobs, three belts, and an interesting card case. A slightly more complicated process of weaving follows, diagonal weaving without a loom, and many items to be made in this way (including a particularly beautiful purse with butterfly design) are fully described and illustrated step by step. There are also projects for those familiar with needlepoint or other canvas work, like handsome bags with fringe, and if you knit or crochet there are half a dozen evening bags and purses you can bead. Also included are directions for making lampshades, including an interesting pattern derived from a Sudanese costume; hangings; and decorating burlap curtains. And there is a special chapter devoted to projects for children: an easy-to-make loom for weaving belts, chains, etc., and simple and well-illustrated directions for chamois shirt and bead trim, moccasins, five bead chains, etc. For those interested in the history and ethnography of the craft, Miss White discusses the beadwork of the primitives, concentrating on the artifacts of the North American Indian (many of which are pictured), but also paying attention to the work of such cultures as the Egyptian and Eskimo. Whether you're a craftsman looking for new and exciting projects, a devotee of Indian arts, or a parent eager to find suitable home activities\u00a0for rainy days, How to Do Beadwork is a treasury of delights. Even the novice can create colorful and interesting designs with the right assortment of beads, thread, needle, and the carefully laid out patterns and easy-to-follow instructions provided in this book.",

        "Description": "The Middle East is the birthplace of ancient civilizations, but most of the modern states that occupy its territory today are of recent origin, as are many key concepts of communal and individual identity and loyalty that the peoples of the region now confront. In The Multiple Identities of the Middle East, eminent Middle East historian Bernard Lewis elucidates the critical role of identity in the domestic, regional, and international tensions and conflicts of the Middle East today.Examining religion, race and language, country, nation, and state, Lewis traces the rapid evolution of the identities of the Middle Eastern peoples, from the collapse of the centuries-old Ottoman Empire in 1918 to today's clash of old and new allegiances. He shows how, during the twentieth century, imported Western ideas such as liberalism, fascism, socialism, patriotism, and nationalism have transformed Middle Easterners' ancient notions of community, their self-perceptions, and their aspirations.To this fascinating historical portrait, Lewis brings an understanding of the region and its peoples, as well as a profound sympathy for the plight that the modern world has imposed on them. The result is an invaluable tool in our understanding of an area that is of increasing global importance and concern today.",

It is found in our relationships with ourselves, with our world, with others, and with our Creator. This is the dancing that can come out of mourning: the hope of restored relationships. Mourning into Dancing defines the stages of grief, names the many kinds of loss we suffer, shows how to help the grief-stricken, gives a new vision of Christ's sacrifice, and shows how a loving God shares our grief. We learn from this book that the way to dancing is through the valley of mourning--that grief is a poignant reminder of the fullness of life Christ obtained for us through his resurrection. In the words of writer and critic John Timmerman, Mourning into Dancing \"could well be the most important book you ever read.\"",

We exist to worship God. For years we have been basking in God's love and worshiping Him with uplifted hands and hearts. Now we need to go deeper and see that God is also an awesome, mysterious being that should engender our silent, even dumbstruck-reverence for His holiness, His \"otherness\". Until we are undone by the knowledge of who God is in all His glory, we will only touch the edges of true worship. Matt Redman says, \"When we face up to the glory of God, we find oursleves face down in worship.\" This book shows the biblical record of those who found themselves prostrate before God.",

Matthew and Amelia were once in love and planning to raise a family together, but a decade later, they have become professional enemies. To Amelia, who has dedicated her life to medical ethics, Matthew's job as a high-powered pharmaceutical executive has turned him into a heartless person who doesn't care about anything but money. Now they're kept in balance only by Matthew's best and oldest friend, Ben, a rising science superstar -- and Amelia's new boyfriend.   That balance begins to crumble one night when, coming home to his upscale Philadelphia loft, Matthew finds himself on a desolate bridge face-to-face with a boy screaming for help. Homeless for most of his life, ten-year-old Danny is as streetwise as he is world-weary, and his desperation to save his three-year- old sister means he will do whatever it takes to get Matthew's help. What follows is an escalating game of one-upmanship between Matthew, Amelia, and Danny, as all three players struggle to defend what is most important to them -- and are ultimately forced to reconsider what they truly want.   Dazzlingly written with a riveting story that will resonate with readers everywhere, Lisa Tucker's The Cure for Modern Life is a smart, humorous, big-hearted novel about what it means in the twenty-first century to be responsible, to care about other people, and to do the right thing.",

To help a friend she ends up taking on a case that calls her back to her old stomping ground...   Cursed opens on a cold and gray January morning. Sleet and snow are swirling as Regan arrives at a warehouse in Long Island City with a trunk full of her old case files from Los Angeles. After carting all her boxes into a storage unit, she heads back out into the snow, and her cell phone rings.   Abigail Feeney, a young woman who had lived across the hall from Regan in an apartment complex in the Hollywood Hills, is on the line. Abigail believes her life has been cursed since birth. She was born on Friday the 13th of January, and her parents gave her a name with 13 letters. A hairdresser on movie sets, Abigail was recently injured at work when a piece of scaffolding fell and knocked her over, and her arm was broken in two places. But that isn't why she is calling. \"Regan!\" she exclaims. \"The 'no good bum' has been spotted in town. I desperately need the money he owes me. Can you please come out here and help me find him?\"   Regan immediately knows the identity of the \"no good bum.\" From her L.A. apartment, Regan had often seen Abigail's ex, Cody Castle, sitting by the pool, bent over his cell phone, text messaging nonstop. Before he disappeared three months ago, he borrowed $100,000 from Abigail. He promised to pay her back in three months.   \"Find him?\" Regan asks.   \"Yes! My grandmother is flying here tomorrow. There's a condo she wants to buy me. But we need that money. She can't find out I don't have it. Regan, can't you spend a few days with me?\"   If Regan weren't freezing, she might have made an excuse. But Jack was away at a seminar, Regan had never liked the \"no good bum,\" and Abigail had brought her chicken soup when she'd had the flu last winter. Within hours Regan is on a flight to Los Angeles where her adventure with Abigail will take her from the beaches of Malibu, to the mountains north of the city, to the renovated lofts of downtown L.A.   Regan starts to feel Abigail's curse is contagious as she encounters a cast of characters who aren't always welcoming. Some are downright dangerous. And there's one who is the most dangerous of all...",
