        "Title": "Where Did I Leave My Glasses?: The What, When, and Why of Normal Memory Loss",
        "Authors": "By Lear, Martha Weinman",
        "Description": "So your memory's not what it used to be?  You forget people's names, or what you were just about to say, or why you went into the kitchen.  Often you forget where you left your keys (your wallet, your glasses, your list of Things to Do Tomorrow).  And you worry.  You wonder: Could this mean I am losing it? Join the crowd, friend.  there are seventy-eight million baby boomers in the country, and memory loss is the number one concern of the boomer generation.  The \"Worried Well,\" specialists call them.  They worry because they do not know that most memory lapses that begin in middle age are universal and normal.  Award-winning journalist Martha Lear, who gave voice to widespread frustration with medical care in her New York Times bestselling memoir Heartsounds, now explores this kind of forgetfulness--why it happens, and when, and what can be done about it.  She interviews distinguished neuroscientists, psychologists, and evolutionary biologists, as well as friends and strangers about their own memory lapses.  Interweaving dramatic new findings from brain-scan  studies with often-hilarious anecdotes, Lear covers topics as fresh and provocative as the upside of memory loss, the differences between His and Her memories, why we are actually wired to forget, and what the future holds for memory enhancement (you can't imagine what's in store).  You'll learn things you never knew before about why your memory behaves in such maddening ways.  You'll find comfort and reassurance.  And you'll probably find yourself on every page.",

        "Authors": "By Nathan, Joan",
        "Description": "Joan Nathan, the author of Jewish Cooking in America, An American Folklife Cookbook, and many other treasured cookbooks, now gives us a fabulous feast of new American recipes and the stories behind them that reflect the most innovative time in our culinary history.The huge influx of peoples from all over Asia--Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, India--and from the Middle East and Latin America in the past forty years has brought to our kitchens new exotic flavors, little-known herbs and condiments, and novel cooking techniques that make the most of every ingredient.  At the same time, health and environmental concerns have dramatically affected how and what we eat.  The result: American cooking has never been as exciting as it is today.  And Joan Nathan proves it on every page of this wonderfully rewarding book.Crisscrossing the country, she talks to organic farmers, artisanal bread bakers and cheese makers, a Hmong farmer in Minnesota, a mango grower in Florida, an entrepreneur of Indian frozen foods in New Jersey, home cooks, and new-wave chefs.Among the many enticing dishes she discovers are a breakfast huevos rancheros casserole; starters such as Ecuadorean shrimp ceviche, Szechuan dumplings, and Malaysian swordfish satays; pea soup with kaffir leaves; gazpacho with sashimi; pasta dressed with pistachio pesto; Iraqi rice-stuffed Vidalia onions; and main courses of Ecuadorean casuela, chicken yasa from Gambia, and couscous from Timbuktu (with dates and lamb).  And there are desserts for every taste.   Old American favorites are featured, too, but often Nathan discovers a cook who has a new way with a dish, such as an asparagus salad with blood orange mayonnaise, pancakes made with blue cornmeal and pine nuts, a seafood chowder that includes monkfish, and a chocolate bread pudding with dried cherries.  Because every recipe has a story behind it, The New American Cooking is a book that is as much fun to read as it is to cook from--a must for every kitchen today.",

        "Description": "New York Times bestselling author William Bayer, described by Robert B. Parker as \"a first-rate master of heart-pounding suspense,\" returns with this breathtaking, multilayered new tale of a twenty-five-year-old society murder and the many long shadows it still casts.  A man and a woman are making love....  One hot summer afternoon a quarter century ago, a wealthy socialite and her young lover, a private-school teacher, were gunned down in a cheap motel room on the outskirts of the Midwestern city of Calista. Now, forensic sketch artist David Weiss has returned to his hometown to cover a routine celebrity murder trial for ABC. For someone who has earned a reputation for cracking high-profile cases with his portraits of suspects based on eyewitness accounts, churning out courtroom sketches is merely pedestrian work. But Calista holds other attractions for David. First there are the welcome attentions of CNN reporter Pam Wells. Then there's the notoriously unsolved double murder at the Flamingo Court motel that has haunted him since boyhood.  Like his psychoanalyst father before him, David becomes obsessed with one of the Flamingo victims, Barbara Fulraine -- who was as fascinating as she was enigmatic -- and with the bizarre circle of friends, gangsters, columnists, and lovers who surrounded her. David's father believed that if he could unlock Barbara's troubling, recurring nightmare -- which she called \"the dream of the broken horses\" -- his solution would mark a watershed in his career. Now David, armed with old news clippings and police interviews, as well as an extraordinary psychological case study of Mrs. Fulraine recently discovered among his deceased father's effects, seeks to use his highly honed professional skills to reassemble the face of her killer. But with each eyewitness interview and each fresh stroke of his pencil, David finds himself being hurled down a path of ever-darkening mystery, obsession, and dread.  One of our most elegant and commanding writers of psycho-erotic suspense, William Bayer has crafted a riveting, sharp-edged psychological thriller, perhaps his finest, most compelling work to date.",

The American Sissy cocoons in a safe, virtual world\u2014 Fundadome. He plays with online friendsters and he plays with himself, anything to abate the growing anxiety about everything from terrorists to sex and spinach, air and water. He votes for sissy leaders, who lash out at the world like bullies\u2014sissies in tough-guy drag. He\u2019s so afraid of death and illness he doesn\u2019t really live; he medicates and analyzes. And he\u2019s so busy following the lives of the rich and famous that he has no time to have a rich and fulfilled life of his own. \u201cI don\u2019t mean sissy as girly man versus manly man,\u201d Strausbaugh says. \u201cThis is not about big biceps. It\u2019s\u00a0about shrinking balls. And unless we stop acting like such sissies, soon enough some lean, angry barbarians from somewhere out Beyond Fundadome are going to overrun us, ramming their bayonets in our fat guts like fingers poking the Pillsbury Doughboy, and we won\u2019t\u00a0 be giggling.\u201d Strausbaugh leaves no sacred cow untipped. He is\u00a0 as non-partisan as he is a straight shooter, taking equal aim at Democrats and Republicans, gays and straights, PETA fanatics, and the Christian right. But all is not\u00a0 lost. Sissy Nation offers \u201cmodest proposals\u201d for getting back the gumption that made this culture great.",

        "Description": "Since the evacuation of Saigon in 1975, America has committed its forces to combat in more than a dozen military operations. In America's Splendid Little Wars, distinguished U.S. Naval Captain Peter Huchthausen explores the modern development of America's tradition of small wars. From the 1975 operation to recover the hijacked merchant ship SS Mayaguez in the Gulf of Siam to the 1999 \"relief intervention\" in Kosovo, Huchthausen presents an intimate history of each military engagement. Through eyewitness accounts, thorough research, and his unique insider perspective as an intelligence expert, he offers a fresh analysis of the Iranian hostage rescue attempt, the invasions of Grenada and Panama, the Gulf War, and the missions in Somalia and Bosnia.  This timely and riveting military history shows how America-now the world's sole remaining superpower-has enforced the global \"Pax Americana\" by developing and honing its military capability and making sophisticated use of the media and public sentiment.",

Their quality of both capturing the essence of the fable and inviting any coloring medium made them popular for coloring in the fifteenth century and still make them popular today. You will be familiar with many of these fables, but if there are some you cannot quite remember, new translations from the original surviving Greek texts have been made to give the right sense of these fables as they have been known since the time in 580 B.C. when Aesop created them.",

        "Description": "\"In 1954, William L. Taylor, a recent Yale Law School graduate, joined Thurgood Marshall's NAACP Legal Defense Fund, where he would later write the victorious 1958 Supreme Court brief that forced Little Rock, Arkansas schools to desegregate. In this historic book, Taylor recalls the triumphs, setbacks, and ongoing challenges in the battle for civil rights from his own unique and influential perspective. From the tireless struggle to enforce the desegregation of public schools to recent victories protecting the interests of minority schoolchildren in St. Louis, Taylor has influenced policymakers across the political spectrum. He has written landmark pieces of legislation, lobbied them through Congress, and developed strategies that have led to significantsocial change. In this inspiring insider's account, Taylor discusses civil rights policy over the decades, while also chronicling his encounters with presidents, other legislators, his work with civil rights leaders, and his friendships with the people he has met in the movement. The civil rights movement has been the passion of our times since Brown v. Board of Education. The Passion of My Times is a significant contribution to the literature of the movement and one that promises to energize a new generation of activists\"--Publisher description.",
