        "Description": "The bestselling author of B-More Careful, Shannon Holmes, delivers Bad Girlz, another wild adventure into the streets. The setting this time is the Badlands, one of the toughest and poorest communities in Philadelphia.  Bad Girlz takes you into the mysterious and often dangerous lives of young women who turn to the streets and strip clubs as a means of survival. These are girls who, along the way, suffer bad breaks and find themselves ripe for exploitation by men and women who pretend to be their saviors.  Tender and Goldie were taken under wing by Kat, a veteran stripper, who enjoyed the life and the risks she had to take to stay in the mix of the sex trade. Both of these young and beautiful girls had ended up in dire straits and in need of Kat's help in different ways, but ultimately for the same reasons: They lacked the love and support that most of us expect to get at home and in our communities. Where they live, illegal money is often the only money to be made, and the difference between the law and the outlaw is tough to discern.  Holmes tells a page-turning story of sex, money, and murder in the name of survival and reveals the many ways that good girls, trying to get by in desperate situations, become Bad Girlz.",

        "Description": "The companion volume to the ABC television documentary.Abraham Lincoln, one of the towering figures in American history - and his visage, reproduced as it was in the pioneer days of photography - is a familiar and permanent part of our heritage. Now, in this extraordinary and beautifully illustrated book, we are given Lincoln as we have never seen him before.The text is written by Philip B. Kunhardt, Jr., and his sons, Philip B. Kunhardt III and Peter W. Kunhardt, and is accompanied by more than 700 illustrations - most of them drawn from the celebrated Meserve collection, which was assembled by a forebear of the Kunhardts. They include originals by Mathew Brady, Alexander Gardner, and other leading photographers of the day, and vividly evoke the remarkable life of the great President. From his early days on the midwestern frontier, to his election to the presidency, to his four turbulent years as wartime leader, to his tragic assassination, we get a strong sense of the President, the military leader, the homespun politician, the family man, as we follow Lincoln's striking career. This unique pictorial biography amply demonstrates the courage, devotion to deep moral convictions, and qualities of leadership that have made Abraham Lincoln the man perhaps most admired by Americans even today.With a perceptive introduction by the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Herbert Donald.",

Martin Rayfiel and Claire Swift long ago married other people, yet they have remained faithful to their vow to love each other always. When Martin, now a handsome, elderly man, walks into the office of the town newspaper and tries to tell his tale to the young editor Abby Reston, she is too busy to listen. But the next day Abby finds herself drawn to the gazebo to watch for the annual arrival of Martin and Claire. She waits and waits, but they don't come. Puzzled and intrigued, Abby finds a briefcase that Martin left behind for her, and in it--in photographs, papers, tape recordings, and mementos--is the entire astonishing story of Martin and Claire, a love affair that spanned the globe and somehow survived for fifty years.The only son of the town's wealthiest family, Martin dreamed of being a world-class chef, while Claire, born of poor parents, hoped to be a sculptor. Despite their disparate backgrounds, and in defiance of small-town morality, they left everything behind and traveled together through Europe, until family allegiances suddenly and unexpectedly called Claire home. Before they parted, they vowed that, no matter what, they would meet at the gazebo once a year. Now it's up to Abby to find out what drove these lovers apart, why they continued to meet over the decades, and where they are now.From the picturesque square in the center of a small town to the hotels, restaurants, museums, and boulevards of Paris, Florence, and London, Martin and Claire's story offers a voyage of discovery that transforms Abby Reston's own life. The Gazebo is a haunting tale of love and faithfulness that no reader will ever forget.",

Instead, he gave the whole nation \"a new birth of freedom\" in the space of a mere 272 words. His entire life and previous training, and his deep political experience went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece.  By examining both the address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew, and reveals much about a president so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world and to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns, and how Lincoln wove a spell that has not yet been broken.",

It's time to make peace with your past. The past lives on in everything you think, feel, say, and do. Medical studies show that adults who've had adverse childhood experiences are much more vulnerable to life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. But you can heal the pain of the past and create a vibrant, joyful future. With the practical, scientifically proven techniques in this book, eminent psychiatrist Harold Bloomfield, M.D., will help you:Break the shackles of shame-and feel your true worth.Stop the slow acid drip of regret-and feel truly grateful.Resolve the grief that will not end.Heal the not-so-obvious wounds of love and sex.Forgive and be forgiven.Reawaken to the magic and fun of being alive.Rediscover the passion to live your highest destiny.Through Dr. Bloomfield's dynamic, psychospiritual approach, confusion is replaced by wisdom, bitterness by gratitude, heavy burdens by a lightness of being.

A ruthless serial killer with an unthinkable MO has left a trail of tortured, murdered women in western Maryland and seems to have gone to ground in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. With no leads or any sign of a suspect, investigators must call on the now-famous blind psychic Sherry Moore, a woman whose talent inspires skepticism, but whose results are unparalleled. When she is put in contact with the hand of any dead body, she relives the memory of the departed's final experience. While investigating this case, she is privy to the most savage and terrifying scenes imaginable. However, because the killer is aware of her methods, he keeps his identity just beyond her reach until she resolves to put herself directly in harm's way. When the fiend sets his sights on Sherry, this seemingly helpless woman must demonstrate an almost inhuman strength of will and of body as she attempts to capture the deranged killer without having to pay the ultimate price in exchange.   With Last Breath, George Shuman confirms his status as one of the most captivating thriller writers, and in Sherry Moore, he presents one of the most compellingly original protagonists the genre has ever seen.",

        "Description": "Bad Blood finds Assistant DA Alexandra Cooper deeply involved in a complicated, high-profile homicide case. Defendant Brendan Quillian, a prominent young businessman, is charged with the brutal strangulation of his beautiful young wife, Amanda. His conviction is not a certainty: Quillian was conveniently out of town on the day of the killing, and he has hired a formidable defense attorney who seems one step ahead of Cooper as the trial opens. But with the help of detectives Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace, she is confident she can prove Quillian paid a hit man to commit the crime.Halfway through the trial, a major catastrophe alters the course of Alex's case. A cataclysmic ex-plosion rips through New York City's Water Tunnel #3, a spectacular feat of modern engineering that will be completed years in the future. Carved through bedrock six hundred feet underground, the tunnel will replace a vital artery in the city's rapidly deteriorating water supply system. Was the blast caused by terrorism? Political retribution? Or was it merely an accident? Cooper is quickly drawn into the trag-edy when she discovers a strange connection linking Brendan Quillian to the tunnel workers killed in the explosion.At the same time, Alex meets a mysterious, handsome stranger. Should she get to know him better? Before the answer is clear, she is pulled back into the case, which is becoming more dangerous by the hour. She and Chapman descend deep into the earth to penetrate the subterranean universe of the sandhogs, as the brotherhood of tunnel workers are colorfully known. Their probe soon leads to another murder victim, whose blood may hold the key to Cooper's mesmerizingly complex case. One closely held secret reveals another, and soon Alex discovers that only by unraveling ancient rivalries among sandhog families will she be able to solve the murder of Amanda Quillian -- and save her own life as well.A riveting tale of up-to-the-minute urban intrigue, Bad Blood is rich with New York City lore and fascinating legal insights that only Fairstein, Manhattan's former sex crimes prosecutor, can deliver. Told in her signature authentic style, Bad Blood is packed with the same twists and turns that made her last novel, Death Dance, a runaway bestseller and that never fail to thrill her legions of devoted readers.",

Award winning author and journalist Peter Godwin writes with pathos and intimacy about Zimbabwe's spiral into chaos and, along with it, his family's steady collapse. This dramatic memoir is a searing portrait of unspeakable tragedy and exile, but it is also vivid proof of the profound strength of the human spirit and the enduring power of love.\"In the tradition of Rian Malan and Philip Gourevitch, a deeply moving book about the unknowability of an Africa at once thrilling and grotesque. In elegant, elegiac prose, Godwin describes his father's illness and death in Zimbabwe against the backdrop of Mugabe's descent into tyranny. His parent's waning and the country's deterioration are entwined so that personal and political tragedy become inseparable, each more profound for the presence of the other\" -- Andrew Solomon, author of The Noonday Demon\"A fascinating, heartbreaking, deeply illuminating memoir that has the shape and feel of a superb novel.\" -Kurt Anderson, author of Heydey",

But when it comes to healthy food from the grill, evolution has been slow, producing lots of nutritionally sound but incredibly bland recipes. Until now. Bobby Flay's Grilling for Life is, first and foremost, about getting the biggest, boldest flavor possible from food and fire while making healthy choices all the way. Imagine a lifetime of Espresso Rubbed BBQ Ribs with Mustard-Vinegar Basting Sauce; Bricked Rosemary Chicken with Lemon; Chinese Chicken Salad with Red Chile-Peanut Dressing; Grilled Beef Filet with Arugula and Parmesan; Grilled Salmon with Lemon, Dill, and Caper Vinaigrette; and Garlic-Red Chile-Thyme-Marinated Shrimp. For food that is good for you and full of his signature big style and big flavor, Bobby Flay will teach you how to use herbs, spices, heart-healthy oils, citrus zests and juices, honey, and vinegars in place of sugary commercial sauces and marinades. He'll show you how to enhance flavor by toasting nuts, seeds, and spices on the grill; roasting garlic in a covered grill to add to vinaigrettes and marinades; and grilling slices of lemon, lime, and grapefruit to serve on the side. Bobby believes that we all need a full and balanced diet to be happy and healthy, so the book has everything you need to keep grilling for life: veggies chock-full of fiber; delicious complex carbohydrates (the right carbs) that not only fight heart disease but break down slowly, leaving you feeling fuller longer; fish rich in omega-3 oils; and, of course, the full range of proteins. To sharpen your skills by the fire, Bobby Flay's Grilling for Life includes the sections \u201cEquipment\u201d (a very short list); \u201cFahrenheit 101,\u201d a temperature chart that helps you navigate rare, medium, and well-done; \u201cMeals in Minutes,\u201d offering suggestions for the time-challenged; and \u201cParty Foods,\u201d great party menus for everything from a cocktail party to an Italian feast.",
