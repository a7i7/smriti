He also makes the case for considering the Republican administrations of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover important in the formation of modern presidential management, especially in terms of media relations.

        "Description": "The number one New York Times bestselling author Bernard Goldberg is back with more hard-hitting observations and no-nonsense advice for saving America from the lunatics on the Left and the sellouts on the Right. In Crazies to the Left of Me, Wimps to the Right, Goldberg speaks for the millions of Americans who are saying: Enough!Enough of lunatics like Rosie O'Donnell who think \"Radical Christianity\"\u2014whatever that means\u2014is \"as big a threat to America as Radical Islam.\" Enough of the hyperbolic liberal rhetoric comparing Bush to Hitler and Abu Ghraib to a Saddam Hussein torture chamber. Enough of the liberal media, in particular the New York Times, which Goldberg claims doesn't publish \"all the news that's fit to print\" so much as \"all the news that fits our ideology.\" And please, enough of the military-hating crazies who run San Francisco! (\"Just what this country needs,\" Goldberg writes, \"a city with Rice-A-Roni and a foreign policy.\")But Goldberg doesn't stop with the crazies on the Left. Speaking for fed-up conservatives, he also goes after the wimps on the Right\u2014the gutless wonders in Washington who sold out their principles for power.He's had it with hypocritical Republicans who say they're for small government but then spend our hard-earned tax money like Imelda Marcos in a shoe store. He's also had it with the weak and timid Republicans who won't stand up and fight against racial preferences, too afraid that the Al Sharptons and Jesse Jacksons of the world will call them bigots. In plain English, he's had it with Republicans who are afraid to be conservative!In his most personal, provocative book yet, Bernard Goldberg argues that while conservatives still believe in important things, the jury is out on Republicans. The 2006 election was a wake-up call, he warns, and if the wimps on the Right fail to regain their courage, recover their principles, and reclaim their sense of fiscal responsibility, the crazies on the Left just might win the White House in 2008.",

        "Description": "Since becoming president, George W. Bush has walked away from the Kyoto Protocol, pushed for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, undermined protections for endangered species and wilderness, and retreated from his campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide. But the president\u2019s agenda reaches deeper than these well-known policies. In Bush Versus the Environment, Robert Devine shows how the White House is quietly undermining the entire system of environmental safeguards that has developed over the past thirty years. The administration's tactics include:-Encouraging lawsuits against the federal government that challenge existing environmental laws, and then feebly defending the cases in court.-Ignoring science that doesn\u2019t support the president's goals, and pressuring government scientists to produce the results the administration wants.-Using fuzzy math to overestimate the costs and underestimate the benefits of regulations that protect human health and the environment, which can lead to the elimination of much-needed rules.These are just a few of the administration\u2019s strategies, which are being pursued beneath the radar of a public that overwhelmingly supports environmental protections. Bush Versus the Environment is a compelling and important look at one of the most important issues facing America today, one that will have consequences that last long after Bush has left office.",

        "Description": "Shocked by the teenage violence she witnessed during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, Erin Gruwell became a teacher at a high school rampant with hostility and racial intolerance. For many of these students\u2013whose ranks included substance abusers, gang members, the homeless, and victims of abuse\u2013Gruwell was the first person to treat them with dignity, to believe in their potential and help them see it themselves. Soon, their loyalty towards their teacher and burning enthusiasm to help end violence and intolerance became a force of its own. Inspired by reading The Diary of Anne Frank and meeting Zlata Filipovic (the eleven-year old girl who wrote of her life in Sarajevo during the civil war), the students began a joint diary of their inner-city upbringings. Told through anonymous entries to protect their identities and allow for complete candor, The Freedom Writers Diary is filled with astounding vignettes from 150 students who, like civil rights activist Rosa Parks and the Freedom Riders, heard society tell them where to go\u2013and refused to listen.Proceeds from this book benefit the Freedom Writers Foundation, an organization set up to provide scholarships for underprivieged youth and to train teachers",

Today's citizen is now more likely than ever to violate some unknown law or regulation and be placed at the mercy of an administrator or politician hungering for publicity. Unfortunately, the only way many government agencies can measure their \"public service\" is by the number of citizens they harass, hinder, restrain, or jail. James Bovard's Lost Rights provides a highly entertaining analysis of the bloated excess of government and the plight of contemporary Americans beaten into submission by a horrible parody of the Founding Fathers' dream.",

Their targets may be international organizations or the policies of particular states. Historical examples of such transborder alliances include anti-slavery and woman suffrage campaigns. In the past two decades, transnational activism has had a significant impact in human rights, especially in Latin America, and advocacy networks have strongly influenced environmental politics as well. The authors also examine the emergence of an international campaign around violence against women.",

        "Title": "The French Betrayal of America",
        "Authors": "By Timmerman, Kenneth R.",
        "Description": "Can we trust France? Apparently not. After more than 200 years of shared history and interests, the U.S.-France marriage looks as if it's ending in an acrimonious divorce. Here is the shocking insider account.In the wake of French behavior at the United Nations, where Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin systematically undermined the efforts of Secretary of State Colin Powell to convince the Security Council to authorize force against Iraq, Americans have at best come to suspect our ally of double dealing, and at worst come to view them as the enemy. Almost daily over the past year, new stories have emerged of how the government of French President Jacques Chirac has sought to undermine the U.S. war on terror, publicly sniping at America and inciting other countries to do the same. What's wrong with France? What's behind their recent perfidy? According to bestselling author Kenneth R. Timmerman, the American public doesn't know half the story. After they read The French Betrayal of America, American anger at France will turn to outrage.Timmerman, who worked as a journalist in France for eighteen years and knows the players on both sides, lifts the veil of Jacques Chirac's scandalous love affair with Saddam Hussein, beginning in 1975, when he took him on a tour of top-secret French nuclear facilities. The French attitude toward the dictator, which seemed to baffle American politicians, was in fact entirely predictable. Put bluntly, it was all about money, oil, and guns. Chirac needed Saddam's oil and Saddam's money, and Saddam needed French weapons and French nuclear technology. Despite this, the relationship between France and America was not only amicable but at times very mutually beneficial. That was until the most recent war on Iraq, where France turned the tables, engaging in dirty diplomacy and helping to sway other European countries to their side. French war coverage was not merely one-sided: It was viciously inaccurate, skewed, and openly anti-American. Timmerman also presents incredible new evidence of France's duplicity, including the fact that the French stood to gain $100 billion from secret oil contracts they had concluded with Saddam Hussein.The French Betrayal of America raises questions of whether the nuclear cooperation agreements still in force with the French today should be canceled in light of France's behavior. Our security interests no longer converge, and our economic systems increasingly appear to be at loggerheads. The war in Iraq harshly exposed French treachery and their desire to do business with the worst of international tyrants, putting their economy, their international standing, and their relationship with a 200-year-old friend in severe jeopardy. Shocking new revelations in The French Betrayal of AmericaThe French president lied to Bush and to the public about the war in Iraq.President Jacques Chirac had personally told President George W. Bush well ahead of time that France would be at America's side.France urged Saddam to commit genocide.Saddam launched his genocidal campaign against the Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq to make their region \"safe\" for French oil engineers.France helped build Saddam's long-range missiles and nukes.Based on exclusive access to new documents, provided by Iraq to the United Nations -- that French defense companies were key partners in helping Saddam Hussein perfect the long-range missiles that killed U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia in 1991 and rained terror onto Israel. Chirac has blocked cooperation on a high-profile terrorism case.France's top counter-terrorism judge was ordered to stop cooperating with the United States in the prosecution of Zacarias Moussaoui despite mounds of documents that would have helped the United States to convict Moussaoui of conspiracy to commit mass murder.France illegally sold U.S. military secrets to Saddam Hussein.A prominent French defense company shipped U.S.-designed laser designator pods to Iraq in the 1980s that compromised the most high-tech weapons in the U.S. arsenal.President Mitterrand, a Socialist, became Ronald Reagan's best ally in Europe.The French Betrayal of America reveals the extent of French strategic and intelligence cooperation with the United States at the peak of the Cold War, in areas that will surprise readers on both sides of the Atlantic. The French ran a key agent inside the KGB, whose \"cosmic\" reach -- right up to the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union -- hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union. President Chirac almost went to jail for corruption.Chirac was on the verge of getting indicted on corruption charges in 1999 until he cooked up an immunity deal with the head of the French Supreme Court, former Socialist foreign minister Roland Dumas. While the French corruption scandals are well known in France, they have rarely been reported in the United States and will alternately shock and amuse American readers.The Bush administration is now offering France the secrets of our national missile defense.The French Betrayal of America reveals the hitherto top secret missile defense cooperation between the United States and France that has taken off at precisely the same time the Chirac government was undermining the United States on Iraq. Meanwhile, United States and French nuclear weapons designers continue to meet to exchange secrets of maintaining our respective nuclear arsenals.",

        "Title": "The Wounded Spirit",
        "Authors": "By Peretti, Frank E.",
        "Description": "If you've ever been there,you've never forgotten. The feeling is as haunting and familiar as the smellof a junior high school locker room.It's the feeling of being undersized \u2026 or oversized \u2026 or klutzy \u2026 or less than beautiful. Of being a nerd \u2026 or a geek \u2026 or just, somehow, different.It's knowing you are vulnerable-and someone is ready and willing to take full advantage of your weakness by making your life miserable.It's the fraternity you never wanted to join-the fellowship of the wounded spirit.And bestselling novelist Frank Peretti is a member, too.This book is the haunting true story of pain Frank Peretti never forgot but never, until recently, shared with the world. It's the story of growing up with a medical condition that left him disfigured. A series of surgeries and the slow miracle of answered prayer took care of the deformity, but not the underdeveloped frame or the excruciating reality of being different. And it was for these petty \"crimes\" that Peretti was prosecuted every day at school-especially in gym class, but also in the halls, on the school grounds, even in his own neighborhood. No wonder he found himself relating to movie monsters who were hated but also feared-and who eventually exacted a bloody revenge on their tormentors!In Peretti's case, deliverance eventually came-through time, through prayer, through a teacher's caring intervention, and his own willingness to seek help. But he has never forgotten what life was like at the bottom of the junior high foodchain. And from the reservoir of those agonizing memories he sends a compelling message to victims, to bullies, and to authorities who have the power to intervene-that it's never OK for the strong to abuse the weak. And that we allow such abuse at the expense of our souls \u2026 and our very civilization.Especially in the wake of the massacre at Columbine High School-perpetuated by two troubled but also tormented outsiders--this message takes on haunting resonance. Frank Peretti believes we cannot afford to overlook the continuing reality of wounded spirits, not only in our schools, but in our homes, churches, and workplaces. His approach is both tender and tough as he issues a ringing call for a change in attitude.It's a call for all of us to stop thinking of abuse as \"normal,\" even among kids.It's a call for the strong to stand up and protect the weak, not prey upon them.It's a call for those in authority to pay attention to the violence being done to the vulnerable in the midst of our everyday lives and to take action to help.Most of all, it's a call for bullies and victims alike (many of us are both) to seek the healing and forgiveness offered in Jesus Christ. For that healing is really the heart of this book-the only reality that can break the natural cycle of victimization and abuse.Only in Christ, Peretti reminds, is there hope for the wounded spirits-but that hope ispowerful enough to change everything.",

Whether likening the rhythmic structures of music to playing basketball, teaching sonata form through a story about chasing a pet hamster through a shopping mall, or revealing the connections between classical music and jazz, Marsalis on Music makes so-called \"difficult\" music vivid, immediately graspable, and most of all fun.Produced by an Emmy Award-winning team from Sony Classical Film & Video, the television and home video series \"Marsalis on Music\" was shot at the Tanglewood Music Center with the participation of Seiji Ozawa, Yo-Yo Ma, the Wynton Marsalis Septet, the Liberty Brass Band, the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra, and an excited audience of young people. Its premiere around the world in 1995 includes broadcasts in the United States, Great Britain, Japan, and Europe.",

        "Title": "Cruelty and Silence: War, Tyranny, Uprising and the Arab World",
        "Authors": "By Makiya, Kanan",
        "Description": "The first alarm about the brutality and totalitarian nature of Saddam Husain's regime was sounded eloquently in the widely praised international bestseller, Republic of Fear. Writing then under the pseudonym Samir al-Khalil, Kanan Makiya, an Iraqi dissident in exile, exposed the premise and methodology of Saddam's Ba'ath Party and the power it wields over the state. Now - in Cruelty and Silence, writing for the first time under his own name, Makiya widens his scope to bravely - and certainly controversially - confront the rhetoric of Arab and pro-Arab intellectuals with the realities of political cruelty in the Middle East.Part One, a compelling example of the literature of witness, is a journey through cruelty told in the words of Khalil, Abu Haydar, Omar, Mustafa, and Taimour - the Arab and Kurdish heroes of this book. In a bid to place cruelty at the center of Arab discourse, the author fashions their testimony into stories, or metaphors for occupation, prejudice, revolution, and routinized violence. In 1991 Makiya entered Northern Iraq on a clandestine mission. He was the first person to bring the Ba'ath Party's campaign of mass murder known as the Anfal - a campaign comparable to those perpetrated by the Nazis and the Khmer Rouge - to the attention of the outside world. His account of the Anfal is contained in \"Taimour\" and it brings the journey through cruelty to a close.In Part Two, \"Silence,\" Makiya links these tales of survival to an examination of the Arab intelligentsia's response to Saddam Husain and the Gulf War, showing that the flood of condemnation of the West for its handling of the crisis was barely matched by a trickle of protest over Saddam's brutal massacres of Arabs and Kurds. The words of intellectuals, he demonstrates, are separated by a gigantic chasm from those of the survivors. Makiya is sharply critical of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and also of the way the Gulf War was conducted and left unfinished by the Allied coalition. But he also argues that \"anti-Zionism\" and \"anti-imperialism\" have been turned by the Arab and pro-Arab intelligentsia into a \"politics of silence\" towards cruelty.In his exploration of these \"landscapes of cruelty and silence,\" Makiya lays out the nationalist mythologies that underpin them. He calls for a new politics in the Arab world - a politics that puts absolute respect for human life, and revulsion at cruelty, above all else.",

Healthy, consistent growth is the result of balancing the five biblical purposes of the church.\u201d Rick Warren shares a proven five-part strategy that will enable your church to grow \u2022 warmer through fellowship \u2022 deeper through discipleship \u2022 stronger through worship \u2022 broader through ministry \u2022 larger through evangelism The Purpose Driven\u00ae Church shifts the focus away from church building programs to emphasizing a people-building process.

Today the situation is so bad that less than one-third of the members in some churches attend worship services. Church leaders are crying for help.In an effort to help church leaders, the Billy Graham School of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary conducted a massive research project involving nearly 287 churches. The most revealing aspect of the study was that the higher expectations placed on members, the greater the likelihood that the members would stay and be involved with the church. Using the data gathered from this project, Thom Rainer presents the first-ever comprehensive study about 'closing the back door.' Rainer looks at why people are leaving the church and how church leaders can keep the members.",

        "Description": "In the natural world, all creatures move within an eternal cycle, one that begins at birth and involves the struggle for connection, continuity, and ultimately, the renewal of life.Now, Wild Discovery celebrates this dance of life with a collection of stunning photographs of animals from all corners of the world. Master wildlife photographers have captured the unique expressions of animal behavior in 128 full-color images.Wild Discovery features six chapters, each exploring a facet of animal life. \"Genesis\" reveals the power of the procreative instinct that drives the doting orangutan and the fierce Nile crocodile. In \"Eat or Be Eaten,\" victory rests on the cunning or camouflage of both the hunter and the hunted: A six-spotted fishing spider lurks in a stream for its unwitting prey while a herd of zebras' mesmerizing stripes confuse would-be predators. \"Two Together\" showcases brilliant courtship displays and mating rituals, from the elaborate structure built and decorated by the bowerbird to woo his female to the communal mating song sung by male humpback whales. In \"Sanctuary,\" a home can range from the two inch nest of a tiny bee hummingbird to an elaborate miles-long maze of prairie-dog tunnels. \"Community\" describes intricate relationships on which animals depend for survival - from cooperative fishing sessions by dolphins to the shared mothering duties of mole rats. Finally, \"Circle of Life\" depicts animal aging and death, chronicling the respect still extended to an older lion by younger pride members and ultimate sacrifice paid by the sockeye salmon to ensure a new generation.",

        "Description": "When Germany invaded Poland, Stuka bombers devastated Warsaw\u2014and the city's zoo along with it. With most of their animals dead, zookeepers Jan and Antonina Zabinski began smuggling Jews into empty cages. Another dozen \"guests\" hid inside the Zabinskis' villa, emerging after dark for dinner, socializing, and, during rare moments of calm, piano concerts. Jan, active in the Polish resistance, kept ammunition buried in the elephant enclosure and stashed explosives in the animal hospital. Meanwhile, Antonina kept her unusual household afloat, caring for both its human and its animal inhabitants\u2014otters, a badger, hyena pups, lynxes.With her exuberant prose and exquisite sensitivity to the natural world, Diane Ackerman engages us viscerally in the lives of the zoo animals, their keepers, and their hidden visitors. She shows us how Antonina refused to give in to the penetrating fear of discovery, keeping alive an atmosphere of play and innocence even as Europe crumbled around her.",

No one is spared, and all sacred cows are candidates for the grinder.Do you believe any of the following?Alcoholics Anonymous is effective.Hackers pose a grave threat to the nation.There's a hidden code in the Bible.The Big Bang is an airtight fact.Thousands of species have gone extinct because of deforestation. Licking certain toads will get you high.Most terrorists are Middle Eastern.Wake up! You're being lied to.This book acts as a battering ram against the distortions, myths, and outright lies that have been shoved down our throats by the government, the media, corporations, organized religion, the scientific establishment, and others who want to keep the truth from us. An unprecedented group of researchers--investigative reporters, political dissidents, academics, media watchdogs, scientist-philosophers, social critics, and rogue scholars--paints a picture of a world where crucial stories are ignored or actively suppressed and the official version of events has more holes in it than Swiss cheese. A world where real dangers are downplayed and nonexistent dangers are trumpeted. In short, a world where you are being lied to.Among the revelations inside:Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Sydney Schanberg on John McCain's efforts to conceal information on POW/MIAsHoward Bloom on liars in the mediaRiane Eisler on the realities of human natureJames Ridgeway on tainted blood and moreJim Marrs on missing evidence in important casesGreenpeace cofounder Peter Moore on environmental mythsMichael Parenti on atrocities in KosovoDouglas Rushkoff on the information arms raceGary Webb on the gutless corporate mediaHoward Zinn on Columbus",

        "Description": "Bestselling author Michael Shermer explains how evolution shaped the modern economy\u2014and why people are so irrational about money\u00a0How did we make the leap from ancient hunter-gatherers to modern consumers and traders? Why do people get so emotional and irrational about bottom-line financial and business decisions? Is the capitalist marketplace a sort of Darwinian organism, evolved through natural selection as the fittest way to satisfy our needs? In this eye-opening exploration, author and psychologist Michael Shermer uncovers the evolutionary roots of our economic behavior.\u00a0Drawing on the new field of neuroeconomics, Shermer investigates what brain scans reveal about bargaining, snap purchases, and establishing trust in business. He scrutinizes experiments in behavioral economics to understand why people hang on to losing stocks, why negotiations disintegrate into tit-for-tat disputes, and why money does not make us happy. He brings together astonishing findings from psychology, biology, and other sciences to describe how our tribal ancestry makes us suckers for brands, why researchers believe cooperation unleashes biochemicals similar to those released during sex, why free trade promises to build alliances between nations, and how even capuchin monkeys get indignant if they don\u2019t get a fair reward for their work.",
