        "Description": "This is the story of one woman's triumph over indescribable pain, multiple surgeries, and multiple setbacks. Her hospital experiences were in a number of the leading universities of the eastern United States. Names were changed to protect doctors and universities. Arlene's illness was regarded by the medical profession as extremely rare. Highly respected doctors were frustrated in their inability to find answers to this highly unusual case. In the end, there were few satisfactory answers. Through the years of physical pain and disability, I have prayed many times that God would use me in His service and that He would create in me a heart like Jesus.\u009d Arlene Kauffman uttered these words, which were put into the forward of her book. Arlene Kauffman knew pain like most of us can only imagine. Her resolute faith and trust in God to the end is both remarkable and exemplary. This is a wonderful faith-building book that is difficult to lay aside.",

        "Title": "Shakespeare",
        "Authors": "By Wood, Michael",
        "Description": "In this absorbing historical detective story, acclaimed broadcaster and historian Michael Wood takes an entirely fresh approach to the Bard's life, vividly re-creating the turbulent times through which he lived and painting a more convincing and complete portrait of the artist than has ever before been thought possible. Drawing on an extensive range of sources, Wood takes us back into the staterooms and back alleys of Elizabethan England. Marked by murderous plots and government-sponsored terror, religious divisions and rebellious movements, the Spanish Armada and the colonization of the Americas, the dramatic world in which Shakespeare moved is here conjured up like never before. We enter the lodgings where he wrote his greatest plays and meet the real-life characters who inspired his work: doctors, landladies, musicians, foreigners, and members of London's contemporary black population. With 130 illustrations, full-color and black-and-white, Shakespeare is a book to enjoy on many levels-as both a world-class work of historical investigation and a fascinating yet informative visual feast. Filled with fresh discoveries, Michael Wood's pathbreaking work gloriously reinstates the image of William Shakespeare as a thinking artist, a man who held up a mirror to his age, but who was also, as his friend Ben Jonson said, \"not of an age, but for all time.\"",

        "Description": "A New York Times Best Seller!Books about the Kennedys are legion. Yet missing until now has been the exploration of the bond between Jack and Bobby, and  the part that it played in their rise and fall. Eight years apart in  age, they were wildly different in temperament and sensibility.  Jack was the born leader&#151;charismatic, ironic, capable of extraordinary growth and reach, yet also pathologically reckless. Bobby  was the fearless, hardworking Boy Scout&#151;unafraid of dirty work  and ruthless about protecting his brother and destroying their enemies. Jack, it was said, was the first Irish Brahman, Bobby the last  Irish Puritan.  As Mahoney demonstrates with brilliant clarity in this impeccably  documented, magisterial book, the Kennedys lived their days of  power in dangerous, trackless territory. The revolution in Cuba  had created a poisonous cauldron of pro- and anti-Castro forces,  the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI, and the Mafia. Mahoney gives us  Jack and Bobby in all their hubris and humanity, youthfulness and  fatalism. Here is American history as it unfolds. The Kennedy Brothers is  a fresh and masterful account of the men whose legacy continues  to hold the American imagination. Originally published under the title Sons and Brothers.Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.",

        "Authors": "By Matsen, Bradford",
        "Description": "From the super-heated decade when fishing fleets turned king crab into fortunes, to the annual circus of Bristol Bay's monster salmon runs, to the bucolic life of the open-ocean trawler, the true stories in \"Fishing Up North\" carry the flavor of the modern fisherman's life and fortunes in the waters off Alaska. In \"Fishing Up North,\" you'll Find firsthand accounts of frightening weather, good fishing, terrible fishing, great days, and sweet living from the decks of crabbers, trawlers, longliners, trollers, and gillnetters.Commercial fishing's home ports -- Dutch Harbor, Kodiak, Naknek, Cordova, Petersburg, Sitka, and Seattle -- are classic fishing towns, where docks bars, and even quiet living merge in colorful portraits about life on the last frontier.",

        "Title": "American Heroes: Profiles of Men and Women Who Shaped Early America",
        "Authors": "By Morgan, Edmund S.",
        "Description": "The last two decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in the founding fathers so intense that a reader or television viewer of today might imagine that America was the creation of beings who were flawless in their wisdom and courage. As Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Edmund S. Morgan shows here, Americans have long been obsessed with their heroes. But, drawing on a lifetime of scholarship, he presents a different cast of characters\u2014among them Indians, witches, heretics, and naysayers\u2014men and women who went against the grain, in addition to the stock figures of our national hagiography.Morgan has mined the seventeenth century and has identified several new heroes, among them Giles Cory and Mary Easty, accused witches, who were put to death when Puritanism went wrong at Salem in 1692. Pressured to reprieve herself by admitting her guilt and naming friends and neighbors as confederates in witchcraft, Easty declared, \u201cI dare not belie my own soul.\u201d Her humble statement stands as the ultimate expression of the religious principles that led to the founding of New England, principles temporarily abandoned by the rulers of Massachusetts Bay who tried and sentenced her.While American Heroes celebrates the lives and principles of ordinary Americans, the book also considers the legacy of some of our most prominent colonial and Revolutionary leaders, among them William Penn, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington. Franklin and Washington are best known for standing against the repressive and often brutal regime of Great Britain\u2019s colonial policies, but here Morgan makes the case for their heroism in standing up to their own countrymen. When Americans were demanding precipitate action, Washington and Franklin got the nation off to a good start by knowing when to say no.Whether presenting the scandalous story of a Puritan husband whose on-and-off marriage to a beleaguered Puritan heiress illustrates the nexus between property and sex, or assessing the power of books to subvert the standing order and alter the course of history, American Heroes rises above hagiography in challenging the reader to conceive of American individuality and idealism in new terms. Morgan, who credits his mentor Perry Miller \u201cwith the best historical mind of his generation,\u201d has shown throughout his own career an unrivaled originality and intellectual courage. American Heroes demonstrates Morgan\u2019s fascination with our national identity and his abiding affection for the men and women whose character, honesty, and moral courage make plain that heroism in America can be found in unexpected places.",

        "Authors": "By Roston, Eric",
        "Description": "The story of carbon\u2014the building block of life that is, ironically, humanity's great threat .It could be said that all of us are a little alien\u2014our bodies' carbon atoms first shot forth from supernovas billions of years ago and far, far away. Carbon has always been the ubiquitous architect and chemical scaffolding of life and civilization; indeed, all living things draw carbon from their environments to stay alive, and the great cycle by which carbon moves through organisms, ground, water, and atmosphere has long been a kind of global respiration system that helps keep Earth in balance. And yet, when we hear the word today, it is more often than not in a crisis context: carbon dioxide emissions have sped up the carbon cycle; chlorofluorocarbons are destroying the ozone layer and warming the planet; the volatile Middle East explodes atop its stores of volatile hydrocarbons; carbohydrates threaten obesity and diabetes.In The Carbon Age, Eric Roston evokes this essential element, its journey illuminating history from the Big Bang to modern civilization. Charting the science of carbon\u2014how it was formed, how it came to Earth and built up\u2014he chronicles the often surprising ways mankind has used it over centuries, and the growing catastrophe of the industrial era, leading us to now attempt to wrestle the Earth's geochemical cycle back from the brink. Blending the latest science with original reporting, Roston makes us aware, as never before, of the seminal impact carbon has, and has had, on our lives.",

        "Title": "The Last Thousand Days of the British Empire: Churchill, Roosevelt, and the Birth of the Pax Americana",
        "Authors": "By Clarke, Peter",
        "Description": "A sweeping, brilliantly vivid history of the sudden end of the British Empire and the moment when America became a world superpower\u2014published on the sixtieth anniversary of Britain's withdrawal from Palestine.\"I have not become the King's First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire.\" Winston Churchill's famous statement in November 1942, just as the tide of the Second World War was beginning to turn, pugnaciously affirmed his loyalty to the worldwide institution that he had served for most of his life. Britain fought and sacrificed on a global scale to defeat Hitler and his allies\u2014and won. Yet less than five years after Churchill's defiant speech, the British Empire effectively ended with Indian independence in August 1947 and the end of the British Mandate in Palestine in May 1948. As the sun set on Britain's empire, the age of America as world superpower dawned.How did this rapid change of fortune come about? Peter Clarke's book is the first to analyze the abrupt transition from Rule Britannia to Pax Americana. His swift-paced narrative makes superb use of letters and diaries to provide vivid portraits of the figures around whom history pivoted: Churchill, Gandhi, Roosevelt, Stalin, Truman, and a host of lesser-known figures through whom Clarke brilliantly shows the human dimension of epochal events.Clarke traces the intimate and conflicted nature of the \"special relationship,\" showing how Roosevelt and his successors were determined that Britain must be sustained both during the war and after, but that the British Empire must not; and reveals how the tension between Allied war aims, suppressed while the fighting was going on, became rapidly apparent when it ended. The Last Thousand Days of the British Empire is a captivating work of popular history that shows how the events that followed the war reshaped the world as profoundly as the conflict itself.",

        "Description": "\u201cOne of the finest and most accurate records of the making of the film that I have ever read. I just wished I could remember what actually went on then.\u201d--Terry Jones\u201cIf anyone can remember more about making the Life of Brian than me, it\u2019s Kim \u2018Howard\u2019 Johnson. He came, he saw, he got into costume. While the rest of us were fighting to upstage each other, Howard had a notebook hidden in his toga.\u201d--Michael Palin\u201cSince I\u2019ve forgotten everything, it will be great to read what was actually going on in Tunisia. Just as long as I\u2019m the most quoted, the most vital to the shooting, and the most interesting. You don\u2019t have to mention my stunning good looks if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d--Terry Gilliam\u201cOf all the books that I am planning to read in my dotage, there is none I am more looking forward to than Monty Python\u2019s Tunisian Holiday. . . . Not only does \u2018Howard\u2019 Johnson know more about Python than anyone outside of the IRS, he was in Tunisia for most of the filming of Life of Brian, and is the only person who captured every thoughtless remark, heated exchange, embarrassing detail, petty insult, and spiteful act of indifference.\u201d--John Cleese\u201cKim \u2018Howard\u2019 Johnson was invented by Graham Chapman during an idle moment on the set of The Life of Brian. \u2018Let\u2019s invent a person,\u2019 he said. \u2018An American fan from the Midwest,\u2019 chimed in Michael Palin, \u2018who keeps a daily diary of Python filming. And then doesn\u2019t publish it for years and years.\u2019 How we laughed, and each day we\u2019d make up stuff this \u2018person\u2019 would write about us.\u201d--Eric Idle     In 1978, Kim \u201cHoward\u201d Johnson ran away to join the circus---Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus, that is. The Pythons converged on Tunisia to film their timeless classic, Life of Brian, and Howard found himself in the thick of it, doubling for nearly all the Pythons, playing more roles in the film than John Cleese, and managing to ruin only one shot. He became the unit journalist, substitute still photographer, Roman soldier, peasant, Biggus Dickus\u2019s double, near-stalker, and, ultimately, friend and confidant of the comedy legends. He also kept a detailed journal of what he saw and heard, on set and off, throughout those six weeks.     The result is a unique eyewitness account that reveals the Pythons at work and at play in a way that nothing else written about them could do. Now, for the first time ever, the inside story of the making of the film is revealed through the fly-on-the-castle-wall perspective. Even the most diehard fans will get a fresh take on the comedy greats through some never-before-revealed nuggets of Python brilliance: what John Cleese offered to exchange for suntan lotion; Terry Jones directing in drag; Michael Palin\u2019s secret to playing revolutionaries and peasants; Graham Chapman gets naked; Terry Gilliam gets filthy; Eric Idle haggles; the secret of the Thespo-Squat; Mrs. Pilate; talk of George Harrison; the cake-flinging that jeopardized the production; badminton, impromptu cricket, and erotic frescoes; and the first-ever presentation of \u201cAlways Look on the Bright Side of Life.\u201d      Here, uncensored, are the legendary Pythons in their prime. It was a period of comedy history that will never be duplicated, and Monty Python\u2019s Tunisian Holiday captures the wit, the genius, and the sheer silliness of the six men that comprised Python.",

        "Title": "Solar Revolution: The Economic Transformation of the Global Energy Industry (The MIT Press)",
        "Authors": "By Bradford, Travis",
        "Description": "An innovative analysis that shows how the shift to solar energy\u2014in particular, the use of photovoltaic cells\u2014is both economically advantageous and inevitable, and will rival the information and communication technologies revolution in its transformative effects.In Solar Revolution, fund manager and former corporate buyout specialist Travis Bradford argues\u2014on the basis of standard business and economic forecasting models\u2014that over the next two decades solar energy will increasingly become the best and cheapest choice for most electricity and energy applications. Solar Revolution outlines the path by which the transition to solar technology and sustainable energy practices will occur.Developments in the photovoltaic (PV) industry over the last ten years have made direct electricity generation from PV cells a cost-effective and feasible energy solution, despite the common view that PV technology appeals only to a premium niche market. Bradford shows that PV electricity today has become the choice of hundreds of thousands of mainstream homeowners and businesses in many markets worldwide, including Japan, Germany, and the American Southwest. Solar energy will eventually be the cheapest source of energy in nearly all markets and locations because PV can bypass the aging and fragile electricity grid and deliver its power directly to the end user, fundamentally changing the underlying economics of energy. As the scale of PV production increases and costs continue to decline at historic rates, demand for PV electricity will outpace supply of systems for years to come. Ultimately, the shift from fossil fuels to solar energy will take place not because solar energy is better for the environment or energy security, or because of future government subsidies or as yet undeveloped technology. The solar revolution is already occurring through decisions made by self-interested energy users. The shift to solar energy is inevitable and will be as transformative as the last century's revolutions in information and communication technologies.",

        "Authors": "By Rubenstein, Richard E.",
        "Description": "While acknowledging his belief that there can indeed be just wars, Rubenstein (conflict resolution and public affairs, George Mason U.) argues that just wars are nevertheless very rare and hence wonders how it is possible that the American public is so often convinced of the rightness of the various wars embarked upon by the United States over the years. He examines both the argument that Americans are \"innocent dupes\" fooled by American leaders willing to lie about, for example, the sinking of the Maine, the Tonkin Gulf incident, and Iraq's nonexistent weapons of mass destruction and the argument that the American frontier experience pre-conditions Americans to pursue their interests violently and devalue the lives of others, finding both to have some, but not sufficient, explanatory power. He proposes that the most common characteristic in successful efforts to convince Americans to go to war is the way that moral arguments are rooted in the US civil religion of national exceptionalism and the associated belief in the unique, even divine, mandate for the US to promote liberty, justice, democracy, and associated values around the world.

        "Authors": "By Callanan, Liam",
        "Description": "Set against the magnificent backdrop of Alaska in the waning days of World War II, The Cloud Atlas is an enthralling debut novel, a story of adventure and awakening\u2014and of a young soldier who came to Alaska on an extraordinary, top-secret mission\u2026and found a world that would haunt him forever.Drifting through the night, whisper-quiet, they were the most sublime manifestations of a desperate enemy: Japanese balloon bombs. Made of rice paper, at once ingenious and deadly, they sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific...and once they started landing, the U.S. scrambled teams to find and defuse them, and then keep them secret from an already anxious public. Eighteen-year-old Louis Belk was one of those men. Dispatched to the Alaskan frontier, young Sergeant Belk was better trained in bomb disposal than in keeping secrets. And the mysteries surrounding his mission only increased when he met his superior officer\u2014a brutal veteran OSS spy hunter who knew all too well what the balloons could do\u2014and Lily, a Yup\u2019ik Eskimo woman who claimed she could see the future.Louis\u2019s superior ushers him into a world of dark secrets; Lily introduces Louis to an equally disorienting world of spirits\u2014and desire. But the world that finally tests them all is Alaska, whose vastness cloaks mysteries that only become more frightening as they unravel. Chasing after the ghostly floating weapons, Louis embarks upon an adventure that will lead him deep into the tundra. There, on the edge of the endless wilderness, he will make a discovery and a choice that will change the course of his life. At once a heart-quickening mystery and a unique love story, The Cloud Atlas is also a haunting, lyrical rendering of a little-known chapter in history. Brilliantly imagined, beautifully told, this is storytelling at its very best.",

        "Description": "In this revolutionary new curriculum, Henry Cloud, Bill Donahue, and John Townsend establish a whole new training paradigm---one that equips leaders and groups simultaneously and gives them everything they need to start and sustain a life-changing group. All it requires is a small group and a DVD player. Four sixty-minute sessions train leaders and group members in the foundational values and practices of becoming a life-changing community. These sixty-minute sessions are the foundations of small groups that include teaching by the authors, creative segments, and activities and discussion time. * The group has the chance to review and learn new group life techniques during the year with Thirteen five-minute coaching segments on topics such as active listening, personal sharing, giving and receiving feedback, prayer, calling out the best in others, and more.Each session includes a mix of three elements:* Teaching by the authors* Creative segments (such as modeling dramas, person-on-the-street interviews, personal stories/testimonies, creative multimedia, etc.)* Small group activities and processing/discussion timeThe four sessions include:* Session 1 provides a foundational experience that helps group members get excited about the adventure and life-changing power of small group life. Exercises and guided discussions create an initial sense of connection, safety, and most of all, fun!* Session 2 focuses on introducing values, ground rules, and logistical issues. Relationships are deepened through the group's assessment and discussion of the values most important to them, while exercises facilitate group ownership of these issues. * Session 3 unpacks each of the five key values through in-depth teaching and practical examples. Group members learn that all are responsible for implementing the five values in the life of the group, and they practice applying two of the values during the session ('Be real' and 'accept one another').* Session 4 transitions the group to running on its own. Exercises help the group clarify what their focus will be, and what they want to do in their next meeting (the first meeting without the DVD curriculum). This session also provides an inspiring wrap-up for the course that casts vision for what the group can become if it lives out its values.The Life-Changing Power of Group Life DVD and Participants Guide are available separately.",

It is also the source of some of the best produce, cheeses, meats - and even caviar - in the United States. And it is this cornucopia that Abby Mandel celebrates in her new book of approximately two hundred recipes, calling on the best of American home cooking and the best of the country's bounty used in new and innovative ways.From beef brisket and caramelized onions to corn fritters, from oven \"fried\" chicken to lemon poppyseed noodles, the dishes in Celebrating the Midwestern Table are reminiscent of families around the table, good talk, and warm memories. But these are also recipes that pay due respect to modern taste and concerns for health, and that use less fat, less meat, and more wonderful vegetables and grains than our grandmothers' versions would have done.A longtime Chicago resident, Abby Mandel knows better than anyone what goodness the American Midwest has to offer; as a veteran food writer and cooking teacher, she knows how to translate that goodness into recipes designed to tempt home cooks across the country.",
