They are looking forward to a quiet romantic weekend out of town. Wouldn\u2019t you know their choice of destination provides them with anything but! Regan and Jack had considered going to Bermuda, but instead they decide to spend four days at his parents\u2019 beautiful beachfront home on Cape Cod, a wonderful spot where they\u2019d never been alone. During the summer the house overflowed with Jack\u2019s family, bubbling with activity from morning until night. But to be up there for a weekend in April, just the two of them, sounded like a perfect escape. However, the best laid plans...In the bedroom, Regan opens the curtains to find Skip, the Reillys\u2019 young caretaker, pressing his nose against the glass, supposedly checking for leaks. A moment later, Jack arrives home from the market, two gossipy older women who live up the street in tow. A branch crashed through their living room window, and they need a place to stay. When Regan thought things couldn\u2019t get any worse, Skip comes running into the house, distraught that he\u2019d just discovered Adele Hopkins, the woman renting the house next door, in a heap at the bottom of her staircase to the beach. Regan and Jack run back down with him, but huge waves are crashing on the shore. Hopkins is gone, presumably swept out to sea. Regan and Jack begin an investigation to help their friends track down Hopkins\u2019s family. They start by interviewing two young women who own the shop where Adele had bought the pillows. Pippy and Ellen opened Pillow Talk after they both lost their jobs. When a newspaper article revealing the terrible way the women had been treated by their former employers was posted on the Internet, business took off, they started to become well-known, and the Pillow Talk website became a place for people who had had similar experiences to vent their feelings. Pippy and Ellen just received an anonymous e-mail from someone who spews venom about her former rowing coach\u2014Adele Hopkins. Could she be the same Adele Hopkins? Regan and Jack\u2019s search for clues to this mysterious woman\u2019s identity makes for an anniversary weekend they\u2019ll never forget!",

        "Description": "Delicious recipes for the gluten-intolerant.    Gluten is primarily found in wheat, rye, barley and oats. A recent study suggests that one in 250 Americans cannot tolerate gluten. Many suffer from Celiac disease, a digestive disorder that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food. Many others also suffer from food allergies that trigger a wheat or gluten sensitivity. Quite often, the only treatment is a gluten-free diet.     The Best Gluten-Free Family Cookbook features sensational recipes for baked goods, desserts, and main meals -- foods that are typically avoided in gluten-free diets. Here is a sampling of the appetizing recipes:  Blueberry Orange Muffins or Loaf   Rum and Pecan Pie   Lotsa Lemon Squares   Triple Threat Chocolate Mocha Chocolate Chip            Cookies   Grilled Salmon and Roasted Peppers with Fusilli   Cranberry and Wild Rice Stuffing   Quinoa Stuffed Peppers.     Accompanying each recipe is a wealth of tips and techniques for novice and experienced cooks alike.",

        "Description": "At the foot of the Elwha River, the muddy outpost of Port Bonita is about to boom, fueled by a ragtag band of dizzyingly disparate men and women unified only in their visions of a more prosperous future. A failed accountant by the name of Ethan Thornburgh has just arrived in Port Bonita to reclaim the woman he loves and start a family. Ethan\u2019s obsession with a brighter future impels the damming of the mighty Elwha to harness its power and put Port Bonita on the map.More than a century later, his great-great grandson, a middle manager at a failing fish- packing plant, is destined to oversee the undoing of that vision, as the great Thornburgh dam is marked for demolition, having blocked the very lifeline that could have sustained the town. West of Here is a grand and playful odyssey, a multilayered saga of destiny and greed, adventure and passion, that chronicles the life of one small town, turning America\u2019s history into myth, and myth into a nation\u2019s shared experience.",
