He's lived a hermit's life ever since, and only Russell knows why: Smelly reads minds, can't help it - and it hurts. After all these years, Russell is still the only person Smelly can stand to be near. And now Smelly urgently needs an intermediary with the police - suicidal or not.He's learned that a serial sadist who would terrify Ted Bundy is at play in the Vancouver area. Unfortunately, he's got only scraps of information that aren't enough to ID either the killer or his next victims. And he can't even come close enough to a cop to tell his story.Against his better judgment, Russell brings this unlikely tale to Constable Nika Mandic, a tough but unlucky Vancouver policewoman - and soon the mild-mannered Sixties survivor finds himself conspiring with a telepathic hermit and an uptight cop to track a monster to his lair.But are the three together smart enough to stalk a creature who thinks of himself as the first true scientist of cruelty? If not, Russell's suicidal urges may be fulfilled sooner - and much less painlessly - than he planned.",

Before she reaches the shores of England a fierce storm blows her from the deck of the ship and into the sea to face seemingly certain death.

To save her from marrying a scheming fortune hunter, the widowed nobleman broke his own sacred vow never to risk his heart again. But how could he protect his new bride from the dangers of his own past\u2026or himself from a scandalous passion that would tempt him to risk everything to answer the call of Callie\u2019s love?",

        "Description": "What do we believe? And for God's\u00a0sake why?These are the thorny questions that Lewis Black, the bitingly funny comedian, social critic, and bestselling author, tackles in his new book, Me of Little Faith. And he's come up with some answers. Or at least his answers. In more than two dozen essays that investigate everything from the differences between how Christians and Jews celebrate their holidays, to the politics of faith, to people's individual search for transcendence, Black explores his unique odyssey through religion and belief.Growing up as a nonpracticing Jewish kid near Washington, D.C., during the 1950s, Black survived Hebrew school and\u00a0a bar mitzvah (barely), went to college in the South during the tumultuous 1960s, and witnessed firsthand the unsettling parallels between religious rapture and drug-induced visions (even if none of his friends did). He explored the self-actualization movements of the 1970s (and the self-indulgence that they produced), and since then has turned\u00a0an increasingly skeptical eye toward the politicians and televangelists who don\u00a0the cloak of religiouos rectitude to mask their own moral hypocrisy.What he learned along the way about the inconsistencies and peculiarities of religion infuriated Black, and in Me of Little Faith he gives full vent to his comedic rage. Black explores how the rules and constraints of religion have affected his life and the lives of us all. Hilarious experiences with rabbis, Mormons, gurus, psychics, and even the joy of a perfect round of golf give Black the chance to expound upon what we believe and why\u2014in the language of a shock jock and with the heart of an iconoclast.\"To put it as simply as I can,\" Black writes, \"this is a book about my relationship with religion, where my\u2014dare I say it?\u2014spiritual journey has taken me...what it's meant and not meant to me, and why it makes me laugh.\" By the end of Me of Little Faith, you'll be a convert.",

Three years earlier, Thoreau had put his belief into action and refused to pay taxes because of the United States government's involvement in the Mexican War, which Thoreau firmly believed was unjust. For his daring and unprecedented act of protest, he was thrown in jail. The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail is a celebrated dramatic presentation of this famous act of civil disobedience and its consequences.

        "Authors": "By Genovese, Michael A. and Lammers, William W.",
        "Description": "Each president brings to the White House a distinct set of personal characteristics and a preferred leadership style, but just how much have individual presidents shaped domestic policy? To understand and assess what factors determine one president's success and another's limited accomplishments, it is important to examine both the individual's leadership roles and the circumstances which shape their opportunities for success. This new book systematically examines the first terms of every president from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to William Jefferson Clinton and assesses the leadership style, the policy agenda, and the \"political opportunity\" of each. Each president's success in effecting landmark legislation and other policy change is measured and evaluated.William W. Lammers and Michael A. Genovese look at how different levels of opportunity affect leadership and how each president played the political hands he was dealt. By dividing presidents along opportunity lines, Lammers and Genovese assess how skillful each president was in the art of presidential leadership, what strategies and tactics they employed to achieve their goals, and the policy legacies left by each.",
