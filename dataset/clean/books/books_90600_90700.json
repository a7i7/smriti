        "Title": "Simply C. S. Lewis: A Beginner's Guide to the Life and Works of C. S. Lewis",
        "Authors": "By Peters, Thomas C.",
        "Description": "In the context of our modern dilemmas,... C.S. Lewis remains as fully relevant and now even more urgent than when he lived and wrote in the first half of the twentieth century. The spiritual and moral problems have not gone away; they have grown and multiplied. Lewis's insights have not been outgrown or refuted; they have been largely ignored. If we are wise, we have come to the point where we realize that we can afford to ignore them no longer.C.S. Lewis's many books--from the Chronicles of Narnia and The Screwtape Letters toMere Christianity and Surprised by Joy--are as versatile as the man himself. His uncanny ability to amuse the smallest of children, as well as bring profound understanding to adults, has made his writings timeless favorites that still bear amazing relevance in our life and times.However, Lewis can be terribly intimidating to those who know his reputation as an intellectual but haven't yet sampled his writing. This engaging book--the ideal prelude for anyone preparing to read one of Lewis's many volumes for the first time--offers an excellent introduction to this novelist, professor, and apologist's life and works. The taste of Lewis that you'll get here is bound to leave you hungry for more. So much so that you will put away your fears and be persuaded to experience for yourself the imaginative and spiritual delights his classics afford.This book takes much the same approach as Thomas C. Peters's previous award-winning work,Battling for the Modern Mind: A Beginner's Chesterton. Simply C.S. Lewisseeks to help the general reader discover the delights of Lewis without diluting the power of his work. The author is on staff at the University of California at Riverside.",

The Hidden Power of a Woman traces the tragedy in the garden  where the woman seemingly lost and her garden to the modern day where  women are still fighting to regain what they have lost.\u00a0The  authors, Bonnie and Mahesh Chavda, show how modern feminism and religion  have both failed in the quest to restore women to their rightful place  in our society.\u00a0What is the answer? The Chavdas show that her  power, influence, and insight that was stolen in Eden and hidden for  subsequent ages was returned back to her two thousand years ago when  Christ cried out, \"It is finished!\"\u00a0As the hidden power of God  emerges in the woman who fully follows Christ, get ready for empowerment  in the church, redemption in society, miracles in the body, and  blessings on the human race unequal to any generation previous. The new  thing God began when he made a woman as the crowning glory of his  creation work and was lost in that same Garden will be restored once  again",

        "Description": "Begun as the United States moved its armed forces into Iraq, Rashid Khalidi's powerful and thoughtful new book examines the record of Western involvement in the region and analyzes the likely outcome of our most recent Middle East incursions. Drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of the political and cultural history of the entire region as well as interviews and documents, Khalidi paints a chilling scenario of our present situation and yet offers a tangible alternative that can help us find the path to peace rather than Empire.We all know that those who refuse to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Sadly, as Khalidi reveals with clarity and surety, America's leaders seem blindly committed to an ahistorical path of conflict, occupation, and colonial rule. Our current policies ignore rather than incorporate the lessons of experience. American troops in Iraq have seen first hand the consequences of U.S. led \"democratization\" in the region. The Israeli/Palestinian conflict seems intractable, and U.S. efforts in recent years have only inflamed the situation. The footprints America follows have led us into the same quagmire that swallowed our European forerunners. Peace and prosperity for the region are nowhere in sight.This cogent and highly accessible book provides the historical and cultural perspective so vital to understanding our present situation and to finding and pursuing a more effective and just foreign policy.From the Hardcover edition.",

It discusses the general landscape of American environmental policy and describes the policy process and institutional contexts. It discusses cross-cutting issues of risk assessment, environmental justice, and regulatory economics. It then provides chapters that focus more specifically on air and water pollution regulation, regulation of toxic and hazardous substances, energy policy, public land policy, and climate diplomacy. The new edition has been updated to include analysis of the impact of the George W. Bush administration on domestic environmental policy, recent shifts in public opinion and its impact on policy making, changes in environmental trends and indicators, and other recent developments.

If the Battle of Lexington and Concord was, in the immortal words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, the \u201cshot heard round the world,\u201d Bunker Hill was the volley that rocked Britain\u2019s Parliament and the ministry of King George III to its core. The Battle of Bunker Hill was the first hostile engagement of the Revolution between two organized armies, and the first time that a genuine American army had ever taken the field. It gave the British their first inkling that the Colonial rabble-in-arms they had envisioned might actually prove to be a formidable fighting force.In this book, award-winning author James L. Nelson tells the exciting and dramatic story of the fight that changed the face of the American Revolution. He looks at the events leading up to that fateful day, the personalities on both the British and American sides who made momentous decisions, and the bloody outcome of those crucial choices, which would affect the British strategy on the battlefield throughout the coming six more years of active warfare.A masterful new history of the first set-piece battle of the Revolutionary War, With Fire and Sword offers critical new insights into one of the most important actions of our country\u2019s founding.",

Into the heart of the firestorm, American ambassador Stephen Metcalf has been summoned to find the one man who controls the levers of power in absolute secrecy-an official known only as the Dirizhor. His support of the bloody coup will bring the entire world to the brink of nuclear war. Metcalfe is the only man with the cunning to reach him and to convince him to resist. It's up to Metcalf to change the course of history. He's done it before.For Metcalf, returning to Russia is also a personal mission that will stretch across three continents and fifty years into his past where the loyalties of a former love-a woman both impossibly beautiful and possibly treacherous-were tested; where the shadow of a Nazi assassin still haunts; a debauched German aristocrat manipulated the destiny of everyone he touched. Now, as past and present converge, Metcalf braces himself for a new trial of trust and betrayal, one with chilling implications that could threaten what remains of the free world.",

In frank, witty, incisive reviews, the book sifts out the indispensable from the intolerable, pointing fans to the treasures and steering them clear of the fool's gold.Compiled by Nashville's Country Music Foundation, Country on Compact Disc brings together the most knowledgeable writers covering American music, including Nick Tosches, Chet Flippo, Colin Escott, Ben Fong-Torres, and Robert K. Oermann. All told, the reviewers cover more than 2,000 compact discs and 500 country artists, offering pithy summations of each artist's style and CD output. As a counterweight to their opinions, Country on Compact Disc also indicates whether albums have achieved gold (500,000 units sold) or platinum status (1 million sold). Useful appendixes include a listing of the top rated CD's by artist and an index of all #1 country hits since 1944, cross-referenced to their appearance on CD. Backed by the archival resources and expertise of the CMF, Country on Compact Disc is an essential reference for all lovers of country music.",

Some girls were paired with laotongs, \u201cold sames,\u201d in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments.With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become \u201cold sames\u201d at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages, loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart.Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a brilliantly realistic journey back to an era of Chinese history that is as deeply moving as it is sorrowful. With the period detail and deep resonance of Memoirs of a Geisha, this lyrical and emotionally charged novel delves into one of the most mysterious of human relationships: female friendship.From the Hardcover edition.",
