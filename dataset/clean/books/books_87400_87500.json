        "Authors": "By Wallison, Peter J.",
        "Description": "An icon of the twentieth century, Ronald Reagan has earned a place among the most popular and successful U.S. presidents. In this compelling firsthand account of Reagan\u2019s presidency, Peter J. Wallison, former White House Counsel to President Reagan, asserts that Reagan took office with a fully developed public philosophy and strategy for governing that was unique among modern presidents. \u201cI am not a great man,\u201d Reagan once said, \u201cjust committed to great ideas.\u201d Wallison shows how Reagan\u2019s unyielding attachment to certain key ideas\u2014communicated through his speeches\u2014created a cohesive administration and revived the spirit of the nation. Reagan limited his personal efforts to those issues he considered central to his presidency, choosing to delegate to his cabinet and staff those matters he viewed as secondary to his agenda. This leadership style was responsible for Reagan\u2019s accomplishments, but also for his missteps and the criticism he received from his detractors.During his presidency, Reagan experienced both enormous success\u2014in the unprecedented growth of the economy, the first arms reduction agreement with the former Soviet Union, and the revival of confidence in America\u2014and near disaster in the Iran-Contra affair. In Ronald Reagan, Wallison describes what it was like to be on Reagan\u2019s White House staff and how Reagan\u2019s attachment to principle produced both the best and worst days of his presidency.",

        "Description": "Success often depends on the strength of a single quality: leadership. Winston Churchill is universally recognized as one of the 20th century's great political leaders and his words ring just as true in the world of commerce. A wise, witty, and inspiring leader, Churchill ran Great Britain like a great corporation.\"Perhaps the finest book on practical leadership ever written.\" \u2014 Brian TracyChurchill on Leadership demonstrates that the principles that guided Churchill ably translate to private industry today. Author Steven F. Hayward gives strong evidence that, if you remove Churchill from his political context, he would have the resume to be among the great business leaders of any age. Churchill: \u2022 was a financier (as chancellor of the Exechequer) and labor negotiator (as home secretary)\u2022 managed a large transportation network (as head of the British Navy) and far-flung property holdings (as colonial secretary)\u2022 persevered through bankruptcies and other financial disasters\u2022 conceived and introduced innovative new products over the opposition of his colleagues, and reorganized major production operations in the midst of crisis.With wit and insight, Hayward reveals Churchill's secrets for business success from assembling and inspiring a first-rate team to preparing a wise budget, from communicating a vision to structuring effective meetings, from acting decisively to rebounding from a failure. Laced with epochal events from the historical stage, enlivened with stimulating speculation, and leavened with wit,Churchill on Leadership is both an enjoyable read and a thought-provoking lesson on leadership.",

Because she is at the fulcrum of a deadly political battle between conjurers in an alternate world where \"Roumania\" is a leading European power, Miranda was hidden by her aunt in our world, where she was adopted and raised in a quiet Massachusetts college town. The narrative is split between our world and the people in Roumania working to protect or to capture Miranda: her Aunt Aegypta Schenck versus the mad Baroness Ceaucescu in Bucharest, and the sinister alchemist, the Elector of Ratisbon, who holds her true mother prisoner in Germany. This is the story of how Miranda -- with her two best friends, Peter and Andromeda -- is brought back to her home reality. Each of them is changed in the process and all will have much to learn about their true identities and the strange world they find themselves in.This story is a triumph of contemporary fantasy.",

Now her gifted pen sweeps us to the colorful streets of present-day New Orleans and to Europe, past and present, where we follow the parallel lives of two women. One modern, one ancestral, these extraordinary heroines embark - one hundred and fifty years apart - upon a European odyssey towards their destiny.When Joletta Caressa's beloved grandmother dies, she takes with her the secret formula to a legendary perfume believed to have been worn by Cleopatra and Empress Josephine - and which is now the most desperately sought perfume on the market. Joletta's only clue to the formula is the journals written by her ancestress, Violet Fossier, who in 1854 made a grand tour of Europe. Joletta realizes she must follow Violet's itinerary across the European continent, using the events that took place and the scenes she visited to decipher the code to the formula.As Joletta follows Violet's journey, the story goes back in time, to nineteenth-century Europe and a scandalous love affair that is intimately bound up in the mystery of the perfume. In the present, Joletta finds herself attracted to - and suspicious of - Rone Adamson, a Southern playboy whose astounding knowledge of perfume makes Joletta wary. Yet his chivalrous charms prove too much for her scruples and Joletta succumbs to her dubious white knight, even as danger swirls around them....Sweeping from modern London to Napoleon's France, from the Swiss Alps to the canals and palazzi of Italy and finally to a secret garden outside Venice where the answers to so many questions lie, here is a spellbinding novel of two passionate women who dare to live their wildest dreams.

But the purpose of Craig Wroe, an actor himself, is not to provide instruction on how to refine acting, singing or dancing talents or how to land a job in the chorus of  The Producers . Plenty of other books do that. His aim is far broader   to help you survive in the crowded, frantic, expensive maelstrom that is New York. From finding a decent, reasonably inexpensive place to live to finding competent, reasonably inexpensive dental care, from getting computer training to organize your day-to-day existence to joining a gym to harden your body, from eating well to dressing better   all on a tight budget   there is virtually no aspect of life in New York that is not covered in this book. And it not only names names; it gives addresses and phone numbers as well. And keep in mind that newly-arrived lawyers, accountants, models, writers you name them need these things too.",

During the Antarctic spring and summer of 2005-2006, author Fen Montaigne spent five months working on Fraser's field team, and he returned with a moving tale that chronicles the beauty of the wildest place on earth, the lives of the beloved Ad\u00e9lies, the saga of the discovery of the Antarctic Peninsula, and the story\u2014told through Fraser's work\u2014of how rising temperatures are swiftly changing this part of the world. Captivated by the tale of these polar penguins and a memorable field season in Antarctica, readers will come to understand that the fundamental changes Fraser has witnessed in the Antarctic will soon affect our lives.",
