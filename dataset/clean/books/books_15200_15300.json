After she narrowly survived a stalking killer in that best-selling novel, grateful fans clamored for her return. Mary Higgins Clark obliged with several splendid short stories starring the ever-resourceful Alvirah and her occasionally befuddled but always dependable mate, Willy.Here are Alvirah and Willy, ensconced in their spacious Central Park South condo, surrounded by the rich and famous, some of whom just can't go on living (\"The Body in the Closet\"). But then Alvirah has become something of a celebrity herself and even appears on the Donahue show, thereby giving unfortunate ideas to a bunch of kidnappers who demand a hefty ransom for her hapless hubby (\"Plumbing for Willy\").When they're not solving dastardly crimes or extricating themselves from danger in Manhattan, Alvirah and Willy like to escape to Cape Cod. Even there, however, they find plenty to keep Alvirah's steel-trap mind occupied (\"Death on the Cape\"), not to mention solving the problems of a fellow lottery winner in distress (\"A Clean Sweep\"), or returning to the Cypress Point Spa to solve a brutal slaying among the rich and beautiful (\"The Lottery Winner\"), or - as a surprise - the unexpected bonus of a Willy and Alvirah Christmas tale of suspense (\"Bye, Baby Bunting\").",

As a businessman, he was Vice President of Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's, but he was also a diplomat, an anti-Nazi crusader, a pioneer in radio broadcasting, and a well-respected author. Music, however, was the underlying theme of his life, and his deepest passion.As founder and president of the influential New Friends of Music, which opened the rich world of chamber music to the American public, Hirschmann worked with many of the musical luminaries of our century, some of whom became close personal friends.In Obligato we meet Arturo Toscanini, Artur Schnabel - with whom he studied the piano - Bruno Walter, Lotte Lehmann, Arnold Schonberg, Rudolph Serkin, Bela Bartok, and many others.But Obligato is much more than just a collection of revealing episodes. For Hirschmann, music was a life-giving source which frequently played a decisive role in all his activities - whether he was fighting the Nazis and working for the release of concentration camp inmates, or was active in politics with his friend Fiorello LaGuardia, or was experimenting with new technologies. Completed shortly before his death in 1989 at the age of 88, Obligato captures an important era of American music history with great charm and enthusiasm.",

        "Authors": "By Wesley, Mary",
        "Description": "Sylvester Wykes is on his usual train ride home to London when suddenly he smells the burn of brakes as the emergency cord is pulled and the train hisses to a stop in the middle of the countryside. A white-faced woman has leapt from the moving train to save a sheep stranded near the tracks. As the other passengers look on in horror and embarrassment, Wykes sees something more: a face full of anguish. He is captivated by the woman, and continues to watch as she leaves the train and threads her way through the hurrying crowd. Dressed in a long black coat down to her ankles and a big black hat pulled low over her nose, she reminds him of Greta Garbo in the film Ninotchka, seen long ago in black and white.Only later will Sylvester learn the source of Julia Piper's sorrow: the sudden deaths of both her husband and child in an automobile accident. Julia is still stunned by her loss, unable to fill her days, yet unable to share her grief with anyone. Even the trip downstairs to the corner store, which is owned by the doting Patel family, is nearly more than she can bear. Sylvester's life is also at sixes and sevens - his wife has left him, and though he's curiously unmoved by her desertion, he finds himself impulsively posting an advertisement on the bulletin board at the corner store: Cleaner wanted four hours a week. And unbeknownst to any of them, it is Julia herself - in a desperate attempt to do something - who will answer his ad.Sylvester is never home when his cleaning lady arrives and it is the Patels who supply Julia with the key to the apartment. The only way Sylvester knows she's been there is that the apartment is spotless - and by her little notes, reminding him \"You need more bath soap\" and \"Your garden requires TLC.\" It will be Julia who supplies the loving care the garden needs - and in bringing it back to life, she brings several other things to life as well.A train ride interrupted, a life interrupted: from this chance encounter unfolds a tale of unforgettable strength - of grief, release, comic fatalism, and the \"imaginative experience\" of love.",

Through his bestselling books, his national seminars and his infomercial, which reaches 90 million cable television homes across the United States, Gray has brought a powerful message to millions of people. He explains how better communication and recognition of men&#39;s and women&#39;s different emotional needs lead to greater intimacy. In Mars and Venus in Love, we see his principles in action through stories told by people who, using his advice and counsel, have created fulfilling, healthy and loving relationships. We will recognize ourselves and our partners in the funny and poignant scenes depicted in these stories, each accompanied by John Gray&#39;s commentary. After the incredible response to his work, Gray thought the successes of some couples might inspire other like them. With that in mind, he asked readers who were willing to share their stories to write in with the answers to such questions as: What kind of problems have you had in your relationship and how have you overcome them? What kinds of special things do you and your partner do for each other? How do you best communicate with each other? How do you practice what you&#39;ve learned? How does your love feel different now from how it felt before? This is a book of love stories -- a collection of true-life tales that will show you something about your own love story that may have eluded you for a long time. A few insights, techniques and changes in habits of mind and body nourish love and make it grow, and like little one-act plays these stories show you how. Mars and Venus in Love gives you the opportunity to see yourself in the stories of others and to recognize your own communication and behavior patterns in the circumstances they describe.",

There's power in anger, sure, a power that can help you survive. But true wisdom is in knowing when to let it go.  In Still Waters, Jennifer Lauck continues the riveting true story begun in her critically acclaimed memoir, Blackbird.  Clutching her pink trunk filled with secret treasures, the last relics of a lost childhood, twelve-year-old Jenny steps off a bus in Reno and straight into the wide-open future, where no path is certain except that of her own heart....Separated from her brother, Bryan, and passed from caretaker to caretaker, Jenny endures as she always has: by following the inner compass of the survivor. But when Bryan chooses a shocking, tragic destiny, Jenny must at last confront the secrets, lies, and loneliness that have held her prisoner for years. Embarking on a search for answers, the adult Jenny discovers that the past cannot be locked away forever -- even when unraveling one's own anger and pain seems an impossible feat. Now, in the warmth and understanding of her marriage, in the eyes of her child, and in powerful conversations with a dynamic young priest, Jennifer finds her own miracles. A hardened heart learns to love. A damaged soul finds peace. And life, once merely a matter of survival, becomes rich with the joys of truly living.",

It's at school, on Halloween, and even when she makes breakfast in bed for her mother on Mother's Day. Listen to Olivia. She's an older sister and she knows: Sophie is not just messy. She is super-completely and totally the MESSIEST. Oh...there are some good things about Sophie, too. She's kind and nice and funny and great at puzzles and dancing. But Olivia is willing to bet her best bracelet that Sophie will never be practically perfect, like her.  Judith Viorst's totally messy Sophie and oh-so-virtuous Olivia will speak to slobs and neatniks alike.

Her \"larger than life heroes and heroines make you believe all the warm, wonderful, wild things in life\" (Rendezvous). Now the New York Times bestselling author of Tidings of Great Joy delivers an exquisitely sensual tale of a young woman's sudden, irresistible affair with a stranger--a man with a secret that could shatter her life.Since the death of her husband, Alicia Russell has struggled to take care of her two young sons alone. Now fiercely independent, she is determined to never again depend on another person. But when a sudden storm threatens to ruin a family camping trip, Alicia finds it hard to say no to a stranger offering a night's refuge--especially when the man playing hero offers much more than shelter from the storm.Handsome, sensual, and slightly mysterious, Pierce Reynolds showers much-needed attention on Alicia's sons--and reminds her, after so many years of solitude, how it feels to be desired. But even as he tempts her to explore her newly reawakened longings, he holds her at arm's length, his only explanation a silent refusal to share the secrets of his heart. Torn by the fear that Pierce can't provide the emotional support she and her children deserve, Alicia returns to Los Angeles and struggles to move on without him. But when a crisis brings Pierce back into her life, Alicia knows she can't give him up again without a fight. Alicia has already learned that life comes with no guarantees. But can she convince the man who'd renewed her hope that love is a risk worth taking?Tender, tantalizing, and never less than irresistible, Send No Flowers is one of Sandra Brown's classic romances, available in hardcover for the first time.",
