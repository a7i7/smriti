Not only is the sport dramatically more popular, but women runners and beginning runners-who are a large part of the growth-have very different needs in the areas of injury and health that have not been covered adequately in previous books.

        "Description": "In this classic work by one of America's most distinguished historians, Daniel Boorstin enters into Thomas Jefferson's world of ideas. By analysing writings of 'the Jeffersonian Circle,' Boorstin explores concepts of God, nature, equality, toleration, education and government in order to illuminate their underlying world view. The Lost World of Thomas Jefferson demonstrates why on the 250th anniversary of his birth, this American leader's message has remained relevant to our national crises and grand concerns. \"The volume is too subtle, too rich in ideas for anyone to do justice to it in brief summary, too heavily documented and too carefully wrought for anyone to dismiss its thesis. . . . It is a major contribution not only to Jefferson studies but to American intellectual history. . . . All who work in the history of ideas will find themselves in Mr. Boorstin's debt.\"\u2014Richard Hofstadter, South Atlantic Monthly",

        "Title": "Central Europe: Enemies & Neighbors & Friends",
        "Authors": "By Johnson, Lonnie R.",
        "Description": "This historical survey of Central Europe covers a region that encompasses contemporary Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia. Central Europe abandons the Cold War convention of defining Central Europe in the bipolar terms of \"East\" and \"West\", and emphasizes the underlying continuities in the region's history. It opens with the initial conversion of the \"pagan\" peoples of the region to Christianity before 1000 A.D. and ends with the revolutions of 1989 and the problems of post-Communist states today. Johnson provides a broad comparative overview of the events, national traditions, conflicts, and patterns of development that are essential for an appreciation of how Central Europeans view their histories, themselves, and each other.  Each chapter is thematically organized around issues or events that are important in helping students develop an understanding of the region's internal dynamics. Johnson illuminates the competing religious, cultural, economic, national, and ideological interests that have driven the history of Central Europe. Thorough, objective, and focused, Johnsons work stands out both as a useful core text covering an area of growing interest and a brilliant account of a region that is only just beginning to receive the attention it deserves.",

        "Description": "\"Dusty Baker was a natural hitter and is a good communicator. I highly recommend this book as a teaching aid for players of all age groups.\" -- Hank Aaron  You Can Teach Hitting is more than a set of instructions and guidelines for swinging a bat.  It's a book written for baseball teachers--coaches, parents, even peers--who want to teach hitting better. And for hitters--youngsters and professionals--who want to learn to hit better.  You Can Teach Hitting takes you from selecting your bat to selecting your pitch. From the science of the swing to the art of situational hitting. And it shows, step by step, how you can teach--or achieve--the \"Three C's\" of hitting--confidence, concentration, consistency--while avoiding the ten most common mistakes.   And because baseball is a team sport, this book also provides hitting drills, specific approaches to hitter development by age, and tips on organizing more effective team practices.   You Can Teach Hitting will help everyone get more out of their game. From beginning coaches to veterans. From teeballers to advanced hitters. It's pure baseball. A book that's bound to make the game more fun for young hitters--and more challenging for young pitchers.  Johnnie B. \"Dusty\" Baker, an outstanding hitter through fifteen major league seasons, is the former batting coach and current manager for the San Francisco Giants, where he's helped develop hitters the likes of Will Clark, Matt Williams, Robby Thompson, and Kevin Mitchell.   Jeff Mercer, a highly regarded hitting instructor and former assistant coach at Indiana University, brings a knowledge and experience of the game that will improve you as a coach or a hitter.   Marv Bittinger, teacher and author of better than 100 mathematics textbooks selling over six million copies, contributes his proven writing talents and an unrestrained love of the game to this unique collaboration.",

As a bonus, the PennDutch and its barn are booked solid - though she prefers the bovine guests to several of the humans. But then someone clobbers the contest's originator, Doc Shafor, while he's admiring the cows, and Magdalena ends up in the hospital as well, when she faints at his bedside.Gabriel knows as much about cows as he does about baling hay, but he gamely agrees to stand in as emcee. But when Magdalena recovers, she finds that the competition has been cut short, and that both Gabriel and her foster daughter, Alison, are missing. With the help of her best friend (and the hindrance of her mother-in-law), Magdalena begins to separate the curds from the whey, and vows to track down clues until the cows - and her family - come home.",

Wells, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics\u00a0series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.\u00a0The Time Machine, H. G. Wells\u2019s first novel, is a tale of Darwinian evolution taken to its extreme. Its hero, a young scientist, travels 800,000 years into the future and discovers a dying earth populated by two strange humanoid species: the brutal Morlocks and the gentle but nearly helpless Eloi.The Invisible Man mixes chilling terror, suspense, and acute psychological understanding into a tale of an equally adventurous scientist who discovers the formula for invisibility\u2014a secret that drives him mad.Immensely popular during his lifetime, H. G. Wells, along with Jules Verne, is credited with inventing science fiction. This new volume offers two of Wells\u2019s best-loved and most critically acclaimed \u201cscientific romances.\u201d In each, the author grounds his fantastical imagination in scientific fact and conjecture while lacing his narrative with vibrant action, not merely to tell a \u201cripping yarn,\u201d but to offer a biting critique on the world around him. \u201cThe strength of Mr. Wells,\u201d wrote Arnold Bennett, \u201clies in the fact that he is not only a scientist, but a most talented student of character, especially quaint character. He will not only ingeniously describe for you a scientific miracle, but he will set down that miracle in the midst of a country village, sketching with excellent humour the inn-landlady, the blacksmith, the chemist\u2019s apprentice, the doctor, and all the other persons whom the miracle affects.\u201d\u00a0Alfred Mac Adam teaches literature at Barnard College-Columbia University. He is a translator and art critic.",

You no longer use HTML and XHTML as design tools, but strictly as ways to define the meaning and structure of web content. And Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to page layout. When you follow the standards, both the site's design and underlying code are much cleaner. But how do you keep all those HTML and XHTML tags and CSS values straight? Jennifer Niederst-Robbins, the author of our definitive guide on standards-compliant design, Web Design in a Nutshell, offers you the perfect little guide when you need answers immediately: HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference. This revised and updated new edition takes the top 20% of vital reference information from her Nutshell book, augments it judiciously, cross-references everything, and organizes it according to the most common needs of web developers. The result is a handy book that offers the bare essentials on web standards in a small, concise format that you can use carry anywhere for quick reference. This guide will literally fit into your back pocket.Inside HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference, you'll find instantly accessible alphabetical listings of every element and attribute in the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 Recommendations.

        "Authors": "By Ettlinger, Steve",
        "Description": "For consumers who have wondered about multisyllabic ingredients in processed foods, a New York author who has appeared on the Food Network and worked as a chef demystifies them. Drawing on interviews with industry professionals, Ettlinger reveals that these snack cakes and other popular products are concocted from byproducts of chlorine bleaching, gypsum mining, petroleum processing, and other chemicals also used in non-food products--which explains the Department of Homeland Security's role in food supply protection.

        "Title": "Horton Foote: America's Storyteller",
        "Authors": "By Hampton, Wilborn",
        "Description": "The first comprehensive biography of one of America\u2019s greatest playwrights, whose work\u2014from The Trip to Bountiful to the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird\u2014has helped shape American life for more than sixty years.  Horton Foote has garnered a Pulitzer Prize and two Academy Awards. Frank Rich, the drama critic for The New York Times, hailed him as \"one of America\u2019s living literary wonders,\" an artist whose subtlety \"suggests a collaboration between Faulkner and Chekhov.\" His work has touched millions and captured the soul of the nation more incisively than any other playwright, yet Horton Foote\u2019s own story is largely unknown to the general public.  Wilborn Hampton, a theater critic for The New York Times who has shared a friendship with Foote for twenty years, has crafted a colorful, compulsively readable biography that recounts Foote\u2019s rich life and extraordinary career, spanning much of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, and ranging from small-town Texas to Broadway to Hollywood. For six decades, through works such as Tender Mercies and The Young Man from Atlanta, Foote has chronicled the struggles of ordinary people to maintain their dignity in the face of hardship and change. Today, in his nineties, he is still vital and productive.  Hampton affords readers a unique view into his subject\u2019s life and work, his artistic inspirations, and his commitment to portraying American life as he saw it, even at times when no one would listen. Candid and compelling, this is a window into the heart and mind of an extraordinary talent, and into the psyche of America itself.",

Not so, argues Middle East expert Mark Perry. In the absence of dialogue, we have lumped these groups together with Al Qaeda as part of a monolithic enemy defined by a visceral hatred of American values. In reality, while they hold deep grievances about specific US policies, they are ultimately far more defined by their opposition to the deliberately anti-political Salafist ideology of Al Qaeda.Drawing on extensive interviews with Washington insiders, Perry describes fruitful covert meetings between members of the US armed forces and leaders of the Iraqi insurgency to demonstrate that talking to terrorists may be best way to end terrorism?controversial wisdom we ignore at our peril.",

Always work hard! This philosophy meant that when Thelma's daughter Monica founded Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day products (named after her mom), the products were designed to work hard for you.  Now for the first time, Thelma's sage advice is being made available in this revolutionary cleaning guide chock full of practical tips and secrets based on the premise that life is hectic and messy -- and so keeping your house clean and nice is the only sensible thing to do. With shortcuts and tips for cleaning the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living room, MRS MEYER'S CLEAN HOME contains unexpected advice such as: --Never use vinegar and water on wood floors. One part dish soap and four parts water is the only way to truly get them clean. And remember to buff with a terrycloth towel. --Always clean out the fridge before grocery shopping. Serve the kids \"Musko\" (\"must go\") for dinner, using the items that were fast approaching expiration. --Wash windows on a cloudy day to avoid the nasty streaking that happens when the sun's out and glass dry too fast.  MRS MEYER'S CLEAN HOME is two parts common sense and one part inspiration. Read it and learn how to clean like the dickens.",

Beginning with Chancellorsville, which set the stage for Robert E. Lee's second invasion of the North, and concluding with Lee's escape across the Potomac, noted historian Craig L. Symonds's brilliant narrative in the American Heritage\u00ae History of the Battle of Gettysburg details the three days in July when two armies struggled in a virtual death grip across a dozen square miles of rolling Pennsylvania countryside.Symonds encapsulates the grand sweep of the Pennsylvania battle by mapping both sides' military strategy, such as the Confederate decisionto invade Pennsylvania, the cat-and-mouse game as Lee's army moved north, and, finally, the terrible clash of arms on the hills and fields ofGettysburg. The book also draws upon first hand accounts from the front lines, humanizing the Blue and Gray -- the soldiers fighting for their lives and country. Richly illustrated with nearly three hundred photographs, color paintings, and illustrations, and with a wealth, of letters, diaries, and memoirs accompanying the text, this is the story of Gettysburg as it has never been told before.

Rather, he talks about the philosophy and implications of computer hacking. Thinking like a hacker, he says, will introduce readers to new worlds, not all of which are comfortable.

A tale of the prairie land encountered by America\u2019s Swedish, Czech, Bohemian, and French immigrants, as well as a story of how the land challenged them, changed them, and, in some cases, defeated them, Cather\u2019s novel is a uniquely American epic. Alexandra Bergson, a young Swedish immigrant girl who inherits her father\u2019s farm and must transform it from raw prairie into a prosperous enterprise, is the first of Cather\u2019s great heroines\u2014all of them women of strong will and an even stronger desire to overcome adversity and succeed. But the wild land itself is an equally important character in Cather\u2019s books, and her descriptions of it are so evocative, lush, and moving that they provoked writer Rebecca West to say of her: \u201cThe most sensuous of writers, Willa Cather builds her imagined world almost as solidly as our five senses build the universe around us.\u201dWilla Cather, perhaps more than any other American writer, was able to re-create the real drama of the pioneers, capturing for later generations a time, a place, and a spirit that has become part of our national heritage.",
